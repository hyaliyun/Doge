Having previously served as Prime Minister for five years, she is the longest-serving Prime Minister in the history of Bangladesh. Hasina is the daughter of Bangladesh's first President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the eldest of his five children. Her political career has spanned more than four decades. She previously served as Opposition Leader from 1986 to 1990, and 1991 to 1995, then as Prime Minister from 1996 to 2001. She has been leading the Bangladesh Awami League (AL) since 1981. In 2008, she returned as Prime Minister with a landslide victory. In January 2014, she became Prime Minister for a third term in an unopposed election, as it was boycotted by the Opposition, and criticised by international observers. She won a fourth term in December 2018, following an election marred with violence and criticised by the Opposition as being rigged. Hasina is considered one of the most powerful women in the world, ranking 26th on Forbes list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women in 2018, and 30th in 2017. She has also made a list of \\"top 100 Global Thinkers\\" of the present decade. Hasina is a member of the Council of Women World Leaders, an international network of current and former female presidents and prime ministers. Sheikh Hasina was included in Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World of 2018. Under her tenure as Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Bangladesh has experienced democratic backsliding. Background and early life Sheikh Hasina was born in Tungipara, East Pakistan on 28 September 1947. Her father was Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the 'father' of the Bengali Nation, and the first President of Bangladesh. Her mother was Sheikh Fazilatunnesa Mujib. She has said in many interviews that she had grown up in fear due to her father's' political works. She married physicist M. A. Wazed Miah in 1968, who was chosen for her by her father. During the peak of violence in the 1970 Pakistani general election, as well as her father's arrest, she had lived in refuge with her grandmother. She was active in the student politics of the University of Dhaka. Hasina was not in Bangladesh when her father, and most of her family, were assassinated on 15 August 1975 during a military coup d'√©tat by members of the Bangladesh Army. She was in West Germany where her husband, M. A. Wazed Miah, was working as a nuclear physicist. She moved to Delhi in late 1975 and was provided asylum by India. Her son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, studied at Indian boarding schools. During her time in India Hasina was not involved in politics, but became close friends with Suvra Mukherjee, wife of the future Indian President Pranab Mukherjee. Hasina was not allowed to return to Pakistan until after she was elected to lead the Awami League Party on 16 February 1981, and arrived home on 17 May 1981. She is the aunt of British MP Tulip Siddiq. Early political career= 1981‚Äì1991: Movement against military rule = While living in self-exile in India, Hasina was elected President of the Bangladesh Awami League (AL) in 1981. The AL has been described as a \\"left-of-center\\" party. Under martial law, Hasina was in and out of detention throughout the 1980s. In 1984, she was put under house arrest in February and again in November. In March 1985, she was put under house arrest for another three months. Her party, along with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) under Khaleda Zia, continued to work to restore democratically elected government, which they achieved by the democratic election in 1991, won by the BNP. Hasina and AL participated in the 1986 Bangladeshi general election held under President Hussain Muhammad Ershad. She served as the leader of the Parliamentary Opposition in 1986‚Äì1987. She led an eight-party alliance as opposition against Ershad. Hasina's decision to take part in the election had been criticised by her opponents, since the election was held under martial law, and the other main opposition group boycotted the poll. However, her supporters maintained that she used the platform effectively to challenge Ershad's rule. Ershad dissolved the parliament in December 1987 when Hasina and her Awami League resigned in an attempt to call for a fresh general election to be held under a neutral government. During November and December in 1987, a mass uprising happened in Dhaka and several people were killed, including Noor Hossain, a Hasina supporter. =1991‚Äì1996: Transition to democracy and Leader of the opposition= After several years of autocratic rule, widespread protests and strikes had paralysed the economy. Government officers refused to follow orders and resigned. Members of the Bangladesh Rifles laid down their weapons instead of firing on protestors and curfew was openly violated. Hasina worked with Khaleda Zia in organizing opposition to Ershad. A huge mass protest in December 1990 ousted Ershad from power when he resigned in favour of his vice president, Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed, the Chief Justice of the Bangladesh Supreme Court. The caretaker government, headed by Ahmed, administered a general election for the parliament. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party led by Khaleda Zia won a general majority, and Hasina's Awami League emerged as the largest opposition party. Among three constituencies Hasina fought, she lost in two and won in one. Accepting election defeat, She offered her resignation as the party president but stayed on at the request of party leaders. Politics in Bangladesh took a decisive turn in 1994, after a by-election in Magura, held after the death of the MP for that constituency, a member of Hasina's party. The Awami League had expected to win back the seat, but the BNP candidate won through rigging and manipulation, according to the neutral observer who came to witness the election. Hasina led the Bangladesh Awami League in boycotting the parliament from 1994. 1996‚Äì2001: First premiership Hasina with US President Bill Clinton at the Prime Minister's Office in Dhaka, 2000. The Awami League (AL), with other opposition parties, demanded that the next general elections be held under a neutral caretaker government, and that provision for caretaker governments to manage elections be incorporated in the constitution. The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) refused to act on these demands. Opposition parties launched an unprecedented campaign, calling strikes for weeks on end. The Government accused them of destroying the economy while the opposition countered that BNP could solve this problem by acceding to their demands. In late 1995, the MPs of AL and other parties resigned from parliament. Parliament completed its term and the 15 February 1996 Bangladeshi general election was held. The election was boycotted by all major parties except the ruling BNP, who won all the seats in the parliament as a result. Hasina described the election as a farce. The new Parliament, composed mostly of BNP members, amended the constitution to create provisions for a caretaker government (CTG). The 30 June 1996 Bangladeshi general elections were held under a neutral caretaker government headed by retired Chief Justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman. AL won the largest number of seats, 146, but fell short of the majority. Khaleda Zia, leader of the BNP who won 104 seats, denounced the results and alleged vote rigging. This was in contrast to what the neutral observers said, that the election was free and fair. Hasina served her first term as Prime Minister (PM) of Bangladesh from 1996 to 2001. She became the first Bangladeshi PM since its independence to complete the entire term. She signed the 30-year water sharing treaty of the Ganges with India. Her administration repealed the Indemnity Act, which protected the killers of Sheikh Muijib, her father and first President of Bangladesh. Her government opened the telecom industry, which till then was limited to government owned companies, to the private sector. In 1999 the government started the New Industrial Policy (NIP) which aimed to strengthen the private industry and encourage growth. Bangladesh joined two multilateral bodies, Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) and D-8 Organization for Economic Cooperation (D-8). The NIP allowed foreign companies to open 100 percent owned subsidiaries. In the 2001 Bangladeshi general election, although winning 40% of the popular vote (slightly less than BNP's 41%), AL won just 62 seats in the Parliament, while the 'Four Party Alliance' led by BNP won 234 seats, giving them a two-thirds majority in Parliament. Hasina herself ran in three constituencies, and was defeated in a constituency in Rangpur, which included her husband's home town, but won in two other seats. Hasina and AL rejected the results, claiming that the election was rigged with the help of the President and the caretaker government. The international community was largely satisfied with the elections, and the 'Four Party Alliance' went on to form the government.  2001‚Äì2008: Opposition period  The Awami League MPs were irregular in attending the Parliament during the following period. In late 2003, the Awami League started its first major anti-government movement, culminating in the declaration by party general secretary Abdul Jolil that the government would fall before 30 April 2004. This failed to happen and was seen as a blow to the party and Hasina, who had implicitly supported Jalil. =2004: Assassination attempt= During her second term as leader of the opposition, political unrest and violence increased. MP Ahsanullah Master died after he was shot in May 2004. This was followed by a grenade attack on 21 August on an Awami League gathering in Dhaka, resulting in the death of 24 party supporters, including Ivy Rahman, party women's secretary. On 10 October 2018, a special court gave verdicts in two cases filed over the incident; the court ruled that it was a well-orchestrated plan, executed through abuse of state power, and all the accused, including BNP Senior vice-chairman Tarique Rahman (in absentia) and former top intelligence officials, were found guilty. The court handed down various punishments. Shah A M S Kibria, Hasina's former finance minister, was also killed that year (2004) in a grenade attack in Sylhet. In June 2005, A. B. M. Mohiuddin Chowdhury, an incumbent of the Awami League, won the important mayoral election in Chittagong, the 'Port City' of, and second-largest city in, Bangladesh. This election was seen as a showdown between the opposition and the ruling party. = 2006‚Äì2008: Detention during the caretaker government and military intervention = The months preceding the planned 22 January 2007 elections were filled with political unrest and controversy. Following the end of Khaleda Zia's government in late October 2006, there were protests and strikes, during which 40 people were killed in the following month, over uncertainty about who would head the caretaker Government. The caretaker Government had difficulty bringing all parties to the table. AL and its allies protested and alleged that the caretaker Government favored the BNP. The interim period was marked by violence and strikes. Presidential Advisor Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury negotiated with Hasina and Khaleda Zia and brought all the parties to the planned 22 January 2007 parliamentary elections. Later Hussain Muhammad Ershad's nomination was cancelled; as a result, the Grand Alliance withdrew its candidates en masse on the last day possible. They demanded to have voters' lists published. Later in the month, President Iajuddin Ahmed was compelled to impose a state of emergency and thus Lt General Moeen Uddin Ahmed took over the Government. Political activity was prohibited. Fakhruddin Ahmed became the chief advisor with the support of the Bangladesh Army. In April 2007, Hasina was charged with graft and extortion by the military backed Caretaker Government during the 2006‚Äì08 Bangladeshi political crisis. She was accused of having forced Bangladeshi businessman Tajul Islam Farooq to pay bribes in 1998 before his company could build a power plant. Farooq said that he paid Hasina for approving his project. On 18 April 2007, the Government barred Hasina from returning, saying that she had made provocative statements and that her return could cause disorder. This was described as a temporary measure. The Caretaker Government had also been trying to get Khaleda Zia to leave the country.\\"Bangladeshi gov't bans former PM's return home from USA\\", Xinhua. People's Daily, 18 April 2007. Hasina vowed to return home, and on 22 April 2007, a warrant was issued for her arrest for murder.\\"Bangladesh issues ex-PM warrant\\", BBC News, 22 April 2007. Describing the case against her as \\"totally false and fake\\", Hasina said that she wanted to defend herself against the charges in court. On 23 April 2007, the arrest warrant was suspended, and on 25 April 2007, the ban on Hasina's entry was dropped.\\"Opposition welcomes B'desh U-turn\\", BBC News, 26 April 2007. After spending 51 days in the United States and the UK, on 7 May 2007 Hasina returned to Dhaka, where she was greeted by a crowd of several thousand. She told reporters that the Government should not have delayed her return. On 16 July 2007, Hasina was arrested by police at her home and taken before a local court in Dhaka.\\"Former Bangladeshi PM arrested: Reports\\", Reuters (Australian Broadcasting Corporation News Online), 16 July 2007. Retrieved 16 July 2007. She was accused of extortion and denied bail, and was held in a building converted into a jail on the premises of the National Parliament. AL said the arrest was politically motivated. On 17 July 2007, the Anti-Corruption Commission sent notices to both Hasina and Khaleda Zia, instructing them to provide details of their assets within one week.\\"Hasina, Khaleda given 7 days for wealth report\\", The Daily Star, 18 July 2007, Vol. 5 Num 1113. Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy was out of the country, and said he would try to organise worldwide protest. These arrests of the political leaders were widely seen as a move by the military- backed interim Government to force Hasina and Zia out of the country and into political exile. United Kingdom MPs condemned the arrest.\\"UK MPs denounce Bangladesh arrest\\", BBC News, 23 July 2007. On 11 April 2007, the police filed murder charges against Hasina, alleging that she masterminded the killing in October 2006 of four supporters of a rival political party. The four alleged victims were beaten to death during clashes between AL and rival party activists. Hasina was visiting the United States at the time.\\"B'desh's Hasina to stay abroad pending murder charge\\", Reuters, 12 April 2007. On 30 July 2007, the Dhaka High Court suspended Hasina's extortion trial and ordered her release on bail. On 2 September 2007, an additional case was filed against Hasina by the Anti-Corruption Commission regarding the awarding of a contract for the construction of a power plant in 1997, for which she allegedly took a bribe of 30 million takas and kept the contract from going to the lowest bidder. Six others were also accused of involvement.\\"Detained ex-PM of Bangladesh faces new graft charges\\", The Times of India, 3 September 2007. A graft case was filed against Zia on the same day. On 13 January 2008, Hasina was indicted on extortion charges by a special court along with two of her relatives, her sister Sheikh Rehana and her cousin Sheikh Selim. On 6 February, the High Court stopped the trial, ruling that she could not be prosecuted under emergency laws for crimes alleged to have been committed prior to the imposition of the state of emergency. On 11 June 2008, Hasina was released on parole for medical reasons. The next day she flew to the United States to be treated for hearing impairment, eye problems and high blood pressure. Syed Modasser Ali, her personal physician, threatened to sue the caretaker Government over negligence regarding Hasina's treatment during her detention. The caretaker Government held mayoral elections in which AL won 12 out of 13 mayoral elections. The caretaker Government extended her two-month medical parole by one more month. 2009‚Äì2014: Second premiership Hasina with British PM David Cameron in London (January 2011) On 6 November 2008, Hasina returned to Bangladesh to attend the 2008 Bangladeshi general election scheduled for 29 December. She decided to participate in the parliamentary election under the name of \\"Grand Alliance\\" with the Jatiya Party, led by Hussain Muhammad Ershad, as its main partner. On 11 December 2008, Hasina formally announced her party's election manifesto during a news conference, and vowed to build a \\"Digital Bangladesh\\" by 2021. Her Bangladesh Awami League and its Grand Alliance (a total of 14 parties) won the 2008 general election with a two-thirds majority numerically the party controlled 230 seats out of 299.\\"Hasina wins Bangladesh landslide\\", BBC Khaleda Zia leader of the BNP-led coalition (4-Party Alliance) rejected the results of the election by questioning the Chief Election Commissioner \\"for stage-managing the parliamentary election\\". Hasina was sworn into office as the Prime Minister for the second time on 6 January 2009. Independent observers declared the elections were held in a festive and peaceful atmosphere. After being Prime Minister, Hasina reneged on her agreement with the Jatiya Party to make Ershad, its leader, the President. Hasina removed many of her parties politicians who supported reforms forced by the previous caretaker Government. She had to confront a major national crisis in the form of the 2009 Bangladesh Rifles revolt over a pay dispute, that resulted in 75 deaths including Bangladesh Army officers. Some Bangladesh Army officers blamed Hasina for the deaths by not sending in the Army earlier. In 2011, the Parliament removed the law that required non-party Caretaker government hold elections. In 2012, she maintained a hard line stance and refused to allow entry to Rohingya refugees fleeing Myanmar during the 2012 Rakhine State riots. Hasina with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in January 2013 On 27 June 2013, a case against Hasina and 24 other Bangladeshi Ministers and security personnel was lodged at the International Criminal Court (ICC) for the alleged violation of human rights. She has been \\"credited internationally\\" for the achievement of some of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. In 2012 a coup attempt against her by mid ranking army officers was stopped, with the Bangladesh Army being tipped off by an Indian intelligence agency. The Bangladesh Army described the army officers involved as being Islamic extremists. In 2012, she had a falling out with Muhammad Yunus, Nobel laureate and founder of Grameen Bank, following a Norwegian documentary that was critical of Yunus transferring money from Grameen Bank to an affiliate organisation. Yunus transferred the money back after the documentary aired but it increased scrutiny of the Bank by the Government and media in Bangladesh. Yunus lost control of his Bank following a court verdict. He criticised Hasina and other Bangladeshi politicians. She responded by saying she did not understand why Yunus blamed her when it was a court verdict that removed him from Grameen Bank. During this term, her Government led and succeeded in forming the International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh), to investigate and prosecute suspects involved in the Bangladesh genocide, committed by the Pakistan Army and their local collaborators, Razakars, Al-Badr, and Al-Shams during the Bangladesh Liberation war in 1971. 2014‚Äì2019: Third premiership Hasina with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, 2018 Sheikh Hasina secured a third successive term in office with her ruling Awami League and its Grand Alliance partners, winning the 11th general election by a landslide. With 267 seats under its belt this time, the ruling alliance surpassed its 2008 poll success ‚Äì when it secured 263 parliamentary seats. Sheikh Hasina's Awami League has run Bangladesh since 2009 and won 288 seats in this election. One of the leading opposition parties accused it of using stuffed ballot boxes. BNP, the main opposition party that has been out of power for 12 years and boycotted the 10th general polls in 2014, fared extremely poorly. Bagging only eight seats, the party and its Jatiya Oikya Front alliance have been marginalized to the weakest opposition ever, since Bangladesh's post-Ershad democratic restoration in 1991. A general election was held in January 2014 which was boycotted by the major parties of the opposition alliance, including BNP. The election was controversial with reports of violence and an alleged crackdown on the opposition in the run-up to the election. 153 seats (of 300) went uncontested in the election, of which Awami League won 127 by default. Hasina's Awami League won a safe parliamentary majority with a total of 234 seats. As a result of the boycott and violence voter turnout was lower than the previous few elections at only 51%. The day after the result, Hasina said that the boycott should \\"not mean there will be a question of legitimacy. People participated in the poll and other parties participated.\\" Despite the controversy Hasina went on to form a Government with Ershad's Jatiya Party (who won 34 seats) as the official opposition. Hasina with G7 Leaders and guests, Shima Kanko Hotel in Japan, 2016 The election has been called \\"an electoral farce\\". The BNP wanted the elections to be held under a neutral caretaker Government and had hoped to use protests to force the government to do so. In March 2017, Bangladesh's first two submarines were commissioned. In September 2017, Hasina's government gave temporary shelter and aid to about a million Rohingya refugees and urged Myanmar to end violence against Rohingya Muslims.Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina visits Rohingya refugees, assures help The Indian Express.13 September 2017 The majority of the Bangladeshi people supported the government decision to provide refugee to Rohingya. Hasina received credit and praise for her actions. Hasina supported calls to remove the Statue of Justice in Bangladesh Supreme Court. With some people saying the Government was bowing down to the pressure of those who have used religion for political ends. Hasina is a patron of the Asian University for Women, led by Chancellor Cherie Blair, and including the First Lady of Japan, Akie Abe, as well as Irina Bokova, the Director-General of UNESCO.  2019‚Äìpresent: Fourth premiership  Hasina won her third consecutive term, her fourth overall, when her Bangladesh Awami League won 288 of the 300 parliamentary seats. The leader of the main Opposition party, Kamal Hossain, declared the vote \\"farcical\\" and rejected the results. Before the election, Human Rights Watch and other rights organisations had accused the Government of creating an intimidating environment for the Opposition. The New York Times editorial board described the election as farcical, the editorial stated that it was likely Hasina would have won without vote rigging and questioned why she did so.  Controversies  The Padma Bridge graft scandal was a political incident in Bangladesh that involved the ruling Bangladesh Awami League's government who allegedly sought, in exchange for the awarding of the construction contract, a large amount money from the Canadian construction company SNC-Lavalin. The allegations were subsequently found to be false and without merit, and the Canadian Court subsequently dismissed the case. As a result of the allegations, The World Bank pulled out of a project to build Bangladesh's largest bridge, citing corruption concerns, cancelling $1.2bn (¬£764m) credit for the 6 km-long (four miles) road-rail bridge over the Padma River. Hasina removed the Communication Minister Syed Abul Hossain from office three months after dismissal of the case. On 11 July 2012, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said the Awami League government should make public a letter sent by the World Bank, wherein the Bank brought graft charges against Hasina and three other figures. On 17 January 2016, Sheikh Hasina stated that an MD of a bank from the USA provoked the WB to cancel the loan. On 24 January 2017, in a speech in parliament, Prime Minister Hasina blamed Muhammad Yunus for the World Bank's pulling out of the project. According to her, Yunus lobbied with the former United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to persuade the World Bank to terminate the loan. On 10 February 2017, an Ontario (Canada) Superior court justice dismissed the bribery-conspiracy case for lack of any proof. In 2018 Hasina's government passed the controversial \\"Digital Security Act 2018\\", under which any criticisms of the Government over the internet or any other media, would be met with various degrees of prison terms. This was heavily criticized both domestically and internationally for suppressing peoples freedom of speech as well as undermining press freedom in Bangladesh. Personal life Hasina married M. A.

It is the sequel to the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs, in which Anthony Hopkins returns to his role as the serial killer Hannibal Lecter. Julianne Moore co-stars, in the role first held by Jodie Foster, as FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling. The film had a difficult and occasionally troubling pre-production history. When the novel was published in 1999, The Silence of the Lambs director Jonathan Demme, screenwriter Ted Tally, and actress Jodie Foster all declined to be involved in its adaptation. Ridley Scott became attached as director after the success of Gladiator (2000), and eventually signed onto the project after reading the script pitched by Dino De Laurentiis, who produced Manhunter (1986), which was based on the 1981 Harris novel Red Dragon. After the departure of Foster and screenwriter Tally, Julianne Moore took on Foster's role while David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote the screenplay. Set ten years after The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal follows Starling's attempts to apprehend Lecter before his surviving victim, Mason Verger, captures him. It is set in Italy and the United States. The novel Hannibal drew attention for its violence. Hannibal broke box office records in the United States, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom in February 2001, but was met with a mixed to negative critical reception. Plot Ten years after tracking down serial killer Jame Gumb, FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling is unjustly blamed for a botched drug raid. She is later contacted by Mason Verger, the only surviving victim of the serial killer Hannibal Lecter. A wealthy child molester, Verger was paralyzed and brutally disfigured by Lecter during a therapy session. He has been pursuing an elaborate scheme to capture, torture, and kill Lecter ever since. Using his wealth and political influence, Verger has Starling reassigned to Lecter's case, hoping her involvement will draw Lecter out. After learning of Starling's public disgrace, Lecter sends her a taunting letter. Starling detects a fragrance from the letter. A perfume expert later identifies a skin cream with ingredients that are only available to a few shops in the world. She contacts the police departments of the cities where the shops are located, requesting surveillance tapes. In Florence, one of the cities listed, Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi is investigating the disappearance of a library curator. Pazzi questions Lecter, who is masquerading as Dr. Fell, the assistant curator and caretaker. Upon recognizing Dr. Fell in the surveillance tape, Pazzi accesses the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program database of wanted fugitives. He then learns of Verger's US$3 million personal bounty on Lecter. Blinded by greed, Pazzi ignores Starling's warnings and attempts to capture Lecter alone. He recruits a pickpocket to obtain Lecter's fingerprint to show Verger as proof. The pickpocket, mortally wounded by Lecter, manages to get the print and gives it to Pazzi. Lecter baits Pazzi into an isolated room of the Palazzo Vecchio, ties him up, then disembowels and hangs him from the balcony. Lecter then returns to the United States. Verger bribes Justice Department official Paul Krendler to accuse Starling of withholding a note from Lecter, leading to her suspension. Lecter lures Starling to Union Station. Verger's men, having trailed Starling, capture and bring Lecter to Verger. Verger intends to feed Lecter alive to a herd of wild boars bred specifically for this purpose. After her superiors refuse to act, Starling infiltrates Verger's estate. After neutralizing the two guards and freeing Lecter, she is shot by a third guard who was in hiding. Lecter picks up an unconscious Starling just before the boars break through the doors. Verger orders his physician Cordell Doemling to shoot Lecter, but, with Lecter's suggestion, Cordell shoves his hated boss into the pen. Lecter carries Starling away and the boars eat Verger alive. Lecter takes Starling to Krendler's secluded lake house and treats her wounds. When Krendler arrives for the Fourth of July, Lecter subdues and drugs him. Starling, disoriented by morphine and dressed in a black velvet cocktail dress, awakens to find Krendler seated at the table set for an elegant dinner. Weakened by the drugs, she looks on in horror as Lecter removes part of Krendler's prefrontal cortex, saut√©s it, and feeds it to him. After the meal, Starling tries to attack Lecter, but he overpowers her. She handcuffs his wrist to hers. Hearing the police and ambulance closing in, Lecter is just about to sever her cuffed hand to escape when he hesitates. She is soon seen to have both hands intact when she escapes. The paramedics take Krendler to the hospital. His fate is not explained. Lecter is later shown on a flight with his own boxed lunch, his bandaged arm in a sling. As he prepares to eat his meal, including what is assumed to be a piece of Krendler's brain, a young boy seated next to him asks to try some of his food. Lecter shares the brain with the boy, saying his mother told him it is important \\"always to try new things.\\" Cast * Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter / Dr. Fell * Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling * Gary Oldman as Mason Verger * Ray Liotta as Paul Krendler * Frankie R.

Demme responded that Thomas Harris, author of The Silence of the Lambs, had been working on the follow-up for \\"seven or eight years\\". Demme had an idea even at that time that it would not be a straight follow-up. Harris had told Demme: \\"I imagine Doctor Lecter going somewhere in Europe ... strolling round the streets of Florence or Munich, gazing in the windows of watchmakers ...\\" Demme stated his intention to be involved in the film adaptation of Hannibal in 1998, less than a year before the novel was published.Hannibal DVD \\"Making of feature\\" Dino De Laurentiis produced Michael Mann's film Manhunter in 1986, based on Harris's 1981 novel Red Dragon, featuring the first appearance of Hannibal Lecter, played by Brian Cox. De Laurentiis did not like Mann's film: \\"Manhunter was no good ... it was not Red Dragon,\\" he said. De Laurentiis and his wife Martha (also his co- producer) had no direct involvement in The Silence of the Lambs, a decision De Laurentiis came to regret. They did, however, own the rights to the Lecter character and reportedly allowed Orion Pictures, which produced The Silence of the Lambs, to use the character of Lecter for free, not wishing to be \\"greedy\\". When The Silence of the Lambs became a commercial and critical success in 1991, winning five Academy Awards, both Dino and Martha De Laurentiis found themselves sitting on a valuable asset and eager for a follow-up novel they could adapt. After a lengthy wait, De Laurentiis finally received a call from Harris telling him he had finished the sequel to The Silence of the Lambs and De Laurentiis purchased the rights for a record $10 million. In April 1999, Los Angeles Times reported that the budget for an adaptation of Hannibal could cost as much as $100 million. It speculated that both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins would receive $15 million each to reprise their roles and \\"$5 million to $19 million for director Jonathan Demme.\\" The newspaper further reported: although The Silence of the Lambs cost only $22 million, this would not deter the studio from going ahead with Hannibal. Mort Janklow, Harris's agent at the time, told Los Angeles Times that Foster, Hopkins, and Demme would soon receive manuscripts of the novel, claiming it would make an unbelievable film. The novel sold out of its initial 1.6 million print run in the summer of 1999. Hannibal went on to sell millions of copies following its release. Demme informed the producers of Hannibal that he would pass on directing the film. It has been claimed Demme turned down the project because he found the material \\"lurid\\" and was averse to the novel's \\"gore\\". In the 2010 Biography Channel documentary Inside Story: The Silence of the Lambs, Demme commented, \\"It was a foregone conclusion that when a new book came out, the team that made Silence of the Lambs would make that movie. And Tom Harris, as unpredictable as ever, took Clarice and Dr. Lecter's relationship in a direction that just didn't compute for me. And Clarice is drugged up, and she's eating brains with him, and I just thought, 'I can't do this.'\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomRnogIdHE De Laurentiis said of Demme's decision to decline: \\"When the pope dies, we create a new pope. Good luck to Jonathan Demme. Good-bye.\\" He has since added that Demme felt he could not make a sequel as good as The Silence of the Lambs. =Ridley Scott= De Laurentiis visited Ridley Scott on the set of Gladiator and suggested to Ridley he read the novel he had bought the rights to. Scott was in the third week before principal photography was due to finish on Gladiator. Gladiator became a commercial and critical success, earning 12 Academy Award nominations. De Laurentiis asked Scott if he would like to direct the film version of Hannibal. Scott misunderstood which Hannibal he meant, thinking De Laurentiis was speaking of the general and historical figure from Carthage who nearly brought down the Roman Empire back around 200 B.C., so he replied: \\"Basically, Dino, I'm doing a Roman epic right now. I don't wanna do elephants coming over the Alps next, old boy.\\" Scott read the manuscript in four sittings within a week, believing it to be a \\"symphony\\", and expressed his desire to do it. Scott further explains how he got involved: \\"I was shooting Gladiator in Malta and one day, for the hell of it, I went for a walk for half a mile down the road to the Malta Film Studio to see my old buddy Dino. I had not seen him since I'd worked on a version of Dune. This was pre-Blade Runner. Dino had pursued me to direct Dune and another film. He's always enthusiastic and aggressive and came after me when I did both Blade Runner and Alien, but I couldn't do the films. Anyway, we had an espresso together and a few days later, he called me to ask if he could visit the Gladiator set. He arrived with a manuscript of Hannibal, about a month before it was published in book form. He said: 'Let's make this one.' I haven't read anything so fast since The Godfather. It was so rich in all kind of ways.\\" Although Scott had accepted the job Demme had rejected, he said: \\"My first question was: 'What about Jonathan?' and they said: 'The original team said it's too violent.' I said, 'Okay. I'll do it.'\\" Scott did, himself, have some uncertainty with the source material. In particular, he had difficulties with the ending of the novel, in which Lecter and Starling become lovers: \\"I couldn't take that quantum leap emotionally on behalf of Starling. Certainly, on behalf of Hannibal‚ÄîI'm sure that's been in the back of his mind for a number of years. But for Starling, no. I think one of the attractions about Starling to Hannibal is what a straight arrow she is.\\" He also \\"didn't buy the book from the opera scene onwards, which became like a vampire movie.\\" He asked Harris if he was \\"married to his ending\\". Harris said he was not, so Scott changed it. =Script development= Ted Tally, the screenwriter for The Silence of the Lambs, was another key member of the original team to decline involvement in Hannibal (he won an Academy Award for his Silence adaptation). Tally, like Demme, had problems with the novel's \\"excesses\\". Steven Zaillian (writer of Schindler's List) was offered the chance to write the adaptation after Tally passed, but he also declined. He explained that \\"I was busy. And I wasn't sure I was interested. You can almost never win when you do a sequel.\\" David Mamet was the first screenwriter to produce a draft, which, according to Ridley Scott and the producers, needed major revisions. Stacey Snider, co-chairman of Universal Pictures (a co-production deal was struck between Universal and MGM) said on the rejection of Mamet's screenplay: \\"There's no way David was going to read 15 pages of our notes and then be available to work on the script day- to-day.\\" Mamet was preparing to direct his own film. Zaillian, who had already passed, reconsidered and became involved in the project, saying: \\"It's hard to say no to Dino once and it's almost impossible to say no to him twice.\\" A script review at ScreenwritersUtopia.com describes the Mamet draft as \\"stunningly bad\\" but found Zaillian's rewrite to be \\"gripping entertainment\\". This question (regarding the script development) was put to Ridley Scott by Total Film magazine: \\"There were lots of rewrites on Hannibal‚Äîwhat was the main problem with the original material?\\" Scott replied: \\"That's inaccurate, because there were very few rewrites once I brought in Steve Zaillian. If you were to ask who were the best three screenwriters in the business, Steve Zaillian would be one of them. We discussed Hannibal endlessly.\\" Asked if he had read Mamet's draft, he said: \\"Yes. He is very fast, very efficient, but he was off doing a film. 'Hannibal' was green lit and his first draft only took about a month. But I was scared that he would not be able to give me enough attention, because that draft needed a lot of work. So I moved on basically.\\" Scott has said there were writing and \\"structural problems\\" as to what they would do with parts of the film. One of Zaillian's key objectives was to revise the script by David Mamet until it pleased all parties, meaning the \\"love\\" story would need to be done by suggestion instead of by \\"assault\\". Scott worked through the script with Zaillian for 28 days making him \\"sweat through it with him and discuss every inch of the way with him.\\" After 25 days Scott suddenly realized that Zaillian was \\"exorcising the 600 pages of the book. He was distilling through discussion what he was gonna finally do ... Frankly I could have just made it.\\" =Casting= It was unclear if Jodie Foster (Clarice Starling) and Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter) would reprise their respective roles for which they won Academy Awards in The Silence of the Lambs (best actress/actor). It became apparent that the producers and the studio could do without one of the original \\"stars\\" and would go on to find a replacement. The withdrawal of both Foster and Hopkins could possibly have been terminal for the project, however. De Laurentiis confirmed this after the film's release: \\"First and foremost, I knew we had no movie without Anthony Hopkins.\\" Involvement of Jodie Foster Regarding her involvement in a sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, Foster confirmed to Larry King in 1997 that she \\"would definitely be part of it.\\" She told Entertainment Weekly magazine in 1997 that \\"Anthony Hopkins always talks about it. I mean, everybody wants to do it. Every time I see him, it's like: 'When is it going to happen? When is it going to happen?'\\" De Laurentiis thought Foster would decline once she read the book, even believing the final film was better for it. Hopkins also had doubts Foster would be involved, saying he had a \\"hunch\\" she would not be. Foster did turn it down, confirming this in late December 1999. This would cause problems for the studio, Universal and partner MGM. \\"The studio is just back from the holiday and is regrouping based on the news, and has no cohesive game plan at the moment,\\" said Kevin Misher, Universal's President of Production. Misher added that, \\"It was one of those moments when you sit down and think, 'Can Clarice be looked upon as James Bond for instance? A character who is replaceable?' Or was Jodie Foster Clarice Starling, and the audience will not accept anyone else?\\" Foster said in December 1999 that the characterization of Starling in Hannibal had \\"negative attributes\\" and \\"betrayed\\" the original character. Foster's spokeswoman said the actress declined because Claire Danes had become available for Foster's own project, Flora Plum. Entertainment Weekly described the project as becoming \\"a bloody mess, hemorrhaging talent and money\\" despite Hopkins being on-board.Foster talked about Hannibal in an interview with Total Film in late 2005. She said: \\"The official reason I didn't do Hannibal is I was doing another movie, Flora Plum. So I get to say, in a nice dignified way, that I wasn't available when that movie was being shot ... Clarice meant so much to Jonathan and I, she really did, and I know it sounds kind of strange to say but there was no way that either of us could really trample on her.\\" Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling When it became clear that Foster would skip Hannibal, the production team considered several different actresses, including Cate Blanchett, Angelina Jolie, Gillian Anderson, Hilary Swank, Ashley Judd, Helen Hunt and Julianne Moore. Hopkins asked his agent if he had any \\"power\\" over casting. He informed De Laurentiis that he knew Moore, with whom he had worked on Surviving Picasso, and thought her a \\"terrific actress\\". Although Hopkins' agent told him he had no contractual influence on casting, Scott thought it correct to discuss who would be Hopkins' \\"leading lady\\". Scott said he was \\"really surprised to find that [he] had five of the top actresses in Hollywood wanting it.\\" Moore would eventually secure the part. Scott said his decision was swayed in favor of Moore because: \\"She is a true chameleon. She can be a lunatic in Magnolia, a vamp in An Ideal Husband, a porn star in Boogie Nights and a romantic in The End of the Affair.\\" \\"Julianne Moore, once Jodie decided to pass, was always top of my list,\\" said Scott on his female lead.Hannibal DVD \\"Ridley Scott commentary\\" Moore talked about stepping into a role made famous by another actress: \\"The new Clarice would be very different. Of course people are going to compare my interpretation with that of Jodie Foster's ... but this film is going to be very different.\\" Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter Hannibal Lecter t-shirt worn by Hopkins in Hannibal on display at the London Film Museum Hopkins was generally expected to reprise his Academy Award-winning role. Hopkins did say in June 1999 that he would only be interested if the script was \\"really good\\". Hopkins says on the making-of feature on DVD that he could not make up his mind to commit. \\"I was kind of surprised by this book, Hannibal. I thought it was really overreaching and so bizarre. So I couldn't make up my mind about it all. Some of it I found intriguing, some I was a little doubtful about.\\" When the producers confirmed that they were going to film Harris' novel, Hopkins told them yes, but added: \\"It needs some condensing.\\" The Hollywood Reporter would confirm that Hopkins had agreed to reprise his role in late December 1999, saying he had approved the latest draft of the script by Steven Zaillian. Hopkins said he had no difficulty moving back into \\"Lecter's mind\\". \\"I just learned the lines and showed up and walked around as Hannibal Lecter. I thought, 'Do I repeat that same performance, or do I vary it?' Ten years had passed so I changed a bit.\\" In the book, Lecter uses bandages to disguise himself as a plastic surgery patient. This was left out of the film because Scott and Hopkins agreed to leave the face alone. Hopkins explains why: \\"It's as if he's making a statement‚Äî'catch me if you can'. With his big hat, he's so obvious that nobody thinks he's Hannibal Lecter. I've always thought he's a very elegant man, a Renaissance man.\\" In the film, Lecter is first seen in Florence \\"as the classical Lecter, lecturing and being smooth\\", according to Hopkins. When the film moves to the U.S., Hopkins changed his appearance by building up muscle and cropping his hair short \\"to make him like a mercenary, that he would be so fit and so strong that he could just snap somebody in two if they got ... in his way\\". Gary Oldman as Mason Verger The part of Mason Verger, one of Lecter's two surviving victims, was originally offered to Christopher Reeve based on his work as a wheelchair-bound police officer in Above Suspicion (1995). Not having read the novel, Reeve showed initial interest in the role, but ultimately declined upon realizing that Verger was a quadriplegic, facially-disfigured child rapist.Johnson, Malcolm. \\"A Heroic Persona\\". Hartford Courant. 12 October 2004. Retrieved 22 July 2012. The part was later accepted by secondary choice Gary Oldman. Co-producer Martha De Laurentiis claimed they had a \\"funny situation\\" with Oldman wanting a prominent \\"credit\\". She said: \\"Now how can you have a prominent credit with Hannibal? The characters are Hannibal and Clarice Starling. So we really couldn't work something out (at first).\\" Oldman was apparently \\"out\\" of the film for a while, but then came back in, asking to go \\"unbilled\\". Oldman would become transformed and \\"unrecognizable as himself\\" to play the part of Verger. He would have no lips, cheeks or eyelids. Make-up artist Greg Cannom said: \\"It's really disgusting ... I've been showing people pictures [of Oldman as Verger], and they all just say 'Oh my God,' and walk away, which makes me very happy.\\" Oldman said that having his name completely removed from the billing and credits allowed him to \\"do it anonymously\\" under the heavy make-up.IGN.com: Interview with Gary Oldman In home-release versions of the film, Oldman's name is included in the closing credits. Further casting Other stars subsequently cast included Ray Liotta as U.S. Justice Department official Paul Krendler (the character had appeared in The Silence of the Lambs, but original actor Ron Vawter had died in the interim) and Italian actor Giancarlo Giannini as Detective Rinaldo Pazzi. Francesca Neri played Pazzi's wife, Allegra. Frankie Faison reprised his role as orderly Barney Matthews, remaining the only actor to play a role in all Hannibal feature films (until Hannibal Rising in 2007), including Manhunter. =Key production crew= Scott recruited key production crew whom he had worked with previously. Production designer Norris Spencer had worked on Thelma & Louise, Black Rain and 1492: Conquest of Paradise. Cinematographer John Mathieson, editor Pietro Scalia and composer Hans Zimmer had all worked on Scott's previous film Gladiator.Official Hannibal production notes Production and post-production=Background= Hannibal was filmed in 83 working days over 16 weeks.Official Hannibal Journal The film began production on 8 May 2000 in Florence. The film visited key locations in Florence and various locations around the United States. Martha De Laurentiis said the film has almost a hundred locations and that it was a \\"constant pain of moving and dressing sets. But the locations were beautiful. Who could complain about being allowed to shoot in Palazzo Vecchio in Florence? Or President James Madison's farm in Montpelier or the amazing Biltmore Estate in Asheville?\\" Eighty million dollars and a year and a half in production were spent before Scott got his first look at Hannibal in the editing room. =Filming locations= *The whole second act of Hannibal takes place in Florence. Ridley Scott had never filmed there before, but described it as \\"quite an experience ... It was kind of organized chaos ... We were there at the height of tourist season.\\" Within Florence, the production would visit various locations such as the Palazzo Capponi (as Dr. Fell's workplace), the Ponte Vecchio, the Palazzo Vecchio, the Pharmacy of Santa Maria Novella and the Cathedral. *After leaving Italy on 5 June 2000, the production moved to Washington, D.C. Filming took place over six days at Union Station. The unusual sight of a carousel would appear in the transportation hub and shopping plaza at Ridley Scott's request. *Filming would last for seven weeks in Richmond, Virginia for the shootout in a crowded fish market (shot at Richmond Farmer's Market) early in the film. Julianne Moore underwent Federal Bureau of Investigation training at the Bureau's headquarters before filming. *A barn in Orange, Virginia, situated on the estate of President James Madison, was used to house 15 \\"performing hogs\\". The 15 Russian boars used in the shoot were from a selection of around 6,000 that the animal wranglers observed. *Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina, the biggest privately owned estate in the U.S., was chosen to signify the huge personal wealth of Mason Verger. =Special make-up effects= Make-up artist Greg Cannom was pleased to be involved in Hannibal as it offered him the chance to produce \\"incredible and original make-ups\\". For Mason Verger, the make-up team would initially produce 20 different heads which looked like zombies and did not reflect the vision Scott had of the character; Scott wanted Verger to look real with hideous scarring, and not something from the \\"House of Wax\\". Scott himself would actually call up the help of expert doctors in an effort to get the look of the character as realistic as possible. Scott showed the make-up team pictures of foetal things, which he thought touching; he wanted to make Mason Verger more touching than monstrous, as he thought of Verger as being someone who hadn't lost his sense of humour ... almost sympathetic. Oldman would spend six hours a day in make-up to prepare for the role. For one of the film's final and infamous scenes, an exact duplicate was created of the character Paul Krendler, played by Ray Liotta, a scene which blended make-up, puppet work and CGI in a way which Scott called \\"seamless\\". =Title sequence= The main titles were designed by Nick Livesey, a graduate of the Royal College of Art who worked for one of Scott's production companies in London. The sequence, shot in Florence by Livesey himself was intended as the film's second promotional trailer. The studio thought it not \\"quite right\\", but it remained on Scott's mind and would eventually end up as the main title sequence. Livesey would gather footage of pigeons in an empty square in Florence early one morning which, in the final cut, would morph into the face of Hannibal Lecter. Scott believed it a good idea, as it fundamentally asked the question: 'Where is Hannibal Lecter?' Scott explains: \\"And of course this story tells it, with pigeons in the cobblestones of somewhere, where you wonder where that is ... and there he is... his face appears.\\" The titles are said to have been influenced by the film Seven. =Music= Ridley Scott worked very closely with composer Hans Zimmer, during post-production on Hannibal. Scott believes the music to a film is as important as dialogue‚Äî\\"It is the final adjustment to the screenplay, being able to also adjust the performance of the actors in fact.\\" Zimmer and Scott sat in during the editing process with editor Pietro Scalia to discuss scenes in the film and \\"not music\\". Zimmer used a symphony orchestra for the opera sequence, but would mostly use what he described as a \\"very odd orchestra ... only cellos and basses all playing at the extreme ends of their range.\\" This was done to emphasise the character of Hannibal Lecter. He explains: \\"Anthony's character is for me somebody at the extreme range of whatever is humanly imaginable somehow.\\" Zimmer also did not want the score to sound like a \\"modern day orchestra\\". The character Mason Verger had his own \\"theme\\", which become more \\"perverted\\" as the film progressed, according to Zimmer. Dante's sonnet was put to music by Zimmer and Patrick Cassidy titled Vide cor Meum for the opera scene in Florence. Tracksounds.com wrote positively of Zimmer's score. \\"Zimmer truly crafts a score worthy of most fans' full attention ... the classical elements, and yes, even the monologue combine to make this an intense listening experience.\\" In a poll by British Classic FM listeners to find the greatest film soundtrack of all time, Hannibal ranked at 59. Strauss's The Blue Danube is also played at several points in the film. Themes=Romance= Scott has said he believes the underlying emotion of Hannibal is \\"affection\\". \\"In some instances, you might even wonder or certainly from one direction‚Äîis it more than affection? It is dark, because the story is of course essentially dark, but it's kind of romantic at the same time.\\" Scott openly admits to a \\"romantic thematic\\" running through the film. He told CNN that: \\"Hannibal was quite a different target, essentially a study between two individuals. Funny enough, it's rather romantic and also quite humorous, but also there's some quite bad behaviour as well.\\" During the opera scene in Florence, Lecter attends an operatic adaptation of one of Dante's sonnets, and meets with Detective Pazzi and his wife, Allegra. She asks Lecter, \\"Do you believe a man could become so obsessed by a woman after a single encounter?\\" Lecter replies: \\"Yes, I believe he could ... but would she see through the bars of his plight and ache for him?\\" This scene, in the film, is one which Scott claims most people \\"missed\\" the meaning of. It was in reference to Starling‚Äîto their encounter in The Silence of the Lambs. The New York Times, in its review of the film, said Hannibal, \\"toys\\" with the idea of \\"love that dare not speak its name\\". Composer Hans Zimmer believes there to be \\"many\\" messages and subtext in each scene of the film. He said, \\"I can score this movie truly as a Freudian archetypal beauty and the beast fairy tale, as a horror movie, as the most elegant piece, on corruption in the American police force, as the loneliest woman on earth, the beauty in renaissance ...\\" Zimmer ultimately believes it to be a dark love story, centering on two people who should never be together‚Äîa modern day Romeo and Juliet. During the film's post-production, Scott, Zimmer and the editor passionately argued about what a single shot meant, where a tear slides down Starling's cheek during a confrontation with Lecter. They could not agree if it was a tear of \\"anguish\\", \\"loneliness\\" or \\"disgust\\". Scott told the New York Post that, the affair of the heart between Lecter and Starling is \\"metaphorical\\". Rolling Stone magazine even said in their review, \\"Scott offers a sly parody of relationships‚Äîthink 'When Hannibal met Sally'.\\" =Retribution and punishment= Ridley Scott has said that he believes Lecter, in his own way, to be \\"pure\\"‚Äîone of the key motivating factors for the character is the search for \\"retribution and punishment\\". \\"There is something very moral about Lecter in this film,\\" said Scott in his audio commentary. \\"The behaviour of Hannibal is never insane‚Äî[I] didn't want to use that excuse. Is he insane? No, I think he's as sane as you or I. He just likes it.\\" Scott did say, however, \\"In our normal terms, he's truly evil.\\" Scott also brings up the notion of absolution in reference to Lecter towards the film's end. Verger has one overriding objective in life: to capture Lecter and subject him to a slow, painful death. =Corruption= Part of the story involves the character Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini), a Florentine policeman who learns \\"Dr. Fell\\"'s true identity and realizes that this knowledge could make him rich. His escalating abandonment of morality allows him to countenance and facilitate the death of a Romani pickpocket, egged on by the desire to have the best for his much younger wife. There is a moment in the film when Pazzi becomes corrupted, despite being what Scott describes as \\"very thoughtful\\". Distribution=Promotion= The first trailer appeared in theaters and was made available via the official website in early May 2000, over nine months before the film's release. As the film had only just begun production, footage was used from The Silence of the Lambs. A second trailer, which featured footage from the new film, was released in late November 2000. In marketing the film, Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter was chosen as the unique selling point of Hannibal. \\"Mr Hopkins is the draw here\\", said Elvis Mitchell in a 2001 The New York Times article. A poster released in the UK to promote Hannibal, featuring Lecter with a \\"skin mask\\" covering the right side of his face, was quickly removed from circulation as it was deemed \\"too shocking and disturbing for the public.\\" Upon its release, Hannibal was met with significant media attention, with the film's stars and director making several appearances on television, in newspapers and in magazines. In an article for CBS News, Jill Serjeant stated that \\"the long-awaited sequel to the grisly 1991 thriller Silence of the Lambs is cooking up the hottest Internet and media buzz since the 1999 Star Wars 'prequel'.\\" Stars Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore made the covers of a number of magazines, including Vanity Fair, Entertainment Weekly, Premiere and Empire. =Home media= Hannibal is available on VHS, as well as a one-disc and two-disc DVD. The two-disc DVD contains an array of special features including: commentary by director Ridley Scott, deleted and alternate scenes, five production featurettes and a \\"marketing gallery\\" which contains trailers, production stills and unused poster concepts. While the VHS version features the deleted scenes. A special \\"steel-book\\" edition of Hannibal was released in 2007. There are no significant changes made to the DVD itself; only the package artwork was changed. The film was originally released as part of The Hannibal Lecter Collection on Blu-ray in 2009. It was re-released as a stand-alone in 2011. On February 6, 2019, it was announced that the film would be released on Ultra HD Blu-ray in April. The release includes a new 4K restoration supervised by cinematographer John Mathieson, as well as all special features on the previous two-disc DVD release.https://www.blu- ray.com/news/?id=24599 Reception=Box office= Hannibal grossed $58 million (U.S.) in its opening weekend (from 3,230 screens). At the time (February 2001), this was the third-biggest debut ever‚Äîonly 1997'sThe Lost World: Jurassic Park and 1999's Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace grossed more in an opening weekend. It would be the highest opening for a horror film until September 2017 with the release of It. As of October 2012, it ranks 90th all time. It was also, when it was released, the biggest-opening box office for an R-rated film ever, until February 2004 with the release of The Passion of the Christ. Final domestic box office gross (U.S.) reached $165,092,268, with a worldwide gross of $351,692,268. The film spent three weeks at number one in the U.S. box office chart, and four weeks at number one in the UK Hannibal was the tenth highest-grossing film of the year worldwide, in a year which also saw the blockbuster releases of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Hannibal also made over $87,000,000 in U.S. video rentals following release in August 2001. =Critical response= The reviews for Hannibal were mixed. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval score of 39% based on 171 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"While superbly acted and stylishly filmed, Hannibal lacks the character interaction between the two leads which made the first movie so engrossing.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a rating of 57 out of 100 from 36 reviews. Time magazine wrote: \\"A banquet of creepy, gory or grotesque incidents is on display in Hannibal. But this superior sequel has romance in its dark heart.\\" Empire magazine gave it two out of five stars, calling it \\"laughable to just plain boring, Hannibal is toothless to the end.\\" David Thomson, writing in the British Film Institute magazine Sight & Sound, praised the film. \\"It works. It's smart, good-looking, sexy, fun ... dirty, naughty and knowing.\\" Thomson does make clear, however, he is a great fan of director Ridley Scott's work. He adds: \\"It is, literally, that Hannibal Lecter has become such a household joke that he can't be dreadful again. It seems clear that Anthony Hopkins and Scott saw that, and planned accordingly. That's how the movie was saved.\\" Variety magazine in its review said \\"Hannibal is not as good as Lambs ... ultimately more shallow and crass at its heart than its predecessor, Hannibal is nevertheless tantalizing, engrossing and occasionally startling.\\" A negative review in The Guardian claimed that what was wrong with the film was carried over from the book: \\"The result is an inflated, good-looking bore of a movie. The Silence of the Lambs was a marvelous thing. This, by contrast is barely okey-dokey.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film a \\"Thumbs down\\" rating on the television program At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper and gave the film a 2.5 out of 4 stars rating in his print review, which he began with the following: \\"Ridley Scott's Hannibal is a carnival geek show. We must give it credit for the courage of its depravity; if it proves nothing else, it proves that if a man cutting off his face and feeding it to his dogs doesn't get the NC-17 rating for violence, nothing ever will.\\" Differences from the novel According to Variety magazine, the script for Hannibal was: \\"quite faithful to the Harris blueprint; fans of the tome may regret the perhaps necessary excision of some characters, most notably Mason Verger's muscle-bound macho sister Margot, as well as the considerable fascinating academic detail, but will basically feel the book has been respected (yes, even the climactic dinner party is served up almost intact, with the only surprise twists saved for its wake).\\" Time Out noted: \\"The weight-watchers script sensibly dispenses with several characters to serve a brew that's enjoyably spicy but low on substance. So much story is squeezed into 131 minutes that little time's left for analysis or characterization.\\" Producer Dino De Laurentiis was asked why some characters, notably Jack Crawford, were left out of the film: \\"I think if you get a book which is 600 pages, you have to reduce it to a script of 100 pages. In two hours of film, you cannot possibly include all the characters. We set ourselves a limit, and cut characters which weren't so vital.\\" In the book, Mason Verger runs an orphanage, from which he calls children to verbally abuse as a substitute for his no longer being able to molest them. He also has a sister, Margot, whom he had raped when they were children and who is a lesbian. When she disclosed her sexual orientation to her family, their father disowned her. As she is sterile due to steroid abuse, Verger exerts some control over her by promising her a semen sample with which to impregnate her lover, who could then inherit the Verger fortune. At the book's end, Margot and Starling both help Lecter escape during a shootout between Starling and Verger's guards. Margot, at Lecter's advice, stimulates her brother to ejaculate with a rectally inserted cattle prod, and then kills him by ramming his pet moray eel down his throat. The book's controversial ending has Lecter presenting Starling with the exhumed bones of her father, which he \\"brings to life\\" by hypnotizing Starling, allowing her to say goodbye. This forges an odd alliance between Starling and Lecter, culminating in their becoming lovers and escaping to Argentina. At the novel's end, Barney sees them at the Teatro Col√≥n of Buenos Aires. Also gone from the film are the flashbacks to Lecter's childhood, in which he sees his younger sister, Mischa, eaten by German deserters in 1944. These flashbacks formed the basis for the 2007 film Hannibal Rising (written concurrently with the 2006 novel of the same name) which portrays Lecter as a young man. Hopkins was asked in an interview on the subject of whether or not he believed the idea of Starling and Lecter heading off into the sunset as lovers (as happens in the book). \\"Yes, I did. Other people found that preposterous. I suppose there's a moral issue there. I think it would have been a very interesting thing though. I think it would have been very interesting had she gone off, because I suspected that there was that romance, attachment there, that obsession with her. I guessed that a long time ago, at the last phone call to Clarice, at the end of SotL, she said, 'Dr. Lecter, Dr. Lecter ... '.\\" In popular culture In 2013, there was a news story from Italy where a gangster fed his rival alive to pigs. Many media stories compared this to a similar scene in Hannibal.

It is a resident breeder in Sri Lanka and peninsular India. Largely olive coloured above with whitish underparts, it has a pale supercilium and a yellow vent. They are found in dense scrub habitats, where they skulk within vegetation and can be difficult to see although their loud and distinct burst of calls is distinctive. Taxonomy and systematics=Subspecies= Two subspecies are recognized: * P. l. luteolus - (Lesson, 1841): Found in central and southern India * P. l. insulae - Whistler & Kinnear, 1932: Found in Sri Lanka Description Drinking water (Shamirpet, India) The white-browed bulbul is about long, with a moderately long () tail. It has olive-grey upperparts and whitish underparts. This species is identifiable by the white , white crescent below the eye, and dark eyestripe and moustachial stripe. The vent is yellowish and there is some yellow on the chin and moustache. The throat is however largely whitish unlike in the similar looking and sounding yellow-throated bulbul which is found in rockier habitats. Three or four hair-like s are present on the nape. Sexes are similar in plumage. It is usually detected by the burst of song that it produces from the top of a bush and often dives into the bush becoming difficult to see. The song is a rich, spluttering warble and the bird is more often heard than seen. P. l. insulae is slightly darker and has a shorter wing than the nominate race. Distribution and habitat This species is endemic to southern India and Sri Lanka. The northern boundary is along Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and western West Bengal (near Midnapur). It is found in dry open scrub country mainly on the plains and also occurs in gardens and woodlands with dense shrubbery. Behaviour and ecology A pair in a cashew tree (Goa, India) Song recorded at Bangalore, India White-browed bulbuls are usually seen singly or in pairs. They forage within bushes for fruit, nectar and insects. The breeding season is spread out from March to September and may possibly breed twice a year. Peaks in breeding occur in February and again in September. The dry season of May to July appears to be avoided for breeding in the Point Calimere region. They build a nest, a loose cup made of twigs, cobwebs and hair placed low in a thick bush and usually on the periphery. Two eggs form the typical clutch. Individuals may live for more than 11 years.

Born Catherine Donegan, she and her husband Patrick O'Leary had three children, one of whom, James Patrick O'Leary, ran a well-known Chicago saloon and gambling hall.  Great Chicago Fire 1871 illustration from Harper's Magazine depicting a shocked Mrs. O'Leary seeing her cow kicking over the lantern while she is milking. On the evening of October 8, 1871, a fire consumed the O'Leary family's barn at 137 DeKoven Street. Due to a high wind and dry conditions, it spread to burn a large percentage of the city, an event known as the Great Chicago Fire. After the Great Fire, Chicago Republican (now defunct) reporter Michael Ahern published a claim that the fire had started when a cow kicked over a lantern while it was being milked. The owner was not named, but Catherine O'Leary soon was identified because the fire had begun in her family's barn. Illustrations and caricatures soon appeared depicting Mrs. O'Leary with her cow. The idea captured the popular imagination and still is circulated widely today. However, in 1893 Ahern finally admitted he had made the story up. The official report simply states: \\"Whether it originated from a spark blown from a chimney on that windy night, or was set on fire by human agency, we are unable to determine\\". Mrs. O'Leary testified that she had been in bed when the fire began, and she had no idea what caused it. Daniel \\"Pegleg\\" Sullivan, the first person to raise the alarm, said that on seeing the barn on fire, he ran to free the animals, which included a cow owned by Sullivan's mother. He then informed the O'Learys, who were in their home and were unaware of the fire. Anti-Irish attitudes at the time encouraged making scapegoats of the O'Leary family. It was claimed that the alleged accident happened because she was drunk or that she had hidden the evidence of her guilt. Neighbors were reported to have claimed that they saw broken glass from the lamp, though all these \\"reports\\" were unverified. One man claimed he had found the damaged lamp, but it had been stolen by another Irishman to protect the O'Learys. Other rumors insisted that Daniel Sullivan had started the fire, or perhaps it was Louis M. Cohn, who claimed to have been gambling in the barn with the O'Learys' son and others. Another theory about how the fire started is that a meteor started the fire. Death and aftermath Catherine O'Leary died on July 3, 1895, of acute pneumonia at her home at 5133 Halsted Street, and was buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery. In the PBS documentary Chicago: City of the Century, a descendant of O'Leary's stated that she spent the rest of her life in the public eye, and she constantly was blamed for starting the fire. Overcome with much sadness and regret, she \\"died heartbroken.\\" The last living relative of Catherine O'Leary died in 1936. Amateur historian Richard Bales gathered sufficient evidence on Sullivan to convince the Chicago City Council to exonerate Mrs. O'Leary of any guilt in 1997. Cultural references \\"Mrs. O'Leary's cow\\" has attracted the attention and imagination of generations as the cause of the fire. Numerous references, in a variety of media, have been made in American popular culture, including: = Films = * In the 1938 film, The Mad Miss Manton, assistant Jim tells newspaper editor Peter Ames (Henry Fonda) \\"That editorial really started something!\\". Ames replies with \\"So did Mrs. O'Leary's cow!\\" * The Terrytoons animated short Mrs. O'Leary's Cow (1938) depicts the cow being brought to the witness stand in court to explain her actions. * Character actress Alice Brady won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance as Mrs. O'Leary in the film In Old Chicago (1938), in which she is portrayed as a heroic figure.

More recent work includes his involvement in the supergroup The Good, the Bad & the Queen and playing on the Gorillaz album Plastic Beach in 2010, which saw Simonon reunite with The Clash guitarist Mick Jones and Blur frontman Damon Albarn ‚Äì and which also led to Simonon becoming the live band's touring bassist for Gorillaz's Escape to Plastic Beach Tour. Early life Simonon was born in Thornton Heath, Croydon, Surrey. His father, Gustave, was an amateur artist and his mother, Elaine, was a librarian. He grew up in both the South London area of Brixton and Ladbroke Grove in West London, spending around a year in Siena and Rome, Italy with his mother and stepfather. Before joining the Clash, he had planned to become an artist. He studied at Byam Shaw School of Art (then based in Campden St, Kensington), which he attended on scholarship. Career He met Mick Jones in 1976, and six months later the Clash was formed when Joe Strummer joined, with Jones on lead guitar. Simonon learned his bass parts by rote from Jones in the early days of The Clash and still did not know how to play the bass when the group first recorded. He is credited with coming up with the name of the band and was mainly responsible for the visual aspects such as clothing and stage backdrops. Simonon was shown on the front cover of the band's double album London Calling: Pennie Smith's image of him smashing his Fender Precision Bass guitar during a 1979 concert in New York City; the image has become one of the iconic pictures of the punk era.Topping 2004, p.12.Green 2003, pp.195‚Äì196.Sweeting, Adam. \\"Death or Glory\\". Uncut. October 2004. p.70. Simonon played bass on almost all of the Clash's songs. Recordings that he did not play on include: \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" and \\"Lightning Strikes (Not Once but Twice)\\" on Sandinista! (played by Norman Watt-Roy), \\"Rock the Casbah\\" on Combat Rock (played by Topper Headon), and 10 of the 12 tracks on Cut the Crap (played by Norman Watt-Roy). Sandinista! featured bass played by Jones or Strummer, some but possibly not all of which Simonon later re-recorded once he rejoined the sessions after filming Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains. Also, when performing \\"The Guns of Brixton\\" live he switched instruments with Joe Strummer, because it was easier for him to sing while playing guitar, instead of bass as he sings lead vocals on this track. Simonon's contrapuntal reggae/ska-influenced lines set him apart from the bulk of other punk rock bassists of the era in their complexity and the role of the bass guitar within the band.Prato, Greg. [ Paul Simonon Biography]. AllMusic. Retrieved 24 February 2008. Simonon promoting the band Havana 3am in Tokyo, Japan After the Clash dissolved in 1986, Simonon started a band called Havana 3am. They recorded one album in Japan before breaking up. He also participated in a Bob Dylan session along with the Sex Pistols' Steve Jones that became part of the Dylan album Down in the Groove. Also, Simonon works as an artist ‚Äì his first passion before joining the Clash. He has had several gallery shows, and designed the cover for Big Audio Dynamite's album, Tighten Up, Vol. 88, as well as the cover for \\"Herculean\\" from the album The Good, the Bad & the Queen, a project with Damon Albarn on which Simonon plays bass. Paul reunited with Damon Albarn and Mick Jones on the Gorillaz album Plastic Beach, and was also the bassist of the Gorillaz live band supporting Plastic Beach, along with Mick Jones on guitar. The band headlined the 2010 Coachella Festival, and took up residence at the Camden roundhouse for two nights in late April 2010. In 2011, Simonon spent time aboard the Greenpeace vessel Esperanza incognito under the guise of \\"Paul the assistant cook\\" in response to Arctic oil drilling in Greenland by Cairn Oil. He joined other Greenpeace activists in illegally boarding one of Cairn's oil rigs; an action which earned him two weeks in a Greenland jail. His identity was revealed to other crew members after the voyage, and he joined Damon Albarn and the other members of the Good, the Bad & the Queen for a performance in London celebrating Greenpeace's 40th anniversary. Actor Pete Morrow portrays Simonon in the 2016 film London Town. The film was met with mixed reviews.

It was the home of the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association (NBA), the Detroit Shock of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), the Detroit Vipers of the International Hockey League, the Detroit Rockers of the National Professional Soccer League, the Detroit Neon/Detroit Safari of the Continental Indoor Soccer League, and the Detroit Fury of the Arena Football League. The Palace was one of eight basketball arenas owned by their respective NBA franchises. Naming By the time it closed as an NBA venue, the Palace was one of only two arenas which had not sold its naming rights to a corporate sponsor. The other was Madison Square Garden. The court was previously named the \\"William Davidson Court\\", in honor of late owner Bill Davidson, prior to the Pistons' home opener on October 30, 2009; however, Davidson's signature, along with the retired numbers, were removed from the hardwood when Tom Gores took over ownership of the Palace, and were instead re-retired atop the Palace rafters as replacement banners. History The interior of the Palace of Auburn Hills during a Detroit Pistons basketball game in January 2006. =Background= From 1957 to 1978, the Pistons competed in Detroit's Olympia Stadium, Memorial Building, and Cobo Arena. In 1978, owner Bill Davidson elected not to share the new Joe Louis Arena with the Detroit Red Wings, and instead chose to relocate the team to the Pontiac Silverdome, a venue constructed for football, where they remained for the next decade. While the Silverdome could accommodate massive crowds, it offered substandard sight lines for basketball viewing. In late 1985, a group led by Davidson decided to build a new arena in Auburn Hills. Groundbreaking for the arena took place in June 1986. Using entirely private funding, The Palace cost a relatively low price of $90 million. The Davidson family held a controlling interest in the arena until Tom Gores bought it as part of his purchase of the Pistons in 2011. =Construction= Then-Pistons owner Bill Davidson and two developers privately financed the $90 million construction of The Palace, and did not require public funds. The Palace was built with 180 luxury suites, considered an exorbitant number when it opened. However, it consistently managed to lease virtually all of them. In December 2005, the Palace added five underground luxury suites, each containing of space and renting for $450,000 per year. Eight more luxury suites, also located below arena level, were opened in February 2006. They range in size from and rent for $350,000 annually. The architectural design of the Palace, including its multiple tiers of luxury suites, has been used as the basis for many other arenas in North America since its construction. =Basketball= The Palace opened in 1988. When one of its basketball occupants won a championship, the number on its address changed. Its address was 6 Championship Drive, reflecting the Pistons' three NBA titles and the Shock's three WNBA titles (the Vipers' 1997 Turner Cup championship was not officially recognized in the arena's address; the address also remained unchanged despite the Shock's move to Tulsa, Oklahoma in 2010; that team is now known as the Dallas Wings). The Palace was widely considered to be the first of the modern-style NBA arenas, and its large number of luxury suites was a major reason for the building boom of new NBA arenas in the 1990s. Although the Palace became one of the oldest arenas in the NBA, its foresighted design contained the amenities that most NBA teams have sought in new arenas built since that time. By contrast, of the other NBA venues that opened during the 1988-89 season, Charlotte Coliseum, Miami Arena, the Bradley Center and Sleep Train Arena were considered obsolete relatively quickly, due to a lack of luxury suites and club seating, lucrative revenue-generating features that made pro sports teams financially successful in order to remain competitive long-term. Nonetheless, Palace Sports & Entertainment (PS&E;) had spent $117.5 million in upgrades and renovations to keep the arena updated. A new high definition JumboTron monitor, new LED video monitors, and more than of ribbon display technology from Daktronics was installed in the mid-2000s. Malice at the Palace On November 19, 2004, a fight broke out between members of the Pistons and Indiana Pacers. As the on-court fight died down, a fan threw a cup of Diet Coke at Pacers forward Ron Artest, who then rushed into the crowd, sparking a melee between players and spectators. The fight resulted in the suspension of nine players, criminal charges against five players, and criminal charges against five spectators. The offending fans were banned from attending games at the Palace. In the aftermath of the fight, the NBA decided to increase the security presence between players and spectators. The fact that the fight took place at the Palace led to it becoming colloquially referred to as the \\"Malice at the Palace\\" and the \\"Basketbrawl\\". The Palace was also the site of a brawl between the WNBA's Shock and Sparks on July 22, 2008. =Notable concerts= The Palace at night Sting performed during his ...Nothing Like the Sun Tour on August 13, 1988, becoming the very first musical act to perform at The Palace. Pink Floyd performed there on August 16‚Äì17, 1988 as part of their A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour. Michael Jackson performed three sold-out shows during his Bad World Tour on October 24‚Äì26, 1988. Janet Jackson performed two shows there on August 22‚Äì23, 1990 as part of her Rhythm Nation World Tour. Additionally, Jackson also performed there on July 30‚Äì31, 2001 during her All for You Tour. Aerosmith played the venue 14 times from 1990‚Äì2012. Van Halen performed four shows on their For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge Tour on February 21‚Äì22, 1992 and on April 3‚Äì4, 1992. They also performed consecutive shows during their The Balance \\"Ambulance\\" Tour on April 15‚Äì16, 1995. U2 performed at The Palace on March 27, 1992 on the first leg of their Zoo TV Tour. During the performance, Bono called a local pizza bar from the stage and ordered 10,000 pizzas for the crowd in attendance. Approximately 100 pizzas were delivered.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eY59Bxlikk The Cure performed two consecutive shows, during their Wish Tour on July 18‚Äì19, 1992, with The Cranes as their opening act. The shows were recorded and released as a live album, entitled Show. Bon Jovi performed during their Keep The Faith world tour on March 2, 1993, their Crush Tour on November 18, 2000 and their Lost Highway Tour on February 20 and July 7, 2008. The Palace was the site of an attempt on the life of Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, while he was on tour, with former bandmate Robert Plant, during their No Quarter Tour. On March 31, 1995, Lance Alworth Cunningham, a 23-year-old who thought that Led Zeppelin's music contained \\"satanic messages\\", tried to rush the stage with a knife. He was subdued about 50 feet from the stage. Grand Funk Railroad performed a benefit show for the nation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in March 1997 during their Reunion Tour. The show also featured Peter Frampton, Alto Reed, Paul Shaffer, and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. The performance was recorded, and released as the double-live Bosnia album in October of that year. Phish played at the Palace during their fall 1997 tour on December 6, 1997. This show is known as one of their funkiest performances of all time and includes funky versions of their songs Run Like an Antelope, Tweezer, and Izabella (Jimi Hendrix cover), among others. Madonna performed two sold-out shows during her Drowned World Tour on August 25‚Äì26, 2001. The shows were recorded and broadcast live on HBO and were later released as a DVD, entitled Drowned World Tour 2001. Prince brought his Musicology Live 2004ever tour to the Palace on June 20‚Äì21, 2004. He returned to the venue on July 31. =Replacement and demolition= In October 2016, it was reported that the Pistons' ownership were negotiating a possible relocation to Little Caesars Arena, a new multi-purpose venue then under construction in Midtown Detroit, for 2017‚Äì18 season. Little Caesars Arena was initially designed for ice hockey to replace Joe Louis Arena as home of the National Hockey League's Detroit Red Wings, so some design modifications were needed to accommodate the Pistons. On November 22, 2016, the team officially announced that they would play at Little Caesars Arena in 2017. The final NBA game at The Palace was played on April 10, 2017, with the Pistons losing to the Washington Wizards, 105‚Äì101. This game ended a 42-year history of professional sports in Oakland County. Bob Seger held the final concert at the venue on September 23, 2017. The last scheduled event at the venue was the Taste of Auburn Hills on October 12, 2017. Palace Sports & Entertainment entered into a joint venture with Olympia Entertainment known as 313 Presents to jointly manage entertainment bookings and promotions for Little Caesars Arena and other venues owned by the firms. Despite its closure, the Palace was still in top condition as a sporting and concert venue. However, it was located in a northern suburb, relatively far away from the city center, in light of the growing trend of \\"walkable urbanism\\" where the Pistons wanted to grow their fanbase. It was speculated that the Palace would likely end up being demolished, and the site would be redeveloped to accommodate a possible new auto supplier headquarters and research and development parks. In August 2018, the arena's Palace360 scoreboard, installed in 2014, was sold to the Arizona Coyotes of the NHL to replace the old one at Gila River Arena in time for the 2018‚Äì19 season. In October 2018, it was reported Oakland University considered purchasing the arena. Ultimately, a deal never went through. On June 24, 2019, the arena was sold to a joint venture which planned to redevelop the property into a mixed-use office park. Demolition of the arena began in February 2020. Demolition was completed on July 11, 2020 when the roof was demolished using explosives by Controlled Demolition, Inc.

BMD stands for Boyevaya Mashina Desanta (–ë–æ–µ–≤–∞—è –ú–∞—à–∏–Ω–∞ –î–µ—Å–∞–Ω—Ç–∞, which literally translates to \\"Combat Vehicle of the Airborne\\").. Retrieved 20 September 2011. It can be dropped by parachute and although it resembles the BMP-1 it is in fact much smaller. The BMD-1 was used as an IFV by the Soviet Army's airborne divisions. An improved variant of the BMD-1 was developed, the BMD-2. The BMD-1 also provided a basis for the BTR-D airborne multi-purpose tracked APC. Development In the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the army was instructed to consider putting more emphasis on means to project power outside of the normal sphere of Soviet influence. As a result, there was a major effort to develop the VDV (Soviet airborne forces) as a rapid deployment force. Soviet studies of airborne operations had shown that lightly armed paratroops were unable to deal with armoured forces. Also, in the early 1960s, the BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicle was being developed. Before the BMP-1 entered service in 1966, the Soviet Army high command decided to equip the newly created airborne divisions with similar vehicles. The use of Antonov An-12 aircraft at the time of the BMD development allowed the transport of only light armoured vehicles for an airborne drop that weighed less than seven tons. Because the existing BMP-1 weighed 13 tonnes, it was effectively ruled out of being considered for the VDV service. The task of designing the BMD fell to the Volgograd Tractor Factory, which had produced an unsuccessful competitor to the Ob'yekt 764 that eventually became the BMP-1 ‚Äì the Ob'yekt 914. The BMD design, Ob'yekt 915, was basically a trimmed down version of the Ob'yekt 914 ‚Äì smaller, lighter aluminium armour, while retaining the 73 mm 2A28 \\"Grom\\" low pressure smoothbore short-recoil semi-automatic gun. The compromise made is the extremely cramped crew compartment. Development started in 1965 and trials began in 1967. A limited production began in 1968. After operational trials, it was commissioned on 14 April 1969 and serial production started in 1970, although the vehicle weighed 500 kg more than what the requirements stated (7.5 tonnes and 13.3 tonnes when loaded with equipment). Starting from 1977 a new modernized vehicle received a designation BMD-1P following adoption of the new 9P135M-1 ATGM launcher instead of 9S428 ATGM launcher, firing the 9M113 Konkurs (AT-5 Spandrel) and 9M111M Fagot or 9M111-2 (standard load: two 9M113 and one 9M111M missiles). Most of older BMD-1s were subsequently modernized this way. In 1983, based on the combat experience in Afghanistan, a decision was made to produce a new variant of the BMD with a weapon capable of engaging targets such as those faced by the airborne troops in that conflict. This resulted in \\"Ob'yekt 916\\", which later became the BMD-2. A lengthened BMD-1 chassis served as the basis for the BTR-D airborne multi-purpose tracked APC, which itself served as a basis for many specialized airborne vehicles. Description BMD-1 three-view graphic. =Overview= The BMD-1 can be thought of as a BMP intended for airborne troops. The vehicle therefore must be lighter and smaller in order to meet airdrop weight requirements (the BMD-1 is secured to a pallet and parachute-dropped from cargo planes). The BMD-1 has an unconventional layout for an IFV. From the front to the back of the vehicle, the compartments are located in the following formation: steering, fighting, troop and engine. This is because the BMD-1 is based on Ob'yekt 914, which in turn is based on the PT-76 amphibious light tank (refer Prototypes section in the BMP-1 article for details). This meant that transported troops had to mount and dismount the vehicle via the roof hatches, which made them an easy target on the battlefield when these actions were performed. =Crew= The crew consist of four soldiers: driver, commander, gunner and bow machine gunner, two of which (commander and machine gunner) are included in the number of soldiers carried. The driver's station is located centrally in the front of the vehicle and has a hatch that is opened by raising it and rotating it to the right. The driver is provided with three periscope vision blocks, which allow him to view the outer environment when his hatch is closed. The center one can be replaced with a night vision device for use in night and bad visibility conditions or with an extended periscope for swimming with the trim vane erected. The commander's station is on the driver's left. It is provided with a hatch, one periscope vision block, an outer environment observation device and an R-123 radio set for communications. He also fires the left bow machine gun. The right one is operated by a bow machine gun gunner, who sits to the right of the driver. The gunner's station is located on the left side of the turret, like in the BMP-1, and has the same equipment (see Gunner's station section in BMP-1 article for details). =Turret= The BMD-1 has the same turret as the BMP-1. =Armament= The vehicle is armed with a 73 mm 2A28 Grom gun and a 7.62 mm PKT coaxial tank machine gun. Mounted on the mantlet is the 9S428 ATGM launcher capable of firing 9M14 Malyutka (NATO: AT-3A Sagger A) and 9M14M Malyutka-M (NATO: AT-3B Sagger B) ATGMs (for which the vehicle carries two ATGMs in the turret). There are also two 7.62 mm PKT machine guns in fixed mounts, one in each corner of the bow. =Mobility=Maneuverability The vehicle is powered by a 5D-20 6-cylinder 4-stroke V-shaped liquid-cooled 15.9-liter diesel engine, which develops 270 hp (201 kW) at 2,600 revolutions per minute. The engine drives a manual gearbox with five forward and one reverse gear. The BMD-1 has a maximum road speed of 80 kilometers per hour, reducing to around 45 kilometers per hour off-road and 10 kilometers per hour while swimming. The BMD-1 can climb vertical obstacles, cross trenches and 30% side slopes. It can climb 60% gradients. The BMD-1 has a ground pressure of 0.57 kg/cm¬≤. The 230 mm wide track is driven at the rear and passes over five small evenly spaced road wheels suspended on independent torsion bars. On each side there is an idler wheel at the front, a rear drive sprocket and four track-return rollers. The independent suspension combines a hydraulic system for altering the ground clearance and maintaining the track tension with pneumatic springs, which enables the ground clearance to be altered from 100 mm to 450 mm. Alterable ground clearance allows easier transportation in an airplane. Amphibious ability The BMD-1 is fully amphibious, it can swim after switching on the two electric bilge pumps, erecting the two-piece trim vane which improves vehicle's stability and displacement in water and prevents the water from flooding the bow of the tank and switching the driver's periscope for a swimming periscope that enables the driver to see over the trim vane. When not in use the trim vane is placed in its laying position in the front of the bow under the barrel of the main gun and serves as additional armour. There is also a manual bilge pump for emergency use. The bilge pumps keep the vehicle afloat even if it is hit, damaged or leaks. In water it is propelled by two hydrojets, one in each side of the hull, with the entrance under the hull and exits at the rear of the hull. The rear exits have lids that can be fully or partially closed, redirecting the water stream to the forward-directed exits at the sides of the hull, thus enabling the vehicle to turn or float reverse, for example, to go left, the left water-jet is covered, to go right, the right water-jet is covered and to make a 180¬∞ turn the left water-jet sucks in water and the right water-jet pushes it out. Air-drop techniques The vehicle can be transported by An-12, An-22, Il-76, An-124 airplanes and Mi-6 and Mi-26 helicopters. The BMD was originally dropped under the MKS-350-9 multi-canopy parachute with a descending speed between 15 m/s and 20 m/s.Pancerni.net BMD-2 2 . Pancerni.abajt.pl. Retrieved 20 September 2011. The intention was to drop the vehicle without the crew. This proved to be very problematic, since the crew frequently landed at a considerable distance from the vehicle and often had trouble finding it. Also, the vehicle itself could easily land in a location from which it couldn't be extracted (either because of a lack of suitable equipment or because of the location being virtually inaccessible). Several experiments were done in the 1970s in order to find a way to circumvent these limitations, including dropping the BMD with the two key crew members, the driver and gunner, seated inside the vehicle during the descent. The first such test took place in January 1973, and the concept was proved to be valid in a subsequent series of tests. A rocket parachute, the PRSM-915, was developed to ensure the vehicle's safe landing. To use the parachute, the BMD is first packed onto a special pallet before takeoff. To drop the BMD, a drogue chute is released that initially drags the BMD out of the Il-76 transport plane. Once clear of the plane a single large main chute opens. The deployment of the main chute triggers the deployment of four long rods which hang beneath the pallet. As soon as the rods touch the ground a retrorocket fires, slowing the BMD to a descending speed between 6 m/s and 7 m/s and giving it a relatively soft landing.. This system entered service in 1975 and allows a BMD to be relatively safely parachuted with both the driver and the gunner. An alternative radio location system also exists. Each crew member is given a radio receiver locked onto a transponder in its particular BMD, allowing each BMD crewman to quickly locate his respective vehicle after the airdrop. =Armour protection= The BMD-1's armour is made of ABT-101 an alloy composed of 91% Aluminum, 6% Zinc and 3% Magnesium. The BMD-2 on the other- hand is composed of ABT-102, which 94% Aluminum, 4% Zinc and 2% Magnesium. Armour thickness is 23 mm at 42¬∞ on the front of the turret, 19 mm at 36¬∞ on the sides of the turret, 13 mm at 30¬∞ on the rear of the turret, 6 mm on the top of the turret, 15 mm on the front of the hull and 10 mm on the rest of the hull. The hull's front armour has two sections: upper and lower. The upper section is angled at 78¬∞ while the lower one is angled at 50¬∞. It is resistant to small arms fire and shrapnel. =Troop compartment= Many compromises had to be made to the design in order to save the necessary weight, not least to crew comfort. The BMD-1 has an extremely cramped interior space, which is much smaller than that found in the BMP-1 and BMP-2 IFVs. It can carry five infantrymen, comprising vehicle's commander, bow machine gunner and three soldiers seated behind a turret. Nevertheless, it is equipped with periscope vision blocks on the sides and rear of the vehicle. There are only three firing ports, one on each side of the hull and one in the rear. As standard, the vehicle carries the following weapons inside the troop compartment: an RPG-7 or RPG-16 shoulder-launched anti-tank rocket propelled grenade launcher, which is to be operated by two soldiers, RPKS light machine gun and five AKMS assault rifles. It also carries portable launchers for 9M14M Malyutka missiles (9M111/9M113 missiles in BMD-1P). =Equipment= The vehicle has electric and manual bilge pumps, Gpk-S9 gyro-compass, engine pre-heater, TDA smoke- generating equipment, FTP-100M NBC system, R-123 transceiver, R-124 intercom and a centralized methyl bromide fire extinguishing system, the same as the one fitted to other former Soviet armoured vehicles. Service history The BMD-1 entered serial production in 1968. It was produced by Volgograd Tractor Plant. Two airborne regiments of each airborne division were equipped with BMD-1 IFVs. Overall, each division operated 220 BMD-1 IFVs. It was displayed publicly for the first time during the Dvina exercise in the USSR in 1970. The BMD-1 was showcased for the second time during the Moscow Red Square parade in November 1973. Western governments originally classified the BMD-1 as a light tank before its true nature was known. Because of its small crew, the introduction of the BMD led to a reduction in the number of soldiers in an airborne battalion, from 610 to 316 men. The firepower of the BMD also meant that some of the battalion's integral fire support could be done away with. In 1973, the BMD-1 completely replaced the ASU-57 airborne assault guns in the Soviet airborne forces, increasing the firepower and maneuverability of the airborne division. Since 1977 a number of Soviet BMD-1 IFVs underwent a modernization to BMD-1P standard. Soldiers ride on top of a BMD-1 in Kabul, Afghanistan, 25 March 1986. =Ogaden War= In 1978, a force of 70 Cuban Army BMD-1s and ASU-57s fighting on behalf of the Ethiopian government was airlifted by Mi-6 helicopters behind the lines of Somali forces holding the town of Jijiiga. This attack formed a pincer with a conventional Cuban armored push and routed the Somali forces in Ogaden. =Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War= It was widely used by airborne units during Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. During the initial Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, BMD-1s of the Soviet 103rd Guards Airborne Division and 345th Separate Parachute Regiment were airlanded by IL-76 transports into Kabul airport and Bagram Airfield, enabling the rapid seizure of critical cities and facilities throughout Afghanistan. The 56th Air Assault Brigade executed a similar capture of Kunduz. For the remainder of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan through 1989, airborne forces under the 40th Army used BMD-1s as infantry fighting vehicles for transportation and fire support in operations against the mujahideen. BMD-1 IFVs were not suited for fighting in the hot mountain regions of Afghanistan, as they were originally developed to provide airborne units with an IFV to give them a chance in engagements with enemy armour and allow them to operate in Nuclear-Biological- Chemical (NBC) warfare conditions. In Afghanistan, the main enemies were not AFVs but land mines and ambushes prepared by skillful Afghan Mujahideen armed with light anti-tank weapons, which meant that the BMD-1's anti-tank firepower was useless. Many BMD-1 IFVs fell victim to Mujahideen attacks and, especially, antitank landmines like quite a lot of Soviet light AFVs sent there. The Soviet Army lost 1,317 APCs and IFVs of all types during nine years of war in Afghanistan. A destroyed Iraqi BMD-1 IFV sits near an abandoned structure in Northern Iraq, during Operation Iraqi Freedom, 2 April 2003. =Iraq= In 1990, BMD-1 IFVs were used by the Iraqi Army during the First Gulf War. They were used for a second time during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. =Former Yugoslavia= BMD-1 and BMD-1PK IFVs are used by the Russian airborne units in KFOR. BMD-1 IFVs were used by Russian airborne units in SFOR. =2008 Georgia‚ÄìRussia War= During the Russo-Georgian War, BMD-1s of the 104th Airborne Assault Regiment of the 76th Guards Air Assault Division advanced into South Ossetia and successfully engaged Georgian Army troops and vehicles. However, the BMDs visual and sighting equipment was criticized as being primitive.Anatoly Tsiganok, \\"Assessing the Campaign in the South Caucasus,\\" Nezavisimoye Voyennoye Obozreniye, 19 September 2008. =2014 Ukraine Donbass Conflict= During the War in Donbass in 2014 in Eastern Ukraine, BMD-1s were used both by mechanized units of the Ukrainian Army and in smaller number by the separatists of the Donetsk People's Republic. It was claimed that a BMD-1 was one of the six armored vehicles in Separatist forces defending Sloviansk when it was besieged.–°—Ç—Ä—î–ª–∫–æ–≤: \\"–û–ø–æ–ª—á–µ–Ω—Ü—ñ\\" –≤–±–∏–≤–∞—Ç–∏–º—É—Ç—å —É–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∏—Ö –≤—ñ–π—Å—å–∫–æ–≤–∏—Ö, —è–∫—â–æ —Ç—ñ –Ω–∞–¥–∞–ª—ñ –≤–∏–∫–æ–Ω—É–≤–∞—Ç–∏–º—É—Ç—å —Å–≤–æ—ó –æ–±–æ–≤'—è–∑–∫–∏.

This very lightweight wheeled armoured personnel carrier that incorporates plastic and carbon fibre in its construction, as well as aluminum. The GAZ-3937 can be air-dropped like the BMD, but is considerably lighter and less expensive to manufacture. Since the GAZ-3937 lacks the armor protection, cross-country mobility, and heavy armament of the BMD series, and is armed only with a 7.62 mm PKM machine gun in front of the commander's hatch, the BMD-4 (an upgraded BMD-3) has been selected for the future use of the Russian airborne and naval infantry. The BMD-4 uses the same 100 mm main gun with 30 mm autocannon and 7.62 mm medium machine gun turret on an improved, larger hull raising overall weight to the 15-ton class. The waterjet swim propulsion systems of the BMD-3/4 are strong enough to enable ship-to-shore transport, resulting in Russian naval infantry use.

Michael Hogan. 2011. Celtic Sea. eds. P. Saundry & C. Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the /environment. Washington DC. other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea. History The Celtic Sea receives its name from the Celtic heritage of the bounding lands to the north and east. The name was first proposed by E. W. L. Holt at a 1921 meeting in Dublin of fisheries experts from Great Britain, France, and Ireland. The northern portion of this sea was considered as part of Saint George's Channel and the southern portion as an undifferentiated part of the \\"Southwest Approaches\\" to Great Britain. The desire for a common name came to be felt because of the common marine biology, geology and hydrology of the area. It was adopted in France before being common in the English-speaking countries; in 1957 √âdouard Le Danois wrote, \\"the name Celtic Sea is hardly known even to oceanographers.\\" It was adopted by marine biologists and oceanographers, and later by petroleum exploration firms. It is named in a 1963 British atlas,; cited in but a 1972 article states \\"what British maps call the Western Approaches, and what the oil industry calls the Celtic Sea [...] certainly the residents on the western coast [of Great Britain] don't refer to it as such.\\" Limits Map of Sea Areas referred to in the Shipping Forecast; Lundy is in the Celtic Sea. There are no land features to divide the Celtic Sea from the open Atlantic Ocean to the south and west. For these limits, Holt suggested the marine contour and the island of Ushant off the tip of Brittany. The definition approved by 1974 by the UK Hydrographer of the Navy for use in Admiralty Charts was \\"bounded roughly by lines joining Ushant, Land's End, Hartland Point, Lundy Island, St. Govan's Head and Rosslare, thence following the Irish coast south to Mizen Head and then along the 200-metre isobath to approximately the latitude of Ushant.\\" The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Celtic Sea as follows: > On the North. The Southern limit of the Irish Sea [a line joining St David's > Head to Carnsore Point], the South coast of Ireland, thence from Mizen Head > a line drawn to a position . On the West and South. A line from the position > South to 49¬∞N, thence to latitude 46¬∞30'N on the Western limit of the Bay of > Biscay [a line joining Cape Ortegal to Penmarch Point], thence along that > line to Penmarch Point. On the East. The Western limit of the English > Channel [a line joining √éle Vierge to Land's End] and the Western limit of > the Bristol Channel [a line joining Hartland Point to St. Govan's Head]. Seabed The seabed under the Celtic Sea is referred to as the Celtic Shelf, part of the continental shelf of Europe. The northeast portion has a depth of between , increasing towards Saint George's Channel. In the opposite direction, sand ridges pointing southwest have a similar height, separated by troughs approximately deeper. These ridges were formed by tidal effects when the sea level was lower. South of 50¬∞N the topography is more irregular. Oil and gas exploration in the Celtic Sea has had limited commercial success. The Kinsale Head gas field supplied much of the Republic of Ireland in the 1980s and 1990s. The water is too deep for fixed wind turbines. The area has potential for 50 GW of floating wind farms, and Total S.A. plans a project with almost 100 MW. Ecology of the Celtic Sea The Celtic Sea has a rich fishery with total annual catches of 1.8 million tonnes as of 2007. Four cetacean species occur frequently in the area: minke whale, bottlenose dolphin, short-beaked common dolphin and harbor porpoise. Formerly, it held an abundance of marine mammals.

Carpe diem) is a comic fantasy novel by English writer Terry Pratchett, the twenty-third in the Discworld series. It was first published in 1998. In Carpe Jugulum, Terry Pratchett pastiches the traditions of vampire literature, playing with the mythic archetypes and featuring a tongue-in-cheek reversal of 'vampyre' subculture with young vampires who wear bright clothes, drink wine, and stay up until noon. Plot summary Count Magpyr and family, vampires from √úberwald, are invited to the naming of Magrat and King Verence's daughter, to be conducted by the Omnian priest, Mightily Oats. During the party after the ceremony, Verence tells Nanny Ogg and Agnes Nitt that the Count has informed him that the Magpyr family intend to move into Lancre Castle and take over. Due to a type of hypnotism, everyone seems to consider this plan to be perfectly acceptable. Only the youngest witch, Agnes, and the Omnian priest, Mightily Oats, seem able to resist the vampiric mind control, due to their dual personalities. Because of her ability to resist his influence, the Magpyr son, Vlad, is attracted to Agnes and makes many advances on her including trying to convince her to become a vampire. Meanwhile, Granny Weatherwax, feeling slighted by not receiving an invitation to the ceremony, has left her cottage empty and seems to be working towards a life in a cave, almost like a hermit. After they have left the hypnotic influence of the Vampires, Agnes, Nanny Ogg and Magrat attempt to convince her to help them save Lancre, but apparently without success, even after Granny is informed that her invitation was stolen by a magpie. The three witches return to Lancre to take on the Count and his family without her, but because the Magpyr family have built up a tolerance for the normal methods of defeating a vampire, such as garlic, bright light, and religious symbols, this is not so easily done. Just when it seems all is lost, Granny Weatherwax comes through the front door, soaked to the bone and swaying with exhaustion. Nanny Ogg and Magrat use Granny's assault upon the Count as a distraction to escape, leaving Granny, Agnes and Brother Oats with the Vampires. Granny is unable to get through the Count's mental defenses, and the Magpyrs feed on her, with the intention of transforming her into a vampire. There is an Igor who is the servant of the Magpyrs. He is a traditionalist who spends his spare time breeding and distributing spiders for the dark corners of the castle. The Magpyrs hate him and his \\"more gothic than thou\\" attitude, as Igor tries to keep the old ways alive. Igor's impression of the current Count Magpyr is that he is too modern, whereas Igor prefers \\"tradithionalitht\\" methods of Vampirism, (all Igors have a lisp on the Discworld‚Äîalthough some only have it when they remember). Nanny Ogg, Magrat, and Magrat's infant daughter, Esmerelda Margaret Note Spelling of Lancre, escape with the help of the rebelling Igor (who appears to have a crush on Nanny), but are forced to detour to √úberwald and end up in the Magpyrs' castle. Agnes is kidnapped by the Magpyrs' son and their clan, who give chase by flying. Granny Weatherwax struggles against the vampirism inside her and thrusts the pain this causes into the iron of the castle forge's anvil. She is only able to defeat the vampirism after she looks inside herself and faces the darker side of her nature, but the struggle leaves her barely able to stand, let alone defeat the Count. While Magrat and her daughter hide in Igor's dungeon quarters, Nanny and Igor begin fighting against the Magpyrs, using the considerable stock of Holy water and other religious symbols that were originally collected by old Count Magpyr (who is described as having been \\"a sportsman\\"). Surprisingly (for the Magpyr family, at least), the old- fashioned ways to defeat vampires that they thought themselves protected against start to work again. They don't understand what the problem is, although they start to have bizarre cravings for \\"hot, sweet strong tea and biscuits\\", a combination that has them feeling quite upset (it not being their usual craving for blood). All is revealed when Granny (who has \\"helped\\" Mightily Oats to √úberwald by being carried by him), tells them that - far from turning her into a Vampire - they have, instead, been 'Weatherwaxed'; she had magically \\"Borrowed\\" her own blood, which they drank, allowing her past their mental defences. The Magpyrs find themselves unable to harm Magrat's daughter, or do anything else that Granny herself is unable to do (e.g. fly). They are even more horrified when they find out that Igor has re-awakened the old Count Magpyr (having gone into his crypt and spilled a drop of blood on the old Count's cremation ashes), and that the people of √úberwald would prefer the old Count to their new, modern type of vampirism. Oats gives the new Count a mortal wound across the neck with an axe (though for vampires, mortal wounds aren't necessarily the end), and the old Count is left to teach the two young Magpyrs (Lacrimosa and Vlad) the \\"old ways.\\" The three vampires are last seen turning into a flock of magpies and disappearing into the darkness of the castle roof. The witches head home to Lancre.

It is a variant of BMD-1 with a new turret and some changes done to the hull. BMD stands for Boyevaya Mashina Desanta (–ë–æ–µ–≤–∞—è –ú–∞—à–∏–Ω–∞ –î–µ—Å–∞–Ω—Ç–∞, which literally translates to \\"Airborne Combat Vehicle\\"). It was developed as a replacement of BMD-1 but it failed to replace it completely because of the downfall of Soviet economy in 1980s. NATO gave it the designation BMD M1981/1. Development When the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War broke out, the Soviet forces operated BMP-1 IFVs and BMD-1 airborne IFVs. They were both armed with 73 mm 2A28 \\"Grom\\" low pressure smoothbore short-recoil semi-automatic gun, 9S428 ATGM launcher capable of firing 9M14 \\"Malyutka\\" (NATO: AT-3A Sagger A), 9M14M \\"Malyutka-M\\" (NATO: AT-3B Sagger B) and 9M14P \\"Malyutka-P\\" (NATO: AT-3C Sagger C) ATGMs and 7.62 mm PKT coaxial tank machine gun. Although their armament made for strong anti-tank firepower, it didn't provide sufficient firepower against enemy unarmored vehicles, infantry, firing points and light fortified positions, especially during mountain battles because of low elevation angle of the main gun. In 1981 the units fighting in Afghanistan started receiving new BMP-2 IFVs. Its 30 mm 2A42 multi-purpose autocannon with two-belt loading system and very high elevation angle solved some of the serious drawbacks of the 73 mm 2A28 \\"Grom\\" gun. Also the 9S428 ATGM launcher was replaced by pintle-mounted 9P135M-1 ATGM launcher with semi-automatic control capable of firing SACLOS guided 9M113 \\"Konkurs\\" (AT-5 Spandrel), 9M113M \\"Konkurs-M\\" (AT-5B Spandrel B), 9M111 \\"Fagot\\" (AT-4 Spigot) and 9M111-2 \\"Fagot\\" (AT-4B Spigot B) ATGMs which proved to be much more effective and reliable than the MCLOS guided 9M14 \\"Malyutka\\" (AT-3 Sagger), 9M14M \\"Malyutka-M\\" (AT-3B Sagger B) and 9M14P \\"Malyutka-P\\" (AT-3C Sagger C) ATGMs. Because of that the high command of Soviet airborne forces decided to arm their units with similar vehicles. In the beginning it became obvious that the hull of BMD-1 was too small for the BMP-2 turret. Therefore, it was decided to design two vehicles. The first one was supposed to satisfy the immediate need of a new airborne IFV by modifying the BMD-1/BMP-1 turret, arming it with the same armament as the one on the BMP-2 and then fitting it onto the BMD-1 hull. The second vehicle was supposed to be much bigger to allow fitting of the BMP-2 turret and later became the BMD-3. The modernized variant of BMD-1 was developed in 1983 and incorporated the new B-30 turret armed with 30 mm 2A42 multi-purpose autocannon, 7.62 mm PKT coaxial tank machine gun and pintle-mounted 9P135M-1 ATGM launcher. After it passed the trials it entered production in 1985. Description=Overview= BMD-2 has a slightly modernized BMD-1 hull and a new turret. =Crew= The BMD-2's crew is the same as the one in BMD-1 with slight changes like the fact that the commander no longer operates the left bow-mounted 7.62 mm PKT tank machine gun which was removed because the trials proved that he is too consumed by his primary duties to accurately fire it. He also received the R-123M radio set for communication. The new turret seats the gunner on the left hand side of the main gun. On top of the turret there's one single piece circular hatch opening to the front. Located in front of the said hatch is the gunner's sight which is the same one as the one used in BMP-2. Another gunner's sight is located on the left hand side of the main gun and moves in vertical planes along with it. It is a high angle of fire sight used when the gunner is aiming at air targets. The vehicle also has additional periscopes that provide it with vision on the sides. A white searchlight is mounted in front of the turret. =Turret= The B-30 turret is a modified version of the BMP-1/BMD-1 turret. =Armament= BMD-2 of the 106th Guards Airborne Division The vehicle is armed with stabilized 30 mm 2A42 multi- purpose autocannon and 7.62 mm PKT coaxial tank machine gun (mounted on the right hand side of the main gun). The vehicle carries 300 rounds for the main gun (180 AP and 120 HE) and 2,940 rounds for the machine gun. The main gun can be elevated or depressed between 75¬∞ and -5¬∞ and can be used to fire at air targets. The turret is also armed with pintle-mounted 9P135M-1 ATGM launcher, on the right hand side of the roof of the turret, with semi-automatic control capable of firing SACLOS guided 9M113 \\"Konkurs\\" (AT-5 Spandrel), 9M113M \\"Konkurs-M\\" (AT-5B Spandrel B), 9M111 \\"Fagot\\" (AT-4 Spigot) and 9M111-2 \\"Fagot\\" (AT-4B Spigot B) ATGMs. =Maneuverability= The BMD-2 has the same engine and same suspension as the BMD-1 but it has a maximum road operational range of 450 km. =Air-drop techniques= BMD-2 after landing The vehicle can be transported by An-12, An-22, Il-76, An-124 airplanes and Mi-6 and Mi-26 helicopters. A rocket parachute, the PRSM-915, was developed to ensure the vehicle's safe landing.\\"Test of PRSM-925 parachute with retrorocket\\". Retrieved 4 March 2014. To use the parachute, the BMD is first packed onto a special pallet before takeoff. To drop the BMD, a drogue chute is released that initially drags the BMD out of the Il-76 transport plane. Once clear of the plane a single large main chute opens. The deployment of the main chute triggers the deployment of four long rods which hang beneath the pallet. As soon as the rods touch the ground a retrorocket fires, slowing the BMD to a descending speed between 6 m/s and 7 m/s and giving it a relatively soft landing.\\"Parachutes with retro rockets\\". Retrieved 4 March 2014. It allowed a BMD to be relatively safely parachuted with both the driver and the gunner. This system entered service in 1975 for the BMD-1, and was always used for the BMD-2 afterwards. =Amphibious ability= The BMD-2 is fully amphibious, it can swim after switching on the two electric bilge pumps, erecting the two piece trim vane which improves vehicle's stability and displacement in water and prevents the water from flooding the bow of the tank and switching the driver's periscope for a swimming periscope that enables the driver to see over the trim vane. =Armour protection= The aluminium armour thickness is 7 mm on the turret, 15 mm on the front of the hull and 10 mm on the rest of the hull. Hull's front armour has two sections: upper and lower. The upper section is angled at 78¬∞ while the lower one is angled at 50¬∞. It's resistant to small arms fire and shrapnel. =Troop compartment= Rear view of BMD-2 The design was made in order to save necessary weight, and sacrifices crew comfort.Maksim Sayenko. \\"Bronya ¬ªkrylyatoy pyekhoty¬´\\" (Armour of \\"Winged infantry\\"). Tekhnika i Vooruzhenie no.08/2006, p. 28-32 . Retrieved 4 March 2014. Like the BMD-1, the BMD-2 has an extremely cramped interior space. It is much smaller than the ones inside the BMP-1 and BMP-2 IFVs. It can carry five infantrymen, including vehicle's commander, bow machine gunner and three soldiers seated behind the turret. It is equipped with periscope vision blocks on the sides and rear of the vehicle. Also there are only three firing ports, two on each side of the hull and one in the rear. =Equipment= The BMD-2 has the same equipment except for the R-123 radio set which was replaced by the R-123M radio set. Service history Donbass People's Militia BMD-2 entered service with Soviet airborne forces in 1985. They took part in Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. Later they were used by Russian airborne units of SFOR including the Russian airborne brigade stationed in Tojsici which supported the Operation Joint Guard. It is also used by Russian airborne units stationed in Abkhazia. BMD-2s were also employed by Russian 234th Airborne Assault Regiment in the Russo-Georgian War in 2008, one of their number being lost in action. =War in Donbass= BMD-2s were used by units of the Ukrainian Airmobile Forces, and by separatists of Novorossiya. Ukrainian Airborne BMD-2s were some of the first armored vehicles destroyed in the conflict.

Its purpose is to keep outsiders out of the conversation. The ultimate origin of the word is the Latin word , through Catalan (brother) and (\\"brotherhood, guild\\"). Some documentation for it occurs in picaresque works as early as the Spanish Golden Century, such as in Quevedo's El Busc√≥n.Christopher J. Pountain, A History of the Spanish Language Through Texts (Routledge, 2000), 159. Some writers used it in poetry for comical effect. After the arrival of the Romani people and their frequent imprisonment, german√≠a incorporated much vocabulary from Romany and its descendant, the cal√≥ jargon. As time passed, several words entered popular use and even standard Spanish, losing their value for secrecy. German√≠a survives today in the cheli jargon. War of the German√≠as The term german√≠a (\\"brotherhood\\" in Catalan‚Äîcompare with Galician irmandade and Spanish hermandad) originated from the name of a revolt against the local nobility in Valencia, Spain during the sixteenth century. Subsequently, the term referred to the argot used by these communities and, eventually, it referred to improper argot. Use in literature Characters in the original Spanish version of Arturo P√©rez-Reverte's Captain Alatriste series make use of german√≠a.

A United Methodist Church bishop and nationalist leader, he held office for only a few months. Early life Muzorewa was the eldest of a lay preacher's eight children and was educated at the United Methodist School, Old Umtali, near Mutare. He was a school teacher at Mrewa between 1943 and 1947 before becoming a full-time lay preacher at Mtoko between 1947 and 1949. He then studied theology at Old Umtali Biblical College (1949‚Äì1952) and was ordained as a Minister at Umtali in August 1953. He was a pastor at Chiduku, near Rusape, from 1955 to 1958. Muzorewa attended Central College in Fayette, Missouri, later Central Methodist University. By then he had a wife and three sons, who lived with him in prefabricated student housing, while his sons attended a segregated school. His youngest son Wesley and playmate Mark Elrod (son of the college librarian J. McRee Elrod) attempted to integrate the ice cream counter of the local drug store, but were turned away. When Elrod took Muzorewa to visit Scarritt College in Nashville, Tennessee, they were turned away from an eating facility, an incident he mentions in his autobiography. However, he later graduated as a Master of Arts from Scarritt (now a conference center). In July 1963, Muzorewa became pastor of Old Umtali. A year later he was appointed National Director of the Christian Youth Movement and was seconded to the Christian Council. In 1966, he became Secretary of the Student Christian Movement. In 1968, at Masera in Botswana, he was consecrated as the United Methodist Church's Bishop of Rhodesia. United African National Council In 1971 the British government struck a deal with Ian Smith that provided for a transition to \\"majority rule\\" in exchange for an end to sanctions against the government. Muzorewa joined an inexperienced cleric, the Reverend Canaan Banana, to form the United African National Council (UANC) to oppose the settlement, under the acronym NIBMAR (no independence before majority rule). The proposed referendum was withdrawn and Muzorewa found himself a national leader and an international personality. The government opposition movements‚Äîthe Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) of Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole and the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) of Joshua Nkomo‚Äîboth placed themselves under the UANC umbrella even though they had some doubts when Muzorewa founded a national party. After ZANU (led by Robert Mugabe after disagreements with Sithole) and ZAPU undertook guerrilla warfare, the UANC was the only legal black party, since it rejected violence. Internal Settlement Muzorewa in 1975 On 3 March 1978, Muzorewa, Sithole and other non-exiled leaders signed an agreement at Government House, Salisbury, which paved the way for the interim government, the leadership of which was an Executive Council made up of Muzorewa, Sithole and Jeremiah Chirau, along with Ian Smith. This Executive Council was to run the affairs of state prior to elections taking place. A new constitution was drafted reserving 10 seats in the Senate and 28 seats in the House of Assembly for the white minority, and a quarter of the Cabinet positions. The constitution was approved in a nearly whites-only referendum that took place in January 1979. An overwhelming majority of 85% voted yes. Elections were held, and the UANC won. Josiah Gumede was the first President, Muzorewa became prime minister and the country's name was changed to Zimbabwe Rhodesia. However, the war that Smith hoped to stem as a result of the settlement continued unabated. Mugabe and Nkomo rejected the settlement, ending any realistic chance for Muzorewa to gain any international legitimacy. While ZANU and ZAPU could have taken part in the elections if they laid down their arms, they refused to do so. The internal settlement was also condemned by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 423 of 1978, which declared any settlement drafted under the \\"illegal racist minority regime\\" to be \\"illegal and unacceptable.\\" Lancaster House Agreement The British government asked all parties to come to London for negotiations to find a lasting solution to the Bush War. Nkomo and Mugabe attended the conference under the \\"Patriotic Front\\" (PF) banner. The conference was held from 10 September to 15 December 1979, under the chairmanship of Lord Carrington, the British Foreign Secretary. Muzorewa was persuaded to accept fresh elections, to be held in early 1980. In accordance with the final agreement, Muzorewa's government revoked UDI on 11 December 1979 and dissolved itself. As part of a transition to internationally recognised independence, the country once again became the British colony of Southern Rhodesia pending elections. The parliamentary elections took place at the end of February 1980, after a campaign filled with much intimidation by Mugabe's ZANU. The British government briefly considered disqualifying ZANU from participating in the elections for flagrant violation of the Lancaster House Agreement, but in the end did nothing. On 4 March 1980, the elections resulted in a majority for Mugabe and ZANU. The UANC won only three out of 80 seats reserved for Africans in the House of Assembly. Under Mugabe, \\"Zimbabwe Rhodesia\\" became the Republic of Zimbabwe, or \\"Zimbabwe\\". Visit to Israel, arrest and hunger strike Muzorewa visited Israel on 21 October 1983. He urged Mugabe to establish diplomatic relations, saying his political policies hurt Zimbabwe's agriculture and technology industries. The Zimbabwean government arrested Muzorewa on 1 November on charges of conspiring against Mugabe for the South African government. Two days later Mugabe warned Ndabaningi Sithole and Joshua Nkomo against 'conspiring'. Muzorewa then went on a hunger strike, which lasted from 3 to 11 November.Kalley, Jacqueline Audrey. Southern African Political History: A chronological of key political events from independence to, 1999. Page 726. 1996 and 2008 presidential elections Muzorewa stood against Mugabe in the presidential election of 1996, but pulled out after the Supreme Court turned down his bid to postpone the elections on the basis that the electoral rules were unfair (as state funds were only available to parties with 15 or more seats in parliament).Zimbabwe President's Last Rival Withdraws From Election New York Times, 16 March 1996 He remained on the ballot and won 4.8% of the popular vote. On 21 June 2007, Muzorewa said citizens, black and white alike, came to his house and asked him to run for president. He said Zimbabwe was \\"bleeding, economically and socially. It is painful to listen to them talk.\\" He asked people to pray that negotiations between ZANU-PF and the MDC, mediated by South African President Thabo Mbeki, would be successful and for Zimbabwe's \\"salvation.\\" Ultimately Muzorewa did not run in the 2008 presidential election. Death and burial Muzorewa died aged 84 from cancer at his home in Harare on 8 April 2010. The Director of Christian Care, Reverend Forbes Matonga, described Muzorewa's legacy as including \\"his role in the country's transition to independence, the Methodist Church and the founding of Africa University in the eastern Zimbabwean city of Mutare\\". Political commentator John Makumbe said Muzorewa's legacy in Zimbabwe would be that of \\"a man of peace\\".

He was known for his heavily researched novels, many with a sexual theme. Early life Wallace was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Bessie Liss and Alexander Wallace (an Americanized version of the original family name of Wallechinsky). The family was Jewish and originally from Russia. Wallace was named after his maternal grandfather, a bookkeeper and Talmudic scholar of Narewka. Wallace grew up at 6103 Eighteenth Avenue in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where he attended Kenosha Central High School.Short biography on the WLA website . He was the father of Olympic historian David Wallechinsky and author Amy Wallace. Career Wallace began selling stories to magazines when he was a teenager. In the Second World War Wallace served in the Frank Capra unit in Fort Fox along with Theodor Seuss Geisel ‚Äì better known as Dr. Seuss ‚Äì and continued to write for magazines. He also served in the First Motion Picture Unit of the Army Air Force. Soon, however, Wallace turned to a more lucrative job as a Hollywood screenwriter. He collaborated on such films as The West Point Story (1950), Split Second (1953), Meet Me at the Fair (1953), and The Big Circus (1959). He also contributed three scriptshttp://listofepisodes.org/writer/Irving_Wallace to the western television program Have Gun ‚Äì Will Travel. After an unsatisfying stint in Hollywood, he devoted himself full-time to writing books. He published his first non-fiction work in 1955, The Fabulous Originals, and his first fiction offering, The Sins of Philip Fleming, in 1959. The latter, ignored by critics, was followed by the enormously successful The Chapman Report. Wallace published 33 books during his lifetime, translated into 31 languages. Irving Wallace was married to Sylvia (n√©e Kahn) Wallace, a former magazine writer and editor. Her first novel, The Fountains, was an American best-seller and published in twelve foreign editions. Her second novel, Empress, was published in 1980. She also helped him to produce, along with their two children, The Book of Lists#2 and The Intimate Sex Lives Of Famous People. In her autobiography, Amy Wallace wrote that her mother's contributions were not always helpful and the atmosphere not always harmonious.Sorcerer's Apprentice ‚Äì Amy Wallace (Frog, 2003), p. 125 Sylvia Wallace died October 20, 2006 at the age of 89. Several of Wallace's books have been made into films, including The Chapman Report, The Man, and The Seven Minutes. Also among his best known books are The Prize (1962), The Word (1972) and The Fan Club (1974). Michael Korda and Peter Schwed were the editors for Wallace at Simon & Schuster. In his autobiography Another Life, Korda suggests that Wallace invented a style of novel that is at once a strong story and encyclopedia, with \\"some sex thrown in to keep the reader's pulse going.\\" Wallace loved and championed the underdog. He enjoyed writing the stories of outsiders, which interest saw light in The Square Pegs: Some Americans Who Dared to Be Different. With his son, daughter and wife he produced some notable non-fiction works, including three editions each of The People's Almanac (with son David) and The Book of Lists (with David and Amy and wife Sylvia for the second volume). Many of the odd facts Wallace uncovered he also used in his novels. Wallace died of pancreatic cancer on June 29, 1990 at age 74. He was interred at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.

It was constructed from captured Soviet BT-7 light tanks and British 4.5-inch howitzers (114 mm-calibre light howitzer, model 1908) from 1918, which had been donated during the Winter War. Only eighteen vehicles were constructed. Development and use As the Second World War progressed, the Soviets were fielding better and better tanks. The Finnish Army, on the other hand, had to make do with a large number of captured tanks, which were for the most part lightly armored and armed. The Finns decided to redesign the BT-7 Model 1937 tank. They constructed a new turret and armed it with British-made 114.3 mm howitzers that had been supplied by the British during the Winter War (Q.F. 4,5 inch howitzer Mark II, also known as 114 Psv.H/18 in Finland). Eighteen BT-42 were built and these were pressed into service in 1943. These converted vehicles quickly became very unpopular with their crews. The weaknesses could mainly be attributed to the new turret, which apart from giving the tank a high-profile also added significant weight to the vehicle, stressing the suspension and the engine. The BT-42 was used for the first time in 1943, at the Svir River, where it was used against enemy pillboxes. The design worked reasonably well against soft targets but was completely unsuitable for anti- tank warfare. To counter this, the Finns copied a German-designed HEAT round for the gun and it was initially thought that it would be effective against the sloped armour of the T-34. However, problems arose with the copied HEAT shells fuses, which apparently did not arm themselves correctly after firing, due to the different muzzle velocity and round spin rate of the 4.5 inch howitzer compared to the original German guns.The Finnish HEAT shell was called \\"114 hkr 42/C-18/24-38 is 32-18/24\\" and it was equipped with a \\"Hl/C\\" warhead. The German 10.5 cm HEAT grenade, which it had been modelled after, could penetrate 100 mm of steel at a 60-degree angle of impact. Thus it was estimated that the Finnish shell, with its larger calibre, could penetrate 110-115 mm, but its fuse very often failed to function properly, leaving the projectile simply bouncing off on impact without doing any meaningful damage. The BT-42s were used again during the major Soviet offensive in 1944. They were deployed in the defence of Vyborg. In one encounter, a Finnish BT-42 hit a Soviet T-34 18 times, failing even to immobilize the enemy vehicle, as this vehicle's fuses failed to work correctly. Eight of the 18 BT-42s in action made no significant contribution to the fighting. At the time Finnish armored units were still composed mostly of older designs such as the Vickers 6-Ton, T-26 and T-28 tanks, and all of these suffered losses. Emergency supplies of Panzer IV tanks and StuG III self-propelled assault guns from Germany, as well as captured T-34s, made it possible for the Finns to replace its losses with more effective vehicles. The BT-42 was retired soon after the Vyborg battles, replaced in their intended role by German-made StuG IIIs.

Such videos have often been released without the consent of their subjects and have damaged celebrities' careers. In 1988, for example, a sex tape caused significant damage to Rob Lowe's career. The surfacing of sex tapes has become so common that some are \\"leaked\\" as a marketing tool to advance or establish a media career. A celebrity can fight the release in court to maintain deniability while still enjoying the career benefits. In contrast, a celebrity may take the route of openly releasing the tape and benefit directly from royalties as well as indirectly from the publicity. The current public acceptance of celebrities with sex tapes is speculated by Joe Levy, executive editor of Rolling Stone, to be due to the easy availability of pornography, as well as couples more commonly making their own tapes due to the prevalence of video cameras. Famous celebrity sex tapes The following is an alphabetical list by surname of individuals known to have their sexual acts recorded and distributed:  A  *Farrah Abraham, the former Teen Mom star, had a pornographic film released by Vivid Entertainment in May 2013 that was marketed as a sex tape.

An expert in gender and sexuality law, she is a consultant in attaining specific goals of social justice. Vaid has been closely involved with the National LGBTQ Task Force. She is the author of the book Virtual Equality, published in 1996. Career Vaid is CEO of the Vaid Group LLC, which works with social justice innovators, movements and organizations to address structural inequalities based on sexual orientation, gender identity, race, gender and economic status. She was the Director of the Engaging Tradition Project at the Center for Gender and Sexuality Law at Columbia Law School from 2011 to 2015. The project focused on the way tradition is used in movements for gender and sexuality to inform, enable or limit the movement.http://urvashivaid.net/wp/?page_id=2 Vaid spent ten years working in global philanthropic organizations, serving as Executive Director of the Arcus Foundation (2005-2010) and Deputy Director of Governance and Civil Society Unit of the Ford Foundation (2000-2005). Vaid is the founder of LPAC, the first lesbian Super PAC, which was launched in July 2012. She serves on the Board of Directors of the Gill Foundation, which is dedicated to achieving equal opportunity for all, regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity. She is founder of The Vaid Group, a consulting practice that advises individuals and organizations working to achieve social justice in a wide range of fields. For more than 10 years, Vaid worked in various capacities at the National LGBTQ Task Force (NGLTF), the oldest national LGBT civil rights organization; first as its media director, then as executive director, and as director of its Policy Institute Think-tank. From 1983 to 1986, Vaid was staff attorney at the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), where she initiated the organization's work on HIV/AIDS in prisons.  Political activism  Vaid was born in New Delhi, India, and moved to the United States at age eight with her family. At age 11, she participated in the anti-Vietnam war movement. At Vassar College, she was active in a variety of political and social causes. She received a J.D. degree from Northeastern University School of Law in Boston in 1983, where she founded the Boston Lesbian/Gay Political Alliance, a non-partisan political organization that interviews and endorses candidates for political office and advocates for Boston's gay community. Vaid believes that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) equality will only occur when the larger institutions of society and the family are transformed to be more inclusive of racial, gender, economic difference. Her book Virtual Equality: The Mainstreaming of Gay and Lesbian Liberation (1995), which won a Stonewall Book Award in 1996, makes an argument that mainstreaming sexuality into the status quo is not the same as transforming societal institutions to make them more equitable. Her book Irresistible Revolution: Confronting Race, Class and the Assumptions of LGBT Politics (2012) critiques the racial and gender bias of mainstream LGBT movement and continues her argument that engagement with social justice is what will enable all parts of the LGBT community to realize equality and justice. Vaid became Executive Director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in 1989. She pushed gay issues into the public eye through coordinated media manipulation and staged numerous protests on such subjects as abortion and the Persian Gulf War. Vaid left NGLTF in December 1992 and wrote Virtual Equality (published in 1995). She returned to NGLTF from 1997-2000 as the director of its think tank, the NGLTF Policy Institute, where she initiated work on Racial and Economic Justice, religious and faith organizing, and social science research. Vaid worked for five years at the Ford Foundation, and served as Executive Director of the Arcus Foundation from 2005 through 2010. Vaid has served on the board of the Gill Foundation from 2004-2014.

He also played a key role in the foundation of the International Union for Cooperation in Solar Research and the National Research Council, and in developing the California Institute of Technology into a leading research university. Early life and education George Ellery Hale was born on June 29, 1868, in Chicago, Illinois, to William Ellery Hale and Mary Browne.Adams 1939, p. 181. He is descended from Thomas Hale of Watton-on-Stone, Hertfordshire, England, whose son emigrated to America about 1640. His father acquired a considerable fortune manufacturing and installing passenger elevators during the reconstruction of Chicago, which had been destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.Adams 1939, p. 182. The oldest of three children who lived past childhood, George received strong encouragement from his father, who supported the boy's active mind and curiosity, and his mother, who inculcated in him a love of poetry and literature.Adams 1939, pp. 182‚Äì83. He spent his youth fascinated by the books and machinery given to him by his parents‚Äîone of his most prized possessions was a small microscope. With his father's encouragement, he built a small shop in their house that turned into a laboratory.Adams 1939, p. 183. The microscope led to his interest in optics. At the age of fourteen, George built his first telescope. His father later replaced it with a second-hand Clark refractor that they mounted on the roof of their Kenwood house. Soon he was photographing the night skies, observing a partial eclipse of the sun, and drawing sun-spots. As an avid reader with a strong interest in the budding field of astrophysics, Hale was drawn to the writings of William Huggins, Norman Lockyer, and Ernest Rutherford.Adams 1939, p. 184. His fascination with science, however, did not preclude interests more typical of a normal boy, such as fishing, boating, swimming, skating, tennis, and bicycling. He was an enthusiastic reader of the stories of Jules Verne‚Äîparticularly drawn to the tales of adventure set in the mountains of California. Hale spent summers at his grandmother's house in the old New England village of Madison, Connecticut, where he met his future wife, Evelina Conklin.Adams 1939, pp. 184‚Äì85. After graduating from Oakland Public School in Chicago, Hale attended the Allen Academy, where he studied chemistry, physics, and astronomy.Adams 1939, p. 185. He supplemented his practical home experience by attending a course in shop-work at the Chicago Manual Training School. During these years, Hale developed a knowledge of the principles of architecture and city planning with the help of his father's friend, well-known architect Daniel Burnham. Upon Burnham's advice and encouragement, Hale decided at the age of seventeen to continue his education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Hale was educated at MIT, at the Harvard College Observatory, (1889‚Äì90), and in Berlin (1893‚Äì94) where he was a PhD student but never finished his degree. At the time he already had an appointment as a professor at the recently established University of Chicago. As an undergraduate at MIT, he is known for inventing the spectroheliograph, with which he made his discovery of solar vortices.  Research  In 1890, he began research at the Kenwood Astrophysical Observatory, which Hale's father had built for him; he was professor of astrophysics at Beloit College (1891‚Äì93); associate professor at the University of Chicago until 1897, and full professor (1897‚Äì1905). He was coeditor of Astronomy and Astrophysics, 1892‚Äì95, and after 1895 editor of the Astrophysical Journal. He also served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as Society for Science & the Public, from 1921 to 1923. In 1908, he used the Zeeman effect with a modified spectroheliograph to establish that sunspots were magnetic. Subsequent work demonstrated a strong tendency for east-west alignment of magnetic polarities in sunspots, with mirror symmetry across the solar equator; and that the polarity in each hemisphere switched orientation from one sunspot cycle to the next. This systematic property of sunspot magnetic fields is now commonly referred to as the \\"Hale‚ÄìNicholson law,\\"Astrophysics of the sun, Harold Zirin, Cambridge University Press, 1988, p.307; http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1988assu.book.....Z or in many cases simply \\"Hale's law.\\" Hale spent a large portion of his career trying to find a way to image the solar corona without the benefit of a total solar eclipse, but this was not achieved until the work of Bernard Lyot. In October 1913, Hale received a letter from Albert Einstein, asking whether certain astronomical observations could be done that would test Einstein's hypothesis concerning the effects of gravity on light. Hale replied in November, saying that such observations could be done only during a total eclipse of the sun.http://alberteinstein.info/vufind1/images/einstein/ear01/view/1/72-296_000012024.pdf  Founding and organizing of institutions  Hale was a driven individual, who worked to found a number of significant astronomical observatories, including Yerkes Observatory, Mount Wilson Observatory, Palomar Observatory, and the Hale Solar Laboratory. At Mount Wilson, he hired and encouraged Harlow Shapley and Edwin Hubble toward some of the most significant discoveries of the time. He was a prolific organizer who helped create a number of astronomical institutions, societies and journals. Hale also played a central role in developing the California Institute of Technology into a leading research university. After retiring as director at Mount Wilson, he built the Hale Solar Laboratory in Pasadena, California, as his office and workshop, pursuing his interest in the sun. From early youth, Hale had been internationally oriented, travelling widely throughout Europe in his younger years. Having long realized the value of an international organization to coordinate scientific research, he pursued, as chairman of a committee of the National Academy of Sciences of the US, the formation of an international organization for solar research. The society's inaugural meeting was held at the St. Louis Exposition of 1904 and included representatives from 16 national scientific societies, but notably not from the Prussian Academy of Sciences, which had declined the invitation. (Instead, German delegates from the German Physical Society were present.) The delegates proceeded to appoint a committee that was to create the International Union for Cooperation in Solar Research as a permanent international scientific organization; the new union had its first constituted meeting at Oxford in England a year later. Further meetings were held in Paris in 1907 and at Mount Wilson in 1910, where the purview of the Union was enlarged to include stellar research, in keeping with Hale's emphasis on the Sun as just one among the many other stars. Shortly after the last meeting in Bonn in 1913, World War I broke out, which effectively put an end to the Union's activities, which would later find continuation after the 1919 founding of the International Astronomical Union. During the war, Hale played a key role in founding the National Research Council to support the government in using science for its policy aims, in particular to further its military ends.Walter S.

It was founded as the Zionist Organization (ZO; 1897‚Äì1960) at the initiative of Theodor Herzl at the First Zionist Congress, which took place in August 1897 in Basel, Switzerland. When it was founded, the goals of the Zionist movement were stated in a resolution that came of that Congress and came to be known as the Basel Program. \\"Zionism aims at establishing for the Jewish people a legally assured home in Palestine. For the attainment of this purpose, the Congress considers the following means serviceable: # The promotion of the settlement of Jewish agriculturists [farmers], artisans, and tradesmen in the Land of Israel # The federation [unified organisation] of all Jews into local or general groups, according to the laws of the various countries # The strengthening of the Jewish feeling and consciousness [national sentiment and national consciousness] # Preparatory steps for the attainment of those governmental grants which are necessary to the achievement of the Zionist purpose.\\" Operating under the aegis of the WZO are organizations that define themselves as Zionist, such as WIZO, Hadassah, B'nai B'rith, Maccabi, the International Sephardic Federation, the World Union of Jewish Students (WUJS), and more. The Jewish Agency is a parallel organisation, with goals, attributes and leadership closely intertwined with those of the Zionist Organization during the years before the establishment of the State of Israel, and to varying degrees after that. Significant changes to the statutes of both organisations occurred in 1952, 1970 and 1979. History Offices of WZO in Tel Aviv Founded as the Zionist Organization (; HaHistadrut HaTsionit), or ZO, in 1897 at the First Zionist Congress, held from August 29 to August 31 in Basel, Switzerland.See Chapter 2: The Seven Years of Herzl of Zionism ‚Äì The First 120 Years by the Jewish Agency. The ZO's newspaper Die Welt was founded in the same year. It changed its name to World Zionist Organization in January 1960. The ZO served as an umbrella organization for the Zionist movement, whose objective was the creation of a Jewish homeland in Eretz Yisrael ‚Äì at that time under the Ottoman Empire and following the First World War, the British Mandate of Palestine. When the State of Israel was declared 51 years later on May 14, 1948, many of its new administrative institutions were already in place, having evolved during the regular Zionist Congresses of the previous decades. Some of these institutions remain to this day. The finances of the WZO were conducted by the Jewish Colonial Trust (founded in 1899), and acquisition of land was conducted by the Jewish National Fund (founded in 1901).Keren Hayesod (founded 1920) funded Zionist and Yishuv activities prior to the creation of the state of Israel through enterprises such as the Palestine Electric Company, the Palestine Potash Company and the Anglo- Palestine Bank. Member card of the (Polish) Zionist Organization, issued in 1929 Membership in the ZO was open to all Jews, and the right to vote for delegates to the congresses was secured by the purchase of the Zionist Shekel. Delegations from all around the world, and from many different political backgrounds and religious traditions, took part in each Congress; delegations/parties were mainly grouped by ideology, rather than by geography. In 1960 the ZO changed its name to the World Zionist Organization and adopted a new constitution under which individuals are ineligible for membership, which is reserved for organizations.

World Zionist Congress The World Zionist Congress established by Theodor Herzl, is the supreme organ of the World Zionist Organization and its legislative authority. It elects the officers and decides on the policies of the WZO and the Jewish Agency. The first World Zionist Congress was held in Basel, Switzerland in 1897. Jerusalem Program The platform of the WZO is the Jerusalem Program. The Zionist Council, meeting in Jerusalem in June 2004, adopted this text as the latest version. \\"Zionism, the national liberation movement of the Jewish people, brought about the establishment of the State of Israel, and views a Jewish, Zionist, democratic and secure State of Israel to be the expression of the common responsibility of the Jewish people for its continuity and future. The foundations of Zionism are: *The unity of the Jewish people, its bond to its historic homeland Eretz Yisrael, and the centrality of the State of Israel and Jerusalem, its capital, in the life of the nation; *Aliyah to Israel from all countries and the effective integration of all immigrants into Israeli Society. *Strengthening Israel as a Jewish, Zionist and democratic state and shaping it as an exemplary society with a unique moral and spiritual character, marked by mutual respect for the multi- faceted Jewish people, rooted in the vision of the prophets, striving for peace and contributing to the betterment of the world. *Ensuring the future and the distinctiveness of the Jewish people by furthering Jewish, Hebrew and Zionist education, fostering spiritual and cultural values and teaching Hebrew as the national language; *Nurturing mutual Jewish responsibility, defending the rights of Jews as individuals and as a nation, representing the national Zionist interests of the Jewish people, and struggling against all manifestations of anti-Semitism; *Settling the country as an expression of practical Zionism.\\" Projects and initiatives The World Zionist Organization is made up of several departments. The Department of Diaspora Affairs aims to build bridges between Jews everywhere and strengthen Zionist identity among young Jews The Department of Aliyah Promotion aims to motivate and assist Jews in the process of immigration to Israel, awaken an interest in learning Hebrew and strengthen ties between the Jewish Diaspora and the State of Israel. The Department of Activities in Israel and Countering Antisemitism seeks to strengthen Jewish Zionist identity among Israelis and combat antisemitism. The Department of Education works to bolster Jewish-Zionist identity and the connection to the State of Israel and the Diaspora through the Hebrew language and educational content in the formal and informal education systems in Israel and the Diaspora.

Controversies A document brought before Israel's Supreme Court in 2009 showed that private Palestinian land was taken and given to Israeli settlers by the World Zionist Organization. The land in question had been ruled off- limits by Israel. The World Zionist Organization had been acting as an agent of the government in assigning land to Jewish settlers in the Israeli-occupied territories. The Israeli government, to avoid responsibilities under international law, used the World Zionist Organization to settle its citizens in the territory occupied in 1967. The document concerns several homes in the Israeli settlement of Ofra, approximately 15 miles north of Jerusalem in the West Bank. The Israeli Justice Ministry confirmed that the land in question was owned by Palestinians and that the nine houses in question had been ordered demolished.

A follow-up version released a year later, \\"54-46 Was My Number\\", was one of the first reggae songs to receive widespread popularity outside Jamaica, and is seen as being one of the defining songs of the genre. It has been anthologised repeatedly and the titles of several reggae anthologies include \\"54-46\\" in their title. The lyrics describe Toots' time in prison after being arrested for possession of marijuana. The song features a similar riddim to \\"Train to Skaville\\" by Toots and the Maytals' contemporaries, The Ethiopians. In popular culture The song was covered and released as a single in 1983 by British reggae band Aswad. This single also featured on their 1984 album Rebel Souls. The song was also covered by dancehall star Yellowman in his song \\"Nobody Move, Nobody Get Hurt\\". It was later covered on Long Beach, CA-based 1990s ska-punk band Sublime's 1992 album 40 Oz. to Freedom in a medley with Sublime original \\"Ball and Chain\\", as well as Buju Banton on his album Inna Heights and Ferm√≠n Muguruza in his album Brigadistak Sound System. The ska legend Byron Lee & the Dragonaires covered the song on their 2002 album Shanty Town. An instrumental version of the song can also be found on the album Below the Bassline by Ernest Ranglin. The Venetian ska band Ska-J recorded an Italian/Venetian-language cover with Venetian-themed lyrics entitled Santamarta. The introduction of the song was sampled on Foxy Brown's single, \\"Oh Yeah\\", released from her third album, Broken Silence. The bass line to the song forms the basis of the 1989 hit \\"Street Tuff\\" by Rebel MC & Double Trouble, and \\"The Bridge is Over\\" by KRS- One. Part of the song was used on the soundtrack to the 2006 film This Is England and since, re-recorded by Kiko Bun for the television series. The song was re-recorded for their album True Love, and is played along with Jeff Beck. The song was covered and recorded by Fighting Gravity, a band with ska roots from Richmond, Virginia. It was also covered by Earl Stevenson (a contestant on Canadian Idol Season 6), on his first solo release Ghost (2010). The punk rock band The Clash paid tribute to the Maytals with their song \\"Jail Guitar Doors\\" recorded in 1978. On the Live at the Lyceum version it ends with Joe Strummer singing \\"54-46 was my number, Right now someone else has that number\\". It was also covered by Vanilla Ice on his 2011 album, W.T.F.

Slusser was a well-known science fiction critic. A professor emeritus of comparative literature at University of California, Riverside, he was the first curator of the Eaton collection. Background Slusser was born in San Francisco in 1939, the son of salesman Raymond Leroy Slusser and Edlo Mildred Raerth. He attended University of California, Berkeley where he studied both philosophy and English. Slusser, a member of Phi Beta Kappa, graduated summa cum laude in 1961 and then attended University of Poitiers, where he earned his diploma in the French language the following year. From 1963 to 1965, Slusser served in Germany assigned to US Army intelligence. In 1965 Slusser married French academic Dani√®le Chatelain, to whom he would remain married for life. Slusser attended Harvard University, afterward taking a Fulbright Fellowship in Germany as well as serving as a Harvard traveling fellow in France. From 1971 to 1975 he taught English at California State College at San Bernardino as an assistant professor, also working as a freelance author, critic, and translator throughout this period. Although Slusser had been a fan of science fiction as a teen his interest in the genre was reignited in San Bernardino. In 1976 Slusser returned to France as a Fulbright lecturer at University of Paris. In 1979 Slusser joined University of California, Riverside (UCR) and organized the first annual J. Lloyd Eaton Conference of Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature, an academic symposium on the genres of science fiction and fantasy literature rather than the more prevalent fan conventions. He commented that the conference's ability to attract serious literary critics like Harry Levin spoke to the event's gravitas. Slusser helped publish an annual journal, Bridges to Science Fiction to publish the outcomes of each conference. With the help of UCR head librarian Eleanor Montague and Cal State San Bernardino librarian Michael Burgess, Slusser became curator of the Eaton collection and Slusser took it upon himself to radically expand the collection's holdings. Slusser had pushed for the establishment of both a science fiction studies center and a graduate program for science fiction at the University but the plan died with university chancellor Tom√°s Rivera. Slusser continued to teach comparative literature at UCR until his retirement in 2005. A host of science fiction writers and scholars have studied under Slusser, including Howard V. Hendrix, David Leiby, Bradford M. Lyau, and Daryl F. Mallett. Writing Slusser wrote dozens of books and journal articles. Much of his work was critical analysis of science fiction. He listed Isaac Asimov, Greg Bear, Gregory Benford, James Blish, Ray Bradbury, David Brin, Robert Heinlein, Robert Silverberg, and Theodore Sturgeon alongside golden age authors J.-H. Rosny, Olaf Stapledon, Jules Verne, H. G. Wells as the best science fiction writers primarily because of their focus on science in their writings. Slusser praised Bradbury saying \\"Bradbury just exuded this kind of folksiness that made his works extremely visual... A lot of science fiction writing came out of that Midwestern, iconic American experience that Bradbury defined.\\" Slusser mentioned that Bradbury's technophobia was evident in his works: \\"to Bradbury, science is the forbidden fruit, destroyer of Eden.\\" Of Arthur C. Clark, Slusser said that \\"Clarke, along with Asimov and [Robert A.] Heinlein, is unique in that his human dramas are determined by advances in science and technology... Clarke incarnates the essence of [science fiction], which is to blend two otherwise opposite activities into a single story, that of the advancement of mankind.\\" Although Slusser considered Robert A. Heinlein the \\"epitome of science fiction writers\\" his criticism of the author was far more pointed. Slusser dismissed Heinlein's later work as \\"self-indulgent.\\" Slusser points out that stories like Heinlein's Have Space Suit‚ÄîWill Travel draw students because it's \\"like 'Huckleberry Finn' redone.\\" In Robert A. Heinlein, Stranger in His Own Land Slusser condemned the secular sort of Unconditional election philosophy Heinlein propounded in his books: \\"Heinlein is a writer who represents a certain strain in our culture, a kind of secular Calvinist vision of the world of the elect and the damned.\\" (Heinlein refuted this interpretation.) Slusser labeled both Heinlein and author Frank Herbert as \\"potboilers.\\" Slusser and his wife co-authored a few translations from the original French. In 2012, Slusser and his wife translated the works of J.-H. Rosny into Three Science Fiction Novellas: From Prehistory to the End of Mankind. =Published works=      * References University of California, Riverside faculty American biographers American literary critics 1939 births 2014 deaths Harvard University alumni People from San Francisco University of California, Berkeley alumni University of Poitiers alumni Fulbright Scholars California State University, San Bernardino faculty Journalists from California ","title":"George Edgar Slusser"},{"id":"623549","text":"Sardar Sarovar Dam on Narmada River The Sardar Sarovar Dam is a concrete gravity dam on the Narmada river in Kevadiya near Navagam, Gujarat in India. Four Indian states, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, receive water and electricity supplied from the dam. The foundation stone of the project was laid out by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on 5 April 1961. The project took form in 1979 as part of a development scheme funded by the World Bank through their International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to increase irrigation and produce hydroelectricity, using a loan of US$200 million. The construction for dam begun in 1987, but the project was stalled by the Supreme Court of India in 1995 in the backdrop of Narmada Bachao Andolan over concerns of displacement of people. In 2000‚Äì01 the project was revived but with a lower height of 110.64 metres under directions from SC, which was later increased in 2006 to 121.92 meters and 138.98 meters in 2017.https://indianexpress.com/article/india/sardar-sarovar-dam-years-of- dispute-finally-full-height-narmada-river-narendra-modi-4848513/ The water level in the Sardar Sarovar Dam at Kevadia in Narmada district reached its highest capacity at 138.68 metres on 15 September 2019. One of the 30 dams planned on river Narmada, Sardar Sarovar Dam (SSD) is the largest structure to be built. It is the second largest concrete dam in the world in terms of the volume of concrete used to construct dam after the Grand Coulee dam across River Columbia, US.. It is a part of the Narmada Valley Project, a large hydraulic engineering project involving the construction of a series of large irrigation and hydroelectric multi-purpose dams on the Narmada river. Following a number of controversial cases before the Supreme Court of India (1999, 2000, 2003), by 2014 the Narmada Control Authority had approved a series of changes in the final height ‚Äì and the associated displacement caused by the increased reservoir, from the original to a final from foundation. The project will irrigate more than , most of it in drought prone areas of Kutch and Saurashtra. The dam's main power plant houses six 200 MW Francis pump- turbines to generate electricity and include a pumped-storage capability. Additionally, a power plant on the intake for the main canal contains five 50 MW Kaplan turbine-generators. The total installed capacity of the power facilities is 1,450 MW. Geographical location To the south west Malwa plateau, the dissected hill tracts culminate in the Mathwar hills, located in Alirajpur district of Madhya Pradesh. Below these hills Narmada river flows through a long, terrific gorge. This gorge extends into Gujarat where the river is tapped by the Sardar Sarovar dam. Narmada Canal The dam irrigates of land spread over 12 districts, 62 talukas, and 3,393 villages (75% of which is drought-prone areas) in Gujarat and in the arid areas of Barmer and Jalore districts of Rajasthan. The dam also provides flood protection to riverine reaches measuring covering 210 villages and Bharuch city and a population of 400,000 in Gujarat. Saurashtra Narmada Avtaran Irrigation is a major program to help irrigate a lot of regions using the canal's water. = Solar power generation = In 2011, the government of Gujarat announced plans to generate solar power by placing solar panels over the canal, making it beneficial for the surrounding villages to get power and also help to reduce the evaporation of water. The first phase consists of placing panels along a 25 km length of the canal, with capacity for up to, 25 MW of power. Controversy The dam is one of India's most controversial, and its environmental impact and net costs and benefits are widely debated. The World Bank was initially funding SSD, but withdrew in 1994 at the request of the Government of India when the state governments were unable to comply with the loan's environmental and other requirements. The Narmada Dam has been the centre of controversy and protests since the late 1980s. One such protest takes centre stage in the Spanner Films documentary Drowned Out (2002), which follows one tribal family who decide to stay at home and drown rather than make way for the Narmada Dam. An earlier documentary film is called A Narmada Diary (1995) by Anand Patwardhan and Simantini Dhuru. The efforts of Narmada Bachao Andolan (\\"Save Narmada Movement\\") to seek \\"social and environmental justice\\" for those most directly affected by the Sardar Sarovar Dam construction feature prominently in this film. It received the (Filmfare Award for Best Documentary-1996). The figurehead of much of the protest is Medha Patkar, the leader of the NBAFriends of River Narmada. Retrieved 9 July 2007 The Sardar Sarovar Dam: a Brief Introduction The movement was cemented in 1989, and received the Right Livelihood Award in 1991. Frontview of Sardar Sarovar Dam In an opinion piece in The Guardian, the campaign led by the NBA activists was accused of holding up the project's completion and of even physically attacking local people who accepted compensation for moving. Support for the protests also came from Indian author Arundhati Roy, who wrote \\"The Greater Common Good\\", an essay reprinted in her book The Cost of Living, in protest of the Narmada Dam Project. In the essay, Roy states: > Big Dams are to a Nation's \\"Development\\" what Nuclear Bombs are to its > Military Arsenal. They are both weapons of mass destruction. They're both > weapons Governments use to control their own people. Both Twentieth Century > emblems that mark a point in time when human intelligence has outstripped > its own instinct for survival.

The Townshend Acts () or Townshend Duties, refers to a series of British acts of Parliament passed during 1767 and 1768 relating to the British colonies in America. They are named after Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer who proposed the program. Historians vary slightly as to which acts they include under the heading \\"Townshend Acts\\", but five are often listed:Dickerson (Navigation Acts, 195‚Äì95) for example, writes that there were four Townshend Acts, and does not mention the New York Restraining Act, which Chaffin says was \\"officially a part of the Potato Acts\\" (\\"Townshend Acts\\", 128). * The New York Restraining Act 1767 passed on June 5, 1767 * The Revenue Act 1767 passed on June 26, 1767 * The Indemnity Act 1767 passed on June 29, 1767 * The Commissioners of Customs Act 1767 passed on June 29, 1767 * The Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768 passed on July 6, 1768 The purposes of the acts were to: * raise revenue in the colonies to pay the salaries of governors and judges so that they would remain loyal to Great Britain * create more effective means of enforcing compliance with trade regulations * punish the Province of New York for failing to comply with the 1765 Quartering Act * establish the precedent that the British Parliament had the right to tax the coloniesChaffin, \\"Townshend Acts\\", 126. The Townshend Acts were met with resistance in the colonies, which eventually resulted in the Boston Massacre of 1770. They placed an indirect tax on glass, lead, paints, paper, and tea, all of which had to be imported from Britain. This form of revenue generation was Townshend's response to the failure of the Stamp Act of 1765, which had provided the first form of direct taxation placed upon the colonies. However, the import duties proved to be similarly controversial. Colonial indignation over the acts was expressed in John Dickinson's Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania and in the Massachusetts Circular Letter. There was widespread protest, and American port cities refused to import British goods, so Parliament began to partially repeal the Townshend duties.Chaffin, \\"Townshend Acts\\", 143. In March 1770, most of the taxes from the Townshend Acts were repealed by Parliament under Frederick, Lord North. However, the import duty on tea was retained in order to demonstrate to the colonists that Parliament held the sovereign authority to tax its colonies, in accordance with the Declaratory Act of 1766. The British government continued to tax the American colonies without providing representation in Parliament. American resentment, corrupt British officials, and abusive enforcement spurred colonial attacks on British ships, including the burning of the Gaspee in 1772. The Townshend Acts' taxation on imported tea was enforced once again by the Tea Act of 1773, and this led to the Boston Tea Party in 1773 in which Bostonians destroyed a shipment of taxed tea. Parliament responded with severe punishments in the Intolerable Acts of 1774. The Thirteen Colonies drilled their militia units, and war finally erupted in Lexington and Concord in April 1775, launching the American Revolution. Background Following the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763), the British government was deep in debt. To pay a small fraction of the costs of the newly expanded empire, the Parliament of Great Britain decided to levy new taxes on the colonies of British America. Previously, through the Trade and Navigation Acts, Parliament had used taxation to regulate the trade of the empire. But with the Sugar Act of 1764, Parliament sought, for the first time, to tax the colonies for the specific purpose of raising revenue. American colonists argued that there were constitutional issues involved.Reid, Authority to Tax, 206. The Americans claimed they were not represented in Parliament, but the British government retorted that they had \\"virtual representation\\", a concept the Americans rejected. This issue, only briefly debated following the Sugar Act, became a major point of contention after Parliament's passage of the Stamp Act 1765. The Stamp Act proved to be wildly unpopular in the colonies, contributing to its repeal the following year, along with the failure to raise substantial revenue. Implicit in the Stamp Act dispute was an issue more fundamental than taxation and representation: the question of the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.Thomas, Townshend Duties, 10. Parliament provided its answer to this question when it repealed the Stamp Act in 1766 by simultaneously passing the Declaratory Act, which proclaimed that Parliament could legislate for the colonies \\"in all cases whatsoever\\".Knollenberg, Growth, 21‚Äì25. The five Townshend Acts=The New York Restraining Act 1767= This was the first of the five acts, passed on June 5, 1767. It forbade the New York Assembly and the governor of New York from passing any new bills until they agreed to comply with the Quartering Act 1765, which required them to pay for and provide housing, food and supplies for British troops in the colony. New York resisted the Quartering Act because it amounted to taxation without representation, since they had no representatives in Parliament. Further, New York and the other colonies did not believe British soldiers were any longer necessary in the colonies, since the French and Indian War had come to an end. However, New York reluctantly agreed to pay for at least some of the soldiers' needs as they understood they were going to be punished by Parliament unless they acted. The New York Restraining Act was never implemented because the New York Assembly acted in time. =The Revenue Act 1767= This was the second of the five acts, passed on June 26, 1767. It placed taxes on glass, lead, painters' colors, and paper. It gave customs officials broad authority to enforce the taxes and punish smugglers through the use of \\"writs of assistance\\", general warrants that could be used to search private property for smuggled goods. There was an angry response from colonists, who deemed the taxes a threat to their rights as British subjects. The use of writs of assistance was significantly controversial, since the right to be secure in one's private property was an established right in Britain. =The Indemnity Act 1767= This act was the (joint) third act, passed on June 29, 1767, the same day as the Commissioners of Customs Act (see below). 'Indemnity' means 'security or protection against a loss or other financial burden'. The Indemnity Act 1767 reduced taxes on the British East India Company when they imported tea into England. This allowed them to re-export the tea to the colonies more cheaply and resell it to the colonists. Until this time, all items had to be shipped to England first from wherever they were made, and then re-exported to their destination, including to the colonies. This followed from the principle of mercantilism in England, which meant the colonies were forced to trade only with England.http://score.rims.k12.ca.us/score_lessons/market_to_market/pages/mercantilism_imports_and_e.htm The British East India Company was one of England's largest companies, but was on the verge of collapse due to much cheaper smuggled Dutch tea. Part of the purpose of the entire series of Townshend Acts was to save the company from imploding. Since tea smuggling had become a common and successful practice, Parliament realized how difficult it was to enforce the taxing of tea. The Act stated that no more taxes would be placed on tea, and it made the cost of the East India Company's tea less than tea that was smuggled via Holland. It was an incentive for the colonists to purchase the East India Company tea. =The Commissioners of Customs Act 1767= This act was passed on June 29, 1767 also. It created a new Customs Board for the North American colonies, to be headquartered in Boston with five customs commissioners. New offices were eventually opened in other ports as well. The Board was created to enforce shipping regulations and increase tax revenue. Previously, customs enforcement was handled by the Customs Board back in England. Due to the distance, enforcement was poor, taxes were avoided and smuggling was rampant. Once the new Customs Board was in operation, enforcement increased, leading to confrontation with smuggling colonists. Incidents between customs and officials, military personnel and colonists broke out across the colonies, eventually leading to the occupation of Boston by British troops. This led to the Boston Massacre. =The Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768= This was the last of the five acts passed. It was not passed until July 6, 1768, a full year after the other four. Lord Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, after whom the Townshend Acts were named, had died suddenly in September, 1767. Because of this, some scholars do not include the Vice-Admiralty Court Act with the other Townshend Acts, but most do since it deals with the same issues. The Act was not passed by Parliament, but by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, with the approval of the King. The Act was passed to aid the prosecution of smugglers. It gave Royal naval courts, rather than colonial courts, jurisdiction over all matters concerning customs violations and smuggling. Before the Act, customs violators could be tried in an admiralty court in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, if royal prosecutors believed they would not get a favorable outcome using a local judge and jury. The Vice- Admiralty Court Act added three new royal admiralty courts in Boston, Philadelphia and Charleston to aid in more effective prosecutions. These courts were run by judges appointed by the Crown and who were awarded 5% of any fine the judge levied when they found someone guilty. The decisions were made solely by the judge, without the option of trial by jury, which was considered to be a fundamental right of British subjects. In addition, the accused person had to travel to the court of jurisdiction at his own expense; if he did not appear, he was automatically considered guilty. Townshend's program=Raising revenue= The first of the Townshend Acts, sometimes simply known as the Townshend Act, was the Revenue Act 1767.The Revenue Act 1767 was 7 Geo. III ch. 46; Knollenberg, Growth, 47; Labaree, Tea Party, 270n12. It is also known as the Townshend Revenue Act, the Townshend Duties Act, and the Tariff Act 1767. This act represented the Chatham ministry's new approach to generating tax revenue in the American colonies after the repeal of the Stamp Act in 1766.Chaffin, \\"Townshend Acts\\", 143; Thomas, Duties Crisis, 9. The British government had gotten the impression that because the colonists had objected to the Stamp Act on the grounds that it was a direct (or \\"internal\\") tax, colonists would therefore accept indirect (or \\"external\\") taxes, such as taxes on imports.Reid, Authority to Tax, 33‚Äì39. With this in mind, Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, devised a plan that placed new duties on paper, paint, lead, glass, and tea that were imported into the colonies.Thomas, Duties Crisis, 9; Labaree, Tea Party, 19‚Äì20. These were items that were not produced in North America and that the colonists were only allowed to buy from Great Britain.Chaffin, \\"Townshend Acts\\", 127. The colonists' objection to \\"internal\\" taxes did not mean that they would accept \\"external\\" taxes; the colonial position was that any tax laid by Parliament for the purpose of raising revenue was unconstitutional. \\"Townshend's mistaken belief that Americans regarded internal taxes as unconstitutional and external taxes constitutional\\", wrote historian John Phillip Reid, \\"was of vital importance in the history of events leading to the Revolution.\\"Reid, Authority to Tax, 33. The Townshend Revenue Act received the royal assent on 29 June 1767.Thomas, Duties Crisis, 31. There was little opposition expressed in Parliament at the time. \\"Never could a fateful measure have had a more quiet passage\\", wrote historian Peter Thomas. The Revenue Act was passed in conjunction with the Indemnity Act 1767,The Indemnity Act was 7 Geo. III ch. 56; Labaree, Tea Party, 269n20. It is also known as the Tea Act 1767; Jensen, Founding, 435. which was intended to make the tea of the British East India Company more competitive with smuggled Dutch tea.Dickerson, Navigation Acts, 196. The Indemnity Act repealed taxes on tea imported to England, allowing it to be re-exported more cheaply to the colonies. This tax cut in England would be partially offset by the new Revenue Act taxes on tea in the colonies.Labaree,Tea Party, 21. The Revenue Act also reaffirmed the legality of writs of assistance, or general search warrants, which gave customs officials broad powers to search houses and businesses for smuggled goods.Reid, Rebellious Spirit, 29, 135n24. The original stated purpose of the Townshend duties was to raise a revenue to help pay the cost of maintaining an army in North America.Thomas, Duties Crisis, 22‚Äì23. Townshend changed the purpose of the tax plan, however, and instead decided to use the revenue to pay the salaries of some colonial governors and judges.Thomas, Duties Crisis, 23‚Äì25. Previously, the colonial assemblies had paid these salaries, but Parliament hoped to take the \\"power of the purse\\"Thomas, Duties Crisis, 260. away from the colonies. According to historian John C. Miller, \\"Townshend ingeniously sought to take money from Americans by means of parliamentary taxation and to employ it against their liberties by making colonial governors and judges independent of the assemblies.\\"Miller, Origins, 255. Some members of Parliament objected because Townshend's plan was expected to generate only ¬£40,000 in yearly revenue, but he explained that once the precedent for taxing the colonists had been firmly established, the program could gradually be expanded until the colonies paid for themselves.Chaffin, \\"Townshend Acts\\", 128; Thomas, Duties Crisis, 30. According to historian Peter Thomas, Townshend's \\"aims were political rather than financial\\".Thomas, Duties Crisis, 30. =American Board of Customs Commissioners= To better collect the new taxes, the Commissioners of Customs Act 1767 established the American Board of Customs Commissioners, which was modeled on the British Board of Customs.Knollenberg, Growth, 47. The Board was created because of the difficulties the British Board faced in enforcing trade regulations in the distant colonies.Thomas, Duties Crisis, 33 Five commissioners were appointed to the board, which was headquartered in Boston.Chaffin, \\"Townshend Acts\\", 130. The American Customs Board would generate considerable hostility in the colonies towards the British government. According to historian Oliver Dickerson, \\"The actual separation of the continental colonies from the rest of the Empire dates from the creation of this independent administrative board.\\"Dickerson, Navigation Acts, 199. The American Board of Customs Commissioners was notoriously corrupt, according to historians. Political scientist Peter Andreas argues: :merchants resented not only the squeeze on smuggling but also the exploits by unscrupulous customs agents that came with it. Such \\"customs racketeering\\" was, in the view of colonial merchants, essentially legalized piracy.Peter Andreas, Smuggler Nation: How Illicit Trade Made America (2012) p 34 Historian Edmund Morgan says: :In the establishment of this American Board of Customs Commissioners, Americans saw the extension of England's corrupt system of officeholding to America. As Professor Dickerson has shown, the Commissioners were indeed corrupt. They engaged in extensive \\"customs racketeering\\" and they were involved in many of the episodes of heightened the tension between England and the colonies: it was on their request that troops were sent to Boston; The Boston Massacre took place before their headquarters; the \\"Gaspee\\" was operating under their orders. Historian Doug Krehbiel argues: :Disputes brought to the board were almost exclusively resolved in favor of the British government. Vice admiralty courts claimed to prosecute vigorously smugglers but were widely corrupt‚Äîcustoms officials falsely accused ship owners of possessing undeclared items, thereby seizing the cargoes of entire vessels, and justices of the juryless courts were entitled to a percentage of the goods from colonial ships that they ruled unlawful. Writs of assistance and blanket search warrants to search for smuggled goods were liberally abused. John Hancock, the wealthy New England merchant, had his ship \\"Liberty\\" seized in 1768 on a false charge, incensing the colonists. Charges against Hancock were later dropped and his ship returned because of the fear that he would appeal to more scrupulous customs officials in Britain.Doug Krehbiel, \\"British Empire and the Atlantic World,\\" in Paul Finkelman, ed., Encyclopedia of the New American Nation (2005) 1:228 Another measure to enforce the trade laws was the Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768.8 Geo. III ch. 22. Although often included in discussions of the Townshend Acts, this act was initiated by the Cabinet when Townshend was not present, and was not passed until after his death.Thomas, Duties Crisis, 34‚Äì35. Before this act, there was just one vice admiralty court in North America, located in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Established in 1764, this court proved to be too remote to serve all of the colonies, and so the 1768 Vice Admiralty Court Act created four district courts, which were located at Halifax, Boston, Philadelphia, and Charleston. One purpose of the vice admiralty courts, which did not have juries, was to help customs officials prosecute smugglers, since colonial juries were reluctant to convict persons for violating unpopular trade regulations. Townshend also faced the problem of what to do about the New York Provincial Assembly, which had refused to comply with the 1765 Quartering Act because its members saw the act's financial provisions as levying an unconstitutional tax.Chaffin, \\"Townshend Acts\\", 134. The New York Restraining Act,7 Geo. III ch. 59. Also known as the New York Suspending Act; Knollenberg, Growth, 296. which according to historian Robert Chaffin was \\"officially a part of the Townshend Acts\\",Chaffin, \\"Townshend Acts\\", 128. suspended the power of the Assembly until it complied with the Quartering Act. The Restraining Act never went into effect because, by the time it was passed, the New York Assembly had already appropriated money to cover the costs of the Quartering Act. The Assembly avoided conceding the right of Parliament to tax the colonies by making no reference to the Quartering Act when appropriating this money; they also passed a resolution stating that Parliament could not constitutionally suspend an elected legislature.Chaffin, \\"Townshend Acts\\", 134‚Äì35. Reaction Townshend knew that his program would be controversial in the colonies, but he argued that, \\"The superiority of the mother country can at no time be better exerted than now.\\"Chaffin, \\"Townshend Acts\\", 131. The Townshend Acts did not create an instant uproar like the Stamp Act had done two years earlier, but before long, opposition to the programme had become widespread.Knollenberg, Growth, 48; Thomas, Duties Crisis, 76. Townshend did not live to see this reaction, having died suddenly on September 4, 1767.Thomas, Duties Crisis, 36. Dickinson's Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania The most influential colonial response to the Townshend Acts was a series of twelve essays by John Dickinson entitled \\"Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania\\", which began appearing in December 1767.Chaffin, \\"Townshend Acts\\", 132. Eloquently articulating ideas already widely accepted in the colonies, Dickinson argued that there was no difference between \\"internal\\" and \\"external\\" taxes, and that any taxes imposed on the colonies by Parliament for the sake of raising a revenue were unconstitutional.Knollenberg, Growth, 50. Dickinson warned colonists not to concede to the taxes just because the rates were low, since this would set a dangerous precedent.Knollenberg, Growth, 52‚Äì53. Dickinson sent a copy of his \\"Letters\\" to James Otis of Massachusetts, informing Otis that \\"whenever the Cause of American Freedom is to be vindicated, I look towards the Province of Massachusetts Bay\\".Knollenberg, Growth, 54. Dickinson's letter to Otis was dated December 5, 1767. The Massachusetts House of Representatives began a campaign against the Townshend Acts by first sending a petition to King George asking for the repeal of the Revenue Act, and then sending a letter to the other colonial assemblies, asking them to join the resistance movement.Knollenberg, Growth, 54. Upon receipt of the Massachusetts Circular Letter, other colonies also sent petitions to the king.Thomas, Duties Crisis, 84; Knollenberg, Growth, 54‚Äì57. Virginia and Pennsylvania also sent petitions to Parliament, but the other colonies did not, believing that it might have been interpreted as an admission of Parliament's sovereignty over them.Thomas, Duties Crisis, 85, 111‚Äì12. Parliament refused to consider the petitions of Virginia and Pennsylvania.Thomas, Duties Crisis, 112. In Great Britain, Lord Hillsborough, who had recently been appointed to the newly created office of Colonial Secretary, was alarmed by the actions of the Massachusetts House. In April 1768 he sent a letter to the colonial governors in America, instructing them to dissolve the colonial assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also sent a letter to Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard, instructing him to have the Massachusetts House rescind the Circular Letter. By a vote of 92 to 17, the House refused to comply, and Bernard promptly dissolved the legislature.Thomas, Duties Crisis, 81; Knollenberg, Growth, 56. =Boycotts= Non-importation agreement, dated October 1767, signed by Bostonians including Paul Revere Merchants in the colonies, some of them smugglers, organized economic boycotts to put pressure on their British counterparts to work for repeal of the Townshend Acts. Boston merchants organized the first non-importation agreement, which called for merchants to suspend importation of certain British goods effective 1 January 1768. Merchants in other colonial ports, including New York City and Philadelphia, eventually joined the boycott.Knollenberg, Growth, 57‚Äì58. In Virginia, the non-importation effort was organized by George Washington and George Mason. When the Virginia House of Burgesses passed a resolution stating that Parliament had no right to tax Virginians without their consent, Governor Lord Botetourt dissolved the assembly. The members met at Raleigh Tavern and adopted a boycott agreement known as the \\"Association\\".Knollenberg, Growth, 59. The non-importation movement was not as effective as promoters had hoped. British exports to the colonies declined by 38 percent in 1769, but there were many merchants who did not participate in the boycott.Thomas, Duties Crisis, 157. The boycott movement began to fail by 1770, and came to an end in 1771.Chaffin, \\"Townshend Acts\\", 138. =Unrest in Boston= alt=A wide view of a port town with several wharves. In the foreground there are eight large sailing ships and an assortment of smaller vessels. Soldiers are disembarking from small boats onto a long wharf. The skyline of the town, with nine tall spires and many smaller buildings, is in the distance. A key at the bottom of the drawing indicates some prominent landmarks and the names of the warships. The newly created American Customs Board was seated in Boston, and so it was there that the Board concentrated on strictly enforcing the Townshend Acts.Knollenberg, Growth, 61‚Äì63. The acts were so unpopular in Boston that the Customs Board requested naval and military assistance. Commodore Samuel Hood complied by sending the fifty-gun warship HMS Romney, which arrived in Boston Harbor in May 1768.Knollenberg, Growth, 63. On June 10, 1768, customs officials seized the Liberty, a sloop owned by leading Boston merchant John Hancock, on allegations that the ship had been involved in smuggling. Bostonians, already angry because the captain of the Romney had been impressing local sailors, began to riot. Customs officials fled to Castle William for protection. With John Adams serving as his lawyer, Hancock was prosecuted in a highly publicized trial by a vice-admiralty court, but the charges were eventually dropped.\\"Notorious Smuggler\\", 236‚Äì46; Knollenberg, Growth, 63‚Äì65. Given the unstable state of affairs in Massachusetts, Hillsborough instructed Governor Bernard to try to find evidence of treason in Boston.Thomas, Duties Crisis, 109. Parliament had determined that the Treason Act 1543 was still in force, which would allow Bostonians to be transported to England to stand trial for treason. Bernard could find no one who was willing to provide reliable evidence, however, and so there were no treason trials.Jensen, Founding, 296‚Äì97. The possibility that American colonists might be arrested and sent to England for trial produced alarm and outrage in the colonies.Knollenberg, Growth, 69. Even before the Liberty riot, Hillsborough had decided to send troops to Boston. On 8 June 1768, he instructed General Thomas Gage, Commander-in-Chief, North America, to send \\"such Force as You shall think necessary to Boston\\", although he conceded that this might lead to \\"consequences not easily foreseen\\".Thomas, Duties Crisis, 82; Knollenberg, Growth, 75; Jensen, Founding, 290. Hillsborough suggested that Gage might send one regiment to Boston, but the Liberty incident convinced officials that more than one regiment would be needed.Reid, Rebellious Spirit, 125. People in Massachusetts learned in September 1768 that troops were on the way.Thomas, Duties Crisis, 92. Samuel Adams organized an emergency, extralegal convention of towns and passed resolutions against the imminent occupation of Boston, but on 1 October 1768, the first of four regiments of the British Army began disembarking in Boston, and the Customs Commissioners returned to town.Knollenberg, Growth, 76. The \\"Journal of Occurrences\\", an anonymously written series of newspaper articles, chronicled clashes between civilians and soldiers during the military occupation of Boston, apparently with some exaggeration.Knollenberg, Growth, 76‚Äì77. Tensions rose after Christopher Seider, a Boston teenager, was killed by a customs employee on 22 February 1770.Knollenberg, Growth, 77‚Äì78. Although British soldiers were not involved in that incident, resentment against the occupation escalated in the days that followed, resulting in the killing of five civilians in the Boston Massacre of 5 March 1770.Knollenberg, Growth, 78‚Äì79. After the incident, the troops were withdrawn to Castle William.Knollenberg, Growth, 81. Partial repeal On the 5th of March 1770‚Äî the same day as the Boston Massacre although news traveled slowly at the time, and neither side of the Atlantic were aware of this coincidence‚ÄîLord North, the new Prime Minister, presented a motion in the House of Commons that called for partial repeal of the Townshend Revenue Act.Knollenberg, Growth, 71. Although some in Parliament advocated a complete repeal of the act, North disagreed, arguing that the tea duty should be retained to assert \\"the right of taxing the Americans\\". After debate, the Repeal Act10 Geo. III c. 17; Labaree, Tea Party, 276n17. received the Royal Assent on 12 April 1770.Knollenberg, Growth, 72. Historian Robert Chaffin argued that little had actually changed: > It would be inaccurate to claim that a major part of the Townshend Acts had > been repealed. The revenue-producing tea levy, the American Board of Customs > and, most important, the principle of making governors and magistrates > independent all remained. In fact, the modification of the Townshend Duties > Act was scarcely any change at all.Chaffin, \\"Townshend Acts\\", 140. The Townshend duty on tea was retained when the 1773 Tea Act was passed, which allowed the East India Company to ship tea directly to the colonies. The Boston Tea Party soon followed, which set the stage for the American Revolution. NotesReferences * Chaffin, Robert J. \\"The Townshend Acts crisis, 1767‚Äì1770\\".

The Saban-produced Mon Colle Knights aired on Fox Kids in North America from July 2001 to September 2002, consisting of 45 episodes. In 2006, it aired in reruns on Toon Disney's Jetix on Sundays, as part of Jetix's \\"Anime Invasion Sundays\\" block. The manga is published in English in Singapore by Chuang Yi. On June 9, 2020, the original Japanese version became available on Crunchyroll via Discotek Media. According to Justin Sevakis, the only reason why the anime is only available on Crunchyroll in Japanese is that the masters for the English dub couldn't be found.https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2020-06-11/discotek-turns-to- community-for-help-locating-mon-kolle-knights-medabots-english-dub- masters/.160491 Discotek Media is currently asking fans to help find the masters. They are still searching for it as of September 15, 2020.https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-09-15/discotek-schedules-gin- rei-ova-in-late-2020-early-2021/.164022 Plot The series features Mondo Ooya and his classmate/girlfriend Rockna Hiiragi (Rokuna in the Japanese version), whose scientist father Professor Ichiroubei Hiiragi invented a way to travel to Mon World (Roku Mon Sekai: the Six Gate World), where all sorts of magical creatures live. Together, they try to find six monster items which, when combined, could connect the Six Gate World with planet Earth for the better of both worlds. Rokuna and Mondo form the Mon Colle Knights and find out that when chanting a phrase-(\\"With us, you can do it!\\") they can merge into monsters and control them into battle as well as aid with spells. Almost every episode, they battle Professor Hiiragi's rival Prince Eccentro (Count Collection in the Japanese version) and his two girl underlings Gluko and Batch (Goruko and Bachi in the Japanese version) who are after the same thing as the Mon Colle Knights, except that they intend to use the items to dominate both worlds. Main characters=Mon Colle Knights= * : :: One of the main protagonists of the series and is an elementary school student at a local public school. Mondo is an adventurous young boy who seeks to gather the Mon items to bring together his world and Mon world for peace and friendship. Even though he has an outgoing and determined nature, Mondo has a little problem: he always flirts with pretty girls (Beginner, Kahimi, and Lailai are the most notable). Note that the first Kanji in Mondo's name; \\",\\" is the same that is used in the Mon Colle Knights title, . He has devices that he uses for his peace sign attack. * / Rockna Hiiragi : :: One of the main protagonists of the series. Rokuna is Mondo's genius friend and classmate from school, whose intentions match Mondo's. She has a special telepathic ability to communicate with monsters. Now her boyfriend Mondo likes drooling over her but she gets jealous if Mondo flirts with other girls causing Rokuna to attack him. The first Kanji in Rockna's name; \\",\\" is the same that is used in the Mon Colle Knights title, . She has a baton like devices which she uses for her string or ribbon attack. * : :: Rokuna's father and a rather eccentric sort of mad scientist. He discovered Mon World and wants the human world to know about it so he can win lots of awards. His laboratory is right across the street from Mondo and Rokuna's school. * / Lovestar : :: Lovestar is a Zeechi that Rokuna adopted. A pale pink hamster-like monster with a red star marked on her back. In the Japanese version, his species is called \\"Lovestar\\" because the sounds the creatures make resemble the word \\"love-love\\" and the pattern on their backs make a star. Also in the Japanese version, Lovestar is called \\"JƒÅne,\\" because, when Rokuna was trying to say goodbye (\\"JƒÅ ne\\") to him, Lovestar thought she was calling him by name. * : :: A tiny monkey monster who punches. * Cluckputer :: Professor Hiiragi's chicken-based super computer. It usually serves as a computer for Professor Hiiragi and goes off by making chicken noises whenever a monster is nearby. =Collection team= * / Prince Ludwig Von Monsterstein Eccentro : :: One of the principal antagonists of the series. Prince Eccentro is a young effeminate aristocrat from Europe who wants to take over Mon World. He was born in 1974 and he was trained by Tanaka when his father wanted him to be a bad guy. He is not very threatening due to his eccentric behavior and hysterical persona at times. However, he is the inventor of the hypnotic Skeitso Beam (whether on his Flying Lion aircraft or Teddyarenaut) which he uses to bend monsters to his will. Because of that, he tends to have his evil moments, though he really isn't as evil as he brags himself to be. Everytime Prince Eccentro fails, Tanaka would punish him with back-breaking exercises and/or harsh training that is related to the episode's content. His dream is apparently to become a world famous belly dancer. * Teddyarenaut :: A bear-like computer created by Eccentro. He serves as the counterpart to the Cluckputer and has a built-in Skeitso Beam. In one episode, he temporarily developed an A.I. because Savant Bear thought he was their king. * / Batch : :: Eccentro's tomboyish lackey. She unfortunately gets punished by Tanaka as well except in two episodes. Batch and Eccentro argue a lot, but she always obeys him. * / Gluko : :: Eccentro's big-breasted, yet air-headed and friendly underling. She is always spared by Tanaka when it's time for punishment and has an amount of luck. Goruko never seems to get hurt while the rest of her team and the Mon Colle Knights usually does. An English ongoing joke in the series is that during Eccentro's launch sequence in each episode, she asks a very long and logic based question which ends with Eccentro and Batch becoming bored and saying \\"Never mind, Goruko.\\" In the Japanese version, Gluko speaks in a very polite and respectful dialect whether she's talking to her teammates or her enemies. Goruko also carries around a book detailing about Mon World and his creatures. In a later episode, Gluko ends up adopting a Forest Imp named Impy. * / Tanaka : :: A midget old man who serves as Eccentro's mentor under the orders of Eccentro's father. He usually punishes Eccentro for his screw ups (and/or lack of manly attitude) with back- breaking exercises and/or harsh training related to the episode's content. Tanaka tends to pop up anywhere. * / Impy : :: A cheerful young Forest Imp (Leprechaun in the Japanese version) who is Goruko's pet. Goruko first found him in the forest near where Vipress was imprisoned. Impy doesn't talk very much  he usually only utters short, inquisitive questions (such as \\"What this?\\"), or repeats cheerfully what Goruko says. He has psychic powers that allow him to telekinetically move things around, which comes in handy for some of Eccentro's schemes. Impy also has a habit of fiddling with buttons on the Flying Lion aircraft and more often than not causing it to explode and send him and his allies blasting off. Despite his apparent carefree and dimwitted personality, Impy does care a lot for Goruko. =Supporting cast= * / Naomi Loon : :: Mondo and Rokuna's teacher, a rather nice lady who has a short temper and terrible luck with love. For some reason, there is a monster card featuring her that is in Prince Eccentro's possession. She is a skilled fighter as seen in some episodes. * : :: A cute but accident-prone girl with a large appetite who is learning to become a summoner. While powerful, her aim is terrible, so she tends to hurt her allies by accident. As a running gag, she has a habit of summoning a giant meteor that always ends destroying something. She is a friend of Mondo and Rokuna. Her grandfather, Expert, runs the summoning school she attends. In the Japanese version, Beginner refers to Mondo and Rokuna collectively as \\"Roku-Mon-chan,\\" much to their annoyance. * : :: A young girl which the Mon Colle Knights often encounter at random, while she travels the world carrying impossible amounts of little monsters in her coat. She gave Lovestar to Rokuna. * / Kahimi : ::An elf maiden with very long hair, whose beauty incites Rokuna's jealousy whenever Mondo compliments Kahimi (though Rokuna holds nothing against Kahimi herself). She becomes a good friend and ally of the Mon Colle Knights, especially with her ability to make plants grow and control over the winds of Mon World. * : :: A friend of Beginner's who goes to the same summoning school as her. Luke has a poorly- disguised crush on Beginner and seems to like Rokuna. Luke is a summoning prodigy and considers Mondo his biggest rival as a monster summoner and for Beginner's heart. Around Beginner, Luke becomes so nervous he can summon only purple sheep, not to be confused with his own sheep friend, Lambda. Beginner, for her part, is oblivious to Luke's crush on her. Luke acts rather stingy and aloof towards strangers and he tends to be a bit of a crybaby when things don't go his way  such as when someone, usually Mondo, interacts with Beginner or Lambda  but he shows himself to quite brave in the face of danger, and his summoning abilities make him handy to have around. Prince Eccentro once lied to Luke telling him that Mondo is not a very good person causing Luke to summon Basilosaurus to attack Mondo with. Luke learned the truth when Prince Eccentro took over Basilosaurus. * :: A purple sheep who is a friend of Luke's. * / Gabriolis : :: A former Light Angel. During a great war between good and evil, he was wounded and left behind by his friend Lark. He felt betrayed and abandoned and embraced the darkness that Redda offered him transforming him into a Dark Angel. He plagued the Mon Colle Knights on different occasions involving attacking Doppelganger and casting a spell on 3 of Mondo's cards (consisting of Forester the Forest Giant, Flying Stego, and Scorch the Fire Monster) until Spectra appeared and reversed the spell. When he was weakened by Vipress's attack during his fight with Mondo and Water Dragon after Redda took control of the monsters, it was later revealed by Spectra and the Angel of all Oceans that Lark, in fact, took his place in battle and died (in the English dub, he went to divert an approaching enemy flock and wasn't seen again) after which Gabriolis realized his error and reverted to good, though maintaining his dark appearance. He also helped Mondo and Rockna defeat Dread Dragon and destroyed Redda in the final episode. Zaha's name is derived from Zahariel, which means \\"Brightness of God\\". Zahariel was the angel who would help people resist temptation. This is both ironic and fitting to his character, as he would first failed to resist temptation, then become someone who temps others, then turns into someone who helps others resist temptation, and finally become someone who is able to resist it himself too. The English dubbed name is derived from Gabriel, one of the archangels who typically serves as a messenger to humans from God. * / Lucca :: He is a small demonic creature who is Gabriolis' friend and partner. On one occasion, he had possession of an item that had to be won over in a Mon World Baseball tournament. * : :: One of the principal antagonists of the series. Redda is a fallen angel like Gabriolis, who wants to use the six items to summon Oroboros. He is powerful, but not the strongest. Redda would prefer to avoid battle when not having a good advantage. In the dub, he wants to create a world of nothingness. In the original, he wants to create a formless world where all souls are the same and neither good nor evil will exist. Redda was the one who enabled Gabriolis to embrace the darkness after he was seemingly abandoned. In the final battle, he is killed by Gabriolis. * N-Nouncer :: A man with a circle that has the letter N on it. He serves as the announcer of any tournaments in Mon World. * / Spectra the Angel : :: Lark's sister and Zaha's fiance in the Japanese version (she is Gabriolis' sister in the English dub) who sports a long gold dress and is always barefoot. Spectra is a Light Angel who comes to Gabriolis in his darkest hour to show him what really happened in the past so he may find redemption. She reappeared when Redda was chasing after her near the Fire Angel's castle and was rescued by the Mon Colle Knights. * Forest Angel / Earth Angel :: Mon World's guardian angel of the Earth Realm who sports five pairs of wings. She first appeared to help the Mon Colle Knights put the Four-Armed Giant back to sleep by summoning the Emerald Dragon. It was the Forest Angel who told the Mon Colle Knights of the Guardian Angels' roles. * Flame Angel / Fire Angel : :: The guardian angel of the Fire Realm and the Guardian of the Solar Scepter (one of the Mon items). * Angel of all Oceans / Water Angel : :: The guardian angel of the Water Realm and Guardian of the Arialla Pearl (one of the Mon items) who sports long purple hair, three wings, wears a strange dress, and is always barefoot. The Angel of all Oceans and Spectra revealed to Gabriolis what really happened the day when he was \\"abandoned.\\" * Cloud Angel :: Mon World's guardian angel of the Wind Realm who sports two pairs of wings.

It was first broadcast on BBC TV in seven weekly parts from 22 February to 4 April 1964. It was written by John Lucarotti and directed largely by Waris Hussein; John Crockett directed the fourth episode. The story is set in China in the year 1289, where the Doctor (William Hartnell), his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford), and her teachers Ian Chesterton (William Russell) and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) meet the Italian merchant-explorer Marco Polo (Mark Eden) and Mongolian Emperor Kublai Khan (Martin Miller). Lucarotti‚Äîwho had previously written works based on Marco Polo's adventures‚Äîwas suggested to producers by Doctor Who creator Sydney Newman when the show was early in development. Throughout production, the script was rewritten to make the story more personal to Polo. Barry Newbery, the serial's designer, used several historical books for research of the old designs, taking inspiration from 1900 Korean architecture. The serial premiered with nine million viewers, and maintained audience figures throughout its seven-week run. It received generally positive responses from critics and was sold widely overseas, but was erased by the BBC in 1967; the entire serial is missing as a result. The serial received later print adaptations, and soundtrack releases based on the surviving audio.  Plot  The TARDIS crew lands in the Pamir Mountains of the Himalayas in 1289, their ship badly damaged, and are picked up by Marco Polo's (Mark Eden) caravan on its way along the fabled Silk Road to see the Emperor Kublai Khan (Martin Miller). The story concerns the First Doctor (William Hartnell), his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and her teachers Ian Chesterton (William Russell) and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill), and their attempts to thwart the machinations of Tegana (Derren Nesbitt), who attempts to sabotage the caravan along its travels through the Pamir Plateau and across the treacherous Gobi Desert, and ultimately to assassinate Kublai Khan in Peking, at the height of his imperial power. The Doctor and his companions also attempt to regain the TARDIS, which Marco Polo has taken to give to Kublai Khan in effort to regain the Emperor's good graces. Susan gets the TARDIS key from Ping-Cho (Zienia Merton) but is captured by Tegana before they can depart. They are finally able to thwart Tegana, who kills himself before he can be executed, restoring the Emperor's respect for Marco Polo, and the Emperor allows them to depart.  Production = Conception and writing = The serial features the Italian merchant and explorer Marco Polo, as well as some of his friends and associates. Show creator Sydney Newman suggested writer John Lucarotti, an old colleague from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, to the production team during the show's early development. Story editor David Whitaker contacted Lucarotti to write for the programme; Lucarotti, who had recently worked on the 18-part radio serial The Three Journeys of Marco Polo (1955), was commissioned on 9 July 1963 to write a seven-part serial about Italian merchant and explorer Marco Polo, titled Dr Who and a Journey to Cathay. While developing the storyline Lucarotti struggled with the fourth episode, and used anecdotal material from Polo's memoirs, The Travels of Marco Polo, to pad out the plot. The serial was originally placed third in the show's running order, to begin broadcast on 18 January 1964, but was pushed back to fourth to accommodate the two-part \\"filler\\" serial The Edge of Destruction. Waris Hussein, who worked on the show's first serial, was selected as the director for Marco Polo; John Crockett directed the fourth episode in Hussein's absence. The serial's designer, Barry Newbery, used Aurel Stein's Ruins of Desert Cathay (1912) and Nelson Ikon Wu's Chinese and Indian Architecture (1963) for research of the 13th century designs. Newbery also found that Korean architecture from 1900 was similar to that of the 13th century. The incidental music for the serial was composed by Tristram Cary, who previously worked on The Daleks. Cary used conventional instruments for the score, including flute, harp and percussion, and he recorded electronic voices for the second episode's sandstorm scenes. = Casting and characters = Mark Eden was cast as Marco Polo; Hussein had seen Eden in the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of A Penny for a Song in 1962. While the serial's narration was originally scripted for the Doctor, Ian and Barbara, Hussein decided to make the story more personal to Polo, and the narration was rewritten for Eden. Derren Nesbitt, who had appeared in several historical film series in the 1950s, was cast as Tegana. For the role of Ping-Cho, Hussein wanted an \\"oriental\\" actress who had not appeared in the West End production of The World of Suzie Wong or the film 55 Days at Peking (1963), due to the prominence of those productions. Actress Zienia Merton auditioned at Hussein's home, and was offered the role. William Russell was unhappy with sudden rewrites minimising the role of his character, Ian Chesterton, in the serial, and his agent wrote to BBC's head of serials Donald Wilson; Wilson replied to Russell's agent, assuring that he would \\"be watching very carefully\\" to ensure the scripts \\"use [Russell's] talents to the maximum\\". The fifth episode featured an untrained spider monkey, which the cast found difficult to work with; Carole Ann Ford recalled that \\"it was a nasty little thing peeing all over the place and biting anyone who came near it\\". = Filming = A week of shooting took place at Ealing Studios from 13 to 17 January 1964, consisting mostly of inserts of locations and props for the montage sequences. Rehearsals for the first episode ran from 27 to 30 January, and the episodes were recorded weekly at Lime Grove Studio D from 31 January to 13 March. When William Hartnell became ill in the first week of February, quick rewrites were performed on the second episode to eliminate the Doctor from most scenes; Hartnell only had one line of dialogue in the episode. For the sandstorm in the second episode, a wind machine was used, with other footage superimposed on top; Hussein was unhappy with the effectiveness of the effect, later stating that \\"it looked like everyone's aerials had blown over\\". Merton recalled the wind machine blowing sawdust into her eyes, rendering her unable to see for the rest of the scene. During camera rehearsals for the sixth episode, Eden's right hand was accidentally lacerated by a dagger used by Nesbitt.  Reception = Broadcast and ratings = The first episode was broadcast on BBC TV on 22 February 1964, and was watched by 9.4 million viewers. The following two episodes maintained the same viewing figures, rising to 9.9 million for the fourth episode, before dropping to 9.4 million for the fifth and 8.4 million for the sixth; from the sixth episode, the show's broadcast time was pushed a further fifteen minutes, from 5:15pm to 5:30pm, overlapping with competitor programme ITN News. The final episode was watched by 10.4 million viewers. The Appreciation Index dropped slightly across the seven episodes, from 63 to 59. The serial was sold widely overseas, but was erased by the BBC on 17 August 1967; the entire serial is missing as a result. It is one of three stories of which no footage whatsoever is known to have survived, though tele-snaps (images of the show during transmission, photographed from a television) of episodes 1‚Äì3 and 5‚Äì7 exist, and were subsequently released with the original audio soundtrack, which was recorded \\"off air\\" during the original transmission. = Critical response = The serial received positive reviews from television critics and viewers. Following the broadcast of the first episode, the BBC Programme Review Board noted that there were \\"several appreciative notes\\" on the show. Philip Purser of The Sunday Telegraph noted that Eden impersonated Marco Polo \\"with sartorial dash\\", but felt that the main characters were poorly written, describing Barbara as \\"a persistent drip\\". In a 2008 review, Mark Braxton of Radio Times praised the serial, stating that \\"the historical landscape was rarely mapped with such poetry and elegance\\", though he noted inconsistencies in the foreign characters' accents. In Doctor Who: The Complete History, editor John Ainsworth described the serial as \\"exotic and arresting\\", praising the simplicity of the narrative and the exploration of the characters. The serial also gained the attention of two sources for further development: in June 1964, Young World Publications showed interest in adapting the serial for the Super Mag comic series, but were turned down as the comic rights had been sold to TV Comic; and in July 1964, The Walt Disney Company approached the BBC for the film rights to Marco Polo, though no developments were made. Commercial releases=In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Lucarotti based on his original scripts, was published in hardback by W. H. Allen & Co. in December 1984, with a cover painting by David McAllister; the paperback was published by Target Books in April 1985. A three-CD set of the audio soundtrack was released in November 2003, as part of the show's 40th anniversary, with linking narration by William Russell and a fold-out map of Polo's journey. This was later re-released as part of Doctor Who: The Lost TV Episodes: Collection One in August 2010 by AudioGO, along with the original camera scripts of the episodes. An audiobook of Lucarotti's novel was released in December 2018, narrated by Zienia Merton in her final professional engagement before her death. =Home media= A condensed 30-minute reconstruction of the serial, compiled by Derek Handley using telesnaps, photographs and the off-air soundtrack recording, was released as a special feature on the DVD release of The Edge of Destruction, as part of the Doctor Who: The Beginning box set, on 30 January 2006. The telesnaps were also published in a Doctor Who Magazine special edition, The Missing Episodes ‚Äì The First Doctor, in March 2013.

The battle pitted the forces of Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, against Hussite forces under command of Jan ≈Ωi≈æka (in English, John Zizka). V√≠tkov Hill was located on the edge of the city of Prague and the battle occurred in a vineyard established by Sigismund's father, Charles IV. It ended with a decisive Hussite victory. Preliminaries to the battle On 1 March 1420 Pope Martin V published a papal bull in which he ordered that Sigismund and all Eastern princes had to organize a crusade against the Hussite followers of Jan Hus, John Wycliffe and other heretics. On 15 March in Wroc≈Çaw, Emperor Sigismund ordered the execution of Jan Kr√°sa, a Hussite and leader of the Wroc≈Çaw Uprising in 1418. On 17 March papal legate Ferdinand de Palacios published the bull in Wroc≈Çaw. After that the Utraquist faction of Hussites understood that they would not reach agreement with him. They united with Taborite Hussites and decided to defend against the emperor. The crusaders assembled their army in ≈öwidnica. On 4 April Taborite forces destroyed Catholic forces in Mlad√° Vo≈æice. On 7 April Taborites under command of Nicholas of Hus captured Sedlice, after which they captured P√≠sek, the castle R√°b√≠, Strakonice and Prachatice. At the end of April the crusading army crossed the Bohemian border. At the beginning of May they captured Hradec Kr√°lov√©. On 7 May ƒåenƒõk of Wartenberg surrounded Hradƒçany. =Battles in Bene≈°ov and near Kutn√° Hora= The Crusader force of 400 infantry and knights under the command of Peter of Sternberg attempted to defend Bene≈°ov against the Taborites. After the battle, the crusader forces were destroyed and the town was burned. Near Kutn√° Hora the crusader forces under the command of Janek z Chtƒõnic and Pippo Spano (Filippo Scolari) attacked the formations of the Taborites, without success. On 22 May Taborite forces entered Prague. Jan ≈Ωi≈æka destroyed the crusaders' relief column, which had to secure supplies that were sent to Hradƒçany and Vy≈°ehrad. Meanwhile, the crusading army captured Slan√Ω, Louny and Mƒõln√≠k. Defence of Prague After the Battle of V√≠tkov Hill (1923), by Alphonse Mucha, The Slav Epic Jan ≈Ωi≈æka with a priest looking over Prague at the V√≠tkov Hill. The siege began on 12 June. The crusaders' forces, in the opinions of the chroniclers, consisted of 100,000-200,000 soldiers (according to Victor Verney, a modern historian, they probably had 80,000 soldiers). One of the most important points in the fortifications of Prague was V√≠tkov Hill. The fortifications on this hill secured roads on the crusaders' supply lines and were made from timber but were consolidated with a stone-and-clay wall and moats. On the southern part of the hill there was a standing tower and the northern part was secured by a steep cliff. The fortifications were said to be defended by 26 men and three women, though in the opinion of J. Durdik it was probably about 60 soldiers. On 13 July the crusaders' cavalry crossed the River Vltava and began their attack. The next day Hussite relief troops surprise-attacked the knights through the vineyards on the southern side of the hill on which the battle was fought. The attack forced the crusaders down the steep northern cliff. Panic spread among them, which resulted in their rout from the field. During the retreat many knights drowned in the Vltava. Most of ≈Ωi≈æka's forces were soldiers armed with flails and guns. The battle was a clear victory for the Hussites. Crusaders lost between 400-500 knights. In honor of this battle, V√≠tkov Hill was renamed ≈Ωi≈ækov after Jan ≈Ωi≈æka. As a consequence of the Hussite victory on V√≠tkov, the crusaders lost any hope of starving the city into submission and their army disintegrated. The National Monument exists today on the hill and in 2003 local officials were attempting to replant the vineyard. Sigismund and his troops then held the castles of Vy≈°ehrad and Hradƒçany. However, they soon capitulated and Sigismund had to withdraw from Prague. Afterward the crusaders withdrew to Kutn√° Hora and began local warfare.

Just before his death, the prophet Elisha predicted: :\\"The arrow of the Lord‚Äôs deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from Syria; for you must strike the Syrians at Aphek till you have destroyed them.\\" *A place at which the Bible states that the Philistines had encamped, while the Israelites pitched in Eben-Ezer, before the Battle of Aphek in which the sons of Eli were killed (I Samuel 4:1‚Äìff.) *A city of the Tribe of Issachar, near to Jezreel, in the north of the Sharon plain.

Location Since the turn of the 20th century the predominant opinion was that the location of all these battles is one and the same, and that the town lay east of the Jordan. Initially it was thought that the name is preserved in the now depopulated village of Fiq near Kibbutz Afik, three miles east of the Sea of Galilee, where an ancient mound, Tell Soreg, had been identified. Excavations by Moshe Kochavi and Pirhiya Beck in 1987-88 have indeed discovered a fortified 9th- and 8th-century BCE settlement, probably Aramean, but Kochavi considered it to be too small to serve the role ascribed to Aphek in the Bible.The Golan Heights: A Battlefield of the Ages, LA Times, 11 September 1988Shuichi Hasegawa, Aram and Israel during the Jehuite Dynasty, Tel Soreg, p 72 The site most favoured now by the archaeologists is Tel 'En Gev/Khirbet el-'Asheq, a mound located within Kibbutz Ein Gev. A more recent theory has focused on regarding this same Aphek also as the scene of the two battles against the Philistines mentioned by the Bible - the supposition being that the Syrians were invading Israel from the western side, which was their most vulnerable. Since most scholars agree that there were more than one Aphek, C.R. Conder identified the Aphek of Eben-Ezer The account in of the battle at Aphek and Eben-ezer with a ruin (Khirbet) some distant from Dayr Aban (believed to be Eben-Ezer), and known by the name Marj al-Fikiya; the name al-Fikiya being an Arabic corruption of Aphek.

This film earned an honorable mention in the Spirit of Slamdance category at the 2002 Slamdance Film Festival and is considered a cult film.  Plot summary  After a spree of vampire attacks on lesbians, a Catholic priest (Father Eustace) realizes that only Jesus Christ can fight off the vampires. Eustace sends two priests to a beach, where they inform Jesus of the problem. Three vampires, including Maxine Shreck, kill the priests, but Jesus kills two of the vampires by using the lake as holy water. Maxine escapes. Jesus goes to Ottawa, gets a haircut, and buys wood to make stakes. Thirty atheists jump out of a car and confront Jesus, only to be easily defeated. Jesus teams up with Mary Magnum and infiltrates the hospital, where they discover that Dr. Praetorious is performing skin transplants to make the vampires immune to sunlight. Maxine and Johnny Golgotha defeat Jesus and Mary in a rooftop battle. Thus Mary is bitten, becoming a vampire. Jesus calls upon a Mexican wrestler, El Santo, for help. At a nightclub, they slay dozens of vampires, but El Santo and his assistant are captured. The next day, Johnny, Maxine, and Mary capture Jesus and bring him to a junkyard where his allies are being held. Eustace is there, and he reveals that he is a vampire. A battle breaks out. Jesus simultaneously fights Dr. Praetorious at the hospital. The doctor is fatally wounded, but Jesus heals him. At the junkyard, Eustace stabs Jesus with a stake. A bright light emerges from the wound, killing Eustace and Johnny. El Santo shields a vampire whom he loves from the light, and Jesus cures her and Mary's vampirism. To his surprise, Mary loves Maxine, so Jesus cures her too. Later, Jesus resumes preaching. Reception Time's Richard Corliss panned the film, finding that \\"the comedy is slack, the song lyrics feeble, the pace torpid\\". Ken Eisner of Variety took a more neutral view, finding that \\"the film is too silly to offend\\". Jason Nolan of The Harrow deemed the production \\"horridly wonderful\\", although uneven, noting that \\"[w]ith a film like this, you want it to be bumpy\\".

It is commonly prepared in Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Timor (West Timor and East Timor),https://honest-food.net/portuguese-feijoada-recipe/ Goa, and Macau, where it is also considered a national dish. However, the recipe differs slightly from one country to another. Brazilian feijoada made with black beans The name comes from feij√£o, Portuguese for \\"beans\\". The basic ingredients of feijoada are beans with fresh porkMulticultural America: An Encyclopedia of the Newest Americans - Google Books p. 180. or beef. In Brazil, it is usually made with black beans (feijoada √† brasileira). The stew is best prepared over low heat in a thick clay pot. It is usually served with rice and assorted sausages such as chouri√ßo, morcela (blood sausage), farinheira, and others, which may or may not be cooked in the stew. The practice of cooking a meat (pork) stew with vegetables that gave origin to the feijoada from the Minho Province in Northern Portugal is a millenary Mediterranean tradition that can be traced back to when the Romans colonized Iberia. Roman soldiers would take this habit to every Latin settlement, i.e., all of the provinces of Romania, the Vulgar Latinspeaking area of Europe (not to be confused with the modern country solely), and this heritage is the source of many national and regional dishes of today's Europe, such as the French cassoulet, the Milanese cassoeula from Lombardy, Italy, the Romanian fasole cu c√¢rna»õi, the fabada asturiana from Northwestern Spain, and the also Spanish cocido madrile√±o and olla podrida, not to mention non-Romanic regions with similar traditions that might be derived from this millennial Roman soldiers' dish like the Polish golonka. Variants Many modern variants of the dish are based on feijoada recipes popularized in the Brazilian regions of Rio de Janeiro, S√£o Paulo, Recife, and Salvador. In Brazil, feijoada (feijoada brasileira) is often considered a national dish. =Brazilian feijoada= Registered for the first time in Recife, State of Pernambuco, feijoada has been described as a national dish of Brazil, especially of Rio de Janeiro, as other parts of Brazil have other regional dishes. The Brazilian version of feijoada (feijoada brasileira) is prepared with black beans, a variety of salted pork or beef products, such as pork trimmings (ears, tail, feet), bacon, smoked pork ribs, and at least two types of smoked sausage and jerked beef (loin and tongue). In some regions of the northeast, like Bahia and Sergipe, vegetables like cabbage, kale, potatoes, carrots, okra, pumpkin, chayote and sometimes banana are frequently added, at the end of the cooking, on top of the meat, so they are cooked by the vapors of the beans and meat stew. The final dish has the beans and meat pieces barely covered by a dark purplish-brown broth. The taste is strong, moderately salty but not spicy, dominated by black bean and meat stew flavors. It is customary to serve it with white rice and oranges, the latter to help with digestion, as well as couve, a side dish of stir-fried, chopped collard greens or kale, and a crumbly topping called farofa, made of manioc flour. Feij√£o com arroz is the rice and beans without the addition of the meat and is not considered as feijoada. A plate of feijoada in Minas Gerais with traditional accompaniments: rice, fried kale (couve), cassava flour crisps, orange slices, a mix of olive oil, alcohol vinegar, tomatoes, onions and sometimes bell peppers called vinagrete (vinaigrette), and cassava flour (farinha). Depending on the region of Brazil, the type of bean used in feijoada varies. While in some regions like Rio de Janeiro or Minas Gerais, feijoada is typically prepared with black beans, in Goias and Bahia brown or red beans are more commonly used. As a celebratory dish, feijoada is traditionally served on Saturday afternoons or Sunday lunch and intended to be a leisurely midday meal. It is meant to be enjoyed throughout the day and not eaten under rushed circumstances. The meal is usually eaten among extended family and paired with an event like watching a soccer game or other social event. Because of the dish's heavy ingredients and rich flavors, feijoada is viewed as Brazilian soul food. In the city of S√£o Paulo, feijoada is a typical dish in working-class restaurants on Wednesdays and Saturdays, mainly in the commercial area. In Rio de Janeiro, restaurants traditionally serve it on Fridays. The dish is normally served with a choice among a selection of meats, e.g. pork, bacon, pig ears, pig feet, to fulfill the customer\`s needs. Other variations of feijoada, such as the low fat version or the vegetarian. The dish is frequently compared to American Southern Soul Food, which shares many similarities in terms of ingredients and taste. According to legend, the origins of Brazil‚Äôs national dish, feijoada, stem from its history with slavery. Slaves would supposedly craft this hearty dish out of black beans and pork leftovers given to them from their households. These leftovers included pig feet, ears, tail, and other portions seen as unfit for the master and his family. However, the theory has recently been contested to be considered a modern advertising technique rather than its origin. Instead, scholars argue that the history of feijoada traces back to Brazil‚Äôs cultivation of black beans. Because of the crop‚Äôs relatively low production cost and the simplicity of its maintenance, the beans became a staple food among European settlers in Brazil. Although both the upper-classes and the poor ate black beans, the upper-classes particularly enjoyed them with an assortment of meat and vegetables, similar to feijoada. In contrast, the poor and enslaved usually ate a mixture of black beans and manioc flour.Elias, Rodrigo. \\"Feijoada: A short history of an edible institution.\\" Flavors from Brazil. Bras√≠lia: Ministry of External Relations, 2008.  Nutrition  Feijoada is traditionally consumed with orange slices as a side dish, which is likely to increase the bean's iron absorption.

He also writes music for the band along with his partner and band vocalist Sharon den Adel. He used to work in human resource management before his career with Within Temptation.  Work prior to Within Temptation  In 1992, Westerholt formed the band \\"The Circle\\" with future Within Temptation keyboard player Martijn Spierenburg, and he began writing his own music. The Circle's first demo, entitled 'Symphony No.1' was finished in December 1992. At this point, The Circle had a complete line- up, composed of Westerholt, Martijn, Jeroen van Veen (Within Temptation's bassist), Arjan Groenedijk and Ernst van der Loo, although Arjan and Ernst both left the band a while later. In a 1995 compilation album released by DSFA Records, two songs, \\"Broken Silence\\" and \\"Frozen\\" by The Circle, were featured. Soon afterward, Westerholt left The Circle, and the band was renamed as Voyage. Voyage released their only album 'Embrace' in 1995, in which Sharon den Adel collaborated on the track \\"Frozen\\".  Within Temptation  After leaving The Circle, Westerholt began writing more music for a new musical project with his girlfriend, Sharon den Adel. Westerholt sent demo versions of their songs 'Enter' and 'Candles' to former Voyage bandmate Jeroen van Veen, who then left Voyage to join Westerholt's project, along with Michiel Papenhove. Their first drummer was Richard Willemse, who left and was replaced with Dennis Leeflang, with whom Within Temptation recorded their first demo. He left soon afterward and was replaced with Ivar de Graaf. Westerholt recalls that \\"we always had a little bit of a drummer problem, leaving and coming back again...\\". By 1997, their line-up had been completed, with Sharon (vocals), Westerholt (guitars and vocals), Westerholt's brother Martijn (keyboards), Jeroen (bass), Michiel (guitar) and Ivar (drums). In the same year, Within Temptation were signed to DSFA Records and released their debut album, Enter. As of 2011, Westerholt has stepped down from touring with Within Temptation in order to take care of his and den Adel's children. He is still a recording band member, however, and will focus on songwriting and production. Stefan Helleblad, who has been working behind the scenes with the band, is his live stand-in.  Other appearances  In 1998, he had a small singing part as Death (along with George Oosthoek of Orphanage) on the Ayreon rock opera \\"Into the Electric Castle\\", on which Sharon den Adel played one of the main characters.  Personal life  Westerholt and Sharon den Adel became parents to Eva Luna on 7 December 2005 and Robin Aiden on 1 June 2009.

Computer-mediated reality has been used to enhance visual perception as an aid to the visually impaired.Video mediation This example achieves a mediated reality by altering a video input stream light that would have normally reached the user's eyes, and computationally altering it to filter it into a more useful form. It has also been used for interactive computer interfaces.

Beheading On September 10, 1945, farmer Lloyd Olsen of Fruita, Colorado, was planning to eat supper with his mother-in-law and was sent out to the yard by his wife to bring back a chicken. Olsen chose a five-and-a-half-month-old Wyandotte chicken named Mike. The axe removed the bulk of the head, but missed the jugular vein, leaving one ear and most of the brain stem intact. Due to Olsen's failed attempt to behead Mike, the chicken was still able to balance on a perch and walk clumsily. He attempted to preen, peck for food, and crow, though with limited success; his \\"crowing\\" consisted of a gurgling sound made in his throat. When Mike did not die, Olsen instead decided to care for the bird. He fed it a mixture of milk and water via an eyedropper, and gave it small grains of corn and worms. Fame Once his fame had been established, Mike began a career of touring sideshows in the company of such other anomalies as a two-headed baby. He was also photographed for dozens of magazines and papers, and was featured in Time and Life magazines. Mike was put on display to the public for an admission cost of 25 cents. At the height of his popularity, the chicken's owner earned US$4,500 per month (); Mike was valued at $10,000 (). Death In March 1947, at a motel in Phoenix on a stopover while traveling back from tour, Mike started choking in the middle of the night. He had managed to get a kernel of corn in his throat. The Olsens had inadvertently left their feeding and cleaning syringes at the sideshow the day before, and so were unable to save Mike. Olsen claimed that he had sold the bird off, resulting in stories of Mike still touring the country as late as 1949. Other sources say that the chicken's severed trachea could not properly take in enough air to be able to breathe, and it therefore choked to death in the motel. Explanation of the case It was determined that the axe had missed the jugular vein and a clot had prevented Mike from bleeding to death. Although most of his head was severed, most of his brain stem and one ear were left on his body. Since basic functions (breathing, heart rate, etc.) as well as most of a chicken's reflex actions are controlled by the brain stem, Mike was able to remain quite healthy. This is a good example of central motor generators enabling basic homeostatic functions to be carried out in the absence of higher brain centres. In addition, birds possess a secondary balance organ in the pelvic region, the lumbosacral organ, which controls walking locomotion virtually independently from the vestibular organ involved in flight. This has been used to explain how a headless chicken can walk and balance, despite the destruction of much of the cranial vestibular system. Legacy Mike the Headless Chicken is now a cultural institution in Fruita, Colorado, with an annual \\"Mike the Headless Chicken Day\\", the third weekend of May, starting in 1999. Events held include the \\"5K Run Like a Headless Chicken Race\\", egg toss, \\"Pin the Head on the Chicken\\", the \\"Chicken Cluck-Off\\", and \\"Chicken Bingo\\", in which chicken droppings on a numbered grid choose the numbers. Mike the Headless Chicken was an inspiration for the poultry-themed comedy punk band The Radioactive Chicken Heads, serving as the subject of their 2008 song \\"Headless Mike\\", for which a music video was filmed. The band also features a Headless Mike puppet which is frequently used in their live shows.

Despite being the eldest living son of Esarhaddon at the time, Shamash-shum-ukin was designated as the heir to Babylon in 672 BC and in his stead his younger brother Ashurbanipal was designated as the heir to Assyria. Despite documents from Esarhaddon suggesting that the two brothers were intended to have equal power, Shamash-shum-ukin only ascended to the Babylonian throne months after Ashubanipal had become king and throughout his reign could only make decisions and issue orders if these were also approved and verified by Ashurbanipal. Shamash-shum-ukin assimilated well into Babylonia, despite being ethnically and culturally Assyrian. His royal inscriptions are far more \\"quintessentially Babylonian\\" than those of other Assyrian rulers of southern Mesopotamia, using Babylonian imagery and rhetoric to an unprecedented extent. He participated in the Babylonian New Year's festival and is recorded as partaking in other Babylonian traditions. The Statue of Marduk, the main cult image of Babylon's patron deity Marduk, was returned to Babylon in 668 BC at Shamash-shum-ukin's coronation, having been stolen from the city by his grandfather Sennacherib twenty years prior. Eventually, Shamash-shum-ukin grew tired of Ashurbanipal's overbearing control and in 652 BC he rebelled against his younger brother. Despite successfully raising several allies, a coalition of enemies of Assyria, to his cause, Shamash-shum-ukin's rebellion proved disastrous. After enduring a two-year siege by Ashurbanipal of Babylon, the city fell and Shamash-shum-ukin died, though the exact circumstances of his death are unclear.  Background  Shamash-shum-ukin was probably the second eldest son of King Esarhaddon, younger only than the crown prince, Sin-nadin-apli.''''' Sin-nadin-apli died unexpectedly in 674 BC and Esarhaddon, who was keen to avoid a succession crisis as he himself had only ascended to the throne with great difficulty, soon started making new succession plans. Esarhaddon entirely bypassed the third eldest son, Shamash-metu-uballit, possibly because this prince suffered from poor health.''''' In May 672 BC, Ashurbanipal, probably Esarhaddon's fourth eldest son (and definitely younger than Shamash- shum-ukin), was appointed by Esarhaddon as the heir to Assyria and Shamash- shum-ukin was appointed as the heir to Babylonia.' The two princes arrived at the capital of Nineveh together and partook in a celebration with foreign representatives and Assyrian nobles and soldiers. Promoting one of his sons as the heir to Assyria and another as the heir to Babylon was a new idea, for the past decades the Assyrian king had simultaneously been the King of Babylon.' Esarhaddon might have decided to split his titles between his sons since Esarhaddon's brothers had murdered his father Sennacherib and attempted to usurp the throne after Esarhaddon had been proclaimed as heir decades prior. By splitting rulership of the empire, he might have surmised that such jealousy and rivalry could be avoided. The choice to name a younger son as crown prince of Assyria, which was clearly Esarhaddon's primary title, and an older son as crown prince of Babylon might be explained by the mothers of the two sons. While Ashurbanipal's mother was likely Assyrian in origin, Shamash- shum-ukin was the son of a woman from Babylon (though this is uncertain, Ashurbanipal and Shamash-shum-ukin may have shared the same mother)''''' which might have had problematic consequences if Shamash-shum-ukin was to ascend to the Assyrian throne. Since Ashubanipal was the next oldest son, he then was the superior candidate to the throne. Esarhaddon might then have surmised that the Babylonians would be content with someone of Babylonian heritage as their king and as such set Shamash-shum-ukin to inherit Babylon and the southern parts of his empire instead. Treaties drawn up by Esarhaddon are somewhat unclear as to the relationship he intended his two sons to have. It is clear that Ashurbanipal was the primary heir to the empire and that Shamash-shum- ukin was to swear him an oath of allegiance but other parts also specify that Ashurbanipal was not to interfere in Shamash-shum-ukin's affairs which indicates a more equal standing. Because Esarhaddon was constantly ill, much of the administrative duties of the empire fell upon Ashurbanipal and Shamash- shum-ukin during the last few years of their father's reign.''''''  Reign = Early reign = Confirmation by Shamash-shum-ukin of a grant originally made by Ashur-nadin-shumi. 670‚Äì650 BC. After Esarhaddon's death in late 669 BC, Ashurbanipal became the Assyrian king as per Esarhaddon's succession plans. In the spring of the next year, Shamash-shum-ukin was inaugurated as the king of Babylon and returned the Statue of Marduk, Babylon's chief deity, to the city, stolen by his grandfather King Sennacherib twenty years prior. The return of the statue was particularly important as it in the eyes of the Babylonians cemented Marduk's approval of the new king's rule. Though Samash- shum-ukin, an Assyrian prince, being installed as the King of Babylon was in a way an embodiment of Assyrian hegemony, Shamash-shum-ukin's coronation ceremony (parallelling that of Ashurbanipal) and the return of the Statue of Marduk were efforts made to portray him as an independent king of Babylon. Samash-shum-ukin was the only member of the Assyrian royal family (the Sargonid dynasty) to accede to the Babylonian throne and intentionally never to the Assyrian one. The only other Sargonid prince who ruled Babylon and not Assyria was Shamash-shum-ukin's uncle Ashur-nadin-shumi, though he had been the crown prince of Sennacherib and the intended successor in Assyria as well. Though Ashurbanipal, as King of Assyria, was more powerful, Shamash-shum- ukin's kingship of Babylon, important to the Assyrians for military, political, religious and ideological reasons, was prestigious in its own right. Shamash-shum-ukin would rule at Babylon for sixteen years, apparently mostly peacefully in regards to his younger brother, but there would be repeated disagreements on the exact extent of his control. Although Esarhaddon's inscriptions suggest that Shamash-shum-ukin should have been granted the entirety of Babylonia to rule, contemporary records only definitely prove that Shamash-shum-ukin held Babylon itself and its vicinity. The governors of some Babylonian cities, such as Nippur, Uruk and Ur, and the rulers in the Sea Land, all ignored the existence of a king in Babylon and saw Ashurbanipal as their monarch. Shamash-shum-ukin is recorded as having participated in several traditional Babylonian royal activities. He rebuilt the walls of the city Sippar and is known to have participated in the Babylonian New Year's festival, which had been suspended during the time that the god's statue was absent from the city. He gave considerable attention to the temples of his domain, confirming offerings in several temples in his inscriptions and increasing the land of the Ishtar temple in Uruk. Shamash- shum-ukin was ethnically and culturally Assyrian, but appears to have assimilated well into Babylonia. His royal inscriptions are far more \\"quintessentially Babylonian\\" than those of other Assyrian rulers of southern Mesopotamia, using Babylonian imagery and rhetoric to an unprecedented extent, almost as if overriding his actual cultural and ethnic origin as an Assyrian. Though he was in Assyria at some points, such as when he returned the Marduk statue and on one occasion when he was feeling sick, Shamash-shum-ukin was presumably the first of the rulers of the Sargonid dynasty to live in the city full-time. Throughout his Babylonian reign, Shamash-shum-ukin partook in several building projects, an important aspect of Babylonian kingship to the same degree as military campaigns were important in Assyrian kingship. He is recorded as restoring shrines in several cities and as rebuilding the city wall of Sippar. Despite his kingship having been designated by Esarhaddon, Ashurbanipal refers to himself in his inscriptions as the man who granted Shamash-shum-ukin rule over Babylon. This is possibly due to Shamash-shum-ukin only being formally crowned as king a few months after Ashurbanipal had become the Assyrian monarch and that it would have been within Ashurbanipal's power to stop his coronation. = Status = Locations of some major alt= The exact reasons for Samash-shum-ukin's revolt against Ashurbanipal are unknown, but there are several possibilities. Perhaps the most commonly believed reason is that although Esarhaddon had designated Shamash-shum-ukin to inherit control of all of Babylonia, this had not been respected by Ashurbanipal once Esarhaddon was dead. Although business documents from Shamash-shum-ukin are known throughout Babylonia (suggesting that most of the region saw him as their king), similar documents dated to the reign of Ashurbanipal are also known from Babylonia, which suggests that Ashurbanipal had assumed the authority of a Babylonian monarch despite there already being a king in Babylon. The cities Babylon, Dilbat, Borsippa and Sippar all lack business documents from Ashurbanipal, suggesting that these cities were firmly under Shamash-shum-ukin's rule, but Ashurbanipal had agents throughout the south that reported directly to him (not to Shamash-shum-ukin) and inscriptions suggest that any orders Shamash-shum-ukin gave to his subjects first had to be verified and approved by Ashurbanipal before they could be carried out. Ashurbanipal had a permanent garrison of troops and officials stationed at Borsippa, a city which would have been deep inside Shamash-shum-ukin's domain. There are also preserved petitions sent by officials in Babylon directly to Ashurbanipal. Had Shamash-shum-ukin been the universally respected sovereign of Babylon, he would probably have been the receiver of such letters. Royal records from Babylonia during the time of peaceful coexistence between Ashurbanipal and Shamash-shum-ukin mention the names of both monarchs, but contemporary documents from Assyria only mention Ashurbanipal, reinforcing that the two kings were not equal in status. Kudurru, who was the governor of Uruk, addressed Ashurbanipal in his letters with the title \\"King of the Lands\\", despite Uruk being located in Babylonia, indicating that Kudurru saw Ashurbanipal, and not Shamash-shum-ukin, as his overlord. Shamash-shum-ukin himself seems to have seen himself as Ashurbanipal's equal, simply addressing him as \\"my brother\\" in his letters (unlike how he addressed his father Esarhaddon, \\"the king, my father\\"). Although there are several letters preserved from Shamash-shum-ukin to Ashurbanipal, there are no known replies preserved. It is possible that Ashurbanipal, on account of his network of informers, did not feel a need to write to his brother. = Revolt against Ashurbanipal and death = Babylonian prisoners under Assyrian guard, reign of Ashurbanipal 668-630 BC, Nineveh. By the 650s BC, the hostility between Shamash-shum-ukin and Ashurbanipal had grown. A letter from Zakir, a courtier at Shamash-shum-ukin's court, to Ashurbanipal described how visitors from the Sea Land had publicly criticized Ashurbanipal in front of Shamash-shum-ukin, using the phrase \\"this is not the word of a king!\\". Zakir reported that though Shamash-shum-ukin was angered, he and his governor of Babylon, Ubaru, chose to not take action against the visitors. Perhaps the most important factors behind Shamash-shum-ukin's revolt was his dissatisfaction with his position relative to that of his brother, the constant resentment of Assyria in general by the Babylonians and the constant willingness of the ruler of Elam to join anyone who waged war against Assyria. Shamash-shum-ukin rebelled against Ashurbanipal in 652 BC.' This civil war would last for three years. The rebellion was not an attempt to claim the Assyrian throne, but rather an attempt at securing the independence of Babylonia. Inscription evidence suggests that Shamash-shum-ukin addressed the citizens of Babylon to join him in his revolt. In Ashurbanipal's inscriptions, Shamash-shum-ukin is quoted to have said \\"Ashurbanipal will cover with shame the name of the Babylonians\\", which Ashurbanipal refers to as \\"wind\\" and \\"lies\\". Soon after Shamash-shum- ukin began his revolt, the rest of southern Mesopotamia rose up against Ashurbanipal alongside him. Early in the war, Ashurbanipal tried to get various local governors in the south to join his side instead, writing to them in hopes that some of them might be interested in de-escalating the war. In these letters, Ashurbanipal never refers to Shamash-shum-ukin by name, instead calling him lƒÅ a·∏´u (\\"no-brother\\"). In many inscriptions, Shamash-shum-ukin is simply identified as the \\"unfaithful brother\\", \\"enemy brother\\" or just \\"the enemy\\". In some of the letters Ashurbanipal referred to him as \\"this man whom Marduk hates\\" in an effort to undermine his legitimacy as a Babylonian king. According to the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal, Shamash-shum-ukin was very successful in finding allies against the Assyrians. Ashurbanipal identifies three groups which aided his brother, first and foremost there were the Chaldeans, Arameans and the other peoples of Babylonia, then there were the Elamites and lastly the kings of Gutium, Amurru and Meluhha. This last group of kings might refer to the Medes (as Gutium, Amurru and Meluhha no longer existed at this point) but this is uncertain. Meluhha might have referred to Egypt, which did not aid Shamash-shum-ukin in the war. Shamash-shum-ukin's ambassadors to the Elamites had offered gifts (called \\"bribes\\" by Ashurbanipal) and their king sent an army under the command of an Elamite prince to aid in the conflict. Despite the coalition of Assyrian enemies he had assembled, Shamash-shum-ukin's revolt would be unsuccessful. The Elamites, his primary ally, were defeated near Der and ceased to play a role in the conflict. By 650 BC Shamash-shum-ukin's situation looked grim, with Ashubanipal's forces having besieged Sippar, Borsippa, Kutha and Babylon itself. Having endured starvation and disease over the course of the siege, Babylon finally fell in 648 BC and was plundered by Ashurbanipal.' One of Shamash-shum-ukin's recorded prayers records his despair in the final stages of the war: Shamash-shum-ukin is traditionally believed to have committed suicide by setting himself on fire in his palace,' but contemporary texts only say that he \\"met a cruel death\\" and that the gods \\"consigned him to a fire and destroyed his life\\". In addition to suicide though self-immolation or other means, it is possible that he was executed, died accidentally or was killed in some other way. Most of the accounts of his death state that it involved fire in some capacity, but do not give more elaborate details. The gods are typically identified as playing a part (perhaps burning him away with fire themselves) due to Shamash-shum-ukin's war against Ashurbanipal also being framed by Ashurbanipal as impious. If Shamash-shum-ukin was executed, it would be logical for the Assyrian scribes to leave this out of historical records since fratricide (killing a brother) was illegal and even if a soldier (and not Ashurbanipal) had carried it out, it would still constitute a murder of a member of the Assyrian royal family. Had a soldier killed Shamash-shum-ukin, he might very well have been executed himself. After Shamash-shum-ukin's death, Ashubanipal placed one of his officials, Kandalanu, on the Babylonian throne as his vassal.'  Legacy  Ashurbanipal inspects booty and prisoners from Babylon after a two years long siege, 648 BC. Shamash-shum-ukin's rebellion and downfall represented a difficult case for the Assyrian royal scribes who recorded history. As Shamash-shum-ukin was both a member of the Assyrian royal family and a traitorous Babylonian king, it was difficult to write of his fate; while scribes eagerly recorded lengthy accounts of the defeat of foreign kings and rebels, there was a general reluctance to write about the death of members of the Assyrian royal family. Matters might have been complicated further by the fact that unlike many other rebels faced by the Assyrians, Shamash-shum-ukin was not a usurper, but the legitimately installed ruler of Babylon, by decree of an Assyrian king. Ashurbanipal's personal inscriptions offer little in regards to the end of Shamash-shum- ukin's life and Assyrian kings after Ashurbanipal do not mention him at all, almost as if he had never existed in the first place. Ashurbanipal's inscriptions talk around his brother's death and in many places even omit Shamash-shum-ukin's name, simply calling him \\"the king\\". In a relief from Ashurbanipal's palace at Nineveh, depicting his victory over the Babylonian revolt, soldiers are depicted as giving the Babylonian crown and the Babylonian royal insignia to him, but Shamash-shum-ukin is conspicuously absent. There is evidence of a considerable damnatio memoriae following Shamash-shum-ukin's downfall, with steles erected by the king being purposefully mutilated after his death, erasing his face.  Titulature  Shamash-shum-ukin's most frequently used title was ≈°ar BƒÅbili (\\"King of Babylon\\"), though there exists a single inscription where he used ≈°akkanakki BƒÅbili (\\"Viceroy of Babylon\\") instead. In the inscriptions of other Assyrian kings who ruled the city, \\"viceroy\\" is typically more common than \\"king\\". He also assumed other traditional Babylonian royal titles, such as ≈°ar mƒÅt ≈†umeri u Akkadi (\\"King of Sumer and Akkad\\"). Overall, his titulary was quintessentially Babylonian to a much higher degree than other Assyrian rulers of the city. As typically done by Assyrian rulers, Shamash-shum-ukin venerates his ancestors in many of his inscriptions, typically naming his great- grandfather Sargon II, his grandfather Sennacherib (from whom he typically omits the title \\"King of Babylon\\" due to Sennacherib's actions against the city), his father Esarhaddon and sometimes his brother Ashurbanipal. Their inclusion in his titles may be because of fears that his legitimacy might be questioned if they were omitted. The specific way his ancestors were presented, and Shamash-shum-ukin's use of deities in his inscriptions, set him apart from other Assyrian rulers. Significantly, Shamash-shum-ukin left out any mentions of the role of his royal ancestors as chief priests of Assyria's god Ashur, a concept intrinsically linked to Assyrian ideas of kingship. As expected for a ruler of Babylon, the deity most frequently referenced in Shamash-shum-ukin's royal inscriptions is Marduk, but Shamash-shum-ukin's inscriptions do not contain a single mention of Ashur, who was otherwise included (though sometimes in a reduced capacity) in the inscriptions of those of his ancestors who ruled both Assyria and Babylonia. Despite Shamash-shum- ukin publicly identifying himself as an Assyrian (through his genealogy), his inscriptions thus suggest that he did not venerate Assyria's national deity. In many places in his titles, Shamash-shum-ukin appropriated Assyrian titular conventions in regards to how deities were used but substituted the important gods in Assyria, such as Ashur, Ishtar and S√Æn, for deities more venerated in the south, such as Marduk and Sarpanit.

Plot The film tells the story of a Sephardi family of Egyptian Jewish immigrants from Alexandria that settle in 1947 Tel Aviv. The family consists of a 33-year-old widowed wife, Clara, (played by Gila Almagor, one of the most prominent actresses in Israel for the last three decades) and her four children. They live in a working-class neighborhood surrounded by their extended family, including Clara's mother Mazal, Clara's uncle Rafael, and Sultana, his wife. The plot centers on the firstborn, Sami, his transition from a shy 15-year-old to a working man and an activist in the \\"Irgun\\" (a resistance movement that acted mainly against the military forces of the British), and the romantic attachment he develops with a 25-year-old Russian immigrant librarian (Michal Bat-Adam, now a director). In addition to this, Clara struggles between social pressure to take a husband and her own complex feelings surrounding this, complicated by another Sephardi Egyptian, played by Yosef Shiloach, who has strong feelings for her.

Georgia, and the last person put to death in the state of Iowa. While at the time the news media paid little attention to Victor Feguer or his execution, Timothy McVeigh's execution sparked renewed media interest in Feguer. Background Feguer was a drifter, native to the state of Michigan. In the summer of 1960, Feguer arrived in Dubuque, Iowa, renting a room at a decrepit boarding house. Soon after arriving, Feguer began phoning physicians alphabetically from the local Yellow Pages and found Dr. Edward Bartels. Feguer claimed that a woman needed medical attention. When Dr. Bartels arrived, Feguer kidnapped and killed him in Illinois. Bartels' body was found in a cornfield there with a single gunshot to the head. A few days later, Feguer was arrested in Birmingham, Alabama, after trying to sell Dr. Bartels' car to James B. Alford, who tipped off the FBI. Alford later told a local newspaper he suspected Feguer was a crook because he had an out-of-state car but no title papers. Authorities believe that Feguer had kidnapped and killed Dr. Bartels in order to gain access to any drugs that Bartels may have carried to treat patients. Because Feguer transported his hostage across state lines, federal charges were filed against Feguer. In his defense, Feguer claimed that a drug addict from Chicago, whom Feguer met in Dubuque, had actually murdered Bartels. Feguer claimed that he killed the drug addict and dumped his body in the Mississippi River. However, authorities could not find any evidence that this other person ever existed. Feguer was tried and convicted in federal court for these crimes. He was sentenced to death by hanging. Feguer submitted an appeal, which was denied. At that point, only President John F. Kennedy could have commuted the death sentence. Iowa's governor, Harold Hughes, a death penalty opponent, along with Feguer's attorney, contacted Kennedy to request clemency for Feguer. Kennedy thought that the crime was so brutal that he denied their request. Last days=At Fort Madison= Victor Feguer was held at the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas. He was taken back to Iowa because Leavenworth was not set up at the time to perform executions. On March 5, 1963, Feguer was taken to the Iowa State Penitentiary at Fort Madison, Iowa and placed in the state's death row to await execution. He remained there for the next ten days until his execution was carried out. He spent those ten days quietly; guards said he was a model prisoner. =March 15, 1963= For his last meal, Feguer did not want anything fancy; in fact, his request was not even really a meal at all. All he wanted was a single olive with the pit still in it. He told guards he hoped an olive tree would sprout from his grave as a sign of peace. On March 14, 1963, Feguer sat in an all-night vigil with a Roman Catholic priest. Between 4 and 5 in the morning of March 15, Feguer was given a new suit for his execution. Two guards escorted him to the gallows, and he was hanged at dawn. The witnesses included an Associated Press journalist and John Ely, then a member of the Iowa House of Representatives, whose witnessing of the execution reinforced his opposition to the death penalty, leading him to work to abolish the state death penalty in Iowa, which occurred in 1965, but which had no effect on the federal law under which Feguer had been executed. After Feguer was pronounced dead, authorities found the pit from the olive in one of his suit pockets. The body was removed by a local funeral home. Feguer's death certificate listed \\"fracture cervical spinal column\\" as the cause of death. Feguer was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Madison City Cemetery in Iowa wearing a second new suit that was provided for his burial. Aftermath Victor Feguer would be the last person to be executed in Iowa. After Feguer's death, it would be nearly 40 years until the next federal execution ‚Äì that of Timothy McVeigh, carried out on June 11, 2001, in Terre Haute, Indiana. Iowa abolished capital punishment for all crimes in 1965. Over the years, several attempts have been made to reinstate the death penalty in Iowa. This became a major issue in the 1994 election, as a young girl had recently been murdered, as well as in 2005 after the murder of another young girl. However, the legislature declined to reinstate the death penalty. Previous Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack made it clear that he would veto legislation that would restore the death penalty, even if it would only be on a limited basis. , Iowa is one of 22 U.S. states to have completely abolished capital punishment.

Markowitz is a professor of finance at the Rady School of Management at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). He is best known for his pioneering work in modern portfolio theory, studying the effects of asset risk, return, correlation and diversification on probable investment portfolio returns. Biography Harry Markowitz was born to a Jewish family, the son of Morris and Mildred Markowitz.Harry M. Markowitz ‚Äì Autobiography, The Nobel Prizes 1990, Editor Tore Fr√§ngsmyr, [Nobel Foundation], Stockholm, 1991 During high school, Markowitz developed an interest in physics and philosophy, in particular the ideas of David Hume, an interest he continued to follow during his undergraduate years at the University of Chicago. After receiving his Ph.B. in Liberal Arts, Markowitz decided to continue his studies at the University of Chicago, choosing to specialize in economics. There he had the opportunity to study under important economists, including Milton Friedman, Tjalling Koopmans, Jacob Marschak and Leonard Savage. While still a student, he was invited to become a member of the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics, which was in Chicago at the time. He completed his A.M. in Economics from the university in 1950. Markowitz chose to apply mathematics to the analysis of the stock market as the topic for his dissertation. Jacob Marschak, who was the thesis advisor, encouraged him to pursue the topic, noting that it had also been a favorite interest of Alfred Cowles, the founder of the Cowles Commission. While researching the then current understanding of stock prices, which at the time consisted in the present value model of John Burr Williams, Markowitz realized that the theory lacks an analysis of the impact of risk. This insight led to the development of his seminal theory of portfolio allocation under uncertainty, published in 1952 by the Journal of Finance. In 1952, Harry Markowitz went to work for the RAND Corporation, where he met George Dantzig. With Dantzig's help, Markowitz continued to research optimization techniques, further developing the critical line algorithm for the identification of the optimal mean-variance portfolios, relying on what was later named the Markowitz frontier. In 1954, he received a PhD in Economics from the University of Chicago with a thesis on the portfolio theory. The topic was so novel that, while Markowitz was defending his dissertation, Milton Friedman argued his contribution was not economics.Harry M. Markowitz ‚Äì Nobel Prize Lecture: Foundations of Portfolio Theory, December 7, 1990 ( PDF format) During 1955‚Äì1956 Markowitz spent a year at the Cowles Foundation, which had moved to Yale University, at the invitation of James Tobin. He published the critical line algorithm in a 1956 paper and used this time at the foundation to write a book on portfolio allocation which was published in 1959. (reprinted by Yale University Press, 1970, ; 2nd ed. Basil Blackwell, 1991, ) Markowitz won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990 while a professor of finance at Baruch College of the City University of New York. In the preceding year, he received the John von Neumann Theory Prize from the Operations Research Society of America (now Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences, INFORMS) for his contributions in the theory of three fields: portfolio theory; sparse matrix methods; and simulation language programming (SIMSCRIPT). Sparse matrix methods are now widely used to solve very large systems of simultaneous equations whose coefficients are mostly zero. SIMSCRIPT has been widely used to program computer simulations of manufacturing, transportation, and computer systems as well as war games. SIMSCRIPT (I) included the Buddy memory allocation method, which was also developed by Markowitz. He was elected to the 2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences. =CACI= The company that would become CACI International was founded by Herb Karr and Harry Markowitz on July 17, 1962 as California Analysis Center, Inc. They helped develop SIMSCRIPT, the first simulation programming language, at RAND and after it was released to the public domain, CACI was founded to provide support and training for SIMSCRIPT. In 1968, Markowitz joined Arbitrage Management company founded by Michael Goodkin. Working with Paul Samuelson and Robert Merton he created a hedge fund that represents the first known attempt at computerized arbitrage trading. He took over as chief executive in 1970. After a successful run as a private hedge fund, AMC was sold to Stuart & Co. in 1971. A year later, Markowitz left the company.Goodkin, Michael.

John Wiley & Sons, 2012 Years later, he was involved with CACI's SIMSCRIPT addition of Object-oriented features. =Post CACI= Markowitz divides his time between teaching (he is an adjunct professor at the Rady School of Management at the University of California at San Diego, UCSD); video casting lectures; and consulting (out of his Harry Markowitz Company offices). He currently serves on the Advisory Board of SkyView Investment Advisors, a traditional and alternative investment advisory firm. Markowitz also serves on the Investment Committee of LWI Financial Inc. (\\"Loring Ward\\"), a San Jose, California-based investment advisor; on the advisory panel of Robert D. Arnott's Newport Beach, California based investment management firm, Research Affiliates; on the Advisory Board of Mark Hebner's Irvine, California and internet based investment advisory firm, Index Fund Advisors; and as an advisor to the Investment Committee of 1st Global, a Dallas, Texas-based wealth management and investment advisory firm. Markowitz advises and serves on the board of ProbabilityManagement.org, a 501(c)(3) non-profit founded by Dr. Sam L. Savage to reshape the communication and calculation of uncertainty. Markowitz is co-founder and Chief Architect of GuidedChoice, a 401(k) managed accounts provider and investment advisor.GuidedChoice, \\"Harry Markowitz‚Äôs Modern Portfolio Theory: The Efficient Frontier\\" Markowitz's more recent work has included designing the backbone software analytics for the GuidedChoice investment solution and heading the GuidedChoice Investment Committee. He is actively involved in designing the next step in the retirement process: assisting retirees with wealth distribution through GuidedSpending. Research A Markowitz-efficient portfolio is one where diversification can lower the portfolio's risk for a given return expectation (alternately, no additional expected return can be gained without increasing the risk of the portfolio). The Markowitz Efficient Frontier is the set of all portfolios that will give the highest expected return for each given level of risk. These concepts of efficiency were essential to the development of the capital asset pricing model. Markowitz also co-edited the textbook The Theory and Practice of Investment Management with Frank J. Fabozzi of Yale School of Management. In the same line, Markowitz is part of the Editorial Board of AESTIMATIO, the IEB International Journal of Finance.

It is debated among scholarsRashi on 28:17 whether Luz and Bethel represent the same town - the former the Canaanite name, and the latter the Hebrew name - or whether they were distinct places in close proximity to each other. According to the King James Version (KJV), Luz was renamed by Jacob: \\"And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.‚Äù (Genesis 28:19) Mentioned in Book of Judges A second city called Luz, founded by a man who came from the original Luz, is mentioned in Judges 1:22: \\"And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el; and the LORD was with them. 23 And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Beth-elnow the name of the city beforetime was Luz. 24 And the watchers saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him: 'Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with thee.' 25 And he showed them the entrance into the city, and they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man go and all his family. 26 And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz, which is the name thereof unto this day.\\" This second Luz is identified by some with Louaize, or Wazzani, four miles northwest of Banias, in the Golan Heights.

The novel chronicles the travels and adventures of Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov (Russian: –ü–∞–≤–µ–ª –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á –ß–∏—á–∏–∫–æ–≤) and the people whom he encounters. These people typify the Russian middle-class of the time. Gogol himself saw his work as an \\"epic poem in prose\\", and within the book characterised it as a \\"novel in verse\\". Despite supposedly completing the trilogy's second part, Gogol destroyed it shortly before his death. Although the novel ends in mid-sentence (like Sterne's Sentimental Journey), it is usually regarded as complete in the extant form. Christopher English writes that \\"Susanne Fusso compellingly argues in her book Designing Dead Souls that Dead Souls is complete in Part One, that there was never meant to be a Part Two or Part Three, and that it is entirely consistent with Gogol's method to create the expectation of sequels, and even to break off his narrative in mid-story, or mid-sentence, and that he was only persuaded to embark on composition of the second part by the expectation of the Russian reading public\\". - Title The original title, as shown on the illustration (cover page), was \\"The Wanderings of Chichikov, or Dead Souls. Poema\\", which contracted to merely \\"Dead Souls\\". In the Russian Empire, before the emancipation of the serfs in 1861, landowners had the right to own serfs to farm their land. Serfs were for most purposes considered the property of the landowner, who could buy, sell or mortgage them, as any other chattel. To count serfs (and people in general), the measure word \\"soul\\" was used: e.g., \\"six souls of serfs\\". The plot of the novel relies on \\"dead souls\\" (i.e., \\"dead serfs\\") which are still accounted for in property registers. On another level, the title refers to the \\"dead souls\\" of Gogol's characters, all of which represent different aspects of poshlost (a Russian noun rendered as \\"commonplace, vulgarity\\", moral and spiritual, with overtones of middle-class pretentiousness, fake significance and philistinism). It is also described as a picaresque novel, the literary genre virtually non-existent in Russian literature of the times.\\"–û—Å—Ç–∞–ø –ë–µ–Ω–¥–µ—Ä\\", Radio Liberty, transcript of a talk from cycle \\"Heroes of the Time\\", host:–ü–µ—Ç—Ä –í–∞–π–ª—å, guests: culturologist –ú–∞—Ä–∏—ç—Ç—Ç–∞ –ß—É–¥–∞–∫–æ–≤–∞ and actors Archil Gomiashvili (Bender-1971) and Sergey Yursky (Bender-1993) Background The first part of the novel was intended to represent a modern-day Inferno of the Divine Comedy. Gogol reveals to his readers an encompassing picture of the ailing social system in Russia after the unsuccessful French invasion. As in many of Gogol's short stories, the social criticism of Dead Souls is communicated primarily through absurd and hilarious satire. Unlike the short stories, however, Dead Souls was meant to offer solutions rather than simply point out problems. This grander scheme was largely unrealized at Gogol's death; the work was never completed, and it is primarily the earlier, darker part of the novel that is remembered. In their studies of Gogol, Andrey Bely, D. S. Mirsky, Vladimir Nabokov, and other modernist critics rejected the commonly held view of Dead Souls as a reformist or satirical work. For instance, Nabokov regarded the plot of Dead Souls as unimportant and Gogol as a great writer whose works skirted the irrational and whose prose style combined superb descriptive power with a disregard for novelistic clich√©s. True, Chichikov displays a most extraordinary moral rot, but the whole idea of buying and selling dead souls is, to Nabokov, ridiculous on its face; therefore, the provincial setting of the novel is a most unsuitable backdrop for any of the progressive, reformist or Christian readings of the work. Structure Chichikov in the house of M-me Korobochka. The novel has a circular structure, following Chichikov as he visits the estates of landowners living around the capital of a guberniya. Although Gogol aspired to emulate the Odyssey and the Divine Comedy, many critics derive the structure of Dead Souls from the picaresque novels of the 16th and 17th centuries in that it is divided into a series of somewhat disjointed episodes, and the plot concerns a gentrified version of the rascal protagonist of the original picaresques. Konstantin Aksakov was the first to bring out a detailed juxtaposition of Gogol's and Homer's works: \\"Gogol's epic revives the ancient Homeric epic; you recognize its character of importance, its artistic merits and the widest scope. When comparing one thing to another, Gogol completely loses himself in the subject, leaving for a time the occasion that gave rise to his comparison; he will talk about it, until the subject is exhausted. Every reader of The Iliad was struck by this device, too.\\" Nabokov also pointed out the Homeric roots of the complicated absurdist technique of Gogol's comparisons and digressions. Characters Of all Gogol's creations, Chichikov stands out as the incarnation of poshlost. His psychological leitmotiv is complacency, and his geometrical expression roundness. The other characters‚Äîthe squires Chichikov visits on his shady business‚Äîare typical \\"humors\\" (for Gogol's method of comic character drawing, with its exaggerations and geometrical simplification, is strongly reminiscent of Ben Jonson's). Sobakevich, the strong, silent, economical man, square and bearlike; Manilov, the silly sentimentalist with pursed lips; M-me Korobochka, the stupid widow; Nozdryov, the cheat and bully, with the manners of a hearty good fellow ‚Äî are all types of eternal solidity. Plyushkin, the miser, stands apart, for in him Gogol sounds a note of tragedy‚Äîhe is the man ruined by his \\"humor\\"; he transcends poshlost, for in the depth of his degradation he is not complacent but miserable; he has a tragic greatness.Mirskij, Dmitrij Petroviƒç, A History of Russian Literature from its Beginnings to 1900, ed. by Francis J. Whitfield (Illinois, Northwestern University Press, 1999), pp. 160 The lamentful description of Plyushkin's garden was hailed by Nabokov as the pinnacle of Gogol's art. Plot The story follows the exploits of Chichikov, a middle-aged gentleman of middling social class and means. Chichikov arrives in a small town and turns on the charm to woo key local officials and landowners. He reveals little about his past, or his purpose, as he sets about carrying out his bizarre and mysterious plan to acquire \\"dead souls.\\" Chichikov and Nozdryov. The government would tax the landowners based on how many serfs (or \\"souls\\") the landowner owned, determined by the census. Censuses in this period were infrequent, so landowners would often be paying taxes on serfs that were no longer living, thus the \\"dead souls.\\" It is these dead souls, existing on paper only, that Chichikov seeks to purchase from the landlords in the villages he visits; he merely tells the prospective sellers that he has a use for them, and that the sellers would be better off anyway, since selling them would relieve the present owners of a needless tax burden. Although the townspeople Chichikov comes across are gross caricatures, they are not flat stereotypes by any means. Instead, each is neurotically individual, combining the official failings that Gogol typically satirizes (greed, corruption, paranoia) with a curious set of personal quirks. Illustration by Alexander Agin: The Simply Pleasant Lady and The Lady Who Is Pleasant In All Respects Setting off for the surrounding estates, Chichikov at first assumes that the ignorant provincials will be more than eager to give their dead souls up in exchange for a token payment. The task of collecting the rights to dead people proves difficult, however, due to the persistent greed, suspicion, and general distrust of the landowners. He still manages to acquire some 400 souls, swears the sellers to secrecy, and returns to the town to have the transactions recorded legally. Back in the town, Chichikov continues to be treated like a prince amongst the petty officials, and a celebration is thrown in honour of his purchases. Very suddenly, however, rumours flare up that the serfs he bought are all dead, and that he was planning to elope with the Governor's daughter. In the confusion that ensues, the backwardness of the irrational, gossip-hungry townspeople is most delicately conveyed. Absurd suggestions come to light, such as the possibility that Chichikov is Napoleon in disguise or the notorious vigilante 'Captain Kopeikin'. The now disgraced traveller is immediately ostracized from the company he had been enjoying and has no choice but to flee the town. Chichikov is revealed by the author to be a former mid-level government official fired for corruption and narrowly avoiding jail. His macabre mission to acquire \\"dead souls\\" is actually just another one of his \\"get rich quick\\" schemes. Once he acquires enough dead souls, he will take out an enormous loan against them and pocket the money. In the novel's second section, Chichikov flees to another part of Russia and attempts to continue his venture. He tries to help the idle landowner Tentetnikov gain favor with General Betrishchev so that Tentetnikov may marry the general's daughter, Ulinka. To do this, Chichikov agrees to visit many of Betrishchev's relatives, beginning with Colonel Koshkaryov. From there Chichikov begins again to go from estate to estate, encountering eccentric and absurd characters all along the way. Eventually he purchases an estate from the destitute Khlobuyev but is arrested when he attempts to forge the will of Khlobuyev's rich aunt. He is pardoned thanks to the intervention of the kindly Mourazov but is forced to flee the village. The novel ends mid-sentence with the prince who arranged Chichikov's arrest giving a grand speech that rails against corruption in the Russian government. Adaptations Mikhail Bulgakov adapted the novel for the stage for a production at the Moscow Art Theatre. The seminal theatre practitioner Constantin Stanislavski directed the play, which opened on 28 November 1932.Benedetti (1999, 389). The extant sections of Dead Souls formed the basis for an opera in 1976 by Russian composer Rodion Shchedrin. In it Shchedrin captures the different townspeople with whom Chichikov deals in isolated musical episodes, each of which employs a different musical style to evoke the character's particular personality. The novel was adapted for screen in 1984 by Mikhail Schweitzer as a television miniseries Dead Souls. In 2006 the novel was dramatised for radio in two parts by the BBC and broadcast on Radio 4. It was played more for comic than satirical effect, the main comedy deriving from the performance of Mark Heap as Chichikov and from the original placing of the narrator. Michael Palin narrates the story, but is revealed actually to be following Chichikov, riding in his coach for example, or sleeping in the same bed, constantly irritating Chichikov with his running exposition. The first UK theatre production was staged by Theatre Collection in London during November 2014, directed by Victor Sobchak and starring Garry Voss as Chichikov and Vera Horton as Korobochka.

He also organised his own theatre companies and was a music publisher. Early life Edwards was born Gustav Schmelowsky in Inowrazlaw (Inowroc≈Çaw), German Empire. His family boarded the steamship Spaarndam as steerage passengers; they arrived at the Port of New York on 29 July 1891 ending up in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. During the day, he worked in the family cigar store, and in the evenings, he wandered looking for any sort of show business job. He found work as a singer at various lodge halls, on ferry boat lounges, in saloons, and even between bouts at the athletic clubs. There is a story that in the early 1890s Edwards met up with famed prizefighter John L. Sullivan, by then working in vaudeville, who was so impressed with the youngster that he decided to employ him in his act. As a very young boy, Edwards worked as a song plugger at Koster and Bial's, at Tony Pastor's theatre, and at the Bowery Theatre. In those old vaudeville days, song publishers would often hire a very young boy to sit in the theatre, and immediately after a vaudeville star had sung one of the publisher's songs, the youngster would stand up in the audience, and pretending to be completely overcome by the song, break out in an \\"extemporaneous\\" solo of the same tune. In this way, the young Edwards would often sit in a balcony seat, and then stand and repeat a song that vaudeville stars such as Maggie Cline, Lottie Gilson or Emma Carus had just sung. Career In 1896, Edwards was 17 years old and appearing at Johnny Palmer's Gaiety Saloon in Brooklyn, when James Hyde, a vaudeville agent, saw him performing. He booked a tour for Edwards and four other boys as The Newsboys Quintet act. In 1898, while performing in this act, Edwards wrote his first song, to a lyric by Tom Daly, \\"All I Want is My Black Baby Back\\". Edwards could not write music at that time, so he hired Charles Previn to write down the notes. May Irwin sang the song in her act, and helped to popularize it. While entertaining soldiers at Camp Black, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Edwards met lyricist Will Cobb, and they formed \\"Words and Music\\", a partnership that lasted for many years. He was a vaudeville singer, and later had his own vaudeville company. He discovered Walter Winchell, Elsie Janis, George Jessel, Eddie Cantor, Groucho Marx, Phil Silvers, Lila Lee, Georgie Price, Eleanor Powell, Hildegarde, Ray Bolger, Sally Rand, Jack Pearl, the Lane Sisters, and Ina Ray Hutton. He wrote the Broadway stage scores for \\"When We Were Forty-One\\", \\"Hip Hip Hooray\\", \\"The Merry-Go-Round\\", \\"School Days\\", \\"Ziegfeld Follies of 1910\\", \\"Sunbonnet Sue\\", and \\"Show Window\\". He founded the Gus Edwards Music Hall in New York, and also his own publishing company, then produced special subjects for films, and returned to vaudeville between 1930 and 1937, finally retiring in 1939. His chief musical collaborators included Edward Madden, Will Cobb, and Robert B. Smith. His other popular-song compositions include \\"Meet Me Under the Wisteria\\", \\"By the Light of the Silvery Moon\\", \\"I Can't Tell You Why I Love You but I Do\\", \\"Goodbye, Little Girl, Goodbye\\", \\"I Just Can't Make My Eyes Behave\\", \\"I'll Be With You When the Roses Bloom Again\\", \\"He's My Pal\\", \\"Way Down Yonder in the Cornfield\\", \\"In Zanzibar\\", \\"If a Girl Like You Loved a Boy Like Me\\", \\"Jimmy Valentine\\", \\"If I Were a Millionaire\\", \\"Laddie Boy\\" and \\"In My Merry Oldsmobile\\". Some other songs include \\"America Never Took Water and America Never Will\\", \\"Au Revoir\\", \\"Good Bye and Luck Be with You Laddie Boy\\", \\"He Long and Lean and Lanky\\", \\"Keep on A-Going\\", \\"Mothers of Men\\" and \\"My Rainbow Ribbon Girl\\". =Radio= In the 1930s, Edwards had a weekly program, School Days of the Air, on KFWB in Los Angeles, California. =Family= Woodlawn Cemetery Edwards was the brother of Leo Edwards, and the uncle of Joan Edwards and Jack Edwards. =Film= Bing Crosby played Edwards in a fictionalized version of his life in the 1939 film The Star Maker, directed by Roy Del Ruth. Edwards himself made few screen appearances, the most notable being The Hollywood Revue of 1929, in which he performs as part of a vaudeville act. He also wrote all the music for The Hollywood Revue of 1929, as credited in the closing credits of the production, with the exception of \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" with lyrics by Arthur Freed and music by Nacio Herb Brown.

Some of the movies he directed include The Long, Hot Summer (1958), The Black Orchid (1958), Paris Blues (1961), Hemingway's Adventures of a Young Man (1962), Hud (1963), The Outrage (1964), The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965), Hombre (1967), The Great White Hope (1970), Sounder (1972), Conrack (1974), Norma Rae (1979), Cross Creek (1983), Murphy's Romance (1985), Nuts (1987), and Stanley & Iris (1990). Early career and influences Poster for Power, a Living Newspaper play for the Federal Theatre Project (1937) Ritt was born to a Jewish family in Manhattan, the son of immigrant parents. He graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx. Ritt originally attended and played football for Elon College in North Carolina. The stark contrasts of the depression-era South, against his New York City upbringing, instilled in him a passion for expressing the struggles of inequality, which is apparent in the films he directed. =Early theatre= After leaving St. John's University, Ritt found work with a theater group, and began acting in plays. His first performance was as Crown in Porgy and Bess. After his performance drew favorable reviews, Ritt concluded that he could \\"only be happy in the theater.\\" Ritt then went to work with the Roosevelt administration's New Deal Works Progress Administration as a playwright for the Federal Theater Project, a federal government-funded theater support program. With work hard to find and the Depression in full effect, many WPA theater performers, directors, and writers became heavily influenced by the radical left and Communism, and Ritt was no exception. Years later, Ritt would state that he had never been a member of the Communist Party, although he considered himself a leftist and found common ground with some Marxist principles. =Group Theatre= Ritt moved on from the WPA to the Theater of Arts, then to the Group Theatre in New York City. There, he met Elia Kazan, who cast Ritt as an understudy to his play Golden Boy. Ritt continued his association with Kazan for well over a decade, later assisting - and sometimes filling in for - Kazan at The Actors Studio. He eventually becameone of the Studio's few non-performing life members. =World War II= During World War II, Ritt served with the U.S. Army Air Forces and appeared as an actor in the Air Forces' Broadway play and film Winged Victory. During the Broadway run of the play, Ritt directed a production of Sidney Kingsley's play Yellow Jack, using actors from Winged Victory and rehearsing between midnight and 3 am after Winged Victory performances. The play had a brief Broadway run and was performed again in Los Angeles when the Winged Victory troupe moved there to make the film version. Television and the Blacklist Counterattack newsletter After working as a playwright with the WPA, acting on stage, and directing hundreds of plays, Ritt became a successful television director and producer. He produced and directed episodes of Danger , Somerset Maugham TV Theatre (1950-51), Starlight Theatre (1951), and The Plymouth Playhouse (1953). =Blacklist= In 1952, Ritt was caught up by the Red Scare and investigations of communist influence in Hollywood and the movie industry. Although not directly named by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), Ritt was mentioned in an anticommunist newsletter called Counterattack, published by American Business Consultants, a group formed by three former FBI agents. Counterattack alleged that Ritt had helped Communist Party-affiliated locals of the New York-based Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union stage their annual show. Also cited was a show he had directed for Russian War Relief at Madison Square Garden. His associations with the Group Theater, founded on a Russian model, and the Federal Theater Project (which Congress had stopped funding in 1939 because of what some anti-New Deal congressmen claimed to be a left-wing political tone to some productions), were also known to HUAC. He was finally blacklisted by the television industry when a Syracuse grocer charged him with donating money to Communist China in 1951. He supported himself for five years by teaching at the Actors Studio. Career in Hollywood=Edge of the City= Unable to work in the television industry, Ritt returned to the theater for several years. By 1956, the Red Scare had decreased in intensity, and he turned to film directing. His first film as director was Edge of the City (1957), an important film for Ritt and an opportunity to give voice to his experiences. Based on the story of a union dock worker who faces intimidation by a corrupt boss, the film incorporates many themes that were to influence Ritt over the years: corruption, racism, intimidation of the individual by the group, defense of the individual against government oppression, and most notably, the redeeming quality of mercy and the value of shielding others from evil, even at the cost of sacrificing one's own reputation, career, or life. =Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman= Ritt went on to direct 25 more films. Producer Jerry Wald signed him to direct No Down Payment (1957) with Joanne Woodward. Wald later used Ritt on two adaptations of William Faulkner novels, both with Woodward: The Long, Hot Summer (1958) with Paul Newman, a big hit, and The Sound and the Fury (1959) with Yul Brynner, a flop. In between, he directed The Black Orchid (1958) at Paramount, and he then did 5 Branded Women (1960) in Europe. Ritt directed Paris Blues (1961) with Woodward and Newman. He made one more film with Wald, Hemingway's Adventures of a Young Man (1962). Ritt and Newman had a big hit with Hud (1963). Ritt's 1964 film The Outrage is an American retelling of the Kurosawa film Rashomon, and stars Laurence Harvey, Paul Newman, Claire Bloom, Edward G. Robinson, Howard Da Silva, and William Shatner. Like Kurosawa's film, Ritt employs flashbacks in his film. Paul Newman was fond of this role. He traveled to Mexico and spent time speaking to local residents to study the accents. Newman liked that the film's narrative included different points of view. Ritt directedThe Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965) with Richard Burton, then one more movie with Newman, Hombre (1967). He ended the '60s with The Brotherhood (1968). =1970s= In the 1970s, Ritt won acclaim for movies such as The Molly Maguires (1970), The Great White Hope (1970) (earning Oscar nominations for James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander), Sounder (1972), Pete 'n' Tillie (1972), and Conrack (1974) (from Pat Conroy's autobiographical novel). In 1976, Ritt made one of the first dramatic feature films about the blacklist, The Front, starring Woody Allen. The Front satirizes the use of \\"fronts\\", men and women who (either as a personal favor or in exchange for payment) allowed their names to be listed as writers for scripts actually authored by blacklisted writers. The film was based on the experiences of, and written by, one of Ritt's closest friends, screenwriter Walter Bernstein, who was blacklisted for eight years beginning in 1950. Ritt ended the decade with Casey's Shadow (1978) and Norma Rae (1979) (Oscar for Sally Field as Best Actress). =Final Films= Ritt made Back Roads (1981) with Sally Field, and Cross Creek (1983), the story of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, author of The Yearling. It was nominated for (but did not win) four Oscars, including Best Supporting Actress Alfre Woodard and Best Supporting Actor Rip Torn. He directed Murphy's Romance (1985), also starring Field. In 1987, Ritt again used extensive flashback and nonlinear storytelling techniques in the film Nuts, based on the stage play of the same name, written by Tom Topor. The film was considered a box-office disappointment in relation to its budget, although it did not actually lose money. Ritt's final film was Stanley & Iris (1990).  Personal life  Ritt and his wife Adele had a daughter, film producer Martina Wernerand, and a son, Michael. Ritt died of heart disease at age 76 in Santa Monica, California on December 8, 1990.

BCI differs from neuromodulation in that it allows for bidirectional information flow. BCIs are often directed at researching, mapping, assisting, augmenting, or repairing human cognitive or sensory-motor functions. Research on BCIs began in the 1970s at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) under a grant from the National Science Foundation, followed by a contract from DARPA. The papers published after this research also mark the first appearance of the expression brain‚Äìcomputer interface in scientific literature. Due to the cortical plasticity of the brain, signals from implanted prostheses can, after adaptation, be handled by the brain like natural sensor or effector channels. Following years of animal experimentation, the first neuroprosthetic devices implanted in humans appeared in the mid-1990s. Recently, studies in Human-computer interaction through the application of machine learning with statistical temporal features extracted from the frontal lobe, EEG brainwave data has shown high levels of success in classifying mental states (Relaxed, Neutral, Concentrating), mental emotional states (Negative, Neutral, Positive) and thalamocortical dysrhythmia. History The history of brain‚Äìcomputer interfaces (BCIs) starts with Hans Berger's discovery of the electrical activity of the human brain and the development of electroencephalography (EEG). In 1924 Berger was the first to record human brain activity by means of EEG. Berger was able to identify oscillatory activity, such as Berger's wave or the alpha wave (8‚Äì13 Hz), by analyzing EEG traces. Berger's first recording device was very rudimentary. He inserted silver wires under the scalps of his patients. These were later replaced by silver foils attached to the patient's head by rubber bandages. Berger connected these sensors to a Lippmann capillary electrometer, with disappointing results. However, more sophisticated measuring devices, such as the Siemens double-coil recording galvanometer, which displayed electric voltages as small as one ten thousandth of a volt, led to success. Berger analyzed the interrelation of alternations in his EEG wave diagrams with brain diseases. EEGs permitted completely new possibilities for the research of human brain activities. Although the term had not yet been coined, one of the earliest examples of a working brain-machine interface was the piece Music for Solo Performer (1965) by the American composer Alvin Lucier. The piece makes use of EEG and analog signal processing hardware (filters, amplifiers, and a mixing board) to stimulate acoustic percussion instruments. To perform the piece one must produce alpha waves and thereby \\"play\\" the various percussion instruments via loudspeakers which are placed near or directly on the instruments themselves. UCLA Professor Jacques Vidal coined the term \\"BCI\\" and produced the first peer-reviewed publications on this topic. Vidal is widely recognized as the inventor of BCIs in the BCI community, as reflected in numerous peer-reviewed articles reviewing and discussing the field (e.g.,Wolpaw, J.R. and Wolpaw, E.W. (2012). \\"Brain- Computer Interfaces: Something New Under the Sun\\". In: Brain-Computer Interfaces: Principles and Practice, Wolpaw, J.R. and Wolpaw (eds.), E.W. Oxford University Press.). His 1973 paper stated the \\"BCI challenge\\": Control of external objects using EEG signals. Especially he pointed out to Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) potential as a challenge for BCI control. The 1977 experiment Vidal described was the first application of BCI after his 1973 BCI challenge. It was a noninvasive EEG (actually Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP)) control of a cursor-like graphical object on a computer screen. The demonstration was movement in a maze. After his early contributions, Vidal was not active in BCI research, nor BCI events such as conferences, for many years. In 2011, however, he gave a lecture in Graz, Austria, supported by the Future BNCI project, presenting the first BCI, which earned a standing ovation. Vidal was joined by his wife, Laryce Vidal, who previously worked with him at UCLA on his first BCI project. In 1988, a report was given on noninvasive EEG control of a physical object, a robot. The experiment described was EEG control of multiple start-stop-restart of the robot movement, along an arbitrary trajectory defined by a line drawn on a floor. The line-following behavior was the default robot behavior, utilizing autonomous intelligence and autonomous source of energy.S. Bozinovski, M. Sestakov, L.

The obtained cognitive wave representing the expectation learning in the brain is named Electroexpectogram (EXG). The CNV brain potential was part of the BCI challenge presented by Vidal in his 1973 paper. BCIs versus neuroprosthetics Neuroprosthetics is an area of neuroscience concerned with neural prostheses, that is, using artificial devices to replace the function of impaired nervous systems and brain-related problems, or of sensory organs or organs itself (bladder, diaphragm, etc). As of December 2010, cochlear implants had been implanted as neuroprosthetic device in approximately 220,000 people worldwide. There are also several neuroprosthetic devices that aim to restore vision, including retinal implants. The first neuroprosthetic device, however, was the pacemaker. The terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Neuroprosthetics and BCIs seek to achieve the same aims, such as restoring sight, hearing, movement, ability to communicate, and even cognitive function. Both use similar experimental methods and surgical techniques. Animal BCI research Several laboratories have managed to record signals from monkey and rat cerebral cortices to operate BCIs to produce movement. Monkeys have navigated computer cursors on screen and commanded robotic arms to perform simple tasks simply by thinking about the task and seeing the visual feedback, but without any motor output.Miguel Nicolelis et al. (2001) Duke neurobiologist has developed system that allows monkeys to control robot arms via brain signals In May 2008 photographs that showed a monkey at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center operating a robotic arm by thinking were published in a number of well-known science journals and magazines. =Early work= Monkey operating a robotic arm with brain‚Äìcomputer interfacing (Schwartz lab, University of Pittsburgh) In 1969 the operant conditioning studies of Fetz and colleagues, at the Regional Primate Research Center and Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, showed for the first time that monkeys could learn to control the deflection of a biofeedback meter arm with neural activity. Similar work in the 1970s established that monkeys could quickly learn to voluntarily control the firing rates of individual and multiple neurons in the primary motor cortex if they were rewarded for generating appropriate patterns of neural activity. Studies that developed algorithms to reconstruct movements from motor cortex neurons, which control movement, date back to the 1970s. In the 1980s, Apostolos Georgopoulos at Johns Hopkins University found a mathematical relationship between the electrical responses of single motor cortex neurons in rhesus macaque monkeys and the direction in which they moved their arms (based on a cosine function). He also found that dispersed groups of neurons, in different areas of the monkey's brains, collectively controlled motor commands, but was able to record the firings of neurons in only one area at a time, because of the technical limitations imposed by his equipment. There has been rapid development in BCIs since the mid-1990s. Several groups have been able to capture complex brain motor cortex signals by recording from neural ensembles (groups of neurons) and using these to control external devices. =Prominent research successes=Kennedy and Yang Dan Phillip Kennedy (who later founded Neural Signals in 1987) and colleagues built the first intracortical brain‚Äìcomputer interface by implanting neurotrophic-cone electrodes into monkeys. Yang Dan and colleagues' recordings of cat vision using a BCI implanted in the lateral geniculate nucleus (top row: original image; bottom row: recording) In 1999, researchers led by Yang Dan at the University of California, Berkeley decoded neuronal firings to reproduce images seen by cats. The team used an array of electrodes embedded in the thalamus (which integrates all of the brain's sensory input) of sharp-eyed cats. Researchers targeted 177 brain cells in the thalamus lateral geniculate nucleus area, which decodes signals from the retina. The cats were shown eight short movies, and their neuron firings were recorded. Using mathematical filters, the researchers decoded the signals to generate movies of what the cats saw and were able to reconstruct recognizable scenes and moving objects. Similar results in humans have since been achieved by researchers in Japan (see below). Nicolelis Miguel Nicolelis, a professor at Duke University, in Durham, North Carolina, has been a prominent proponent of using multiple electrodes spread over a greater area of the brain to obtain neuronal signals to drive a BCI. After conducting initial studies in rats during the 1990s, Nicolelis and his colleagues developed BCIs that decoded brain activity in owl monkeys and used the devices to reproduce monkey movements in robotic arms. Monkeys have advanced reaching and grasping abilities and good hand manipulation skills, making them ideal test subjects for this kind of work. By 2000, the group succeeded in building a BCI that reproduced owl monkey movements while the monkey operated a joystick or reached for food. The BCI operated in real time and could also control a separate robot remotely over Internet protocol. But the monkeys could not see the arm moving and did not receive any feedback, a so-called open-loop BCI. Diagram of the BCI developed by Miguel Nicolelis and colleagues for use on rhesus monkeys Later experiments by Nicolelis using rhesus monkeys succeeded in closing the feedback loop and reproduced monkey reaching and grasping movements in a robot arm. With their deeply cleft and furrowed brains, rhesus monkeys are considered to be better models for human neurophysiology than owl monkeys. The monkeys were trained to reach and grasp objects on a computer screen by manipulating a joystick while corresponding movements by a robot arm were hidden. The monkeys were later shown the robot directly and learned to control it by viewing its movements. The BCI used velocity predictions to control reaching movements and simultaneously predicted handgripping force. In 2011 O'Doherty and colleagues showed a BCI with sensory feedback with rhesus monkeys. The monkey was brain controlling the position of an avatar arm while receiving sensory feedback through direct intracortical stimulation (ICMS) in the arm representation area of the sensory cortex. Donoghue, Schwartz and Andersen Other laboratories which have developed BCIs and algorithms that decode neuron signals include those run by John Donoghue at Brown University, Andrew Schwartz at the University of Pittsburgh and Richard Andersen at Caltech. These researchers have been able to produce working BCIs, even using recorded signals from far fewer neurons than did Nicolelis (15‚Äì30 neurons versus 50‚Äì200 neurons). Donoghue's group reported training rhesus monkeys to use a BCI to track visual targets on a computer screen (closed-loop BCI) with or without assistance of a joystick. Schwartz's group created a BCI for three- dimensional tracking in virtual reality and also reproduced BCI control in a robotic arm. The same group also created headlines when they demonstrated that a monkey could feed itself pieces of fruit and marshmallows using a robotic arm controlled by the animal's own brain signals.Pitt team to build on brain- controlled arm , Pittsburgh Tribune Review, 5 September 2006. Andersen's group used recordings of premovement activity from the posterior parietal cortex in their BCI, including signals created when experimental animals anticipated receiving a reward. Other research In addition to predicting kinematic and kinetic parameters of limb movements, BCIs that predict electromyographic or electrical activity of the muscles of primates are being developed. Such BCIs could be used to restore mobility in paralyzed limbs by electrically stimulating muscles. Miguel Nicolelis and colleagues demonstrated that the activity of large neural ensembles can predict arm position. This work made possible creation of BCIs that read arm movement intentions and translate them into movements of artificial actuators. Carmena and colleagues programmed the neural coding in a BCI that allowed a monkey to control reaching and grasping movements by a robotic arm. Lebedev and colleagues argued that brain networks reorganize to create a new representation of the robotic appendage in addition to the representation of the animal's own limbs. In 2019, researchers from UCSF published a study where they demonstrated a BCI that had the potential to help patients with speech impairment caused by neurological disorders. Their BCI used high-density electrocorticography to tap neural activity from a patient's brain and used deep learning methods to synthesize speech. The biggest impediment to BCI technology at present is the lack of a sensor modality that provides safe, accurate and robust access to brain signals. It is conceivable or even likely, however, that such a sensor will be developed within the next twenty years. The use of such a sensor should greatly expand the range of communication functions that can be provided using a BCI. Development and implementation of a BCI system is complex and time consuming. In response to this problem, Gerwin Schalk has been developing a general- purpose system for BCI research, called BCI2000. BCI2000 has been in development since 2000 in a project led by the Brain‚ÄìComputer Interface R&D; Program at the Wadsworth Center of the New York State Department of Health in Albany, New York, United States. A new 'wireless' approach uses light-gated ion channels such as Channelrhodopsin to control the activity of genetically defined subsets of neurons in vivo. In the context of a simple learning task, illumination of transfected cells in the somatosensory cortex influenced the decision making process of freely moving mice. The use of BMIs has also led to a deeper understanding of neural networks and the central nervous system. Research has shown that despite the inclination of neuroscientists to believe that neurons have the most effect when working together, single neurons can be conditioned through the use of BMIs to fire at a pattern that allows primates to control motor outputs. The use of BMIs has led to development of the single neuron insufficiency principle which states that even with a well tuned firing rate single neurons can only carry a narrow amount of information and therefore the highest level of accuracy is achieved by recording firings of the collective ensemble. Other principles discovered with the use of BMIs include the neuronal multitasking principle, the neuronal mass principle, the neural degeneracy principle, and the plasticity principle. BCIs are also proposed to be applied by users without disabilities. A user-centered categorization of BCI approaches by Thorsten O. Zander and Christian Kothe introduces the term passive BCI. Next to active and reactive BCI that are used for directed control, passive BCIs allow for assessing and interpreting changes in the user state during Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In a secondary, implicit control loop the computer system adapts to its user improving its usability in general. Beyond BCI systems that decode neural activity to drive external effectors, BCI systems may be used to encode signals from the periphery. These sensory BCI devices enable real-time, behaviorally-relevant decisions based upon closed-loop neural stimulation. The BCI Award The Annual BCI Research Award is awarded in recognition of outstanding and innovative research in the field of Brain-Computer Interfaces. Each year, a renowned research laboratory is asked to judge the submitted projects. The jury consists of world-leading BCI experts recruited by the awarding laboratory. The jury selects twelve nominees, then chooses a first, second, and third-place winner, who receive awards of $3,000, $2,000, and $1,000, respectively. Human BCI research=Invasive BCIs= Invasive BCI requires surgery to implant electrodes under scalp for communicating brain signals. The main advantage is to provide more accurate reading; however, its downside includes side effects from the surgery. After the surgery, scar tissues may form which can make brain signals weaker. In addition, according to the research of Abdulkader et al., (2015), the body may not accept the implanted electrodes and this can cause a medical condition.  Vision  Invasive BCI research has targeted repairing damaged sight and providing new functionality for people with paralysis. Invasive BCIs are implanted directly into the grey matter of the brain during neurosurgery. Because they lie in the grey matter, invasive devices produce the highest quality signals of BCI devices but are prone to scar-tissue build-up, causing the signal to become weaker, or even non-existent, as the body reacts to a foreign object in the brain. In vision science, direct brain implants have been used to treat non- congenital (acquired) blindness. One of the first scientists to produce a working brain interface to restore sight was private researcher William Dobelle. Dobelle's first prototype was implanted into \\"Jerry\\", a man blinded in adulthood, in 1978. A single-array BCI containing 68 electrodes was implanted onto Jerry's visual cortex and succeeded in producing phosphenes, the sensation of seeing light. The system included cameras mounted on glasses to send signals to the implant. Initially, the implant allowed Jerry to see shades of grey in a limited field of vision at a low frame-rate. This also required him to be hooked up to a mainframe computer, but shrinking electronics and faster computers made his artificial eye more portable and now enable him to perform simple tasks unassisted.Vision quest, Wired Magazine, September 2002 Dummy unit illustrating the design of a BrainGate interface In 2002, Jens Naumann, also blinded in adulthood, became the first in a series of 16 paying patients to receive Dobelle's second generation implant, marking one of the earliest commercial uses of BCIs. The second generation device used a more sophisticated implant enabling better mapping of phosphenes into coherent vision. Phosphenes are spread out across the visual field in what researchers call \\"the starry-night effect\\". Immediately after his implant, Jens was able to use his imperfectly restored vision to drive an automobile slowly around the parking area of the research institute. Unfortunately, Dobelle died in 2004Tuller, David (1 November 2004) Dr. William Dobelle, Artificial Vision Pioneer, Dies at 62.

Subsequently, when Mr. Naumann and the other patients in the program began having problems with their vision, there was no relief and they eventually lost their \\"sight\\" again. Naumann wrote about his experience with Dobelle's work in Search for Paradise: A Patient's Account of the Artificial Vision ExperimentNaumann, J. Search for Paradise: A Patient's Account of the Artificial Vision Experiment (2012), Xlibris Corporation, and has returned to his farm in Southeast Ontario, Canada, to resume his normal activities. Movement BCIs focusing on motor neuroprosthetics aim to either restore movement in individuals with paralysis or provide devices to assist them, such as interfaces with computers or robot arms. Researchers at Emory University in Atlanta, led by Philip Kennedy and Roy Bakay, were first to install a brain implant in a human that produced signals of high enough quality to simulate movement. Their patient, Johnny Ray (1944‚Äì2002), suffered from 'locked-in syndrome' after suffering a brain-stem stroke in 1997. Ray's implant was installed in 1998 and he lived long enough to start working with the implant, eventually learning to control a computer cursor; he died in 2002 of a brain aneurysm. Tetraplegic Matt Nagle became the first person to control an artificial hand using a BCI in 2005 as part of the first nine-month human trial of Cyberkinetics's BrainGate chip-implant. Implanted in Nagle's right precentral gyrus (area of the motor cortex for arm movement), the 96-electrode BrainGate implant allowed Nagle to control a robotic arm by thinking about moving his hand as well as a computer cursor, lights and TV. One year later, professor Jonathan Wolpaw received the prize of the Altran Foundation for Innovation to develop a Brain Computer Interface with electrodes located on the surface of the skull, instead of directly in the brain. More recently, research teams led by the Braingate group at Brown University and a group led by University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, both in collaborations with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, have demonstrated further success in direct control of robotic prosthetic limbs with many degrees of freedom using direct connections to arrays of neurons in the motor cortex of patients with tetraplegia. =Partially invasive BCIs= Partially invasive BCI devices are implanted inside the skull but rest outside the brain rather than within the grey matter. They produce better resolution signals than non- invasive BCIs where the bone tissue of the cranium deflects and deforms signals and have a lower risk of forming scar-tissue in the brain than fully invasive BCIs. There has been preclinical demonstration of intracortical BCIs from the stroke perilesional cortex. Electrocorticography (ECoG) measures the electrical activity of the brain taken from beneath the skull in a similar way to non-invasive electroencephalography, but the electrodes are embedded in a thin plastic pad that is placed above the cortex, beneath the dura mater.Serruya MD, Donoghue JP. (2003) Chapter III: Design Principles of a Neuromotor Prosthetic Device in Neuroprosthetics: Theory and Practice, ed. Kenneth W. Horch, Gurpreet S. Dhillon. Imperial College Press. ECoG technologies were first trialled in humans in 2004 by Eric Leuthardt and Daniel Moran from Washington University in St Louis. In a later trial, the researchers enabled a teenage boy to play Space Invaders using his ECoG implant.Teenager moves video icons just by imagination, press release, Washington University in St Louis, 9 October 2006 This research indicates that control is rapid, requires minimal training, and may be an ideal tradeoff with regards to signal fidelity and level of invasiveness. Signals can be either subdural or epidural, but are not taken from within the brain parenchyma itself. It has not been studied extensively until recently due to the limited access of subjects. Currently, the only manner to acquire the signal for study is through the use of patients requiring invasive monitoring for localization and resection of an epileptogenic focus. ECoG is a very promising intermediate BCI modality because it has higher spatial resolution, better signal-to-noise ratio, wider frequency range, and less training requirements than scalp- recorded EEG, and at the same time has lower technical difficulty, lower clinical risk, and probably superior long-term stability than intracortical single-neuron recording. This feature profile and recent evidence of the high level of control with minimal training requirements shows potential for real world application for people with motor disabilities. Light reactive imaging BCI devices are still in the realm of theory. =Non-invasive BCIs= There have also been experiments in humans using non-invasive neuroimaging technologies as interfaces. The substantial majority of published BCI work involves noninvasive EEG-based BCIs. Noninvasive EEG-based technologies and interfaces have been used for a much broader variety of applications. Although EEG-based interfaces are easy to wear and do not require surgery, they have relatively poor spatial resolution and cannot effectively use higher-frequency signals because the skull dampens signals, dispersing and blurring the electromagnetic waves created by the neurons. EEG-based interfaces also require some time and effort prior to each usage session, whereas non-EEG- based ones, as well as invasive ones require no prior-usage training. Overall, the best BCI for each user depends on numerous factors.  Non-EEG-based human‚Äìcomputer interface =Electrooculography (EOG)= In 1989 report was given on control of a mobile robot by eye movement using Electrooculography (EOG) signals. A mobile robot was driven from a start to a goal point using five EOG commands, interpreted as forward, backward, left, right, and stop. The EOG as a challenge of controlling external objects was presented by Vidal in his 1973 paper. =Pupil-size oscillation= A 2016 article described an entirely new communication device and non-EEG-based human-computer interface, which requires no visual fixation, or ability to move the eyes at all. The interface is based on covert interest; directing one's attention to a chosen letter on a virtual keyboard, without the need to move one's eyes to look directly at the letter. Each letter has its own (background) circle which micro-oscillates in brightness differently from all of the other letters. The letter selection is based on best fit between unintentional pupil-size oscillation and the background circle's brightness oscillation pattern. Accuracy is additionally improved by the user's mental rehearsing of the words 'bright' and 'dark' in synchrony with the brightness transitions of the letter's circle. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy In 2014 and 2017, a BCI using functional near-infrared spectroscopy for \\"locked-in\\" patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was able to restore some basic ability of the patients to communicate with other people. Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces=Overview= Recordings of brainwaves produced by an electroencephalogram After the BCI challenge was stated by Vidal in 1973, the initial reports on non-invasive approach included control of a cursor in 2D using VEP (Vidal 1977), control of a buzzer using CNV (Bozinovska et al. 1988, 1990), control of a physical object, a robot, using a brain rhythm (alpha) (Bozinovski et al. 1988), control of a text written on a screen using P300 (Farwell and Donchin, 1988). In the early days of BCI research, another substantial barrier to using Electroencephalography (EEG) as a brain‚Äìcomputer interface was the extensive training required before users can work the technology. For example, in experiments beginning in the mid-1990s, Niels Birbaumer at the University of T√ºbingen in Germany trained severely paralysed people to self-regulate the slow cortical potentials in their EEG to such an extent that these signals could be used as a binary signal to control a computer cursor.Just short of telepathy: can you interact with the outside world if you can't even blink an eye?, Psychology Today, May‚ÄìJune 2003 (Birbaumer had earlier trained epileptics to prevent impending fits by controlling this low voltage wave.) The experiment saw ten patients trained to move a computer cursor by controlling their brainwaves. The process was slow, requiring more than an hour for patients to write 100 characters with the cursor, while training often took many months. However, the slow cortical potential approach to BCIs has not been used in several years, since other approaches require little or no training, are faster and more accurate, and work for a greater proportion of users. Another research parameter is the type of oscillatory activity that is measured. Gert Pfurtscheller founded the BCI Lab 1991 and fed his research results on motor imagery in the first online BCI based on oscillatory features and classifiers. Together with Birbaumer and Jonathan Wolpaw at New York State University they focused on developing technology that would allow users to choose the brain signals they found easiest to operate a BCI, including mu and beta rhythms. A further parameter is the method of feedback used and this is shown in studies of P300 signals. Patterns of P300 waves are generated involuntarily (stimulus-feedback) when people see something they recognize and may allow BCIs to decode categories of thoughts without training patients first. By contrast, the biofeedback methods described above require learning to control brainwaves so the resulting brain activity can be detected. In 2005 it was reported research on EEG emulation of digital control circuits for BCI, with example of a CNV flip-flop.Adrijan Bozinovski \\"CNV flip-flop as a brain-computer interface paradigm\\" In J. Kern, S. Tonkovic, et al. (Eds) Proc 7th Conference of the Croatian Association of Medical Informatics, pp. 149-154, Rijeka, 2005 In 2009 it was reported noninvasive EEG control of a robotic arm using a CNV flip-flop.A. Bozinovski, L. Bozinovska, Anticipatory Brain Potentials in a Brain-Robot Interface Paradigm, Proc. 4th International IEEE EMBS Conf. on Neural Engineering, pp. 451-454, Antalya, 2009 In 2011 it was reported control of two robotic arms solving Tower of Hanoi task with three disks using a CNV flip-flop.A. Bozinovski, S. Tonkovi¬¥c, V. I≈°gum, L. Bozinovska \\"Robot control using anticipatory brain potentials\\" Automatika 52(1):20‚Äì30, 2011 In 2015 it was described EEG-emulation of a Schmidt trigger, flip-flop, demultiplexer, and modem.Bozinovski, S., Bozinovski, A. \\"Mental states, EEG manifestations, and mentally emulated digital circuits for brain-robot interaction\\" IEEE Trans. Autonomous Mental Development 7(1):39‚Äì51, 2015 While an EEG based brain- computer interface has been pursued extensively by a number of research labs, recent advancements made by Bin He and his team at the University of Minnesota suggest the potential of an EEG based brain-computer interface to accomplish tasks close to invasive brain-computer interface. Using advanced functional neuroimaging including BOLD functional MRI and EEG source imaging, Bin He and co-workers identified the co-variation and co-localization of electrophysiological and hemodynamic signals induced by motor imagination. Refined by a neuroimaging approach and by a training protocol, Bin He and co- workers demonstrated the ability of a non-invasive EEG based brain-computer interface to control the flight of a virtual helicopter in 3-dimensional space, based upon motor imagination. In June 2013 it was announced that Bin He had developed the technique to enable a remote-control helicopter to be guided through an obstacle course. In addition to a brain-computer interface based on brain waves, as recorded from scalp EEG electrodes, Bin He and co-workers explored a virtual EEG signal-based brain-computer interface by first solving the EEG inverse problem and then used the resulting virtual EEG for brain- computer interface tasks. Well-controlled studies suggested the merits of such a source analysis based brain-computer interface. A 2014 study found that severely motor-impaired patients could communicate faster and more reliably with non-invasive EEG BCI, than with any muscle-based communication channel. A 2016 study found that the Emotiv EPOC device may be more suitable for control tasks using the attention/meditation level or eye blinking than the Neurosky MindWave device. A 2019 study found that the application of evolutionary algorithms could improve EEG mental state classification with a non-invasive Muse (headband) device, enabling high quality classification of data acquired by a cheap consumer-grade EEG sensing device. Dry active electrode arrays In the early 1990s Babak Taheri, at University of California, Davis demonstrated the first single and also multichannel dry active electrode arrays using micro-machining. The single channel dry EEG electrode construction and results were published in 1994. The arrayed electrode was also demonstrated to perform well compared to silver/silver chloride electrodes. The device consisted of four sites of sensors with integrated electronics to reduce noise by impedance matching. The advantages of such electrodes are: (1) no electrolyte used, (2) no skin preparation, (3) significantly reduced sensor size, and (4) compatibility with EEG monitoring systems. The active electrode array is an integrated system made of an array of capacitive sensors with local integrated circuitry housed in a package with batteries to power the circuitry. This level of integration was required to achieve the functional performance obtained by the electrode. The electrode was tested on an electrical test bench and on human subjects in four modalities of EEG activity, namely: (1) spontaneous EEG, (2) sensory event- related potentials, (3) brain stem potentials, and (4) cognitive event-related potentials. The performance of the dry electrode compared favorably with that of the standard wet electrodes in terms of skin preparation, no gel requirements (dry), and higher signal-to-noise ratio. In 1999 researchers at Case Western Reserve University, in Cleveland, Ohio, led by Hunter Peckham, used 64-electrode EEG skullcap to return limited hand movements to quadriplegic Jim Jatich. As Jatich concentrated on simple but opposite concepts like up and down, his beta-rhythm EEG output was analysed using software to identify patterns in the noise. A basic pattern was identified and used to control a switch: Above average activity was set to on, below average off. As well as enabling Jatich to control a computer cursor the signals were also used to drive the nerve controllers embedded in his hands, restoring some movement.The Next BrainiacsWired Magazine, August 2001.  SSVEP mobile EEG BCIs  In 2009, the NCTU Brain-Computer-Interface-headband was reported. The researchers who developed this BCI-headband also engineered silicon-based MicroElectro-Mechanical System (MEMS) dry electrodes designed for application in non-hairy sites of the body. These electrodes were secured to the DAQ board in the headband with snap-on electrode holders. The signal processing module measured alpha activity and the Bluetooth enabled phone assessed the patients' alertness and capacity for cognitive performance. When the subject became drowsy, the phone sent arousing feedback to the operator to rouse them. This research was supported by the National Science Council, Taiwan, R.O.C., NSC, National Chiao-Tung University, Taiwan's Ministry of Education, and the U.S. Army Research Laboratory. In 2011, researchers reported a cellular based BCI with the capability of taking EEG data and converting it into a command to cause the phone to ring. This research was supported in part by Abraxis Bioscience LLP, the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, and the Army Research Office. The developed technology was a wearable system composed of a four channel bio-signal acquisition/amplification module, a wireless transmission module, and a Bluetooth enabled cell phone. The electrodes were placed so that they pick up steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). SSVEPs are electrical responses to flickering visual stimuli with repetition rates over 6 Hz that are best found in the parietal and occipital scalp regions of the visual cortex. It was reported that with this BCI setup, all study participants were able to initiate the phone call with minimal practice in natural environments.\\"U.S. patent No. 2013/0127708 A1 (issued 23 May 2013).\\" The scientists claim that their studies using a single channel fast Fourier transform (FFT) and multiple channel system canonical correlation analysis (CCA) algorithm support the capacity of mobile BCIs. The CCA algorithm has been applied in other experiments investigating BCIs with claimed high performance in accuracy as well as speed. While the cellular based BCI technology was developed to initiate a phone call from SSVEPs, the researchers said that it can be translated for other applications, such as picking up sensorimotor mu/beta rhythms to function as a motor-imagery based BCI. In 2013, comparative tests were performed on android cell phone, tablet, and computer based BCIs, analyzing the power spectrum density of resultant EEG SSVEPs. The stated goals of this study, which involved scientists supported in part by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, were to \\"increase the practicability, portability, and ubiquity of an SSVEP-based BCI, for daily use\\". Citation It was reported that the stimulation frequency on all mediums was accurate, although the cell phone's signal demonstrated some instability. The amplitudes of the SSVEPs for the laptop and tablet were also reported to be larger than those of the cell phone. These two qualitative characterizations were suggested as indicators of the feasibility of using a mobile stimulus BCI.  Limitations  In 2011, researchers stated that continued work should address ease of use, performance robustness, reducing hardware and software costs. One of the difficulties with EEG readings is the large susceptibility to motion artifacts. In most the previously described research projects, the participants were asked to sit still, reducing head and eye movements as much as possible, and measurements were taken in a laboratory setting. However, since the emphasized application of these initiatives had been in creating a mobile device for daily use, the technology had to be tested in motion. In 2013, researchers tested mobile EEG-based BCI technology, measuring SSVEPs from participants as they walked on a treadmill at varying speeds. This research was supported by the Office of Naval Research, Army Research Office, and the U.S. Army Research Laboratory. Stated results were that as speed increased the SSVEP detectability using CCA decreased. As independent component analysis (ICA) had been shown to be efficient in separating EEG signals from noise, the scientists applied ICA to CCA extracted EEG data. They stated that the CCA data with and without ICA processing were similar. Thus, they concluded that CCA independently demonstrated a robustness to motion artifacts that indicates it may be a beneficial algorithm to apply to BCIs used in real world conditions. In 2020, researchers from the University of California used a computing system related to brain-machine interfaces to translate brainwaves into sentences. However, their decoding was limited to 30‚Äì50 sentences, even though the word error rates were as low as 3%. Prosthesis and environment control Non-invasive BCIs have also been applied to enable brain-control of prosthetic upper and lower extremity devices in people with paralysis. For example, Gert Pfurtscheller of Graz University of Technology and colleagues demonstrated a BCI-controlled functional electrical stimulation system to restore upper extremity movements in a person with tetraplegia due to spinal cord injury. Between 2012 and 2013, researchers at the University of California, Irvine demonstrated for the first time that it is possible to use BCI technology to restore brain-controlled walking after spinal cord injury. In their spinal cord injury research study, a person with paraplegia was able to operate a BCI-robotic gait orthosis to regain basic brain-controlled ambulation.Subject with Paraplegia Operates BCI- controlled RoGO (4x) at YouTube.com In 2009 Alex Blainey, an independent researcher based in the UK, successfully used the Emotiv EPOC to control a 5 axis robot arm.Alex Blainey controls a cheap consumer robot arm using the EPOC headset via a serial relay port at YouTube.com He then went on to make several demonstration mind controlled wheelchairs and home automation that could be operated by people with limited or no motor control such as those with paraplegia and cerebral palsy. Research into military use of BCIs funded by DARPA has been ongoing since the 1970s. The current focus of research is user- to-user communication through analysis of neural signals. DIY and open source BCI In 2001, The OpenEEG Project was initiated by a group of DIY neuroscientists and engineers. The ModularEEG was the primary device created by the OpenEEG community; it was a 6-channel signal capture board that cost between $200 and $400 to make at home. The OpenEEG Project marked a significant moment in the emergence of DIY brain-computer interfacing. In 2010, the Frontier Nerds of NYU's ITP program published a thorough tutorial titled How To Hack Toy EEGs. The tutorial, which stirred the minds of many budding DIY BCI enthusiasts, demonstrated how to create a single channel at- home EEG with an Arduino and a Mattel Mindflex at a very reasonable price. This tutorial amplified the DIY BCI movement. In 2013, OpenBCI emerged from a DARPA solicitation and subsequent Kickstarter campaign. They created a high- quality, open-source 8-channel EEG acquisition board, known as the 32bit Board, that retailed for under $500. Two years later they created the first 3D-printed EEG Headset, known as the Ultracortex, as well as a 4-channel EEG acquisition board, known as the Ganglion Board, that retailed for under $100. MEG and MRI fMRI (top row: original image; bottom row: reconstruction from mean of combined readings) Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have both been used successfully as non- invasive BCIs.Ranganatha Sitaram, Andrea Caria, Ralf Veit, Tilman Gaber, Giuseppina Rota, Andrea Kuebler and Niels Birbaumer(2007) \\"FMRI Brain‚ÄìComputer Interface: A Tool for Neuroscientific Research and Treatment\\" In a widely reported experiment, fMRI allowed two users being scanned to play Pong in real-time by altering their haemodynamic response or brain blood flow through biofeedback techniques. fMRI measurements of haemodynamic responses in real time have also been used to control robot arms with a seven-second delay between thought and movement.To operate robot only with brain, ATR and Honda develop BMI base technology, Tech-on, 26 May 2006 In 2008 research developed in the Advanced Telecommunications Research (ATR) Computational Neuroscience Laboratories in Kyoto, Japan, allowed the scientists to reconstruct images directly from the brain and display them on a computer in black and white at a resolution of 10x10 pixels. The article announcing these achievements was the cover story of the journal Neuron of 10 December 2008. In 2011 researchers from UC Berkeley published a study reporting second-by-second reconstruction of videos watched by the study's subjects, from fMRI data. This was achieved by creating a statistical model relating visual patterns in videos shown to the subjects, to the brain activity caused by watching the videos. This model was then used to look up the 100 one-second video segments, in a database of 18 million seconds of random YouTube videos, whose visual patterns most closely matched the brain activity recorded when subjects watched a new video. These 100 one-second video extracts were then combined into a mashed-up image that resembled the video being watched. BCI control strategies in neurogaming=Motor imagery= Motor imagery involves the imagination of the movement of various body parts resulting in sensorimotor cortex activation, which modulates sensorimotor oscillations in the EEG. This can be detected by the BCI to infer a user's intent. Motor imagery typically requires a number of sessions of training before acceptable control of the BCI is acquired. These training sessions may take a number of hours over several days before users can consistently employ the technique with acceptable levels of precision. Regardless of the duration of the training session, users are unable to master the control scheme. This results in very slow pace of the gameplay. Advanced machine learning methods were recently developed to compute a subject-specific model for detecting the performance of motor imagery. The top performing algorithm from BCI Competition IV dataset 2 for motor imagery is the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern, developed by Ang et al. from A*STAR, Singapore). =Bio/neurofeedback for passive BCI designs= Biofeedback is used to monitor a subject's mental relaxation. In some cases, biofeedback does not monitor electroencephalography (EEG), but instead bodily parameters such as electromyography (EMG), galvanic skin resistance (GSR), and heart rate variability (HRV). Many biofeedback systems are used to treat certain disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sleep problems in children, teeth grinding, and chronic pain. EEG biofeedback systems typically monitor four different bands (theta: 4‚Äì7 Hz, alpha:8‚Äì12 Hz, SMR: 12‚Äì15 Hz, beta: 15‚Äì18 Hz) and challenge the subject to control them. Passive BCI involves using BCI to enrich human‚Äìmachine interaction with implicit information on the actual user's state, for example, simulations to detect when users intend to push brakes during an emergency car stopping procedure. Game developers using passive BCIs need to acknowledge that through repetition of game levels the user's cognitive state will change or adapt. Within the first play of a level, the user will react to things differently from during the second play: for example, the user will be less surprised at an event in the game if he/she is expecting it. =Visual evoked potential (VEP)= A VEP is an electrical potential recorded after a subject is presented with a type of visual stimuli. There are several types of VEPs. Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) use potentials generated by exciting the retina, using visual stimuli modulated at certain frequencies. SSVEP's stimuli are often formed from alternating checkerboard patterns and at times simply use flashing images. The frequency of the phase reversal of the stimulus used can be clearly distinguished in the spectrum of an EEG; this makes detection of SSVEP stimuli relatively easy. SSVEP has proved to be successful within many BCI systems. This is due to several factors, the signal elicited is measurable in as large a population as the transient VEP and blink movement and electrocardiographic artefacts do not affect the frequencies monitored. In addition, the SSVEP signal is exceptionally robust; the topographic organization of the primary visual cortex is such that a broader area obtains afferents from the central or fovial region of the visual field. SSVEP does have several problems however. As SSVEPs use flashing stimuli to infer a user's intent, the user must gaze at one of the flashing or iterating symbols in order to interact with the system. It is, therefore, likely that the symbols could become irritating and uncomfortable to use during longer play sessions, which can often last more than an hour which may not be an ideal gameplay. Another type of VEP used with applications is the P300 potential. The P300 event-related potential is a positive peak in the EEG that occurs at roughly 300 ms after the appearance of a target stimulus (a stimulus for which the user is waiting or seeking) or oddball stimuli. The P300 amplitude decreases as the target stimuli and the ignored stimuli grow more similar.The P300 is thought to be related to a higher level attention process or an orienting response using P300 as a control scheme has the advantage of the participant only having to attend limited training sessions. The first application to use the P300 model was the P300 matrix. Within this system, a subject would choose a letter from a grid of 6 by 6 letters and numbers. The rows and columns of the grid flashed sequentially and every time the selected \\"choice letter\\" was illuminated the user's P300 was (potentially) elicited. However, the communication process, at approximately 17 characters per minute, was quite slow. The P300 is a BCI that offers a discrete selection rather than a continuous control mechanism. The advantage of P300 use within games is that the player does not have to teach himself/herself how to use a completely new control system and so only has to undertake short training instances, to learn the gameplay mechanics and basic use of the BCI paradigm. =Synthetic telepathy/silent communication= In a $6.3 million Army initiative to invent devices for telepathic communication, Gerwin Schalk, underwritten in a $2.2 million grant, found the use of ECoG signals can discriminate the vowels and consonants embedded in spoken and imagined words, shedding light on the distinct mechanisms associated with production of vowels and consonants, and could provide the basis for brain-based communication using imagined speech. In 2002 Kevin Warwick had an array of 100 electrodes fired into his nervous system in order to link his nervous system into the Internet to investigate enhancement possibilities. With this in place Warwick successfully carried out a series of experiments. With electrodes also implanted into his wife's nervous system, they conducted the first direct electronic communication experiment between the nervous systems of two humans.Warwick, K, Gasson, M, Hutt, B, Goodhew, I, Kyberd, P, Schulzrinne, H and Wu, X: \\"Thought Communication and Control: A First Step using Radiotelegraphy\\", IEE Proceedings on Communications, 151(3), pp.185‚Äì189, 2004 Another group of researchers was able to achieve conscious brain-to-brain communication between two people separated by a distance using non-invasive technology that was in contact with the scalp of the participants. The words were encoded by binary streams using the sequences of 0's and 1's by the imaginary motor input of the person \\"emitting\\" the information. As the result of this experiment, pseudo- random bits of the information carried encoded words ‚Äúhola‚Äù (‚Äúhi‚Äù in Spanish) and ‚Äúciao‚Äù (‚Äúhi‚Äù or ‚Äúgoodbye in Italian) and were transmitted mind-to-mind between humans separated by a distance, with blocked motor and sensory systems, which has little to no probability of this happening by chance. Research into synthetic telepathy using subvocalization is taking place at the University of California, Irvine under lead scientist Mike D'Zmura. The first such communication took place in the 1960s using EEG to create Morse code using brain alpha waves. Using EEG to communicate imagined speech is less accurate than the invasive method of placing an electrode between the skull and the brain. On 27 February 2013 the group with Miguel Nicolelis at Duke University and IINN-ELS successfully connected the brains of two rats with electronic interfaces that allowed them to directly share information, in the first-ever direct brain-to-brain interface. Cell-culture BCIs Researchers have built devices to interface with neural cells and entire neural networks in cultures outside animals. As well as furthering research on animal implantable devices, experiments on cultured neural tissue have focused on building problem-solving networks, constructing basic computers and manipulating robotic devices. Research into techniques for stimulating and recording from individual neurons grown on semiconductor chips is sometimes referred to as neuroelectronics or neurochips. The world's first Neurochip, developed by Caltech researchers Jerome Pine and Michael Maher Development of the first working neurochip was claimed by a Caltech team led by Jerome Pine and Michael Maher in 1997.Caltech Scientists Devise First Neurochip, Caltech, 26 October 1997 The Caltech chip had room for 16 neurons. In 2003 a team led by Theodore Berger, at the University of Southern California, started work on a neurochip designed to function as an artificial or prosthetic hippocampus. The neurochip was designed to function in rat brains and was intended as a prototype for the eventual development of higher-brain prosthesis. The hippocampus was chosen because it is thought to be the most ordered and structured part of the brain and is the most studied area. Its function is to encode experiences for storage as long-term memories elsewhere in the brain.Coming to a brain near you , Wired News, 22 October 2004 In 2004 Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida used a culture of 25,000 neurons taken from a rat's brain to fly a F-22 fighter jet aircraft simulator.'Brain' in a dish flies flight simulator, CNN, 4 November 2004 After collection, the cortical neurons were cultured in a petri dish and rapidly began to reconnect themselves to form a living neural network. The cells were arranged over a grid of 60 electrodes and used to control the pitch and yaw functions of the simulator. The study's focus was on understanding how the human brain performs and learns computational tasks at a cellular level.

They are actually similar to corrective therapies in function. Clausen stated in 2009 that \\"BCIs pose ethical challenges, but these are conceptually similar to those that bioethicists have addressed for other realms of therapy\\". Moreover, he suggests that bioethics is well-prepared to deal with the issues that arise with BCI technologies. Haselager and colleagues pointed out that expectations of BCI efficacy and value play a great role in ethical analysis and the way BCI scientists should approach media. Furthermore, standard protocols can be implemented to ensure ethically sound informed-consent procedures with locked-in patients. The case of BCIs today has parallels in medicine, as will its evolution. Similar to how pharmaceutical science began as a balance for impairments and is now used to increase focus and reduce need for sleep, BCIs will likely transform gradually from therapies to enhancements. Efforts are made inside the BCI community to create consensus on ethical guidelines for BCI research, development and dissemination. Low-cost BCI-based interfaces Recently a number of companies have scaled back medical grade EEG technology (and in one case, NeuroSky, rebuilt the technology from the ground up) to create inexpensive BCIs. This technology has been built into toys and gaming devices; some of these toys have been extremely commercially successful like the NeuroSky and Mattel MindFlex. * In 2006 Sony patented a neural interface system allowing radio waves to affect signals in the neural cortex. * In 2007 NeuroSky released the first affordable consumer based EEG along with the game NeuroBoy. This was also the first large scale EEG device to use dry sensor technology. * In 2008 OCZ Technology developed a device for use in video games relying primarily on electromyography. *In 2008 Final Fantasy developer Square Enix announced that it was partnering with NeuroSky to create a game, Judecca.Brains-on with NeuroSky and Square Enix's Judecca mind-control game.

Future directions Brain-computer interface A consortium consisting of 12 European partners has completed a roadmap to support the European Commission in their funding decisions for the new framework program Horizon 2020. The project, which was funded by the European Commission, started in November 2013 and published a roadmap in April 2015. A 2015 publication led by Dr. Clemens Brunner describes some of the analyses and achievements of this project, as well as the emerging Brain-Computer Interface Society. For example, this article reviewed work within this project that further defined BCIs and applications, explored recent trends, discussed ethical issues, and evaluated different directions for new BCIs. As the article notes, their new roadmap generally extends and supports the recommendations from the Future BNCI project managed by Dr. Brendan Allison, which conveys substantial enthusiasm for emerging BCI directions. Other recent publications too have explored future BCI directions for new groups of disabled users (e.g.,Allison, B.Z., Dunne, S., Leeb, R., Millan, J., and Nijholt, A. (2013).

Springer Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg.). Some prominent examples are summarized below. =Disorders of consciousness (DOC)= Some persons have a disorder of consciousness (DOC). This state is defined to include persons with coma, as well as persons in a vegetative state (VS) or minimally conscious state (MCS). New BCI research seeks to help persons with DOC in different ways. A key initial goal is to identify patients who are able to perform basic cognitive tasks, which would of course lead to a change in their diagnosis. That is, some persons who are diagnosed with DOC may in fact be able to process information and make important life decisions (such as whether to seek therapy, where to live, and their views on end-of-life decisions regarding them). Some persons who are diagnosed with DOC die as a result of end-of-life decisions, which may be made by family members who sincerely feel this is in the patient's best interests. Given the new prospect of allowing these patients to provide their views on this decision, there would seem to be a strong ethical pressure to develop this research direction to guarantee that DOC patients are given an opportunity to decide whether they want to live.Edlinger, G., Allison, B.Z., and Guger, C. (2015). \\"How many people could use a BCI system?\\" pp. 33‚Äì66 in Clinical Systems Neuroscience, Kansaku, K., Cohen, L., and Birbaumer, N. (eds.) Springer Verlag Japan: Tokyo. . These and other articles describe new challenges and solutions to use BCI technology to help persons with DOC. One major challenge is that these patients cannot use BCIs based on vision. Hence, new tools rely on auditory and/or vibrotactile stimuli. Patients may wear headphones and/or vibrotactile stimulators placed on the wrists, neck, leg, and/or other locations. Another challenge is that patients may fade in and out of consciousness, and can only communicate at certain times. This may indeed be a cause of mistaken diagnosis. Some patients may only be able to respond to physicians' requests during a few hours per day (which might not be predictable ahead of time) and thus may have been unresponsive during diagnosis. Therefore, new methods rely on tools that are easy to use in field settings, even without expert help, so family members and other persons without any medical or technical background can still use them. This reduces the cost, time, need for expertise, and other burdens with DOC assessment. Automated tools can ask simple questions that patients can easily answer, such as \\"Is your father named George?\\" or \\"Were you born in the USA?\\" Automated instructions inform patients that they may convey yes or no by (for example) focusing their attention on stimuli on the right vs. left wrist. This focused attention produces reliable changes in EEG patterns that can help determine that the patient is able to communicate. The results could be presented to physicians and therapists, which could lead to a revised diagnosis and therapy. In addition, these patients could then be provided with BCI-based communication tools that could help them convey basic needs, adjust bed position and HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), and otherwise empower them to make major life decisions and communicate. =Motor recovery= People may lose some of their ability to move due to many causes, such as stroke or injury. Several groups have explored systems and methods for motor recovery that include BCIs. In this approach, a BCI measures motor activity while the patient imagines or attempts movements as directed by a therapist. The BCI may provide two benefits: (1) if the BCI indicates that a patient is not imagining a movement correctly (non-compliance), then the BCI could inform the patient and therapist; and (2) rewarding feedback such as functional stimulation or the movement of a virtual avatar also depends on the patient's correct movement imagery. So far, BCIs for motor recovery have relied on the EEG to measure the patient's motor imagery. However, studies have also used fMRI to study different changes in the brain as persons undergo BCI-based stroke rehab training. Future systems might include the fMRI and other measures for real-time control, such as functional near-infrared, probably in tandem with EEGs. Non-invasive brain stimulation has also been explored in combination with BCIs for motor recovery. In 2016, scientists out of the University of Melbourne published preclinical proof-of-concept data related to a potential brain-computer interface technology platform being developed for patients with paralysis to facilitate control of external devices such as robotic limbs, computers and exoskeletons by translating brain activity. Clinical trials are currently underway. =Functional brain mapping= Each year, about 400,000 people undergo brain mapping during neurosurgery. This procedure is often required for people with tumors or epilepsy that do not respond to medication. During this procedure, electrodes are placed on the brain to precisely identify the locations of structures and functional areas. Patients may be awake during neurosurgery and asked to perform certain tasks, such as moving fingers or repeating words. This is necessary so that surgeons can remove only the desired tissue while sparing other regions, such as critical movement or language regions. Removing too much brain tissue can cause permanent damage, while removing too little tissue can leave the underlying condition untreated and require additional neurosurgery. Thus, there is a strong need to improve both methods and systems to map the brain as effectively as possible. In several recent publications, BCI research experts and medical doctors have collaborated to explore new ways to use BCI technology to improve neurosurgical mapping. This work focuses largely on high gamma activity, which is difficult to detect with non-invasive means. Results have led to improved methods for identifying key areas for movement, language, and other functions. A recent article addressed advances in functional brain mapping and summarizes a workshop. =Flexible devices= Flexible electronics are polymers or other flexible materials (e.g. silk, pentacene, PDMS, Parylene, polyimide) that are printed with circuitry; the flexible nature of the organic background materials allowing the electronics created to bend, and the fabrication techniques used to create these devices resembles those used to create integrated circuits and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Flexible electronics were first developed in the 1960s and 1970s, but research interest increased in the mid-2000s. =Neural dust= Neural dust is a term used to refer to millimeter-sized devices operated as wirelessly powered nerve sensors that were proposed in a 2011 paper from the University of California, Berkeley Wireless Research Center, which described both the challenges and outstanding benefits of creating a long lasting wireless BCI. In one proposed model of the neural dust sensor, the transistor model allowed for a method of separating between local field potentials and action potential \\"spikes\\", which would allow for a greatly diversified wealth of data acquirable from the recordings.

There are 26 species in this genus distributed in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North and Central America. They are predators that can reduce mosquito larvae. Dytiscus are large water beetles with a robust, rounded shape and they measure long depending on the exact species involved. The largest, D. latissimus, is among the largest species in the family and its size is only matched by certain Megadytes. The tarsi of the males are modified into suckers which are used to grip the female in mating. Females are usually larger than the males and come in two forms, with grooved (sulcate) or smooth elytra. Males only ever have smooth elytra. The adults of most species can fly. Life history Adult beetles and their larvae are aquatic but the pupae spend their life in the ground. Females lay eggs inside the tissue of aquatic plants such as reeds. The eggs hatch in about three weeks. The larvae (known as \\"water tigers\\") are elongate with a round and flat head and strong mandibles. They are predatory and their mandible have grooves on their inner edge through which they are able to suck the body fluids of their prey. The larvae take air from the surface of the water using hairs at the end of their abdomen. These lead to spiracles into which the air is taken. Once the larvae grow to some size, they move to soil at the edge of water and burrow into a cell and pupate. The adults breathe by going to the surface and upending. They collect air under their elytra and are able to breathe this collected air using spiracles hidden under the elytra. In Dytiscus marginalis and other species the tarsus of the forelegs is modified in males to form a circular sucker. A reduced sucker is also seen in the midleg of the male.Miall, L. C.

The Commission serves as a national clearinghouse and resource of information regarding election administration. It is charged with administering payments to states and developing guidance to meet HAVA requirements, adopting voluntary voting system guidelines, and accrediting voting system test laboratories and certifying voting equipment. It is also charged with developing and maintaining a national mail voter registration form. Responsibilities The EAC is tasked with performing a number of election- related duties including:EAC Divisions, see HAVA Sections 202, 205 through 209, 221 through 222, 231, 241-247, 801 through 804, and 902 and at NVRA Section 9 * creating and maintaining the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines * creating a national program for the testing, certification, and decertification of voting systems * maintaining the National Mail Voter Registration Form required by the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) * reporting to Congress every two years on the effects of the NVRA on elections * administering federal funds to States for HAVA requirements * administering federal funds for the development of innovative election technology, including pilot programs to test election technology * studying and reporting best practices of effective administration * communicating information on laws, technologies, procedures, studies, and data related to the administration of federal elections to those responsible for formulating or implementing election law and procedures, to the media, and to other interested persons The HAVA requires the EAC will create voluntary guidelines for voting systems, maintaining a clearinghouse of information regarding election administration procedures including testing and certification of election equipment, and administering the Election Assistance and Help America Vote Programs. History In 2003, Congress appropriated US$1.5 billion for HAVA. The General Services Administration distributed most of the $650 million permitted under Title I of HAVA, and the remainder was earmarked for the EAC to disburse. The funds were not distributed because the commissioners were not confirmed until December 9, 2003; the law had required that they be in place by February 26, 2003. The initial Commissioners were: * DeForest Soaries, Jr. (2003‚Äì2005) * Ray Martinez, III (2003‚Äì2006) * Paul S. DeGregorio (2003‚Äì2007) * Gracia Hillman (2003‚Äì2010). In its 2004 budget, Congress again allocated $1.5 billion to fund HAVA. By January 2004, the EAC did not have permanent offices or budget, even though it was required to publish state election reform plans in the Federal Register before money for new voting equipment could be disbursed to the states. On December 6, 2006 Caroline Hunter and Rosemary E. Rodriguez were nominated by President George W. Bush to replace Ray Martinez and Paul DeGregorio.Nominations and Withdrawals Sent to the Senate, Office of the Press Secretary, White House, (December 2006) They were confirmed by the U.S. Senate on February 15, 2007. In 2010, the EAC lost its quorum of Commissioners, after the resignation or end of term of Hunter (2008), Rodriguez (2009) and Hillman (2010), preventing many normal operational duties; and was without any Commissioners by 2011 after the resignation of Davidson. Bills were subsequently drafted to end the Commission. Specifically, Representative Gregg Harper introduced a bill to windup the EAC and transfer some of its functions to the Federal Election Commission. The EAC did not regain a quorum until December 16, 2014, when the U.S. Senate confirmed three Commissioners, Thomas Hicks, Matthew V. Masterson, and Christy McCormick. Masterson resigned in 2018; and on January 2, 2019, President Donald Trump's nominees, Benjamin Hovland and Donald Palmer, were confirmed by the US Senate,Commissioner Donald Palmer and took office in February 2019. Chair and commissioners The Help America Vote Act specifies that four commissioners are nominated by the President on recommendations from the majority and minority leadership in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate. Once confirmed by the full Senate, commissioners may serve two consecutive terms and no more than two commissioners may belong to the same political party. =Commissioners= On December 16, 2014, the U.S. Senate confirmed three Commissioners, Thomas Hicks, Matthew V. Masterson, and Christy A. McCormick. Masterson resigned in 2018. Thomas Hicks served as the Senior Elections Counsel and Minority Elections Counsel on the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on House Administration from 2003 to 2014, where he oversaw all Committee matters relating to Federal elections and campaign finance. Prior to that, he was a Policy Analyst for Common Cause, a non-profit, public advocacy organization working in support of election and campaign finance reform. He also previously served as a Special Assistant in the Office of Congressional Relations at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. He received his J.D. from the Catholic University of America, Columbus School of Law and his B.A. in Government from Clark University (Worcester, MA). Christy A. McCormick served as a Senior Trial Attorney in the Voting Section of the Civil Rights Division at the U.S. Department of Justice, a position she held from 2006 until this year. She was detailed by the Deputy Attorney General to be Senior Attorney Advisor and Acting Deputy Rule of Law Coordinator in the Office of the Rule of Law Coordinator at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq from 2009 to 2010. From 2003 to 2006, she served as a Judicial Clerk to the Honorable Elizabeth A. McClanahan in the Court of Appeals of Virginia. She was an Assistant Attorney General and Assistant to the Solicitor General in the Office of the Attorney General of Virginia from 2001 to 2003. She was a Judicial Law Clerk in the Seventh Judicial Circuit Court of Virginia from 1999 to 2001. She received a B.A. from the University of Buffalo and a J.D. from the George Mason University School of Law.

Newby was appointed in 2015, but soon attracted controversy after agreeing to some states‚Äô requests to require proof of citizenship with voter registration. https://shawneemissionpost.com/2019/12/19/former-joco-election-commissioner- brian-newby-takes-post-in-north-dakota-85232/ In June 2019, Politico reported that Newby lost the trust of some EAC employees and presided over a staff exodus after he \\"blocked important work on election security, micromanaged employees‚Äô interactions with partners outside the agency and routinely ignored staff questions\\". The chairwoman of the EAC, Christy McCormick, a Republican, defended and regularly lauded Newby, while also arguing that the EAC cannot search for a replacement for Newby before he leaves the post in November 2019, at the end of his term. Newby was not reappointed in October 2019 after a 2-2 Commissioner vote split by party lines. =General Counsel= The current General Counsel is Kevin Rayburn. The previous General Counsel was Clifford Tatum, who served a four-year term (October 2015 to October 2019). The agency's first General Counsel, serving under the Executive Director, was Juliet E. Thompson.EAC taps Juliet Thompson for General Counsel Position , August 26, 2004 She previously held the position of Associate General Counsel at the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America, and General Counsel of the Louisiana Department of Elections and Registration. =Inspector General= The current Inspector General is Patricia Layfield. The Office of the Inspector General is tasked with detecting and preventing fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement of EAC programs, regularly performing audits and evaluations. Standards Board The EAC Standards Board was established under title II section 211 of HAVA. Its duties include reviewing the voluntary voting systems guidelines and review of the best practices recommendations. The Board consists of 110 members, 55 State election officials and 55 local election officials. The Board adopts resolutions and makes recommendations by simple majority vote.(see a full list of Standards Board members) The Executive Board includes 9 members: Mark Goins, Chair, Coordinator of Elections, Tennessee Division of Elections; Edgardo Cortes, Vice-Chair, Commissioner Virginia Department of Elections; J. Bradley King, Secretary, Co- Director Indiana Division of Elections; Paul Lux, Supervisor of Elections Okaloosa County, Florida; Gary Poser, Director of Elections Minnesota Secretary of Jerry Schwarting, Auditor Mellette County, South Dakota; Reynaldo Valenzuela, Jr., Assistant Director of Elections Maricopa County, Arizona; Genevieve Whitaker, Deputy Supervisor of Elections (Election System of the Virgin Islands) U.S. Virgin Islands, Sally Williams, Director, Election Liaison Division Michigan Bureau of Elections https://web.archive.org/web/20161223233620/https://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Documents/SB%20Executive%20Board%20Roster%204-29-16-final.pdf Board of Advisors The EAC Board of Advisors was established under title II section 211 of HAVA. Like those of the Standards Board, the Board of Advisors' duties include reviewing the voluntary voting systems guidelines and review of the best practices recommendations. The Board consists of appointed members. Two members being appointed by each of the National Governors Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the National Association of Secretaries of State, the National Association of State Election Directors, the National Association of Counties, the National Association of County Recorders, Election Officials, and Clerks (NACRC), the United States Conference of Mayors, the Election Center, the International Association of County Recorders, Election Officials, and Treasurers (IACREOT), the United States Commission on Civil Rights, and the Architectural and Transportation Barrier Compliance Board. The Board also includes the chief of the Office of Public Integrity of the Department of Justice, the Chief of the Voting Section of the Civil Rights Division at the U.S. Department of Justice, and the director of the Federal Voting Assistance Program of the Department of Defense. Further, the Board also includes four members representing professionals in the field of science and technology, one appointed by the Speaker and one by the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, one appointed by the Majority Leader and one by the Minority Leader of the Senate. Of the eight final members of the Board, four members are appointed by the United States House Committee on House Administration and four members are appointed by the United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. (see a full list of Advisory Board members) Technical Guidelines Development Committee The Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC) is tasked with assisting the EAC in drafting the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines. The Committee membership consists of the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); 14 members appointed jointly by the EAC and the Director of NIST from the Standards Board, the Board of Advisors, the Architectural and Transportation Barrier, and the Access Board, a representative of American National Standards Institute (ANSI), a representative of the IEEE, two representatives of the NASED, and other individuals with technical and scientific expertise relating to voting systems and voting equipment. (see a full list of TGDC members) Criticisms Critics have contended that the EAC has responded positively to political pressure from the Republican Party and the Department of Justice Unsubstantiated claim.. For example, the EAC is said to have overstated the problem of voter fraud, which is often cited by Republicans as a justification for restrictive measures that Democrats charge are intended to prevent qualified Democrats from voting Unsubstantiated claim.. The EAC Chair denied that there was any political pressure. Tova Wang, a consultant to the Commission, wrote a detailed account in The Washington Post about how her research and that of her Republican co-author had been disregarded or altered, to produce a published report \\"that completely stood our own work on its head.\\" The changes included playing up the voter fraud issue and omitting references to charges of voter intimidation lodged by Democrats, as well as removing all criticisms of the Department of Justice. In 2009, the United States Office of Special Counsel issued a report that found that the EAC engaged in political discrimination in federal hiring against an attorney to fill the General Counsel position because he was a Republican. The report was in response to a settlement between the attorney and the EAC, in which the attorney was paid an unspecified amount of money. In 2019, an article in Politico reported that the EAC's Executive Director, Brian Newby, had been the subject of extensive criticism from within and without the agency since his hiring in 2015, culminating in multiple calls for his resignation from members of Congress and the Senate. Anonymous sources reported that Newby played a large role in many EAC staffers leaving, including the departure of Ryan Macias, the acting director of election testing and certification, as well as his predecessor, Brian Hancock. These departures ‚Äúknocked the wind out of the technical sails of the EAC,‚Äù said an anonymous voting security researcher. Exacerbating the situation was the reporter's speculation of the partisan nature of Newby's hiring, with the article labeling him a Republican and the Commissioner who recommended his being hired, Christy McCormick, as well. In February 2016, Newby approved requests from three states to change state-specific instructions on the NVRA federal form related to proof of citizenship for voter registration. These states required proof of citizenship by state law, a controversial policy being pushed by conservative GOP members like Kris Kobach of Kansas, that would be used in support of Donald Trump's widely discredited claim that millions of illegal votes had been cast in the 2016 presidential election and had denied Trump the popular vote. An injunction was placed on the changes by a US Appeals court, although the case remains with the US District Court..

It is the flagship publication of Cox Enterprises. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution is the result of the merger between The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution. The two staffs were combined in 1982. Separate publication of the morning Constitution and afternoon Journal ended in 2001 in favor of a single morning paper under the Journal-Constitution name. The AJC has its headquarters in the Atlanta suburb of Dunwoody, Georgia. It was formerly co-owned with television flagship WSB-TV and six radio stations, which are located separately in midtown Atlanta, however, the AJC remained part of Cox Enterprises, while WSB became part of an independent Cox Media Group. Past issues of the newspaper are archived in the United States Library of Congress. The Atlanta Journal The Atlanta Journal was established in 1883. Founder E.F. Hoge sold the paper to Atlanta lawyer Hoke Smith in 1887. After the Journal supported Presidential candidate Grover Cleveland in the 1892 election, Smith was named as Secretary of the Interior by the victorious Cleveland. Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Margaret Mitchell worked for the Journal from 1922 to 1926. Important for the development of her 1936 Gone With the Wind were the series of profiles of prominent Georgia Civil War generals she wrote for The Atlanta Journal's Sunday magazine, the research for which, scholars believe, led her to her work on the novel. In 1922, the Journal founded one of the first radio broadcasting stations in the South, WSB. The radio station and the newspaper were sold in 1939 to James Middleton Cox, founder of what would become Cox Enterprises. The Journal carried the motto \\"Covers Dixie like the Dew\\". The Atlanta Constitution Constitution building 1890 Atlanta Constitution Building, in abandoned state (1995, Historic American Buildings Survey image.) In 1868, Carey Wentworth Styles, along with his joint venture partners James Anderson and (future Atlanta mayor) William Hemphill purchased a small newspaper, the Atlanta Daily Opinion which they renamed.The Constitution, as it was originally known, was first published on June 16, 1868. Its name changed to The Atlanta Constitution in October 1869. Hemphill became the business manager, a position that he retained until 1901. When Styles was unable to liquidate his holdings in an Albany newspaper, he could not pay for his purchase of the Constitution. He was forced to surrender his interest in the paper to Anderson and Hemphill, who then each owned one half. In 1870 Anderson sold his one half interest in the paper to Col. E. Y. Clarke. In active competition with other Atlanta newspapers, Hemphill hired special trains (one engine and car) to deliver newspapers to the Macon marketplace. The newspaper became such a force that by 1871 it had overwhelmed the Daily Intelligencer, the only Atlanta paper to survive the American Civil War. In August 1875 its name changed to The Atlanta Daily Constitution for two weeks, then to The Constitution again for about a year. In 1876 Captain Evan Howell (a former Intelligencer city editor) purchased the 50 percent interest in the paper from E.Y. Clarke, and became its editor-in-chief. That same year, Joel Chandler Harris began writing for the paper. He soon created the character of Uncle Remus, a black storyteller, as a way of recounting stories from African- American culture. The Howell family would eventually own full interest in the paper from 1902 until 1950. Charlotte Perkins Gilman (pictured) wrote these articles about feminism for the Atlanta Constitution, published on December 10, 1916. In October 1876 the newspaper was renamed as The Daily Constitution, before settling on the name The Atlanta Constitution in September 1881. During the 1880s, editor Henry W. Grady was a spokesman for the \\"New South\\", encouraging industrial development as well as the founding of Georgia Tech in Atlanta. Evan Howell's family would come to own The Atlanta Constitution from 1902 to 1950. The Constitution established one of the first radio broadcasting stations, WGM, which began operating on March 17, 1922, two days after the debut of the Journal's WSB. However, WGM ceased operations after just over a year. Its equipment was donated to what was then known as Georgia School of Technology, which used it to help launch WBBF (later WGST, now WGKA AM 920) in January 1924.\\"Tech Sends First Message To Radio Fans of America\\" by Parks Rusk, Atlanta Constitution, January 15, 1924, page 1. 1948 advertisement for the Constitution's AM radio station WCON. In late 1947, the Constitution established radio station WCON (AM 550).\\"WCON, 7th Atlanta AM Outlet, To Encourage Local Talent\\" The Billboard, October 25, 1947, page 10. Subsequently, it received approval to begin operating an FM station, WCON-FM 98.5 mHz, and a TV station, WCON-TV, on channel 2. But the 1950 merger with the Journal required major adjustments. Contemporary Federal Communications Commission \\"duopoly\\" regulations disallowed owning more than one AM, FM or TV station in a given market, and the Atlanta Journal already owned WSB AM 750 and WSB-FM 104.5, as well as WSB-TV on channel 8. In order to comply with the duopoly restrictions, WCON and the original WSB-FM were shut down.\\"FCC Roundup: Deletions\\", Broadcasting, 3 July 1950, page 76. The WCON-TV construction permit was canceled, and WSB-TV was allowed to move from channel 8 to channel 2.\\"Atlanta Merger\\", Broadcasting, 10 April 1950, p. 50. In addition, in order to standardize with its sister stations, WCON-FM's call letters were changed to WSB-FM. Ralph McGill, editor for the Constitution in the 1940s, was one of the few southern newspaper editors to support the American Civil Rights Movement. Other noteworthy editors of The Atlanta Constitution include J. Reginald Murphy. \\"Reg\\" Murphy gained notoriety after being kidnapped in 1974. Murphy later moved to the West Coast and served as editor of the San Francisco Examiner. Celestine Sibley was an award-winning reporter, editor, and beloved columnist for the Constitution from 1941 to 1999, and also wrote 25 fiction and nonfiction books about Southern life. After her death, the Georgia House of Representatives named its press gallery in her honor as a mark of affection and respect. From the 1970s until his death in 1994, Lewis Grizzard was a popular humor columnist for the Constitution. He portrayed Southern \\"redneck\\" culture with a mixture of ridicule and respect. The Constitution won numerous Pulitzer Prizes. In 1931 it won a Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for exposing corruption at the local level. In 1959, The Constitution won a Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing for Ralph McGill's editorial \\"A Church, A School...\\" In 1967 it was awarded another Pulitzer Prize for Eugene Patterson's editorials. (Patterson later left his post as editor over a dispute over an op-ed piece.) In 1960, Jack Nelson won the Pulitzer Prize for local reporting, by exposing abuses at Milledgeville State Hospital for the mentally ill. Even after newsrooms were combined in 1982, the papers were published in independent editions. In 1988 the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning went to the Constitution's Doug Marlette. Editorial cartoonist Mike Luckovich received Pulitzer Prizes in 1995 and 2006. Cynthia Tucker received a 2007 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary. Merger Cox Enterprises bought the Constitution in June 1950, bringing both newspapers under one ownership and combining sales and administrative offices. Separate newsrooms were kept until 1982. Both newspapers continued to be published for another two decades, with much of the same content except for timely editing. The Journal, an afternoon paper, led the morning Constitution until the 1970s, when afternoon papers began to fall out of favor with subscribers. In November 2001, the two papers, which were once fierce competitors, merged to produce one daily morning paper, The Atlanta Journal- Constitution. The two papers had published a combined edition on weekends and holidays for years previously. Prior to the merger, both papers planned to start TV stations: WSB-TV on channel 8 for the Journal, and WCON-TV on channel 2 for the Constitution. Only WSB got on the air, beginning in 1948 as the first TV station in the Deep South. It moved from channel 8 to WCON's allotment on channel 2 in 1951 to avoid TV interference from the nearby channel 9. (WROM-TV since moved, leaving WGTV on 8, after it was also used by WLWA-TV, now WXIA-TV 11.) This was also necessary to satisfy Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules preventing the excessive concentration of media ownership, preventing the combined paper from running two stations. In 1989, Bill Dedman received the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting for The Color of Money, his expos√© on racial discrimination in mortgage lending, or redlining, by Atlanta banks. The newspapers' editor, Bill Kovach, had resigned in November 1988 after the stories on banks and others had ruffled feathers in Atlanta and among corporate leadership, some of whom complained of a \\"take-no-prisoners\\" editorial approach. In 1993, Mike Toner received the Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting for When Bugs Fight Back, his series about organisms and their resistance to antibiotics and pesticides. Julia Wallace was named the first female editor of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2002. She was named Editor of the Year 2004 by Editor & Publisher magazine. Mike Luckovich won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial cartooning a second time in 2006. He had first received it in 1995 under The Atlanta Constitution banner. Circulation The paper used to cover all 159 counties in Georgia, and the bordering counties of western North Carolina, where many Atlantans vacation or have second homes. In addition it had some circulation in other bordering communities, such as Tallahassee, Florida, where the Sunday AJC was available. Due to the downturn in the newspaper industry and competing media sources, the AJC contracted distribution dramatically in the late 2000s to serve only the metro area. From Q1 of 2007 to Q1 of 2010, daily circulation plunged over 44%. Headquarters The AJC has its headquarters in Perimeter Center, an office district of Dunwoody, Georgia. Previously the AJC headquarters were in Downtown Atlanta near the Five Points district. In August 2009, the AJC occupied less than 30 percent of its downtown building, which had become outdated and costly to maintain. Later that year, the AJC consolidated its printing operations by transferring the downtown production center to the Gwinnett County facility. In 2010 the newspaper relocated its headquarters to leased offices in Dunwoody, a northern suburb of Atlanta. In November 2010, the company donated its former downtown headquarters to the city of Atlanta, which plans to convert the building into a fire and police training academy.  Parts  The AJC has four major sections daily. On Sundays, it has additional sections. The main section usually consists of Georgia news, national news, international news, and business news. The Metro section includes major headlines from the Metro Atlanta area. The Metro section usually reports the weather forecast. The Sports section reports sports-related news. Before social media became popular, the Metro and Sports sections contained \\"The Vent\\" features, where readers expressed opinions about current events.Robin M. Kowalski, Aversive Interpersonal Behaviors, 2013, p. 99 1475793545 Quote: \\"The Atlanta Constitution, for instance, has a column entitled \\"The Vent\\" that contains people's complaints.\\" The Living section contains articles, recipes, reviews, movie times, and puzzles including Sudoku, crossword puzzle, and word scramble; plus a full page of color comics daily. Comics are printed in a separate section in Sunday editions.

United Kingdom implementation of the EU directive. Section . Such rights are often referred to in the plural: database rights. The TRIPS Agreement requires that copyright protection extends to databases and other compilations if they constitute intellectual creation by virtue of the selection or arrangement of their contents, even if some or all of the contents do not themselves constitute materials protected by copyright.Article 10.5, TRIPS Agreement. See WTO Overview of TRIPS Agreement Many countries act in accordance with this requirement, as databases are protected by copyright if this condition is met, and there is no separate intellectual property right protecting databases (or any aspects of them) that do not meet the condition for copyright protection. The database right extends protection over databases which does not depend on the condition required for copyright protection, and is recognised only in a small number of jurisdictions, most notably the European Union. Countries that recognise database rights=European Union= In European Union law, database rights are specifically coded (i.e. sui generis) laws on the copying and dissemination of information in computer databases. These rights were first introduced in 1996. On 11 March 1996 the Council of the European Union passed Directive 96/9/EC of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, giving specific and separate legal rights (and limitations) to certain computer records. The law calls these database rights. Rights afforded to manual records under EU database rights laws are similar in format, but not identical, to those afforded artistic works. Database rights last for 15 years. Each time a database is substantially modified, however, a new set of rights are created for that database. An owner has the right to object to the copying of substantial parts of their database, even if data is extracted and reconstructed piecemeal. Database rights under the EU are created automatically, vested in the employers of creators (when the action of creation was part of employment), and do not have to be registered to have effect. Database rights are independent of copyright: The arrangement, selection, and presentation of the data may be protected by copyright, while the database as a whole can be protected by database right.Directive 96/9/EC, Article 7, paragraph 4 =United Kingdom= On 1 January 1998, The Copyright and Rights in Databases Regulations 1997 came into force. These regulations made a number of amendments to the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 with respect to databases, a database being defined as :\\"a collection of independent works, data or other materials which - ::(a) are arranged in a systematic or methodical way, and ::(b) are individually accessible by electronic or other means\\" The regulations extend existing copyright law to databases, to the extent that they constitute \\"the author's own intellectual creation\\". In addition, regulations 13 and 14 create a database right. Database rights automatically subsist if there has been a \\"substantial investment in obtaining, verifying or presenting the contents\\" of the database. Such rights remain in force under regulation 17(2) until the end of the 15th calendar year from the date on which the database was first made available to the public. During that period, database right will be infringed by any person who, without consent, \\"extracts or re-uses all or a substantial part of the contents of the database\\", whether all at once or by repeated extractions of \\"insubstantial\\" parts. On the other hand, any lawful user of the database has a right under regulation 19(1) \\"to extract or re-use insubstantial parts of the data for any purpose\\", and that right cannot be restricted by the database owner (regulation 19(2)). The term \\"substantial\\" is defined to mean \\"substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a combination of both\\". =Russia= In article 1260 of the Civil Code of Russia, a database is a collection of independent materials presented in an objective form (articles, accounts, legal texts, judicial decisions, and other similar materials), which are systematically arranged in a way that these materials can be found and processed by a computer. A database need not be registered to enjoy legal protection, but the Civil Code of Russia provides for the registration of rights, which is useful if the claims are disputed in court. Russia generally follows the EU model, there are some differences. Countries that do not recognise database rights=Australia= No specific law exists in Australia protecting databases. Databases may only be protected if they fall under general copyright law. Australian copyright law regarding compilations is currently examined in case law, where an initial case, Telstra v Desktop Marketing Systems was successfully litigated by Telstra, establishing a database right; however this was overturned in a later ruling, IceTV v Nine Network, where sufficient creativity was established as the defining characteristic of copyright. =United States= Uncreative collections of facts are outside of Congressional authority under the Copyright Clause (Article I, ¬ß 8, cl. 8) of the United States Constitution, therefore no database right exists in the United States. Originality is the sine qua non of copyright in the United States (see Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service). This has not stopped database owners lobbying for the introduction of such a right, but so far bills to introduce it in the US have been prevented by the successful lobbying of research libraries, consumer groups and firms who benefit from the free use of factual information. Other countries=Brazil= In Brazil, Federal Law No. 9610 of 1998 (the Law of the authorial rights) confers database owners exclusive rights specifically for copying, distribution and translation of databases. The same law also states that this right is contingent upon the database being the result of an intellectual creation, which may be deemed so based on \\"the selection, organization, or disposition of its content\\". Therefore, legislation in Brazil may or may not offer database rights, depending on how the database was developed.

During the Second World War some were used by the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a transport and general communications duties. Design and development The Flamingo was a twin- engined civil airliner designed by de Havilland, led by their chief designer R. E. Bishop, and was the first all-metal stressed-skin aircraft built by de Havilland; only the control surfaces were fabric covered. It was powered by two 890 hp Bristol Perseus XIIIC air-cooled radial engines driving three- bladed D.H hydromatic variable-pitch propellers. Two pilots were seated side by side with a radio operator behind them in the cockpit, with the cabin accommodating 12‚Äì17 passengers. It had a retractable undercarriage, slotted flaps, and was considered a highly promising sales prospect for the company, capable of competing with the American Douglas DC-3 and Lockheed Model 10 Electra. The first prototype flew on 22 December 1938.Jackson 1987, p. 399. Powered by 890 hp (660 kW) Bristol Perseus engines, it had a maximum weight takeoff in 750 ft (230 m) and the ability to maintain height or climb at 120 mph (190 km/h) on a single engine. Testing was successful, with the Flamingo being granted a certificate of airworthiness on 30 June 1939,Green and Swanborough 1986, p. 4. with an initial production run of twenty aircraft being laid down.Green and Swanborough 1986, p. 5. The Hertfordshire, the transport variant of the Flamingo. This was the only one built, which fatally crashed in October 1940 A single military transport variant was built to Specification 19/39 as the DH.95 Hertfordshire. It had oval cabin windows instead of rectangular ones, and seating for 22 soldiers. A proposed order for 40 was cancelled to leave de Havillands free to produce Tiger Moth trainers. The sole Hertfordshire crashed with the loss of 11 lives at Mill Hill, Hertfordshire on 23 October 1940, apparently due to jamming of the elevator. Operational service DH.95 Flamingo G-AFYH of British Air Transport at Redhill airfield, Surrey, in June 1953 Following the success of the first test flights Jersey Airways ordered three 17-seat aircraft, and this was followed by orders from the Egyptian government and the Air Ministry. The Air Ministry aircraft were to be used by the Air Council and the King's Flight. The prototype, fitted with 12 passenger seats, was delivered to Jersey Airways in May 1939 for two months evaluation and became the first revenue-earning Flamingo. The first services carried mail only but in July a regular weekend passenger service was operated. In October 1939 the prototype was bought by the Air Council, being delivered to No. 24 Squadron RAF where it operated until it was lost in an accident in October 1940. The second aircraft was to be the first for Guernsey and Jersey Airlines but it was impressed into military service and delivered to 24 Squadron, the other two on order were never built due to the outbreak of the Second World War. The King's Flight aircraft was to be used in the event of the royal family having to leave the country but in the end it was passed to 24 Squadron for communications and liaison duties. Early in 1940 BOAC ordered eight aircraft to be powered by the Perseus XVI and originally intended as ten-seaters. The first BOAC aircraft was delivered to Whitchurch on 5 September 1940. The second BOAC aircraft was impressed by the Air Ministry and allocated for Admiralty use at RNAS Donibristle. To replace the impressed aircraft BOAC were later allotted the aircraft ordered by the Egyptian Government. After a period of training all the BOAC Flamingos were moved to Cairo to operate in the Middle East. The BOAC aircraft were named after English Kings and were named K-class by the airline. The Flamingo was Winston Churchill's favorite short/medium range transport and he flew it to visit Reynaud and the French leadership as the front collapsed on May 16, 1940 The BOAC Flamingoes were not popular, and following three accidents ‚Äì one of which was fatal ‚Äì and with a lack of spares, the airline decided to withdraw the type. In 1943 the five airworthy aircraft were shipped back to the United Kingdom. They did not return to service and were scrapped in the early 1950s. Most of the RAF aircraft were withdrawn from use during the war and were slowly scrapped to provide spares for the remaining aircraft. The Admiralty aircraft was due to be withdrawn and scrapped but in August 1944 it ground looped at Gatwick and was abandoned. In 1946 the former Admiralty aircraft was bought by Southern Aircraft (Gatwick) and rebuilt using former BOAC spare parts. It flew again in 1947 and was delivered to British Air Transport at Redhill, gaining a Certificate of Airworthiness. It operated a number of charter flight until it was temporarily withdrawn from use in 1949. British Air Transport also arranged to restore three former BOAC aircraft, the scheme was abandoned although the aircraft were in an advanced stage of reconstruction. In 1952, British Air Transport restored the original former Admiralty aircraft which flew again on 27 May 1952. Redhill Aerodrome was closed in 1954 and the last flying Flamingo was dismantled and scrapped.

History Dumbleyung's name is of Noongar origin, coming from \\"Dambeling\\" which possibly means \\"large lake or inland sea\\" (although another source suggests it came from \\"dumbung\\", a game played with bent sticks and a hard piece of fruit. The lake nearby was discovered and named Dambeling Lake by explorers Henry Landor and Henry Maxwell Lefroy in 1843, and the current spelling was used by surveyors in the 1860s and 1870s. Pastoralists and sandalwood cutters moved into the area, initially settling at Nippering, north of Lake Dumbleyung and west of the present town. The first three families to settle in the area were the Cronin, Kersley and Bartram families. George Kersley, Sr. and his future son-in-law Henry Bartram were from pioneer families of the Beverley district and they used to take their sheep flocks from Beverley to Lake Dumbleyung for grazing. In 1875 Kersley received the first grazing leases and the Cronin family from Cork Ireland settled at \\"Bunkin\\" in 1878. Bartram settled his young family at \\"Wheatfield\\" on the edge of the Lake in 1886. However, in 1907, Dumbleyung was gazetted as a townsite and became the terminus of a railway from Wagin. Tenders were called for the construction of an Agricultural Hall in 1909, and it was completed by 1910. The National Bank temporarily opened its town branch in the hall. By 1915, Dumbleyung had grown to become the major rural service town in the region. Present day The nearby Dumbleyung Lake is a well-known attraction. The lake is famous for Donald Campbell breaking the world water speed record there in 1964 in his boat, Bluebird.

The name of the town effectually means \\"the heights of the views.\\"Conder (1879), p. 116 Identification Ramah, the home of Elkanah, Samuel's father (), the birthplace of Samuel and the seat of his authority (), the town is frequently mentioned in the history of that prophet and of David (). Here Samuel died and was buried (). The historian Josephus distinguishes between Ramathaim, \\"a city of the tribe of Ephraim,\\"Josephus, Antiquities 5.10.2. (5.341) and Ramah, the burial place of Samuel the prophet.Josephus, Antiquities 6.13.5. (6.292) Ramathaim-Zophim has been tentatively identified with one of two sites. One of them is the modern Palestinian village of Nabi Samwil, the other the former village, now town, of er-Ram. =Er-Ram as Ramah= Ramah, according to Eusebius' Onomasticon, was located 6 milestones north of Jerusalem (Ailia), opposite Bethel. Accordingly, Ramah is now thought by many historical geographers to be Er Ram, about 8 km north of Jerusalem.Ministry of Tourism, Government of Israel, Er Ram (Ramah), accessed 25 November 2016 The Survey of Western Palestine identifies er-Ram with Ramah of Benjamin from ., p. 13, s.v. Er Ram. =Nabi Samwil as Ramah= Nabi Samwil stands about 5 miles north-west of Jerusalem, and is held by an originally Christian tradition dating back to the Byzantine period to be the resting place of the prophet Samuel). The site comprises what is now the Israeli Nebi Samuel National Park, with its most prominent feature being a two-storey Crusader fortress, now used as a mosque and a Jewish Orthodox synagogue. Benjamin of Tudela visited Nabi Samwil when he travelled the land in 1173, noting that the Crusaders had found the bones of Samuel in a Jewish cemetery in Ramla on the coastal plain and reburied them here, on the hill overlooking the Holy City. C.R. Conder, of the Palestine Exploration Fund, discredits this tradition. =Ramallah as Ramathaim- Zophim= C.R. Conder of the Palestine Exploration Fund raised the hypothesis that, because of its high elevation and how that it affords a good prospect of the surrounding region, Ramathaim-Zophim may have been Ramallah. =Nabi Samwil as Mizpah= The traditional tomb site of Samuel the prophet, which became known as Neby Samwil (\\"the prophet Samuel\\"), may have been Mizpah in Benjamin, where Samuel was appointed leader of the Israelites (). Such was the view of Edward Robinson who visited the site in 1838, and who vehemently objected to identifying Neby Samwil with the Ramah of Samuel. Conder and Kitchener of the Palestine Exploration Fund described the site in their days as being \\"a small hamlet of mud hovels.\\", p. 12, s.v. Neby Samwil. Judas Machabeus, preparing for war with the Syrians, gathered his men at Mizpah, over against Jerusalem: for in Mizpah was a place of prayer heretofore in Israel.I Mach., iii, 46, cited in =Arimathea= Some, e.g. Petrus Comestor (ca. 1100-1179) in his Historia Scholastica, Cap.

E. van Vogt. An example of space opera subgenre, the novel is a \\"fix-up\\" compilation of four previously published stories: *\\"Black Destroyer\\" (cover story of the July, 1939, issue of Astounding magazine‚Äîthe first published SF by A. E. van Vogt) (chapters 1 to 6) *\\"War of Nerves\\" (May, 1950, Other Worlds magazine) (chapters 9 to 12) *\\"Discord in Scarlet\\" (cover story of the December, 1939, issue of Astounding magazine‚Äîthe second published SF by A. E. van Vogt) (chapters 13 to 21) *\\"M33 in Andromeda\\" (August, 1943, Astounding magazine, later published as a story in the book M33 in Andromeda (1971)) (chapters 22 to 28) The book was republished in 1952 under the title Mission: Interplanetary. A huge globular spaceship, manned by a chemically castrated all-male crew of nearly a thousand, who are on an extended scientific mission to explore intergalactic space, encounters several, mostly hostile, aliens and alien civilizations. On board the spaceship during its journey, both political and scientific revolutions take place. The title of the book is a reference to The Voyage of the Beagle, Charles Darwin's book about his five-year voyage around the world on . Plot summary The main protagonist of the novel is Dr. Elliott Grosvenor, the only Nexialist on board (a new discipline depicted as taking an actively generalist approach towards science). It is Grosvenor's training and application of Nexialism rather than the more narrow-minded approaches of the individual scientific and military minds of his other shipmates that consistently prove more effective against the hostile encounters both from outside and within the Space Beagle. He is eventually forced to take control of the ship using a combination of hypnotism, psychology, brainwashing, and persuasion, in order to develop an effective strategy for defeating the alien entity Anabis and saving the ship and our galaxy. The book can be roughly divided into four sections corresponding to the four short stories on which it was based: In the first section, the Space Beagle lands on a largely deserted desolate planet. Small scattered herds of deer-like creatures are seen, and the ancient ruins of cities litter the landscape. Coeurl, a starving, intelligent and vicious cat- like carnivore with tentacles on its shoulders, approaches the ship, pretending to be an unintelligent animal, and quickly infiltrates it. The creature kills several crewmen before being tricked into leaving the now spaceborne ship in a lifeboat. It then commits suicide when it realizes it has been defeated. In the second part, the ship is almost destroyed by internal warfare caused by telepathic contact with a race of bird-like aliens, called Riim. The benign signals that the Riim send are incompatible with the human mind. Only Grosvenor's knowledge of telepathic phenomena saves the ship from destruction. In the third section, the ship comes across Ixtl, a scarlet being floating in deep space. It is a vicious survivor of a race that ruled a previous universe before the Big Bang, the creation of our own universe. Ixtl boards the ship, and being obsessed with its own reproduction, kidnaps several crew members in order to implant parasitic eggs in their stomachs. It is eventually tricked into leaving the ship, after all the crew have left the ship temporarily, leaving no prey left for its offspring to feed on. In the last section, Anabis, a galaxy-spanning consciousness, is encountered. Once again, it is both malevolent, starving and aggressive, and under all circumstances must be prevented from following the ship back to any other galaxy. Anabis, which is essentially a galaxy-size will-o'-the-wisp, feeds off the death of living organisms, and has destroyed all intelligent life in its galaxy. It transforms all planets it can find into jungle planets through terraforming, since it is these kind of worlds that produce most life. The crew of the Space Beagle lures the intelligence to chase the ship into deep space, causing it to starve to death. Running concurrently to this, the book also covers a power struggle on the ship among the leaders of individual scientific and military groups. Reception P. Schuyler Miller, while praising the original stories, found that the rewriting needed to stitch them into an original novel was inadequate, so that \\"the whole is less than its original parts.\\" The novel was reprinted in 2008. The critic Joe Milicia took the opportunity of this re-issue to revisit the novel in a comprehensive review for the New York Review of Science Fiction. Milicia looks at what today‚Äôs reader might find in the novel, noting: Among the surprises identified by Milicia that it may hold for the modern reader are the disharmony aboard the Space Beagle (‚ÄúClearly, Machiavelli rather than Darwin is the true spirit guiding the Space Beagle‚Äù), and that the Space Beagle‚Äôs mission is like the original Beagles and very unlike the USS Enterprises.Milicia (2010), page 6 References in other works A sentient panther-like species named Coeurl (or Zorl in French editions), with psi capabilities and tentacles coming out of its shoulders, was adapted as the character Mughi (or Mugi) in the anime Dirty Pair. It also appears in several versions of the Final Fantasy video games, and as the Displacer beast in the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. The Coeurl suck phosphorus (\\"id\\") from their victims; the \\"salt vampire\\" in the Star Trek episode \\"The Man Trap\\" removes sodium. At first glance, the alien Ixtl also appears to be an inspiration for the film Alien, though those involved with the film denied any influence on its part. A lawsuit Van Vogt initiated against 20th Century Fox for plagiarism was settled out of court, the details of which were never disclosed.BBC - My Science Fiction Life - The Voyage of the Space Beagle The book was translated into several languages and, as was the case for most of van Vogt's work, was very popular in France. In Japan it is noted that Korita, the character who explains the demise of the first monster, is Japanese, and presented without racist slights. Two of the races, the Riim (pp 82‚Äì83) and the Ixtl (pp 52‚Äì53) are depicted in Barlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials. In David Gerrold's Chtorr novel A Season for Slaughter, a robot probe called a \\"prowler\\" is used. The prowler makes a distinctive \\"coeurl\\" sound, described several times as \\"the prowler coeurled on\\". The reference to the Coeurl in the first story of the Voyage of the Space Beagle, where the phrase \\"Coeurl prowled on\\" occurs, is unmistakable. A hologram called a \\"prowler\\" appears as one of the distractions employed by the Enterprise lieutenant Kevin Riley to surprise the deck crew of the \\"Voyager\\" worldship in David Gerrold's The Galactic Whirlpool Star Trek TOS novel. It is a friendly, weirdly-colored, balloon-like hologram that makes a distinctive \\"coeurl\\" sound (\\"Riley stepped up to the illusion and said, 'Command: Prowl! Activate.' 'Coeurl,' said the prowler, nodding to nuzzle Riley wetly, then it turned and lumbered down the corridor. 'Coeurl? Coeurl?' it called as it disappeared into the gloom. On and on the prowler called, until finally it disappeared into the murk of distance. Kirk looked at Riley. 'Good job, Lieutenant. Uh- where is it going now?).

History Kihn was born in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. His early influence was The Beatles and their appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. \\"Just about every rock and roll musician my age can point to one cultural event that inspired him to take up music in the first place: The Beatles on Ed Sullivan. If you were a shy 14-year-old kid who already had a guitar, it was a life-altering event. ... In a single weekend everything had changed. I'd come home from school the previous Friday looking like Dion. I went back to class on Monday morning with my hair dry and brushed forward. That's how quickly it happened.\\" Kihn began his career in his hometown of Baltimore, working in the singer/songwriter mold but switched to straightforward rock & roll when he moved to San Francisco, California, in 1974. He started writing songs and playing coffee houses while still in high school in the Baltimore area. When Kihn was 17, his mother submitted a tape of one of his original songs to the talent contest of the big local Top 40 radio station WCAO, in which he took first prize and won three things that would change his life: a typewriter, a stack of records, and a Vox electric guitar. Following his move to California, Kihn worked at painting houses, singing in the streets, and working behind the counter at the Berkeley record store, Rather Ripped Records, with future bandmate and Earth Quake guitarist Gary Phillips. The following year, he became one of the first artists signed to Matthew King Kaufman's Beserkley Records. Along with Jonathan Richman, Earth Quake, and The Rubinoos, Kihn helped to carve the label's sound‚Äîmelodic pop with a strong 1960s pop sensibility ‚Äî an alternative to the prog rock of the time. In 1976, after his debut on the compilation Beserkley Chartbusters, he recorded his first album with his own ensemble, called The Greg Kihn Band, comprising Robbie Dunbar (guitar), Steve Wright (bass), and Larry Lynch (drums). Dunbar, already a member of Earth Quake, was replaced by Dave Carpender in time to record their second album, Greg Kihn Again. Meanwhile, Kihn's old record store pal, Gary Phillips, who had contributed guitars to Kihn's first album, returned as a session musician on the band's Glass House Rock (1980) album and officially joined the band as keyboardist for the follow-up album, Rockihnroll (1981). The lineup of Kihn, Wright, Lynch, Phillips, and Carpender lasted until 1983, when Greg Douglass replaced Dave Carpender. Through the 1970s, Kihn released an album each year and built a strong cult following through constant touring, becoming Beserkley's biggest seller. In 1981, Kihn earned his first bona-fide hit on The Billboard Hot 100 with the # 15 single, \\"The Breakup Song (They Don't Write 'Em),\\" from the Rockihnroll album. Kihn continued in a more commercial vein through the 1980s with a series of pun-titled albums: Kihntinued (1982), Kihnspiracy (1983), Kihntageous (1984), and Citizen Kihn (1985). Kihn scored his biggest hit with \\"Jeopardy\\" (1983), which reached number 2 in the Billboard Hot 100, from the Kihnspiracy album. In 1983, the groundbreaking \\"Jeopardy\\" video became an MTV favorite. Many of the videos that followed were sequels with connecting story lines. One of the earliest examples of a \\"concept\\" video with its Night of the Living Dead theme, \\"Jeopardy\\" received heavy airplay on the fledgling cable music channel and spawned countless imitators. \\"Jeopardy\\" was spoofed by \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic as \\"I Lost on Jeopardy\\", on Yankovic's album \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic in 3-D (1984); Kihn authorized Yankovic to make the spoof under the condition he could participate; which was seen at the end of Yankovic's music video where Yankovic is tossed into a convertible, revealing Kihn to be the driver. Kihn spent most of the 1980s touring constantly, opening arena-sized shows for groups such as Journey, the Grateful Dead, and the Rolling Stones. Kihn often appeared on TV during this period on shows such as Solid Gold, American Bandstand, and Saturday Night Live. On May 10, 1981, Kihn and Willie Nile appeared live on the King Biscuit Flower Hour from the Savoy Theater, New York City. In 1985, Kihn broke with Beserkley Records and signed with EMI. Matthew Kaufman continued to produce Kihn's albums. \\"Lucky\\" (1985) reached a modest # 30 on the Hot 100 and spawned a splashy video sequel to the popular \\"Jeopardy\\" video. In 1986, Joe Satriani replaced Greg Douglass on lead guitar, Tyler Eng replaced Larry Lynch on drums, and Pat Mosca replaced Gary Phillips on keyboards. This is the lineup that went into the studio to record the album Love and Rock & Roll (1986). From 1996 through 2012, Kihn was a morning radio disc jockey for San Francisco Bay Area classic rock radio station KUFX. Kihn's literary career also began in 1996 with the release of his first novel, Horror Show, published by Tor/Forge Books. Horror Show was nominated for the prestigious Bram Stoker Award for Best First Novel. It was followed by Shade of Pale (1997), Big Rock Beat (1998), and Mojo Hand (1999). Kihn also published many short stories during this period, some appearing in the Hot Blood series of erotic horror fiction. Kihn was contributing editor to Carved in Rock, a compilation of short fiction by musicians including Pete Townshend, Joan Jett, Ray Davies, and Kinky Friedman. The Greg Kihn Band continues to play with a lineup comprising Kihn's son Ry Kihn on lead guitar, Dave Danza (from Eddie Money) on drums, Dave Medd (from the Tubes) on keyboards, and Robert Berry (from Hush) on bass. Kihn was inducted into the San Jose Rock Hall of Fame in 2007. In September 2013, Kihn conducted an interview with Music Life Radio detailing his life, including music, radio, and writing careers. Charity work and volunteerism Kihn has done charity work for ‚ÄúOperation Care and Comfort‚Äù, a military support group responsible for sending care packages to hundreds of military units deployed in harm‚Äôs way around the world. He was nominated for the 2010 ‚ÄúMan of the Year Award‚Äù by the Lymphoma Society and does work for Children‚Äôs Hospital in Oakland, California, in the never ending fight against cancer. Personal life Kihn is managed by original Beserkley partner Joel Turtle, they have remained best friends and business partners since the early 1970s. Discography Greg Kihn and Greg Kihn Band discography Author Kihn has written four horror fiction novels, beginning with Horror Show (1996), which nominated for the Bram Stoker Award for Best First Novel, followed by Shade of Pale (1997). Big Rock Beat and Mojo Hand were subsequently released as sequels to Horror Show.

A member of the Liberal Party, he represented the Montreal riding of Notre-Dame-de-Gr√¢ce and served in the cabinet of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau from 1972 to 1979. As Solicitor General, Allmand introduced legislation that successfully abolished the death penalty in Canada in 1976. After leaving federal politics, Allmand took on the role of human rights activist, and led the International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development and the World Federalist Movement-Canada. He briefly returned to politics by serving a term from 2005‚Äì2009 as a Montreal city councillor under G√©rald Tremblay's Union Montreal party, becoming Vice President of the city council. Allmand died on December 7, 2016 from terminal brain cancer. Early life and career William Warren Allmand was born in Montreal on September 19, 1932, and was raised in the Mile End neighbourhood. He had a Jesuit education at Loyola College in Montreal. He attended St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia, and graduated in 1954 with a bachelor's degree in economics. Allmand studied civil law at McGill University, and graduated in 1957 with a bachelor of civil law degree. During his time at McGill, he was the chairman of the faculty of education in 1956‚Äì57. He was also a member of the university's Newman Club and played three years of varsity ice hockey for the McGill Redmen. After graduation, Allmand was admitted into the Quebec bar in 1958. He also earned certificates in comparative law at the University of Paris and at the Institute of Comparative Law. Federal politics In the 1965 federal election, Allmand ran for the Liberal Party of Canada in the Montreal riding of Notre-Dame-de-Gr√¢ce, and was elected to the Parliament of Canada. He would serve his constituency for over 30 years, being re-elected in every subsequent election before stepping down in 1997. As a backbencher, Allmand was a strong advocate for stronger gun laws in Canada, supporting regulations on all Canadian gun owners and limiting access to all guns, including those for hunting. In 1971, he proposed a bill to only permit government stores to sell guns. The bill also proposed an application process which included a waiting period during which the gun purchase was publicly listed to allow anyone to object. Allmand also proposed requiring gun owners to compile annual reports on their gun use and the condition of the gun, and to return their guns to the government when no longer used. Allmand continued to advocate for gun control laws upon his appointment to cabinet. In 1967, after Charles de Gaulle said \\"Vive le Qu√©bec libre\\" while on a state visit to Canada during Expo 67, Allmand sent a message to Paul Martin Sr., the External Affairs Minister, that the rest of the trip must be cancelled. = Solicitor General = Allmand was sworn into the Privy Council on November 27, 1972 when he succeeded Jean-Pierre Goyer as Solicitor General for Pierre Trudeau, a post he held until September 13, 1976. Serving in the aftermath of the October Crisis, he testified before the Keable commission. In 1976, Allmand signed a warrant requested by Michael Dare, the Director-General of Royal Canadian Mounted Police Security Service, to authorize them to intercept the mail of a Toronto couple. The couple were suspected of conspiring with the Japanese Red Army, possibly to attack the upcoming 1976 Summer Olympics. After the Department of Justice advised Allmand it was a violation of the Post Office Act, it was cancelled in December 1976, nine months after it had been granted. In December 1976, Allmand was Solicitor General when Leonard Peltier was extradited to the United States. According to Allmand, the Federal Bureau of Investigation submitted false information to the Canadian government, including an affidavit from a woman with mental disorders who claimed to be Peltier's girlfriend. In 1977, after Allmand was no longer Solicitor General, he testified before the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Certain Activities of the RCMP (the McDonald Commission) that the RCMP had advised him that it was legal for them to break into buildings to conduct warrantless searches as long as they did not take anything. Allmand would later state that the RCMP had been dishonest in withholding information from him and other solicitors general.  Abolishing the death penalty  After Trudeau's Liberals upgraded their minority government to a majority in the 1974 federal election, they had more leeway to act on abolishing capital punishment. In 1973, Liberals had renewed the provisions of Bill C-168, passed by Lester B. Pearson's minority government in 1968, which imposed a five-year moratorium on the use of the death penalty. With a majority behind them, Allmand and Trudeau, both ardent abolitionists, prepared to go further than Pearson had gone and decided to try and abolish the death penalty altogether. Allmand felt it was hypocritical to have the law on the books when Parliament had commuted every death sentence since 1962. He also felt that it was illegitimate to grant the Cabinet and the judiciary the power over an individual person's ultimate fate, noting that it is not in line with the values held by Canadian society. Because of these views, Canada's official hangman called for his resignation. In 1976 Allmand tabled Bill C-84, An Act to Amend the Criminal Code in Relation to the Punishment for Murder and Certain Other Serious Offences, the bill that would remove the death penalty from the Criminal Code and abolish its use in Canada. A sentence of life imprisonment with no chance of parole for a minimum of 25 years was substituted instead. 119 parliamentarians spoke for or against the bill over the course of the debate, with members of both the Liberal and Progressive Conservative parties divided in their support of the bill. Opponents of the bill cited recent polling that 70% of Canadians supported capital punishment and called on the government to call a national referendum on the issue. Other opponents accused Allmand and Trudeau of proposing the bill now so that it would not expire before the next federal election in 1979 and risk costing the Liberals votes. Almost all opponents thought that the death penalty was a necessary response to terrorism, insurrection, and other serious crimes. Former Progressive Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker argued that after the Munich massacre, passing Bill C-84 was sending the wrong message in the lead-up to the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. In response to the calls for referendum, including a motion for a national plebiscite by Alberta MP Gordon Towers, Allmand argued that the role of MPs was to deliberate in the House of Commons, make up their own minds, and then vote. He also argued that representative democracy necessarily excluded plebiscites, because then it would open the door to plebiscites on a variety of serious and controversial issues. In order not to risk the fall of the government over the bill given its contentious nature, Allmand and Trudeau agreed that the final vote would be a free vote. Despite the Liberal majority in the House of Commons, it only narrowly passed Bill C-84, 131 to 124. A year after the vote, Allmand remarked in a speech delivered to Amnesty International, that \\"Capital punishment, simply because it is immoral and useless, must be fought and defeated if we are to become a world society in which our descendants can live in peace and justice.\\" = Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development = After being Solicitor General, Allmand continued to serve in the cabinet of Pierre Trudeau as Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development from September 14, 1976 to September 15, 1977. While the Minister of Indian Affairs, Allmand was seen as particularly sensitive to the need to use appropriate language and have equitable relations with Indigenous Peoples in Canada. By taking the treaties with Indigenous Peoples at face value and extending the benefit of doubt to the people subject to the treaties, Allmand extended the rule of law to Indigenous witnesses in a largely unprecedented manner. Unlike his predecessor Judd Buchanan, who referred to the land claims and demands for Indigenous self-government proposed by the Dene people in the Dene Declaration in the aftermath of the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry as \\"goobledegook\\", Allmand expressed public sympathy for their political demands of the Dene and the M√©tis. He was seemingly about to reach a land claim settlement agreement which would have granted much of the desired political autonomy when he was replaced by Hugh Faulkner in fall 1977. Faulkner backed away from the concessions that Allmand had made such as control over natural resources, instead proposing a cash settlement and land allotments similar to Indian reserves. This new position was criticized by the Dene and M√©tis leaders, and talks would not resume until 1981. His final cabinet post was as Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs from September 16, 1977 until June 3, 1979, when the Liberals were defeated and Progressive Conservative Joe Clark formed government after the 1979 federal election. = Opposition and return to backbenches = During the negotiations leading up to the patriation of the Constitution of Canada, Allmand, frequently suggested to his caucus colleagues, including those on the committee overseeing patriation, that the rights of Indigenous Peoples should be explicitly protected in any new constitution. Allmand's support lent credibility to the Indigenous cause, since he was a former Indian Affairs minister and longtime cabinet minister. Ultimately, Allmand voted against the Constitution Act, 1982 because of his opposition to the inclusion of the notwithstanding clause in Section 33 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms that allowed certain rights to be overridden by the national and provincial legislatures. He opposed Section 59 of the act, which delayed the implementation of Section 23 minority language education rights in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in Quebec until a time chosen by the Quebec National Assembly. After this vote, Allmand would never hold a Liberal cabinet position again. During Brian Mulroney's tenure as prime minister, Allmand held numerous Official Opposition critic portfolios. He was critic for Employment from October 1984 to September 1990. In 1988, conservative Catholics attacked Allmand for being \\"anti-life\\" for voting against amendments to the Criminal Code that would have criminalized abortion in Canada. Allmand, himself a Catholic, defended himself, saying that while he personally opposed the act of abortion, he did not believe abortion should be included in criminal law. Allmand was critic for arms control and disarmament as well as critic for Official Languages from 1990 to 1992, and critic for Immigration from 1992 to 1993. During this time, Allmand, who was the chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Tibet, hosted the 14th Dalai Lama's first visit to Canada in 1990. In 1995, he gained notoriety for voting against Minister of Finance Paul Martin's budget, as he was opposed to spending cuts that were deeper than promised during the 1993 election and because it did not cancel the Goods and Services Tax. As a result, Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien removed him from his position as chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice, a position he held from January 17, 1994 to February 2, 1996, although he remained in the Liberal caucus. Allmand said that Martin's budget cuts \\"broke traditional Liberal principles\\" and his willingness to vote against his own party's majority government emboldened other Liberal MPs to follow suit, such as John Nunziata and Dennis Mills. He retired before the 1997 election after Chr√©tien appointed him president of the Montreal-based International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development (later renamed Rights and Democracy) to replace Ed Broadbent, its first president.  Human rights activism  Allmand served as the president of the International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development from 1997 to 2002. During the 3rd Summit of the Americas, held in Quebec City in 2001, Allmand encouraged social activists boycotting the event to speak with governmental actors in order to collaboratively develop better policy. During his time at the centre, Allmand supported the work done on the International Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People. In the leadup to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, Allmand was an active participant in the negotiations via the Coalition for Peace in Ireland. During the negotiations, Allmand met Rosemary Nolan, whom he married in 2002. He also served as the international president of Parliamentarians for Global Action. In 2004, Allmand was elected President of the World Federalist Movement‚ÄìCanada, a position he held until his terminal illness led to his replacement in August 2016 by Walter Dorn. Allmand also served as a director of the Newman Centre of Montreal and CANADEM. In 2004, Allmand taught at McGill University as a visiting scholar at the Institute of Canadian Studies. In 2005, Allmand served as counsel for the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group during the Commission of Inquiry into the Actions of Canadian Officials in Relation to Maher Arar, and argued that Canada's national security agencies, especially the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, chose security over rights and were largely unaccountable when they did so.  Montreal municipal politics  In November 2005, Allmand was elected to the Montreal city council seat as a member of the Union Montr√©al party to represent Loyola, in the C√¥te-des-Neiges‚ÄìNotre-Dame-de-Gr√¢ce borough. Allmand's primary motivation for joining was to help oversee the city's implementation of its charter of rights that he had helped draft. Although Allmand had been recruited by then mayor G√©rald Tremblay for his party, he was not afraid to publicly criticize the mayor if he disagreed with city policy. Allmand voted against Tremblay's motion to change the name of Park Avenue to Avenue Robert Bourassa. During his time on the council, he criticized the lack of transparency in urban planning for projects in his seat of Notre-Dame-de- Gr√¢ce, while Michael Applebaum was mayor. Although he had risen to become the Vice President of the Montreal City Council, he did not choose to run again in the 2009 Montreal municipal election.  Later activities and death  In 2011, Allmand supported the Canadian Boat for Gaza, part of the Freedom Flotilla II that sought to deliver supplies to Palestinians. In Fall 2013, Allmand joined Foundation Board of Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East. In 2014, Allmand defended a legal argument, on behalf of the World Federalist Movement ‚Äì Canada, that challenged the Canadian government's implementation bill for the Convention on Cluster Munitions. He argued that a clause of the bill which gave Canada an explicit exemption in certain cases while participating in combined military operations with non-signatory allies such as the United States undermined the purpose of the convention. Allmand noted that Australia and New Zealand, two other American allies, had passed similar legislation without this exemption. Allmand was concerned that signing a treaty with the exception would encourage other countries to create their own exceptions. Allmand was diagnosed with a brain tumour in February 2016, and his condition worsened in October 2016. He then entered a palliative care centre at the Centre hospitalier de l'Universit√© de Montr√©al's H√¥pital Notre- Dame, where he died on December 7, 2016, at the age of 84. Allmand's funeral was held at St. Patrick's Basilica on December 19. Allmand was survived by his wife, a son and two daughters.  Honours, awards, and legacy  In 1977, Allmand was appointed Queen's Counsel for his contributions to the legal field. In 1990, the World Federalist Movement‚ÄìCanada honoured Allmand with its World Peace Award. In 2000, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada for being \\"committed to democracy and the pursuit of justice and fundamental freedoms.\\" In June 2006, Bishop's University granted him a Doctor of Civil Law honoris causa at its convocation ceremony. In 1999, in a list that Allmand submitted to the Great Canadian Book of Lists, he listed abolishing the death penalty as one of Canada's twelve most significant political events. After his death, Denis Coderre, the Mayor of Montreal, announced that the flags at Montreal City Hall would be flown at half-mast in his honour. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released a statement on Twitter saying that Allmand's \\"legacy will live on in the enormous contributions he made to Canada as an MP and Minister.\\"  Published works  Allmand published at least three books during this career: * Is there a future for progressive policies in Canada?

Four times a year, AALS publishes AALS News, a newsletter that keeps readers informed of AALS activities and topics of interest to the legal academy. Involvement in the Solomon Amendment The AALS requires its members to follow a nondiscrimination policy regarding \\"race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, disability, or sexual orientation,\\" and for member law schools to require this of any employer to which it gives access for recruitment. The United States Armed Forces \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" (DADT) policy was seen by the AALS as impermissible discrimination. However, the AALS excused its members from blocking access to the military since the passage of the Solomon Amendments, which denies federal funding to the parent university of a law school as well as the school itself if military recruiters are not given full campus access. However, the AALS at the time required schools to take \\"ameliorative\\" measures when allowing military recruiters on campus, including placing \\"warning\\" signs on campus when military recruiting takes place, scheduling interviews off campus away from \\"core\\" areas, \\"prohibit[ing] entirely the delivery of discretionary support services\\" to military recruiters, charging military employers who use law school resources \\"reasonable fees for use of law school staff, facilities and services,\\" etc.On-Campus Military Recruiting ‚Äì Balancing AALS Rules, Other Nondiscrimination Policies and the Solomon II Amendment, December 15, 1998, The AALS at the time encouraged law schools to deny benefits to military recruiters that they would ordinarily provide employers, such as coffee and free parking. Specifically, the AALS wrote in a memo to all law school deans in the United States: The AALS engaged in litigation challenging the Solomon Amendments as violative of the First Amendment (see e.g., Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.). In an interesting coincidence, The Judge Advocate General's School of the United States Army is a fee-paying nonmember of AALS. Although DADT has been ended, and although President Barack Obama called upon college campuses to welcome military recruiters during his State of the Union Speech (1/25/11), some law professors have questioned why the AALS has issued no statement declaring an end to its recommendations.DADT Repeal and On-Campus Military Recruiters, PrawfsBlawg, December 24, 2010, http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/2010/12/dadt-repeal-and-on-campus- military-recruiters.html  See also  * American Bar Association * Law School Admission Council * Law School Admission Test ReferencesExternal links * AALS official site * Becoming a Law Teacher Legal organizations based in the United States College and university associations and consortia in the United States Law schools in the United States Organizations established in 1900 Professional associations based in the United States Law-related learned societies ","title":"Association of American Law Schools"},{"id":"623762","text":"William Rivers Pitt (born November 9, 1971) is an author, editor, and political activist. Background William Rivers Pitt was born in Washington, D.C.; his father, Charles Redding Pitt, became chair of the Alabama State Democratic Party. He was educated in English literature at Holy Cross College, a Catholic college in Massachusetts. He taught English literature, journalism, grammar, and history at a small private school before joining the staff of the non-profit news organization Truthout. Writing career Pitt's book War on Iraq: What Team Bush Doesn't Want You to Know, with Scott Ritter, was published by Profile Books in 2002. It was an in-depth examination of the Bush administration's false WMD arguments set against testimony and data from a weapons ispector who oversaw the destruction of Iraq's stockpiles in the 1990s. In reviewing this book, The Guardian called it \\"the most comprehensive independent analysis of the state of knowledge about Iraq's weapons programmes until the new team of inspectors went back.\\" In December of 2002, the book appeared on the New York Times best-seller list, was an international best- seller, and was translated into 13 languages. Pitt's book The Greatest Sedition Is Silence: Four Years in America,\\" was published by Pluto Press in 2003. It is an analysis of U.S. politics in areas outside the push for war in Iraq, covering topics such as the Enron collapse, the media and Fox News, but primarily concentrates on the aftermath of the attacks of September 11. Pitt also published Our Flag, Too: The Paradox of Patriotism with Context Books in 2003. Pitt's book House of Ill Repute: Reflections on War, Lies, and America's Ravaged Reputation, was published by PoliPointPress in 2006. It serves as a second volume to Pitt's first book by compiling the myriad ways the Bush administration lied the U.S. into an invasion of Iraq, and documents the steep cost in blood, treasure and reputation brought by the war. Pitt's book The Mass Destruction of Iraq: The Disintegration of a Nation: Why It Is Happening, and Who Is Responsible, was published by Truthout in 2014. The book was co- authored by Truthout reporter Dahr Jamail, who traveled to Iraq after \\"Shock and Awe\\" and spent months as an unembedded journalist reporting from Fallujah and other hot spots in the war. Pitt and Jamail combined to create a searing indictment of the war, and of those who championed it in Washington D.C. Mass Destruction is the last volume of Pitt's trilogy on the war.

The Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system or Minnesota State System, previously branded as MnSCU, comprises 30 state colleges and 7 state universities with 54 campuses throughout Minnesota. The system is the largest higher education system in Minnesota (separate from the University of Minnesota system) and the fourth largest in the United States, educating more than 375,000 students annually. It is governed by a 15-member board of trustees appointed by the governor, which has broad authority to run the system. The Minnesota State system office is located in the Wells Fargo Place building in Saint Paul, Minnesota. In 2016, the Board of Trustees approved a rebranding of the system to the shortened Minnesota State. This change was met with criticism as this is also the nickname commonly attributed to Minnesota State University, Mankato. The change affected branding but did not alter the legal name of the organization that is identified in state statute. Commonly the system is now being referenced in media as the Minnesota State System, while the institution in Mankato is being referenced as Minnesota State.  History  In 1991, the Minnesota Legislature issued legislation which founded the creation of the Minnesota State system. Through this process the then-existing Minnesota state university system, community college system and technical college system were combined into a single higher education system. This initially was to be accomplished by 1995 but due to statewide opposition it wasn't until 1997 that a Central Office was formed and individual institutions began to operate under centralized direction. The members of the University of Minnesota could not be compelled by the legislature to be part of the new system because it had sued for independence in the form of constitutional autonomy from legislative oversight. This autonomy was affirmed by the Minnesota Supreme Court after the State of Minnesota was formed and was a response to lobbying demands from a newly formed Alumni Association of the University of Minnesota in the early 19th century. This difference in independence and power has led to significant differences in the way in which the State system operates and educates students. Through this legislation the State system was given the ad-hoc role of educating all students outside of the doctoral research role that the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities campus provides. In addition, individual university and college members have, by comparison, significantly smaller endowments, and receive less funding from the state government of Minnesota than comparable members of the University of Minnesota system. An appropriation by the state of Minnesota was supposed to cover 66% of the cost to educate students, and as of 2014 the state provides about 50%. Operations Minnesota State Colleges and Universities offer a wide range of collegiate programs from associates degrees to applied doctorates. All of the system's two-year community and technical colleges have an open admissions policy, which means that anyone with either a high school diploma or equivalent degree may enroll. The system also runs an online collaborative called Minnesota Online, which is a gateway to the online course offerings of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities. More than 150 academic programs are available completely or predominantly online. About 93,300 students took online courses during the 2009-2010 academic year. The economic impact of the Minnesota State system is estimated to be $8 billion per year, with a return of twelve dollars for every dollar invested. Tuition at Minnesota State Colleges and Universities is lower than tuition at the University of Minnesota, private universities, or private trade schools. More than 80 percent of graduates stay in Minnesota to work or continue their education. The job-placement rate based on the last available data at two-year colleges is 88.0 percent in 2006, meaning that 88.0 percent of graduates find jobs in their chosen fields. The Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system has not designated an official flagship institution , however, Minnesota State University, Mankato and Saint Cloud State University have been referred to as the system flagship at various points in time.

The word \\"isthmus\\" comes from the Ancient Greek word for \\"neck\\" and refers to the narrowness of the land.LSJ entry ŒπœÉŒ∏ŒºœåœÇ The Isthmus was known in the ancient world as the landmark separating the Peloponnese from mainland Greece. In the first century AD the geographer StraboStrabo, Geography. 9.1.6. noted a stele on the Isthmus of Corinth, which bore two inscriptions. One towards the East, i.e. towards Megara, reading: \\"Here is not Peloponnesus, but Ionia\\" () and the one towards the West, i.e. towards the Peloponnese: \\"Here is Peloponnesus, not Ionia\\" (); Plutarch ascribed the erection of the stele to the Attic hero Theseus, on his way to Athens.Plutarch, Parallel Lives , Theseus Plut. Thes. 25 To the west of the Isthmus is the Gulf of Corinth, to the east the Saronic Gulf. Since 1893 the Corinth Canal has run through the 6.3 km wide isthmus, effectively making the Peloponnese an island. Today, two road bridges, two railway bridges and two submersible bridges at both ends of the canal connect the mainland side of the isthmus with the Peloponnese side. Also a military emergency bridge is located at the west end of the canal. The submersible bridge at the Aegean side of canal History of the canal The idea for a shortcut to save boats sailing all round the Peloponnese was long considered by the Ancient Greeks. The first attempt to build a canal there was carried out by the tyrant Periander in the 7th century BC. He abandoned the project owing to technical difficulties, and instead constructed a simpler and less costly overland stone ramp, named Diolkos, as a portage road. Remnants of Diolkos still exist today next to the modern canal. When the Romans took control of Greece, a number of different solutions were tried. Julius Caesar foresaw the advantages of a link for his newly built Colonia Laus Iulia Corinthiensis. By the reign of Tiberius, engineers tried to dig a canal, but were defeated by lack of modern equipment. Instead they built an Ancient Egyptian device: boats were rolled across the isthmus on logs, as the Egyptians had rolled blocks of granite to make their pyramids. This was in use by AD 32. In AD 67, the philhellene Roman emperor Nero ordered 6,000 slaves to dig a canal with spades. Historian Flavius Josephus writes that the 6,000 slaves were Jewish pirates, taken captive by Vespasian during the Jewish wars.Flavius Josephus, The Wars of the Jews, Book 3 Chapter 10 paragraph 10 According to Pliny the Elder, the work advanced four stadia (about 0.8 kilometers).Pliny the Elder, The Natural History Plin. Nat. 4.5 The following year Nero died, and his successor Galba abandoned the project as being too expensive. In the modern era, the idea was first seriously proposed in 1830, soon after Greece's independence from the Ottoman Empire, and was brought to completion in 1893 after eleven years' work. =Preservation efforts= Near the canal runs an ancient stone trackway, the Diolkos, once used for dragging ships overland. There are major concerns about preservation of this path. Greek campaigners are calling for greater effort by the Greek government to protect this archaeological site.BBC report Hexamilion wall The Hexamilion wall is a Roman defensive wall constructed across the Isthmus of Corinth guarding the only land route into the Peloponnese peninsula from mainland Greece.

Colby was a Republican until he helped co-found the National Progressive Party in 1912; he ran for multiple offices as a member of that party, but never won. Secretary of State from February 1920 until 1921, at a time when President Woodrow Wilson was medically handicapped and largely out of touch, he is best known for promoting a Good Neighbor policy for Latin America, and for denouncing the communist regime in Russia. Early life and education Bainbridge Colby was born in St. Louis, Missouri on December 22, 1869. He graduated from Williams College (where he was admitted to Phi Beta Kappa),Politician members in Missouri, PoliticalGraveyard.com, accessed October 9, 2009 then attended Columbia Law School and New York Law School (1892). The Miller Center for Public Affairs, University of Virginia  Career  He was admitted to the New York bar, and served as a member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 29th D.) 1901‚Äì1902. He spoke at the Colby College commencement on June 19, 1933, at which time he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. =Politics= At the New York state election, 1914, Colby ran on the Progressive ticket for U.S. Senator from New York, but was defeated by Republican James W. Wadsworth, Jr. At the New York state election, 1916, he ran again, this time on the Progressive and Independence League tickets, but was defeated by Republican William M. Calder. During World War I, Colby was a member of the United States Shipping Board. Colby was a special assistant to the United States Attorney General in an anti-trust action in 1917, and represented the U.S. at the Inter-Allied Conference at Paris the same year. =Secretary of State= Wilson appointed him Secretary of State on March 23, 1920, after firing his predecessor, Robert Lansing, for insubordination. Wilson's appointment of Colby was \\"bizarre\\" says historian John Milton Cooper, for Colby had no diplomatic experience or skills. Editorial responses from leading newspapers ranged \\"from puzzlement to outrage.\\"John Milton Cooper, Woodrow Wilson: A Biography (2009) p 556 Colby was chosen because he was totally loyal to Wilson. On August 26, eight days after ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, Colby issued the official proclamation that it had become a part of the Constitution of the United States, guaranteeing women the right to vote. In December 1920, Colby embarked on the battleship for an official goodwill cruise to South America. His goodwill trip set the stage for the transition to a \\"Good Neighbor\\" policy.Smith, 1963 Colby advocated his policies firmly even as Wilson suffered the debilitating side effects of a series of strokes. Colby supported the League of Nations and established a precedent for not recognizing newly-Communist Russia; that would be reversed in 1933.McFadden, 1995 In a major statement in 1920, Colby declared: :It is not possible for the Government of the United States to recognize the present rulers of Russia as a government with which the relations common to friendly governments can be maintained. This conviction has nothing to do with any particular political or social structure which the Russian people themselves may see fit to embrace. It rests upon a wholly different set of facts....that the existing regime in Russia is based upon the negation of every principle of honor and good faith, and every usage and convention, underlying the whole structure of international law; the negation, in short, of every principle upon which it is possible to base harmonious and trustful relations, whether of nations or of individuals. The responsible leaders of the regime have frequently and openly boasted that they are willing to sign agreements and undertakings with foreign Powers while not having the slightest intention of observing such undertakings or carrying out such agreements....it is their understanding that the very existence of Bolshevism in Russia, the maintenance of their own rule, depends, and must continue to depend, upon the occurrence of revolutions in all other great civilized nations, including the United States, which will overthrow and destroy their governments and set up Bolshevist rule in their stead. They have made it quite plain that they intend to use every means, including, of course, diplomatic agencies, to promote such revolutionary movements in other countries. He served until Wilson left office on March 4, 1921. The Library of Congress maintains a collection of Colby‚Äôs documents.http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms011091 =Later career= After leaving office as secretary of state, Colby continued to practice law for the remainder of his career. As an attorney, Colby accepted Woodrow Wilson as a partner after the latter's presidency; Colby left that firm in 1923. Earlier in his career, Colby's most notable client was Mark Twain.  Personal life  Colby was married twice. His first wife was Nathalie Sedgwick, who became a novelist; they were married in 1895 and had three children (Katherine Sedgwick Colby, Nathalie Sedgwick Colby and Frances Bainbridge Colby). Colby decided to divorce his wife while he was in Paris in 1928. The divorce was finalized in Reno, Nevada later that year. The marriage apparently was very contentious and Colby felt the need to include in his divorce decree a monthly payment of $1,500.00 to stop Nathalie from \\"ridiculing him in her writings\\". Less than a year later, he married Anne Ahlstrand Ely, who was politically engaged in many of the same issues as Colby, such as women's suffrage. (As Secretary of State, Colby would issue the proclamation announcing that the 19th Amendment, guaranteeing women the right to vote, had been ratified as part of the U.S. Constitution.) When Colby died in 1950, his widow donated much memorabilia to the local library; it eventually found a home at the Library of Congress. She never remarried and died in 1963. At the time of his death, Colby was the last surviving member of the Wilson Cabinet.

It is distinct from parliamentary privilege, which applies only to those peers serving in the House of Lords and the members of the House of Commons, while Parliament is in session and forty days before and after a Parliamentary session. The privileges have been lost and eroded over time. Only three survived into the 20th century: the right to be tried by other peers of the realm instead of juries of commoners, freedom from arrest in civil (but not criminal) cases, and access to the Sovereign to advise him or her on matters of state. The right to be tried by other peers was abolished in 1948. Legal opinion considers the right of freedom from arrest as extremely limited in application, if at all. The remaining privilege is not exercised and was recommended for formal abolition in 1999, but has never been formally revoked. Peers also have several other rights not formally part of the privilege of peerage. For example, they are entitled to use coronets and supporters on their achievements of arms.  Extent  The privilege of peerage extends to all temporal peers and peeresses regardless of their position in relation to the House of Lords. The right to sit in the House is separate from the privilege, and is held by only some peers (see History of reform of the House of Lords). Scottish peers from the Acts of Union 1707 and Irish peers from the Act of Union 1800, therefore, have the privilege of peerage. From 1800, Irish peers have had the right to stand for election to the United Kingdom House of Commons but they lose the privilege of peerage for the duration of their service in the lower House. Since 1999, hereditary peers of England, Scotland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom who are not members of the House of Lords may stand for election to the House of Commons. Their privilege of peerage is not explicitly lost by service in the lower House. Any peer issuing a disclaimer under the provisions of the Peerage Act 1963 loses all privileges of peerage. The privilege of peerage also extends to wives and widows of peers. A peeress by marriage loses the privilege upon marrying a commoner, but a peeress suo jure does not. Individuals who hold courtesy titles, however, do not have such privileges by virtue of those titles. Lords Spiritual (the 26 Archbishops and Bishops who sit in the House of Lords) do not have the privilege of peerage as, at least since 1621, they have been Lords of Parliament, and not peers.  Trial by peers  c. 1810. Just as commoners have a right to trial by a jury of their equals (other commoners), peers and peeresses formerly had a right to trial by other peers. The right of peers to trial by their own order was formalized during the 14th century. A statute passed in 1341 provided:15 Edward III., st. 1, sec. 2. quoted in Spooner, Lysander (1852). \\"An Essay on the Trial by Jury.\\" Boston: Hobart and Robbins.

The privilege of trial by peers was still ill-defined, and the statute did not cover peeresses. In 1442, after an ecclesiastical court (which included King Henry VI of England, Henry Beaufort and John Kemp) found Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester, guilty of witchcraft and banished her to the Isle of Man, a statute was enacted granting peeresses the right of trial by peers. By the reign of Henry VII of England, there were two methods of trial by peers of the realm: trial in the House of Lords (or, in proper terms, by the High Court of Parliament) and trial in the Court of the Lord High Steward. The House of Lords tried the case if Parliament was in session; otherwise, trial was by the Lord High Steward's Court.Pike, pp.218‚Äì227 In the Lord High Steward's Court, a group of Lords Triers, sitting under the chairmanship of the Lord High Steward, acted as judge and jury. By custom the number of Triers was not fewer than 23, so that a majority was a minimum of 12, but in fact the number ranged from 20 to 35. The power to choose which peers served as Triers lay with the Crown and was sometimes subject to abuse, as only those peers who agreed with the monarch's position would be summoned to the Court of the Lord High Steward, thereby favouring the desired verdict. This practice was ended by the Treason Act 1695, passed during the reign of King William III. The Act required that all peers be summoned as Triers. All subsequent trials were held before the full House of Lords. In the House of Lords, the Lord High Steward was the President or Chairman of the Court, and the entire House determined both questions of fact and questions of law as well as the verdict. By convention, Bishops and Archbishops did not vote on the verdict, though they were expected to attend during the course of the trial. They sat until the conclusion of the deliberations, and withdrew from the chamber just prior to the final vote.Pike, p.227 At the end of the trial, peers voted on the question before them by standing and declaring their verdict by saying \\"guilty, upon my honour\\" or \\"not guilty, upon my honour\\", starting with the most junior baron and proceeding in order of precedence ending with the Lord High Steward. For a guilty verdict, a majority of twelve was necessary. The entire House also determined the punishment to be imposed, which had to accord with the law.Pike, pp.230‚Äì231 For capital crimes the punishment was death; the last peer to be executed was Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers, who was hanged for murder in 1760. From 1547, if a peer or peeress was convicted of a crime, except treason or murder, he or she could claim \\"privilege of peerage\\" to escape punishment if it was their first offence. In all, the privilege was exercised five times,Baron Morley found guilty of manslaughter in 1666; the Earl of Pembroke found guilty of manslaughter in 1678; the Earl of Warwick and Holland found guilty of manslaughter in 1699; Lord Byron found guilty of manslaughter in 1765; and the Duchess of Kingston found guilty of bigamy in 1776. until it was formally abolished in 1841 when James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan, announced he would claim the privilege and avoid punishment if he was convicted of duelling. He was acquitted before the introduction of the bill. The last trial in the House of Lords was that of Edward Russell, 26th Baron de Clifford, in 1935 for manslaughter (he was acquitted); the following year the Lords passed a bill to abolish trial by peers but the Commons ignored it. The right to trial by peers was abolished when the Lords added an amendment to the Criminal Justice Act 1948, which the Commons accepted. Now peers are tried by juries composed of commoners, though peers were themselves excused from jury service until the House of Lords Act 1999 restricted this privilege to members of the House of Lords. The right to be excused was abolished on 5 April 2004 by the Criminal Justice Act 2003.Schedule 33, paragraph 1; brought into force by the third commencement order, article 2. (Peers were, and still are hypothetically, subject to impeachment. Impeachment was a procedure distinct from the aforementioned procedure of trial in the House of Lords, though the House of Lords is the court in both cases. Charges were brought by the House of Commons, not a grand jury. Additionally, while in normal cases the House of Lords tried peers only for felonies or treason, in impeachments the charges could include felonies, treason and misdemeanours. The case directly came before the House of Lords, rather than being referred to it by a writ of certiorari. The Lord High Steward presided only if a peer was charged with high treason; otherwise the Lord Chancellor presided. Other procedures in trials of impeachment were similar, however, to trials before the House of Lords: at the conclusion of the trial, the spiritual peers withdrew, and the temporal Lords gave their votes on their honour. The last impeachment was that of Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, in 1806 for misappropriating public money (he was acquitted). Since then, impeachment has become an obsolete procedure in the United Kingdom.) The novel Clouds of Witness (1926) by Dorothy L. Sayers depicts the fictional trial in the House of Lords of a duke who is accused of murder. Sayers researched and used the then current trial procedures. Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949) comedy from Ealing Studios features an almost identical scene.  Freedom from arrest  The privilege of freedom from arrest applies to members of both Houses of Parliament, because of the principle that they must, whenever possible, be available to give advice to the Sovereign. Several other nations have copied this provision; the Constitution of the United States, for example, provides, \\"The Senators and Representatives ... shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses.\\" Theoretically, even when Parliament is not sitting, peers enjoy the privilege because they continue to serve the Sovereign as counsellors. However, peers are free from arrest in civil cases only; arrests in criminal matters are not covered by the privilege. Until 1770, a peer's domestic servants were also covered by the privilege of freedom from arrest in civil matters. Most often the privilege was applied in cases of imprisonment in debtors' prisons. In 1870, both imprisonment for debt and the privilege in relation to freedom from arrest for bankruptcy were abolished, and as a result the freedom became extremely limited in practical application. Now, civil proceedings involve arrests only when an individual disobeys a court order. Since 1945, the privilege of freedom from arrest in civil cases has arisen in only two cases: Stourton v Stourton (1963) and Peden International Transport, Moss Bros, The Rowe Veterinary Group and Barclays Bank plc v Lord Mancroft (1989). In the latter most recent case, the trial judge considered the privilege obsolete and inapplicable, and said in proceedings, \\"the privilege did not apply‚Äîindeed ... it is unthinkable in modern times that, in circumstances such as they are in this case, it should\\".  Access to the Sovereign  The Sovereign is traditionally advised by various counsellors, including the peers of the realm. After the Norman conquest of England, peers were summoned to form the magnum concilium, or Great Council, which was one of the four councils belonging to the Sovereign. The other three were the Privy Council, Parliament (which was called the commune concilium, or Common Council), and judges (who are considered counsellors of the Sovereign on legal matters). A council composed only of peers was often summoned by early English Kings. Such a council, having been in disuse for centuries, was revived in 1640, when Charles I summoned all of the peers of the realm using writs issued under the Great Seal. Though such a council has not been summoned since then, and was considered obsolete at the time, each peer is commonly considered a counsellor of the Sovereign, and, according to Sir William Blackstone in 1765, \\"it is usually looked upon to be the right of each particular peer of the realm, to demand an audience of the King, and to lay before him, with decency and respect, such matters as he shall judge of importance to the public weal.\\"Blackstone, W. (1765). Commentaries on the Laws of England. Book 1, Chapter 5 Oxford: Clarendon Press. The privilege of access is no longer exercised, but it is possibly still retained by peers whether members of the House of Lords or not.Noel Cox, Professor of Law at Auckland University of Technology, quoted in Journal of the Hereditary Peerage Association. No. 5 2007. Retrieved on 2007-11-08. In 1999, the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege recommended the formal abolition of any remaining privilege of peerage.  Scandalum magnatum  At one time, the honour of peers was especially protected by the law; while defamation of a commoner was known as libel or slander, the defamation of a peer (or of a Great Officer of State) was called scandalum magnatum. Eighteenth century jurist Sir William Blackstone opined: > \\"The honour of peers is so highly tendered by the law, that it is much more > penal to spread false reports of them, and certain other great officers of > the realm, than of other men; scandal against them being called by the > peculiar name of scandalum magnatum, and subject to peculiar punishments by > divers ancient statutes.\\" The Statute of Westminster of 1275 provided that \\"from henceforth none be so hardy to tell or publish any false News or Tales, whereby discord, or occasion of discord or slander may grow between the King and his People, or the Great Men of the Realm.\\"3 Edw. 1, Stat.

Retrieved on 2007-10-19. and in Pike, p.265 Scandalum magnatum was both a tort and a criminal offence. The prohibition on scandalum magnatum was first enforced by the King's Council. During the reign of Henry VII, the Star Chamber, a court formerly reserved for trial of serious offences such as rioting, assumed jurisdiction over scandalum magnatum, as well as libel and slander, cases. The court, which sat without a jury and in secret, was often used as a political weapon and a device of royal tyranny, leading to its abolition in 1641; its functions in respect of defamation cases passed to the common law courts. However, the number of cases had already dwindled as the laws of libel, slander and contempt of court developed in its place. In the reign of Charles II, scandalum magnatum came briefly back into fashion; it was used by the future James II against Titus Oates, by Lord Gerard against his cousin Alexander Fitton, and by the Duke of Beaufort against John Arnold. By the end of the 18th century, however, scandalum magnatum was obsolete. This specific category of the offence of defamation was finally repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1887.Statute Law Revision Act, 1887 (U.K.), 50 and 51 Vict., c. 59 quoted in R. v. Z√ºndel.

The most persistent example of such a legend is that of the Kingsale hat. According to the fable, John de Courcy, Earl of Ulster, obtained from King John the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the Sovereign. Though the tale is untrue‚Äîde Courcy was never made an earl and did not receive such a privilege (Subscription required)Complete Peerage, Vol. XII, part 2; pp. 166‚Äì169. He was granted all the land of Ulster, and promised the Earldom; but the first Earl of Ulster was Hugh de Lacy, his enemy, who was granted both land and Earldom when King John quarrelled with Courcy; Lacy witnessed a document as Earl on 1205.‚Äîseveral authorities on the peerage have seen fit to repeat it. A 19th-century edition of Burke's Peerage suggests the origins of the privilege:A Genealogical and heraldic dictionary of the peerage and baronetage of the British Empire. 1880 ed. p.702 (sub Kingsale); changed by the 85th edition of 1927. :... the Earl of Ulster was treacherously seized while performing penance, unarmed and barefooted, in the churchyard of Downpatrick, on Good Friday, anno 1203, and sent over to England, where the king condemned him to perpetual imprisonment in the Tower ... After de Courcy had been in confinement about a year, a dispute happening to arise between King John and Philip Augustus of France concerning the Duchy of Normandy, the decision of which being referred to single combat, King John, more hasty than advised, appointed the day, against which the King of France provided his champion; but the King of England, less fortunate, could find no one of his subjects willing to take up the gauntlet, until his captive in the Tower, the stout Earl of Ulster, was prevailed upon to accept the challenge. But when everything was prepared for the contest, and the champions had entered the lists, in presence of the Kings of England, France and Spain, the opponent of the earl, seized with a sudden panic, put spurs to his horse, and fled the arena; whereupon the victory was adjudged by acclamation to the champion of England. The French king being informed, however, of the earl's powerful strength, and wishing to witness some exhibition of it, de Courcy, at the desire of King John, cleft a massive helmet in twain at a single blow. To reward his singular performance, King John supposedly granted de Courcy the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the Sovereign. The 1823 edition of Debrett's Peerage gives an entirely fictitious account of how Almericus de Courcy, 23rd Baron Kingsale, asserted the privilege:Quoted at Mists of Antiquity Chapter 3: Debrett's and Burke's. The Baronage Press Ltd and Pegasus Associates Ltd. Retrieved on 2007-10-19. :Being very handsome in his person, and of a tall stature, his lordship one day attended King William's court, and being admitted into the presence-chamber, asserted the privilege of being covered before his majesty, by walking to and fro with his hat on his head. The king observing him, sent one of his attendants to inquire the reason of his appearance before him with his head covered; to whom he replied, he knew very well in whose presence he stood, and the reason why he wore his hat that day was, because he stood before the king of England. This answer being told the king, and his lordship approaching nearer the throne, was required by his majesty to explain himself, which he did to this effect: \\"May it please your majesty, my name is Courcy, and I am Lord of Kingsale in your kingdom of Ireland: the reason of my appearing covered in your majesty's presence is, to assert the ancient privilege of my family, granted to sir John de Courcy, earl of Ulster, and his heirs, by John, king of England, for him and his successors for ever.\\" The king replied, he remembered he had such a nobleman, and believed the privilege he asserted to be his right, and giving him his hand to kiss, his lordship paid his obeisance, and remained covered. Despite such inaccuracies, the tale has been frequently repeated. Individual privileges that did exist have fallen into disuse‚Äîfor example the Lord of the Manor of Worksop (which is not a peerage) was extended the privilege and duty of attending the coronation of the British monarch until 1937, but the right was not exercised at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 as the manor was under corporate ownership at the time.

Garner: Thomson Reuters, 2014), p. 1306. or queen's peace, is the common-law concept of the maintenance of public order.Markus Dirk Dubber, The Police Power: Patriarchy and the Foundations of American Government (Columbia University Press, 2005), pp. 15‚Äì16. The concept of the king's peace originated in Anglo-Saxon law, where it initially applied the special protections accorded to the households of the English kings and their retainers. A breach of the king's peace, which could be either a crime or a tort, was a serious matter. The concept of the king's peace expanded in the 10th and 11th centuries to accord the king's protection to particular times (such as holidays), places (such as highways and churches), and individuals (such as legates). By the time of the Norman Conquest, the notion of the king's peace became more general, referring to the safeguarding of public order more broadly. In subsequent centuries, those responsible for enforcing the king's peace (besides the king himself) included the King's Bench and various local officials, including the sheriff, coroner, justice of the peace, and constable. In modern Britain, the police services are responsible for keeping the peace, a duty distinct from their duty of law enforcement. The concept has remained relevant in English law; in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Northumbria Police Authority (1989), the Court of Appeal for England and Wales held that the government could exercise prerogative powers to maintain the peace of the realm. In English law=Development in common law=Anglo-Saxon origins The notion of \\"king's peace\\" originates in Anglo-Saxon law.Bruce R. O'Brien, God's Peace and King's Peace: The Laws of Edward the Confessor, pp. 73‚Äì74. Historian Bruce R. O'Brien notes that the concept was \\"a vague statement of the inviolability of the king or his palace\\" under the early English kings. Maitland and Pollock describe the origins of the concept of the king's peace as arising from (1) \\"the special sanctity of the king's house\\" (the royal household or mund), \\"which may be regarded as differing only in degree from that which Germanic usage attached everywhere to the homestead of a free man\\"; and (2) \\"the special protection of the king's attendants and servants, and other persons who he thought fit to place on the same footing.\\" Thus, Maitland and Pollock noted that \\"breach of the king's peace was an act of personal disobedience, and a much graver matter than an ordinary breach of the public order; it made the wrongdoer the king's enemy\\" who could be declared an outlaw. Over time, the notion of king's peace expanded, particularly in the 10th and 11th centuries. The expansion of the concept coincided with the expansion of the king's household to encompass governmental institutions, including the chancery, exchequer, chamber, and royal courts of law. Under the reigns of √Üthelred and Cnut, the concept of king's peace had already extended to designated times, places, individuals, and institutions.John Hudson, The Oxford History of the Laws of England, Vol. 2 (Oxford University Press, 2012), pp. 386‚Äì88. Individuals and institutions under the king's peace included legates, churches, and assemblies. Following the Norman Conquest Henry I's coronation charter, issued in 1100, stated: \\"I establish a lasting peace throughout the whole of my kingdom and command that it henceforth be maintained.\\"alt=An image of Henry I on a throne at his coronation. Following the Norman Conquest, the \\"king's peace\\" had extended to refer to \\"the normal and general safeguard of public order\\" in the realm, although specially granted peaces continued to be given after this period. Under the Leges Edwardi Confessoris (Laws of Edward the Confessor), the four great highways of the realm (the Roman roads of Watling Street, Icknield Street, Ermine Street, and Fosse Way) as well as navigable rivers were also under the king's peace. William Stubbs, The Constitutional History of England, in Its Origin and Development, Vol. 1 (1875: Cambridge University Press compilation, 2011), p. 182. The Leges Edwardi Confessoris provided that the weeks for Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost were under the king's peace as well. Maitland commented that the king's peace had begun to \\"swallow up lesser peaces\\" such as the peaces of local lords of the manor.Clifford Shearing & Phillip Stenning, \\"The Privatization of Security: Implications for Democracy\\" in Routledge Handbook of Private Security Studies (eds. Rita Abrahamsen & Anna Leander: Routledge, 2016), pp. 140‚Äì41. For example, roads other than the four great Roman roads were formerly under the sheriffs' peace, but by the end of the 14th century had been brought under the king's peace. A breach of the king's peace could be either a crime or a tort; one who breached the king's peace could be pursued by an appeal of felony or writ of trespass (brought by the victim of the breach) or by an indictment of felony or indictment of trespass (brought on behalf of the king, frequently at the request of the victim).David J. Seipp, \\"The Distinction Between Crime and Tort in the Early Common Law,\\" 76 B.U. L. Rev. 59 (1996). One who breached the king's peace was subject to punishment for both the breach and for the underlying conduct, which could be in the form of a fine, forfeiture, imprisonment, corporal punishment, or capital punishment. The Charter of Henry I, issued upon Henry's coronation in 1100, stated: \\"I establish a lasting peace throughout the whole of my kingdom and command that it henceforth be maintained.\\" Historian John Hudson had commented that Henry I's cornational declaration of peace was non- specific, but did emphasize \\"the association of both the ideals and the practical enforcement of good order with firm kingship\\" as characterized by, among other things, an expansion of royal judicial activity. Hudson writes: \\"Thus the later precise legal notion of the king's peace may have developed more from ideas of the general king's peace, as manifest perhaps in shrieval grants and Henry's coronation decree, than from specific grants of royal protection.\\" The binding over power of magistrates, which was first codified in the Justices of the Peace Act 1361, has partial roots in the early use of sureties of the peace, which \\"emerged from the peace-keeping arrangements of Anglo-Saxon law, extended by the use of the royal prerogative and royal writs to bestow the king's peace where the king wished until the peace became a nationwide legal reality.\\"Feldman, p. 102. Sureties of the peace were replaced in the 13th and 14th centuries, as the institutions of keeper of the peace and then justice of the peace were established. The 19th-century legal commentator James Fitzjames Stephen wrote that the conservators of the king's peace were the king, the great officers of state, and the King's Bench on the national level, and the sheriffs, coroners, justices of the peace, and constables on the local level.James Fitzjames Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of England (1883: Cambridge University Press compilation, 2014), p. 185. Law of homicide In traditional common law, a killing of a human was a murder only if the victim was \\"under the king's peace\\" (i.e., not an outlaw or an enemy soldier in wartime).R.A. Duff, Answering for Crime: Responsibility and Liability in the Criminal Law (Hart, 2007), p. 212.Malcolm Thorburn, \\"Punishment and Public Authority\\" in Criminal Law and the Authority of the State (eds. Antje du Bois-Pedain, Magnus Ulv√§ng & Petter Asp: Hart, 2017), p. 24. This was predicated on the notion that, because the outlaw lived outside the king's peace, the king would not punish offenses against the outlaw. Historically, even homicides se defendendo (in self-defense) were considered offenses against the king, in that they deprived the king of the use of his subjects. As a result, killings in self-defense were treated as an excuse that required a royal pardon, rather than a justified act.Markus Dubber & Tatjana H√∂rnle, Criminal Law: A Comparative Approach (Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 524.Alan Norrie, Crime, Reason and History: A Critical Introduction to Criminal Law (3d ed: Cambridge University Press, 2014), p. 301.Markus D. Dubber, \\"Histories of Crime and Criminal Justices and the Historical Analysis of Criminal Law\\" in The Oxford Handbook of the History of Crime and Criminal Justice (eds. Paul Knepper & Anja Johansen: Oxford University Press, 2016), p. 605. Similarly, the maiming of a person was an offense against the king because it reduced \\"the value of a human resource, in this case, by rendering him incapable of military service.\\" =Modern day= Today, the preservation of the queen's peace is the major responsibility of police services.Police Accountability and Control Over the Police, Bramshill Journal, Vol. 1 (Autumn 1979), pp. 9‚Äì14.Nick Tilley & Gloria Laycock, \\"The Police As Professional Problem Solvers\\" in The Future of Policing (ed. Jennifer M. Brown: Routledge, 2014), p. 369. Lord Scarman, in his report on the 1981 Brixton riot, defined the \\"Queen's peace\\" as the maintenance of \\"the normal state of society\\" (i.e., a \\"state of public tranquility\\") and defined it as the first duty of a police officer, ahead of the second duty of enforcing the law.Michael S. Pike, The Principles of Policing (Macmillan Press, 1985), pp. 36, 139. In a 2011 speech to the Police Foundation, Lord Judge (the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales) said, \\"The concept Queen's Peace as it now is, unbreakably linked with the common law, is arguably the most cherished of all the ideas from our medieval past, still resonating in the modern world.\\"Police Foundation's John Harris Memorial Lecture, Drapers Hall, London (7 July 2011). He noted that the police officers take an oath to \\"cause the peace to be kept and preserved and prevent all offences against people and property.\\" In the controversial decision in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Northumbria Police Authority (1989), the Court of Appeal for England and Wales held that the Home Secretary could exercise prerogative powers to maintain the peace of the realm. The court thus ruled that the Home Secretary had the power to purchase crowd control devices, such as plastic bullets and CS gas, even without statutory authorization or the approval of the local police authority.Andrew Le Sueur, Maurice Sunkin & Jo Eric Khushal Murkens, Public Law: Text, Cases, and Materials (2d ed.: Oxford University Press, 2013), pp. 348‚Äì50. Breach of the peace In modern English law, a breach of the peace is not itself a crime.Orsolya Sal√°t, The Right to Freedom of Assembly: A Comparative Study (Hart, 2015, pp. 121‚Äì24).David Pollard, Neil Parpworth & David Hughes, Constitutional and Administrative Law: Text with Materials (4th ed.: Oxford University Press, 2007), pp. 637‚Äì40. However, \\"where a breach of the peace has been committed or, alternatively, where such a breach is reasonably believed to be imminent, a police officer, or for that matter a member of the public, has the power at common law to arrest without warrant the individual or individuals who have either committed or are about to commit that breach of the peace even though no offence has actually been committed.\\" This is a form of preventive arrest.Colin Turpin & Adam Tomkins, British Government and the Constitution: Text and Materials (7th ed.: Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 823. Under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, a magistrate has the power to \\"bind over\\" a person to keep the peace (i.e., to forfeit a sum of money upon a subsequent breach of the peace), and \\"refusal to be bound over keep the peace is an offence in English law, punishable by up to six months' imprisonment.\\" Moreover, the obstruction of an officer engaged in preventing of breach of the peace is a criminal offense. The case R v Howell (1981) defined breach of the peace as \\"harm ... actually done or likely to be done to a person or, in his presence, his property or is put in fear of being harmed through an assault, affray, riot, unlawful assembly or other disturbance.\\" In the 1998 case of Steel v UK, the European Court of Human Rights decided that this was a lawful restriction of the freedom of assembly under Article 5 and Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Medieval Scotland Unlike medieval England, there is no strong evidence \\"for a strong conceptual and ideological royal peace\\" concept in medieval Scotland; however, historian Alan Harding argues that 12th-century royal brieves of protection issued by Scottish kings implicitly reflect the same concept. Historian Patrick Wormald suggests that Anglo-Saxon law and Scots law developed in parallel, and that the \\"seminal notion of vesting social security in the protection afforded by the king's peace\\" applied in both Scotland and England, with very early origins. Outside Britain=American law= After the American Revolution, American law merely adapted the common-law concept of the king's peace to refer to the maintenance of public order, and the concept of \\"an offense against the king's peace\\" to refer to an offense against the new sovereignthe people or the state. In the United States, the common law offense of breach of the peace was supplanted by the statutory offense of disturbing the peace. The separate offense of disorderly conduct has no common-law roots, but in most U.S. jurisdictions this offense \\"often is indistinguishable from\\" disturbing the peace.Philip Carlan, Lisa S. Nored & Ragan A. Downey, An Introduction to Criminal Law (Jones & Bartlett, 2011), p. 128. The application of criminal statutes on disturbing the peace and disorderly conduct have been limited by constitutional jurisprudence on the First Amendment, including the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings in Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942) and Colten v. Kentucky (1972). =Australian law= As a common-law nation, the notion of \\"breach of the Queen's peace\\" endures in Australia.Lipohar v R (1999) 200 CLR 485 (judgment by Gleeson CJ). In the High Court of Australia decision Lipohar v R (1999), a decision dealing with jurisdiction to try a case for the common-law crime of conspiracy to defraud, Justices Gaudron, Gummow, and Hayne quoted a 1973 decision by the English judge Lord Wilberforce that \\"the common law treats certain actions as crimes\\" on the ground that the \\"actions in question are a threat to the Queen's peace, or, as we would now perhaps say, to society.\\"Lipohar v R (1999) 200 CLR 485 (judgment by Gaudron J; Gummow J; Hayne J). Significance in historiography and history of crime The concept of the king's peace is significant in the historiography of medieval England, particularly regarding the study of the origin of the idea of crime.Alice Taylor, The Shape of the State in Medieval Scotland, 1124‚Äì1290 (Oxford University Press, 2016), p. 165. Black's Law Dictionary defines the term as \\"the king's guarantee of peace and security of life and property to all within his protection.\\" The notion of the king's peace is linked to the idea of police power and, more generally, sovereign power.

Temple of the Emerald Buddha The Ramakien (, , ; literally \\"Glory of Rama\\"; sometimes also spelled Ramakian) is Thailand's national epic, derived from the Buddhist Dasharatha Jataka . \\"King Rama VI was the person who shed the light first on the Ramayana studies in Thailand, by tracing the sources of the Ramakien, comparing with the Sanskrit Valmiki Ramayana. He found that Ramakien was influenced by three sources: the Valmiki's Ramayana, the Vishnu Purana, and Hamuman Nataka.\\"Lipi Ghosh, 2017, India-Thailand Cultural Interactions: Glimpses from the Past to Present, Springer Publishing, pp. 157 , in addition to its core story based on Buddhist Dasharatha Jataka.A number of versions of the epic were lost in the destruction of Ayutthaya in 1767. Three versions currently exist, one of which was prepared in 1797 under the supervision of (and partly written by) King Rama I. His son, Rama II, rewrote some parts of his father's version for khon drama. The work has had an important influence on Thai literature, art and drama (both the khon and nang dramas being derived from it). While the main story is similar to that of the Dasharatha Jataka differences in some tales still prevail, many other aspects were transposed into a Thai context, such as the clothes, weapons, topography, and elements of nature, which are described as being Thai in style. Since Thailand is considered a Theravada Buddhist society, the Buddhist History latent in the Ramakien serves to provide Thai legends with a creation myth, as well as representations of various spirits which complement beliefs derived from Thai animism. A painted representation of the Ramakien is displayed at Bangkok's Wat Phra Kaew, and many of the statues there depict characters from it. Background The Tipitaka, the liturgical text of Theravadan Buddhists , contains the Dasharatha Jataka, that is believed by many archaeologists and historians to be a collection of stories based on life of Rama Pandita, who was the past birth of Gotama Buddha the King of Ayodhya who lived in 7th century BCE (although this timeline is a matter of research), concentrating on the work of the gods in the lives of men, and it's Brahmanical counterpart(Ramayana) was first written down, as legend states, in the forests of India by Valmiki in the 4th century BCE.Julia Leslie, Authority and Meaning in Indian Religions: Hinduism and the Case of Valmiki, Ashgate (2003), p. 154. Nevertheless, the Ramayana came to Southeast Asia by means of Indian traders and scholars who traded with the Khmer kingdoms (such as Funan and Angkor) and Srivijaya, with whom the Indians shared close economic and cultural ties. In the late first millennium, the epic was adopted by the Thai people. Ramakien (written as Ramkerti, ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏£‡∏ï‡∏¥‡πå but read as Ramakien) The oldest recordings of the early Sukhothai kingdom, dating from the 13th century, include stories from the Ramayana legends. The history of the legends was told in the shade theater (Thai: ‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏á, Nang), a shadow-puppet show in a style adopted from Indonesia, in which the characters were portrayed by leather dolls manipulated to cast shadows on a nearby screen while the spectators watched from the other side. The Thai version of the legends were first written down in the 18th century, during the Ayutthaya kingdom, following the demise of the Sukhothai government. Most editions, however, were lost when the city of Ayutthaya was destroyed by armies from Burma (modern Myanmar) in the year 1767. The version recognized today was compiled in the Kingdom of Siam under the supervision of King Rama I (1726‚Äì1809), the founder of the Chakri dynasty, which still maintains the throne of Thailand. Between the years of 1799 and 1807, Rama I supervised the writing of the well-known edition and even wrote parts of it. It was also under the reign of Rama I that construction began on the Thai Grand Palace in Bangkok, which includes the grounds of the Wat Phra Kaew, the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. The walls of the Wat Pra Kaew are lavishly decorated with paintings representing stories from the Ramakien. Rama II (1766‚Äì1824) further adapted his father's edition of the Ramakien for the khon drama, a form of theater performed by non-speaking Thai dancers with elaborate costumes and masks. Narrations from the Ramakien were read by a chorus to one side of the stage. This version differs slightly from the one compiled by Rama I, giving an expanded role to Hanuman, the god-king of the apes, and adding a happy ending. Since its introduction to the Thai people, the Ramakien has become a firm component of the culture. The Ramakien of Rama I is considered one of the masterpieces of Thai literature. It is still read, and is taught in the country's schools. In 1989, Satyavrat Shastri translated the Ramakien into a Sanskrit epic poem (mahakavya) named Ramakirtimahakavyam, in 25 sargas (cantos) and about 1200 stanzas in 14 metres. This work won eleven national and international awards.Sanskrit‚Äôs first Jnanpith winner is a 'poet by instinct' Content The tales of the Ramakien are similar to those of the Ramayana, though transferred to the topography and culture of Ayutthaya, where the Avatar of Pra Narai (the Thai incarnation of Vishnu, who's also known as Narayan) is reborn as Pra Ram. =Main figures=Gods * Phra Narai/Witsanu * Phra Isuan * Phra Phrom ‚Äì altogether with Phra Isuan and Phra Narai, forms the Hindu Trinity. * Phra Uma-thewi ‚Äì Consort of Phra Isuan * Phra Laksami ‚Äì Consort of Narai * Phra In ‚Äì The King of thevadas ‚Äì lesser celestial deities.

The name means \\"Glory of Rama\\". The earliest mention of this epic's manuscript in Cambodia dated back in 7th century based on Veal Kantel inscription (K.359). While, the surviving text of Reamker dates from 16th century. Reamker adapts the Hindu ideas to Buddhist themes and shows the balance of good and evil in the world. More than just a reordering of the epic tale, the Reamker is a mainstay of the royal ballet's repertoire. Like the Ramayana, it is a philosophical allegory, exploring the ideals of justice and fidelity as embodied by the protagonists, King Rama and Queen Sita. The epic is well known among the Khmer people for its portrayal in Khmer dance theatre, called the L'khaon, in various festivals across Cambodia. Scenes from the Reamker are painted on the walls of the Royal Palace in Khmer style, and its predecessor is carved into the walls of the Angkor Wat and Banteay Srei temples. It is considered an integral part of Cambodian culture. The Reamker differs from the original Ramayana in some ways, featuring additional scenes and emphasis on Hanuman and Sovanna Maccha. In the Reamker, issues of trust, loyalty, love, and revenge play out in dramatic encounters among princes and giants, monkeys and mermaids, and a forlorn princess. Though it is understood that Preah Ream is an incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu, his characteristics and those of the others in the story are interpreted in Cambodia as those of mere mortals, not of the gods as is the case in India. The complex interplay of strengths and weaknesses, though couched in episodes lined with magic, nonetheless represents a decidedly human social behavior. As in other Southeast Asian countries, the Rama story in Cambodia is not confined to the realm of literature but extends to all Cambodian art forms, from sculpture to dance drama, painting and art. Another epic, Lpoek Angkor Vat (‚ÄúThe Story of Angkor Wat‚Äù), which dates from the beginning of the 17th century, celebrates the magnificent temple complex at Angkor and describes the bas-reliefs in the temple galleries that portray the Rama story. History A scene from the Reamker; a battle between Rama and Ravana performed in the courtyard of the Silver Pagoda, c. 1900s~1920s The original Ramayana arrived to Southeast Asia from South India along with Hinduism, but its retelling there suggests Buddhist influence. The exact time when was Ramayana introduced to Cambodia is unknown, however, the earliest mentioning of the epic dated to 7th century according to a stone inscription at Veal Kantel, Stueng Treng. Based on the same inscription, the manuscript of this epic already existed in Cambodia as the inscription mentioned the offering of the epic's manuscript to a temple which expressed its importance in Khmer belief. On the other hand, the surviving text of Reamker dated in 16th century. Intricate carvings on the walls of Angkor Wat depict a scene from the Ramayana dating back nearly a millennium. Statues of the poem's heroes were worshiped in temple sanctuaries, akin to the wall paintings at Cambodia's Royal Palace and Wat Bo. The Ramayana has been an important epic in India for at least two thousand years, and Reamker is its Khmer adaptation. The Cambodian version includes incidents and details not found in the Sanskrit original written by the poet Valmiki. An example of a story that does not appear in Indian texts and performance is that of the encounter between Hanuman, the monkey general, and Sovanna Maccha, the mermaid, a favorite of Cambodian audiences.Le Reamker - Description of Ream Ker in French Literary Text of Reamker The exact time or when was Ramaya or Reamker text existed in Cambodia is unknown. However, plenty of art works and inscriptions mentioning the epic were made throughout ancient Cambodia (Funan, Chenla, and Angkor). The earliest evidence regarding the presence of Ramayana text in Cambodia can be found in a 7th century inscription of Veal Kantel (K.359), where it mentioned the offering of Mahabhrata and Ramayana manuscripts to the temple as well as the daily recitation of the texts. The Khmer version of Ramayana bears the name Reamker (Ramakerti)-literally means \\"The Glory of Rama\\". Indeed, the story of Rama is present in both art and literature throughout the history of Cambodia. Cambodian Ramayana contains some incidents that could not find in Valmiki's Ramayana. For instance, the episode of the destruction of Rama's causeway connecting Lanka by fishes and the reconstruction of this causeway as portrayed in a lintel of a Khmer temple at Phimai is believed to have emerged from a local development or the imagination of narrator. However, no literary work prior to 15th century has survived but numerous stone inscriptions or epigraphs have been preserved. From 15th century onward, the story of Rama became an impetus in Khmer literature, mainly in the epic genre, whereby the lengthy poems were composed as recitatives for the masked drama called Khol. Poems narrating the story or the fame of Rama, called Reamker or Ramakerti appeared in the middle period of Khmer History. The surviving literary text of Reamker dated back to 16th century. This Reamker text was composed by at least three unknown authors over centuries and divided into two part. The first part was composed between 16th to 17th century. The earliest writing accounts for about a fifth of the first part, covering the main events of the BƒÅlakƒÅ·πá·∏ça and AyodhyakƒÅ·πá·∏ça. It continued in the 17th century up to the episode where Ravana assembles the remnants of his army for the last battle with Rama. But the episode concerning Ravan's death, the rescue of Sita and her trial by fire, and the triumphant return to Ayodhya are all missing. The second part of Reamker was composed in 18th century deals specifically with the later history of Rama and Sita. This part includes Sita's second rejection and exile, the birth of their two sons, the meeting again, and Sita's going down to the earth. The Reamker differs from the original Ramayana in some ways, featuring additional scenes and emphasis on Hanuman and Sovanna Maccha in which this scene occurs during the construction of causeway connecting Lanka. Reamker is also mentioned in another literature called L'berk Angkor Wat (‚ÄúThe Story of Angkor Wat‚Äù) written in 1620 by Khmer author-Pang Tat (or Nak Pang), celebrating the magnificent temple complex of Angkor Wat and describing the bas-reliefs in the temple galleries that portray the Rama story. In 1900s, Ta Krud and Ta Chak were the two old men famous for their remarkable memory and ability to narrate the whole Reamker story orally and beautifully with gesture. In 1920, Ta Chak found voluminous manuscripts of Reamker story on latanier leaves in a pagoda south of Angkor Wat temple during his monk-hood and he learnt to remember the script by heart. In 1969, Ta Chak's oral narration were recorded and his narration lasted 10 days at the rate of five hours per day. However, he died earlier before he could manage to narrate the remaining episodes. Many versions of Reamker are available in Cambodia. Nowadays, Reamker is considered as Cambodian national epic which plays significant role in Cambodian literature and extends to all Cambodian art forms, from sculpture to dance drama, painting and art. Central plot A scene depicting Indra on his mount, Airavata. The Reamker plot begins with its protagonist, Phreah Ream or Rama, being sent into exile by one of the queen mothers who wanted her own son to inherit the throne. After being sent to the forest, Phreah Ream is joined by his beautiful and faithful wife Neang Seda (Sita), whom the prince won from her father by being the only Prince who successfully completed the father's challenge of firing arrows through a spinning wheel with spokes. Praeh Leak (Lakshmana), the younger brother of Phreah Ream, is concerned about his older brother and joins Neang Seda.The Reamker - an article by Toni Shapiro While entering the forest, Neang Seda and Preah Leak meet the rakshasi Surpanakhar (Surphanakha) who first attempts to seduce Preah Ream, and then Preah Leak. Preah Leak, annoyed by the demon's action, cuts off her ear and nose. The butchered Surpanakhar thirsting for revenge went to her ten-headed brother Krong Reap (Ravana), invincible lord of the island of Lanka. Krong Reap secretly goes to the forest. When he first set eyes on Neang Seda, he was awed by her divine beauty. Krong Reap transforms himself as a golden deer and runs past the party of three. Preah Ream realizes that the deer is not a real deer, however, at Neang Seda's insistence Preah Ream chases it after telling his younger brother to stay and guard his wife. Krong Reap then mimics Preah Ream's voice and calls for his brother to come and save him. Although Preah Leak knows that it is not his brother calling out, he is forced to go at Neang Seda's insistence. However, before he leaves he draws a magical circle around his brother's wife in the dirt that will prevent anything from entering the circle. Krong Reap disguises himself as an old errant and easily tricks Neang Seda's to step outside the circle, after which he abducts her. Preah Ream and Preah Leak return and desperately search for Neang Seda and, in the meantime, they assist the monkey king Sukreep (Sugriva) to destroy his rival Pali Thirat (Vali) and regain his throne. Thanking the two, Sukreep sends the monkey warrior Hanuman to aid them in their search. Hanuman, the son of the wind god, flies out to discover that the demon Krong Reap held Neang Seda prisoner on the island of Lanka.Reamker Epic Legend - a forum post Hanuman order his soldiers to build a bridge of stone to connect the island Lanka to the mainland. While gathering stones, Hanuman realizes that mermaids were stealing stones to prevent the construction of the bridge. He was roused by this and decides to capture the mermaid princess Neang Machha but falls deeply in love with her. The mermaid likewise falls in love, and thus her mermaid army ceases to tamper in Hanuman's business. The bridge built, Preah Ream and Krong Reap face each other in combat. However, Krong Reap quickly regenerates and damage done to him or any body part that is cut off. It is not until one of Krong Reap's generals defects and discloses the secret to slaying the demon - an arrow in the belly button. With Hanuman's aid, they slay the demon. Preah Ream, victorious in his battles, returns to the capital of Ayuthya and ascends the throne. Preah Ream suspects infidelity as his wife was captive of a very smart and manipulative demon. Trust issues between him and his wife Neang Seda arise after his wife draws a picture of Krong Reap at the insistence of her maid servant (as the demon's true face was said to be the ugliest face there was). Fearing her husband's jealousy, Neang Seda puts the picture under the mattress when she is unexpectedly interrupted. Krong Reap's power extends to the picture and that night spikes grow from it and poke Preah Ream through the mattress. He discovers the picture and believes that it confirms his suspicion that his wife succumbed to Krong Reap's persistent attempts to bed her over the years that she was held prisoner. However, Neang Seda had resisted all Krong Reap's attempts, even that in which Krong Reap transformed himself into her husband. Only his scent had given his disguise away. Preah Ream forces his wife to take the trial of fire to prove she is still pure. Neang Seda passes the test. However, Neang Seda is deeply offended by her husband's lack of trust in her and his lack of belief in her word. She decides to leave and find refuge with Valmiki the wiseman, where she gives birth to twin boys. They met their father and he immediately recognizes who they are and takes them to his palace.Reamker - extensive site on the Reamker Characters=Humans= *Preah Ream , is the main protagonist of the epic.

The community is part of the town of South Bruce Peninsula, Ontario. Wiarton is known for the Wiarton Willie Festival, in February each year (starting in 1956), when national and international media cover Wiarton Willie and his Groundhog Day prediction.Your Guide To Wiarton, Wiarton Bruce Peninsula Ontario. In the summer, Wiarton hosts the Bruce Peninsula Multisport Race. History Wiarton was built on lands acquired from the First Nations in the area. It was named after the birthplace of Sir Edmund Head, the Governor General of Canada from 1854 to 1861. In 1880, Wiarton was incorporated as a village, then with a population of 750. By 1894, Wiarton had become an incorporated town. The Government of Ontario has erected two historic plaques in Wiarton, offering a glimpse into the past of this area. The first discusses the fact that the Bruce Peninsula is a barrier to water transportation between Lake Huron and southern Georgian Bay. To avoid a difficult detour to the north, aboriginal peoples developed a portage route across the base of the peninsula. \\"For centuries, the Bruce Peninsula portage was an important link in the Great Lakes transportation network.\\" The second plaque discusses developments in the 1800s, starting with 1855 when \\"a town-plot was laid out here on recently acquired Indian land and named Wiarton, reputedly after the English birthplace of Edmund Head, Governor General of Canada (1854-61)\\". Until 1997, when the service was transferred to Thunder Bay, Ontario, Wiarton was known around Lake Huron and Georgian Bay, as the home of Wiarton Coast Guard Radio, providing continuous weather reports to mariners and residents.North Channel Cruise 1997. In 1999, Wiarton was administratively amalgamated into the new municipality of the Town of South Bruce Peninsula. = Historical timeline, 1850 to 1906 = Although specific dates vary depending on the source, the following are excerpted from a reliable source, History of the County of Bruce, Ontario, Canada, by Norman Robertson, published in 1906. * Mid 1800s: Settlers are arriving and opening businesses. Since there is no wharf for shipping, the community developed on top of the hill, the business centre being at the corner where Gould Street is crossed by Division Street. * 1868: B. B. Miller opens a hotel and post-office; two others open stores. * 1870s: Wharves are constructed and mills erected; many places of business move to Berford Street; by 1879, Gould Street is largely residential. * 1868-70: A steam ship from Collingwood, named the Hero, arrives once or twice a week. By 1869, the steamer Champion makes daily trips to Owen Sound, for improved trade such as the marketing of grain. A dock and warehouse are built. A pharmacy, sawmill and stores open. * 1870: A published directory indicates \\"Population about 200, grain and lumber form the principal trade here. It has a mail four times a week\\". There are two hotels by this time. * 1876: Population is now about 400. A stagecoach is making regular trips to and from Owen Sound. The electric telegraph has reached the town. There is now a grist mill, two steam mills, a planning mill and a tannery. Four churches are holding services. * 1877: A stone school house and two additional churches are built * 1880: Wiarton becomes an incorporated village with a population of 752. * 1882: The railway reaches the village; this will soon make Wiarton into \\"the commercial entrepot for the peninsula\\". * 1891: The old public school building is expanded and made into a high school. * 1893: Wiarton is incorporated into a town, effective the 1st of January 1894. The first mayor is B. B. Millar. * 1900: After council meetings at makeshift premises, a new town hall opens. By now, several large furniture manufacturing facilities, a woolen mill, and a foundry are operating. The Dominion Fish Co. has its central packing plant in Wiarton where some 120,000 pounds of fish are received each week, to be cleaned, frozen, packed and shipped. * 1902-1904: The Wiarton Beet Sugar Manufacturing Company, Limited is built, opens and declares bankruptcy during this time, leaving huge debts. * 1906: Robertson recaps the recent history: \\"Wiarton has made more rapid progress than any other village or town in the county of Bruce. True, it has had its setbacks, such as occurred when the Grand Trunk Railway opened the Owen Sound branch and made that point its principal northern terminus, and again when the sugar refinery failed. Still, it is the busiest town in the county, and the townspeople are hopeful and confident of continued and prolonged prosperity. We trust that these fond hopes may be fully realized.\\" Geography and climate Geographically, the town is defined by the rugged limestone cliffs of the Niagara Escarpment (a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve ‚Äì one of only twelve such reserves in Canada), which bisects the town. The town rests on the picturesque shores of Colpoys Bay, part of Georgian Bay, which is itself part of Lake Huron, one of the Great Lakes. The town has long been known as the gateway to the Bruce Peninsula, the peninsula separating Georgian Bay from the rest of Lake Huron. Wiarton has a warm summer humid continental climate (Dfb under the Koppen Climate Classification) with four distinct seasons. Winters are cold and very snowy with much of it coming from lake effect snow. Because of its location on three sides of water, snowfall totals are very high with an annual average of 404.8 cm. Summers are warm and sunny with a July average of 18.9 degrees Celsius. The average precipitation is 1047.9 mm. Economy Wiarton railway station, 1907 Wiarton's most important businesses were initially founded on the lumber industry. The harvest of timber and the manufacture of goods from lumber were an important industry early in the town's development, until two widespread forest fires, the first in the late 1800s and the later in the early 1900s, wiped out the local forests. The next most important industry was fishing. In 1906, Wiarton was awarded a federal fish hatchery, which helped maintain the fish stock in the area for many years. Fishing was at its peak in the early 20th century, but suffered from the introduction of the invasive sea lamprey to the upper Great Lakes through the Welland Canal in 1921. By 1932, the sea lamprey had arrived in Georgian Bay, and, together with the Great Depression, it brought the decline of the fishing industry. In 1881, the first train arrived in the town as part of Grand Trunk Railway system, for which Wiarton served as its northern terminus, extending to a new wharf in Colpoys Bay constructed in 1882. The last passenger train ran in 1957, when the Canadian government cut back funding on the railways. Freight trains continued using the tracks until 1968, when the lines were abandoned. Tourism as well as stone mining and finishing are now important economic forces in the town. Town services An elected mayor, deputy major and three councilors provide the municipal government for Wiarton and the many small villages and communities that comprise the Town of South Bruce Peninsula. A number of Committees and local Boards assist Council. \\"Council establishes policies and budgets for programs and services delivered by the Town of South Bruce Peninsula.\\" The Legislative Services Department includes the Clerk's Division, By-Law Enforcement and Animal Control, and the Building Division. The Town's Community-Based Strategic Plan, Creating Our Future, was originally completed in 2012 and was updated in 2014 and 2016. The intent is to \\"ensure the protection of the natural resources while balancing the desire for business, tourism and recreational opportunities.\\" The Parks & Recreation Department services parks, playgrounds, athletic fields, ball diamonds, arena, aquatic programs and various programs. The town has Fire stations but policing is provided by the Ontario Provincial Police from the Wiarton Detachment. Tourism Wiarton is best known for being the year-round basecamp of the Bruce Peninsula in \\"Ontario's Natural Retreat.\\" Cottagers, sporting enthusiasts and eco-tourists have historically found their provisions in Wiarton. Another notable feature is the Wiarton Willie Festival and Wiarton Willie, the albino groundhog who purportedly predicts the length of winter every Groundhog Day. Tourism forms an important part of the town's modern economy, attracting many seasonal visitors to the area's cottages and resorts, and to the town's marina.

The Tolka, the second river of Fingal, and Dublin, runs through the centre of the area, meandering to run just north of the village core, and then further north to pass the Connolly Memorial Hospital and then Abbotstown. The Royal Canal and the Dublin-Sligo railway line pass along the southern edge of Blanchardstown proper from east to west. History Blanchardstown was a predominantly rural area, with a small village, in western County Dublin, alongside the neighbouring district of Castleknock. Both areas shared a common history until well into the 19th century, when their development diverged. In the late 1960s, the first housing estates began to be developed. During the 1970s/80s, the village and surrounding housing developments became subsumed into the suburban fabric of Dublin. The Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown (ITB) was established in 1999 and since 2019 is one of the three campuses of the new Technological University Dublin along with Grangegorman and Tallaght campuses. During the late 1990s a criminal gang from Blanchardstown, known as \\"The Westies‚Äù, controlled the heroin trade in west Dublin. One of its leaders was shot in a pub in Blanchardstown in 2003, while others were killed in Spain in 2004. Transport Royal Canal Aqueduct =Rail= There are three Irish Rail train stations in the wider Blanchardstown area: Castleknock, Coolmine and Clonsilla. Trains on the Maynooth/Longford line connect the city centre, at Dublin Connolly, Tara Street and Dublin Pearse stations, to Maynooth, Longford and Sligo. At Clonsilla station, the Dublin‚ÄìNavan railway line connects Docklands railway station to Hansfield and Dunboyne. =Bus= Ballycoolin Industrial Estate is served by a private bus company called AMC Ballycoolin, also known as Express Bus. Bus √âireann services pass through Blanchardstown on Routes 105,109 and 111. Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland routes include 17A, 37, 38, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 39, 39A, 39N, 40D, 70, 76A, 220, 236, 238, 239 and 270. Two Nitelink bus routes also operate on Friday and Saturday nights to Tyrrelstown Route 39N and Dunboyne Route 70N. Express bus routes include service from Aston Quay and from Coolmine Railway Station to Ballycoolin Industrial Estate. Amenities Main entrance to Connolly Hospital Connolly Hospital, one of Dublin's main hospitals, and a public university teaching hospital, is located in the area, as is the Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown. Local retail outlets include Blanchardstown Centre (a large retail shopping centre with over 180 stores), and WestEnd Shopping Park (a retail park located beside the Blanchardstown Centre). The Carlton Hotel, a 4 Star Hotel north-west of the village, is located by the Blanchardstown Centre complex. There is a SuperValu outlet on Main Street. Blanchardstown has a large public library, and is also home to the Dra√≠ocht Arts Centre. There is a large Garda station on Main Street.  Education Technological University Dublin- Blanchardstown campus There are a number of primary schools (national schools) in Blanchardstown, including Scoil Bhr√≠de (Cailin√≠) and Scoil Bhr√≠de (Buacaill√≠) on Church Avenue, Sacred Heart of Jesus Primary School (Huntstown), Scoile Olilibheir (Coolmine), St Ciaran's Primary School (Hartstown), Mary Mother of Hope Primary School (Clonee), and St Phillip the Apostle Primary School (Mountview). Second level schools (secondary schools) serving the area include Blakestown Community School, Riversdale Community College, Hartstown Community School, and Coolmine Community School. The Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown (part of TU Dublin) is a third-level institution with a campus on the Blanchardstown Road. Sport The National Sports Campus is located in Blanchardstown, and includes the National Aquatic Centre (NAC), a major indoor aquatics facility with a 50m swimming pool, diving pool, leisure pool and aquapark, and fitness centre. The centre hosted the Special Olympics World Summer Games in 2003, and a number of international swimming events since then. There are several GAA clubs in the Blanchardstown area, including St. Brigids, Castleknock and St. Peregrines, Clonsilla. There are also a number of association football (soccer) clubs in the area. Religion The former Carmelite Convent (now a business premises) in Blanchardstown St Brigid's Roman Catholic Church is situated behind Main Street at Church Avenue. The foundation stone for the church was laid on 13 October 1835 and the first Mass was celebrated there on 29 October 1837. The construction of the Church and its unusual Flemish spire was finally completed in 1863. In the 19th century, the Roman Catholic parish of Blanchardstown encompassed much of the area now within the Dublin 15 postal district; some of the component areas were quite distinct from Blanchardstown but Catholic parishes had been merged during Penal Laws times. Following the relaxation of the Penal Laws, it became possible for Catholic adherents to consider the construction of additional churches and to repair the existing stock of religious buildings. Church authorities used the opportunity to implement the Tridentine reform which saw the parish as the basic unit of ecclesiastical organisation and the parish priest as the central figure within the parish.Cronin, Elizabeth, Fr Michael Dungan's Blanchardstown, 1836-1968, Four Courts Press (2002), p. 10. The new parish priest of Blanchardstown in 1839, Fr Michael Dungan, oversaw the construction of a number of new churches, which today serve independent parishes, and invited a number of religious communities to provide for the education of Catholic children. St Brigid's Church, Blanchardstown ‚Äì not to be confused with a church of the Church of Ireland in nearby Castleknock ‚Äì was constructed in 1837 upon the foundation of a church that had been built prior to 1731. It is the mother church of 12 other churches constituted out of the parish over the following 156 years.Cronin, Elizabeth, Fr Michael Dungan's Blanchardstown, 1836-1968, Four Courts Press (2002), p 56. * Chapelizod - \\"Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary\\" (separated from Blanchardstown Parish 1883)  Navan Road - \\"Our Lady Help of Christians\\" (separated from Chapelizod 1953) * Castleknock - \\"Our Lady Mother of the Church\\" (separated from Blanchardstown 1976)  Laurel Lodge / Carpenterstown - \\"St Thomas, the Apostle\\" (separated from Castleknock 1983) * Porterstown - \\"St Mochta's\\" (separated from Castleknock 1986.

It was built primarily for the transportation of coal to Grantham. It opened in 1797 and its profitability steadily increased until 1841. It was then sold to a railway company, declined, and was finally closed in 1936. It was used as a water supply for agriculture, and so most of it remained in water after closure, although bridges were lowered. Since the 1970s, the Grantham Canal Society have been working to restore it. Two stretches are now navigable to small vessels. A new route will be required where the canal joins the Trent, as road building has severed the original one. History The concept of a canal from the River Trent to Grantham was first raised on 27 August 1791, as a way of supplying the district with cheaper coal. The intent was for the navigation to join the Trent below Nottingham at Radcliffe-on-Trent. As William Jessop was surveying the Nottingham Canal at the time, he was aked to survey the Grantham route as well, and a bill was put before Parliament in 1792. It was defeated, as there was opposition from coal suppliers, who delivered coal by road to Grantham, and from those who thought that the River Witham would be damaged by the project. A revised route was developed, with the junction now at West Bridgford, and an additional branch to Bingham. A second bill was put forward and the act of Parliament received the Royal Assent on 30 April 1793. Building work on the canal started in 1793, with Jessop in overall charge, but with James Green and William King as resident engineers: Green, who was from Wollaton, was appointed engineer for the section of canal from the Trent to the Leicestershire border, while King, who was the agent for the Duke of Rutland, was responsible for the rest of the canal, including two reservoirs, one at Denton and the other at Knipton on the River Devon. The act authorised an initial ¬£75,000 to be raised to pay for construction, together with an option to raise a further ¬£30,000, of which ¬£20,000 should be raised by shares of ¬£100 each among the initial subscribers, and ¬£10,000 by mortgaging the future income of the canal. However, this amount proved insufficient, and there was also disagreement between the shareholders as to their liability to raise the additional ¬£20,000. As a result, a second act was sought. This received the Royal Assent on 3 March 1797, and made clear the obligations of existing shareholders to pay the extra subscription, and also authorised an additional ¬£24,000 to be raised. The second act also removed restrictions in the first act, and allowed the company to set whatever rates it chose for using the canal. The eastern section from the Leicestershire border was opened on 1 February 1797, with the rest of the canal later that year. The canal was built with locks , the same size as those on the Nottingham Canal to allow boats to use both. The branch to Bingham authorised by the first act was not built. The 18 locks raised the level of the canal by from the Trent to Grantham. Eleven of them were located in the first above the Trent, after which there was a level pound of around before a flight of seven locks at Woolsthorpe, and a much shorter upper pound to Grantham. At Harlaxton, the canal passed through a deep cutting (effectively crossing the watershed between the River Witham and the River Trent), which was only wide enough for a single boat, but this situation was partially rectified in 1801 when the cutting was widened in two places to allow boats travelling on opposite directions to cross. At Cropwell Bishop and Cropwell Butler, the route passed through gypsum beds, which resulted in problems with leakage. =Operation= The canal made sufficient money to repay substantial debts in 1804 and 1805, after which dividends were paid to the shareholders, beginning at 2 per cent in 1806, rising to 5 per cent in 1815, and reaching their highest level of 8.6 per cent in 1839. The tolls brought in an income which remained below ¬£9,000 until 1823, but then rose steadily to reach ¬£13,079 in 1841. Traffic towards Grantham included coal and coke, lime, groceries and building materials. Some of it supplied villages along the line of the canal, and some of that which travelled the full distance was distributed by land to villages beyond Grantham. Downward traffic was largely agricultural produce, including corn, beans, malt and wool. Such produce was normally loaded at Grantham or Harby. Initially, some of the coal carried on the canal had been transported in boats owned by the canal company, but they had given up this practice in 1812. They resumed carrying coal in 1827, because they felt that coal stocks at Grantham were not adequate, but were accused of price-fixing. Although the penalty imposed by Lincoln Assizes was small, they ceased this trade, and the coal merchants agreed to maintain stocks of 2,660 tons at Grantham. In 1833, J. Rofe and his son made a proposal for a canal to connect Grantham and Sleaford, but this was not pursued. =Decline= In common with most canals, competition from railways posed a major threat, and in 1845 the canal owners agreed to sell it to the Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway when their line from Ambergate to Grantham was opened. Although the railway was completed in 1850, the railway company did not honour the agreement. The canal company brought a large number of cases against the railway company, and successfully opposed several bills which the railway were trying to get passed in Parliament. Eventually the railway company agreed to pay, and shareholders received ¬£45 per share in cash, with the balance being in railway mortgages. The agreement was reached on 1 June 1854, and the transfer of ownership took place on 20 December. Railway mergers meant that the canal came under the control of the Great Northern Railway in 1861, and later the London and North Eastern Railway. Traffic declined as the railway companies neglected the canal, and were down to 18,802 tons in 1905, on which the tolls amounted to ¬£242 and an Act of Parliament was passed in 1936, formally closing the canal, though there had been no boat traffic since 1929. The closure act stipulated that water levels should be maintained at to support agricultural needs. This effectively guaranteed the continued existence of the canal channel, but structures such as locks and bridges deteriorated, and in the 1950s 46 of the 69 bridges over the canal were lowered as part of road improvement schemes. Although the low bridges act as barriers to navigation, large parts of the canal are still in water. In 1948 Britain's railways, and hence the canal, were nationalised, and became the responsibility of the British Transport Commission. In 1963 control of the canal passed to British Waterways. Under the terms of the Transport Act 1968, all waterways within the jurisdiction of British Waterways were classified as commercial, cruising or remainder waterways. Remainder waterways were those that were deemed to have no economic future, and maintenance would only be carried out where failure to do so would create health or safety issues. The Grantham Canal was listed in this latter category. Restoration The \\"Dirty Duck\\" at Woolsthorpe viewed through bridge 61 Woolsthorpe Bottom Lock A plan to fill in a section of the canal in Nottingham resulted in a number of letters appearing in the local press in 1963, and a student at Kesteven College produced a report on the state of the canal, which was presented to the Grantham Civic Society. In 1970, the British Waterways Board attempted to obtain an act of parliament which would have allowed them to cease maintaining the water levels of the canal. The Inland Waterways Association campaigned against the bill, and the clause was amended. The Grantham Canal Society was formed soon afterwards, to promote restoration of the waterway. In 1974, a National Boat Rally was held at Nottingham, to gain support for the restoration scheme, and to promote the idea of a new link to the Trent, which would pass through old gravel workings. Together with British Waterways, the Inland Waterways Association and the Waterway Recovery Group, the Society began the work of restoration of the canal to navigation, a process which is still ongoing. A major development was the granting of permission in 1992 to remove an old railway embankment, which blocked the route near the top of the Woolsthorpe flight of locks. The task was completed by a number of Waterway Recovery Group workcamps. New gates were fitted to the top three locks, and rebuilding of Casthorpe bridge was funded by Lincolnshire County Council, opening up of the canal for navigation. Further down the canal, restoration of a section between Hickling Basin and Hose was funded by a derelict land grant of ¬£400,000, received in 1993. The Grantham Canal Partnership was formed in 1997, as a way to take the project forwards. It consisted of representatives from each of the six local authorities through which the route passes, British Waterways, the Inland Waterways Association, the Grantham Canal Restoration Society and the Grantham Navigation Association, a group which had split off from the Canal Society in 1992. As a result of the co-operation, British Waterways formulated a draft business plan for the canal. Following the restoration of the top three locks at Woolsthorpe in the 1990s, a 10-mile (16-km) section from the A1 to Redmile will be completed once the bottom four locks of the flight are restored. The rebuilding of locks 6 and 7, completed in 2000, brought the number of locks restored to five, and approximately one quarter of the canal has been restored to navigable standard. Much improvement of the towpath has also taken place, and access to it is possible at most of the bridges. A major setback occurred in 2007, when one of the walls of Woolsthorpe top lock had to be propped to prevent it collapsing, and British Waterways took the decision to fill it in, as funding was not available to rebuild it. The Inland Waterways Association received a legacy of ¬£100,000 from the estate of Fredrick Woodman, designated for the Grantham Canal, but British Waterways ruled that no work could start until the whole cost of ¬£175,000 had been found. The balance was made up by grants of ¬£40,000 from Lincolnshire County Council and ¬£35,000 from the East Midlands Development Agency. The wall was demolished and rebuilt in three sections, utilizing of concrete and 7,500 new bricks. A dry section of the canal near Cropwell Bishop Restoration of most of the canal does not present major problems, but challenges are presented by the final sections at both ends. The original route to join the Trent has been severed by the building of the A52 road. A route was identified which followed the course of the Polser Brook, which passes under the A52 to the north of the canal, but by 2009, three possible solutions were under consideration. These pose additional problems in finding funding, since they do not count as restoration, and many of the traditional funding sources are not then available. At Grantham, an embankment carrying the A1 road blocks the line of the canal, and the terminal basin has been filled in. There are plans for a tunnel under the A1 as part of a cycle route to improve access to Grantham, and the basin could be redeveloped in due course. There is also a dry section between Cotgrave and Kinoulton, which has presented problems since construction in the 18th century: gypsum in the soil reacted with the waterproof clay leading to leaking. In early 2005, the Grantham Canal Partnership appointed a full-time Grantham Canal restoration manager, Kevin Mann, for an initial 18-month trial period. He would be responsible for planning and managing funding schemes for the restoration, identifying development opportunities and the promotion and interpretation of the canal. The trial proved to be successful, as he was still doing the job in 2009. The canal and its banks between Redmile and Harby is designated a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest as Grantham Canal SSSI. Points of interestBelvoir tramway The line of the Belvoir tramway The Duke of Rutland also constructed a private wagonway or tramway between the wharf at Muston Gorse and Belvoir Castle. It was constructed in 1814/15, and remained operational for 100 years. It was constructed with fish-belly rail set into stone chairs, some of which, and some wagons, still exist in the castle cellars. The gauge was , and the rails were supplied by The Butterley Company. Some are in the collection of the science museum, and the National Railway Museum where there is the chassis of one of the wagons.

The input to \`eval\` is not necessarily a string; it may be structured representation of code, such as an abstract syntax tree (like Lisp forms), or of special type such as \`code\` (as in Python). The analog for a statement is \`exec\`, which executes a string (or code in other format) as if it were a statement; in some languages, such as Python, both are present, while in other languages only one of either \`eval\` or \`exec\` is. Eval and apply are instances of meta-circular evaluators, interpreters of a language that can be invoked within the language itself.  Security risks  Using \`eval\` with data from an untrusted source may introduce security vulnerabilities. For instance, assuming that the \`get_data()\` function gets data from the Internet, this Python code is insecure: session['authenticated'] = False data = get_data() foo = eval(data) An attacker could supply the program with the string \`\\"session.update(authenticated=True)\\"\` as data, which would update the \`session\` dictionary to set an authenticated key to be True. To remedy this, all data which will be used with \`eval\` must be escaped, or it must be run without access to potentially harmful functions.  Implementation  In interpreted languages, \`eval\` is almost always implemented with the same interpreter as normal code. In compiled languages, the same compiler used to compile programs may be embedded in programs using the \`eval\` function; separate interpreters are sometimes used, though this results in code duplication.  Programming languages = ECMAScript = JavaScript  In JavaScript, \`eval\` is something of a hybrid between an expression evaluator and a statement executor. It returns the result of the last expression evaluated. Example as an expression evaluator: foo = 2; alert(eval('foo + 2')); Example as a statement executor: foo = 2; eval('foo = foo + 2;alert(foo);'); One use of JavaScript's \`eval\` is to parse JSON text, perhaps as part of an Ajax framework. However, modern browsers provide \`JSON.parse\` as a more secure alternative for this task.  ActionScript  In ActionScript (Flash's programming language), \`eval\` cannot be used to evaluate arbitrary expressions. According to the Flash 8 documentation, its usage is limited to expressions which represent \\"the name of a variable, property, object, or movie clip to retrieve. This parameter can be either a String or a direct reference to the object instance.\\" ActionScript 3 does not support eval. The ActionScript 3 Eval LibraryActionScript 3 Eval Library and the D.eval API are ongoing development projects to create equivalents to \`eval\` in ActionScript 3. = Lisp = Lisp was the original language to make use of an \`eval\` function in 1958. In fact, definition of the \`eval\` function led to the first implementation of the language interpreter.John McCarthy, \\"History of Lisp - The Implementation of Lisp\\" Before the \`eval\` function was defined, Lisp functions were manually compiled to assembly language statements. However, once the \`eval\` function had been manually compiled it was then used as part of a simple read-eval-print loop which formed the basis of the first Lisp interpreter. Later versions of the Lisp \`eval\` function have also been implemented as compilers. The \`eval\` function in Lisp expects a form to be evaluated and executed as argument. The return value of the given form will be the return value of the call to \`eval\`. This is an example Lisp code: ; A form which calls the + function with 1,2 and 3 as arguments. ; It returns 6. (+ 1 2 3) ; In lisp any form is meant to be evaluated, therefore ; the call to + was performed. ; We can prevent Lisp from performing evaluation ; of a form by prefixing it with \\"'\\", for example: (setq form1 '(+ 1 2 3)) ; Now form1 contains a form that can be used by eval, for ; example: (eval form1) ; eval evaluated (+ 1 2 3) and returned 6. Lisp is well known to be very flexible and so is the \`eval\` function. For example, to evaluate the content of a string, the string would first have to be converted into a Lisp form using the \`read-from-string\` function and then the resulting form would have to be passed to \`eval\`: (eval (read-from-string \\"(format t \\\\\\"Hello World!!!~%\\\\\\")\\")) One major point of confusion is the question, in which context the symbols in the form will be evaluated. In the above example, \`form1\` contains the symbol \`+\`. Evaluation of this symbol must yield the function for addition to make the example work as intended. Thus some dialects of lisp allow an additional parameter for \`eval\` to specify the context of evaluation (similar to the optional arguments to Python's \`eval\` function - see below). An example in the Scheme dialect of Lisp (R5RS and later): ;; Define some simple form as in the above example. (define form2 '(+ 5 2)) ;Value: form2 ;; Evaluate the form within the initial context. ;; A context for evaluation is called an \\"environment\\" in Scheme slang. (eval form2 user- initial-environment) ;Value: 7 ;; Confuse the initial environment, so that + will be ;; a name for the subtraction function. (environment-define user- initial-environment '+ -) ;Value: + ;; Evaluate the form again. ;; Notice that the returned value has changed. (eval form2 user-initial-environment) ;Value: 3 = Perl = In Perl, the \`eval\` function is something of a hybrid between an expression evaluator and a statement executor. It returns the result of the last expression evaluated (all statements are expressions in Perl programming), and allows the final semicolon to be left off. Example as an expression evaluator: $foo = 2; print eval('$foo + 2'), \\" \\"; Example as a statement executor: $foo = 2; eval('$foo += 2; print \\"$foo \\";'); Perl also has \`eval\` blocks, which serves as its exception handling mechanism (see Exception handling syntax#Perl). This differs from the above use of \`eval\` with strings in that code inside \`eval\` blocks is interpreted at compile-time instead of run-time, so it is not the meaning of \`eval\` used in this article. = PHP = In PHP, \`eval\` executes code in a string almost exactly as if it had been put in the file instead of the call to \`eval()\`. The only exception is that errors are reported as coming from a call to \`eval()\`, and return statements become the result of the function. Unlike some languages, the argument to \`eval\` must be a string of one or more complete statements, not just expressions; however, one can get the \\"expression\\" form of \`eval\` by putting the expression in a return statement, which causes \`eval\` to return the result of that expression. Unlike some languages, PHP's \`eval\` is a \\"language construct\\" rather than a function, and so cannot be used in some contexts where functions can be, like higher-order functions. Example using echo: Example returning a value: =Lua= In Lua 5.1, \`loadstring\` compiles Lua code into an anonymous function. Example as an expression evaluator: loadstring(\\"print('Hello World!')\\")() Example to do the evaluation in two steps: a = 1 f = loadstring(\\"return a + 1\\")  compile the expression to an anonymous function print(f())  execute (and print the result '2') Lua 5.2 deprecates \`loadstring\` in favor of the existing \`load\` function, which has been augmented to accept strings. In addition, it allows providing the function's environment directly, as environments are now upvalues. print(load(\\"print('Hello ' .. a)\\", \\"\\", \\"t\\", { a = \\"World!\\", print = print })()) = PostScript = PostScript's \`exec\` operator takes an operand ‚Äî if it is a simple literal it pushes it back on the stack. If one takes a string containing a PostScript expression however, one can convert the string to an executable which then can be executed by the interpreter, for example: (Hello World) = which pops the string \\"Hello World\\" off the stack and displays it on the screen, to have an executable type, then is executed. PostScript's \`run\` operator is similar in functionality but instead the interpreter interprets PostScript expressions in a file, itself. >>> x = 1 >>> eval('x + 1') 2 >>> eval('x') 1 The \`eval\` function takes two optional arguments, \`global\` and \`locals\`, which allow the programmer to set up a restricted environment for the evaluation of the expression. The \`exec\` statement (or the \`exec\` function in Python 3.x) executes statements: \`exec\` example (interactive shell): >>> x = 1 >>> y = 1 >>> exec \\"x += 1; y -= 1\\" >>> x 2 >>> y 0 The most general form for evaluating statements/expressions is using code objects. Those can be created by invoking the \`compile()\` function and by telling it what kind of input it has to compile: an \\"\`exec\`\\" statement, an \\"\`eval\`\\" statement or a \\"\`single\`\\" statement: \`compile\` example (interactive shell): >>> x = 1 >>> y = 2 >>> eval (compile (\\"print 'x + y = ', x + y\\", \\"compile-sample.py\\", \\"single\\")) x + y = 3 = D = D is a statically compiled language and therefore does not include an \\"\`eval\`\\" statement in the traditional sense, but does include the related \\"\`mixin\`\\" statement. The difference is that, where \\"\`eval\`\\" interprets a string as code at runtime, with a \\"\`mixin\`\\" the string is statically compiled like ordinary code and must be known at compile time. For example: import std.stdio; void main() { int num = 0; mixin(\\"num++;\\"); writeln(num); // Prints 1. } The above example will compile to exactly the same assembly language instructions as if \\"\`num++;\`\\" had been written directly instead of mixed in. The argument to mixin doesn't need to be a string literal, but arbitrary expressions resulting in a string value, including function calls, that can be evaluated at compile time. = ColdFusion = ColdFusion's \`evaluate\` function lets you evaluate a string expression at runtime. It is particularly useful when you need to programatically choose the variable you want to read from. = Ruby = The Ruby programming language interpreter offers an \`eval\` function similar to Python or Perl, and also allows a scope, or binding, to be specified. Aside from specifying a function's binding, \`eval\` may also be used to evaluate an expression within a specific class definition binding or object instance binding, allowing classes to be extended with new methods specified in strings. a = 1 eval('a + 1') # (evaluates to 2) # evaluating within a context def get_binding(a) binding end eval('a+1',get_binding(3)) # (evaluates to 4, because 'a' in the context of get_binding is 3) class Test; end Test.class_eval(\\"def hello; return 'hello';end\\") # add a method 'hello' to this class Test.new.hello # evaluates to \\"hello\\" = Forth = Most standard implementations of Forth have two variants of \`eval\`: \`EVALUATE\` and \`INTERPRET\`. Win32FORTH code example: S\\" 2 2 + .\\" EVALUATE \\\\ Outputs \\"4\\" = BASIC = REALbasic  In REALbasic, there is a class called RBScript which can execute REALbasic code at runtime. RBScript is very sandboxed‚Äîonly the most core language features are there, and you have to allow it access to things you want it to have. You can optionally assign an object to the context property. This allows for the code in RBScript to call functions and use properties of the context object. However, it is still limited to only understanding the most basic types, so if you have a function that returns a Dictionary or MySpiffyObject, RBScript will be unable to use it. You can also communicate with your RBScript through the Print and Input events.  VBScript  Microsoft's VBScript, which is an interpreted language, has two constructs. \`Eval\` is a function evaluator that can include calls to user-defined functions. (These functions may have side-effects such as changing the values of global variables.) \`Execute\` executes one or more colon-separated statements, which can change global state. Both VBScript and JScript \`eval\` are available to developers of compiled Windows applications (written in languages which do not support Eval) through an ActiveX control called the Microsoft Script Control, whose Eval method can be called by application code. To support calling of user-defined functions, one must first initialize the control with the AddCode method, which loads a string (or a string resource) containing a library of user-defined functions defined in the language of one's choice, prior to calling Eval. Visual Basic for Applications Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), the programming language of Microsoft Office, is a virtual machine language where the runtime environment compiles and runs p-code. Its flavor of Eval supports only expression evaluation, where the expression may include user-defined functions and objects (but not user-defined variable names). Of note, the evaluator is different from VBS, and invocation of certain user-defined functions may work differently in VBA than the identical code in VBScript. = Smalltalk = As Smalltalk's compiler classes are part of the standard class library and usually present at run time, these can be used to evaluate a code string. Compiler evaluate:'1 + 2' Because class and method definitions are also implemented by message-sends (to class objects), even code changes are possible: Compiler evaluate:'Object subclass:#Foo' = Tcl = The Tcl programming language has a command called \`eval\`, which executes the source code provided as an argument. Tcl represents all source code as strings, with curly braces acting as quotation marks, so that the argument to \`eval\` can have the same formatting as any other source code. set foo { while {[incr i]<10} { puts \\"$i squared is [expr $i*$i]\\" } } eval $foo = bs = bs has an \`eval\` function that takes one string argument. The function is both an expression evaluator and a statement executor. In the latter role, it can also be used for error handling. The following examples and text are from the \`bs\` man page as appears in the UNIX System V Release 3.2 Programmer's Manual.  Command-line interpreters = Unix shells = The eval command is present in all Unix shells, including the original \\"sh\\" (Bourne shell). It concatenates all the arguments with spaces, then re-parses and executes the result as a command. = Windows PowerShell = In Windows PowerShell, the \`Invoke-Expression\` Cmdlet serves the same purpose as the eval function in programming languages like JavaScript, PHP and Python. The Cmdlet runs any Windows PowerShell expression that is provided as a command parameter in the form of a string and outputs the result of the specified expression. Usually, the output of the Cmdlet is of the same type as the result of executing the expression. However, if the result is an empty array, it outputs \`$null\`. In case the result is a single-element array, it outputs that single element. Similar to JavaScript, Windows PowerShell allows the final semicolon to be left off. Example as an expression evaluator: PS > $foo = 2 PS > invoke- expression '$foo + 2' Example as a statement executor: PS > $foo = 2 PS > invoke-expression '$foo += 2; $foo' Microcode In 1966 IBM Conversational Programming System (CPS) introduced a microprogrammed function \`EVAL\` to perform \\"interpretive evaluation of expressions which are written in a modified Polish-string notation\\" on an IBM System/360 Model 50. Microcoding this function was \\"substantially more\\" than five times faster compared to a program that interpreted an assignment statement. Theory In theoretical computer science, a careful distinction is commonly made between eval and apply. Eval is understood to be the step of converting a quoted string into a callable function and its arguments, whereas apply is the actual call of the function with a given set of arguments. The distinction is particularly noticeable in functional languages, and languages based on lambda calculus, such as LISP and Scheme. Thus, for example, in Scheme, the distinction is between (eval '(f x) ) where the form (f x) is to be evaluated, and (apply f (list x)) where the function f is to be called with argument x. Eval and apply are the two interdependent components of the eval-apply cycle, which is the essence of evaluating Lisp, described in SICP.The Metacircular Evaluator (SICP Section 4.1) In category theory, the eval morphism is used to define the closed monoidal category. Thus, for example, the category of sets, with functions taken as morphisms, and the cartesian product taken as the product, forms a Cartesian closed category. Here, eval (or, properly speaking, apply) together with its right adjoint, currying, form the simply typed lambda calculus, which can be interpreted to be the morphisms of Cartesian closed categories.

During the war, he was one of the youngest major generals in the Army and fought numerous major battles in the Eastern Theater and in Georgia and the Carolinas. While commanding a regiment, a brigade, a division, and a corps in the Army of the Potomac, he saw action at First Bull Run, the Peninsula Campaign, South Mountain, Antietam, Chancellorsville, and Harpers' Ferry. At Gettysburg, he was the senior Union General in the Field, under Gen. George G. Meade. During the battle, he held the Union right from Culp's Hill to across the Baltimore Pike. His successful defense of Culp's Hill was crucial to the Union victory at Gettysburg. After the fall of Vicksburg on the Mississippi River, splitting the southern Confederacy, Slocum was appointed military commander of the district. Slocum participated in the Atlanta Campaign and was the first commander to enter the city on September 2, 1864. He then served as occupation commander of Atlanta. Slocum was appointed the commander of the left wing of Gen. William T. Sherman's famous \\"March to the Sea\\" to Savannah on the Atlantic coast through Georgia and afterwards turning north through the Carolinas, commanding the XIV and XX Corps, comprising the Army of Georgia. During this campaign, he captured the then state capital of Georgia, Milledgeville and the Atlantic coast seaport of Savannah. In the Carolinas campaign, Slocum's army saw victories in the battles of Averasborough and Bentonville, North Carolina. The \\"March to the Sea\\" and the Carolinas campaign were crucial to the overall Union victory in the Civil War. After the surrender of Confederate forces, Slocum was given command of the Department of Mississippi. Slocum declined an officer's appointment in the postwar Regular Army. He was a successful political leader in the North, a businessman and railroad developer. Early life and career Slocum was born in Delphi Falls, a hamlet in Onondaga County, New York. His father was Matthew B. Slocum, and his mother was Mary Ostrander. He was the sixth of eleven children. He attended the State Normal School in Albany and the Cazenovia Seminary in Madison County. At the age of 16, he received a Public School Teacher's Certificate from the County Superintendent of Schools, and worked occasionally as a teacher for the next five years.Slocum, Charles E. The Life and Services of Major-General Henry Warner Slocum. Toledo: Slocum Publishing, 1913, p. 8. On the recommendation of Congressman Daniel F. Gott (Onondaga, New York), Slocum obtained an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1848, where he did well academically, graduating seventh of 43 in the class of 1852. He tutored his roommate, cadet Philip Sheridan, in mathematics. In his memoirs, Sheridan credited Slocum with helping him pass his examination and graduate from the academy. While at West Point, Slocum expressed opposition to slavery, which was an unpopular position since many of the cadets were from the South.Address of General O. O. Howard before Rankin Post, Grand Army of the Republic, Brooklyn, April 29, 1894. Slocum was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Artillery on July 1, 1852. He served in the Seminole War in Florida and at Fort Moultrie in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. While stationed there, he went on leave to marry Clara Rice in 1854.Brown, pp. 1801‚Äì02. They had four children. Slocum was promoted to first lieutenant on March 3, 1855. He resigned his commission October 31, 1856, and settled in Syracuse, New York.Eicher, p. 491. While serving in the army, Slocum studied law under B. C. Presley, who was later elected Supreme Court Justice of South Carolina. Slocum was admitted to the bar in 1858 and practiced in Syracuse. He served as the county treasurer and was a member of the New York State Assembly (Onondaga Co., 2nd D.) in 1859. During this period he also served as an artillery instructor in the New York Militia with the rank of colonel.Warner, pp. 451‚Äì53. Civil War=Early commands= At the outbreak of the Civil War, Slocum was appointed colonel of the 27th New York Infantry, which was a two-year regiment mustered in at Elmira, New York. He led the regiment at First Bull Run, where it was in the thick of the fighting, losing 130 men. Slocum himself was badly wounded, and after recuperating, he got command of a brigade in General William B. Franklin's division in the Army of the Potomac. When Franklin became commander of the new VI Corps in May 1862, Slocum took over command of the division, leading it with distinction during the Seven Days Battles.Tagg, pp. 143‚Äì46. General Fitz-John Porter complimented Slocum's division in the Virginia campaigns as \\"one of the best divisions in the Army.\\" On July 25, 1862, Slocum was promoted to major general of volunteers to rank from July 4, the second youngest man in the Army to achieve that rank. The VI Corps stayed in Washington D.C. during the Northern Virginia Campaign, although one of Slocum's brigades was sent down to Bull Run and attacked and routed by the Confederates on August 26. At Crampton's Gap during the Battle of South Mountain on September 14, 1862, Slocum assaulted the enemy line behind a stone wall and routed it. Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin, corps commander, described the victory as \\"the completest victory gained up to that time by any part of the Army of the Potomac.\\" At Antietam, Slocum's division was not significantly engaged. The following month, he was named permanent commander of the XII Corps, which had lost its commander, General Joseph K. Mansfield at Antietam. During the Fredericksburg Campaign, Slocum and the XII Corps were stationed around Harper's Ferry and had no involvement in the Battle of Fredericksburg. At the Battle of Chancellorsville on May 1‚Äì5, 1863, Slocum commanded the Union right wing, including the XII Corps and the V Corps of Maj. Gen. George G. Meade and the XI Corps of Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard, a combined force of 46,000 men. Slocum executed well and maneuvered his wing into the rear of Gen. Robert E. Lee's army, halting the Confederate advance. When Joe Hooker was removed from command of the army on June 28, Slocum, as the ranking corps commander, would normally be in line to succeed him, but the War Department instead appointed George Meade as army commander, apparently feeling that he was a more aggressive fighter. Slocum graciously consented to serving under Meade, his junior in rank. =Gettysburg= equestrian statue of Slocum by Frederick William MacMonnies in Brooklyn's Prospect Park. Maj. Gen. Slocum played a decisive role in the Union victory at the Battle of Gettysburg, July 1‚Äì3, 1863. His XII Corps troops' defense of Culp's Hill on the Union right is credited with ensuring Meade's ultimate victory against Lee's army. Despite this, some modern historians of Gettysburg have questioned the actions of Slocum on the afternoon of July 1, 1863. They allege that he failed to come to the immediate aid of General Howard's XI Corps and engage Confederate troops in a timely way at Gettysburg. Information from recently accessed records, however, including Gen. Meade's archives, shows that Slocum, in fact, dispatched the First Division of his Corps to Gettysburg immediately upon hearing the first report of the fighting. Further, Gen. Slocum's First Division commander, Brig. Gen. Alpheus S. Williams, verified this as he reported in late 1865 that \\"when reports of the battle going on in advance of Gettysburg were brought to Gen. Slocum ... orders were issued to put the corps in motion,\\" and the \\"corps was immediately put in rapid march toward the scene.\\" A report by Maj. Guindon, whom Slocum had sent on a reconnaissance mission, corroborates Williams' report; Maj. Guindon indicated that Slocum moved out troops even before he received a request for aid from Gen. Howard. Furthermore, Slocum advanced his First Division despite an order (known as the \\"Pipe Creek Circular\\") issued by General Meade that morning, and received by Slocum at 1:30 pm, to \\"halt your command where this order reaches you.\\" Contrary to modern interpretation, Slocum's actions in fact showed initiative. Slocum arrived at the battlefield marching from Two Taverns on the Baltimore Pike, about 5 miles southeast of the battlefield, late in the afternoon on July 1, 1863. As the ranking general on the field, Slocum commanded the Union army for about six hours, until Meade arrived after midnight. During this time, Slocum was responsible for the supervision of the formation of the Union defensive lines. For the duration of the battle, Slocum would command the Union line from the \\"point of the fish hook\\" from Culp's Hill to the south. Slocum's XII Corps would successfully defend Culp's Hill for three days, denying a Confederate victory at this most crucial of battles. During the battle of Culp's Hill, in addition to his own XII Corps, Slocum commanded elements of the I, VI and XI Corps. Leister house in Gettysburg On July 2 at midnight, Gen. Meade called for a council of war with his corps commanders. It was held at his field headquarters in the front room of the Leister house. He asked his commanders whether the Union Army should remain in its present position, or to retire to another position nearer its base of supplies. Further, if the Army remained in its present position, should it attack or await the attack of the enemy. It is then that Slocum gave his recommendation to \\"Stay and fight it out.\\"Gibbon, John, Major General, U.S.V. \\"The Council of War on the Second Day,\\" In Battles and Leaders of the Civil War, p. 313-314. New York: Century Company, 1884, 1888. Meade planned an attack from the Power's Hill area into the Confederate left flank, to be led by Slocum the following day, utilizing the V Corps and the XII Corps as the army's \\"right wing.\\" Slocum reported to Meade that he believed the plan was not feasible, as the terrain was too difficult for an assault. General Gouvernor K. Warren agreed with Slocum's assessment. When Meade ordered Slocum to send the entire XII Corps to assist the defense against Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's assault on the Union left flank on July 2, Slocum wisely recommended holding one brigade back in its position on Culp's Hill. This brigade, under Brig. Gen. George S. Greene, was able to hold out against a massive Confederate assault and saved the critical hill for the Union. This brigade was composed of five regiments of infantry, of only 1,350 soldiers. The regiments were: the 60th New York, Colonel Abel Godard; the 78th New York, Colonel Herbert von Hammerstein; the 102nd New York, Colonel Lewis R. Stegman; the 137th New York, Colonel David Ireland; and the 149th New York, Colonel Henry A. Barnum.Greene, George S., \\"The breastworks at Culp's Hill, II.\\" In Battles and Leaders of the Civil War, Vol. 3, Century Magazine, 1887, 317. General Greene later wrote in an article for Century Magazine, \\"To the discernment of General Slocum who saw the danger to which the army would exposed by the movement ordered by Meade to deplete the right wing the afternoon of July 2, and who took the responsibility of modifying the orders which he had received from Meade is due the honor of having saved the army from a great and perhaps fatal disaster.\\"Greene, George S., \\"The breastworks at Culp's Hill, II.\\" In Battles and Leaders of the Civil War, Vol. 3, Century Magazine, 1887, 317. General Oliver O. Howard later recalled of Slocum's troops and the defense of Culp's Hill: \\"The fighting at Culp's Hill was the most impressive incident of the Battle of Gettysburg ... a step all-important and essential to victory ... Slocum ... prevented Meade from losing the Battle of Gettysburg.\\"Howard, Oliver O. \\"To the Memory of Henry Slocum: A Eulogy by Oliver O. Howard.\\" In Civil War Times Illustrated, ed. Thomas E. Hilton, 21, March 1982, 38-41. Slocum's XII Corps received no medals of honor for the defense of Culp's Hill and the Union right wing.\\" =Western Theater= During the autumn of 1863, Slocum was transferred with his corps to the Western Theater. When he learned that he would have to serve under Joe Hooker, Slocum, who had disliked Hooker since Chancellorsville, wrote to President Lincoln saying that he would rather resign from the Army. Lincoln assured him that he would not actually have to serve under Hooker and a compromise was reached whereby one division of the corps, under Slocum, was assigned to protect the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad while the other division served directly under Hooker. During the summer of 1864, Slocum commanded the District of Vicksburg and the XVII Corps of the Department of the Tennessee. Slocum's administration of the district of Vicksburg was so efficient and successful that attempts to transfer Slocum to a fighting command in Georgia were prevented by Union Army commander General Ulysses S. Grant. When Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson was killed in action during the Atlanta Campaign, command of Army of the Tennessee opened up, and when Hooker did not get it he resigned his commission. Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman appointed Slocum to command the new XX Corps, which had been formed by merging the XI Corps and XII Corps into a single command. His former XII Corps soldiers cheered their previous commander's return. When Atlanta fell to Sherman on September 2, 1864, Gen. Slocum and his corps were the first to enter the city. Slocum was occupation commander of Atlanta for ten weeks, during which time he tried to make the occupation as tolerable for civilians as he could. Slocum wrote to his wife in a letter on November 7, 1864: \\"I wish for humanity's sake that this sad war could be brought to a close. While laboring to make it successful, I shall do all in my power to mitigate its horrors.\\" At the start of the Franklin- Nashville Campaign, Sherman left Slocum in command of 12,000 troops in Atlanta as Sherman pursued Confederate Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood and his army. = March to the Sea - Savannah Campaign = One of General Slocum's most important commands was that of the Army of Georgia, which participated in the famous March to the Sea. Slocum and his Army of Georgia participated in all engagements from the beginning of the March on November 16 until the surrender of the Confederate forces of General Joseph E. Johnston. General William Tecumseh Sherman's March to the Sea, also called the Savannah Campaign, was among the most effective campaigns of the Civil War. The plan was conceived by Sherman himself, and approved by General Ulysses S. Grant and President Abraham Lincoln. Sherman's objective was to divide the Confederacy in two along a West to East path following its strategic rail lines. Sherman's Army would exchange its inland base of Atlanta for the more secure base (Savannah) on the Atlantic coast, which was controlled by the Union Navy. Disrupt the Southern economy by limiting access to vast food stores, manufacturing and destroying their rail and communication systems. Further it would demonstrate that Southern Army could not defend their heartland. The campaign would prevent reinforcing of Lee's troops defending Petersburg, Virginia, and the Confederate capital of Richmond. Sherman's Savannah campaign was considered a major Union success. Historians have stated that this was a major contribution to the overall Union victory in the war. The March was considered revolutionary, and in some ways unique, in the annals of modern warfare. Sherman's Army was composed of two armies, called wings, and a cavalry division. During the March, they followed separate paths along four parallel routes, 20‚Äì60 miles apart. Columns of men could stretch up to 50 miles long. Wagon columns could stretch up to 30 miles. The right wing (southern column; Army of the Tennessee) marched along the Georgia railroad, the Macon and Western railroad. The left wing (northern column; Army of Georgia) marched following the Georgia railroad, feinting toward Augusta. Sherman's plan was to confuse the Confederate Army as to his objectives. The city he was heading for was Milledgeville, the Georgia state capital, which was captured on November 22, 1864. The ultimate objective of the March was the port city of Savannah, which was captured and occupied on December 21, 1864. Sherman later placed Slocum in command of the newly created Army of Georgia, composed of the XIV Corps and the XX Corps from the Army of the Cumberland, which served as the left wing in Sherman's March to the Sea. The total number of officers and men in Slocum's Army of Georgia was 26,703. The XIV Corps, commanded by Brig. Gen. Jefferson C. Davis, had 13,962 officers and men. The XX Corps, commanded by Brig. Gen. Alpheus S. Williams, had 13, 714 officers and men. The other wing, consisting of the XV and XVII Corps of the Army of the Tennessee, was commanded by Gen. Oliver O. Howard. Sherman's Army travelled light. Individual soldiers carried only minimal amounts of supplies, ammunition, rations. The Army, cut off from its supply base, partially lived off captured supplies. Sherman brought sufficient rations for the initial campaigns. He wrote, \\"I had wagons enough loaded with essentials, and beef cattle enough to feed on for more than a month, and had the census statistics showing the produce of every county through which I desired to pass. No military expedition was ever based on sounder or surer data.\\" Each brigade had 50 enlisted men and one officer foraging team for supplying food. Approximately 3,000 infantrymen were engaged in foraging on any given day of the March. That represents 5% of all infantrymen on the March. The Savannah campaign was launched on November 15 and concluded with the capture and occupation of Savannah on December 21, 1864 (36 days). There were 25 days of actual marching. Slocum's army traversed approximately 300 miles (480 km). Slocum's Army of Georgia moved, on average, 12 to 15 miles per day and passed through 31 counties in Georgia. The Union column traversed 15 major creeks, streams and rivers that required pontoon bridges. During the march, Slocum's troops employed individuals who were newly freed from slavery as pontoon builders and road-building detachments. The average distance of each crossing was 230 feet. Between Sherman's two armies, pioneers were required to build over 100 miles of corduroy roads. Weather was relatively clear, as it only rained on two days. For Slocum's Army of Georgia, there were no major battles fought during the Savannah campaign. Most of the actions were, by Union accounts, skirmishes or small actions. General Sherman's Army captured two major cities during the March to the Sea. These cities were the Milledgeville, Capitol of Georgia, and Savannah, Georgia, the principal seaport city of Georgia. Both cities were occupied by the Union Army and there was little destruction of property caused by soldiers. Both cities remained intact. The Union Army, in both cases, was credited with protecting these cities. In Savannah, the mayor of the city and aldermen thanked General Sherman and Slocum's subordinate, General Geary. Upon reaching Savannah, Slocum took the surrender of the city on December 21, 1864. Slocum then set up fire guards and prevented the city of Savannah from being damaged. On December 22, Sherman telegraphed Abraham Lincoln, presenting Savannah as a Christmas present to Lincoln and the Union. After the capture of the city, Slocum recommended to Sherman that Confederate Gen. William J. Hardee's corps, whose only escape route was north over a causeway, be cut off. But Sherman rejected Slocum's plan, and Hardee escaped, to fight again at Bentonville. = Carolinas Campaign = The Carolinas Campaign was launched leaving Savannah in late January 1865. Slocum's troops marched a total of 425 miles (684 km) in 50 days. The march had been far more demanding than the March to the Sea, as the terrain was more difficult and there was much more rain. The Confederate forces opposing Sherman's army were even smaller than during the Savannah campaign. In mid-April, Confederate Gen. Johnston met with Confederate President Jefferson Davis in Greensboro, North Carolina. He confessed: > Our people are tired of the war, feel themselves whipped, and will not > fight. Our country is overrun, its military resources greatly diminished, > while the enemy's military power and resources were never greater and may be > increased to any extent desired. ... My small force is melting away like > snow before the sun. During the Carolinas Campaign, Slocum's army was heavily engaged at the Battle of Averasborough, on March 15‚Äì16, 1865, and the Battle of Bentonville, on March 19, 1865, where Slocum successfully held off a surprise assault by Gen. Joseph E. Johnston. After Slocum's defeat of the Confederate forces at Bentonville, an officer of Sherman's staff wrote: \\"Slocum was more than equal to the necessity of the hour, and his success justified General Sherman's selection of him as commander of the Left Wing of the Army.\\" Gen. Joseph E. Johnston surrendered to Gen. Sherman and his army on April 17, 1865, at Bennett's farm, Durham Station, North Carolina. Most of the damage inflicted by Sherman's army was in destruction of railroads, factories, cotton supplies and manufacturing, livestock, confiscation of food stores. Sherman imposed strict rules regarding both foraging and destruction of property. The principal loss to the Confederacy was the freeing of individuals from slavery. Estimated Confederate losses: 100 million dollars (1.4 billion in 2010 dollars) ‚Äì Estimated (General Sherman estimated this damage, but it was not based on any actual tallying of figures); 20 million dollars ‚Äì General Sherman estimated that this amount was confiscated by the Union Army during the March. The left wing of Sherman's march destroyed 125 miles of railroad track. As a direct result of Sherman's March through the South, thousands of slaves left their plantations and workplaces and joined Sherman's army as refugees. It is estimated that between 17,000 and 25,000 newly freed enslaved people followed Sherman's army during the march through Georgia. It is estimated that 8,000 of these newly freed individuals followed the army into Savannah. In addition, it is estimated that 7,587 individuals were freed from slavery in Savannah and its surrounding areas on December 21, 1864. Wherever Sherman's March went throughout Georgia and the Carolina's, he was enforcing the provisions of the Emancipation Proclamation. Both Army commanders under General Sherman were abolitionists who opposed slavery. General Oliver O. Howard of the Army of the Tennessee and General Henry W. Slocum were active in the anti-slavery movement. Several other general officers were abolitionists. Hundreds of men liberated from slavery served in the columns as teamsters, cooks, and cleared and built roads, etc. They helped in convoys, as wagoneers and teamsters, and helped in various camp duties. They provided service as guides and scouts, provided military intelligence about the position of the Confederate Army. Individuals liberated from slavery also informed Union commanders about where provisions could be found. Union officers praised these highly valued individuals. Formerly enslaved men also aided escaped Union soldiers. A Union officer wrote: \\"What they have done for the Army entitles them to their freedom or whatever they may desire.\\" Many of the Union soldiers saw the evils of slavery for the first time. Many of them commented in their letters home that it had changed their ideas about why the war was being fought. = End of the War = After Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston's surrender at Durham Station, North Carolina, General Slocum and the Army of Georgia made their way north to Washington, DC. The XIV and XX Corps participated in the Grand Army Review in Washington, DC, on Wednesday, May 24, 1865. Slocum commanded the Department of the Mississippi from April through September 1865. In this role, his \\"General Orders No. 22\\" appear as attachment number 12 in Carl Schurz's 1865 Report to Congress on the Condition of the South. The orders countermanded the attempt by the provisional governor of Mississippi, William Sharkey, to form a state militia independent of federal control. The militia was created to prevent newly freed slaves from exercising their rights as citizens. Section VII of his \\"General Orders No. 10\\" also appear in this report in attachment number 27. Here he makes it clear that, as long as courts grant equal privileges, ex-slaves are to be regulated by the same criminal statues as other citizens. With the end of the war, Slocum resigned from the army rather than revert to his prewar rank of colonel, and returned to Syracuse, New York. A year later, the army gave him an offer to come back into service as commander of the 31st US Infantry, but he turned it down. Postbellum life Henry Warner Slocum Slocum ran as the Democratic candidate for Secretary of State of New York in 1865, but was defeated by fellow Gettysburg General Francis C. Barlow.Melton, 2007, p. 224. Slocum and his wife, Clara, and family moved to Brooklyn, New York, in 1866. They resided at 465 Clinton Avenue.Melton, 2007, p. 226. After resuming work as a lawyer, he declined an offer to return to the U.S. Army as a colonel. In 1868, Slocum was president of New York's electoral college.Melton, 2007, pp. 228-229. On January 6, 1869, he was elected as a companion of the New York Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. Slocum was elected as a Democrat to the 41st and 42nd Congresses (March 4, 1869 ‚Äì March 3, 1873). He was not a candidate for renomination in 1872. Instead, he resumed the practice of law. In 1882, he was elected Representative at large from New York to the 48th Congress (March 3, 1883 ‚Äì March 4, 1885). Slocum took an active interest in military and veterans' affairs. He worked in Congress for the exoneration of Major General Fitz John Porter who was court-martialed after the Second Battle of Bull Run.Melton, p. 236. Slocum gave a strong speech on Porter's behalf in Congress on January 18, 1884.Slocum, Charles E. The Life and Services of Major-General Henry Warner Slocum. Toledo: Slocum Publishing, 1913, p. 338. In 1882, Slocum narrowly missed being nominated to be the Democratic candidate for governor of New York. In the first two ballots, Slocum was tied with candidate Roswell P. Flower, a Wall Street lawyer. To break the tie, the convention selected future President Grover Cleveland on the third ballot. In 1885, Slocum was Grand Marshal of President Grover Cleveland's first inaugural parade in Washington, D.C.Melton, 2007, p. 235. Slocum was a major investor in a number of companies and became director of the People's Trust Company, the Williamsburg City Fire Insurance Company, and other successful ventures.Fox, 1904, p. 114. Slocum was also a trustee of the Park Savings Bank of Brooklyn, New York, which failed in the depression of 1876. In 1875, Slocum launched a campaign for civil service reform in the city of Brooklyn. He advocated for the hiring of qualified representatives rather than political appointments. Slocum was appointed Commissioner of the department of city works of Brooklyn, New York in 1876 and was involved in many civic improvements, from surface transportation to the Brooklyn Bridge. Slocum was an early advocate for the building of the Brooklyn Bridge, which would link Brooklyn to Manhattan. Slocum went on a study mission to view other bridges built by proposed Brooklyn Bridge designer John Roebling. He was an early investor in the Brooklyn Bridge and was appointed to the Board of Directors.McCullough, The Great Bridge, pp. 103-104. He advocated unsuccessfully for having no bridge tolls.Antietam on the Web Slocum's name is prominent on a bronze tablet that is located on one of the bridge's towers. Slocum was also active in the building of streetcar systems in Brooklyn. He founded and was president of the Brooklyn Crosstown Railroad,Annual Report of the State Engineer and Surveyor of the State of New York (Albany: Weed, Parsons, and Co., 1873), pp. 23, 989. which started service in 1872 and became one of the most profitable streetcar lines in the city.Melton, 2007, pp. 240-241. In addition, he was a large stockholder in other rail lines and was president of the Brooklyn and Coney Island Railroad Company. He was an early advocate of converting the horse-drawn rail cars to electricity.Fox, William F. and the New York Monuments Commission. In Memoriam: Henry Warner Slocum, 1826-1894. Albany, NY: J. B. Lyon, 1904. Also known as Slocum and His Men: The Twelfth Corps, p. 114. In 1877, Slocum was elected president of the Society of the Army of the Potomac, at a reunion in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1880, Slocum traveled with his family to Europe. In addition to serving again in the Congress (beginning in 1883), Slocum remained active in Civil War veterans' affairs. He was president of the Board of Trustees of the New York State Soldiers' and Sailors' Home in Bath, New York, serving until 1887, and was a member of the New York Monuments Commission for the battlefield of Gettysburg. He served on this commission until his death. Slocum remained friends with Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman until Sherman's death in 1891. Both Gen. Oliver Howard and Gen. Slocum planned Sherman's funeral and were honorary pall bearers. Slocum never wrote his memoirs, as had other prominent Union generals. He, however wrote a number of articles about his wartime service for popular magazines, such as Century Magazine. These articles were later reprinted in Battles and Leaders of the Civil War in 1887.Slocum, Henry W. \\"Sherman's March from Savannah to Bentonville.\\" In Battles and Leaders of the Civil War, Vol. 4, Century Magazine, New York: Thomas Yoseloff, Inc., 1887, 681-695.Slocum, H. W. \\"Final operations of Sherman's Army.\\" In Battles and Leaders of the Civil War, Vol. 4, Century Magazine, New York: Thomas Yoseloff, Inc., 1887, 754-758. Slocum died of liver disease in Brooklyn, New York, on April 14, 1894. He was interred at Green-Wood Cemetery, where Gen. Fitz-John Porter also is interred. A former member of his staff wrote of him, in memoriam: \\"In all the sterling qualities that go to make up a man, I have seldom met the equal or superior of Major General Henry W. Slocum. Firm and resolute of purpose, yet with so much modesty, so little of self-assertion; so faithful in the performance of whatever he believed to be his duty; so independent in his speech and conduct, whatever might be the future result.\\" Namesakes Equestrian statues of Slocum are located at Steven's Knoll and Culp's Hill, Gettysburg battlefield (dedicated on September 19, 1902), and in Grand Army Plaza, Brooklyn, New York (dedicated on Memorial Day, May 30, 1905). A steamship, the General Slocum, was named for him; it had a disastrous fire on board in 1904 with much loss of life. Fort Slocum, New York, guarded the entrance to New York Harbor from Long Island Sound from 1867 to 1965 when it was deactivated by the US Army. It was officially named Fort Slocum in 1896. A United States Army transport ship used for carrying soldiers and equipment during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War was named for General Slocum. It transported troops from San Francisco to the Philippines beginning in 1898.

The same arena was renamed EnergySolutions Arena (now Vivint Smart Home Arena) in late 2006. Temporary signage covered up the previous Delta Center logo after the new naming rights sponsor was announced. Naming rights are a financial transaction and form of advertising whereby a corporation or other entity purchases the right to name a facility or event, typically for a defined period of time. For properties such as multi-purpose arenas, performing arts venues, or sports fields, the term ranges from three to 20 years. Longer terms are more common for higher profile venues such as professional sports facilities.Kamiya, Setsuko, \\"You name it: Rights for more municipal sites go on sale\\", Japan Times, 20 September 2011, p. 3. The distinctive characteristic for this type of naming rights is that the buyer gets a marketing property to promote products and services, promote customer retention and/or increase market share. There are several forms of corporate sponsored names. For example, a presenting sponsor attaches the name of the corporation or brand at the end (or, sometimes, beginning) of a generic, usually traditional, name (e.g. Mall of America Field at Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome); or, a title sponsor replaces the original name of the property with a corporate-sponsored one, with no reference to the previous name. Stadium naming Stadium naming may have shifted in recent years to promoting corporate trade names, but in earlier decades is largely traced to the family names of company founders. The record for the highest amount paid for naming rights belongs to Scotiabank Arena. On August 29, 2017, a 20-year/$800 Million (CAD) sponsorship deal was reached between Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment and Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia to rename Toronto's Air Canada Centre. The home of the NHL's Toronto Maple Leafs and NBA's Toronto Raptors became known as Scotiabank Arena on July 1, 2018. Prior to the Scotiabank Arena deal, the record belonged to Citi Field (opened in 2009) and Barclays Center (opened in 2012), both located in New York City, US. Each garnered deals of $20 million (USD) per year for at least 20 years.Wolf, Barnet D. \\"The Name Game: Company banners flying on more college stadiums, arenas\\", The Columbus Dispatch, April 29, 2007. Accessed May 20, 2007. The New Meadowlands Stadium, shared home of the New York Giants and New York Jets in East Rutherford, New Jersey, US, was expected to eclipse both deals, with experts estimating it would value $25‚Äì30 million annually.Frankston Lorin, Janet. \\"Prices of Stadium Sponsorships Soar\\", February 10, 2008, Associated Press. It ultimately fell short of that benchmark, with MetLife Stadium earning $17 million annually from its naming rights deal with MetLife. Occasionally, the purchaser of a stadium's naming rights may choose to donate those rights to an outside organization, typically one to which it is closely related. Probably the most notable example of this is Friends Arena, a major stadium in Stockholm. The facility was originally known as Swedbank Arena, but in 2012 that company donated those rights to the Friends Foundation, an organization seeking to combat school bullying that is heavily sponsored by Swedbank. More recently, the Kentucky Farm Bureau, an organization promoting the interests of Kentucky farmers that is best known to the non-farming public for its insurance business, acquired the naming rights to the University of Kentucky's new baseball park in 2018. The Farm Bureau in turn donated those naming rights to the Kentucky Department of Agriculture, naming the venue Kentucky Proud Park. The sponsored name is the brand used by said state agency in its marketing campaign for agricultural products produced in that state. =In the United States= Naming rights in United States may have been traced back to 1912 with the opening of Fenway Park in Boston. The stadium's owner had owned a realty company called \\"Fenway Realty\\" (itself named for a nearby parkland), so the promotional value of the naming has been considered. Despite this, it is more widely believed to have begun in 1926 when William Wrigley, the chewing gum magnate and owner of the Chicago Cubs, named his team's stadium \\"Wrigley Field.\\" In 1953, Anheuser-Busch head and St. Louis Cardinals owner August Busch, Jr. proposed renaming Sportsman's Park, occupied by the Cardinals, \\"Budweiser Stadium\\". When this idea was rejected by Ford Frick, the Commissioner of Baseball at that time, Anheuser-Busch then proposed the title \\"Busch Stadium\\" after one of the company's founders. The name was readily approved, and Anheuser-Busch subsequently released a new product called \\"Busch Bavarian Beer\\" (now known as Busch Beer). The name would later be shifted to the Busch Memorial Stadium in 1966, shortened in the 1970s to \\"Busch Stadium\\" and remained the stadium's name until it closed in 2005. By that time, Major League Baseball's policy had changed ‚Äì with Coors Field in Denver and Miller Park in Milwaukee going up in that span ‚Äì and Anheuser-Busch (who retained the naming rights after selling the team) was able to use the same name for the Cardinals' new stadium which opened on April 4, 2006. Foxboro Stadium, the home of the New England Patriots between 1970 and 2001, was an early example of a team selling naming rights to a company that did not own it, naming the stadium Schaefer Stadium after the beer company from its erection until 1983. The public reaction to this practice is mixed. Naming rights sold to new venues have largely been accepted, especially if the buyer is well-established and has strong local connections to the area, such as the cases of Rich Stadium (now New Era Field) in the Buffalo suburb of Orchard Park, Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, and Coors Field in Denver. Selling the naming rights to an already-existing venue has been notably less successful, as in the attempt to rename Candlestick Park in San Francisco to 3Com Park. The general public (and some media outlets) continued to call the facility what it had been known as for over three decades-i.e. Candlestick Park. After the agreement with 3Com expired, the rights were resold to Monster Cable, and the stadium was renamed Monster Park. San Francisco voters responded by passing an initiative (Proposition H) in the November 2004 elections that essentially stipulated the name must revert to Candlestick Park once the contract with Monster expired in 2008. The initiative proved largely ceremonial, however, and it was overturned by the passage of Proposition C in 2009 in response to desperate economic times. The naming rights to the park were never resold and the stadium closed in 2014. =Outside the United States= Sports stadiums with naming rights deals are not limited to the United States. \\"Named\\" stadiums can be found in countries including Australia, Japan, China, Finland, Canada, Israel and Germany, where 8 of the 10 largest football stadiums have their naming rights sold to corporate sponsors. The practice is widening in the United Kingdom; for instance the current stadium of Bolton Wanderers is the University of Bolton Stadium (after 17 years as Reebok Stadium and 4 as Macron Stadium) and Arsenal Football Club's stadium (opened for the 2006/2007 season) is the Emirates Stadium, their previous ground being Arsenal Stadium. In cricket, the most famous example is The Oval, home of Surrey County Cricket Club. It has had several sponsors over the years, and is currently known as \\"The Kia Oval\\", having originally been known as the \\"Kennington Oval\\", the district of London in which it is.  Other examples  While the highest prices have traditionally been paid for stadium rights, many companies and individuals have found that selling their naming rights can be an important consideration in funding their business. In the last few years many new categories have opened up, such as the selling of the rights to name a new monkey species for $650,000.Internet Casino buys monkey naming rights Associated Press (2005), nbcnews.com =Public transit= Naming rights to public transit stations have been sold in Las Vegas and Philadelphia (NRG station, Jefferson Station, and Penn Medicine station).\\"SEPTA Board Approves Station Naming Rights Agreement\\", SEPTA Such sales have been contemplated in New York\\"A Subway Subway?\\" , Gothamist and Boston, and ruled out in San Francisco.Subway Sponsor Plan Irks Some Bostonians A sponsorship for the MBTA's State Street station by Citizens Bank lasted from 1997 to 2000. In Tampa, naming rights for both streetcar stations and rolling stock are available. In December 2016, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority approved a naming rights policy for its facilities and routes, but later rescinded the policy two months later over potential lawsuits for skipping sponsors. An example outside of the United States would be Monumento Station in the Manila Light Rail Transit System in the Philippines, which was renamed Yamaha Monumento Station on February 14, 2018, after renovations. =Sports= Naming rights in the realm of sports is common for both stadiums and sports competitions and series. In addition, some sports teams adopt a name of the sponsor as their team or club name (see List of sports clubs named after a sponsor). =Competitions= In association football, leagues and cup competitions sometimes adopt the name of their sponsors. For example, England's Premier League was known as the Barclays Premier League until 2016, and its FA Cup is officially the Emirates FA Cup. The Premier League announced in 2015 that it would not accept a title sponsorship beginning in the 2016‚Äì17 season. Since 2020, the French Professional Football Ligue adopted the name of Ligue 1 Uber Eats. In college football, all of the Division I bowl games have either modified or abandoned their traditional names in favor of title sponsors. While most include the traditional name in some form (e.g., Capital One Orange Bowl, The Rose Bowl Game presented by Northwestern Mutual), there have been bowl games that have totally eliminated their traditional name in favor of solely using a corporate sponsor's name in an effort to dissuade fans from using a generic name (for instance, the former Tangerine Bowl is now the Camping World Bowl, and the Gator Bowl was for a time known as the TaxSlayer Bowl), a move that generally is treated with consternation from fans. Team names and even whole leagues have occasionally been sold to corporate sponsors as well (examples include the New York Red Bulls in the former case, the NET10 Wireless Arena Football League for the latter), but this is generally rare in the United States and more common in other parts of the world. During the 1980s, sanctioned auto races in NASCAR and IndyCar began to abandon their traditional names in favor of exclusive sponsor names. The trend expanded rapidly in NASCAR such that in 1991, all 29 races in the Winston Cup Series featured sponsor names (including the Daytona 500, which was given a presenting sponsor as the Daytona 500 by STP), with little or no reference to the original names. As of the 2010s, very few exceptions remain in NASCAR (such as the Daytona 500, which no longer uses the presenting sponsor), and typically races without sponsor names only lack them because a suitable sponsor could not be secured in enough time. IndyCar follows suit, with most races (except the very traditional Indianapolis 500) embracing title sponsorship. Sports media coverage (such as ESPN news reports) typically refer to races by the town in which the home race track is held, avoiding the use of sponsored names in news coverage. =Media= Television and radio series, especially in the early days of each medium, frequently sold the naming rights to their programs to sponsors, most of whom bankrolled the program; examples include Texaco Star Theatre and The Philco Television Playhouse. This form of sponsorship fell out of favor in the late 1950s.  Social connotations  In some places, and especially in the UK and United States, the naming or renaming of arenas or events is often met with disapproval from the general public. Some people see it as an example of a selling out,\\"Glastonbury: a corporate sell-out?\\", BBC\\"Dreading festival\\", The Guardian, 26 August 2005\\"Farewell Telstra Dome\\", Herald Sun especially when they see no obvious benefit to themselves. They often refuse to use a new name, preferring instead to use a non-branded name, especially in colloquial situations. Rebranding can also lead to confusion. In such cases, there may be a lengthy period during which the property is known by both names. A common example is Willis Tower in Chicago which was and often still is referred to as the \\"Sears Tower\\", even though the building was sold some time ago. Sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro, Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games prohibit the use of corporate-sponsored name on stadiums, construing the practice as a form of ambush marketing. Any stadium that uses a corporate- purchased name must always be referred to in all event-related media (including live broadcasts) by a generic name (e.g., General Motors Place was referred to as \\"Canada Hockey Place\\" during the 2010 Winter Olympics). The regular corporate signage of a site, including billboards and deck advertising, is usually covered up in these cases; in the FIFA case the signage is replaced solely with FIFA sponsors. However, with the near- universal use of LED ribbon boards, scoreboards, and sideline boardings since the mid-2000s in most major league sites where only known sponsors have advertising displayed, \\"neutralizing\\" an arena has become a much easier process than in the past.  Nonprofit usage  A nonprofit organization has the option to recognize a major gift from a donor by bestowing naming rights to a property in recognition of the financial support. This is not a financial transaction in the style of the private sector. For example, in honor of the more than $60 million donated over the years by one donor to the National Air and Space Museum properties, the directors of the Smithsonian Institution chose to name its satellite facility in Loudoun County, Virginia, after the donor, calling it the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. Walgreen Coast, a portion of the coast of Antarctica was so named because the Walgreens pharmacy chain sponsored the Byrd Antarctic Expedition.

The other four divisions were the Mekoche, Kispoko, Pekowi, and Hathawekela. (All five division names have been spelled in a great variety of ways.) Together these divisions formed the loose confederacy that was the Shawnee tribe. Chillicothe division By tradition, each Shawnee division had certain roles it performed on behalf of the entire tribe, although these customs were fading by the time they were recorded in writing by European- Americans. The Chillicothe division often provided political leadership for the tribe. A famous Chillicothe leader was Chief Blackfish. Chillicothe villages The village where the chief of the Chillicothe division lived was also known as \\"Chillicothe\\". When this principal village was relocated, often as a result of war or the expansion of European-American settlement, the new village would be again be called \\"Chillicothe\\". Not all Shawnees living in the town belonged to the Chillicothe division, and some residents were from tribes other than the Shawnee. There are numerous Shawnee Chillicothe villages in the historical record, which has occasionally caused some confusion. =Chillicothes on the Scioto= Lower Shawnee Town was a large Shawnee town on the Ohio River, founded about 1734 by Shawnees. The name of the town was not recorded, but scholars believe it may have been \\"Chillicothe\\".Henderson 32. The town grew to be a major trading hub in the years leading up to the French and Indian War, although it was of lesser political importance than Logstown, upriver on the Ohio. Members from most if not all five Shawnee divisions lived in the town, as well as an assortment of other Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans, with an estimated total population of 1,200 or more people. Lower Shawnee Town was abandoned in 1758, after much of the town was destroyed by a flood in November of that year.Charles Augustus Hanna, The Wilderness Trail: Or, The Ventures and Adventures of the Pennsylvania Traders on the Allegheny Path, Volume 1, Putnam's sons, 1911 The next Chillicothe (1758‚Äì1787) was one of seven Shawnee villages on the west bank of the Scioto River, near Paint Creek and the present U.S. city of Chillicothe, Ohio. The village may have been settled in the 1750s as Shawnees were returning to the Ohio Country after having been driven out and scattered by the Iroquois decades earlier. Cheeseekau, older brother of Tecumseh, was probably born here about 1761. Tecumseh may have been born here in 1768, or at nearby Kisposko town. In 1762, Chillicothe contained about 300 warriors (perhaps 1,200 people), which meant that the majority of Shawnees then living in Ohio lived there.Sugden, Tecumseh, 16‚Äì19. European influences, especially in trade goods such as guns, kettles, and clothing, were prevalent among the Shawnee at this time. David Jones, a British missionary, visited the town in 1773 and noted that a British fur trader named Moses Henry lived there. In the early 1770s, the Shawnee towns on the Scioto were the focus a Shawnee-led movement formed to resist British colonial expansion following the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix. The Shawnees were ultimately unsuccessful in forging a large alliance, however, and fought Dunmore's War in 1774 with little support from other tribes. An army from Virginia marched to the Scioto villages and forced the Shawnees to accept the boundary established in the Stanwix treaty. After the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, many Chillicothe residents relocated northwest to the Little Miami River. Shawnee villagers continued to live on the Scioto, along with some Cherokees, until the village was attacked by Americans in 1787 during the Northwest Indian War. =Old Chillicothe= Site of Old Chillicothe Because of its prominence in the American Revolutionary War, Old Chillicothe (1774‚Äì1780) was the most famous of the Shawnee Chillicothe villages in American history. It is often known in historical writing as \\"Old Chillicothe\\" in order to distinguish it from the present Ohio city of Chillicothe. Settlement of the village began in 1774. Located on the Little Miami River, the area is now known as Oldtown, near present-day Xenia. Chillicothe was the home of Blackfish, war chief of the division. From here the Shawnees staged numerous raids into Kentucky, where they hoped to drive out the American settlers. Frontiersman Daniel Boone was captured in Kentucky in 1778 by Chief Blackfish and brought to Chillicothe with other prisoners. Boone was adopted into the tribe and lived for several months at Chillicothe. According to tradition the village was the birthplace of Tecumseh, the famous Shawnee leader. Tecumseh, however, was born in 1768, before this Chillicothe was settled. As mentioned above, he was likely born at a village on the Scioto River. After Chief Blackfish unsuccessfully besieged Boonesborough, Kentucky in 1778, Kentuckians crossed the Ohio River and attacked Chillicothe on 29 May 1779. Blackfish successfully defended the town, but was shot in the leg and later died when the wound became infected. In 1780, in retaliation for Bird's invasion of Kentucky, George Rogers Clark led the Kentucky militia up the Little Miami River. Chillicothe was abandoned as Clark approached. Clark burned the town and destroyed the surrounding crops. (By some accounts, the Shawnees had burned the town before fleeing, to deny the Kentuckians plunder and supplies.) Clark marched further north and fought a battle at Pekowi town. =Other Chillicothes= Sailing ship Chillicothe Chillicothe on the Great Miami River (1780‚Äì1782) was settled after the destruction of the previous village. Although a British army surrendered at Yorktown in October 1781, the war on the frontier continued unabated. In Kentucky, the Americans were defeated at the Battle of Blue Licks in August 1782, the worst defeat of the war for the Kentuckians. In retaliation, in November Clark led another expedition into Ohio, the last major campaign of the war. Chillicothe and four other villages were destroyed. The next Chillicothe was on the St. Mary's River (1783‚Äì1790). Another Chillicothe (1788‚Äì1792) was located on the Maumee River, near present Fort Wayne, Indiana. A Chillicothe (1787‚Äì?) was located on the west bank of the Mississippi River, north of present Cape Girardeau, Missouri. ReferencesBibliography *Bakeless, John.

Background For over a thousand years ben Asher has been regarded by Jews of all streams as having produced the most accurate version of the Masoretic Text. Since his day, both handwritten manuscripts of the Tanakh and printed versions strove to follow his system and continue to do so. He lived and worked in the city of Tiberias on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. The Aleppo Codex Ben Asher was descended from a long line of Masoretes, starting with someone called Asher, but nothing is known about them other than their names. His father, Moses ben Asher, is credited with writing the Cairo Codex of the Prophets (895 CE). If authentic, it is among the oldest manuscripts containing a large proportion of the Hebrew Bible. Umberto Cassuto used this manuscript as the basis of his edition of the Hebrew Bible. Aaron ben Asher himself added vowelization and cantillation notes, and mesorah to the Aleppo Codex, correcting its letter-text according to the masorah. Maimonides accepted the views of ben Asher only in regard to open and closed sections, but apparently admired his work generally and helped to establish and spread his authority. Referring to a Bible manuscript then in Egypt, Maimonides wrote: \\"All relied on it, since it was corrected by ben Asher and was worked on and analyzed by him for many years, and was proofread many times in accordance with the masorah, and I based myself on this manuscript in the Sefer Torah that I wrote\\". First serious scribe Aaron ben Moses ben Asher was the first to take Hebrew grammar seriously. He was the first systematic Hebrew grammarian. His Sefer Dikdukei ha-Te'amim (Grammar or Analysis of the Accents) was an original collection of grammatical rules and masoretic information. Grammatical principles were not at that time considered worthy of independent study. The value of this work is that the grammatical rules presented by ben Asher reveal the linguistic background of vocalization for the first time. He had a tremendous influence on subsequent Biblical grammar and scholarship. A rival system of note was that developed by the school of ben Naphtali. Was ben Asher a Karaite? There is a debate among scholars as to whether Aaron ben Asher was a Karaite. Documents found in the Cairo Geniza may suggest that ben Asher was a Karaite. One of the strongest arguments against this view is that it would be astonishing if Maimonides, famously opposed to the Karaites, had followed the authority of a Karaite, even in the matter of open and closed sections. In his critiques of Karaites, Saadia Gaon mentioned a \\"ben Asher.\\" Until recently, it never occurred to scholars to associate this \\"ben Asher\\" with the famous Aaron ben Asher of Tiberias. Recent research indicates, however, that it is possible. This may explain why he preferred the \\"ben Naphtali\\" system. If Aaron ben Asher was indeed a Karaite, it may be argued that he was the most influential Karaite of all time.

Biography Perle was born in Bayonne, New Jersey. He graduated from DePaul University, where he studied with Wesley LaViolette and received private lessons from Ernst Krenek. Later, he served as a technician fifth grade in the United States Army during World War II.Find a Grave, memorial page for George Perle (1915‚Äì2009). Find a Grave Memorial #72,375,644. Calverton National Cemetery, Calverton, Suffolk County, New York, USA. He earned his doctorate at New York University in 1956. Perle composed with a technique of his own devising called \\"twelve-tone tonality\\". This technique was different from, but related to, the twelve-tone technique of the Second Viennese School,Perle (1992). of which he was an \\"early admirer\\" and whose techniques he used aspects of but never fully adopted. Perle's former student Paul Lansky described Perle's twelve-tone tonality thus: In 1968, Perle cofounded the Alban Berg Society with Igor Stravinsky and Hans F. Redlich, who had the idea (according to Perle in his letter to Glen Flax of 4/1/89). Perle's important work on Berg includes documenting that the third act of Lulu, rather than being an unfinished sketch, was actually three-fifths complete and that the Lyric Suite contains a secret program dedicated to Berg's love-affair. After retiring from Queens College in 1985, he became a professor emeritus at the Aaron Copland School of Music. In 1986, Perle was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for Music for his Fourth Wind Quintet and also a MacArthur Fellowship. In about 1989 Perle became composer-in-residence for the San Francisco Symphony, a three-year appointment. It was also around this time that he had published his fourth book entitled The Listening Composer. He died aged 93 in his home in New York City in January 2009. He was subsequently buried in Calverton National Cemetery. On his headstone are inscribed the words \\"An die Musik.\\" A growing number of younger artists have come to express their appreciation for Perle. In the run-up to his 100th birthday celebrations the composer-pianist Michael Brown released a well received CD of a sampling of Perle's work for piano. Perle was married to the sculptor Laura Slobe from 1940 to 1952; the couple were members of the Socialist Workers Party. His second wife, Barbara Philips, died in 1978. Perle was survived at his death by his third wife, the former Shirley Gabis Rhoads, two daughters, and a stepdaughter.

QTLs are mapped by identifying which molecular markers (such as SNPs or AFLPs) correlate with an observed trait. This is often an early step in identifying and sequencing the actual genes that cause the trait variation. Definition A quantitative trait locus (QTL) is a region of DNA which is associated with a particular phenotypic trait, which varies in degree and which can be attributed to polygenic effects, i.e., the product of two or more genes, and their environment. These QTLs are often found on different chromosomes. The number of QTLs which explain variation in the phenotypic trait indicates the genetic architecture of a trait. It may indicate that plant height is controlled by many genes of small effect, or by a few genes of large effect. Typically, QTLs underlie continuous traits (those traits which vary continuously, e.g. height) as opposed to discrete traits (traits that have two or several character values, e.g. red hair in humans, a recessive trait, or smooth vs. wrinkled peas used by Mendel in his experiments). Moreover, a single phenotypic trait is usually determined by many genes. Consequently, many QTLs are associated with a single trait. Another use of QTLs is to identify candidate genes underlying a trait. Once a region of DNA is identified as contributing to a phenotype, it can be sequenced. The DNA sequence of any genes in this region can then be compared to a database of DNA for genes whose function is already known, being this task fundamental for marker-assisted crop improvement. History Mendelian inheritance was rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century. As Mendel's ideas spread, geneticists began to connect Mendel's rules of inheritance of single factors to Darwinian evolution. For early geneticists, it was not immediately clear that the smooth variation in traits like body size (i.e., Incomplete Dominance) was caused by the inheritance of single genetic factors. Although Darwin himself observed that inbred features of fancy pigeons were inherited in accordance with Mendel's laws (although Darwin didn't actually know about Mendel's ideas when he made the observation), it was not obvious that these features selected by fancy pigeon breeders can similarly explain quantitative variation in nature. An early attempt by William Ernest Castle to unify the laws of Mendelian inheritance with Darwin's theory of speciation invoked the idea that species become distinct from one another as one species or the other acquires a novel Mendelian factor. Castle's conclusion was based on the observation that novel traits that could be studied in the lab and that show Mendelian inheritance patterns reflect a large deviation from the wild type, and Castle believed that acquisition of such features is the basis of \\"discontinuous variation\\" that characterizes speciation. Darwin discussed the inheritance of similar mutant features but did not invoke them as a requirement of speciation. Instead Darwin used the emergence of such features in breeding populations as evidence that mutation can occur at random within breeding populations, which is a central premise of his model of selection in nature. Later in his career, Castle would refine his model for speciation to allow for small variation to contribute to speciation over time. He also was able to demonstrate this point by selectively breeding laboratory populations of rats to obtain a hooded phenotype over several generations. Castle's was perhaps the first attempt made in the scientific literature to direct evolution by artificial selection of a trait with continuous underlying variation, however the practice had previously been widely employed in the development of agriculture to obtain livestock or plants with favorable features from populations that show quantitative variation in traits like body size or grain yield. Castle's work was among the first to attempt to unify the recently rediscovered laws of Mendelian inheritance with Darwin's theory of evolution. Still, it would be almost thirty years until the theoretical framework for evolution of complex traits would be widely formalized. In an early summary of the theory of evolution of continuous variation, Sewall Wright, a graduate student who trained under Castle, summarized contemporary thinking about the genetic basis of quantitative natural variation: \\"As genetic studies continued, ever smaller differences were found to mendelize, and any character, sufficiently investigated, turned out to be affected by many factors.\\" Wright and others formalized population genetics theory that had been worked out over the preceding 30 years explaining how such traits can be inherited and create stably breeding populations with unique characteristics. Quantitative trait genetics today leverages Wright's observations about the statistical relationship between genotype and phenotype in families and populations to understand how certain genetic features can affect variation in natural and derived populations. Quantitative traits Polygenic inheritance refers to inheritance of a phenotypic characteristic (trait) that is attributable to two or more genes and can be measured quantitatively. Multifactorial inheritance refers to polygenic inheritance that also includes interactions with the environment. Unlike monogenic traits, polygenic traits do not follow patterns of Mendelian inheritance (discrete categories). Instead, their phenotypes typically vary along a continuous gradient depicted by a bell curve.. An example of a polygenic trait is human skin color variation. Several genes factor into determining a person's natural skin color, so modifying only one of those genes can change skin color slightly or in some cases, such as for SLC24A5, moderately. Many disorders with genetic components are polygenic, including autism, cancer, diabetes and numerous others. Most phenotypic characteristics are the result of the interaction of multiple genes. Examples of disease processes generally considered to be results of many contributing factors: Congenital malformation * Cleft palate * Congenital dislocation of the hipEmery's Elements of Medical Genetics * Congenital heart defects * Neural tube defects * Pyloric stenosis * Talipes Adult onset diseases * Diabetes Mellitus * Cancer * Glaucoma * Hypertension * Ischaemic heart disease *Bipolar disorder * Schizophrenia * Psoriasis * Thyroid diseases * Alzheimer's Disease Multifactorially inherited diseases are said to constitute the majority of genetic disorders affecting humans which will result in hospitalization or special care of some kind. =Multifactorial traits in general= Traits controlled both by the environment and by genetic factors are called multifactorial. Usually, multifactorial traits outside of illness result in what we see as continuous characteristics in organisms, especially human organisms such as: height, skin color, and body mass. All of these phenotypes are complicated by a great deal of give-and-take between genes and environmental effects. The continuous distribution of traits such as height and skin color described above, reflects the action of genes that do not manifest typical patterns of dominance and recessiveness. Instead the contributions of each involved locus are thought to be additive. Writers have distinguished this kind of inheritance as polygenic, or quantitative inheritance. Thus, due to the nature of polygenic traits, inheritance will not follow the same pattern as a simple monohybrid or dihybrid cross. Polygenic inheritance can be explained as Mendelian inheritance at many loci, resulting in a trait which is normally-distributed. If n is the number of involved loci, then the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (a + b)2n will give the frequency of distribution of all n allele combinations. For a sufficiently high values of n, this binomial distribution will begin to resemble a normal distribution. From this viewpoint, a disease state will become apparent at one of the tails of the distribution, past some threshold value. Disease states of increasing severity will be expected the further one goes past the threshold and away from the mean. =Heritable disease and multifactorial inheritance= A mutation resulting in a disease state is often recessive, so both alleles must be mutant in order for the disease to be expressed phenotypically. A disease or syndrome may also be the result of the expression of mutant alleles at more than one locus. When more than one gene is involved, with or without the presence of environmental triggers, we say that the disease is the result of multifactorial inheritance. The more genes involved in the cross, the more the distribution of the genotypes will resemble a normal, or Gaussian distribution. This shows that multifactorial inheritance is polygenic, and genetic frequencies can be predicted by way of a polyhybrid Mendelian cross. Phenotypic frequencies are a different matter, especially if they are complicated by environmental factors. The paradigm of polygenic inheritance as being used to define multifactorial disease has encountered much disagreement. Turnpenny (2004) discusses how simple polygenic inheritance cannot explain some diseases such as the onset of Type I diabetes mellitus, and that in cases such as these, not all genes are thought to make an equal contribution. The assumption of polygenic inheritance is that all involved loci make an equal contribution to the symptoms of the disease. This should result in a normal curve distribution of genotypes. When it does not, the idea of polygenetic inheritance cannot be supported for that illness. =Examples= The above are well-known examples of diseases having both genetic and environmental components. Other examples involve atopic diseases such as eczema or dermatitis;spina bifida (open spine), and anencephaly (open skull). While schizophrenia is widely believed to be multifactorially genetic by biopsychiatrists, no characteristic genetic markers have been determined with any certainty. If it is shown that the brothers and sisters of the patient have the disease, then there is a strong chance that the disease is genetic and that the patient will also be a genetic carrier. This is not quite enough as it also needs to be proven that the pattern of inheritance is non-Mendelian. This would require studying dozens, even hundreds of different family pedigrees before a conclusion of multifactorial inheritance is drawn. This often takes several years. If multifactorial inheritance is indeed the case, then the chance of the patient contracting the disease is reduced only if cousins and more distant relatives have the disease. It must be stated that while multifactorially-inherited diseases tend to run in families, inheritance will not follow the same pattern as a simple monohybrid or dihybrid cross. If a genetic cause is suspected and little else is known about the illness, then it remains to be seen exactly how many genes are involved in the phenotypic expression of the disease. Once that is determined, the question must be answered: if two people have the required genes, why are there differences in expression between them? Generally, what makes the two individuals different are likely to be environmental factors. Due to the involved nature of genetic investigations needed to determine such inheritance patterns, this is not usually the first avenue of investigation one would choose to determine etiology. A QTL for osteoporosis on the human chromosome 20 QTL mapping Example of a genome-wide scan for QTL of osteoporosis For organisms whose genomes are known, one might now try to exclude genes in the identified region whose function is known with some certainty not to be connected with the trait in question. If the genome is not available, it may be an option to sequence the identified region and determine the putative functions of genes by their similarity to genes with known function, usually in other genomes. This can be done using BLAST, an online tool that allows users to enter a primary sequence and search for similar sequences within the BLAST database of genes from various organisms. It is often not the actual gene underlying the phenotypic trait, but rather a region of DNA that is closely linked with the gene Another interest of statistical geneticists using QTL mapping is to determine the complexity of the genetic architecture underlying a phenotypic trait. For example, they may be interested in knowing whether a phenotype is shaped by many independent loci, or by a few loci, and do those loci interact. This can provide information on how the phenotype may be evolving. In a recent development, classical QTL analyses were combined with gene expression profiling i.e. by DNA microarrays. Such expression QTLs (eQTLs) describe cis- and trans-controlling elements for the expression of often disease-associated genes. Observed epistatic effects have been found beneficial to identify the gene responsible by a cross- validation of genes within the interacting loci with metabolic pathway- and scientific literature databases. =Analysis of variance= The simplest method for QTL mapping is analysis of variance (ANOVA, sometimes called \\"marker regression\\") at the marker loci. In this method, in a backcross, one may calculate a t-statistic to compare the averages of the two marker genotype groups. For other types of crosses (such as the intercross), where there are more than two possible genotypes, one uses a more general form of ANOVA, which provides a so-called F-statistic. The ANOVA approach for QTL mapping has three important weaknesses. First, we do not receive separate estimates of QTL location and QTL effect. QTL location is indicated only by looking at which markers give the greatest differences between genotype group averages, and the apparent QTL effect at a marker will be smaller than the true QTL effect as a result of recombination between the marker and the QTL. Second, we must discard individuals whose genotypes are missing at the marker. Third, when the markers are widely spaced, the QTL may be quite far from all markers, and so the power for QTL detection will decrease. =Interval mapping= Lander and Botstein developed interval mapping, which overcomes the three disadvantages of analysis of variance at marker loci. Interval mapping is currently the most popular approach for QTL mapping in experimental crosses. The method makes use of a genetic map of the typed markers, and, like analysis of variance, assumes the presence of a single QTL. In interval mapping, each locus is considered one at a time and the logarithm of the odds ratio (LOD score) is calculated for the model that the given locus is a true QTL. The odds ratio is related to the Pearson correlation coefficient between the phenotype and the marker genotype for each individual in the experimental cross.Lynch, M. & Walsh, B. Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits edn 1 (Sinauer Associates, 1998). The term 'interval mapping' is used for estimating the position of a QTL within two markers (often indicated as 'marker-bracket'). Interval mapping is originally based on the maximum likelihood but there are also very good approximations possible with simple regression. The principle for QTL mapping is: 1) The Likelihood can be calculated for a given set of parameters (particularly QTL effect and QTL position) given the observed data on phenotypes and marker genotypes. 2) The estimates for the parameters are those where the likelihood is highest. 3) A significance threshold can be established by permutation testing. Conventional methods for the detection of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) are based on a comparison of single QTL models with a model assuming no QTL. For instance in the \\"interval mapping\\" methodMapping Mendelian factors underlying quantitative traits using RFLP linkage maps. ES Lander and D Botstein. Genetics. 1989 the likelihood for a single putative QTL is assessed at each location on the genome. However, QTLs located elsewhere on the genome can have an interfering effect. As a consequence, the power of detection may be compromised, and the estimates of locations and effects of QTLs may be biased (Lander and Botstein 1989; Knapp 1991). Even nonexisting so-called \\"ghost\\" QTLs may appear (Haley and Knott 1992; Martinez and Curnow 1992). Therefore, multiple QTLs could be mapped more efficiently and more accurately by using multiple QTL models.http://www.genetics.org/content/135/1/205.full.pdf One popular approach to handle QTL mapping where multiple QTL contribute to a trait is to iteratively scan the genome and add known QTL to the regression model as QTLs are identified. This method, termed composite interval mapping determine both the location and effects size of QTL more accurately than single-QTL approaches, especially in small mapping populations where the effect of correlation between genotypes in the mapping population may be problematic. =Composite interval mapping (CIM)= In this method, one performs interval mapping using a subset of marker loci as covariates. These markers serve as proxies for other QTLs to increase the resolution of interval mapping, by accounting for linked QTLs and reducing the residual variation. The key problem with CIM concerns the choice of suitable marker loci to serve as covariates; once these have been chosen, CIM turns the model selection problem into a single-dimensional scan. The choice of marker covariates has not been solved, however. Not surprisingly, the appropriate markers are those closest to the true QTLs, and so if one could find these, the QTL mapping problem would be complete anyway. =Family-pedigree based mapping = Family based QTL mapping, or Family-pedigree based mapping (Linkage and association mapping), involves multiple families instead of a single family. Family based QTL mapping has been the only way for mapping of genes where experimental crosses are difficult to make. However, due to some advantages, now plant geneticists are attempting to incorporate some of the methods pioneered in human genetics. Using family-pedigree based approach has been discussed (Bink et al. 2008). Family-based linkage and association has been successfully implemented (Rosyara et al. 2009) See also *Association Mapping *Family based QTL mapping *Epistasis *Dominance (genetics) *Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) *Genetic predisposition *Nested Association Mapping *Oncogene *Genetic susceptibility References * Bink MCAM, Boer MP, ter Braak CJF, Jansen J, Voorrips RE, van de Weg WE: Bayesian analysis of complex traits in pedigreed plant populations.

Typically this involves vibrational energy being gained by a molecule as incident photons from a visible laser are shifted to lower energy. This is called normal Stokes Raman scattering. The effect is exploited by chemists and physicists to gain information about materials for a variety of purposes by performing various forms of Raman spectroscopy. Many other variants of Raman spectroscopy allow rotational energy to be examined (if gas samples are used) and electronic energy levels may be examined if an X-ray source is used in addition to other possibilities. More complex techniques involving pulsed lasers, multiple laser beams and so on are known. Light has a certain probability of being scattered by a material. When photons are scattered, most of them are elastically scattered (Rayleigh scattering), such that the scattered photons have the same energy (frequency, wavelength and color) as the incident photons but different direction. Rayleigh scattering usually has an intensity in the range 0.1% to 0.01% relative to that of a radiation source. An even smaller fraction of the scattered photons (approximately 1 in 10 million) can be scattered inelastically, with the scattered photons having an energy different (usually lower) from those of the incident photons‚Äîthese are Raman scattered photons. Because of conservation of energy, the material either gains or loses energy in the process. Rayleigh scattering was discovered and explained in the 19th century. The Raman effect is named after Indian scientist C. V. Raman, who discovered it in 1928 with assistance from his student K. S. Krishnan. Raman was awarded the Nobel prize in Physics in 1930 for his discovery. The effect had been predicted theoretically by Adolf Smekal in 1923.  History  The elastic light scattering phenomena called Rayleigh scattering, in which light retains its energy, was described in the 19th century. The intensity of Rayleigh scattering is about 10‚àí3 to 10‚àí4 compared to the intensity of the exciting source. In 1908, another form of elastic scattering, called Mie scattering was discovered. The inelastic scattering of light was predicted by Adolf Smekal in 1923 and in older German-language literature it has been referred to as the Smekal-Raman-Effekt. In 1922, Indian physicist C. V. Raman published his work on the \\"Molecular Diffraction of Light\\", the first of a series of investigations with his collaborators that ultimately led to his discovery (on 28 February 1928) of the radiation effect that bears his name. The Raman effect was first reported by Raman and his coworker K. S. Krishnan, and independently by Grigory Landsberg and Leonid Mandelstam, in Moscow on 21 February 1928 (one week earlier than Raman and Krishnan). In the former Soviet Union, Raman's contribution was always disputed; thus in Russian scientific literature the effect is usually referred to as \\"combination scattering\\" or \\"combinatory scattering\\". Raman received the Nobel Prize in 1930 for his work on the scattering of light. In 1998 the Raman effect was designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society in recognition of its significance as a tool for analyzing the composition of liquids, gases, and solids. Instrumentation An early Raman spectrum of benzene published by Raman and Krishnan. Schematic of a dispersive Raman spectroscopy setup in a 180¬∞ backscattering arrangement. Modern Raman spectroscopy nearly always involves the use of lasers as an exciting light source. Because lasers were not available until more than three decades after the discovery of the effect, Raman and Krishnan used a mercury lamp and photographic plates to record spectra. Early spectra took hours or even days to acquire due to weak light sources, poor sensitivity of the detectors and the weak Raman scattering cross-sections of most materials. The most common modern detectors are charge- coupled devices (CCDs). Photodiode arrays and photomultiplier tubes were common prior to the adoption of CCDs.  Theory  The following focuses on the theory of normal (non-resonant, spontaneous, vibrational) Raman scattering of light by discrete molecules. X-ray Raman spectroscopy is conceptually similar but involves excitation of electronic, rather than vibrational, energy levels. =Molecular vibrations= Raman scattering generally gives information about vibrations within a molecule. In the case of gases, information about rotational energy can also be gleaned. For solids, phonon modes may also be observed. The basics of infrared absorption regarding molecular vibrations apply to Raman scattering although the selection rules are different. Degrees of freedom For any given molecule, there are a total of 3 degrees of freedom, where N is the number of atoms. This number arises from the ability of each atom in a molecule to move in three dimensions.Keith J. Laidler and John H. Meiser, Physical Chemistry (Benjamin/Cummings 1982), pp.646-7 When dealing with molecules, it is more common to consider the movement of the molecule as a whole. Consequently, the 3 degrees of freedom are partitioned into molecular translational, rotational, and vibrational motion. Three of the degrees of freedom correspond to translational motion of the molecule as a whole (along each of the three spatial dimensions). Similarly, three degrees of freedom correspond to rotations of the molecule about the x, y, and z-axes. Linear molecules only have two rotations because rotations along the bond axis do not change the positions of the atoms in the molecule. The remaining degrees of freedom correspond to molecular vibrational modes. These modes include stretching and bending motions of the chemical bonds of the molecule. For a linear molecule, the number of vibrational modes is 3-5, whereas for a non-linear molecule the number of vibrational modes is 3-6. Vibrational energy Molecular vibrational energy is known to be quantized and can be modeled using the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) approximation or a Dunham expansion when anharmonicity is important. The vibrational energy levels according to the QHO are :E_n = h \\\\left( n + {1 \\\\over 2 } \\\\right) u=h\\\\left( n + {1 \\\\over 2 } \\\\right) {1\\\\over {2 \\\\pi}} \\\\sqrt{k \\\\over m} \\\\\\\\!, where n is a quantum number. Since the selection rules for Raman and infrared absorption generally dictate that only fundamental vibrations are observed, infrared excitation or Stokes Raman excitation results in an energy change of E=h u={h\\\\over {2 \\\\pi}} \\\\sqrt{k \\\\over m} The energy range for vibrations is in the range of approximately 5 to 3500 cm‚àí1. The fraction of molecules occupying a given vibrational mode at a given temperature follows a Boltzmann distribution. A molecule can be excited to a higher vibrational mode through the direct absorption of a photon of the appropriate energy, which falls in the terahertz or infrared range. This forms the basis of infrared spectroscopy. Alternatively, the same vibrational excitation can be produced by an inelastic scattering process. This is called Stokes Raman scattering, by analogy with the Stokes shift in fluorescence discovered by George Stokes in 1852, with light emission at longer wavelength (now known to correspond to lower energy) than the absorbed incident light. Conceptually similar effects can be caused by neutrons or electrons rather than light. An increase in photon energy which leaves the molecule in a lower vibrational energy state is called anti-Stokes scattering. =Raman scattering= Raman scattering is conceptualized as involving a virtual electronic energy level which corresponds to the energy of the exciting laser photons. Absorption of a photon excites the molecule to the imaginary state and re-emission leads to Raman or Rayleigh scattering. In all three cases the final state has the same electronic energy as the starting state but is higher in vibrational energy in the case of Stokes Raman scattering, lower in the case of anti-Stokes Raman scattering or the same in the case of Rayleigh scattering. Normally this is thought of in terms of wavenumbers, where \\\\tilde{ u}_0 is the wavenumber of the laser and \\\\tilde{ u}_M is the wavenumber of the vibrational transition. Thus Stokes scattering gives a wavenumber of \\\\tilde{ u}_0 - \\\\tilde{ u}_M while \\\\tilde{ u}_0 + \\\\tilde{ u}_M is given for anti-Stokes. When the exciting laser energy corresponds to an actual electronic excitation of the molecule then the resonance Raman effect occurs, but that is beyond the scope of this article. A classical physics based model is able to account for Raman scattering and predicts an increase in the intensity which scales with the fourth-power of the light frequency. Light scattering by a molecule is associated with oscillations of an induced electric dipole. The oscillating electric field component of electromagnetic radiation may bring about an induced dipole in a molecule which follows the alternating electric field which is modulated by the molecular vibrations. Oscillations at the external field frequency are therefore observed along with beat frequencies resulting from the external field and normal mode vibrations. The different possibilities of light scattering: Rayleigh scattering (no exchange of energy: incident and scattered photons have the same energy), Stokes Raman scattering (atom or molecule absorbs energy: scattered photon has less energy than the incident photon) and anti-Stokes Raman scattering (atom or molecule loses energy: scattered photon has more energy than the incident photon) The spectrum of the scattered photons is termed the Raman spectrum. It shows the intensity of the scattered light as a function of its frequency difference ŒîŒΩ to the incident photons, more commonly called a Raman shift. The locations of corresponding Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks form a symmetric pattern around the RayleighŒîŒΩ=0 line. The frequency shifts are symmetric because they correspond to the energy difference between the same upper and lower resonant states. The intensities of the pairs of features will typically differ, though. They depend on the populations of the initial states of the material, which in turn depend on the temperature. In thermodynamic equilibrium, the lower state will be more populated than the upper state. Therefore, the rate of transitions from the more populated lower state to the upper state (Stokes transitions) will be higher than in the opposite direction (anti-Stokes transitions). Correspondingly, Stokes scattering peaks are stronger than anti-Stokes scattering peaks. Their ratio depends on the temperature, and can therefore be exploited to measure it: :\\\\frac{I_\\\\text{Stokes}}{I_\\\\text{anti-Stokes}} = \\\\frac{(\\\\tilde{ u}_0 - \\\\tilde{ u}_M)^4}{(\\\\tilde{ u}_0 + \\\\tilde{ u}_M)^4}\\\\exp \\\\left(\\\\frac{hc \\\\,\\\\tilde{ u}_M}{k_BT}\\\\right) =Selection rules= In contrast to IR spectroscopy, where there is a requirement for a change in dipole moment for vibrational excitation to take place, Raman scattering requires a change in polarizability. A Raman transition from one state to another is allowed only if the molecular polarizability of those states is different. For a vibration, this means that the derivative of the polarizability with respect to the normal coordinate associated to the vibration is non-zero: \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\alpha}{\\\\partial Q} e 0. In general, a normal mode is Raman active if it transforms with the same symmetry of the quadratic forms (x^2, y^2, z^2, xy, xz, yz), which can be verified from the character table of the molecule's point group. As with IR spectroscopy, only fundamental excitations (\\\\Delta u=\\\\pm1) are allowed according to the QHO. There are however many cases where overtones are observed. The rule of mutual exclusion, which states that vibrational modes cannot be both IR and Raman active, applies to certain molecules. The specific selection rules state that the allowed rotational transitions are \\\\Delta J=\\\\pm2, where J is the rotational state. This generally is only relevant to molecules in the gas phase where the Raman linewidths are small enough for rotational transitions to be resolved. A selection rule relevant only to ordered solid materials states that only phonons with zero phase angle can be observed by IR and Raman, except when phonon confinement is manifest. =Symmetry and polarization= Monitoring the polarization of the scattered photons is useful for understanding the connections between molecular symmetry and Raman activity which may assist in assigning peaks in Raman spectra. Light polarized in a single direction only gives access to some Raman‚Äìactive modes, but rotating the polarization gives access to other modes. Each mode is separated according to its symmetry. The symmetry of a vibrational mode is deduced from the depolarization ratio , which is the ratio of the Raman scattering with polarization orthogonal to the incident laser and the Raman scattering with the same polarization as the incident laser: \\\\rho = \\\\frac{I_r}{I_u} Here I_r is the intensity of Raman scattering when the analyzer is rotated 90 degrees with respect to the incident light's polarization axis, and I_u the intensity of Raman scattering when the analyzer is aligned with the polarization of the incident laser. When polarized light interacts with a molecule, it distorts the molecule which induces an equal and opposite effect in the plane-wave, causing it to be rotated by the difference between the orientation of the molecule and the angle of polarization of the light wave. If \\\\rho \\\\geq \\\\frac{3}{4}, then the vibrations at that frequency are depolarized; meaning they are not totally symmetric.  Stimulated Raman scattering and Raman amplification  The Raman-scattering process as described above takes place spontaneously; i.e., in random time intervals, one of the many incoming photons is scattered by the material. This process is thus called spontaneous Raman scattering. On the other hand, stimulated Raman scattering can take place when some Stokes photons have previously been generated by spontaneous Raman scattering (and somehow forced to remain in the material), or when deliberately injecting Stokes photons (\\"signal light\\") together with the original light (\\"pump light\\"). In that case, the total Raman-scattering rate is increased beyond that of spontaneous Raman scattering: pump photons are converted more rapidly into additional Stokes photons. The more Stokes photons that are already present, the faster more of them are added. Effectively, this amplifies the Stokes light in the presence of the pump light, which is exploited in Raman amplifiers and Raman lasers. Stimulated Raman scattering is a nonlinear optical effect. It can be described using a third-order nonlinear susceptibility \\\\chi^{(3)}. = Requirement for space-coherence = Suppose that the distance between two points A and B of an exciting beam is . Generally, as the exciting frequency is not equal to the scattered Raman frequency, the corresponding relative wavelengths and are not equal. Thus, a phase-shift appears. For , the scattered amplitudes are opposite, so that the Raman scattered beam remains weak. * A crossing of the beams may limit the path . Several tricks may be used to get a larger amplitude: * In an optically anisotropic crystal, a light ray may have two modes of propagation with different polarizations and different indices of refraction. If energy may be transferred between these modes by a quadrupolar (Raman) resonance, phases remain coherent along the whole path, transfer of energy may be large. It is an Optical parametric generation. * Light may be pulsed, so that beats do not appear. In Impulsive Stimulated Raman Scattering (ISRS), the length of the pulses must be shorter than all relevant time constants. Interference of Raman and incident lights is too short to allow beats, so that it produces a frequency shift roughly, in best conditions, inversely proportional to the cube of the pulse length. In labs, femtosecond laser pulses must be used because the ISRS becomes very weak if the pulses are too long. Thus ISRS cannot be observed using nanosecond pulses making ordinary time-incoherent light. Inverse Raman effect The inverse Raman effect is a form of Raman scattering first noted by W. J. Jones and B.P. Stoicheff. In some circumstances, Stokes scattering can exceed anti-Stokes scattering; in these cases the continuum (on leaving the material) is observed to have an absorption line (a dip in intensity) at ŒΩL+ŒΩM. This phenomenon is referred to as the inverse Raman effect; the application of the phenomenon is referred to as inverse Raman spectroscopy, and a record of the continuum is referred to as an inverse Raman spectrum. In the original description of the inverse Raman effect, the authors discuss both absorption from a continuum of higher frequencies and absorption from a continuum of lower frequencies. They note that absorption from a continuum of lower frequencies will not be observed if the Raman frequency of the material is vibrational in origin and if the material is in thermal equilibrium. = Supercontinuum generation = For high-intensity continuous wave (CW) lasers, stimulated Raman scattering can be used to produce a broad bandwidth supercontinuum. This process can also be seen as a special case of four-wave mixing, wherein the frequencies of the two incident photons are equal and the emitted spectra are found in two bands separated from the incident light by the phonon energies. The initial Raman spectrum is built up with spontaneous emission and is amplified later on. At high pumping levels in long fibers, higher-order Raman spectra can be generated by using the Raman spectrum as a new starting point, thereby building a chain of new spectra with decreasing amplitude. The disadvantage of intrinsic noise due to the initial spontaneous process can be overcome by seeding a spectrum at the beginning, or even using a feedback loop as in a resonator to stabilize the process. Since this technology easily fits into the fast evolving fiber laser field and there is demand for transversal coherent high-intensity light sources (i.e., broadband telecommunication, imaging applications), Raman amplification and spectrum generation might be widely used in the near-future. Applications Raman spectroscopy employs the Raman effect for substances analysis. The spectrum of the Raman-scattered light depends on the molecular constituents present and their state, allowing the spectrum to be used for material identification and analysis. Raman spectroscopy is used to analyze a wide range of materials, including gases, liquids, and solids. Highly complex materials such as biological organisms and human tissue can also be analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. For solid materials, Raman scattering is used as a tool to detect high-frequency phonon and magnon excitations. Raman lidar is used in atmospheric physics to measure the atmospheric extinction coefficient and the water vapour vertical distribution. Stimulated Raman transitions are also widely used for manipulating a trapped ion's energy levels, and thus basis qubit states. Raman spectroscopy can be used to determine the force constant and bond length for molecules that do not have an infrared absorption spectrum. Raman amplification is used in optical amplifiers. The Raman effect is also involved in producing the appearance of the blue sky (see Rayleigh Scattering: 'Rayleigh scattering of molecular nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere includes elastic scattering as well as the inelastic contribution from rotational Raman scattering in air'). Raman spectroscopy has been used to chemically image small molecules, such as nucleic acids, in biological systems by a vibrational tag.

Diplomatic Record Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan). The first was an alliance between Britain and Japan, signed in January 1902.Ian Nish, Anglo-Japanese Alliance: The Diplomacy of Two Island Empires 1984-1907 (1985) pp 203‚Äì228. The alliance was signed in London at Lansdowne House on 30 January 1902 by Lord Lansdowne, British foreign secretary, and Hayashi Tadasu, Japanese diplomat. A diplomatic milestone that saw an end to Britain's splendid isolation, the alliance was renewed and expanded in scope twice, in 1905 and 1911, before its demise in 1921 and termination in 1923.William Langer, The Diplomacy of Imperialism 1890‚Äì1902 (2nd ed. 1950), pp. 745‚Äì86. The main threat for both sides was from Russia. The threat of war with Britain prevented France from joining its ally Russia in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904. However, it angered the United States and some British dominions, which were hostile to Japan.Nish, Anglo- Japanese Alliance: The Diplomacy of Two Island Empires 1984-1907 (1985) pp 229‚Äì245. Motivations and reservations Tadasu Hayashi, Japanese signatory of the alliance The possibility of an alliance between Great Britain and Japan had been canvassed since 1895, when Britain refused to join the Triple Intervention of France, Germany and Russia against the Japanese occupation of the Liaodong Peninsula. While this single event was an unstable basis for an alliance, the case was strengthened by the support Britain had given Japan in its drive towards modernisation and their co-operative efforts to put down the Boxer Rebellion.G. W. Monger, \\"The End of Isolation: Britain, Germany and Japan, 1900‚Äì1902.\\" Transactions of the Royal Historical Society 13 (1963): 103‚Äì121. Newspapers of both countries voiced support for such an alliance; in Britain, Francis Brinkley of The Times and Edwin Arnold of the Telegraph were the driving force behind such support, while in Japan the pro-alliance mood of politician ≈åkuma Shigenobu stirred the Mainichi and Yomiuri newspapers into pro-alliance advocacy. The 1894 Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation had also paved the way for equal relations and the possibility of an alliance.Zara S. Steiner, \\"Great Britain and the Creation of the Anglo- Japanese Alliance.\\" Journal of Modern History 31.1 (1959): 27‚Äì36. onlinme In the end, the common interest truly fuelling the alliance was opposition to Russian expansion. This was made clear as early as the 1890s, when the British diplomat Cecil Spring Rice identified that Britain and Japan working in concert was the only way to challenge Russian power in the region. Negotiations began when Russia began to move into China. Nevertheless, both countries had their reservations. Britain was cautious about abandoning its policy of \\"splendid isolation\\", wary of antagonizing Russia, and unwilling to act on the treaty if Japan were to attack the United States. There were factions in the Japanese government that still hoped for a compromise with Russia, including the highly powerful political figure Hirobumi It≈ç, who had served four terms as Prime Minister of Japan. It was thought that friendship within Asia would be more amenable to the US, which was uncomfortable with the rise of Japan as a power. Furthermore, Britain was unwilling to protect Japanese interests in Korea and likewise, the Japanese were unwilling to support Britain in India. Hayashi and Lord Lansdowne began their discussions on July 1901, and disputes over Korea and India delayed them until November. At this point, Hirobumi It≈ç requested a delay in negotiations in order to attempt a reconciliation with Russia. He was mostly unsuccessful, and Britain expressed concerns over duplicity on Japan's part, so Hayashi hurriedly re- entered negotiations in 1902. \\"Splendid isolation\\" was ended as for the first time Britain saw the need for a peace-time military alliance. It was the first alliance on equal terms between East and West.J.D. Harcreaves, \\"The Anglo- Japanese Alliance\\" History Today (April 1952) 2#4 pp. 252‚Äì258. Terms of the 1902 treaty Punch cartoon (1905) accompanied by a quote from Rudyard Kipling that appeared in the British press after the treaty was renewed in 1905 illustrates the positive light that the alliance was seen in by the British public. Commemorative postcard 1905 The treaty contained six articles: Article 1 *The High Contracting parties, having mutually recognised the independence of China and Korea, declare themselves to be entirely uninfluenced by aggressive tendencies in either country, having in view, however, their special interests, of which those of Great Britain relate principally to China, whilst Japan, in addition to the interests which she possesses in China, is interested in a peculiar degree, politically as well as commercially and industrially in Korea, the High Contracting Parties recognise that it will be admissible for either of them to take such measures as may be indispensable in order to safeguard those interests if threatened either by the aggressive action of any other Power, or by disturbances arising in China or Korea, and necessitating the intervention of either of the High Contracting Parties for the protection of the lives and properties of its subjects. Article 2 *Declaration of neutrality if either signatory becomes involved in war through Article 1. Article 3 *Promise of support if either signatory becomes involved in war with more than one Power. Article 4 *Signatories promise not to enter into separate agreements with other Powers to the prejudice of this alliance. Article 5 *The signatories promise to communicate frankly and fully with each other when any of the interests affected by this treaty are in jeopardy. Article 6 *Treaty to remain in force for five years and then at one years' notice, unless notice was given at the end of the fourth year. Articles 2 and 3 were most crucial concerning war and mutual defense. The treaty laid out an acknowledgment of Japanese interests in Korea without obligating Britain to help should a Russo-Japanese conflict arise on this account. Japan was not obligated to defend British interests in India. Although written using careful and clear language, the two sides understood the Treaty slightly differently. Britain saw it as a gentle warning to Russia, while Japan was emboldened by it. From that point on, even those of a moderate stance refused to accept a compromise over the issue of Korea. Extremists saw it as an open invitation for imperial expansion. Renewal in 1905 and 1911 Toyama Mitsuru honours Rash Behari Bose The alliance was renewed and extended in scope twice, in 1905 and 1911. This was partly prompted by British suspicions about Japanese intentions in South Asia. Japan appeared to support Indian nationalism, tolerating visits by figures such as Rash Behari Bose. The July 1905 renegotiations allowed for Japanese support of British interests in India and British support for Japanese progress into Korea. By November of that year, Korea was a Japanese protectorate, and in February 1906 It≈ç Hirobumi was posted as the Resident-General to Seoul. At the renewal in 1911, Japanese diplomat Komura Jutar≈ç played a key role to restore Japan's tariff autonomy.Robert Joseph Gowen, \\"British Legerdemain at the 1911 Imperial Conference: The Dominions, Defense Planning, and the Renewal of the Anglo- Japanese Alliance.\\" Journal of Modern History 52.3 (1980): 385‚Äì413 online.

The alliance was announced on 12 February 1902.Sydney Morning Herald, 13 February 1902. In response, Russia sought to form alliances with France and Germany, which Germany declined. On 16 March 1902, a mutual pact was signed between France and Russia. China and the United States were strongly opposed to the alliance. Nevertheless, the nature of the Anglo-Japanese alliance meant that France was unable to come to Russia's aid in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 as this would have meant going to war with Britain. Nisshin of the Imperial Japanese Navy, in the Mediterranean (Malta, 1919). The alliance's provisions for mutual defence prompted Japan to enter the First World War on the British side. Japan attacked the German base at Tsingtao in 1914 and forced the Germans to surrender (see Siege of Tsingtao). Japanese officers aboard British warships were casualties at the Battle of Jutland in 1916.1916 newspaper casualty lists, Toronto Public Library. In 1917, Japanese warships were sent to the Mediterranean and assisted in the protection of allied shipping near Malta from U-boat attacks. A memorial at the Kalkara Naval Cemetery in Malta is dedicated to the 72 Japanese sailors who died in the conflict. The Treaty also made possible the Japanese seizure of German possessions in the Pacific north of the equator during the First World War, a huge boon to Japan's imperial interests. The Peacock Skirt, by Aubrey Beardsley, shows significant Japanese influence The alliance formed the basis for positive trading and cultural exchanges between Britain and Japan. Rapid industrialisation and the development of the Japanese armed forces provided significant new export opportunities for British shipyards and arms manufacturers. Japanese educated in Britain were also able to bring new technology to Japan, such as advances in ophthalmology. British artists of the time such as James McNeill Whistler, Aubrey Beardsley and Charles Rennie Mackintosh were heavily inspired by Japanese kimono, swords, crafts and architecture. Limitations There remained strains on Anglo-Japanese relations during the years of the alliance. One such strain was the racial question. Although originally a German notion, the Japanese perceived that the British had been affected by idea of Yellow Peril, on account of their recalcitrance in the face of Japanese imperial success. This issue returned at Versailles after the First World War when Britain sided with the U.S. against Japan's request of the addition of Racial Equality Proposal, proposed by Prince Kinmochi Saionji. The racial question was difficult for Britain because of its multi-ethnic empire. Another strain was the Twenty-One Demands which Japan made of China in 1915. This unequal treaty would have given Japan varying degrees of control over all of China, and would have prohibited European powers from extending their Chinese operations any further.

The demise of the alliance was signaled by the 1921 Imperial Conference, in which British and Dominion leaders convened to determine a unified international policy.Vinson, J. C. \\"The Imperial Conference of 1921 and the Anglo-Japanese alliance.\\" Pacific Historical Review 31, no. 3 (1962): 258 One of the major issues of the conference was the renewal of the Anglo‚ÄìJapanese Alliance. The conference began with all but Canadian Prime Minister Arthur Meighen supporting the immediate renewal of an alliance with Japan. The prevailing hope was for a continuance of the alliance with the Pacific power, which could potentially provide security for British imperial interests in the area.Vinson, J. C. \\"The Imperial Conference of 1921 and the Anglo-Japanese alliance,\\" 258. The Australians feared that they could not fend off any advances from the Imperial Japanese Navy, and desired a continuance of the buildup of naval resources for a possible future conflict as they feared that an alliance with the United States (then in a state of post-war isolationism) would provide little protection.Brebner, J. B. \\"Canada, The Anglo-Japanese Alliance and the Washington Conference.\\" Political Science Quarterly 50, no. 1 (1935): 52 Meighen, fearing that a conflict could develop between Japan and the United States, demanded the British Empire remove itself from the treaty to avoid being forced into a war between the two nations. The rest of the delegates agreed that it was best to court America and try to find a solution that the American government would find suitable, but only Meighen called for the complete abrogation of the treaty.Vinson, J. C. \\"The Imperial Conference of 1921 and the Anglo-Japanese alliance.\\" Pacific Historical Review 31, no. 3 (1962): 257 The American government feared that the renewal of the Anglo‚ÄìJapanese Alliance would create a Japanese-dominated market in the Pacific, and close China off from American trade.Spinks, Charles N. \\"The Termination of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance.\\" Pacific Historical Review 6, no. 4 (1937): 324 These fears were elevated by the news media in America and Canada, which reported alleged secret anti-American clauses in the treaty, and advised the public to support abrogation.Spinks, Charles N. \\"The Termination of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance.\\" Pacific Historical Review 6, no. 4 (1937): 326. The press, combined with Meighen's convincing argument of Canadian fears that Japan would attack imperial assets in China, caused the Imperial Conference to shelve the alliance.Nish, Ian H. Alliance in Decline: A Study in Anglo-Japanese Relations 1908‚Äì23. (London: The Athlone Press, 1972), 334 The conference communicated their desire to consider leaving the alliance to the League of Nations, which stated that the alliance would continue, as originally stated with the leaving party giving the other a twelve-month notice of their intentions.Nish, Ian H. Alliance in Decline: A Study in Anglo- Japanese Relations 1908‚Äì23. (London: The Athlone Press, 1972), 337. The British Empire decided to sacrifice its alliance with Japan in favour of goodwill with the United States, yet it desired to prevent the expected alliance between Japan and either Germany or Russia from coming into being.Kennedy, Malcolm D.

(Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1969), 54 Empire delegates convinced America to invite several nations to Washington to participate in talks regarding Pacific and Far East policies, specifically naval disarmament.Nish, Ian H.

Alliance in Decline, 381 The Pacific powers of the United States, Japan, France and Britain would sign the Four-Power Treaty, and adding on various other countries such as China to create the Nine-Power Treaty. The Four-Power Treaty would provide a minimal structure for the expectations of international relations in the Pacific, as well as a loose alliance without any commitment to armed alliances.Nish, Ian H.

Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 06 Feb. 2012. Human blastomere characteristics In humans, blastomere formation begins immediately following fertilization and continues through the first week of embryonic development. About 90 minutes after fertilization, the zygote divides into two cells. The two-cell blastomere state, present after the zygote first divides, is considered the earliest mitotic product of the fertilized oocyte. These mitotic divisions continue and result in a grouping of cells called blastomeres. During this process, the total size of the embryo does not increase, so each division results in smaller and smaller cells. When the zygote contains 16 to 32 blastomeres it is referred to as a \\"morula.\\" These are the preliminary stages in the embryo beginning to form. Once this begins, microtubules within the morula's cytosolic material in the blastomere cells can develop into important membrane functions, such as sodium pumps. These pumps allow the inside of the embryo to fill with blastocoelic fluid, which supports the further growth of life. The blastomere is considered totipotent. That is, blastomeres are capable of developing from a single cell into a fully fertile adult organism. This has been demonstrated through studies and conjectures made with mouse blastomeres, which have been accepted as true for most mammalian blastomeres as well. Studies have analyzed monozygotic twin mouse blastomeres in their two-cell state, and have found that when one of the twin blastomeres is destroyed, a fully fertile adult mouse can still develop. Thus, it can be assumed that since one of the twin cells was totipotent, the destroyed one originally was as well. Relative blastomere size within the embryo is dependent not only on the stage of the cleavage, but also on the regularity of the cleavage amongst the cells. If the number of blastomeres in the cellular mass is even, then the sizes of the cells should be congruent. However, if the number of blastomeres in the cellular mass is not even, then the division should be asynchronous such that the sizes of the cells best support the mass's specific stage of differentiation. Blastomere size is typically considered uneven when one blastomere has a diameter over 25% larger than that of the other being compared.  Blastomere Differentiation  The division of blastomeres from the zygote allows a single fertile cell to continue to cleave and differentiate until a blastocyst forms. The differentiation of the blastomere allows for the development of two distinct cell populations: the inner cell mass, which becomes the precursor to the embryo, and the trophectoderm, which becomes the precursor to the placenta. These precursors typically appear when the blastomere differentiates into the 8- and 16-cell masses. During the 8-cell differentiation period, the blastomeres form adheren junctions, and subsequently polarize along the apical-basal axis. This polarization permanently changes the morphology of these cells, and starts the differentiation process. After this, the 8-cell blastomere mass begins to compact by forming tight junctions between themselves, and cytosolic components of the cell accumulate in the apical region while the nucleus of each cell moves to the basal region. The adhesive lateral junction is then formed, and the blastomere is flattened to establish the apical cortical domain. Once the transition begins to a 16-cell mass, the apical cortical domain disappears, but elements of polarity are preserved. This allows for approximately half of the blastomeres to inherit polar regions that can rebuild the apical cortical domain. The other blastomeres that differentiate, then, will become apolar. Polar blastomere cells that differentiate will move to an outer position in the developing blastocyst and show precursors for the trophectoderm, while the apolar cells will move to an inner position and begin developing into the embryo. The cells will then fully commit to their individual states in one of these two domains at the 32-cell stage. = Models of Differentiation = There are two main models for differentiation that determine which blastomere cells will divide into either the inner cell mass or the trophectoderm. The first conjecture is known as the \\"inside-outside model\\", and states that the cells differentiate based on their state in the 16-cell stage or later. This means that, under this model, blastomere cells do not differentiate based on cellular differences, but rather they do so because of mechanical and chemical stimuli based on where they are positioned at that time. The other, more widely accepted model is known as the \\"cell-polarity model\\". This model states that the orientation of the cleavage plane at the 8-cell and 16-cell stages determines their later differentiation. There are two main way in which blastomeres typically divide: symmetrically, meaning perpendicular to the apical-basal axis, or asymmetrically, meaning horizontal to the apical-basal axis. Many potential hypotheses and conjectures that attempt to explain why these cells orient themselves the way that they do. Some researchers have stated that early-dividing blastomeres tend to divide asymmetrically, while others have proposed that the orientation of 8-cell stage blastomeres is random and cannot be predicted on a larger scale. One study in particular states that the position of the nucleus in each blastomere can be used to indicate how the cell will divide: if the nucleus is in the apical region then the cell will likely divide symmetrically, while if the nucleus is located in the basal region then the cell will likely divide asymmetrically. Related disorders It is possible for errors to occur during this process of repetitive cell division. Common among these errors is for the genetic material to not be divided evenly. Normally, when a cell divides each daughter cell has the same genetic material as the parent cell. If the genetic material does not split evenly between the two daughter cells, an event called \\"nondisjunction\\" occurs. Since this event occurs in only one of the several cells that exist at this point, the embryo will continue to develop but will have some normal cells and some abnormal cells. The people are \\"mosaics\\" of normal and abnormal cells, so this disorder is called \\"numerical mosaicism\\". This mosaicism, especially of diploidy and polyploidy, can lead to the failure of cell cleavage and mitosis. When these necessary early cell divisions do not occur, the embryo can begin to form polyploid giant cancer cells that function very similarly to blastomere cells in order to grow and evolve in response to mechanical and chemical signals just like blastocyst precursors do. Studies have shown that these giant cancer cells are often also the genetic equivalent to somatic blastomeres. = Diagnostics = Oftentimes, clinicians and researchers will use blastomere biopsies in at-risk pregnant women as a way to test for genetic disorders. These biopsies are invasive, however, and have a major disadvantage when compared to other forms of invasive genetic testing in that only a few number of cells can be extracted at a time. Over time many specialists have switched to blastocyst biopsies, which provide a lower level of mosaicism, but blastomere biopsies can still be used for earlier-stage studies and genetic diagnostics.

The name derives from the Latin adjective palƒÅtƒ´nus, \\"relating to the palace\\", from the noun palƒÅtium, \\"palace\\".Collins Dictionary of the English Language, London, 1986Cassell's Latin Dictionary, ed. Marchant & Charles It thus implies the exercise of a quasi-royal prerogative within a county, that is to say a jurisdiction ruled by an earl, the English equivalent of a count. A duchy palatine is similar but is ruled over by a duke, a nobleman of higher precedence than an earl or count. The nobleman swore allegiance to the king yet had the power to rule the county largely independently of the king. It should therefore be distinguished from the feudal barony, held from the king, which possessed no such independent authority. Rulers of counties palatine created their own feudal baronies, to be held directly from them in capite, such as the Barony of Halton.Sanders, I.J., English Baronies: A Study of their Origin and Descent 1086‚Äì1327, Oxford, 1960. Sanders excludes \\"Lordships\\" such as the Barony of Halton which are situated within Counties Palatine from his lists of feudal baronies. County palatine jurisdictions were created in England under the rule of the Norman dynasty. On continental Europe, they have an earlier date. In general, when a palatine-type autonomy was granted to a lord by the sovereign, it was in a district on the periphery of the kingdom, at a time when the district was at risk from disloyal armed insurgents who could retreat beyond the borders and re-enter. For the English sovereign in Norman times this applied to northern England, Wales and Ireland. As the authority granted was hereditary, some counties palatine legally survived well past the end of the feudal period. History=Durham, Chester and Lancaster= Palatinates emerged in England in the decades following the Norman conquest, as various earls or bishops were granted palatine (\\"from the palace\\") powers, i.e. powers of a sort elsewhere exercised by the king. In some places this may have been in part a defensive measure, enabling local authorities to organise the defence of vulnerable frontier areas at their own discretion, avoiding the delays involved in seeking decisions from court and removing obstructions to the coordinated direction of local resources at the discretion of a single official. However, palatine powers were also granted over areas such as the Isle of Ely which were not near any frontier. Durham palatinate plaque. Palatine powers over Cheshire were acquired by the Earls of Chester, a title which has since 1254 been reserved for the heir apparent to the throne (apart from a brief tenure in 1264‚Äì5 by Simon de Montfort, who had seized control of government from Henry III). Chester had its own parliament, consisting of barons of the county, and was not represented in Parliament until 1543,Harris, B. E. (Ed.) (1979). page 98. while it retained some of its special privileges until 1830. Exceptional powers were also granted to the Bishops of Durham, who during the aftermath of the Norman conquest had been put in charge of secular administration in what became County Durham. The autonomous power exercised by these \\"prince-bishops\\" over the County Palatine of Durham was particularly enduring: Durham did not gain parliamentary representation until 1654, while the bishops of Durham retained their temporal jurisdiction until 1836. The bishop's mitre which crowns the bishop of Durham's coat of arms is encircled with a gold coronet which is otherwise used only by dukes, reflecting his historic dignity as a palatine earl. boundaries within England Palatine powers over Lancashire were conferred on the first Duke of Lancaster in 1351, at the same time as his promotion from the status of earl. This was only the second dukedom created in England, following that of Cornwall in 1337, which also became associated with palatine powers. The dukedom was united with the Crown on the accession of Henry IV in 1399, but the vast estates of the Duchy of Lancaster were never assimilated into the Crown Estate, continuing even today to be separately administered for the monarch as Duke of Lancaster. The rights exercised through the Duchy rather than the Crown included its palatine powers over Lancashire, the last of which were revoked only in 1873. In the county palatine of Lancaster, the loyal toast is to \\"the Queen, Duke of Lancaster\\". The king's writs did not run in these three palatine counties until the nineteenth centuryYates (1856), pp. 3‚Äì5.The Law Terms Act 1830 and, until the 1970s, Lancashire and Durham had their own courts of chancery.The Courts Act 1971, section 41 (See Court of Chancery of the County Palatine of Lancaster and Court of Chancery of the County Palatine of Durham and Sadberge) The appeal against a decision of the county court of a county palatine had, in the first instance, to be to the court of common of that county palatine.Jewett v Summons. The Law Journal For The Year 1825. Volume III. Court of King's Bench. Page 220. =Other counties palatine= At various times in history the following areas had palatinate status: Shropshire, Kent, the Isle of Ely, Hexhamshire in Northumberland, and, in Wales, the Earldom of Pembroke (until the passing of the Laws in Wales Act 1535). Although not formally categorised as a palatinate, in Cornwall many of the rights associated with palatinates were conferred on the Duke of Cornwall, a title created in 1337 and always held by the heir apparent to the throne. In the history of Wales in the Norman era, the term most often used is Marcher Lord, which is similar to, but not strictly the same as, a Palatine Lord. Nevertheless, a number of strictly Palatine jurisdictions were created in Wales. There were several palatine districts in Ireland of which the most notable were those of the Earls of Desmond and the Earls of Ormond in County Tipperary. The latter continued in legal existence until the County Palatine of Tipperary Act 1715. In Scotland, the earldom of Strathearn was identified as a county palatine in the fourteenth century, although the title of Earl of Strathearn has usually been merged with the crown in subsequent centuries and there is little indication that the status of Strathearn differed in practice from other Scottish earldoms. In the colonies, the historic Province of Avalon in Newfoundland was granted palatine status, as was Maryland under Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore.

It is part of the National Gallery of the Berlin State Museums. The museum building and its sculpture gardens were designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and opened in 1968. The gallery closed in 2015, for \\"several years\\" of renovation. Collection Pablo Picasso, 1909, Femme assise (Sitzende Frau), oil on canvas, 100 x 80 cm The collection features a number of unique highlights of modern 20th-century art. Particularly well represented are Cubism, Expressionism, the Bauhaus and Surrealism. The collection owns masterpieces of artists like Pablo Picasso, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Joan Mir√≥, Wassily Kandinsky and Barnett Newman. The design of the building, despite its large site, allows for the display of only a small part of the collection, and the displays are therefore changed at intervals. Architecture=Dimensions, specifications and materials= This interior view of the Neue Nationalgalerie's ground floor shows the play of light off the reflective floor, as well as the animated red LCD tracks on the ceiling. The plan of the Neue Nationalgalerie is divided into two distinct stories. The upper story serves as an entrance hall as well as the primary special exhibit gallery, totaling of space. It is elevated from street level and only accessible by three flights of steps. Though it only comprises a small portion of the total gallery space, the exhibition pavilion stands boldly as the building's primary architectural expression. Eight cruciform columns, two on each length placed so as to avoid corners, support a square pre-stressed steel roof plate 1.8 meters thick and painted black. An eighteen-meter cantilever allows for ample space between the gallery's glazed fa√ßade and eight supporting columns. Mies' office studied this cantilever extensively in various scaled models in order to ensure its structural stability as well as the seeming flatness of the roof plate. The floor-to-ceiling height reaches 8.4 meters, and the space is laid out on a 3.6-meter square dimensional grid. Black anodized aluminum \\"egg crates\\" fit within the grid house lighting fixtures, with air ducts suspended above. The lower story serves primarily as housing for the gallery's permanent collection, though it also includes a library, offices, and a shop and caf√©, and totals about of space. It is three-quarters below ground so as to allow for safe storage of the artwork, its sole glazed fa√ßade looking out on the museum's sloping sculpture garden and providing ample indirect interior lighting. A rooftop plaza further extends the museum's exhibition space. =Contemporaneous projects= In 1956, Jos√© M. Bosch, President of Ron Bacard√≠ y Compa√±√≠a approached Mies to commission the design of a new office space. He was particularly interested in a very open plan, and the relatively simple idea Mies came up with involved a square roof plate supported on each side by two columns. Though initial structural challenges had to be dealt with, the resulting pavilion typology became integral to Mies' architectural lexicon, in many ways the epitome of his universal conception of space. The Bacard√≠ Building was abandoned in September 1960 due to general political unrest in Cuba, but at the same time, two other museum commissions were brought to Mies' office. Georg Schaefer, a wealthy industrialist living in Schweinfurt approached Mies about the construction of a museum for his nineteenth-century art collection during the summer of 1960. A modest initial plan was drawn for the structure, but later that year Mies decided to reconfigure the unbuilt Bacard√≠ project to fit Schaefer's program as he wished to see it built. Consequently, a scaled-down model of the Bacard√≠ project this time rendered in steel rather than concrete was created. In March 1961, Mies also received a letter from the Senator for Building and Housing in Berlin, inviting him to build what was to be called the Neue Nationalgalerie, an exhibition space for the state's collection of early twentieth-century art. The two museum projects, though slightly different in scale, where to be essentially identical in form, both a version in steel of the original Barcard√≠ design. Though the Schweinfurt project never came to fruition, the reductive exercise of continual reconfiguration allowed for the perfection of Mies' expression in Berlin, and the Neue Nationalgalerie remains as the sole built form of the initial tripartite conception. =Aesthetic Importance= Much of Mies' syntactical development throughout the three building progression leading up to the Neue Nationalgalerie was prefigured in an earlier project for a Museum for a Small City. This project was published in a special May 1943 edition of Architectural Forum. In his publication, Mies describes a seemingly floating roof plane, suspended above a single clear-span space punctuated by equidistant columns. This project is now seen as a significant move on Mies' part toward the alleviation of interior space by both defining and minimizing structural enclosure, thus joining exterior and interior space in a meaningful way. The structure itself, a composite of little more than ground plane, support and roof, thus becomes the building. The aesthetic importance of the clear-span was directly related to Mies' conception of museum space in general, a \\"defining, rather than confining space\\". The completely open nature of the plan also serves to eliminate the barrier between art and community, simultaneously breaking down the reverence enacted by severely partitioned spaces and inviting interaction between viewer and art. The overall aesthetic affect is thus one of vitalizing liberation. This infinitely transformative capability and universality is also seen in Mies' buildings from the intervening years, namely the Farnsworth House in Plano, Illinois, and Crown Hall of the Illinois Institute of Technology campus. Various commentators have recognized the structure's ties to classical building, seeing it as a modern temple whose monumental simplicity evinces the immense skill behind its design and conception. =Criticism= Neue Nationalgalerie with Alexander Calder sculpture Interior view The ability of clearly articulated external structures to alleviate fa√ßades and create large- scale universal spaces required certain boldness on the part of the client. The ineffable expression of the Neue Nationalgalerie's entrance pavilion had certain logistical downsides. Its smooth granite flooring reflects the warm natural light that floods the space, creating hazy shadow and making curatorial efforts notoriously complicated. The singular expression of the pavilion space also relegated the lower story to a secondary position, presenting further difficulties for the display of artwork involving a lack of natural lighting and relatively pedestrian layout of viewing space. When asked later to renovate and expand the building's lower story, Mies refused, as to do so would destroy the perfect proportions of the temple above. He originally conceived of the entrance pavilion as a place for very large works, allowing for unencumbered visual interaction and for use of the piece as space element in itself. An early collage included in the May 1943 Architectural Forum article about Museum for a Small City includes Picasso's Guernica, along with other large, plane-like paintings. Yet smaller works had to be shown on moveable freestanding walls or hanging partitions, making a curator's ability to effectively differentiate spaces difficult. =Future renovation= The Neue Nationalgalerie has had no thorough modernization since its inauguration. In 2012 it was announced that British architect David Chipperfield will oversee a major renovation of the building. In a non-competitive selection process common for public contracts in Germany, his firm was chosen for the contract out of 24 architectural firms based on a two-stage negotiation process. The museum requires new security and fire technology and the shop and cafe will be renovated. The ‚Ç¨101 million renovation project started in 2015 and is expected to last three years, during which time the museum will be closed.Catherine Hickley (29 March 2012), David Chipperfield to Renovate Berlin‚Äôs Neue Nationalgalerie Bloomberg News. Original building elements, such as handrails and shelves, will be removed, restored and reinstalled in their previous locations. Meanwhile, the structural framework of the roof, which rests on eight steel beams, and the glass facade will be restored.Bernhard Schulz (22 January 2015), David Chipperfield promises to keep ‚Äòas much Mies as possible‚Äô at Neue Nationalgalerie The Art Newspaper.

In a number of countries, the term train hopping is used synonymously with freight hopping, which means riding on the outside of a freight train, while train surfing can be practiced on any type of train. This type of travelling can be dangerous and even life-threatening, because there is a risk of death or serious injury from falling off a moving train, electrocution from power supply (overhead catenary wire, current collectors, resistors, etc.), colliding with a railway infrastructure (bridges, tunnels, platforms, railway signals or other trains) while riding outside off structure gauge on the side or on the roof of a train, or unsuccessful attempts to jump on a moving train or off it. Today, the practice is forbidden by statutes on many railroads in the world. Despite this, it is still practiced, especially on those railroads where the trains are overcrowded.  History  An early horse-hauled rail car with passengers on its roof and foot boards Western Front, 1918. Soldiers cling on to the roofs and doors of a train already full of other troops. Crowded tram in Leningrad, 1933 Refugees on the roof of a train during the Partition of India, 1947 The phenomenon of riding on the outside of trains came with the appearance of the first railway lines. On a series of first railroads, riding on rooftops and footboards of trains was common, but over time, starting from the second half of the 19th century, with an increase in the sizes and speed of trains, passenger coaches began to be produced fully covered and insulated from streets with a placement of all passenger seats inside carriages in order to improve the safety of passengers and prevent people falling from a moving train. However, some individuals continued riding on the outside of trains to travel without having a ticket. In the United States, this became a common means of transportation following the American Civil War as the railroads began pushing westward, especially among migrant workers who became known as \\"hobos\\". It continued to be widely used by those unable to afford other transportation, especially during times of widespread economic dislocation such as the Great Depression. In the first half of the 20th century during the era of trams rising in Europe and USA, trams in some cities became overcrowded, so some passengers began a practice of riding on footboards, doors, couplers and sometimes on the roofs of trams. Also, train surfing often occurred in European countries during the war conflicts, especially during the First World War, Russian Civil War and World War II. Soldiers and refugees often traveled on the roofs of carriages due to lack of seats inside. In the mid-20th century, European and American railroad companies in many countries took measures to reduce overcrowding in cars and prevent riding outside of them, so the prevalence of train surfing in those countries decreased. However, in some countries of Southeast Asia and Africa with a high population density, the problem of overcrowding of different vehicles, including trains, grew rapidly, so train surfing in those countries became a widespread phenomenon. As an extreme hobby, train surfing firstly appeared in South Africa during the 1980s among teenagers from poor families, and then began to appear in other countries around the world. Teenagers as young as 13 were reported as train surfing in Rio de Janeiro in 1988. During the 1990s, train surfing on a commuter electric multiple unit train became popular in Europe among young people who live near railway lines. Train surfers climb on a high-speed Velaro RUS \\"Sapsan\\" electric multiple unit train. Riding between coaches of a high-speed Siemens Velaro train \\"Sapsan\\" In Germany, the practice of S-Bahn surfing was made popular during the 1990s. The phenomenon was forgotten until the millennium, but in 2005 it was rediscovered by a group of train surfers from Frankfurt, Germany. The leader of the crew who calls himself \\"the Trainrider\\" surfed the InterCityExpress, the fastest train in Germany. An Internet video claimed that he died a year later from an incurable form of leukemia, but later the Trainrider revealed in an interview that this video was made by a fan and the story of his death was a hoax. (English subtitles) In the Soviet Union during the 1980s, teens and youths sometimes surfed trams. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the practice of surfing on electric multiple unit trains appeared during the 1990s in Russia and some other post-Soviet countries due to economic crisis and growing of interest for extreme recreational activities among teens and youths, who live near the railroads. At the beginning of 21st century, they also began to surf subway trains in Moscow Metro and organized train surfing crews and web-communities. In the mid-2000s, a problem of frequent cancellation of commuter trains and crowding inside rail cars appeared in the Moscow region. In summer 2010, dozens of commuter trains were cancelled due to track repairs on the Moscow railway, so the crowding of trains and number of train surfers in Moscow region has risen dramatically. It was the first time when a train surfing became a wide phenomenon in modern Russian Railways and it caused a big scandal. Train surfing was mostly a teenager hobby before this. After the railroad reconstruction the situation became stable and the cases of roof riding among the ordinary passengers disappeared. However, roof riding became more popular among the teenagers, who began to create a community of train surfers and post videos on YouTube. Train surfers began to organize meetings and big-way surfing events on the outside of commuter, subway and local freight trains via the Internet. Russian train surfing fans began to call themselves \\"Zatseper\\" and also name their hobby \\"Zatseping\\" (from the Russian word \\"–ó–∞—Ü–µ–ø–∏—Ç—å—Å—è-Zatsepitsya\\" translated as \\"to catch on\\"). Train surfing became something like an extreme sport discipline for them. From the beginning of 2011, Russian train surfers made several rides on the outside of the high-speed Siemens Velaro train \\"Sapsan\\", the fastest train in Russia. In Indonesia, especially Greater Jakarta, large numbers of people train surf, especially since the late 1990s, as gridlock grips this metropolis of 30 million without a single metro system, and the city comes up with alternative transport such as car jockeys. Jakarta traffic is the most gridlocked in Southeast Asia, perhaps among the worst worldwide. It has built bus rapid transit, but with little success, as there is no separation from the heavy traffic. The tropical heat and urban heat island effect also makes the top the only place on the train with plenty of air circulation. Since 2013 the practice has been eliminated after the state railway company modernized the ticketing system, allowing ticket to be sold up to 90 days in advance, and including check in requirements along with increasing number of rolling stocks. On commuter services, stations are modernized by installing turnstile, implementing contactless payment and locking down the station. All non- commuter train now have passenger limit of 100 to 110% while previously a service could run at 200% or more capacity.  Current state  Tram surfing in Sarajevo 2010 Train surfing is a common and usual way to ride trains in countries such as India, Bangladesh and South Africa, where this type of riding by trains is compelled due to the high population density and severe overcrowding of trains. This practice is a serious issue in these countries where people have been killed or injured in numerous accidents. However, train surfing can occur in any area with trains and trams. Individuals may train- surf to avoid the cost of a ticket or as a recreational activity. With the creation of the internet, the practice of filming the act and posting online videos of it is on the increase worldwide. Train surfers can use social networks to find and communicate with each other and organize trips by trains in small groups. In countries where a big community of train surfers exists, they sometimes organize major events of riding on the outside of local trains, where dozens of riders participate. Some railroad workers, such as shunters or conductors, are often allowed to ride on exterior parts of trains during shunting operations, but with many limitations.

In 2015, 25 cases of injuries to minors were recorded (13 of them were fatal).\\"For 2016 in the central federal district 34 people were injured with 9 of these people dying from their injuries.In 2012 it was reported that dozens of people had been involved in accidents while train surfing in Russia in the past year. In a report on train surfing in Rio de Janeiro it says that in 1987 150 people died whilst train surfing and over 400 were injured with some being permanently paralyzed and 40 people died whilst train surfing in the first half of 1988. The same report on train surfing in Rio de Janeiro also states that the government company that runs the commuter lines had paid the equivalent of $700,000 in death and injury claims. In August 2000 there had been \\"over 100 fatalities in more than 200 registered accidents over the past 10 years\\" related to train surfing in Brazil. In Germany between 1989 and 1995 there were 41 train surfing accidents. 18 of these 41 accidents resulted in the person's death and the age range was from 13 to 25.In 2008, forty teenagers died in Germany because of train surfing. In Ukraine train surfing resulted in 38 people being injured and 16 being killed in 2016 while in 2015 48 people were injured with 18 cases resulting in death. In October 2018 it was reported that \\"...last year, 12 teenagers were killed hooking, this year already two.\\"  Prevention and punishments  Police arrest a train surfer on the Moscow Metro Train surfing is illegal on most railways in the world, with some exceptions. Many railroad companies usually take a zero tolerance policy to practice of riding on exterior parts of trains, and employ railway police and guards in an attempt to prevent the practice. Police officers and guards usually patrol the territory of large passenger stations and freight yards, and can arrest train surfers if they are spotted. In some countries, railway police can patrol the territory of railways in utility trucks, SUVs (\\"bullmobiles\\"), or even standard police cars. In countries where the practice of trains surfing occurs regularly, the police frequently organize raids in order to detect and remove surfers off the trains and arrest them. The most common form of penalty for train surfers is a fine, however, in some countries, such as the United States or Canada, train surfers can be not only fined, but imprisoned too. At least 87 people were arrested in the last four months of 2010 in Melbourne for offences relating to train surfing. In Russia, over 1000 train surfers were arrested at the Moscow Railway during ten months of 2011. In India, 153 people were prosecuted in a single day in June 2012 for train surfing on the Central Railway. = Deterrents = Fencing between the cars of a 81-717/714 train which prevents passengers from falling into the gap and also impedes climbing between them To reduce the practice of riding on the outside of trains, railway companies often place signs that warn about the dangers of train surfing. While there are no official numbers, the London Underground ran a public awareness campaign against \\"tube surfing\\". The Indonesian railway company, PT Kereta Api, has tried several methods to deter train surfers. Early methods included hosing those caught with red paint and placing barbed wire on train roofs. In 2012 the company began suspending concrete balls above the railway, a short distance from the stations. This method was criticised as being potentially lethal.

It formed in a volcanic eruption, which began without warning on the eastern side of Heimaey, in the Westman Islands, on 23 January 1973. The name means Hill of Fire in Icelandic. The eruption caused a major crisis for the island and nearly led to its permanent evacuation. Volcanic ash fell over most of the island, destroying around 400 homes, and a lava flow threatened to close off the harbour, the island's main income source via its fishing fleet. An operation was mounted to cool the advancing lava flow by pumping sea water onto it, which was successful in preventing the loss of the harbour. After the eruption, the islanders used heat from the cooling lava flows to provide hot water and to generate electricity. They also used some of the extensive tephra, fall-out of airborne volcanic material to extend the runway at the island's small airport and as landfill on which 200 new houses were built. Background Iceland is a region of frequent volcanic activity, due to its location astride the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where the North American and Eurasian Plates are moving apart, and also over the Iceland hotspot, which greatly enhances the volcanic activity. It is estimated that a third of all the basaltic lava erupted in the world in recorded history has been produced by Icelandic eruptions. Map of Heimaey after the eruption of Eldfell in January 1973 The Vestmannaeyjar (Westman Islands) archipelago lies off the south coast of Iceland, and consists of several small islands, all formed by eruptions in the Holocene epoch. Heimaey, the largest island in the group and the only inhabited one, also contains some material from the Pleistocene era. The most prominent feature on Heimaey before 1973 was Helgafell, a 200 meters (650 ft) high volcanic cone formed in an eruption about 5,000 years ago. The Vestmannaeyjar archipelago was settled in about 874 AD, originally by escaped Irish slaves belonging to Norse settlers on the mainland. These settlers gave the islands their name, Ireland being west of mainland Scandinavia. Although plagued by poor water supplies and piracy during much of its history, Heimaey became the most important center of the Icelandic fishing industry, having one of the few good harbors on the southern side of the country, and being situated in very rich fishing grounds. The eruption begins At about 20:00 on 21 January 1973, a series of small tremors began to occur around Heimaey. They were too weak to be felt by the residents of the island, but a seismic station away, near the mainland, recorded over 100 large tremors between 01:00 and 03:00 on 22 January that appeared to be emanating from south of Heimaey. The tremors continued at a reduced rate until 11:00 that day, after which they stopped until 23:00 that evening. From 23:00 until 01:34 on 23 January, seven tremors were detected that grew shallower and more intense, while the epicenter moved closer to the town of Vestmannaeyjar. The largest tremor measured 2.7 on the Richter scale. Small tremors are very common at plate boundaries, and nothing here indicated that they heralded a major eruption. The onset of the eruption was therefore almost entirely unexpected. At about 01:55 on 23 January, a fissure opened up on the eastern side of the island, barely a kilometre away from the centre of the town of Heimaey, approximately 200 metres (650 ft) east of Kirkjub√¶r (Church farm), where the island's church had once been located. The fissure rapidly extended from 300 metres to a length of , crossing the island from one shore to the other. Submarine activity also occurred just offshore at the northern and southern ends of the fissure. Spectacular lava fountaining 50 to 150 metres high occurred along the whole fissure, which reached a maximum length of about during the first few hours of the eruption, but activity soon became concentrated on one vent, about north of the old volcanic cone of Helgafell and just outside the eastern edge of the town. During the early days of the eruption, the rate of lava and tephra emission from the fissure was estimated to be 100 cubic metres per second (3,500 cubic feet per second), and within two days, the lava fountains had built a cinder cone over 100 metres (330 ft) high. The name initially given to the new volcano was Kirkjufell (Church Mountain), owing to its proximity to Kirkjub√¶r. This name was not adopted by the official Icelandic place-naming committee, who chose Eldfell (Fire Mountain) instead, despite local opposition. The fountains' Strombolian eruptions continued until 19 February, depositing thick tephra over the northern half of the island and adding to the cone until it was 200 metres (660 ft) high. The eruption column that caused the air fall \\"occasionally rose to 9,000 metres (30,000 ft), or nearly to the tropopause\\". Lava flows from the cone traveled north and east to produce a \\"continuously expanding lava delta\\" along the east coast of the island and into the harbor, where small explosions built up a diminutive island that was soon overtaken by the advancing delta. The first lavas erupted by Eldfell had a mugearitic chemical composition but within a few weeks the volcano was erupting less fractionated lavas which had a hawaiitic composition. Basalt volcanic bomb from Eldfell By early May, the lava flow was between and in height. It averaged more than and in some places was as much as thick. The flow carried off large blocks from the main cone that had broken off, as well as volcanic bombs. \\"The viscosity of the lava fragments ejected by the blasts was, for basalt, relatively high. Very little spatter was produced and scoria bombs sometimes broke up explosively in flight (presumably due to rapid vesiculation), and by rapid impact on landing.\\" The high viscosity led to a \\"massive, blocky aƒÅ lava flow which moved slowly but relentlessly toward the north, northeast, and east.\\" Volcanic gases were collected from several locations. Gases collected at sea along the submerged part of active eruptive fissure were dominantly carbon dioxide and gases from cooling submerged lava flows were about 70 percent hydrogen. (Richard & James, 1983) Poisonous gas was found at low areas on the eastern part of Vestmannaeyjar. A wall was constructed between the vent and town to divert the gas, and a long trench was excavated for the steam to escape. However, none of these measures were completely effective. (Richard & James, 1983) Evacuation In the early hours of the eruption, the Icelandic State Civil Defence Organisation evacuated the entire population of Heimaey, having previously developed evacuation plans for an emergency such as this. The evacuation was necessary because lava flows were already moving slowly into the eastern side of town, and the whole of the small island was threatened by the likelihood of heavy ash fall. Because of severe storms in the days before the eruption, almost the entire fishing fleet was in the harbour, a stroke of luck which greatly assisted the organisation of the rapid evacuation. The population was alerted to the situation by fire engines sounding their sirens, and gathered by the harbour with just the small amount of possessions they were able to carry. The first boats left for √ûorl√°ksh√∂fn at about 02:30, just half an hour after the start of the eruption. Most of the population left the island by boat. Fortunately, the lava flows and tephra fall did not at first affect the island's airstrip (Vestmannaeyjar Airport), and a few people who were unable to travel by boat were evacuated by air‚Äîprimarily the elderly and patients from the hospital. Planes were sent from Reykjav√≠k and Keflavik to help speed the process. Within six hours of the onset of the eruption, almost all of the 5,300 people of the island were safely on the mainland. A few people remained to carry out essential functions and to salvage belongings from threatened houses. Cattle, horses and sheep on the island were slaughtered. On the mainland, friends, relatives and strangers offered shelter and housing. By the end of the day, all 5,300 people were spread around cities and towns on the mainland. Destruction of houses, creation of land Houses buried by ash Houses close to the rift were soon destroyed by lava flows and tephra fall. A few days after the eruption began, the prevailing wind direction moved to the west, resulting in extensive tephra falls over the rest of the island, causing extensive property damage. Many houses were destroyed by the weight of the ash fall, but crews of volunteers working to clear the ash from roofs and board up windows saved many more. By the end of January, tephra covered most of the island, reaching 5 metres (16 ft) deep in places. Apart from falling ash, some houses were also burned down by fires caused by lava bombs, or overridden by advancing lava flows. By early February, the heavy tephra fall had abated, but lava flows began to cause serious damage. Submarine activity just north of the fissure severed an electric power cable and a water pipeline which supplied electrical power and water from the Icelandic mainland, and lava began to flow towards the harbour, a situation which caused serious concerns - if the harbour was destroyed, the island's fishing industry would be devastated. By early May, about 300 buildings had been engulfed by lava flows or gutted by fire and 60-70 homes had been buried by tephra.(Richard & James, 1983) As Heimaey was responsible for some 3% of Iceland's GNP, the effect on the whole country's economy would be significant. Efforts to prevent the loss of the harbour are described further below. A concrete water tank, partly crushed by lava Lava flows also moved into the sea east of the island, creating new land that would eventually add over to the island, and into the eastern parts of town, destroying several hundred houses. The flows were thick and blocky aƒÅ lava (Icelandic: apalhraun) flows, and covered the ground to average depths of about 40 metre (130 ft), reaching 100 metre (330 ft) thick in places. Later on in the eruption, a surge of lava destroyed one fish processing plant and damaged two others, and also demolished the town's power generating plant. Despite the eruption's close proximity to the town and the extensive property damage, only one fatality could be attributed to the eruption - a man who had broken into a chemist's store to acquire drugs was suffocated by toxic fumes. Carbon dioxide, with small amounts of poisonous gases, became concentrated in many buildings partially buried by tephra, and several other people were affected when entering these buildings. Efforts to mitigate the hazards presented by the accumulation of poisonous gas included the building of a large tephra wall to divert gases away from the town, and the digging of a trench to channel away the CO2 (carbon dioxide). These defences were only partially effective, as they relied on the assumption that the gases were produced at the vent, and flowed into the town from there. It is believed that as least some of the CO2 originated deep within the volcanic conduit and percolated through older volcanic rocks, rising directly into the town. Lava-cooling operations Steam rises copiously where seawater is being used to cool the flows The possibility of lava flows cutting off the harbour was the most significant threat facing the town. One contingency plan devised, should the harbour be closed off, was to cut through a low sand spit on the north side of the island to provide a new channel into the harbour, but it was hoped that if the lava flow could be slowed, this would not be necessary. Lava flows had been sprayed with water in attempts to slow them in Hawaii and on Mount Etna, but these had been rather small-scale operations with limited success. However, Professor √ûorbj√∂rn Sigurgeirsson carried out an experiment that proved that further advances of the lava could be impeded by prematurely solidifying the advancing lava-flow front.Lava-Cooling Operations During the 1973 Eruption of Eldfell Volcano, Heimaey, Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 97-724 The first attempt to slow the lava flow by spraying the leading edge with sea water began on 6 February, and although the volume of water being pumped on was rather small at 100 litres per second (26 US (liquid) gallons per second), the flow was noticeably affected. The lava changed as water poured on it. Before cooling, the flow of the lava was blocky, covered with volcanic bombs and was a reddish oxidised colour. After cooling, the surface became more jagged and was much more difficult to walk on, and the flow surface turned from black to grey. (Richard & James, 1983) Water cooling of the lava was slow but efficient, with almost all the water converted to steam. Once the viability of lava cooling had been proven, efforts to halt the flows were increased. The pumping capacity was increased in early March, when a large chunk of the crater wall broke away from the summit of Eldfell and began to be carried along the top of the lava flow towards the harbour. The chunk, dubbed Flakkarinn (The Wanderer), would have seriously threatened the viability of the harbour if it had reached it, and the dredging boat Sandey was brought in on 1 March to prevent its advance. Professor √ûorbj√∂rn Sigurgeirsson provided advice to the pumping crews on where to direct their efforts to most efficiently slow the flows. Eventually the Wanderer broke up into two pieces which both stopped approximately 100 metres (330 ft) from the harbour mouth. The ensuing lava-cooling operations were the most ambitious that had ever been undertaken. Sandey was able to spray up to 400 litres per second (105 US gallons per second) onto the advancing flow, and a network of pipes was laid on top of the lava to distribute the seawater over as wide an area as possible. Wooden supports for the pipes caught fire where the lava was hottest, and even aluminium supports melted, but the pipes themselves were prevented from melting by the cold seawater flowing through them. Up to 12,000 square metres (3 acres) of lava flow could be cooled at one time, with internal barriers then being created within the flow, which thickened and piled up upon itself. Water was pumped onto this lava flow to halt its advance down the street. The work involved in laying pipes over an active lava flow was highly dangerous, with low visibility due to the extensive emission of steam. Rough tracks were made onto the flow by bulldozing tephra, but these tracks quickly became very uneven and moved several metres a day. The pipelayers used bulldozers and walkie-talkies to advance through the steam to lay more pipes. The workers dubbed themselves 'The Suicide Squad', and managed to lay pipes up to 130 metres (430 ft) inward from the flow front, directly over the advance. Although several men sustained minor burns, no serious injuries were received. By the end of March, a fifth of the town had been covered by lava flows, and increased pumping capacity was required. Thirty-two pumps, each with a capacity of up to 1000 litres per second (265 US gallons per second), were brought in from the United States. After these pumps began to cool the flow advancing towards the town, its movement slowed dramatically and soon stopped. Failure of pump shafts became a problem after a few weeks, probably because they were designed for pumping oil rather than water, and new and improved shafts had to be manufactured in Reykjav√≠k and brought in. One notable feature of the lava cooling operation was the deposit of large amounts of salt where seawater was sprayed onto the lava. Large expanses of flow became encrusted with extensive white deposits, and it was estimated that up to 220,000 tonnes (240,000 short tons) of salt was deposited in total. Sigurgeirsson called these protective measures \\"undoubtedly the most extensive that have ever been used in a volcanic eruption\\" and said that \\"had it not been for the cooling, the lava tongue [into the harbor] could be expected to‚Ä¶extend further along its direction of movement‚Ä¶for a whole month longer than it actually did. It failed by only about 100 meters to block the entrance to the harbor\\". The cooling operation ended on 10 July 1973, and approximately 7,3 million cubic metres of seawater were pumped. This eruption was a special case where the method used to control the lava was suited to local conditions. Firstly, the initial eruption was only 1100 yards from the centre of town and harbour. Next, the flow of lava was slow and allowing time to plan and carry out control. Thirdly, sea water was available in its nearby harbour and lastly, it was easy to move pipes and pump equipment as the transport system by sea and road was good. (Richard & James, 1983) The entire operation cost a total of US$1,447,742 at the time. The eruption made headlines around the world when it began, and was covered constantly by Icelandic news crews throughout. In Europe, the eruption was one of the biggest news items while it continued, competing for front page space with breakthroughs then being made in the Vietnam War peace talks in Paris. The efforts of the islanders to halt the lava flows received particular attention, with coverage in publications such as National Geographic. The attention focused on the island as a result of the eruption led to a later upsurge in tourism once the eruption was over. The eruption dies down Development of the coastline of Heimaey during the eruption of Eldfell in 1973 The volume of lava being emitted during the eruption fell steadily after the first few days. From its initial rate of 100 cubic metres per second (3500 cubic feet per second), the emission rate fell to about 60 cubic metres per second (2100 cubic feet per second) by 8 February, and just 10 cubic metres per second (350 cubic feet per second) by the middle of March. The decline was slower after that, but by the middle of April the flow rate had fallen to about 5 cubic metres per second (180 cubic feet per second). Short-lived submarine activity was discovered by a fishing vessel on 26 May, about north-east of Heimaey and off the coast of the mainland. The eruption finally came to an end in early July, when flowing lava was no longer visible, although subsurface flows may have continued for a few days longer. Shortly before the end of the eruption, a tiltmeter 1150 metres (3750 ft) from the crater which had been measuring ground deformation throughout the eruption detected subsidence towards the crater, implying that the shallow magma chamber which had fed the eruption was emptying out. In total, the volume of lava and tephra emitted during the five-month eruption was estimated to be about 0.25 of a cubic kilometre (0.06 of a cubic mile). About of new land was added to the island, increasing its pre-eruption area by some 20%. In the end, the harbour entrance was narrowed considerably but not closed off, and the new lava flow acted as a breakwater, improving the shelter afforded by the harbour. Flakkarinn rafted several hundred metres towards the harbour along the top of the lava flow, but came to a halt well away from the water's edge. Heimaey since the eruption The street shown above, cleared of lava after the eruption A cross was placed at base of Eldfell after the eruption in 1973. By the end of 1975, the population of the Westman Islands had returned to roughly 85% of its pre-eruption level. 42% among those with destroyed houses did not return before the end of 1975, while the rate was only 27% among those whose houses were not destroyed. By 1974, fishing companies in the Westman Islands were back to normal production levels. Counter-intuitively, the new lava field actually improved the harbour in Westman Islands. Also counter-intuitive, the forced displacement had a large positive causal effect on both the earnings and education for those who were younger than 25 years old at the time of the eruption. The insides of lava flows can remain at temperatures of several hundred degrees for many years due to the very low thermal conductivity of rock. Following the end of the eruption, scientists began to assess the feasibility of extracting geothermal heat from the gradually cooling flows. Experimental heating systems were soon devised, and by 1974 the first house was connected. The scheme was extended to several more houses and the hospital, and in 1979 construction began of four larger plants to extract heat from the flows. Each plant extracted energy from a square 100 metres (330 ft) on each side, by percolating water down into the hot parts and collecting the resulting steam. Up to 40 megawatts (MW) of power could be generated by the plants, which also then supplied hot water to nearly every house on the island. Helgafell (left) and Eldfell (right) in 2006. The fissure from the 1973 eruption is visible running from the lower left to the center of the image. The tephra produced by the eruption was used to extend the runways at the island's small airport, and also as landfill on which 200 new homes were built. By mid-1974, about half the pre-eruption population had returned to the island, and by March 1975, about 80% had returned. The recovery and reconstruction of Heimaey was paid for by all Icelanders via a hypothecated sales tax, as well as through international aid totalling US$ 2.1 million primarily from Denmark but with substantial contributions from the United States and several international organisations. With the harbour improved by the new lava breakwater, the fishing industry regained its former vigour and the island today remains the most important fishing centre in the nation, as over a third of Iceland's total fish catch is from this harbour. By the end of the eruption, Eldfell stood about 220 metres (720 ft) above sea level. Since then, its height has dropped by 18 to 20 metres (60 to 65 feet), due to slumping and compacting of the unconsolidated gravelly tephra as well as wind erosion. The islanders have planted grass around the lower slopes of the otherwise bare hill, to stabilise it against further erosion, and eventually it is expected that most of the volcano will be covered by grass, as neighbouring Helgafell is. Eldfell is one of the best known volcanic eruptions in the world.

Originating in Sri Lanka, Nepal, and the west coast of India, this species grows to a maximum length of 4 inches (10 cm), making it one of the largest of the danionins. It is characterized by a blue and yellow, torpedo-shaped body with gray and clear fins. In the wild, giant danios live in clear streams and rivers among hills at elevations up to 1000 ft (300 m) above sea level. Their native substrate is small gravel. They are native to a tropical climate and prefer water with a 6-8 pH, a water hardness of 5.0-19.0 dGH, and a temperature range of 72-81 ¬∞F (22-27 ¬∞C). As surface dwellers, their diets consist predominantly of exogenous insects, but is also supplemented by worms and crustaceans. In captivity, giant danios will usually accept most foods. They are a somewhat aggressive fish, and may bully other fish in community tanks. Giant danios appreciate water movement to simulate the motion of the rivers and fast-moving streams of their origins, and prefer to school. Giant danios are also used as dither fish in South and Central American cichlid aquariums. The larger cichlids chase and defend their territories against the giant danios, which allows the cichlids to exhibit more natural behavior. As egg-scatterers, danios produce around 300 eggs in a single spawning. They spawn in clumps of plants. A so-called \\"golden giant danio\\", sometimes seen, is in reality a partial albino fish. Devario affinis, Devario browni, Devario malabaricus, and Devario strigillifer were originally deemed synonyms, but are now valid species.  Diet  The main component of giant danios' diet in the wild are flying insects.Gilpin D., Consultant: Schmid-Araya J.,2012. The Illustrated World Encyclopedia of Freshwater Fish and River Creatures. Anness Publishing. This diet is supplemented with aquatic invertebrates such as worms and crustaceans. In captivity giant danios feed on mosquito larvae, chironomous larvae, white worms, chopped earth worms, or commercially available pet food.Dey S., Ramanujam S. N., Mahapatra B. K., 2014. Breeding and development of ornamental hill stream fish Devario aequipinnatus (McClelland) in captivity. International Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Studies 1(4):01‚Äì07.  Habitat  Giant danios are found in fast- flowing streams, usually in hilly areas. Giant danios prefer shaded and clear water. They also prefer gravel or sand sediment. Giant danios are shoaling fish, meaning they are found in social groups.  Reproduction and lifecycle  Giant danio breeding can be induced in captivity. In captivity, breeding is induced by increasing water temperature and creating artificial rain. Juveniles begin to resemble their adult form after 65 days of development. Females are larger than males and also possess a more rounded abdomen. Males interested in spawning chase females and ram into their abdomens with their heads.  Distribution  Giant danios are native to the Indian subcontinent and most of Indochina. Their range runs from Pakistan to Cambodia.  Importance to humans  Giant danios are important in the aquarium trade. About 85% of Indian exports of giant danios are wild caught.

James Hansen Newman, Ph.D. (born October 16, 1956) is an American physicist and a former NASA astronaut who flew on four Space Shuttle missions.  Personal data  Newman was born on October 16, 1956, in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (now the Federated States of Micronesia), but considers Pacific Grove, California, to be his hometown. He is married to Mary Lee Pieper (now Mary Lee Newman) and has three children. His mother, Ms. Ruth Hansen, and his father, Dr. William Newman, are both residents of San Diego. Mary Lee's parents, Mr. & Mrs. Wylie Bernard Pieper, reside in Houston, Texas.  Education  Newman graduated from La Jolla High School, San Diego, California, in 1974; he received a Bachelor of Arts degree, cum laude, in Physics from Dartmouth College in 1978, a Master of Arts degree and a Doctorate in Physics from Rice University in 1982 and 1984, respectively.  Organizations  Newman is a member of the American Physical Society and Sigma Xi.  Special honors  Newman was awarded a Citation in Senior Thesis Research from Dartmouth College in 1978. Elected to Sigma Xi in 1980. He is the recipient of the 1982-83 Texaco Fellowship, the Sigma Xi Graduate Merit Award in 1985, and 1988 NASA Superior Achievement Award. Newman was selected by NASA Johnson Space Center to attend the 1989 summer session of the International Space University in Strasbourg, France. Newman was awarded the 1995 Superior Achievement Award by the Institute of Navigation for \\"outstanding accomplishments as a Practical Navigator\\" for his work on GPS (Global Positioning System) on the Space Shuttle. In 1996 he received the NASA Exceptional Service Medal. He is the recipient of the American Astronautical Society Flight Achievement Award (1994, 1999) for his work as a member of the STS-51 and STS-88 crews. As the leader of the Space Vision System Development Team, Newman shared the 2001 Rotary National Award for Space Achievement Foundation's Team Award and shared a 2002 NASA Group Achievement Award to the Space Vision System Team.  NASA career  After graduating from Rice University in 1984, Newman did an additional year of post-doctoral work at Rice. His research interests are in atomic and molecular physics, specifically medium to low energy collisions of atoms and molecules of aeronomic interest. His doctoral work at Rice University was in the design, construction, testing, and use of a new position-sensitive detection system for measuring differential cross sections of collisions of atoms and molecules. In 1985, Dr. Newman was appointed as adjunct professor in the Department of Space Physics and Astronomy at Rice University. That same year he came to work at NASA‚Äôs Johnson Space Center, where his duties included responsibility for conducting flight crew and flight control team training for all mission phases in the areas of Orbiter propulsion, guidance, and control. He was working as a simulation supervisor when selected for the astronaut program. In that capacity, he was responsible for a team of instructors conducting flight controller training. Selected by NASA in January 1990, Newman began astronaut training in July 1990. His technical assignments since then include: Astronaut Office Mission Support Branch where he was part of a team responsible for crew ingress/strap-in prior to launch and crew egress after landing; Mission Development Branch working on the Shuttle on-board laptop computers; Chief of the Computer Support Branch in the Astronaut Office, responsible for crew involvement in the development and use of computers on the Space Shuttle and Space Station. Detailed to the Space Shuttle Program Office in March 1999 for a two-year tour of duty, Newman served as the RMS Integration Manager responsible for the Orbiter robotic arm and the Space Vision System. He flew as a mission specialist on STS-51 (1993), STS-69 (1995), STS-88 (1998) and STS-109 (2002). A veteran of four space flights, Dr. Newman has logged over 43 days in space, including six spacewalks totaling 43 hours and 13 minutes. If Dr. Newman could do it all over again, he really wishes he could fly on an ISS Expedition like fellow astronaut classmate Dan Bursch. Effective December 1, 2002, Newman served as NASA's Director, Human Space Flight Programs, Russia. As NASA's lead representative to the Russian Aviation and Space Agency (Rosaviakosmos) and its contractors, his role is to continue oversight of all human space flight operations, logistics, and technical functions, including NASA's mission operations in Korolev and crew training at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City. While still assigned to the Astronaut Office Newman has also worked in various assignments at NASA. Detailed to the Space Shuttle Program Office from March 1999 to March 2001, Newman served as the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) Integration Manager responsible for the Orbiter Canadian robotic arm and the Space Vision System. Newman was detailed to the International Space Station (ISS) Program Office from December 2002 through January 2006, serving as NASA's Director, Human Space Flight Program, Russia. As the ISS Program Manager's lead representative to the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roskosmos) and its contractors, his responsibilities included oversight of NASA's human space flight program in Russia. This included NASA operations, logistics, and technical functions in Moscow, at NASA's Mission Control Center operations in Korolev, and NASA's crew training at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City. In March 2006, Newman was detailed to the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey, California, as a NASA Visiting Professor in the NPS Space Systems Academic Group. Newman left NASA in July 2008 to accept a position as Professor, Space Systems at NPS to continue his involvement in teaching and research, with an emphasis on using very small satellites in hands-on education and for focused research projects of national interest. = Space flight experience = STS-51 Discovery, (September 12‚Äì22, 1993) was launched from and returned to make the first night landing at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. During the ten-day flight, the crew of five deployed the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) and the Orbiting and Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer on the Shuttle Pallet Satellite (ORFEUS/SPAS). Newman was responsible for the operation of the SPAS, was the backup operator for the RMS, and on flight day five conducted a seven-hour-five-minute spacewalk with Carl Walz. The extravehicular activity (EVA) tested tools and techniques for use on future missions. In addition to working with numerous secondary payloads and medical test objectives, the crew successfully tested a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to determine real-time Shuttle positions and velocities and completed a test routing Orbiter data to on-board laptop computers. STS-51 made 158 orbits of the Earth, traveling 4.1 million miles in 236 hours and 11 minutes. STS-69 Endeavour (September 7‚Äì18, 1995), was an eleven-day mission during which the crew successfully deployed and retrieved a SPARTAN satellite and the Wake Shield Facility (WSF). Also on board was the International Extreme Ultraviolet Hitchhiker payload, numerous secondary payloads, and medical experiments. Newman was responsible for the crew's science involvement with the WSF and was also the primary RMS operator on the flight, performing the WSF and EVA RMS operations. He also operated the on- orbit tests of the Ku-band Communications Adaptor, the Relative GPS experiment, and the RMS Manipulator Positioning Display. The mission was accomplished in 171 Earth orbits, traveling 4.5 million miles in 260 hours, 29 minutes. James H. Newman on STS-88 with Sergei Krikalyov on the right STS-88 Endeavour (December 4‚Äì15, 1998), was the first International Space Station assembly mission. During the twelve-day mission the Unity Module was mated with the Zarya Module. Newman performed three spacewalks with Jerry Ross, totaling 21 hours, 22 minutes. The primary objective of the spacewalks was to connect external power and data umbilicals between Zarya and Unity. Other objectives include setting up the Early Communication antennas, deploying antennas on Zarya that had failed to deploy as expected, installing a sunshade to protect an external computer, installing translation aids, and attaching tools/hardware for use in future EVAs. The crew also performed IMAX Cargo Bay Camera (ICBC) operations, and deployed two satellites, Mighty Sat 1, sponsored by the Air Force, and SAC-A, from Argentina. The mission was accomplished in 185 orbits of the Earth, traveling 4.6 million miles in 283 hours and 18 minutes. STS-109 Columbia (March 1‚Äì12, 2002). STS-109 was the fourth Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing mission and the 108th flight of the Space Shuttle. The crew of STS-109 successfully upgraded the Hubble Space Telescope with new solar arrays, a new power control unit, and a new camera, and also installed a cooler to reactivate an old infrared camera. This work was accomplished during a total of five spacewalks in five consecutive days. Dr. Newman performed two spacewalks with crewmate Mike Massimino, totaling 14 hours and 46 minutes. During the first of these spacewalks, Newman and Massimino replaced an old solar array and a reaction wheel assembly with new units. During their second spacewalk they replaced the old Faint Object Camera with the state-of-the-art Advanced Camera for Surveys, expected to produce a tenfold increase in Hubble's capability. STS-109 orbited the Earth 165 times, traveling 3.9 million miles in 262 hours and 10 minutes.

Early life  He studied mathematics at the University of Tokyo, receiving a B.S. in 1966 and an M.S. in 1968. He continued his studies under John Milnor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, earning his PhD in mathematics in 1970. He took teaching jobs at a series of universities: State University of New York at Stony Brook (1970), Tufts University (1972‚Äì1986), and Hiroshima Shudo University (1986‚Äì1997). His research was on topology, with an interest in homotopy groups. While at Tufts, Akiba established the Hibakusha Travel Grant program, which brought several American print and broadcast journalists annually to Hiroshima in August, to craft stories about the city (and typically about the experiences of those exposed to the atomic bomb in 1945). Political career As a member of the Social Democratic Party, he was elected to the House of Representatives, and served from 1990 to 1999. He assumed office as mayor of Hiroshima in February, 1999, and was reelected to this position in 2003 and in April 2007. Peace activities As mayor, he has been a visible peace activist. He is active in the Mayors for Peace organization, serving as the president of their World Conference. The 2020 Vision Campaign launched in 2003, which aims to eliminate nuclear weapons, has earned Mayors for Peace the \\"World Citizenship Award\\" from the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation in 2004, the \\"Sean McBride\\" Award from the International Peace Bureau in 2006, and the Nuclear-Free Future Award from the Franz-Moll Foundation in 2007. He has also been an advocate of the abolition of nuclear weapons, and a vocal critic of George W. Bush. Since May 2007 he is also Councillor at the World Future Council. In 2007 he received the Nuclear-Free Future Award in the solutions category. He was longlisted for the 2008 World Mayor award, but failed to win, as the award went to Mayor Helen Zille of Cape Town, Republic of South Africa. On January 21, 2010, he attended the 78th winter meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors as a special guest speaker, and in that capacity attended the reception held at the White House and met US President Barack Obama. He is so far the only serving Mayor of Hiroshima who has officially met a serving US President. In August 2010, he received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for his advocacy for nuclear disarmament, and in April 2013 he was awarded the Otto Hahn Peace Medal from the United Nations Association of Germany (DGVN) and the Governing Mayor of Berlin. Akiba is on the Board of Advisors of the Global Security Institute. Hiroshima is one place outside the United States where Martin Luther King Jr. Day is observed with equal importance as in the United States. Tadatoshi Akiba holds a special banquet at the mayor's office as an act of unifying his city's call for peace with King's message of human rights. Stepping down as mayor In the new year address on January 4, 2011, Akiba announced he would not run for reelection during the mayoral election scheduled for April 10, 2011. No reasons were given. In early April it was reported that Hiroshima University has appointed Akiba as special professor, effective from his retirement as mayor. On April 10, Kazumi Matsui was elected the new Mayor. On August 3, 2012, he was appointed chairman of the Middle Powers Initiative (MPI), an international network of non-governmental organizations working for nuclear disarmament.

He performed a solo recital at Carnegie Hall in 1973 as a winner of the Concert Artists Guild competition. He has edited the saxophone and piano reduction of the Ingolf Dahl Concerto for Saxophone and Band based on his work with Dahl during his studies at the University of Southern California. His version of the Concerto is the standard version of this piece played today, and has performed the piece under Dahl, as well as Michael Tilson Thomas and Zubin Mehta. Mr. Pittel has performed with many major orchestras including the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Louisville Orchestra, Boston Symphony, New York Philharmonic, San Antonio Symphony, and Austin Symphony. Complete Biography from the Saxophone Journal There are few saxophone masters in the modern world, and even fewer who compare to Harvey Pittel. For Pittel, the title ‚Äúmaster‚Äù is an appropriately well-earned and well-deserved description. The critics of the United States agree. The New York Times‚Äô Raymond Ericson wrote, in regard to one of Pittel‚Äôs many New York concerts, that the music he heard was ‚ÄúAn evening as stimulating musically as it was dazzling technically.‚Äù Michael Steinberg of the Boston Globe wrote, Pittel is ‚ÄúA superb musician and instrumentalist, with an elegant sense of phrase, vast technical resources, and beautiful firmly-centered tone.‚Äù The San Francisco Chronicle pointed out how Pittel has reached the goal for which all us musicians strive, ‚ÄúThe thing about Pittel is that he plays so well and so stylishly‚Ä¶ The control and variety of timbre ‚Äì along with a varied chest of instruments ‚Äì allows him to adapt to whatever he plays.‚Äù And now the kicker, ‚ÄúOne ends up hearing the music rather than the performer;‚Äù there just can‚Äôt be a loftier goal, and one which Pittel achieves night after night after night. Winthrop Sargeant in The New Yorker furthered all of those sentiments when he wrote, ‚Äú(Pittel is) Clearly a master of his instrument.‚Äù The great critic Harold Schonberg, also of The New York Times, summed it up the same way, ‚Äú(Pittel is) A master of his instrument.‚Äù As Stan Lee would say, ‚Äú‚ÄôNuff said.‚Äù For Pittel, born June 22, 1943, however, playing solo recitals is just one portion of a vast web of musical endeavors. As an orchestral soloist he has performed with the New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Louisville, Sacramento, Chautauqua, San Jose and San Antonio symphonies, to list just a few. Among the many conductors Pittel has worked with are Zubin Mehta, Michael Tilson Thomas, Varujan Kojian, Carter Nice, Abraham Chavez, Neville Marriner, Ingolf Dahl, Seiji Ozawa, Andrew Davis, Aaron Sten and Jose Serebrier. For Pittel, early collegiate work as a Music Education Major at the University of Southern California (USC) led him to graduate studies with Fred Hemke at Northwestern University where Pittel earned his master's degree. During the Vietnam War years Pittel served his country by accepting an appointment to The West Point Military Academy Band as an enlisted man. During this time he began further studies with Joe Allard of the Juilliard School. It was also during this time when Pittel made many trips to New York City to perform a wide variety of gigs, from small chamber pieces to works with orchestras, and it was just after leaving the West Point Band when Pittel won the Concert Artists Guild Competition and through this made his Carnegie Hall debut in 1971 playing to such acclamation he was re- presented by the same organization in 1973. When Pittel‚Äôs tour of duty was over he accepted a position as the saxophone teacher at USC, building the studio up to full size from just four when he was hired. Concurrently with the USC position, Pittel, who is constantly in a state of high energy as this interview will attest to, furthered his teaching credentials by accepting positions teaching at Cal State Fullerton, Cal State Long Beach, Cal State San Diego and East Los Angeles Junior College. Along with his many teaching successes, it was also during this period when Pittel‚Äôs performance career took off. In 1978 he made the jump and moved to New York City on a full-time basis, growing tired of continually hopping across the country from California to New York for all the gigs he was playing in the Big Apple. The move paid off and Pittel quickly found himself as perhaps the most in-demand saxophonist, no matter the genre, as a soloist worldwide. Today, in addition to a ridiculously busy performing schedule, Pittel is also the Professor of Saxophone at The University of Texas at Austin, performs as a soloist with professional orchestras and collegiate groups of all manner, gives countless solo recitals, tours with the Harvey Pittel Duo, the Harvey Pittel Trio, and the Harvey Pittel Saxophone Quartet, judges musical competitions throughout the world, gives innumerable master classes and clinics, and is frequently called upon to speak to different groups regarding music and its performance. Along the way Pittel has been featured on a number of movie soundtracks, including Manhattan for Woody Allen, appeared as a guest on The Today Show - seriously how many saxophonists can list that on their resume - and been featured on Live From Lincoln Center. He has received numerous other awards including two Martha Baird Rockefeller Fund grants, and a National Endowment for the Arts Solo Recitalist grant. To be fair and honest, all of the accolades listed above still leave so many equally stunning achievements out. A funny and warm individual, this kind of a litany of accomplishments would, for us mere mortals, be the work of three lifetimes, but for Pittel, who is still young, one knows for sure it‚Äôs only the beginning Former students include: Dr Jeffrey Benedict (faculty, Department of Music, California State University, Los Angeles),California State University, Los Angeles Retrieved 5 May 2012 Dr Dan Goble (Dean, School of Visual and Performing Arts, Western Connecticut State University; also plays with the Harvey Pittel Saxophone Quartet),Western Connecticut State University Retrieved 17 October 2010 Todd Oxford (faculty, School of Music, Texas State University, San Marcos)Texas State University, San Marcos.

He received his Naval Aviator wings in June 1970, and served as an attack pilot flying the A-4 Skyhawk and the AV-8A Harrier on land and sea assignments in the United States, Europe and the Western Pacific. O'Connor attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in 1975 and served as a test pilot with the Naval Air Test Center's Strike Test Directorate at Patuxent River, Maryland. During this 3¬Ω year assignment, he participated in evaluations of various conventional and VSTOL aircraft, including the A-4, OV-10, AV-8, and X-22 VSTOL research aircraft. From June 1977 to June 1979 he was the Naval Air Test Center project officer in charge of all Harrier flight testing, including the planning and execution of the First Navy Preliminary Evaluation of the YAV-8B advanced Harrier prototype. When informed of his selection to NASA's Astronaut Program in 1980, he was serving as the Deputy Program Manager (Acquisition) for the AV-8 program at the Naval Air Systems Command in Washington, D.C. NASA experience O'Connor was selected as an astronaut in May 1980. After a one- year initial training program at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, O'Connor served in a variety of functions in support of the first test flights of the Space Shuttle, including simulator test pilot for STS-1 and STS-2, safety/photo chase pilot for STS-3, and support crew for STS-4. He was CAPCOM (spacecraft communicator) for STS-5 through STS-9. He also served as Aviation Safety Officer for the NASA Astronaut Corps. When the Challenger and its crew were lost in January 1986, O'Connor was given a number of safety and management assignments over the next three years as the Space Agency recovered from the disaster. In the first days after the accident, he organized the initial wreckage reassembly activities at Cape Canaveral. Then he established and managed the operation of the NASA Headquarters Action Center, the link between NASA and the Presidential Blue Ribbon Accident Investigation Panel (The Rogers Commission). In March 1986 he was assigned duties as Assistant (Operations) to the Space Shuttle Program Manager, as well as first Chairman of NASA's new Space Flight Safety Panel: jobs he held until February 1988 and 1989 respectively. He subsequently served as Deputy Director of Flight Crew Operations from February 1988 until August 1991. As of this writing, O'Connor has flown over 5,000 hours in over 40 types of aircraft. A veteran of two space flights, he has over 386 hours in space, covering five and three quarter million miles in 253 orbits of the earth. O'Connor was pilot on STS-61-B in 1985 and was crew commander on STS-40 in 1991. O'Connor left NASA in August 1991 to become commanding officer of the Marine Aviation Detachment, Naval Air Test Center, Patuxent River. During this 10-month assignment, he led 110 test pilots and technicians, participated as an AV-8B project test pilot, instructed students at the Test Pilot School, directed the Naval Air Test Center Museum, and became the first Marine to serve as Deputy Director and Chief of Staff of the Flight Test and Engineering Group. O'Connor returned to NASA Headquarters in Washington, retiring from the Marine Corps to become the Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Flight. He was immediately assigned the task of developing a comprehensive flight safety improvement plan for the Space Shuttle, working closely with Congress and the Administration for funding of the major upgrade program. Then in late summer 1992, he was assigned as leader of the negotiating team that traveled to Moscow to establish the framework for what subsequently became the ambitious and complex joint manned space program known as Shuttle/MIR. In March 1993 O'Connor was assigned as Director, Space Station Redesign. He and his 50-person team of engineers, managers, and international partners developed, then recommended substantial vehicle and program restructure strategies which amounted to $300 million in savings per year, thus helping to save the program from cancellation by Congress. In September, he was named Acting Space Station Program Director. He held that position throughout the transition from the Freedom Program to the new International Space Station Program and the announcement of a permanent Program Director in January 1994. In April 1994, O'Connor was reassigned as Director, Space Shuttle Program. As such, he was responsible for all aspects of the $3.5 billion per year program, leading over 27,000 government and contractor personnel. By the time he left NASA in March 1996, he had directed NASA's largest and most visible program through twelve safe, successful missions, including the first three flights to the Russian Space Station, Mir. He planned and led an extensive program restructure designed to save the taxpayers approximately $1 billion over the five-year budget horizon. Of equal importance, he oversaw the introduction of several major safety improvements developed to prevent another \\"Challenger disaster\\". O'Connor left NASA in February 1996 to become an aerospace consultant. He also served on the Advisory Board of Airship Resources Corporation, a startup company planning to introduce high technology night sign display systems to the next generation large airships then under development in the United Kingdom. Until 2002, when he rejoined NASA as Chief of Safety and Mission Assurance, O'Connor served as Director of Engineering for Futron Corporation, a Bethesda, Maryland based company providing risk management and aerospace safety and dependability services to government and commercial organizations including the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Defense, NASA, Department of Energy, Westinghouse, AlliedSignal and others. O'Connor served as NASA Chief of Safety and Mission Assurance until August 31, 2011, retiring from the agency. Spaceflight experience STS-61-B Atlantis (November 26, to December 3, 1985). STS-61-B was the 22nd Shuttle flight and was the second- ever night shuttle launch from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. It was the heaviest payload weight carried to orbit by the Space Shuttle to date, and the first flight to deploy four satellites. The mission included the EASE/ACCESS experiment. After completing 108 orbits of the earth in 165 hours, Atlantis returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. STS-40 Columbia (June 5‚Äì14, 1991). STS-40 was the first Space Shuttle mission dedicated to life science studies. During the 9-day mission the crew performed an extensive series of biomedical experiments. After 145 orbits of the Earth traveling 3.29 million miles in 218 hours, O'Connor piloted Columbia to a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, his crew having safely and successfully completed over 100% of their mission objectives.

Onufriyenko was selected as a cosmonaut candidate in 1989. From September 1989 to January 1991, he underwent a course of general space training. Starting April 1991, he underwent training as a member of test cosmonauts group. Starting March 1994, he entered flight training to be the commander of the stand-by crew of the Mir-18 expedition aboard the Soyuz TM-21 spacecraft and the Mir space station as part of the Shuttle-Mir program. = Mir EO-21 = From February 21 to September 2, 1996, Onufriyenko served as Commander of the Mir EO-21 expedition. The Soyuz TM-23 spacecraft carrying Onufriyenko with cosmonaut Yury Usachov lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on February 21, 1996 at 12:34:05 UTC. After two days of autonomous flight, the Soyuz spacecraft docked with the Mir space station's forward-facing port on February 23 at 14:20 UTC. One month later, he and Yuri Usachov were joined by NASA astronaut Shannon Lucid. During Mir-21 Onufriyenko performed numerous research experiments including Protein crystal growth experiments experiments in materials science using high temperature melting oven \\"Optizon\\". The new module Priroda, the seventh and final module of the Mir Space Station arrived on April 26, 1996. Its primary purpose was to conduct Earth resource experiments through remote sensing and to develop and verify remote sensing methods. During Mir EO-21 supplies arrived with the Progress M-31 spacecraft. Onufriyenko and Yuri Usachov were joined by French astronaut Claudie Andr√©-Deshays after the departure of Shannon Lucid. On September 2, 1996, Onufriyenko, Usachev and Claudie Andr√©-Deshays returned to Earth on board the Soyuz TM-23 capsule. The spacecraft landed at 07:41:40 UTC 108 km south west of Akmola (Tselinograd). Altogether, on board Soyuz TM-23 and Mir, Onufriyenko logged 193 days in space. = Expedition 4 = Yury Onufriyenko works in the Zvezda module on the ISS. Onufrienko again served as Commander on ISS Expedition 4. Onufriyenko returned to space on board STS-108 mission. Launched on December 5, 2001, at 22:19:28 UTC from the Kennedy Space Center, Endeavour docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on December 7, 2001, at 20:03 UTC. The primary objective of STS-108 was to deliver supplies to and help maintain the ISS. During a 6-1/2 month stay aboard the ISS, the 3 member Expedition 4 crew (Onufriyenko and NASA astronauts Daniel W. Bursch and Carl E. Walz) performed flight tests of the station hardware, conducted internal and external maintenance tasks, and developed the capability of the station to support the addition of science experiments. The Expedition 4 crew returned to Earth aboard STS-111, with Endeavour landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on June 19, 2002. In completing this mission, Onufriyenko logged an additional 196 days in space, for a total of 389 days of spaceflight. = Spacewalks = Onufriyenko has performed eight career spacewalks totaling 42 hours and 33 minutes. As of June 2010, he has secured the 11th position in the list of astronauts who have the most spacewalk time. Onufriyenko performed six spacewalks during his stay on board the Mir Space Station and performed another two during his visit to the ISS. Onufriyenko performed his first career spacewalk on 15 March 1996. He and cosmonaut Usachov started the spacewalk at 01:04 UTC. They installed the second Strela boom and prepared for Mir Cooperative Solar Array (MCSA) installation. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 51 minutes. On 20 May 1996 Onufriyenko performed his second career spacewalk. The spacewalk started at 22:50 UTC and ended at 04:10 UTC clocking 5 hours and 20 minutes. During the spacewalk, the two cosmonauts removed the Mir cooperative solar array (MCSA) from its stowed position on the exterior of the docking module at the base of the Kristall module. They used the Strela boom to reach and move the array to the Kvant-1 module. The two spacewalkers also inflated an aluminum and nylon pup-up model of a Pepsi Cola can, which they then filmed against the backdrop of Earth. The Pepsi Cola company paid for the procedure and planned to use the film in a television commercial. However, the commercial never aired‚Äîreportedly because Pepsi later changed the design of the can. Onufriyenko performed his third career spacewalk on 24 May 1996. He and cosmonaut Usachov started the spacewalk at 22:50 UTC. They installed the MCSA on the Kvant-1 module. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 34 minutes. On 30 May 1996, Onufriyenko ventured outside the Mir Space Station to conduct his fourth career spacewalk. He and cosmonaut Usachov started the spacewalk at 18:20 UTC. They installed the modular optoelectrical multispectral scanner (MOMS) outside Priroda and handrails on the Kvant-2 module to facilitate moving around outside the station during future extravehicular activities. MOMS was used to study the Earth's atmosphere and environment. The spacewalk lasted 4 hours and 20 minutes. Onufriyenko is photographed in the Zvezda Module with Apples and oranges floating freely in front of him. On 6 June 1996, Onufriyenko performed his fifth career spacewalk. He and Usachov installed micrometeoroid detectors and replaced cassettes in the Swiss/Russian Komza experiment and installed the Particle Impact Experiment, the Mir Sample Return Experiment, and the SKK-11 cassette, which exposed construction materials to space conditions. The spacewalk lasted 3 hours and 34 minutes. Onufriyenko performed his sixth career spacewalk on 13 June 1996. The spacewalk started at 12:45 UTC and ended at 18:27 UTC clocking 5 hours and 42 minutes. During the spacewalk, Onufriyenko and Usachov installed the Rapana truss structure (an experiment mounting point) to the Kvant-1 module. Onufriyenko and Usachev also manually deployed the saddle-shaped traverse synthetic aperture radar antenna on Priroda. The large antenna had failed to open fully after receiving commands from inside Mir. Onufriyenko performed his seventh career spacewalk on January 14, 2002. The space walk was based out of the Pirs Airlock and used Russian Orlan space suits. Onufrienko and NASA astronaut Carl Walz relocated the cargo boom for the Russian Strela crane. They moved the boom from Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA 1) to the exterior of the Pirs Docking Compartment. The crew also installed an amateur radio antenna onto the end of the Zvezda Service Module. The spacewalk lasted 6 hours and 3 minutes. Onufriyenko performed his eighth career spacewalk on January 25, 2002 when he and NASA astronaut Daniel Bursch ventured out into space from the Pirs airlock. During the spacewalk, Onufrienko and Bursch installed six deflector shields for the Zvezda Service Module's jet thrusters. Also, they installed an amateur radio antenna. The two spacewalkers also removed an experiment called Kromka situated near one of the thruster groups and installed a virtually identical new Kromka experiment in the same place. The experiment captured material that results from thruster firings. Onufrienko and Bursch also attached a physics experiment called Platan to the Zvezda module. Platan was designed to capture low-energy heavy nuclei from the sun and from outside the solar system. In addition, they installed three materials experiments, called SKK for their Russian acronym, on the Zvezda module. The experiments examine effects of the harsh environment of space on a wide range of materials. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 59 minutes.

Collier, London \\"Ode to the West Wind\\" is an ode, written by Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1819 near Florence, Italy. It was originally published in 1820 by Charles in London as part of the collection Prometheus Unbound, A Lyrical Drama in Four Acts, With Other Poems. Perhaps more than anything else, Shelley wanted his message of reform and revolution spread, and the wind becomes the trope for spreading the word of change through the poet-prophet figure. Some also believe that the poem was written in response to the loss of his son, William (born to Mary Shelley) in 1819. The ensuing pain influenced Shelley. The poem allegorises the role of the poet as the voice of change and revolution. At the time of composing this poem, Shelley without doubt had the Peterloo Massacre of August 1819 in mind. His other poems written at the same time‚Äî\\"The Masque of Anarchy\\", Prometheus Unbound, and \\"England in 1819\\"‚Äîtake up these same themes of political change, revolution, and role of the poet.SparkNotes Editors. \\"SparkNote on Shelley‚Äôs Poetry\\". SparkNotes LLC. 2002. (accessed July 11, 2011).  Structure  Percy Bysshe Shelley's fair draft of lines 1‚Äì42, 1819, Bodleian LibraryThe poem \\"Ode to the West Wind\\" consists of five sections (cantos) written in terza rima. Each section consists of four tercets (ABA, BCB, CDC, DED) and a rhyming couplet (EE). The Ode is written in iambic pentameter. The poem begins with three sections describing the wind's effects upon earth, air, and ocean. In the last two sections, the poet speaks directly to the wind, asking for its power, to lift him up and make him its companion in its wanderings. The poem ends with an optimistic note which is that if winter days are here then spring is not very far.  Interpretation of the poem  The poem can be divided in two parts: the first three cantos are about the qualities of the Wind and each ends with the invocation \\"Oh hear!\\" The last two cantos give a relation between the Wind and the speaker. = First Canto = The first stanza begins with the alliteration \\"wild West Wind\\" (line 1). The form of the apostrophe makes the wind also a personification. However, one must not think of this ode as an optimistic praise of the wind; it is clearly associated with autumn. The first few lines contain personification elements, such as \\"leaves dead\\" (2), the aspect of death being highlighted by the inversion which puts \\"dead\\" (2) at the end of the line. These leaves haunt as \\"ghosts\\" (3) that flee from something that panics them. \\"chariotest\\" (6) is the second person singular. The \\"corpse within its grave\\" (8) in the next line is in contrast to the \\"azure sister of the Spring\\" (9)‚Äîa reference to the east wind‚Äîwhose \\"living hues and odours\\" (12) evoke a strong contrast to the colours of the fourth line of the poem that evoke death. In the last line of this canto the west wind is considered the \\"Destroyer\\" (14) because it drives the last signs of life from the trees, and the \\"Preserver\\" (14) for scattering the seeds which will come to life in the spring, = Second Canto = The second canto of the poem is much more fluid than the first one. The sky's \\"clouds\\"(16) are \\"like earth's decaying leaves\\" (16). They are a reference to the second line of the first canto (\\"leaves dead\\", 2).They also are numerous in number like the dead leaves. Through this reference the landscape is recalled again. The \\"clouds\\" (16) are \\"Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean\\" (17). This probably refers to the fact that the line between the sky and the stormy sea is indistinguishable and the whole space from the horizon to the zenith is covered with trailing storm clouds. The \\"clouds\\" can also be seen as \\"Angels of rain\\" (18). In a biblical way, they may be messengers that bring a message from heaven down to earth through rain and lightning. These two natural phenomena with their \\"fertilizing and illuminating power\\" bring a change. Line 21 begins with \\"Of some fierce Maenad\\" and again the west wind is part of the second canto of the poem; here he is two things at once: first he is \\"dirge/Of the dying year\\" (23‚Äì24) and second he is \\"a prophet of tumult whose prediction is decisive\\"; a prophet who does not only bring \\"black rain, and fire, and hail\\" (28), but who \\"will burst\\" (28) it. The \\"locks of the approaching storm\\" (23) are the messengers of this bursting: the \\"clouds\\". Shelley also mentions that when the West Wind blows, it seems to be singing a funeral song about the year coming to an end and that the sky covered with a dome of clouds looks like a \\"sepulchre\\", i.e., a burial chamber or grave for the dying year or the year which is coming to an end. Shelley in this canto \\"expands his vision from the earthly scene with the leaves before him to take in the vaster commotion of the skies\\". This means that the wind is now no longer at the horizon and therefore far away, but he is exactly above us. The clouds now reflect the image of the swirling leaves; this is a parallelism that gives evidence that we lifted \\"our attention from the finite world into the macrocosm\\". The \\"clouds\\" can also be compared with the leaves; but the clouds are more unstable and bigger than the leaves and they can be seen as messengers of rain and lightning as it was mentioned above. = Third Canto = This refers to the effect of west wind in the water. The question that comes up when reading the third canto at first is what the subject of the verb \\"saw\\" (33) could be. On the one hand there is the \\"blue Mediterranean\\" (30). With the \\"Mediterranean\\" as subject of the canto, the \\"syntactical movement\\" is continued and there is no break in the fluency of the poem; it is said that \\"he lay, / Lull'd by the coil of his crystalline streams, / Beside a pumice isle in Baiae's bay, / And saw in sleep old palaces and towers\\" (30‚Äì33). On the other hand, it is also possible that the lines of this canto refer to the \\"wind\\" again. Then the verb that belongs to the \\"wind\\" as subject is not \\"lay\\", but the previous line of this canto, that says Thou who didst waken ... And saw\\" (29, 33). But whoever‚Äîthe \\"Mediterranean\\" or the \\"wind\\"‚Äî\\"saw\\" (33) the question remains whether the city one of them saw, is real and therefore a reflection on the water of a city that really exists on the coast; or the city is just an illusion. Pirie is not sure of that either. He says that it might be \\"a creative you interpretation of the billowing seaweed; or of the glimmering sky reflected on the heaving surface\\". Both possibilities seem to be logical. To explain the appearance of an underwater world, it might be easier to explain it by something that is realistic; and that might be that the wind is able to produce illusions on the water. With its pressure, the wind \\"would waken the appearance of a city\\". From what is known of the \\"wind\\" from the last two cantos, it became clear that the wind is something that plays the role of a Creator. Whether the wind creates real things or illusions does not seem to be that important. Baiae's bay (at the northern end of the Gulf of Naples) actually contains visible Roman ruins underwater (that have been shifted due to earthquakes.) Obviously the moss and flowers are seaweed. It appears as if the third canto shows‚Äîin comparison with the previous cantos‚Äîa turning-point. Whereas Shelley had accepted death and changes in life in the first and second canto, he now turns to \\"wistful reminiscence [, recalls] an alternative possibility of transcendence\\". From line 26 to line 36 he gives an image of nature. But if we look closer at line 36, we realise that the sentence is not what it appears to be at first sight, because it obviously means, so sweet that one feels faint in describing them. This shows that the idyllic picture is not what it seems to be and that the harmony will certainly soon be destroyed. A few lines later, Shelley suddenly talks about \\"fear\\" (41). This again shows the influence of the west wind which announces the change of the season. = Fourth Canto = Whereas the cantos one to three began with \\"O wild West Wind\\" and \\"Thou\\" (15, 29) and were clearly directed to the wind, there is a change in the fourth canto. The focus is no more on the \\"wind\\", but on the speaker who says \\"If I ...\\" (43‚Äì44). Until this part, the poem has appeared very anonymous and was only concentrated on the wind and its forces so that the author of the poem was more or less forgotten. Pirie calls this \\"the suppression of personality\\" which finally vanishes at that part of the poem. It becomes more and more clear that what the author talks about now is himself. That this must be true, shows the frequency of the author's use of the first-person pronouns \\"I\\" (43‚Äì44, 48, 51, 54), \\"my\\" (48, 52), and \\"me\\" (53). These pronouns appear nine times in the fourth canto. Certainly the author wants to dramatise the atmosphere so that the reader recalls the situation of canto one to three. He achieves this by using the same pictures of the previous cantos in this one. Whereas these pictures, such as \\"leaf\\", \\"cloud\\", and \\"wave\\" have existed only together with the wind, they are now existing with the author. The author thinks about being one of them and says \\"If I were a . . .\\" (43 ff.). Shelley here identifies himself with the wind, although he knows that he cannot do that, because it is impossible for someone to put all the things he has learned from life aside and enter a \\"world of innocence\\". That Shelley is deeply aware of his closedness in life and his identity shows his command in line 53. There he says \\"Oh, lift me up as a wave, a leaf, a cloud\\" (53). He knows that this is something impossible to achieve, but he does not stop praying for it. The only chance Shelley sees to make his prayer and wish for a new identity with the Wind come true is by pain or death, as death leads to rebirth. So, he wants to \\"fall upon the thorns of life\\" and \\"bleed\\" (54). At the end of the canto the poet tells us that \\"a heavy weight of hours has chain'd and bow'd\\" (55). This may be a reference to the years that have passed and \\"chained and bowed\\" (55) the hope of the people who fought for freedom and were literally imprisoned. With this knowledge, the West Wind becomes a different meaning. The wind is the \\"uncontrollable\\" (47) who is \\"tameless\\" (56). One more thing that one should mention is that this canto sounds like a kind of prayer or confession of the poet. This confession does not address God and therefore sounds very impersonal. Shelley also changes his use of metaphors in this canto. In the first cantos the wind was a metaphor explained at full length. Now the metaphors are only weakly presented‚Äî\\"the thorns of life\\" (54). Shelley also leaves out the fourth element: the fire. In the previous cantos he wrote about the earth, the air and the water. The reader now expects the fire‚Äîbut it is not there. This leads to a break in the symmetry. = Fifth Canto = Again and again the wind is very important in this last canto. At the beginning of the poem the wind was only capable of blowing the leaves from the trees. In the previous canto the poet identified himself with the leaves. In this canto the wind is now capable of using both of these things mentioned before. Everything that had been said before was part of the elements‚Äîwind, earth, and water. Now the fourth element comes in: the fire. There is also a confrontation in this canto: Whereas in line 57 Shelley writes \\"me thy\\", there is \\"thou me\\" in line 62. These pronouns appear seven times in the fifth canto. This \\"signals a restored confidence, if not in the poet‚Äôs own abilities, at least in his capacity to communicate with [. . .] the Wind\\". It is also necessary to mention that the first-person pronouns again appear in a great frequency; but the possessive pronoun \\"my\\" predominates. Unlike the frequent use of the \\"I\\" in the previous canto that made the canto sound self-conscious, this canto might now sound self- possessed. The canto is no more a request or a prayer as it had been in the fourth canto‚Äîit is a demand. The poet becomes the wind's instrument, his \\"lyre\\" (57). This is a symbol of the poet's own passivity towards the wind; he becomes his musician and the wind's breath becomes his breath. The poet's attitude‚Äîtowards the wind has changed: in the first canto the wind has been an \\"enchanter\\" (3), now the wind has become an \\"incantation\\" (65). And there is another contrast between the two last cantos: in the fourth canto the poet had articulated himself in singular: \\"a leaf\\" (43, 53), \\"a cloud\\" (44, 53), \\"A wave\\" (45, 53) and \\"One too like thee\\" (56). In this canto, the \\"sense of personality as vulnerably individualised led to self-doubt\\" and the greatest fear was that what was \\"tameless, and swift, and proud\\" (56) will stay \\"chain'd and bow'd\\" (55). The last canto differs from that. The poet in this canto uses plural forms, for example, \\"my leaves\\" (58, 64), \\"thy harmonies\\" (59), \\"my thoughts\\" (63), \\"ashes and sparks\\" (67) and \\"my lips\\" (68). By the use of the plural, the poet is able to show that there is some kind of peace and pride in his words. It even seems as if he has redefined himself because the uncertainty of the previous canto has been blown away. The \\"leaves\\" merge with those of an entire forest and \\"Will\\" become components in a whole tumult of mighty harmonies. The use of this \\"Will\\" (60) is certainly a reference to the future. Through the future meaning, the poem itself does not only sound as something that might have happened in the past, but it may even be a kind of \\"prophecy\\" (69) for what might come‚Äîthe future. At last, Shelley again calls the Wind in a kind of prayer and even wants him to be \\"his\\" Spirit: \\"My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!\\" (62). Like the leaves of the trees in a forest, his leaves will fall and decay and will perhaps soon flourish again when the spring comes. That may be why he is looking forward to the spring and asks at the end of the last canto \\"If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?\\" (70). This is of course a rhetorical question because spring does come after winter, but the \\"if\\" suggests that it might not come if the rebirth is strong and extensive enough, and if it is not, another renewal‚Äîspring‚Äîwill come anyway. Thus the question has a deeper meaning and does not only mean the change of seasons, but is a reference to death and rebirth as well. It also indicates that after the struggles and problems in life, there would always be a solution. It shows us the optimistic view of the poet about life which he would like the world to know. It is an interpretation of his saying, If you are suffering now, there will be good times ahead. But the most powerful call to the Wind are the lines: \\"Drive my dead thoughts over the universe/like withered leaves to quicken a new birth!\\" Here Shelley is imploring‚Äîor really chanting to‚Äîthe Wind to blow away all of his useless thoughts so that he can be a vessel for the Wind and, as a result, awaken the Earth.  Conclusion  This poem is a highly controlled text about the role of the poet as the agent of political and moral change. This was a subject Shelley wrote a great deal about, especially around 1819, with this strongest version of it articulated the last famous lines of his \\"Defence of Poetry\\": \\"Poets are the hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration; the mirrors of the gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the present; the words which express what they understand not; the trumpets which sing to battle, and feel not what they inspire; the influence which is moved not, but moves. Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.\\"  References  Sources  * Anderson, Phillip B. \\"Shelley's 'Ode to the West Wind' and Hardy's 'The Darkling Thrush' \\".

As a separate piece, the \\"Ride\\" is often heard in a purely instrumental version, which may be as short as three minutes. Together with the \\"Bridal Chorus\\" from Lohengrin, the \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\" is one of Wagner's best-known pieces.  Context  The main theme of the \\"Ride\\", the leitmotif labelled , was first written down by the composer on 23 July 1851. The preliminary draft for the \\"Ride\\" was composed in 1854 as part of the composition of the entire opera, which was fully orchestrated by the end of March 1856. In the Walk√ºre opera, the \\"Ride\\", which takes around eight minutes, begins in the prelude to the third act, building up successive layers of accompaniment until the curtain rises to reveal a mountain peak where four of the eight Valkyrie sisters of Br√ºnnhilde have gathered in preparation for the transportation of fallen heroes to Valhalla. As they are joined by the other four, the familiar tune is carried by the orchestra, while, above it, the Valkyries greet each other and sing their battle-cry. Apart from the song of the Rhinemaidens in Das Rheingold, it is the only ensemble piece in the first three operas of Wagner's Ring cycle.  Performance history  The complete opera Die Walk√ºre was first performed on 26 June 1870 in the National Theatre Munich against the composer's intent. By January of the next year, Wagner was receiving requests for the \\"Ride\\" to be performed separately, but wrote that such a performance should be considered \\"an utter indiscretion\\" and forbade \\"any such thing\\". However, the piece was still printed and sold in Leipzig, and Wagner wrote a complaint to the publisher Schott. In the period up to the first performance of the complete Ring cycle, Wagner continued to receive requests for separate performances, his second wife Cosima noting \\"Unsavoury letters arrive for R. ‚Äì requests for the Ride of the Valkyries and I don't know what else.\\" Once the Ring had been performed in Bayreuth in 1876, Wagner lifted the embargo. He himself conducted it in London on 12 May 1877, repeating it as an encore.  Outside opera  Ride of the Valkyries, Cesare Viazzi Uses in film include the original score for The Birth of a Nation (1915), and What's Opera, Doc? (1957).

The central aim of WOMAD is to celebrate the world's many forms of music, arts and dance. History WOMAD was founded in 1980 by English rock musician Peter Gabriel, with Thomas Brooman, Bob Hooton, Mark Kidel, Stephen Pritchard, Martin Elbourne and Jonathan Arthur.Bright, Spencer: Peter Gabriel, an authorized biography (p. 180) , Pan 1999.Derek Beres, review of \\"Between Two Worlds\\", 2006. Accessed: http://www.globalrhythm.net/Film/BetweenTwoWorlds.cfmJonathan Arthur Original designers were Steve Byrne and Valerie Hawthorn. The first WOMAD festival was in Shepton Mallet, UK in 1982. The audience saw Peter Gabriel, Don Cherry, The Beat, Drummers of Burundi, Echo & The Bunnymen, Imrat Khan, Prince Nico Mbarga, Simple Minds, Suns of Arqa, The Chieftains and Ekome National Dance Company, founded by Barrington, Angie, Pauline and Lorna Anderson, the pioneering African arts company in the UK amongst others performing. Gabriel and his company, which had funded WOMAD, faced financial ruin from high costs of the festival in its very first year, worsened by the lack of suitable transport to the venue (Shepton Mallet Showground) and a lack of publicity. At the suggestion of Tony Smith, the manager of Gabriel and Genesis, he and the remaining members of Genesis agreed to play together for a single show under the name 'Six of the Best' at Milton Keynes. This performance included a dynamic inclusion of Ekome National Dance Company, fusing live African Drum on Peter Gabriel's track 'Rhythm Of The Heat'. The show rescued the company and made it possible for further WOMAD events to take place. Since 1982, WOMAD Festivals have travelled all over the world, bringing artists to numerous locations and entertaining over one million people. The main UK event was held at Rivermead in Reading, Berkshire, from 1990 until 2006. In 2017 WOMAD UK marked its 35th anniversary. Headliners Emir Kusturica & The No Smoking Orchestra, Toots and The Maytals, and Roy Ayers, Seun Kuti & Egypt 80 along with 30 other artists performed for a record-setting audience for the festival of 10,000 people. =Festival recordings= A double album was released in 1982 which preserves performances from the first festival.

For instance, the demilitarisation of Northern Ireland entailed the reduction of British security and military apparatuses. Demilitarisation in this sense is usually the result of a peace treaty ending a war or a major conflict. The principle is distinguished from demobilization, which refers to the drastic voluntary reduction in the size of a victorious army.  Definitions  Demilitarisation was a policy in a number of countries after both world wars. In the aftermath of World War I, the United Kingdom greatly reduced its military strength, which is also referred to as disarmament. The resulting position of British military weakness during the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany was among the causes that led to the policy of appeasement. The conversion of a military or paramilitary force into a civilian one is also called demilitarisation. For example, the Italian Polizia di Stato demilitarised in 1981, and the Austrian Gendarmerie merged with the national police, making up a new civilian body. Demilitarisation can also refer to the policies employed by Allied forces during the occupation of Japan and Germany after World War II.Haller, Oliver, Destroying Weapons of Coal, Air and Water: A Critical Evaluation of the American Policy of German Industrial Demilitarization 1945 - 1952 (Philipps- Universit√§t Marburg: Marburg, 2006). The Japanese and German militaries were re-badged to disassociate them from their recent war history, but were kept active and reinforced to help the allies face the new Soviet threat that had become evident as World War 2 ended, and the Cold War began. Demilitarisation can also refer to the reduction of one or more types of weapons or weapons systems (See Arms Control) or the removal of combat equipment from a warship (See Japanese battleship Hiei). A demilitarised zone is a specific area, such as a buffer zone between nations previously engaged in armed conflict, where military persons, equipment or activities are forbidden. This can also include areas designated during conflicts in which nations, military powers or contending groups forbid military installations, activities or personnel. The demilitarised zone is also free from all activities that assist the war efforts of any of the belligerents. Generally, this zone is protected from attack and many countries forbid their troops from targeting because it would constitute a grave breach or a serious war crime that would likely warrant the institution of criminal proceedings. In the case, however, of the Korean Demilitarised Zone, of the areas beyond the demilitarized strip that separates both sides, are heavily militarized. Examples of demilitarisation include: * The Treaty of Versailles barred post‚ÄìWorld War I Germany from having an air force, armoured vehicles, and certain types of naval vessels. In addition, it established a demilitarised zone in the Rhineland. * The massive reductions of military personnel in the Allied countries, following World War I.

It was also the first completely successful flight of the Ranger program. Launched on July 28, 1964, Ranger 7 was designed to achieve a lunar-impact trajectory and to transmit high-resolution photographs of the lunar surface during the final minutes of flight up to impact. The spacecraft carried six television vidicon cameras ‚Äì two wide-angle (channel F, cameras A and B) and four narrow-angle (channel P) ‚Äì to accomplish these objectives. The cameras were arranged in two separate chains, or channels, each self-contained with separate power supplies, timers, and transmitters so as to afford the greatest reliability and probability of obtaining high-quality video pictures. Ranger 7 transmitted over 4,300 photographs during the final 17 minutes of its flight. After 68.6 hours of flight, the spacecraft landed between Mare Nubium and Oceanus Procellarum. This landing site was later named Mare Cognitum. The velocity at impact was 1.62 miles per second, and the performance of the spacecraft exceeded hopes. No other experiments were carried on the spacecraft.National Space Science Data Center, Ranger 7, NSSDC ID: 1964-041A Aftermath of Ranger 6 and preparation for Ranger 7 Ranger 7 cameras system. Although NASA had attempted to put a positive spin on Ranger 6 on the grounds that everything except the camera system had worked well, William Coughlin, editor of the publication Missiles and Rockets, called it a \\"one hundred percent failure\\" and JPL's record thus far was \\"a disgrace\\". The mission had not been a complete failure, but Coughlin was not alone in his opinion that Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, a nonprofit laboratory and extension of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), was a \\"soft\\" academic environment without the drive or ambition needed to make the missions succeed. He considered Ranger a \\"loser\\" and for a while, anyone at NASA involved in the Ranger program tried to conceal it. It was also being said that sending probes up for the sole purpose of returning images was pointless and accomplished nothing that Apollo could not also achieve. Shortly after Ranger 6's mission concluded, a review board was convened to resolve the cause of the TV camera failure. This was determined quickly; the inadvertent activation of the camera telemetry system during ascent had been caused by an electrical short that crippled the power supply for the cameras. But why it had happened was as yet a mystery, especially as telemetry data sent back from the probe could only provide a limited amount of information. On February 14, 1964, JPL released a report noting that an internal command switch could have activated prematurely or that arcing had occurred in the umbilical connector on the payload fairing. However, there was no evidence of the latter happening or any obvious way that it could occur and several modifications were proposed to the camera system and/or the payload fairing. The NASA review board found that Ranger 6's systems were not as redundant as JPL had claimed, that prelaunch testing was inadequate, and there had been instances of the cameras turning themselves on at the RCA plant in New Jersey. If the cameras had to be completely redesigned from scratch, the next Ranger mission could be delayed almost a full year. The full report as submitted to Congress came under criticism from several people at NASA, noting that, although the cameras lacked redundancy, any one of dozens of failure modes in the booster or spacecraft could also result in failure to return any TV images. In regards to the lack of adequate prelaunch testing, they brought up the incident back in 1961 with Ranger 1 deploying its solar panels during a ground test and that ground tests with full 60 W power had been discontinued on the Block II probes for fear of accidentally igniting the midcourse correction engine on the pad and destroying the entire launch vehicle in the process. RCA also promised to look into workmanship standards at their main plant in Hightstown, New Jersey, when examination of a sealed Ranger module discovered a plastic bag with screws and washers inside. Although there was suspicion that this had been done by a disgruntled employee, it was far more probable that someone had done it by accident. Since no obvious reason for the malfunction could be found in the cameras themselves, investigation next shifted to the electrical umbilical on the payload fairing. This umbilical connector would normally be attached on the ground to permit testing of the Ranger's subsystems and only a thin hinged door covered it during launch. One of the pins on the connector was \\"hot\\" and could easily be bridged, transferring a voltage to the adjacent pins and activating the TV camera system during launch. As for the cause of it, one possibility was electrostatic discharge, the other was a shock wave of some sort. Alexander Bratenahl, a physicist at JPL's Space Sciences Division, suggested that the electrical short was caused by venting propellant during Atlas booster section jettison. There was no tracking camera footage of this event on Ranger 6's launch, which had occurred on an overcast day, but film of other Atlas launches showed that a large white plume enveloped the launch vehicle after staging. Convair technicians confirmed that of LOX was vented from the Atlas after staging, but although the shock wave theory seemed tempting, James Kendall, another JPL physicist, dismissed it out of hand. The idea of an electrostatic discharge was also unlikely given the thinning air and high altitude of the Atlas when staging occurred. Bratenahl persisted and studied more film of Atlas launches with the frames enlarged, which revealed light flashes in the post-staging plume. Another phone call to Convair revealed that of RP-1 were also dumped during staging and that the Atlas's sustainer engine exhaust ignited the propellant cloud, producing these flashes. Since the umbilical door on the payload shroud was only held in place with a thin latching mechanism, hot gases from igniting propellant could have contacted the electrical connector and caused a short. The inadvertent activation of the telemetry system during launch had occurred almost simultaneous with booster jettison at T+140 seconds. With that, the book could be closed on the cause of Ranger 6's failure. Among the changes made for Ranger 7 included new procedures to apply full power testing to the spacecraft off of the launch pad, where there was no risk of the midcourse correction engine activating on top of a fully fueled Atlas-Agena. Jet Propulsion Laboratory had originally wanted to have Ranger 7 impact in the same general area as Ranger 6 so the impact crater could be imaged, but lighting conditions during July would not be favorable so they instead decided to go for a little- known area 11 degrees south of the Moon's equator near the Sea of Storms. The probe was shipped to Cape Canaveral in mid-June along with Atlas 250D and Agena 6009. Spacecraft design Launch of Atlas Agena B with Ranger 7. Rangers 6, 7, 8, and 9 were called Block 3 versions of the Ranger spacecraft. The spacecraft consisted of a hexagonal aluminum frame base 1.5 m across on which was mounted the propulsion and power units, topped by a truncated conical tower which held the TV cameras. Two solar panel wings, each 739 mm wide by 1537 mm long, extended from opposite edges of the base with a full span of 4.6 m, and a pointable high-gain dish antenna was hinge mounted at one of the corners of the base away from the solar panels. A cylindrical quasi- omnidirectional antenna was seated on top of the conical tower. The overall height of the spacecraft was 3.6 m. Propulsion for the mid-course trajectory correction was provided by a 224 N thrust monopropellant hydrazine engine with four jet-vane vector control. Orientation and attitude control about three axes was enabled by twelve nitrogen gas jets coupled to a system of three gyros, four primary Sun sensors, two secondary Sun sensors, and an Earth sensor. Power was supplied by 9,792 silicon solar cells contained in the two solar panels, giving a total array area of 2.3 square meters and producing 200 W. Two 1200 watt-hour AgZnO batteries rated at 26.5 V with a capacity for 9 hours of operation provided power to each of the separate communication/TV camera chains. Two 1000 watt-hour AgZnO batteries stored power for spacecraft operations. Communications were through the quasiomnidirectional low-gain antenna and the parabolic high-gain antenna. Transmitters aboard the spacecraft included a 60 W TV channel F at 959.52 MHz, a 60 W TV channel P at 960.05 MHz, and a 3 W transponder channel 8 at 960.58 MHz. The telecommunications equipment converted the composite video signal from the camera transmitters into an RF signal for subsequent transmission through the spacecraft high-gain antenna. Sufficient video bandwidth was provided to allow for rapid framing sequences of both narrow- and wide-angle television pictures. Mission profile First image of the Moon taken by a U.S. spacecraft. The large crater at center right is Alphonsus Last picture by Ranger 7, taken about 488 m above the Moon, reveals features as small as 38 cm across. The noise pattern at right results from spacecraft impact while transmitting. On July 6, Ranger 7 completed its ground testing and was stacked atop the booster. On July 9, a NASA committee met and deemed the booster and spacecraft fully ready for launch, which was targeted for the 27th. The first countdown on July 27 failed due to a defective battery in the Atlas and a problem with the ground guidance equipment. The next day, all went smoothly and Ranger 7 lifted off from LC-12 at 12:50 PM EST. The weather was clear and cloudless on this launch and Atlas staging was observed by tracking cameras. The expected propellant cloud enveloped the booster, but no anomalous events occurred this time. Thirty minutes after liftoff, the Agena restarted to boost Ranger 7 on a trajectory towards the Moon. The flight trajectory for Ranger 7 was quite accurate, but a short midcourse correction would still be needed to ensure impact in the Sea of Storms instead of the far side of the Moon, which was carried out early on the morning of July 29. The warmup period for the TV cameras would be performed earlier and made shorter than on Ranger 6. Out of fear of jeopardizing the mission, ground controllers decided that the probe's orientation was acceptable enough and they would not risk maneuvering with the attitude control thrusters to get into a better angle. At 6:09 AM PDT, the first video imagery reached Earth. As Ranger 7 sped towards the surface of the Moon, TV camera performance remained normal. Images of the cratered lunar surface continued to filter back to JPL headquarters in Pasadena, California and finally, at 6:25, impact occurred and all signals from the probe ceased. In the JPL control room, there was \\"rapturous celebration\\". Ranger 7 had delivered the first close-distance imagery of the lunar surface and \\"more than anything, even the manned Mercury missions, had at last undone the sting Americans felt at Sputnik 1's launch\\". The photographs returned from the probe found that the Moon was most likely \\"very craggy and rocky with debris everywhere\\". After speaking to the media, NASA officials were peppered with the obvious question ‚Äì did the Moon have a surface solid enough that humans could safely land on it? Geologist Gerard Kuiper replied that, judging by the images, it seemed likely that at least some of the Moon was smooth enough to land a spacecraft on. However, the actual hardness of the surface couldn't be determined with certainty until a soft landing was made. Nonetheless, Ranger 7's images did seem to suggest that it was solid enough. Ranger 7 reached the Moon on July 31. The F-channel began its one-minute warm-up 18 minutes before impact. The first image was taken at 13:08:45 UT at an altitude of 2110 km. Transmission of 4,308 photographs of excellent quality occurred over the final 17 minutes of flight. The final image taken before impact has a resolution of 0.5 meters. The spacecraft encountered the lunar surface in direct motion along a hyperbolic trajectory, with an incoming asymptotic direction at an angle of -5.57 degrees from the lunar equator. The orbit plane was inclined 26.84 degrees to the lunar equator. After 68.6 hours of flight, Ranger 7 impacted in an area between Mare Nubium and Oceanus Procellarum (subsequently named Mare Cognitum) at . (The impact site is listed as 10.63 S, 20.66 W in the initial report \\"Ranger 7 Photographs of the Moon\\".) Impact occurred at 13:25:48.82 UT at a velocity of 2.62 km/s. The spacecraft performance was excellent and the success of the mission finally brought a turnaround in NASA's fortunes after the endless string of lunar probe failures since 1958. Ranger 7 is credited for beginning the \\"peanut\\" tradition at NASA command stations. On the success of Ranger 7, someone in the control room was noticed eating peanuts. Since 1964 control rooms ceremonially open a container of peanuts for luck and tradition.

It is affiliated with both the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the International Affiliation of Writers Guilds (IAWG). History The union was founded in 1959 as the Television and Screen Writers' Guild (commonly known as the Screen Writers' Guild), the successor to the Screenwriters' Association dating back to 1938. During the 1960s it expanded to cover radio and book writers and adopted its present title in 1966. It sponsored the campaigns of the Writers' Action Group to establish the Public Lending Right and the Authors' Licensing and Collecting Society which ‚Äì starting from a single room in the Writers' Guild premises ‚Äì has collected and distributed over ¬£100 million in payments to writers for photocopying and overseas retransmission of broadcasts. WGGB also hosts the annual Writers' Guild Awards. In 1997 WGGB merged with the Theatre Writers Union, and membership now stands at around 2,600. Presidents, chairs and leading activists of WGGB have included: Lord (Ted) Willis, Jimmy Perry, Bryan Forbes, Denis Norden, Maureen Duffy, Alan Plater, Rosemary Anne Sisson, Wally K. Daly, Ian Curteis, J.C. Wilsher, David Nobbs, Anthony Read, Olivia Hetreed and David Edgar, the noted playwright, TV and film writer (Nicholas Nickleby for the Royal Shakespeare Company; Pentecost, which won an Evening Standard award in 1994; The Jail Diary of Albie Sachs; Albert Speer, based on Gitta Sereny's biography of Hitler's architect; Playing With Fire; etc.) The current president is Sandi Toksvig OBE. Activities It represents writers working in television, radio, film, theatre, books and multimedia. It negotiates a series of Minimum Terms Agreements governing writers' contracts and covering minimum fees, advances, repeat fees, royalties and residuals, rights, credits, number of drafts, script alterations and the resolution of disputes. The most important MTAs cover: BBC TV Drama; BBC Radio Drama; ITV Companies; PACT (independent TV and film producers); TAC (Welsh language independent TV producers); Theatrical Management Association; Independent Theatre Council; and an agreement covering the Royal National Theatre, Royal Shakespeare Company and Royal Court Theatre. These agreements are regularly renegotiated and in most cases the minimum fees are reviewed annually. WGGB advises its members on all aspects of their working lives. This includes contract vetting, legal advice, help with copyright problems and representation in disputes with producers, publishers or other writers. Regular events are organised for members. Examples include a Meet the Agents event in London, Television Writing: Women's Work? in Leeds, an exclusive Archers event in the West Midlands, plus screenings of new and upcoming film releases. The Annual General Meeting features an address by an industry professional/s, an opportunity to debate issues of importance to writers and amend WGGB's rules. Lobbying WGGB is a campaigning union and effective lobbying efforts have concentrated on MEPs considering the European copyright directive, and MPs, peers and the media over the Communications Bill and the BBC Charter renewal. WGGB made strong protests when crowd violence halted performances of Behzti by Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti at the Birmingham repertory theatre in December 2004, and subsequently revived its Anti-Censorship Committee. WGGB makes a point of highlighting the importance of writing for children in all media. It co- operates closely with other unions including Equity, the Musicians' Union and the Society of Authors; and is affiliated to the British Copyright Council, Creators' Rights Alliance, Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom and other pressure groups. WGGB representatives attend regular briefings with the Arts Council, Ofcom, the Public Lending Right agency and other national bodies. Recent campaigns include the Equality Writes campaign, tackling inequality in the screen industries. International affiliations International connections include: International Affiliation of Writers Guilds (screenwriters guilds in the UK, US, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, France and Mexico); European Writers Congress (over 50 organisations); F√©d√©ration des Sc√©naristes d'Europe (screenwriters' groups in 14 countries); UNI-MEI (worldwide trade union organisation representing millions of workers in the TV, film, media and entertainment industries). WGGB has a reciprocal membership and services arrangement with the Irish Playwrights and Screenwriters Guild. UK WGGB members who achieve TV or film writing contracts in the US can join the Writers Guild of America without paying the usual $2,500 initial fee. Welfare The Writers' Guild Pension Scheme provides personal pension plans customised for freelance writers who may need to make irregular and sometimes small pension contributions. The scheme is coupled with clauses in several Guild MTAs entitling members to pension contributions in addition to their writing fees. Over the years the Writers' Guild Welfare Fund has accumulated more than ¬£40,000, which is available to provide loans or grants to members in financial difficulty. Membership Full Membership is open to anyone who has received payment for a piece of written work under a contract with terms no less than those negotiated by WGGB. Writers who do not qualify can join as Candidate Members, or Student Members. Awards The WGGB Awards were first given out in 1961.

Vetrov was an engineer who had been assigned to evaluate information on NATO hardware and software gathered by the \\"Line X\\" technical intelligence operation for Directorate T, the Soviet Union directorate for scientific and technical intelligence collection from the West. He became increasingly disillusioned with the Soviet system and decided to work with the French at the end of the 1970s. Between early 1981 and early 1982, Vetrov gave almost 4,000 secret documents to the DST, including the complete list of 250 Line X officers stationed under legal cover in embassies around the world. As a consequence, Western nations undertook a mass expulsion of Soviet technology spies. The CIA also mounted a counter-intelligence operation that transferred modified hardware and software designs to the Soviets. Thomas Reed alleged this was the cause of a trans-Siberian pipeline disaster in 1982, however this claim has been challenged. Vetrov's story inspired the 1997 book Bonjour Farewell: La V√©rit√© sur la Taupe Fran√ßaise du KGB by Serguei Kostine. It was adapted in the French film L'affaire Farewell (2009) starring Emir Kusturica and Guillaume Canet. Background Vetrov was a 53-year-old engineer assigned to evaluate the intelligence on capitalist hardware and software collected by spies (\\"Line X\\") for Directorate T. He became disillusioned, and at the end of 1980 volunteered his services to France for ideological reasons. French intelligence gave him the codename \\"Farewell\\" ‚Äî an English word so that the KGB would assume he worked for the CIA if they learned of the code-name. Between early 1981 and early 1982, Farewell supplied the DST with about four thousand secret documents, including a list of Soviet organizations in scientific collection and summary reports from Directorate T on the goals, achievements, and unfulfilled objectives of the program. He revealed the names of more than 200 Line X officers stationed in 10 KGB residences in the West, along with more than 100 leads to Line X recruitments. In a private meeting on 19 July 1981, at the Ottawa Summit, French president Fran√ßois Mitterrand made President Ronald Reagan aware of Farewell and offered the intelligence to the United States. William Safire said Mitterrand described the man as belonging to a section that was evaluating the achievements of Soviet efforts to acquire NATO technology. Reagan expressed great interest in Mitterrand's revelations and thanked him for having the material sent to the United States government. It was passed through Vice President Bush and then to William Casey, his Director of Central Intelligence. Casey called in Gus W. Weiss, then working with Thomas C. Reed on the staff of the National Security Council. After studying the list of hundreds of Soviet agents and purchasers (including one cosmonaut) assigned to this penetration in the US and Japan, Weiss counselled against deportation. The dossier, under the name of Farewell, reached the CIA in August 1981. It demonstrated that the Soviets had spent years carrying out their espionage of research and development activities. CIA response While Vetrov was recruited by the French, the Western counter-reaction came from the US. Safire was writing a series of hardline columns denouncing the financial backing being given to Moscow by Germany and Britain for the Trans-Siberian Pipeline, a major natural gas pipeline from Siberia to Europe. That project would give control of European energy supplies to the Communists, as well as generate US$8 billion a year to support Soviet computer and satellite research. The CIA mounted a counter-intelligence operation that transferred modified hardware and software designs over to the Soviets. They instigated an operation of disinformation and faulty technology transfer. Information from Vetrov also led to the arrest in New York of the spy Dieter Gerhardt, a South African naval officer who had been passing secrets to the Soviets for 20 years. His handler, Vitaly Shlykov, was arrested and subsequently imprisoned in Switzerland while attempting to meet with Gerhardt's wife, Ruth, who was acting as his courier. =Counterintelligence response= According to Reed, another result was that the United States and its NATO allies later \\"rolled up the entire Line X collection network, both in the US and overseas.\\" Weiss said \\"the heart of Soviet technology collection crumbled and would not recover\\". Discovery Eventually, Vetrov's defection led to his death. \\"Vetrov fell into a tragic episode with a woman and a fellow KGB officer in a Moscow park. In circumstances that are not clear, he stabbed and killed the officer and then stabbed but did not kill the woman. He was arrested, and, in the ensuing investigation, his espionage activities were discovered; he was eventually executed in 1985. CIA had enough intelligence to institute protective countermeasures.\\" By 1985 Mitterrand came to suspect that Vetrov had been a CIA plant set up to test him after his election in 1981 to see if the material would be handed over to the Americans or kept by the French. Acting on this mistaken belief, Mitterrand fired the chief of the French service, Yves Bonnet. The details of the operation were declassified in 1996.  Reception  First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba Fidel Castro wrote in a 2007 article that the campaign of countermeasures based on Farewell's dossier was an economic war; that although no lives were lost in the gas pipeline explosion, the Soviet economy was significantly damaged; and that between 1984 and 1985, the United States and its NATO allies had put an end to the technology spying operation, which had destroyed the capacity of the USSR to capture technology when Moscow was caught between a defective economy on one hand and a US President determined to prevail and end the Cold War on the other.

Although he did not create any new furniture style, he interpreted fashionable European trends in a manner so distinguished and particular that he became a major spokesman for Neoclassicism in the United States, influencing a whole generation of American cabinetmakers. An American icon Born Duncan Fife near Loch Fannich, Scotland, he immigrated with his family to Albany, New York, in 1784 and served as a cabinetmaker‚Äôs apprentice. In 1791 he moved to New York City and one year later is documented the earliest mention of him in the city, when he was elected to the General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen, sponsored by Isaac Nichols and Seabury Champlin, either of whom may have trained him. Shop and warehouse on 168-172 Fulton Street, New York city. By the time of his marriage in 1793, he appears in the New York directories as a \\"joiner,\\" but by 1794 he called himself \\"cabinetmaker\\" and had changed the spelling of his name to Phyfe. He opened his own business in 1794 and was listed as a cabinetmaker in the New York Directory and Register. From his first shop on 2 Broad Street, he later moved to Partition Street (later renamed Fulton Street in 1817 in honor of Robert Fulton), where he stayed for the rest of his life. A poor immigrant when he arrived in America from his native Scotland, Phyfe acquired wealth and fame through hard work, exceptional talent and the support of patrons. He would come to count among his clients some of the nation's wealthiest and most storied families. Throughout the first half of the nineteenth century he made Neoclassical furniture for the social and mercantile elite of New York, Philadelphia, and the American South where he was particularly popular. Known during his lifetime as the \\"United States Rage\\", to this day remains America's best-known cabinetmaker.Peter M. Kenny, Michael K. Brown, Frances F. Bretter and Matthew A. Thurlow. Duncan Phyfe: Master Cabinetmaker in New York. Metropolitan Museum of Art (2011) Establishing his reputation as a purveyor of luxury by designing high-quality furniture. His personal style, characterized by superior proportions, balance, symmetry, and restraint, became the New York local style. Many apprentices and journeymen exposed to this distinctive style by serving a stint in the Phyfe shop or by copying the master cabinetmaker's designs helped to create and sustain this local school of cabinetmaking. Demand for Phyfe's work reached its peak between 1805 and 1820, although he remained a dominant figure in the trade until 1847, when he retired at the age of seventy-seven. Within the short span of a single generation, however, the work of the master was all but forgotten until the revival in the 1920s, when different furniture companies replicated his designs for several decades. He became known as one of America's leading cabinetmakers by selling furniture at relatively low prices. Phyfe‚Äôs work encompassed a broad range of the period‚Äôs Neoclassical styles, starting from his earliest furnitures‚Äî which bear the influence of his 18th-century British predecessors Thomas Sheraton and Thomas Hope‚Äî continuing with Regency, Federal, Empire and ending with his late simplified designs in the Grecian plain style. James Duncan Phyfe Between 1837 and 1847, Duncan Phyfe took his two sons, Michael and James, as business partners and the firm went under the names D. Phyfe & Sons (1837‚Äì1840) and after Michael's premature death, D. Phyfe & Son (1840‚Äì1847). It was during the latter and final stages of the business‚Äôs history that perhaps the greatest challenge Phyfe ever faced emerged; how to cope with the new wave of historical revival styles. In 1840, one Southern planter who came to New York from Columbia, South Carolina, observed to his wife in a letter that the Phyfes were \\"as much behind the times in style as (they were) in price.\\" This is because the Phyfes always adhered to the classicist language until the end,Peter M. Kenny, Changing Perspectives on an Iconic American Craftsman, Duncan Phyfe at the Metropolitan Museum. Antiques & Fine Art magazine winter 2012 anniversary issue: p. 120 they never fully engaged with the emerging historical revival styles (e.g. Baroque, Gothic, Rococo, etc.) that began in the 1830s. Duncan Phyfe and his son James finally closed down the family business in 1847 after fifty-five years in the trade. They held an auction of the remaining contents of their furniture warehouse. The auctioneer was Halliday & Jenkins.Peter Kenny, \\"It Don‚Äôt Mean a Thing if it Ain‚Äôt Got that Swing\\", Classical American Homes Preservation Trust Because Phyfe's furniture was seldom signed, yet widely imitated, it is sometimes difficult to determine with accuracy which works he actually made.

Another exhibition took place at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston from 24 June ‚Äì 9 September 2012. Duncan Phyfe's furniture can be admired in the White House Green Room, Edgewater, Roper House and especially at Millford Plantation, owned by the Classical American Homes Preservation Trust. His furniture appears in many museums and private collections as well. In popular culture Karl Shapiro refers to the fly's leg as \\"the fine leg of a Duncan- Phyfe,\\" in his poem \\"The Fly\\". Likewise, in one of the passages of the novel Tender is the Night by F. Scott Fitzgerald, he wrote: \\"She wept all over a set that cost a fortune, in a Duncan Phyfe dining-room...\\".F. Scott Fitzgerald, Tender is the Night (1934): p. 77 Similarly, in her novel Jazz, Toni Morrison refers to Phyfe: ‚Äúafter they‚Äôd eaten they rolled cigarettes and settled down on the curb as though it were a Duncan Phyfe.‚Äù [Toni Morrison, ‚ÄúJazz‚Äù (1992): p. 196] Fran Lebowitz references his artistry as a fine companion for anyone in her piece ‚ÄúPointers for Pets‚Äù from her collection Social Studies (1981): ‚ÄúGeorgian silver and Duncan Phyfe sofas make wonderful companions, as do all alcoholic beverages and out-of-season fruits.‚Äù (p. 55)Fran Lebowitz, ‚ÄúPointers for Pets‚Äù in Social Studies (1981): p. 55 One of the world's largest roadside attractions is a giant chair located in Thomasville, North Carolina. The monument was erected in 1950, and the plaque located on its pedestal reads as follows: \\"This chair is an exemplar and inspiration for future generations to emulate and perpetuate the achievements of our time-honored furniture designers and craftsmen. ... The original chair was the creation of the famous American designer Duncan Phyfe\\". Some years later, another replica of a Phyfe model chair was built in 1959 in Washington, DC.

He was Lord Chancellor of England from 1068 to 1070. After serving as Lord Chancellor, he was consecrated Bishop of Elmham in 1070, but about 27 May 1072 he moved the see to Thetford, thus becoming Bishop of Thetford. He had a conflict with the Bury St. Edmunds Abbey, and when the case was brought forward, the Archbishop of Canterbury Lanfranc ruled against Herfast. He signed the Accord of Winchester in 1072. Bishop Herfast died in 1084. He was a married bishop, and his sons held land in Norfolk at the time of Domesday Book in 1086.

The idea behind the equations is Reynolds decomposition, whereby an instantaneous quantity is decomposed into its time-averaged and fluctuating quantities, an idea first proposed by Osborne Reynolds. The RANS equations are primarily used to describe turbulent flows. These equations can be used with approximations based on knowledge of the properties of flow turbulence to give approximate time-averaged solutions to the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations. For a stationary flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid, these equations can be written in Einstein notation in Cartesian coordinates as: : \\\\rho\\\\bar{u}_j \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bar{u}_i }{\\\\partial x_j} = \\\\rho \\\\bar{f}_i \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_j} \\\\left[ - \\\\bar{p}\\\\delta_{ij} \\\\+ \\\\mu \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bar{u}_i}{\\\\partial x_j} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bar{u}_j}{\\\\partial x_i} \\\\right) \\\\- \\\\rho \\\\overline{u_i^\\\\prime u_j^\\\\prime} \\\\right ]. The left hand side of this equation represents the change in mean momentum of a fluid element owing to the unsteadiness in the mean flow and the convection by the mean flow. This change is balanced by the mean body force, the isotropic stress owing to the mean pressure field, the viscous stresses, and apparent stress \\\\left( - \\\\rho \\\\overline{u_i^\\\\prime u_j^\\\\prime} \\\\right) owing to the fluctuating velocity field, generally referred to as the Reynolds stress. This nonlinear Reynolds stress term requires additional modeling to close the RANS equation for solving, and has led to the creation of many different turbulence models. The time-average operator \\\\overline{.} is a Reynolds operator.  Derivation of RANS equations  The basic tool required for the derivation of the RANS equations from the instantaneous Navier‚ÄìStokes equations is the Reynolds decomposition. Reynolds decomposition refers to separation of the flow variable (like velocity u) into the mean (time-averaged) component (\\\\overline{u}) and the fluctuating component (u^{\\\\prime}). Because the mean operator is a Reynolds operator, it has a set of properties. One of these properties is that the mean of the fluctuating quantity is equal to zero (\\\\bar{u^\\\\prime} = 0). Thus, : u(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t) = \\\\bar{u}(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) + u^\\\\prime(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t) \\\\,, where \\\\boldsymbol{x} = (x,y,z) is the position vector. Some authors prefer using U instead of \\\\bar{u} for the mean term (since an overbar is sometimes used to represent a vector). In this case, the fluctuating term u^\\\\prime is represented instead by u. This is possible because the two terms do not appear simultaneously in the same equation. To avoid confusion, the notation u, \\\\bar{u}, \\\\mbox{ and } u^{\\\\prime} will be used to represent the instantaneous, mean, and fluctuating terms, respectively. The properties of Reynolds operators are useful in the derivation of the RANS equations. Using these properties, the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations of motion, expressed in tensor notation, are (for an incompressible Newtonian fluid): : \\\\frac{\\\\partial u_i}{\\\\partial x_i} = 0 : \\\\frac{\\\\partial u_i}{\\\\partial t} + u_j \\\\frac{\\\\partial u_i}{\\\\partial x_j} = f_i \\\\- \\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x_i} \\\\+ u \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u_i}{\\\\partial x_j \\\\partial x_j} where f_i is a vector representing external forces. Next, each instantaneous quantity can be split into time-averaged and fluctuating components, and the resulting equation time-averaged, = 0 : \\\\overline{\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\left( \\\\bar{u_i} + u_i^\\\\prime\\\\right)}{\\\\partial t}} \\\\+ \\\\overline{\\\\left( \\\\bar{u_j} + u_j^\\\\prime\\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\left( \\\\bar{u_i} + u_i^\\\\prime\\\\right)}{\\\\partial x_j}} = \\\\overline{\\\\left( \\\\bar{f_i} + f_i^\\\\prime\\\\right)} \\\\- \\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} \\\\overline{\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\left(\\\\bar{p} + p^\\\\prime\\\\right)}{\\\\partial x_i}} \\\\+ u \\\\overline{\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\left( \\\\bar{u_i} + u_i^\\\\prime\\\\right)}{\\\\partial x_j \\\\partial x_j}}.

Finally, since integration in time removes the time dependence of the resultant terms, the time derivative must be eliminated, leaving: : \\\\rho \\\\bar{u_j}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bar{u_i} }{\\\\partial x_j} = \\\\rho \\\\bar{f_i} \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_j} \\\\left[ - \\\\bar{p}\\\\delta_{ij} \\\\+ 2\\\\mu \\\\bar{S_{ij}} \\\\- \\\\rho \\\\overline{u_i^\\\\prime u_j^\\\\prime} \\\\right].

Following the Norman conquest of England, he served as Lord Chancellor (‚Äì1078) and as the second bishop of Salisbury, or Old Sarum. Life Osmund, a native of Normandy, accompanied William the Conqueror to England, and was made Chancellor of the realm about 1070.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 83 He was employed in many civil transactions and was engaged as one of the Chief Commissioners for drawing up the Domesday Book. Some late sources state he was created Earl of Dorset at the same time, but he did not refer to himself with that title. Osmund became bishop of Salisbury by authority of Gregory VII,Parker, Anselm. \\"St. Osmund.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 28 Mar. 2013 and was consecrated by Archbishop Lanfranc around 3 June 1078.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 270 His diocese comprised the counties of Dorset, Wiltshire, and Berkshire, having absorbed the former bishoprics of Sherborne and Ramsbury under its incumbent Herman at the 1075 Council of London. In his Acts of the English Bishops, William of MalmesburyWilliam of Malmesbury, Gesta pontificum anglorum, 183. describes medieval Salisbury as a fortress rather than a city, placed on a high hill, surrounded by a massive wall. Peter of Blois later referred to the castle and church as \\"the ark of God shut up in the temple of Baal.\\" Henry I's biographer C. Warren HollisterHollister, Henry I (Yale English Monarchs) 2001:36f. suggests the possibility that Osmund was in part responsible for Henry's education; Henry was consistently in the bishop's company during his formative years, around 1080 to 1086. In 1086 Osmund was present at the Great Gemot held at Old Sarum when the Domesday Book was accepted and the great landowners swore fealty to the sovereign.Edward A. Freeman, The History of the Norman Conquest of England. Osmund died in the night of 3 December 1099, and was succeeded, after the see had been vacant for eight years, by Roger of Salisbury, a statesman and counsellor of Henry I. His remains were buried at Old Sarum, translated to New Salisbury on 23 July 1457, and deposited in the Lady Chapel, where his sumptuous shrine was destroyed under Henry VIII. A flat slab with the simple inscription has lain in various parts of the cathedral. In 1644 it was in the middle of the Lady Chapel. It is now under the easternmost arch on the south side. Works Saint Osmond Osmund's work was threefold ‚Äî first, the building of the cathedral at Old Sarum, which was consecrated on 5 April 1092. Five days afterwards a thunderstorm entirely destroyed the roof and greatly damaged the whole fabric. Second was the constitution of a cathedral body. This was framed on the usual Norman model, with dean, precentor, chancellor, and treasurer, whose duties were exactly defined, some thirty-two canons, a subdean, and succentor. All save the last two were bound to residence. These canons were \\"secular,\\" each living in his own house. Their duties were to be special companions and advisers of the bishop, to carry out with fitting solemnity the full round of liturgical services and to do missionary work in the surrounding districts. There was formed a school for clergy of which the chancellor was the head. The cathedral was thoroughly constituted \\"the Mother Church\\" of the diocese, \\"a city set on a hill\\". Osmund's canons were renowned for their musical talent and their zeal for learning, and had great influence on the foundation of other cathedral bodies. Third was the formation of the \\"Sarum Use.\\" In Osmund's day there were many other \\"Uses\\" (those of York, Hereford, Bangor, and Lincoln remained) and other customs peculiar to local churches, and the number was increased by the influx of Normans under William. Osmund invented or introduced little himself, though the Sarum rite had some peculiarities distinct from that of other churches. He made selections of the practices he saw round him and arranged the offices and services. Intended primarily for his own diocese, the Ordinal of Osmund, regulating the Divine Office, Mass, and Calendar, was used, within a hundred years, almost throughout England, Wales, and Ireland, and was introduced into Scotland about 1250. The unifying influence of the Norman Conquest made its spread more easy. It held general approval until in Mary's reign so many clergy obtained particular licences from Cardinal Pole to say the Roman Breviary that this became universally received. The \\"Register of St. Osmund\\" is a collection of documents without any chronological arrangement, gathered together after his time, divided roughly into two parts: the \\"Consuetudinary\\" (Rolls Series, 1‚Äì185, and in Rock, vol. III, 1‚Äì110), styled \\"De Officiis Ecclesiasticis\\", and a series of documents and charters, all more or less bearing on the construction of the cathedral at Old Sarum, the foundation of the cathedral body, the treasures belonging to it, and the history of dependent churches. The existing \\"Consuetudinary\\" was taken from an older copy, re-arranged with additions and modifications and ready probably when Richard Poore consecrated the cathedral at New Salisbury in 1225. A copy, almost verbatim the same as this, was taken from the older book for the use of St. Patrick's, Dublin, which was erected into a cathedral and modelled on the church at Sarum by Henry de Loundres who was bishop from 1213‚Äì28.Todd, in The British Magazine vols. xxx and xxxi. William of MalmesburyWilliam of Maslmesbury, Gesta pontificum anglorum 184. in summing up Osmund's character says he was \\"so eminent for chastity that common fame would itself blush to speak otherwise than truthfully concerning his virtue. Stern he might appear to penitents, but not more severe to them than to himself. Free from ambition, he neither imprudently wasted his own substance, nor sought the wealth of others\\". Osmund gathered together a good library for his canons. A late- medieval source notes, somewhat disdainfully, that even as a bishop he would scribe, illuminate and bind books himself; by that period this was eccentric behaviour, but it was not so in 11th-century England.Dodwell, C.R.; Anglo- Saxon Art, A New Perspective, p. 47, 1982, Manchester UP, (US edn. Cornell, 1985) At one time Osmund thought Archbishop Anselm too unyielding and needlessly scrupulous in the dispute concerning investitures and in 1095 at the Council of Rockingham favoured the king. But after the Lateran Council in 1099, he boldly sided with the archbishop and the beautiful anecdote is related, showing his simple sincerity, how when Anselm was on his way to Windsor, Osmund knelt before him and received his forgiveness. He had a great reverence for St. Aldhelm who 300 years before as Bishop of Sherborne had been Osmund's predecessor. He officiated at the saint's translation to a more fitting shrine at Malmesbury and helped Lanfranc to obtain his canonization. Abbot Warin gave him a bone of the left arm of St. Aldhelm which he kept at Sarum where miracles were wrought. In 1228 the Bishop of Sarum and the canons applied to Gregory IX for Osmund's canonization but not until some 200 years afterwards on 1 January 1457, was the bull issued by Callistus III.British History Online Bishops of Salisbury accessed on 30 October 2007 In 1472 a special indulgence was granted by Sixtus IV for a visit to his cathedral on his festival and a convocation held in St. Paul's in 1481 fixed 4 December as the day to commemorate him. A house at Bishop Wordsworth's School is named for him. He is commemorated by a statue in niche 178 on the west front of Salisbury Cathedral.

Tilton is a proponent of the prosperity gospel who is widely known for his infomercial-styled religious television program Success-N-Life, which at its peak in 1991 aired in all 235 American TV markets (daily in the majority of them), brought in nearly $80 million per year, and was described as \\"the fastest growing television ministry in America.\\"\\"The Apple of God's Eye\\", produced by Robbie Gordon, Primetime Live, first broadcast November 21, 1991. Within two years after ABC's Primetime Live raised questions about Tilton's fundraising practices, beginning a series of investigations into the ministry, Success-N-Life was taken off the air. Tilton later returned to television via his new version of his program, which airs on BET and The Word Network. Biography and the early years Robert Tilton was born in McKinney, Texas, on June 7, 1946. He attended Cooke County Junior College and Texas Technological University. He married his first wife, Martha \\"Marte\\" Phillips, in 1968. According to his autobiographical materials, Tilton had a conversion experience to evangelical Christianity the following year and began his ministry in 1974, taking his family on the road to, in his words, \\"preach this gospel of Jesus.\\" Tilton preached to small congregations and revivals throughout Texas and Oklahoma.\\"Prosperity and Healing: Is it Promised to the Believer?, Ken L. Sarles, retrieved June 11, 2006. His family settled in Dallas and built the Word of Faith Family Church, a small nondenominational charismatic church in Farmers Branch, in 1976. The church started a local television program then known as Daystar. Tilton's young church was growing steadily, but Daystar failed to expand beyond the Dallas area until Tilton traveled to Hawaii his self-described version of Jesus's forty days in the wilderness\\"Robert Tilton's Heart of Darkness\\", Scott Baradell, first published in the Dallas Observer on February 6, 1992, p. 18; quoted in Christianity In Crisis by Hank Hanegraaff, Harvest House Publishers, 1993, p. 347. and came upon an increasingly popular new form of television programming: the late- night infomercial. Tilton was particularly influenced by Dave Del Dotto, a real estate promoter who hosted hour-long infomercials showing his glamorous life in Hawaii, as well as on-camera testimonials lauding his \\"get rich quick\\" books. Upon his return from Hawaii in 1981, Tilton, with the help of a US$1.3 million loan from Dallas banker Herman Beebe, revamped Daystar into an hour- long \\"religious infomercial\\" with the title Success-N-Life. Success-N-Life On Success-N-Life, Tilton regularly taught that all of life's trials, especially poverty, were a result of sin. His message consisted mainly of impressing upon viewers the importance of making \\"vows\\"‚Äîfinancial commitments to Tilton's ministry. His preferred vow, stressed frequently on his broadcasts, was $1,000. Occasionally, Tilton would claim to have received a word of knowledge for someone to give a vow of $5,000 or even $10,000. When a person made a vow to Tilton, he preached that God would recognize the vow and reward the donor with vast material riches.\\"Second Coming: A Jet-Settin', Scotch-Sippin' Robert Tilton Washes Up in South Florida and He Still Wants Your Money\\", Sean Rowe, Dallas Observer, quoted by Cephas Ministries, retrieved June 11, 2006. The show also ran \\"testimonials\\" of viewers who gave to Tilton's ministry and reportedly received miracles in return, a practice that would be used as the basis for a later lawsuit from donors charging Tilton's ministry with fraud.CBS Evening News with Connie Chung, CBS, first broadcast April 22, 1994; as compiled on The Prophet of Prosperity: Robert Tilton and the Gospel of Greed, DVD produced by The Trinity Foundation, publication date not specified. A Dallas Morning News story published in 1992 observed that Tilton spent more than 84% of his show's airtime for fundraising and promotions, a total higher than the 22% for an average commercial television show;\\"TV Preachers Seen as 'Beggars': Public Dislikes Evangelists' Onscreen Methods\\", Dallas Morning News, first published on November 21, 1992; quoted in Christianity in Crisis by Hank Hanegraaff, Harvest House Publishers, 1993, p. 348. other sources put the total fundraising time during episodes of Success-N-Life closer to 68%. Some of Tilton's fundraising letters were written by Gene Ewing, the head of a multimillion-dollar marketing empire writing donation letters for other televangelists like W. V. Grant and Don Stewart. As a result of Tilton's television success, Word of Faith Family Church grew to become a megachurch, with 8,000 members at its height. Tilton also wrote several self help books about financial success, including The Power to Create Wealth, God's Laws of Success, How to Pay Your Bills Supernaturally, and How to be Rich and Have Everything You Ever Wanted. Most of his books were published in the 1980s and distributed via promotion on Success-N-Life and through the many mailings Tilton's ministry sent his followers. The books were republished in the late 1990s to be used as centerpieces of his 1997 infomercial series and are now promoted on his current () daily live internet broadcast.Success-N-Life home page, retrieved March 3, 2009. Ministry and fundraising scandal In 1991, Diane Sawyer and ABC News conducted an investigation of Tilton (as well as two other Dallas- area televangelists, Grant and Larry Lea). The investigation, assisted by Trinity Foundation president Ole Anthony and broadcast on ABC's Primetime Live on November 21, 1991, alleged that Tilton's ministry threw away prayer requests without reading them, keeping only the accompanying money or valuables sent to the ministry by viewers, garnering his ministry an estimated US$80 million a year. =Allegations of exploitation of vulnerable people= Anthony, a Christian minister whose organization works with the homeless and the poor on the east side of Dallas, first took an interest in Tilton's ministry in the late 1980s after encountering needy people who told him they had lost all of their money making donations to high-profile televangelists, especially Tilton. Curious about the pervasiveness of the problem, the Trinity Foundation got on the mailing lists of several televangelists, including Tilton, and started keeping records of the many types of solicitations they received almost daily from various ministries. Former Coca-Cola executive Harry Guetzlaff came to Trinity after he had been turned away from Tilton's church when he found himself on hard times following a divorce. He had been a longtime donor and gave up his last $5,000 as a \\"vow of faith\\" just weeks earlier. Guetzlaff's experience, combined with the sheer magnitude of mailings from Tilton's ministry, spurred Anthony, a former Air Force intelligence officer and licensed private investigator, to start a full investigation of Tilton's ministry. Guetzlaff joined Anthony in the task of gathering details on Tilton's operation and later did much of the legwork in uncovering the paper trail for the ABC News investigation.\\"The Antichrist of East Dallas\\", Burkhard Bilger, The New Yorker, first published on December 6, 2004; retrieved June 11, 2006. =Undercover investigation= In a November 21, 1991, promotional appearance on Live with Regis and Kathie Lee, Sawyer said that she had incidentally watched several televangelist programs, including Success-N-Life, and was both \\"fascinated\\" and \\"disturbed\\" by them. Stressing the public's sensitivity to reporters questioning religion, Sawyer said that she spoke with other journalists, and then eventually to ABC producers, who then decided to conduct their own investigation into Grant, Lea, and Tilton.Live with Regis and Kathie Lee, aired November 21, 1991, as compiled on The Prophet of Prosperity: Robert Tilton and the Gospel of Greed, DVD produced by The Trinity Foundation, publication date not specified. ABC producers learned about possible resources available from Anthony and Trinity, and contacted them for information. After comparing their accumulated notes, data and details, the two groups decided to pool their efforts and began planning the undercover portion of the story. Anthony agreed to portray himself as a Dallas-based minister with a small church looking into the ways TV ministries could grow so quickly, and the ABC producers would pose as Anthony's \\"media consultants.\\" =Meeting with Response Media= The team, armed with hidden cameras and microphones, arrived for a meeting at Response Media, the Tulsa- based marketing firm handling Tilton's mass mailings, to discuss a proposal sent by Anthony to Response Media about fundraising for a religious-based TV talk show. The director of Response Media, Jim Moore, described for Anthony and the hidden cameras (concealed in the undercover Primetime Live producers' glasses and handbags) many techniques used by Tilton to raise funds for his ministry. Moore also said that Tilton was doing \\"far better than anyone knows\\" and described the main strategy Tilton employed for such a high return rate on his mailings‚Äîthat is, send the recipient a \\"gimmick\\" that compelled the recipient to mail something back in return, and most recipients would include some money along with it. Moore declined to disclose how much Response Media was paid for its services or how much money the mailings were generating for the Tilton ministry. However, as part of his sales pitch to Anthony, Moore disclosed that the response letters generated by the fundraising mailings Response Media sends out for its clients were never delivered to the client; instead, they were sent unopened to the client's financial institution or other institutions of choice. \\"You never have to touch it\\", Moore added in response to a clarification question from Anthony about dealing with the gimmick objects sent to the potential donors in the mails. One of the ABC producers asked whether this was a standard practice‚Äî\\"So the mail goes straight to the bank?\\"‚Äîand Moore asserted that it was: \\"The mail goes to the bank, and they put the money in your account. We just get the paper with the person's name and how much they gave.\\" = 1991 Primetime Live documentary (\\"The Apple of God's Eye\\") = Trinity members, acting on this information, started digging through dumpsters outside Tilton's many banks in the Tulsa area as well as dumpsters outside the office of Tilton's lawyer, J. C. Joyce (also based in Tulsa). Over the next thirty days, Trinity's \\"garbologists\\", as Anthony dubbed them, found tens of thousands of discarded prayer requests, bank statements, computer printouts containing the coding for how Tilton's \\"personalized\\" letters were generated, and more, all of which were shown in detail on the Tilton segment within the Primetime Live broadcast, titled \\"The Apple of God's Eye\\". In a follow-up broadcast on November 28, 1991, Sawyer said that Trinity and Primetime Live assistants found prayer requests in bank dumpsters on fourteen separate occasions in a thirty day period.Follow-up segment to \\"The Apple of God's Eye\\", Primetime Live, first broadcast November 28, 1991. =Denial= Tilton vehemently denied the allegations and took to the airwaves on November 22, on a special episode of Success-N-Life entitled \\"Primetime Lies\\", to air his side of the story. He asserted that the prayer requests found in garbage bags shown on Primetime Live were stolen from the ministry and planted in the dumpster for a sensational camera shot, and that he prayed over every prayer request received, to the point that he \\"laid on top of those prayer requests so much that 'the chemicals actually got into [his] bloodstream, and... [he] had two small strokes in [his] brain.\\" Tilton remained defiant on claims regarding his use of donations to his ministry to fund various purchases, asking, \\"Ain't I allowed to have nothing?\\" with regards to his ownership of multiple multimillion-dollar estates. Tilton also claimed that he needed plastic surgery to repair capillary damage to his lower eyelids from ink that seeped into his skin from the prayer requests.http://www.salon.com/people/feature/2000/11/21/tilton/ Oh God, You Devil ‚Äì Salon.com =Further revelations= After Trinity members spent weeks poring over the details of the documents they and ABC had uncovered, sorting and scrutinizing each prayer request, bank statement, and computer printout dealing with the codes Tilton's banks and legal staff used when categorizing the returned items, Anthony called a press conference in December 1991 to present what he described as Tilton's \\"Wheel of Fortune\\", using a large display covered in actual prayer requests, copies of receipts for document disposition, and other information which demonstrated what happened to money and prayer requests which the average viewer of Tilton's television program sent him.The Prophet of Prosperity: Robert Tilton and the Gospel of Greed, DVD produced by The Trinity Foundation, publication date not specified. When both Tilton and his lawyer J. C. Joyce reacted to the news by claiming the items Anthony was displaying had somehow been stolen by \\"an insider\\", Anthony responded in a subsequent interview that \\"Joyce was our mole‚Äîa lot of this stuff came from the dumpster outside his office.\\" Primetime Lives original investigation and subsequent updates included interviews with several former Tilton employees and acquaintances. In the original investigation, one of Tilton's former prayer hotline operators claimed the ministry cared little for desperate followers who called for prayer, saying Tilton had a computer installed in July 1989 to make sure the operators talked to no caller for longer than seven minutes. The former employee also revealed very specific instructions were given to them in terms of how to talk with callers and they were told to always ask for a $100 \\"vow\\" at a minimum. Also in the original report, a former friend of Tilton's from college (who remained anonymous and was shown in silhouette) claimed both he and Tilton would attend tent revival meetings as a \\"sport\\" and would claim to be anointed and healed at the meetings. He added the two had often discussed the notion that after graduation they would set up their own roving revival ministry \\"and drive around the country and get rich.\\" In a July 1992 update to the investigation, Primetime Live interviewed Tilton's former maid, who claimed prayer requests which were sent to Tilton's house by the ministry were routinely ignored until he told her to move them out of the house and into the garage; according to the maid, \\"they stacked up and stacked up\\" in the garage until Tilton had them thrown away. In the same interview, Tilton's former secretary came forward and claimed Tilton lifted excerpts from \\"get rich quick\\" books and used them in his sermons, and she never saw him perform normal pastoral duties such as visiting with the sick and praying with members. =Government involvement= Despite Tilton's repeated denials of misconduct, the State of Texas and the federal government became involved in subsequent investigations, finding more causes for concern about Tilton's financial status with each new revelation. After nearly 10,000 pounds of prayer requests and letters to the Tilton ministry were found in a disposal bin at a Tulsa area recycling firm in February 1992, along with itemized receipts of their delivery from Tilton's main mail-handling service in Tulsa rather than from the church offices in Farmers Branch, Tilton admitted in a deposition given to the Texas Attorney General's office that he often prayed over computerized lists of prayer requests instead of the actual prayer requests themselves, and that prayer requests were in fact routinely thrown away after categorization. As each revelation became increasingly more damaging, viewership and donations declined dramatically. The last episode of Success-N-Life aired nationally on October 30, 1993. By that time, viewership had fallen 85 percent and monthly donations went from $8 million to $2 million. =Failed libel action= In 1992, Tilton sued ABC for libel because of its investigation and report, but the case was dismissed in 1993. Federal Judge Thomas Rutherford Brett, in his July 16, 1993, dismissal of the case, stated that information in Trinity's logs on prayer requests reportedly found in dumpsters on September 11, 1991, \\"could not have been found then because the postmark date was after September 11, 1991\\", but also noted that Anthony had recanted the erroneous entries in a subsequent affidavit. Tilton appealed the decision in 1993; although the findings of the original court were upheld in 1995, federal Judge Michael Burrage's opinion criticized ABC and the Primetime Live producers for their editing of the story and noted that ABC had been warned by their own religion editor, Peggy Wehmeyer (who knew Anthony from her work as a religion reporter at ABC affiliate WFAA-TV in Dallas), that, \\"Mr. Anthony could not be trusted and was obsessed with his crusade against [Tilton].\\" Tilton once more appealed the decision, this time to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1996, but the court refused to hear the case. = Tilton sued for fraud = Several donors to Tilton's television ministry sued Tilton in 1992‚Äì1993, charging various forms of fraud. One plaintiff, Vivian Elliott, won $1.5 million in 1994 when it was discovered that a family crisis center for which she had made a donation (and recorded an endorsement testimonial) was never built or even intended to be built. The judgment was later reversed on appeal. As part of the defense strategy to the fraud cases, Tilton sued Anthony, Guetzlaff and four plaintiff's lawyers who had filed the fraud cases against him in federal court in Tulsa. The tactic is known to critics as a \\"SLAPP\\" (strategic lawsuit against public participation) suit. Tilton claimed that the individuals conspired to violate his First Amendment rights under a federal statute designed to protect black citizens from the Ku Klux Klan. (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1985.) Defense attorneys Martin Merritt of Dallas and ACLU lawyer Michael Linz, also of Dallas, with others, won dismissal for the six defendants in federal district court. On appeal, in Tilton v. Richardson, 6 F.3d 683 (10th Cir.1993), the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal on the grounds that 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1985 did not protect a nonminority individual against a purely private conspiracy, if one existed. The fraud cases continued until the Texas Supreme Court eventually ruled that the plaintiffs could not prove damages because they could not show that, if Tilton had actually prayed over the prayer requests, the prayers would have been answered. The decline of Success-N-Life also led to the end of Tilton's 25-year marriage to his wife Marte, who had been administrative head of the Word of Faith Family Church and World Outreach Center, in 1993. Dallas lawyer Gary Richardson, who represented many of the parties suing Tilton for fraud, attempted to intervene in the Tiltons' divorce, citing the potential for the divorce settlement to be used to hide financial assets that were currently part of the many fraud cases; Richardson's petition to have the divorce action put on hold until after the fraud cases were settled was denied. Marte intervened in Tilton's second divorce from Leigh Valentine, who had asked the court to include the church and all its assets as community property in the proceedings. Under Texas law, property accumulated during a marriage is considered community property and thus subject to division between the parties in a divorce. The jury eventually ruled against the request. Lexington Academy Lexington Academy was a small private Christian school in Farmers Branch that was founded in the early 1980s by Robert and Marte Tilton. The name \\"Lexington\\" was chosen in honor of the Battle of Lexington; the school mascot was the Patriots. The school was a member of the Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools (TAPPS), and won dozens of State Championships in Athletics, Academics, and Fine Arts during the less than twenty years of its existence, including five overall TAPPS State Championships.http://www.tapps.net/index.html Lexington Academy Yearbooks 1988-1998 The school was dissolved in 1998 as a result of debts incurred from lawsuits against Tilton and his ministry. Transitional ministry Tilton returned to television in 1994 with a new program called Pastor Tilton, a show with an emphasis on \\"demon blasting\\" exorcism practices, usually involving Tilton shouting as loudly as possible at demons supposedly possessing people suffering from pain and illness. However, this program was far less successful than its predecessor, and was cancelled by the end of the year. Reviving Success 'N' Life After moving to Fort Lauderdale, Florida in 1996, Tilton returned to the airwaves in 1997 with a new version of Success-N-Life, buying airtime on independent television stations primarily serving inner city areas. The new version of Success-N-Life returned to Tilton's previous message of asking for \\"vows of faith\\" from viewers instead of exorcisms. In 1998, the program began airing on Black Entertainment Television (BET) as part of its two-hour late night umbrella rotation block of religious programming entitled BET Inspiration. In 2008, Success-N-Life usually occupied the first hour of the BET programming block and also ran on The Word Network.The Word Network program listing page, retrieved January 8, 2007. Most of the shown on BET Inspiration were taped in the late 1990s‚Äîwith testimonials from 1980s-era episodes interspersed throughout the episodes‚Äîbut Tilton also recorded infomercials for his books at least once a year from 2003 to 2007, often appearing with his third wife, Maria Rodriguez, and their four French poodles.\\"Bob's Back, and More Entertaining than Ever\\", Steve Blow, Dallas Morning News, published September 25, 2004, retrieved June 18, 2006. The Word of Faith Family Church and World Outreach Center was finally formally dissolved by Tilton in 1996. Though Tilton was still listed as the church's senior pastor, he had not preached at the church since March 16, 1996, when he named Chattanooga, Tennessee minister Bob Wright as senior associate pastor, and its membership had declined to less than 300. The church building was purchased by the city of Farmers Branch in 1999 for use as a future civic center; however, the economy suffered a downturn and the plans were scrapped, and the building was finally demolished in 2003 to make room for a new Dallas Stars-sponsored youth hockey center. In March 2005, Tilton started a new church in Hallandale, Florida, not far from his home in Miami Beach. The church had already existed for some time under the pastorship of former televangelist David Epley. Tilton's new church, now called \\"Christ the Good Shepherd Worldwide Church\\", had approximately 200 members in 2007. On May 13, 2007, the church moved into a new location in Miami and was officially renamed \\"Word of Faith Church\\", much like the original church in Dallas. Tilton also established a church in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2005, also originally named Christ the Good Shepherd Worldwide Church. It has also been officially renamed \\"Word of Faith Church\\". The Las Vegas church's resident pastor is Natalie Vafai. Current ministry When Tilton returned to television in 1997, he established his ministry's headquarters in Tulsa, where his lawyer J. C. Joyce's offices were located, and set up a post office box as its mailing address. A woman employed by Mail Services, Inc., a Tulsa-area clearinghouse that handled mail sent to Tilton's ministry, said that when she worked for Mail Services, Inc. in 2001, prayer requests were still routinely thrown away after donations and pledges were removed.\\"Robert Tilton: From Downfall to Windfall\\" , Ziva Branstetter, Tulsa World, first published May 4, 2003; quoted by The Trinity Foundation, retrieved June 17, 2006. However, Tilton dropped the Tulsa address in late 2007 and used a Miami post office box to receive responses to his fundraising mailings. In January 2014, he was holding services at the Courtyard Marriott in Culver City, California, while having donations again sent to a post office box in Tulsa. In 1998, The Washington Post reported that Tilton's following disappeared after the investigations but he had \\"joined dozens of other preachers to become fixtures on BET\\". Consequently, Tilton, along with Stewart and Peter Popoff, received \\"criticism from those who say that preachers with a long trail of disillusioned followers have no place on a network that holds itself out as a model of entrepreneurship for the black community.\\" Steve Lumbley, who worked for Tilton's ministry in 1991 when the original Primetime Live investigation took place, told a reporter for the Dallas Observer in 2006 that reports of prayer request disposal that were the centerpiece of the ABC expos√© were highly exaggerated. In an article for the Observer blog \\"Unfair Park\\", Lumbley asserted that \\"[t]he mailings all had some kind of gimmick. They weren't godly at all. But the primary allegation that came out of that‚Äîthat prayer requests were thrown away‚Äîwas categorically untrue, and I can guarantee you that was not a normal practice.\\" However, Lumbley, who now runs a Christian watchdog website called ApostasyWatch.com, does credit ABC and the Trinity Foundation for exposing Tilton's unethical fundraising tactics, noting that, \\"God was using Ole and ABC to chastise Tilton and bring him down.\\"\\"The Robert Tilton Files\\", Glenna Whitley, Dallas Observer \\"Unfair Park\\" online blog, dated August 6, 2006; retrieved October 4, 2006. Trinity still monitors Tilton's television ministry as part of its ongoing televangelist watchdog efforts. In a 2003 interview published in the Tulsa World, Anthony estimated that with none of the Word of Faith Family Church overhead and with television production costs at a fraction of the original Success-N-Life program, Tilton's current organization was likely grossing more than $24 million per year tax-free. Satire In 1985, two men began distributing a video they compiled lampooning Tilton and his ostensible conversations with God. The video exploits Tilton's facial expressions and preaching style. The original video contained no title screen and was roughly edited. The video featured a medley of footage from Success-N-Life overdubbed with well-timed sound effects of flatulence. Unofficial VHS copies of the video circulated in the U.S. through the late 1980s under such titles as Tooting Tilton, Heaven Only Knows (the first title by the original distributors), Pastor Gas, The Joyful Noise, and The Farting Preacher. After the hosts of The Mark & Brian Show, a radio program in Los Angeles, mentioned the video on the air, the video's authors saw the market potential and began selling official copies of their creation. Similar videos have since been made with more recent footage of Tilton and are distributed throughout the Internet, all under the Farting Preacher name. The video distribution (including digital bootlegs distributed online) expanded public awareness of Tilton and his controversial television ministry. The song \\"I Know\\" on the Barenaked Ladies' 1996 album Born on a Pirate Ship includes the lines: \\"If a hundred monkeys each could get their own show / perhaps one day a chimp might say: > followed by a sample of Tilton saying \\"and you have faith! You just need to > use it, saith the Lord.\\" The musician Pogo created the song, \\"Hoo Ba Ba Kanda\\" using the sounds and words of Tilton from his program. The comedy material of Ron White also includes mention of Tilton. In the opening to White's act in the first Blue Collar Comedy Tour movie, Ron claims that \\"while sitting in a beanbag chair naked eating Cheetos\\", he finds Tilton on TV and believes Tilton is talking specifically to him: \\"Are you lonely?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" \\"Have you wasted half your life in bars pursuing sins of the flesh?\\" \\"This guy's good...\\" \\"Are you sitting in a beanbag chair naked eating Cheetos?\\" Ron gapes in horror before squeaking, \\"...Yes sir!\\" \\"Do you feel the urge to get up and send me a thousand dollars?\\" (pause for effect) \\"Close! I thought he was talking about me there for a second. Apparently, I ain't the only cat on the block (who) digs Cheetos!\\" In the early 2000s, the Trinity Foundation put together a number of news broadcasts, including the initial Primetime Live piece, from the years surrounding the investigations into Tilton's ministry on a DVD entitled The Prophet of Prosperity: Robert Tilton and the Gospel of Greed. The DVD also includes segments from The Daily Show's \\"God Stuff\\" (hosted by Trinity member John Bloom, a.k.a. Joe Bob Briggs), excerpts from the Pastor Gas videos, and a number of mocking music videos, as well as moments from Success-N-Life showing Tilton's more outrageous claims of \\"visions from God.\\" A comedian on BET's ComicView once made fun of Success-N-Life, mainly because BET usually aired it immediately following their explicit music video show Uncut. The name \\"Tilton\\" is referred to in the song \\"Cash Cow (A Rock Opera In Three Small Acts)\\", from the album called Squint by music artist and film director Steve Taylor, where it says: Tilton's antics are also lampooned in the area of software technology by Douglas Crockford. Crockford created \\"The Tilton Macro Preprocessor\\", which he describes as \\"one of the ugliest programming languages ever conceived\\". Bruce Prichard, who portrayed Brother Love in the WWE, has stated that the character was largely based on Tilton's way of speaking. The comedian and satirist John Oliver criticized Tilton's televangelism ministry as fraudulent on his nationwide television program Last Week Tonight on August 17, 2015. Oliver and his team had corresponded with Tilton's Faith Worldwide Church for seven months; it began when a $20 donation was sent to the organization. Oliver explained what happened during those months: the organization sent a letter back with a $1 bill asking Oliver to \\"send it back\\" with more offerings, leading to a slew of appeals for further donations with nothing substantive in return, according to an account in the Christian Post: Oliver set up his own \\"televangelism\\" megachurch on his broadcast, which he called Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption.

A Norman, he was a member of the cathedral clergy at Rouen before becoming a royal clerk under King William I of England and subsequently his son King William II Rufus. Gerard was appointed Lord Chancellor by William I, and he continued in that office under Rufus, who rewarded him with the Bishopric of Hereford in 1096. Gerard may have been with the king's hunting party when William II was killed, as he is known to have witnessed the first charter issued by the new king, Henry I of England, within days of William's death. Soon after Henry's coronation Gerard was appointed to the recently vacant see of York, and became embroiled in the long-running dispute between York and the see of Canterbury concerning which archbishopric had primacy over England. Gerard managed to secure papal recognition of York's claim to jurisdiction over the church in Scotland, but he was forced to agree to a compromise with his counterpart at Canterbury, Anselm, over Canterbury's claims to authority over York, although it was not binding on his successors. In the Investiture Controversy between the king and the papacy over the right to appoint bishops, Gerard worked on reconciling the claims of the two parties; the controversy was finally resolved in 1107. Gerard was a patron of learning, to the extent that he urged at least one of his clergy to study Hebrew, a language not commonly studied at that time. He himself was a student of astrology, which led to suggestions that he was a magician and a sorcerer. Partly because of such rumours, and his unpopular attempts to reform his cathedral clergy, Gerard was denied a burial inside York Minster after his sudden death in 1108. His successor as archbishop subsequently had Gerard's remains moved into the cathedral church from their initial resting place beside the cathedral porch. Early life and career Gerard was the nephew of Walkelin, Bishop of Winchester, and Simon, Abbot of Ely.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 6: York: Archbishops His parents were Osbert and Anna,Burton \\"Gerard\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and his brother Peter was also a royal clerk.Barlow William Rufus p. 409 The places and times of his birth and upbringing are unknown; he is documented as cantor of Rouen Cathedral, and precentor of the same cathedral, although the dates of his appointments to either office are unrecorded. By 1091 he had become archdeacon of Rouen.Barrow Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 8: Hereford: Bishops He served in the royal chancery under successive kings of England, William I and William II.

Rufus offered to recognise Urban as pope rather than the antipope Clement III in return for Anselm's deposition and the delivery of Anselm's pallium into Rufus' custody, to dispose of as he saw fit. The mission departed for Rome in February 1095 and returned by Whitsun with a papal legate, Walter the Cardinal Bishop of Albano, who had Anselm's pallium. The legate secured Rufus' recognition of Urban, but subsequently refused to consider Anselm's deposition. Rufus resigned himself to Anselm's position as archbishop, and at the king's court at Windsor he consented to Anselm being given the pallium.Vaughn Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan pp. 186‚Äì189 Although not yet ordained, Gerard was rewarded with the Bishopric of Hereford, and he was consecrated by Archbishop Anselm on 8 June 1096;Fryde, et al.

Henry was probably crowned by Maurice, but the medieval chronicler Walter Map states that Gerard crowned Henry in return for a promise of the first vacant archbishopric.Cantor Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture pp. 135‚Äì136 Gerard may have assisted Maurice in the coronation ceremony.Green Henry I p. 43 Archbishop Gerard became Archbishop of York in December 1100.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 281 No source mentions him being invested by the king, but as Anselm urged Pope Paschal II to give Gerard his pallium, which he would have been unlikely to do if Gerard had been invested by Henry, that possibility seems remote.Vaughn Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan p. 222 footnote 36 At Whitsun in 1101 King Henry I, with Anselm's support, deprived Ranulf Flambard, Bishop of Durham, of the lands of the see of Durham, because Ranulf had defected to Henry's elder brother Robert Curthose, who also claimed the English throne. Gerard then deposed Ranulf from his bishopric.Hollister Henry I pp. 135‚Äì136 Soon after his translation to York, Gerard began a long dispute with Anselm, claiming equal primacy with the Archbishop of Canterbury and refusing to make a profession of canonical obedience to Anselm, part of the long Canterbury‚ÄìYork dispute. At the 1102 Council of Westminster, Gerard reportedly kicked over the smaller chair provided for him as Archbishop of York, and refused to be seated until he was provided with one as large as Anselm's.Barlow English Church 1066‚Äì1154 p. 43 He travelled to Rome in 1102 to receive his pallium from the pope, to whom he presented the king's side against Anselm in the controversy surrounding investitures.Vaughn Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan p. 239 The pope decided against the king, but Gerard and two other bishops reported that the pope had assured them that the various papal decrees against the lay investiture of bishops would not be enforced. Their claim was denied by Anselm's representatives and the pope,Barlow English Church 1066‚Äì1154 pp. 299‚Äì300 who excommunicated Gerard until he recanted.Barlow English Church 1066‚Äì1154 p. 301 manuscript illustration of Henry I220px Gerard secured papal recognition of York's metropolitan see for the Scots. He subsequently consecrated Roger as Bishop of Orkney, but refused to consecrate Thurgot to the see of St Andrews because Thurgot would not recognise the primacy of York. Gerard gave generously to the monasteries of his diocese; the medieval chronicler Hugh the Chantor stated that Thomas II, Gerard's successor, accused Gerard of having dissipated the diocese's endowment. King Olaf I of Man and the Isles wrote to \\"G\\", Archbishop of York, asking for the consecration of \\"our bishop\\" by York, but it does not appear to have taken place under Gerard or his successor.Watt \\"Bishops of the Isles\\" Innes Review pp. 110‚Äì111 During the first four years of Henry's reign Gerard was one of the king's chief advisors, along with Robert of Meulan, Count of Meulan in Normandy and later Earl of Leicester. Gerard was one of Henry's greatest supporters among the bishops during the Investiture Crisis.Cantor Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture pp. 238‚Äì249 In 1101 Gerard witnessed a treaty between Henry and Robert, the Count of Flanders, which sought as far as possible to distance Robert from any future conflict between Henry and his elder brother Robert Curthose, or between Henry and King Philip I of France.Green Henry I pp. 61‚Äì62 After Gerard's return from Rome he restored Ranulf Flambard to the see of Durham. In 1102 Anselm refused to consecrate three bishops, two of whom had received investiture from the king; Gerard offered to consecrate them instead, but all except one refused.Cantor Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture pp. 166‚Äì167 From 1105 onwards Gerard slowly began to embrace the papal position on investiture of bishops, which opposed laymen investing bishops with the symbols of episcopal authority. As part of his change of position, Gerard withdrew from court to care for his diocese. Towards the end of 1105 Gerard attempted to join Bohemond of Antioch, who was assembling a crusading force in France, but it appears that King Henry prevented Gerard's departure. In 1106 Gerard wrote to Bohemond that he was still preparing to go on crusade, but he never did.Nicholl Thurstan p. 26 At about the same time, Gerard was working to find a mutually acceptable resolution to the Investiture Crisis, writing a number of letters and other works supporting Anselm's and the pope's position. By 1107 King Henry and Anselm had reached an agreement settling the dispute. Gerard agreed to a compromise on the matter of obedience to Anselm. King Henry proposed that Anselm accept a witnessed oath from Gerard that he would remain bound by the profession he made to Anselm on his consecration as Bishop of Hereford. Gerard made this oath at the Council of Westminster in 1107. It was a victory for Canterbury, but not a complete one, as Gerard avoided making a written profession, and it was specific to Gerard, not to his office.Vaughn Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan pp. 334‚Äì336 Gerard continued to oppose Anselm's attempts to assert Canterbury's primacy, but the two were reconciled before Gerard's death. Gerard also had an uneasy relationship with his cathedral chapter, after attempting to reform his cathedral clergy by forcing them to give up their wives and concubines and become ordained priests. He wrote to Anselm in 1103 complaining of the intransigence of his clergy and envying Anselm's better relations with Canterbury's chapter, which was composed of monks instead of the secular canons who made up York Minster's chapter. In this correspondence, Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy. He also accused them of accepting prebends but refusing to live or work at the cathedral, and of focusing on a narrow legal definition of celibacy without actually being celibate. The canons' argument was that they were only required not to maintain women in their own houses, but they were not forbidden to visit or entertain women in houses belonging to others.Nicholl Thurstan pp. 43‚Äì44 It was not only Gerard who complained about the relationship between himself and his canons; the latter accused Gerard of impoverishing York by making gifts of lands to others.Nicholl Thurstan p. 114 Death and legacy Gerard was an associate of the anonymous author of the Quadripartitus and the Leges Henrici Primi, two 12th-century law books. The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury charged Gerard with immorality, avarice and the practice of magic.Barlow English Church 1066‚Äì1154 p. 72 Gerard encouraged at least one of his clergy to study Hebrew, a language not normally studied at the time.Barlow English Church 1066‚Äì1154 p. 247 Some chroniclers considered his ownership of a Hebrew psalter to be disturbing, seeing it as a sign of heresy or secret Judaism. Among the sins that Malmesbury imputed to him was the study of Julius Firmicus Maternus, a late Roman astrologer, every morning, which to Malmesbury meant that Gerard was a sorcerer.Barlow English Church 1066‚Äì1154 p. 259 Malmesbury further claimed that Gerard was \\"lewd and lustful\\". In Gerard's favour, Anselm regarded him as learned and highly intelligent. Some verses composed by Gerard survive in unpublished form, now in the British Library manuscript collectionSharpe Handlist of Latin Writers pp. 137‚Äì138 as part of manuscript Cotton Titus D.xxiv.Staff \\"Full Description: Cotton Titus D.xxiv\\" Manuscripts Catalogue A collection of his letters circulated in the mid-12th century, part of a bequest made to Bec Abbey in 1164 by Philip de Harcourt, the Bishop of Bayeux, but it is now lost. Gerard died suddenly on 21 May 1108, at Southwell, on his way to London to attend a council. His body was found in an orchard, next to a book of \\"curious arts\\", his copy of Julius Firmicus. His canons refused to allow his burial within his cathedral, but their hostility probably owed more to Gerard's attempts to reform their lifestyle than to his alleged interest in sorcery. Gerard was at first buried beside the porch at York Minster, but his successor, Thomas, moved the remains inside the cathedral church.

The original members were Andrew Kinlochan, Chris Park, Mikey Green, Peter Smith, and Nikk Mager. Between 2003 and 2005 they had four top 20 singles in the UK. They broke up in 2006. Band history In February 2003, they signed to Hyperactive Management, who had previously been successful with Liberty X. In October 2003 they released their first single, \\"Hold on Me\\", on the Concept Records label, which charted at number 10 in the UK, selling over 60,000 copies. March 2004 saw the release of their second single, \\"Love Revolution\\". This sold over 50,000 copies and charted at number 13. The videos and dance routines for their first two singles aroused media attention for their content, as they often featured the band topless or naked, often in sexually suggestive and aggressive situations with other men. The third single, released in June 2004, was a cover of Duran Duran's \\"Wild Boys\\". During the release week, one version of the single was disqualified from the chart for being a few seconds too long, so the single dropped from the midweek chart position of 9, to number 23; however, an appeal was made to the chart regulators and both versions were eventually counted, giving a final position of number 12. The single sold over 65,000 copies. Just after the release of \\"Wild Boys\\", Peter Smith announced he was leaving to pursue a solo career and to give him more time to write music. In autumn 2004 Phixx toured South Africa, where they were already popular. They released their debut album, Electrophonic Revolution, there and it became the best- selling album for their South African record company Sheer Music. The band co- wrote some of the songs for the album with Lee Ryan from Blue, Brian McFadden (formerly of Westlife), Alistair Griffin, Ultra, and Theo from Liberty X. All the tracks were produced by John McLaughlin, who had previously worked with Busted. In December 2004, the band recorded a Christmas song written by Matt Baker for the children's show Blue Peter. This song was available as a free download from the Blue Peter website in the weeks leading up to Christmas, but was never released for sale. In January 2005, they released their fourth UK single, \\"Strange Love\\" (written by Judie Tzuke), which entered the UK Singles Chart at number 19. In May 2005, Nikk Mager also left the band. They continued to perform around England and Ireland as a three piece, and spent six months in the recording studio, writing and recording new material. In November 2005, Chris Park announced that the remaining members of Phixx would be breaking up for good in 2006, in order to work on their own solo projects. Band members made appearances on the music panel game, Never Mind the Buzzcocks. Green appeared on the show in 2004, followed by Park a year later. Both appeared as panellists on Phill Jupitus' team. In 2006, fellow band member Mager appeared in the Identity Parade line-up, where the panellists were asked to pick out a forgotten star from a group of five. In 2008, Mager also appeared in the audition stage of The X Factor, but he was eliminated after his performance of \\"The Rose\\". Phixx appeared at number 35 in Chantelle's Top 50 Reality TV Stars. Like Liberty X, who were formed from the runners up on the first series of Popstars, Phixx had a much longer career than the male winners of Popstars: The Rivals, One True Voice, who split up in 2003 after releasing just two singles. Phixx by contrast were active until 2006, and released several singles and an LP during their time together. In 2013, Peter Smith appeared on The Voice of Ireland, but none of the coaches turned their chairs for him.

The lead vocalist in popular music is typically the member of a group or band whose voice is the most prominent melody in a performance where multiple voices may be heard. The lead singer sets their voice against the accompaniment parts of the ensemble as the dominant sound. In vocal group performances, notably in soul and gospel music, and early rock and roll, the lead singer takes the main vocal melody, with a chorus or harmony vocals provided by other band members as backing vocalists. Lead vocalists typically incorporate some movement or gestures into their performance, and some may participate in dance routines during the show, particularly in pop music. Some lead vocalists also play an instrument during the show, either in an accompaniment role (such as strumming a guitar part), or playing a lead instrument/instrumental solo role when they are not singing (as in the case of lead singer-guitar virtuoso Jimi Hendrix). The lead singer also typically guides the vocal ensemble and band with visual cues to indicate changes of tempo or dynamics, stops or pauses, and the starts of new sections (unless there is also a conductor onstage, as with a big band or unless an instrumentalist bandleader is providing this role). The lead vocalist also typically speaks to the audience between songs, to give information about the songs (such as who wrote them or why it was chosen), introduce the band members, and develop a rapport with the audience. The lead vocalist may also play a leadership role in rehearsals, unless there is a bandleader who takes on this role. If the lead singer is a singer-songwriter, she or he may write some or all of the lyrics or create entire songs (including chords and melodies). An example of a lead vocalist in rock music is Freddie Mercury from Queen. Similarly in soul music, Smokey Robinson was the lead singer of The Miracles. There may be two or more lead vocalists in a band, as with Fleetwood Mac or ABBA. Terminology The lead vocalist may also be called the main vocalist, lead vocals, or lead singer. Especially in rock music, the lead singer or solo singer is often the front man or front woman, who may also play one or more instruments and is often seen as the leader or spokesman of the band by the public. History Queen performs in a typical rock band layout during a 1984 concert. Lead singer (front man) Freddie Mercury stands centre- stage in front of drummer Roger Taylor and positioned between bass guitarist John Deacon and lead guitarist Brian May. It is uncertain when the term \\"lead vocals\\" was first used, but it may have emerged in the late 1930s, when rich vocal interplay with multiple voices where one or more voices may dominate began to impact on North American popular music, which was previously dominated by solo vocals. The practice of using a lead singer in vocal groups, however, has a longer history: an early form is the \\"call and response\\" found in work songs and spirituals sung by African-American slaves. Songs of the late nineteenth century frequently used a leading solo voice (or \\"call\\"), followed by a choral response by other singers. As the style developed through early commercial recordings and performances in the early 20th century, the role of the lead vocalist became more established, although popular groups of the 1930s and 1940s such as the Ink Spots and the Mills Brothers generally used different lead singers on different songs rather than keeping the same lead singer throughout. By the 1950s, singers such as Sam Cooke (with the Soul Stirrers) and Clyde McPhatter (with the Drifters) took on more clearly defined roles as lead singers, and by the end of the decade credited group names often changed to reflect the leading roles of the main vocalists, with examples such as Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers and Dion & the Belmonts.David Horn, '\\"Lead Singer\\", in Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Volume II: Performance and Production, A&C; Black, 2003, pp.103‚Äì104 Academic David Horn has written: > The influence of US rhythm and blues recordings may well be a crucial one in > the assimilation of the format of lead singer plus backing group into the > guitar-based British 'beat' groups of the 1960s, and in US groups such as > The Beach Boys. From these various points ‚Äì including Motown ‚Äì it went on to > become a standard device in much rock and pop music. In some bands ‚Äì most > famously, The Beatles ‚Äì the role of lead singer alternated (in this case, > principally between two performers), while in others ‚Äì for example, Herman's > Hermits ‚Äì one lead singer dominated. Characteristics and exceptions in rock and pop music There are as many types and styles of lead singer as there are styles and genres of music. However, the lead singer of a group or band is usually the main focus of audiences' attention.\\"Role of the Lead Vocalist\\", Vocalist.org.uk. Accessed 2 May 2015 The lead vocalist of band is sometimes called the \\"front man\\" or \\"front woman\\", as the most visible performer in a group. While most bands have a singular lead singer, many others have dual lead singers, or other member of the band that occasionally sing lead on particular songs. While the lead singer often defines the group's image and personality to the general public, this is not always the case. In modern rock music, the lead singer is often, but not always, also the band's leader and spokesperson. While lead singers or spokespersons for any musical ensembles can be called a front man, the term is used very widely in rock music. Since the position commonly has an expanded role from simple lead vocalists, there have been cases in which the front man for a band is someone other than the lead vocalist. For example, while the lead vocalist for the band Fall Out Boy is guitarist Patrick Stump, the bassist and lyricist, Pete Wentz, is generally called the front man, both in the media and by the band members themselves, since he represents the band in most interviews and contributes most to the band's image in the popular media.CARAMANICA, JON (12 December 2008), \\"The Frontman in the Background\\". The New York Times. (accessed 19 January 2009) Another example is Angus Young of AC/DC, who is the band's lead guitarist, and co-leader with his brother Malcolm Young (until the latter's death in 2017); while lead singer Brian Johnson (and before him Bon Scott) is the band's front man, Angus Young can be thought to share the front man position with Johnson, due to his on-stage antics and his role as the band's mascot, frequently featuring on album covers and promotional materials. In many bands, such as The Who, Led Zeppelin, Living Colour, Queen, The Stone Roses and Oasis, the lead guitarist may share spokesman responsibilities with the lead singer. Usually, this is derived from that guitarist's specific role as a co-songwriter, co-founder and/or co- vocalist. Also in some cases, there are two frontmen, such as Alice in Chains, with singer Layne Staley (and later William DuVall) sharing vocal duties with guitarist Jerry Cantrell, or Underoath, with singers Spencer Chamberlain and Aaron Gillespie (drummer) sharing vocal duties. Another example is Blink-182, in which vocal duties are split between bassist Mark Hoppus and guitarist Tom DeLonge. Hoppus usually carries out most media either by himself or together with DeLonge, while the band's other member, drummer Travis Barker, usually remains quiet. Linkin Park had two vocalists as well, Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington, both considered as frontmen. Another example is the thrash metal band Metallica, in which James Hetfield (lead singer and rhythm guitarist) and Lars Ulrich (drummer) share the spokesperson duties for being both founders and the only members who have never left the band. Some lead vocalists started out as backup vocalists. No Doubt at first had John Spence on lead vocals and Gwen Stefani on backing vocals. After Spence died by suicide, Stefani took over on lead vocals.

After Phillips recorded From Genesis to Revelation and Trespass with the band, he left in July 1970 and learned to play more instruments before he began a solo career. Phillips released his first solo album, The Geese & the Ghost, in 1977. He continues to release solo albums, including further solo albums, television and film music, collaborations with several artists, and compilation albums of his recordings.  Early life  Phillips was born on 23 December 1951 in Chiswick, West London. He attended a preparatory school, during which he formed a group and took part in a performance of \\"My Old Man's a Dustman\\" in the school hut as the singer, but forgot the words during it and was kicked out. This led to his decision to learn the guitar. He learned enough and soon performed lead guitar to a rendition of \\"Foot Tapper\\" by The Shadows in the school lounge. The Shadows were a major influence for Phillips in terms of acoustic guitar. At thirteen Phillips acquired a Stratocaster and wrote the basis of his first song, \\"Patricia\\", named after the first girl he liked. Part of the song was recorded later by Genesis on \\"In Hiding\\". He was not entirely a self-taught guitar player; he received some tuition in rudimentary chords from classical guitarist David Channon, who became a big source of inspiration for Phillips, and used sheet music to songs by The Beatles that his mother would send him. Phillips then picked up more chord knowledge, and learned to copy \\"reasonably well\\". As a teenager, Phillips briefly lived in the United States. In April 1965, Phillips attended Charterhouse, an independent school in Godalming, Surrey. In the following month, he formed a band with fellow pupils Rivers Jobe, Richard Macphail, Mike Rutherford, and Rob Tyrell, naming themselves Anon. They based their sets on songs by The Beatles and The Rolling Stones and recorded one demo, Phillips's song \\"Pennsylvania Flickhouse\\". The group disbanded in December 1966.  Career = 1967‚Äì1974: Genesis and hiatus = In January 1967, after Anon had split up, Phillips and Rutherford became a songwriting unit and started recording several demos. They soon invited Charterhouse pupil Tony Banks, a member of Garden Wall, another disbanded school group, to play keyboards. Banks agreed, and suggested to involve his Garden Wall bandmate, singer Peter Gabriel. After the five made a demo tape, it was given to Jonathan King, who signed them to his publishing company and had them record some singles. He soon named the group Genesis, and suggested they record a studio album which became From Genesis to Revelation. Phillips was particularly angry when King added string arrangements to their songs without their knowledge. In September 1969, the 17-year-old Phillips chose not to pursue a university degree and instead, reunited with Gabriel, Banks, and Rutherford after they had decided to become a full-time band. Early in 1970, however, the constant touring had come wearing on Phillips partly due to the little room for solos in the band's set and the little time to develop new material. To further matters he had developed stage fright which got progressively worse as time went on, and battled with it for three months thinking it was a passing phase. After falling ill with bronchial pneumonia, Phillips was advised by his doctor to quit the band and recover. In June 1970, Phillips had recovered enough to reunite with his bandmates and record their second album, Trespass. Despite his various problems at the time Phillips enjoyed the recording sessions. After recording finished in July the band resumed touring, though early into the tour Phillips announced his decision to quit. His final gig took place at Haywards Heath on 18 July. Banks and Rutherford later said that the group seriously considered quitting altogether in the wake of Phillips's departure. Nursery Cryme, the next Genesis album, opens with \\"The Musical Box\\" which is based on a piece written by Phillips and Rutherford originally titled \\"F#\\" (pronounced \\"F Sharp\\"). After leaving Genesis, Phillips became \\"a bit of a lost soul\\" without a solid direction. He recalled listening to Jean Sibelius around the time of his departure and recognised his musical ability was \\"terribly limited\\", which encouraged him to become a more proficient musician. In 1974, he became a qualified music teacher and gave lessons to students. By 1977, he was playing classical guitar and piano, and studied orchestration. = 1974‚Äìpresent: Solo career = After leaving Genesis, Phillips studied classical music (especially classical guitar) and made recordings in collaboration with Harry Williamson, Mike Rutherford and Phil Collins, among others. He played the keyboards on the demos for Peter Gabriel in 1976. His first solo album, The Geese & the Ghost, was issued in 1977. He released his second album, Wise After the Event, in 1978. This was followed the next year by Sides. Both of these albums were produced by Rupert Hine and were intended to reach a mainstream audience, though neither album was successful in that regard. In its initial release in the UK, Sides was accompanied by a more experimental album entitled Private Parts & Pieces; in the US and Canada the two albums were issued separately. Private Parts & Pieces II: Back to the Pavilion followed the next year, and several further sequels were issued in the 1980s and 1990s. Phillips began writing material with Andrew Latimer of Camel in 1981, and was a featured performer on that band's album, The Single Factor (released in 1982). Phillips released a mainstream pop album entitled Invisible Men in 1983. He later claimed that this project went \\"horribly wrong\\" as a result of commercial pressures, and would subsequently eschew mainstream success in favour of more specialised material. He co-wrote \\"Tears on the Ballroom Floor\\" for I Hear Talk by Bucks Fizz. Since leaving Genesis, Phillips has remained continuously involved in a variety of musical projects, including extensive soundtrack work in England, often for the label Atmosphere, part of the Universal Music Group. In the mid-1990s, he released an album entitled The Living Room Concert, which featured solo acoustic versions of his earlier material. He also provided archival material for the first Genesis box set, Genesis Archive 1967‚Äì75, released in 1998. Several of his albums feature artwork by Peter Cross. In 2008, the first Anthony Phillips biography, The Exile, by journalist Mario Giammetti, was published in Italy (Edizioni Segno). Harvest of the Heart, a 5-CD Box Set chronicling Phillips' solo career and collaborations, was released in 2014.

This is in contrast to games where players compete against computer-controlled opponents and/or players, which is referred to as player versus environment (PvE). The terms are most often used in games where both activities exist, particularly MMORPGs, MUDs, and other role-playing video games. PvP can be broadly used to describe any game, or aspect of a game, where players compete against each other. PvP is often controversial when used in role-playing games. In most cases, there are vast differences in abilities between experienced and novice players. PvP can even encourage experienced players to immediately attack and kill inexperienced players. PvP is sometimes called player killing. History PvP combat in CRPGs has its roots in various MUDs like Gemstone II and Avalon: The Legend Lives.. However, while the ability to kill another player existed in many MUDs, it was usually frowned upon because of general strict adherences and heavy influences from tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. The term PvP originated in text based MUDs played on bulletin board systems like MajorMUD and Usurper. These games had open worlds where any player could attack any other player as long as they were not at a safe spot in town like the Bank. Player versus player was coined sometime in the late 1980s to refer to the combat between players that resulted in the loser being penalized in some way. The first graphical MMORPG was Neverwinter Nights, which began development in 1989 and ran on AOL 1991‚Äì1997, and which included PvP. PvP was initially limited to magical attacks in the game. Later modifications expanded its use to limited areas so that players who wished to avoid it could do so. Much of the PvP activity was coordinated events by the game's guilds, which were the first such organized user groups in MMORPG's. Genocide, an LPMud launched in 1992, was a pioneer in PvP conflict as the first \\"pure PK\\" MUD, removing all non-PvP gameplay and discarding the RPG- style character development normally found in MUDs in favor of placing characters on an even footing, with only player skill providing an advantage. Extremely popular, its ideas influenced the MUD world heavily. Other early MMORPGs, including Meridian 59 (1996), Ultima Online (1997), and Tibia (1997) also had PvP combat as a feature. In Ultima Online, the goal was to allow players to police themselves in a \\"frontier justice\\" way. This system also exists in Tibia, where death includes significant penalty, and killing someone inflicts considerable harm to their character. In Meridian 59, the game tried to focus PvP by having different political factions for players to join. The later Eve Online (2003) refined Ultima Online's (original) approach of \\"PvP anywhere but in town\\" (where attacking another player is dangerous in and around towns due to interference from NPC \\"guards\\"). However, these games tended to be unfriendly to more casual players. With the popularity of EverQuest in 1999, primarily consisting of PvE elements (with the exception of limited PvP on one specific server), PvP became a negative for some newer/casual MMORPG players and developers looking to draw a larger crowd. In 2000, in response to complaints about malicious player-killers, Ultima Online controversially added an extra copy of the game world to each server in which open PvP was disabled. In addition to this, not all PvP games feature a players' avatar experiencing death. An example of this type of PvP element can be found on MMOs such as Audition Online (2004) where while players are not directly killing each other's avatars as traditionally found in MMOs, they are still competing against each other during certain game modes in a Player versus Player setting. PvP has been included in other games such as Asheron's Call in late 1999, Diablo II in 2000, Dark Age of Camelot and RuneScape in 2001, Asheron's Call 2 in 2002, Shadowbane in 2003, and Dragon Nest in 2011. While these games included PvP, they still contained large portions of prerequisite PvE, mostly to build characters. Classifications=Player killing= Player killing, or PKing, is unrestricted PvP resulting in a character's death. Some games offer open PvP (also sometimes called world PvP), where one player can attack another without warning anywhere in the game world. A pure PK game is one where PvP conflict is the only gameplay offered. Ganking (short for gang killing) is a type of PKing in which the killer has a significant advantage over his victim, such as being part of a group, being a higher level, or attacking the victim while they are at low health. PvP can also create additional facets in the community. In Ultima Online and Asheron's Call, a rift formed between those who enjoyed PKing, those who enjoyed hunting the PKs and those who simply did not want to fight at all. The Renaissance expansion later added a Trammel facet where PvP was not allowed, giving some out to the UO crowd that did not wish to engage in PvP at all. Asheron's Call contained a server that was completely unrestricted in player interactions where massive \\"PK\\" and \\"Anti (PK)\\" dynasties formed. Character death in an online game usually comes with a penalty (though some games remove it from PvP combat), so habitual PKers can find themselves ostracized by the local community. In some games a character will die many times and the player must often sacrifice some experience points (XP) or in-game currency to restore that character to life. Permanent death (such that the player must create a new character) is relatively uncommon in online games, especially if PKing is permitted. An example of such a mode is Hardcore mode on the game Diablo II. A rarer form of player killing involves inciting a monster or monsters to attack another player. The reason this is rare is because the monster is more likely to attack the one who is trying to do the killing. Often a player will have to lure the monster towards the other player and run away, so that the monster (if it is aggressive) will look for a new target, which may be the other player. This behavior is often found in otherwise purely 'PVE' games such as Realm of the Mad God. In some MMORPGs PvP comes with extra penalties such as the player killer will not be able to form/join a group (party), receive help from other players and may have an increased loss of experience on death. Usually a player's name who has initiated a PvP recently will be in a bright color. In Lineage II a player would turn purple if they initiated combat and anyone who killed someone who was not purple (had fought back) would turn red. Turning red had a much higher chance of one's gear dropping off for others to loot when they die. Arguably the most severe penalty came on Asheron's Call where a killed player incurred a 5% loss in all stats and abilities per death, stacking up to 40%. This, combined with probably being naked from item loss, was very difficult to come back from. Some MMORPGs set a certain level requirement to engage in PvP combat in order for new players to enjoy, experience and explore the game before actually getting PK'ed by other players. Other MMORPGs, such as Anarchy Online and Everquest Original on the 'Zek' servers, only allow a player to PvP with another if they are within a certain level range of each other, to prevent \\"ganking\\" (see above). Anti- player killing Anti-PKing, also known as Player Killer Killing, PK Killing, or PKK, is a form of in-game player justice. Often motivated by an overpopulation of in-game player killers, vigilante Anti-PKs hunt Player Killers and Player Griefers with vengeance. =Dueling= Dueling is both voluntary and competitive. Dueling ladders and leagues set up by fans are common for most MMORPGs that have PvP. Dark Age of Camelot was the first graphical MMORPG to debut a formal dueling system ingame (Ballista); other MMORPGs such as City of Heroes, Anarchy Online, World of Warcraft, Guild Wars, Lineage 2, Wurm Online, and RuneScape feature PvP as competitive dueling in a group setting. =Flagging= Through various means, \\"flags\\" can be turned on or off, allowing PvP combat with other people who have also turned on their flag. In Everquest, there is no way to turn the flag off once it has been turned on. In Star Wars Galaxies, the flag may be turned off by interacting with faction specific NPCs located throughout the game or by typing an ingame command (/pvp). In World of Warcraft, flagging is selectable or can be activated by attacking certain flagged players until a cool-off period ends, though this can be exploited by griefers via corpse camping. Some games have a bounty system where players that kill or heal other players open themselves up to being killed in return. This is sometimes called the \\"revenge flag\\". Use of this 'bounty' system is not standardized among MMORPGs, and there are debates raging about how to 'police' the system to avoid abuse. Sometimes the PvP flag gets automatically 'ON' on any player who initiates a PK. Other players who attacks a player who has the PvP flag on will NOT get their PvP flag 'ON'. RvR (realm versus realm) combat In 2001, Mythic Entertainment introduced a new team-based form of PvP combat with the release of Dark Age of Camelot. In RvR, players of each realm team up to fight against players from the opposing realms in team-based combat. This can include normal skirmishes between rival groups that is common in other PvP systems, but also consists of objective- based battles such as taking and holding keeps or capturing enemy relics. This was a new concept to graphical MMORPGs, but was first introduced in the game that preceded DAoC, Darkness Falls: The Crusade, which has since been shut down in favor of building on DAoC. Other MMORPG games now also feature this type of gameplay.  PvP in tabletop roleplaying games  Tabletop roleplaying games have also often featured PvP action. These are usually considered a reasonable part of play so long as the fight is based on \\"in-character\\" reasons. Games are often written so player characters will not be unbalanced, ensuring that the players are genuinely scared of the other players, even when they would normally kill most non-player characters easily. This approach to PvP in tabletop games is not universal. For example, in the highly satirical Paranoia, lethal PvP conflict is a core game element, considered normal and heavily encouraged by the rules and support materials.  Ethical issues  Player-vs-player dynamics involve ethical issues with players. Because of ganking, some game developers view PvP with contempt. Despite the advantage experienced players have over new players, many game developers have assumed an honor code would prevent PKing.

He made extensive statistical studies of the stars in our galaxy and their positions and motions, and tried to develop a model of the galaxy based on this. He proposed the siriometer as a unit of stellar distance. Charlier was also interested in pure statistics and played a role in the development of statistics in Swedish academia. Several of his pupils became statisticians, working at universities and in government and companies. Related to his work on galactic structure, he also developed a cosmological theory based on the work of Johann Heinrich Lambert. In the resulting Lambert-Charlier Hierarchical Cosmology, increasingly large areas of space contain decreasing densities of matter, the principle being introduced to avoid the observational inconsistency that would otherwise emerge from Olbers Paradox.

The Roma Street Parkland is adjacent to Brisbane Transit Centre and the Roma Street railway station from which it takes its name (the park does not directly face onto Roma Street) There is pedestrian access to the Roma Street Parkland from the Roma Street railway station, as well as from Albert Street, and from the section of the Parkland which used to be called Albert Park, in Wickham Terrace. There is also a car park area, with road access from the intersection between Wickham Terrace, College Road and Gregory Terrace. Roma Street Parkland is the world's largest subtropical garden in a city centre. The parkland features a variety of themed gardens and recreational areas, with a web of pathways and boardwalks traversing cascading waterways and rocky outcrops, and also in situ artworks by 16 local artists. History of Roma Street Parkland area Local Indigenous people used the area for thousands of years conducting meetings and ceremonies. In 1825 the Roma Street Parkland area was part of the original Brisbane settlement. In 1875 a railway terminal station in Roma Street was constructed as part of the Main Line railway linking Brisbane to Ipswich and Toowoomba. The terminal grew to become a major goods yard for Brisbane and, between 1911 and 1934, the area was extensively redeveloped to support its increase in services. In 1920 extensive excavation, removing 554,300 cubic meters of earth, permanently altered the steep terrain creating the current day artificial escarpment and the boundary of the former Albert Park. During World War II, the terminal was vital for transporting war materials and military personnel north. Continuing to grow, the Roma Street railway station was redeveloped to service a metropolitan and long-distance train network. Because of limitations of the site revealed through the increasing mechanization of freight handling and the use of containers, the facility was eventually relocated to Acacia Ridge in 1991. In February 1995, State Premier Wayne Goss announced the railway goods yard would be redeveloped as parkland.Roma Street - Park and Offices Sunshine Express April 1975 page 374 Construction began in 2000 with the parkland opened to the public in 2001.

It was originally published in 1987; a revised edition appeared in 2007. Sowell's opening chapter attempts to answer the question of why the same people tend to be political adversaries in issue after issue, when the issues vary enormously in subject matter and sometimes hardly seem connected to one another. The root of these conflicts, Sowell claims, are the \\"visions\\", or the intuitive feelings that people have about human nature; different visions imply radically different consequences for how they think about everything from war to justice. The rest of the book describes two basic visions, the \\"constrained\\" and \\"unconstrained\\" visions, which are thought to capture opposite ends of a continuum of political thought on which one can place many contemporary Westerners, in addition to their intellectual ancestors of the past few centuries. The book could be compared with George Lakoff's 1996 book Moral Politics, which aims to answer a very similar question. Sowell's book has been published both with and without the subtitle \\"Ideological Origins of Political Struggles\\". Steven Pinker's book The Blank Slate calls Sowell's explanation the best theory given to date. In this book, Pinker refers to the \\"constrained vision\\" as the \\"tragic vision\\" and the \\"unconstrained vision\\" as the \\"utopian vision\\". The competing visions Sowell lays out these concepts in his A Conflict of Visions, and The Vision of the Anointed. These two visions encompass a range of ideas and theories. =The unconstrained vision= Sowell argues that the unconstrained vision relies heavily on the belief that human nature is essentially good. Those with an unconstrained vision distrust decentralized processes and are impatient with large institutions and systemic processes that constrain human action. They believe there is an ideal solution to every problem, and that compromise is never acceptable. Collateral damage is merely the price of moving forward on the road to perfection. Sowell often refers to them as \\"the self anointed.\\" Ultimately they believe that man is morally perfectible. Because of this, they believe that there exist some people who are further along the path of moral development, have overcome self-interest and are immune to the influence of power and therefore can act as surrogate decision- makers for the rest of society. =The constrained vision= Sowell argues that the constrained vision relies heavily on belief that human nature is essentially unchanging and that man is naturally inherently self-interested, regardless of the best intentions. Those with a constrained vision prefer the systematic processes of the rule of law and experience of tradition. Compromise is essential because there are no ideal solutions, only trade-offs. Those with a constrained vision favor solid empirical evidence and time-tested structures and processes over intervention and personal experience. Ultimately, the constrained vision demands checks and balances and refuses to accept that all people could put aside their innate self-interest.For helpful discussion of Sowell's dualistic ideological model, see Joseph G. Conti and Brad Stetson, Challenging the Civil Rights Establishment: Profiles of a New Black Vanguard, (Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 1993, pp. 85122).

The channel was founded as the Canadian version of the U.S. channel Bravo (which is now owned by NBCUniversal) on January 1, 1995, and originally focused on performing arts, drama, and independent film. As with its U.S. counterpart, the channel has dropped its arts programming but unlike its U.S. counterpart, which shifted to female- targeting reality and lifestyle-oriented series, the Canadian channel adopted a general entertainment format with a focus on drama. In 2012, Bravo was relaunched under a new logo and separate branding from its former American counterpart. Seven years later, the channel would rebrand again under its current name on September 12, 2019. History In the 1980s, a precursor to Bravo existed called C Channel. The service was a national commercial-free pay television channel that focused on arts programming. C Channel launched on February 1, 1983, before it went bankrupt and ceased operations five months later on June 30 of that year due to its inability to attract a sufficient number of subscribers at a price of $16 per month. Bravo logo used from 1995 to 2012 Over 10 years later, another attempt at an arts-based channel was proposed when CHUM Limited applied to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for a license to operate Bravo. In June 1994, CHUM's application for Bravo was approved, citing its nature of service as focusing on \\"performance and drama programming, as well as documentary and discussion\\".CRTC Decision 1994-281 Bravo was launched on January 1, 1995, at 3pm, with an introductory slide of a letter from Moses Znaimer explaining how Bravo was intended to help show that TV was not \\"a monumental waste of time\\", as he claimed most people thought of it, followed by their first program, the BBC documentary TV Is King. It focused on arts programming, including music, ballet, literature, television and film drama, visual arts, modern dance, opera and architecture. Facilities for the network, including a small studio constructed especially for acoustic performances, were housed in an addition to the CHUMCity Building at 299 Queen Street West in Toronto, and much like Citytv and MuchMusic, utilized unconventional branding and programming (hence the original slogan for the network, NewStyleArtsChannel), and the network had 3 branded vehicles to be used in covering news about the arts. Canadian actress and artist Marilyn Lightstone, longtime partner of Moses Znaimer, served as the channel's primary voiceover throughout the CHUM era. As a condition of licence, Bravo was to contribute a predetermined amount or percentage of its revenues to ArtsFACT (now called Bravo!FACT), a fund established to provide grants for the production of Canadian short films covering a wide range of arts-related disciplines. Films funded by Bravo!FACT have regularly aired on the channel. =Sale to CTVglobemedia/Bell Media= Bravo HD logo used from 2011 to 2012. In July 2006, Bell Globemedia (later called CTVglobemedia) announced that it would purchase CHUM for an estimated CAD$1.7 billion, included in the sale was BravoBell Globemedia acquires CHUM ; Fasken Martineau; 2006-07-12 The sale was approved by the CRTC on June 8, 2007,Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2007-165; CRTC; 2007-06-08 and the transaction was completed on June 22, 2007 while the Citytv stations were sold to Rogers Media. After CTVglobemedia's purchase of Bravo, the channel increasingly shifted its focus toward more television and film dramas (such as Criminal Minds), and lessened its focus on arts programming. On September 10, 2010, BCE Inc. (a minority shareholder in CTVglobemedia) announced that it planned to acquire 100% interest in CTVglobemedia for a total debt and equity transaction cost of $3.2 billion.

Bravo's final on air logo, used from 2012 to 2019. While under Bell Media ownership, the shift toward television and film dramas and general entertainment programming was expanded upon, although it still carries some arts-related programming as a condition of its licence. This format shift was further emphasized on May 14, 2012, when Bravo unveiled a new on-air logo and new on-air presentation as part of an extensive rebranding of the network. The new logo dropped the original \\"square\\" logo that Bravo had maintained since its launch (which resembled the 1993 to 2003 logo used by the U.S. channel), in favour of a design no longer resembling any logo used by its American counterpart. Many changes also include that the channel decided to de-emphasize arts-related programming in favor of comedy-related programming, including Odd Job Jack. On June 6, 2013, Bell announced that Bravo would become the company's first network to implement a TV Everywhere service, which would allow subscribers of participating television service providers that carry Bravo to stream video on demand content as well as a live feed of the Bravo channel via the Bravo Go app. On June 7, 2018, during the CTV upfronts, it was announced that Bravo would be re-branded as \\"CTV Drama\\", as part of a re-branding of several Bell Media specialty channels under the CTV name. The following year, it was revealed the channel would rebrand as CTV Drama Channel on September 12, 2019. Bell also announced a commitment to order 20 made-for-TV film adaptations of Harlequin novels from Harlequin Studios, which will air on CTV Drama Channel and Vrak. Programming Presently, CTV Drama Channel airs a mix of cable dramas acquired from networks such as TNT, USA Network, and Hulu, as well as reruns of Canadian-produced shows to fulfill Canadian content quotas. In its early years as Bravo, the channel often aired short films by Canadian artists between programs, funded by its foundation Bravo!FACT, which ranged from comedy to drama to opera to jazz to animation. Many of these also aired on Bravo's weekly series Bravo!FACT Presents. Bravo has also produced a limited amount of scripted and non-scripted series and has broadcast many notable specials, including a telecast of Canadian rock band Spirit of the West's Open Heart Symphony concert with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, and three early television films within the Murdoch Mysteries franchise: Except the Dying, Poor Tom Is Cold and Under the Dragon's Tail. =As CTV Drama Channel=Current Programming * Asteroid in Love * Bones * Carter * The Closer * Criminal Minds * CSI: Crime Scene Investigation * Flashpoint * The Handmaid's Tale * House * In the Dark * Killing Eve * Law & Order: Special Victims Unit * The Rookie * Transplant =As Bravo=Final Programming * 19-2 (English-Language version) * Arts & Minds * At the Concert Hall * The Borgias * Bravo!FACT Presents * Bravo!NEWS * Bravo!

The unstable combustion results in variations of engine thrust, causing variations of acceleration on the vehicle's flexible structure, which in turn cause variations in propellant pressure and flow rate, closing the self-excitation cycle. The name is a metaphor comparing the longitudinal vibration to the bouncing of a pogo stick. Pogo oscillation places stress on the frame of the vehicle, which in severe cases can be dangerous.  Origin  In general, pogo oscillation occurs when a surge in engine pressure increases back pressure against the fuel coming into the engine, reducing engine pressure, causing more fuel to come in and increasing engine pressure again. Flexing of fuel pipes can also induce fluctuations in fuel pressure. If the cycle happens to match a resonance frequency of the rocket then dangerous oscillations can occur through positive feedback, which can, in extreme cases, tear the vehicle apart. Another situation in which pogo oscillation will occur is when the engine is moving longitudinally with fluctuating speed. Owing to inertia, if the speed of the vehicle suddenly increases, the fuel inside the fuel tank tends to \\"fall behind\\" and is forced into the turbopump, a situation somewhat similar to the slosh of liquid inside a tanker. This creates excess pressure to the turbopump and causes unintended excessive fuel to be delivered. This in turn creates excessive thrust and causes the vehicle to accelerate which leads to further increase in turbopump pressure and an unintended increase in fuel delivery. This can set up a vicious circle, and can result in structural failure in the vehicle. The most famous pogo oscillation was in the Saturn V first stage, S-IC, on the flight of Apollo 6 caused by the cruciform thrust structure. This structure was an \\"X\\" of two I-beams, with an engine on the end of each beam and the center engine at the intersection of the beams. The center of the cruciform was unsupported, so the central F-1 engine caused the structure to bend upwards. The pogo oscillation occurred when this structure sprang back, lengthening the center engine's fuel line bellows (which was mounted down the center of the cruciform), temporarily reducing the fuel flow and thus reducing thrust. At the other end of the oscillation, the fuel line was compressed, increasing fuel flow. This caused a sinusoidal thrust oscillation during the first stage ascent.  Hazard  If the oscillation is left unchecked, failures can result. One case occurred in the middle J-2 engine of the second stage, S-II, of the Apollo 13 lunar mission in 1970. In this case, the engine shut down before the oscillations could cause damage to the vehicle. Later events in this mission (an oxygen tank exploded two days later) overshadowed the pogo problem. Pogo also had been experienced in the S-IC first stage of the unmanned Apollo 6 test flight in 1968. One of the Soviet Union's N1-L3 rocket test flights suffered pogo oscillations in the first stage on February 21, 1969. The launch vehicle reached initial engine cutoff, but exploded 107 seconds after liftoff and disintegrated. There are other cases during unmanned launches in the 1950s and 1960s where the pogo effect caused catastrophic launch failures. Modern vibration analysis methods can account for the pogo oscillation to ensure that it is far away from the vehicle's resonant frequencies. Suppression methods include damping mechanisms or bellows in propellant lines. The Space Shuttle main engines each had a damper in the LOX line, but not in the hydrogen fuel line.

After Geoffrey became a bishop, the king chose to keep the office of chancellor vacant until the king's death. The functions of the office were performed by the head of the scriptorium, Robert de Sigello.Green Government of England p. 27 Rufus was nominated to the see of Durham about 14 May 1133, and consecrated on 6 August 1133.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 241 He was enthroned on 10 August 1133. The see had been vacant since 1128. Geoffrey at first quarrelled with his cathedral chapter, but peace was restored when the bishop allowed the monks their privileges. Geoffrey also was a benefactor to Newminster Abbey. During Rufus' episcopate the chapterhouse at Durham was completed. Rufus also employed as a clerk William Cumin, who after Rufus' death conspired with King David I of Scotland to seize the see of Durham. When King Stephen took the thone at the death of King Henry, Rufus acknowledged Stephen as king, but did not attend the royal court often. In 1136, a peace treaty between King David and King Stephen was signed at Durham, but in 1138 Rufus' castle of Norham surrendered to King David, an act that brought condemnation to the bishop for failing to defend the castle adequately. Geoffrey, however, refused David's offer to return Norham to Geoffrey in return for repudiating Stephen. In retaliation, Norham was destroyed. Geoffrey does not seem to have supported either side at the Battle of the Standard in August 1138. At the end of Rufus' life, because of King David's invasion of northern England in support of the Empress Matilda, most of the diocese was under the control of the Scottish king.Huscroft Ruling England p. 134 Rufus died on 6 May 1141.

Initial construction of the station finished in 1968. The station, like the other U.S. Antarctic stations, is operated by the United States Antarctic Program (USAP) of the National Science Foundation. The base is about as distant from the equator as Fairbanks, Alaska.  Description  The station is named for Nathaniel B. Palmer, usually recognized as the first American to see Antarctica. The maximum population that Palmer Station can accommodate is 46 people. The normal austral summer contingent varies, but it is generally around 40 people. Palmer is staffed year-round; however, the population drops to 15-20 people for winter maintenance after the conclusion of the summer research season. There are science labs located in the Bio-Lab building (pictured), the other main building is GWR (Garage, Warehouse and Recreaction). The facility is the second Palmer Station; \\"Old Palmer\\" was about a mile to the northwest adjacent to the site of the British Antarctic Survey \\"Base N\\",BAS Anvers IslandStation N built in the mid-fifties. The site is on what is now known as Amsler Island. Old Palmer was built about 1965, and served as a base for those building \\"new\\" Palmer, which opened in 1968. Old Palmer was designated as an emergency refuge for the new station in case of disaster, though this perceived need disappeared over time. It was dismantled and removed from the Antarctic as part of the National Science Foundation's environmental cleanup efforts in the early 1990s. Most of the station's personnel are seasonal employees of the U.S. Antarctic Program's main support contractor, Leidos.https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=189574 The summer support staff is usually 23 people. Previous main support contractors were Raytheon Polar Services, Holmes and Narver of Orange, California, ITT Antarctic Services of Paramus, New Jersey, and Antarctic Support Associates of Englewood, Colorado. Over time many support staff have worked for two or more of these firms.  Science  Palmer Station is located at 64.77¬∞S, 64.05¬∞W. The majority of the science research conducted at Palmer Station revolves around marine biology. The station also houses year-round monitoring equipment for global seismic, atmospheric, and UV-monitoring networks, as well as a site for the study of heliophysics. Palmer also hosts a radio receiver that studies lightning over the Western Hemisphere. Other research is conducted from the research vessel (R/V) Laurence M. Gould. Science cruises cover physical oceanography, marine geology, and marine biology. The ship also carries field parties to sites around the Antarctic Peninsula to study glaciology, geology, and paleontology. The USAP has a science planning summary for each year at Palmer Station.https://www.usap.gov/sciencesupport/?m=3  Climate  The K√∂ppen Climate Classification for Palmer Station is a tundra climate (ET). Due to its northern location and coastal location, the temperatures moderate more than interior climates. Winters are general cold and subzero, while summers are chilly, but regularly rise to temperatures above freezing. The average temperature for the year in Palmer Station is 28.8 ¬∞F (-1.8 ¬∞C). The warmest month, on average, is January. The coldest month is August.  Supply and transport  Palmer Station is re-supplied by the R/V Laurence M. Gould, a ship with an ice-strengthened hull that makes routine science research cruises around the peninsula. The R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer, the United States Antarctic Program's other research vessel, has also made port calls to Palmer Station ‚Äî Hero Inlet, where the pier is located, is too shallow for the Palmer to dock at the station, though. Both ships are staffed and leased to the USAP by Edison-Chouest Offshore. Hero Inlet is named for the R/V Hero, a 125-foot wooden trawler-type vessel built to conduct research and supply Palmer Station from ports in Argentina and Chile. The Hero was owned by the National Science Foundation and built in 1968 by the Harvey Gamage shipyard in Maine. Palmer Station is located on Gamage Point, named for the shipbuilder. Other people believe that Hero Inlet is named after Capt. Nathaniel Palmer's 47 foot sloop, Hero, that he was sailing when he first sighted Antarctica. After years of service, the Hero was retired in 1984 and replaced by the R/V Polar Duke, a larger and more modern ice-strengthened vessel under charter from Rieber Shipping, based in Bergen, Norway. The Duke was replaced by the R/V Laurence M. Gould in 1997. There is no routine air access to Palmer. Over the years, small ski-equipped aircraft have occasionally landed on the glacier to the east of the station. USAP participants travel aboard the Laurence M. Gould from Punta Arenas, Chile. The course follows the Straits of Magellan to the east, then south along the coast of Argentina, past Cape Horn, then directly south across the Drake Passage and on to Anvers Island. The entire journey usually takes four days; however, sea ice and storms can slow the journey down.  In popular culture  The 1981 Japanese film Fukkatsu no hi (Day of Resurrection/Virus) revolves around Palmer Station as the gathering place for humanity's last survivors of a deadly virus. The film stars George Kennedy as Admiral Conway, the station's commanding officer and features Glenn Ford as the President of the United States. Much of the footage for the film was shot in the vicinity of Palmer Station, though none was actually filmed at the station. Although the actual station can accommodate fewer than 50 people, the station depicted in the film housed several hundred.

He was also the longtime chairman of the board and president of the Folgers Coffee Company. He was the son of James Athearn Folger, Jr. (born c. 1864) and wife Clare Luning and paternal grandson of founder J. A. Folger, and the father of Abigail Folger, who was killed in the notorious Tate-Labianca murders in 1969 at the age of 25. Early life Born and raised in California to James Athern Folger Jr. and Clara Eugenia Luning, Folger studied business and graduated from Yale University where he was an athlete on their football, track and field, and polo teams. Peter Folger later served in World War II as a Marine Major. Business In 1963, after having helped to build the family firm into the third largest coffee wholesaler in the United States, Folger sold the company to Procter & Gamble for 1,650,000 shares of P&G; common stock. However, he and the Folger family continued to operate Folgers as a P&G; subsidiary. Personal life He married twice, first to In√©s Mej√≠a (June 25, 1907 ‚Äì July 15, 2007), the daughter of Encarnacion Mej√≠a, the consul general for El Salvador, and wife Gertrude Guirola, sister of Edwin Mej√≠a (born San Francisco, California, 26 April 1897), and member of a prestigious California land grant family hailing from San Salvador. They went on to have two children, Abigail Anne, born in San Francisco, California, on August 11, 1943 and Peter, Jr, born in 1945. In√©s filed for divorce which was granted in 1952. They shared joint custody of their two children. On June 30, 1960, Peter married his 24-year-old secretary Beverly Mater (born October 10, 1935). They had one daughter together, Elizabeth, in January 1961. Peter and Beverly lived with their daughter at the Folger mansion located in Woodside, California until 1974 when they moved to a newly built home on Roberta Drive. The murder of his eldest daughter, Abigail Anne, in Los Angeles, California, on August 9, 1969, was said to have lessened Peter's desire to continue living at the Woodside estate, where she grew up. After Abigail died, Peter conducted his own investigation into her death and spent the rest of his life protecting her from being the subject of salacious gossip, threatening legal action against anyone who tried to use her name in damning articles or books about the Tate murders. As a result, very little information is available about her. Death Folger died from prostate cancer at his home in Woodside, California, at the age of 74 on August 27, 1980, and was buried in the Folger family plot at Mountain View Cemetery, in Oakland, California. He was survived by his wife, Beverly (45 at the time of his death), who did not remarry.

The channel first launched on October 17, 1997, and operates two time-shifted feeds, running on Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules. History In September 1996, 1155636 Ontario Inc. (a company majority controlled by Baton Broadcasting, with the remaining interests held by Shaw Cable, Astral Broadcasting, and Les Films Rozon inc.) was granted a television broadcasting licence by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for The Comedy Network. The channel launched on October 17, 1997The Comedy Network turns 10 today and goes full-on-cyber with revolutionary revamped website as The Comedy Network with the slogan Time well wasted, a variation of the U.S.-based channel A&E;'s slogan at the time, Time well spent. Final Comedy logo, used from 2011 to 2019. Through various acquisitions over the years, Shaw, Astral and Les Films Rozon sold their interest in the service to Baton, which became Bell Globemedia in 2001, renamed CTVglobemedia in 2007, and renamed again as Bell Media in 2011, following its acquisition by Bell Canada. Until then, and since its incarnation in 1997, The Comedy Network maintained a consistent look - the \\"yellow oval\\" logo, which has undergone slight modifications throughout its use. On November 1, 2011, The Comedy Network was relaunched with a new look, consisting a new simplified logo and revamped on- air presentation. Their longtime slogan was also retired on this date.It‚Äôs a NEWvember for The Comedy Network as new look and feel revealed Nov. 1 Bell Media press release October 28, 2011 On July 12, 2012, The Comedy Network launched a high-definition simulcast feed available through all major TV providers. In August 2013, the CRTC denied an amendment to The Comedy Network's license, which would have reduced the amount of Canadian-produced content the network would have been required to air monthly, increase the amount of animated programming it could air from 10% of its lineup per day to 20% per month, and allow it to air films that were not Canadian-made. Bell argued that the network was at a disadvantage against BiteTV and Teletoon, because Comedy was unable to give its animated acquisitions a larger amount of exposure (such as marathons) due to the restriction. The CRTC rejected its arguments in response to complaints by the two networks cited and other unions, due to their differing natures of service and because Bell's proposed changes were intended primarily to decrease the amount of Canadian content it airs in favor of more U.S.-originated programming. Subsequently, a number of acquired Comedy Network programs were moved to its sister channel Much in the fall of 2013. On June 7, 2018, during the CTV upfronts, it was announced that The Comedy Network would eventually rebrand as \\"CTV Comedy\\", as part of a realignment of several Bell Media channels under the CTV name. On June 8, 2019, it was revealed The Comedy Network would relaunch as CTV Comedy Channel on September 12, 2019. Programming CTV Comedy Channel primarily airs sitcoms and stand-up comedy programming (including anthologies and specials), with much of the latter coming from the channel's association with the Montreal-based Just for Laughs comedy festival. The network also produces its own original programming, with several series (such as Puppets Who Kill, Odd Job Jack and Kevin Spencer) developing cult followings and loyal fan-bases. Puppets Who Kill, Comedy Now!, The Gavin Crawford Show, and several other Comedy original series have gone on to win Canadian Comedy Awards, including CTV's Corner Gas, which has also won six Gemini Award wins, seven Leo Award wins, and an International Emmy nomination. The network has historically had a relationship with ViacomCBS-owned Comedy Central in the U.S. In June 2007, Comedy's parent company (then known as CTVglobemedia) announced a deal for exclusive Canadian rights to the entire Comedy Central library of past and present programs on all electronic platforms, under a multi-year agreement with Viacom.CTV and Comedy Central deal for laughs; CTV strikes multi-platform content deal for laugh nets' program library CTVglobemedia press release June 27, 2007 For several years, Canadians attempting to visit Comedy Central websites were redirected to the Comedy Network's website.

Various aspects of a case that are not in controversy may be the \\"facts of the case\\" and are determined by the agreement of the separate parties; the trier of fact need not decide such issues. Juries In a jury trial, a jury is the trier of fact. The jury finds the facts and applies them to the relevant statute or law it is instructed by the judge to use in order to reach its verdict. Thus, in a jury trial, the findings of fact are made by the jury while the judge makes legal rulings as to what evidence will be heard by the jury and what legal framework governs the case. Jurors are instructed to strictly follow the law as given by the judge, but are in no way obligated to do so. In some cases this leads to jury nullification, where the jury's verdict differs from what the law states. In Anglo-American‚Äìbased legal systems, finding of fact made by the jury is not appealable unless clearly wrong to any reasonable person.

Vesicants have medical uses including wart removal but can be fatal if even small amounts are ingested. Blister agents used in warfare Most blister agents fall into one of three groups: * Sulfur mustards ‚Äì A family of sulfur- based agents, including mustard gas. * Nitrogen mustards ‚Äì A family of agents similar to the sulfur mustards, but based on nitrogen instead of sulfur. * Lewisite ‚Äì An early blister agent that was developed, but not used, during World War I. It was effectively rendered obsolete with the development of British anti-Lewisite in the 1940s. Occasionally, phosgene oxime is included among the blister agents, although it is more properly termed a nettle agent (urticant).  Effects  Exposure to a weaponized blister agent can cause a number of life-threatening symptoms, including: * Severe skin, eye and mucosal pain and irritation * Skin erythema with large fluid blisters that heal slowly and may become infected * Tearing, conjunctivitis, corneal damage * Mild respiratory distress to marked airway damage All blister agents currently known are denser than air, and are readily absorbed through the eyes, lungs, and skin. Effects of the two mustard agents are typically delayed: exposure to vapors becomes evident in 4 to 6 hours, and skin exposure in 2 to 48 hours. The effects of Lewisite are immediate.

Kirkland graduated from Princeton in 1765. In 1793 as part of his missionary work with the Oneida tribe he founded a seminary, the Hamilton-Oneida Academy in Clinton, New York. The seminary admitted both white and Oneida boys. Kirkland named it in honor of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, who was a member of the first Board of Trustees of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy. The Hamilton- Oneida Academy was chartered as Hamilton College in 1812 (Hamilton College). A student of the Iroquoian languages, Kirkland lived for many years with the Iroquois tribes. He helped negotiate the land purchases that New York State made from the Iroquois after the American Revolutionary War, acquiring his own land in the process. Early life and education Samuel Kirkland was born on December 1, 1741, in Norwich, Connecticut. He was educated in common schools and at Princeton (then the College of New Jersey), where he graduated in 1765. He was soon ordained as a Presbyterian minister and wanted to work with Native Americans. Career Kirkland began his missionary work as a prot√©g√© of Reverend Eleazar Wheelock in Connecticut at his Moor's Indian Charity School (later relocated to New Hampshire as Dartmouth College). Kirkland met Joseph Brant, a Mohawk who became a war leader against the rebels during the American Revolutionary War while at the school. Kirkland and Wheelock parted company in 1770. Kirkland moved to central New York, where he became a missionary to the Iroquois, especially the Oneida and Tuscarora located at the western end of the Mohawk River Valley. He acted as an adviser and ambassador to the Iroquois during the American Revolutionary War. At a time when four of the Six Nations allied with the British, he helped persuade the Oneida and Tuscarora to assist the American revolutionaries. Warfare in the Mohawk Valley caused widespread destruction in both the colonial frontier settlements and many Iroquois villages, as one side and another conducted retaliatory attacks. After the war, Kirkland maintained good relations with the Iroquois. In 1790 he was visited by the Italian explorer Paolo Andreani who reported on his observations of Kirkland and the Oneida people. Andreani noted that Kirkland had collected basic word lists of over 200 languages. He also saw how Kirkland conducted Sunday services with translated psalms. The participants were teased by other members of the tribe but the congregation was sincere and they abstained from hunting and other work on Sundays. Kirkland played a key role in organizing purchases of lands from the Oneida on behalf of New York state, in the process securing large parcels of the Oneida land for himself and his friends.Hauptman (2001), pp. 69‚Äì74. Kirkland's assistant James Dean was present at every land cession from the Oneida to the state of New York between 1785 and 1818.Hauptman (2001), p. 73 He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1790. Kirkland helped negotiate treaties and keep peace between the Iroquois tribes, who were relocated to smaller reservations, and whites. He is considered by many to be the peacekeeper between the Iroquois and the settlers after the war, when settlers did not sufficiently distinguish between former allies and those nations who had been enemies and responsible for destruction. In addition, the wave of migration from New England brought many Yankees eager to acquire land, and they encroached on the Iroquois both before and after land purchases by the state. Long interested in education, in 1793 Kirkland founded the Hamilton-Oneida Academy as a boys' school in central New York to meet demand from the many new European-American settlements. (This later developed as Hamilton College.) It was a time of the development of boys' schools throughout the state, followed in the nineteenth century by girls' schools. Marriage and family On September 20, 1769, Samuel Kirkland married Jerusha Bingham (1743‚Äì1788) in Windham, Connecticut. They had several children, who grew up to have leadership positions with their families and in society. Their son, John Thornton Kirkland (1770‚Äì1840) served as President of Harvard College from 1810 to 1828. Their eldest daughter, Jerusha Kirkland, (1776‚Äì1862) married John Hosmer Lothrop (1769‚Äì1829). The Kirklands' granddaughter Frances Eliza Lothrop (1809‚Äì1893) married John Hiram Lathrop (1799‚Äì1866). A graduate of Yale with a law degree, he became a teacher and, in 1840, the first President of the University of Missouri at Columbia. The couple were honored by a large memorial stained glass window in Grace and Holy Trinity Cathedral in Kansas City, Missouri, where descendants of both the Lathrops and the Kirklands are members of the Parish.

In 1972 he succeeded Sir Solomon Hochoy as Governor General. When Trinidad and Tobago became a republic in 1976, Clarke was unanimously elected the country's first President by the electoral college, which comprised the elected members of both Houses of Parliament. He was re-elected by the People's National Movement-controlled electoral college and completed his second term in 1987. Disagreements with the new National Alliance for Reconstruction government resulted in Clarke's decision not to seek a third term. He was succeeded by Noor Hassanali. Clarke was invested as a Companion of St Michael and St George by Queen Elizabeth II in 1960 and was awarded a knighthood as a Knight Grand Cross of that order in 1972. Although he ceased to use the title Sir after the country became a republic, after retirement from the presidency he re-adopted his title and was generally referred to as \\"Former President, Sir Ellis Clarke\\" or Sir Ellis. He was married to Lady Ermyntrude Clarke (1921‚Äì2002) for almost fifty years.Paul Donovan, \\"Obituary: Sir Ellis Clarke\\", Independent Catholic News, 1 February 2011.

Ellis Clarke was one of six experts worldwide asked to submit reports to Australia's Republic Advisory Committee in 1993 detailing his country's experience in moving from a constitutional monarchy to a republic. Death and funerals On 24 November 2010, Clarke suffered a massive stroke.Julian Neaves, \\"Sir Ellis Is Dead\\", Trinidad Express Newspapers, 31 December 2010. He died on 30 December 2010, two days after his 93rd birthday. Clarke was laid to rest on 7 January 2011. A private funeral was held at the Church of the Assumption on Maraval Road in Port of Spain. Both his living children as well as his four grandsons gave tributes. Following the private funeral, a state funeral was held at the National Academy for the Performing Arts Building situated at the Queens Park Savannah. It was an inter-religious celebration at which the President, Prime Minister and Chief Justice paid tributes. In attendance were members of Parliament, senators, members of the diplomatic corps, and foreign heads of state and dignitaries. A procession through Port of Spain followed the service. Sir Ellis' coffin, draped in a Trinidad and Tobago flag, was set atop a cannon and pulled by a military vehicle. The procession concluded at Laperouse Cemetery, where he was buried at the Clarke family plot, which burial was attended by family and friends.

Each arm of the cruciform contains two apartments.Architectural Studies of Air Flow at Amoy Gardens, Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong, and its Possible Relevance to the Spread of SARS. Status report, 2 May 2003 There is a shopping arcade (Amoy Plaza) as well as a food square within the Amoy Gardens estate. History=Development= The site was purchased by Amoy Canning in the 1920s for use as a factory. Amoy put the site of approximately up for auction in March 1977, intending to move their manufacturing operations elsewhere in stages. The auction failed as the reserve price was not reached. Subsequently, Hang Lung Development signed an agreement to purchase the site in April 1977 for about HK$200 million. Under the agreement, Amoy would take a share of the profits from the site's redevelopment. The estate was built in four phases. The construction contract for the estate's first phase, comprising seven residential blocks (blocks A-G) and retail space, was awarded to Hong Kong contractor Shui On Construction on 18 October 1979. The first phase was completed in 1981, while the final phase was completed in 1987. =SARS outbreak= Toward the end of March 2003, an outbreak of SARS occurred among residents of Amoy Gardens. By April 15, 2003, there had been a total of 321 cases of SARS in the estate. A concentration of cases was recorded in block E, accounting for 41% of the cumulative total. Block C (15%), block B (13%) and block D (13%) recorded the second, third and fourth highest incidence of SARS infections. The other cases (18%) were scattered in 11 other blocks.Outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) at Amoy Gardens, Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong Main Findings of the Investigation. 17 April 2003 Most of the initial 107 patients from Block E lived in flats that were vertically arranged. All residents were subsequently moved to Lei Yue Mun and Lady MacLehose Holiday Village for isolation. In mid-2003, authorities found that the design of bathroom floor drains lacked a replenishment system to keep the water traps filled, allowing virus-laden aerosols to seep into bathrooms, exacerbated by the draw of bathroom exhaust fans. These were among the factors that contributed to the rapid spread of SARS in that complex. The estate was decontaminated and the residents were able to return. Later, the complex was retrofitted with an auxiliary floor drainage system that included fresh water interlocks to prevent regurgitation of sewer gases. Demographics According to the 2016 by-census, Amoy Gardens had a population of 10,721. The median age was 37.7 and the majority of residents (95.6 per cent) were of Chinese ethnicity. The average household comprised 2.4 persons. The median monthly household income of all households was HK$34,000.

It was created by Alan Moore and Alan Davis for the British weekly comics anthology 2000 AD. It first appeared in 1983. The strip was the tale of how two alien teenage students Waldo \\"D.R.\\" (for \\"Diminished Responsibility\\") Dobbs, a scheming criminal mastermind, and Ernest Errol Quinch, his muscular purple- skinned companion in crime, have influenced Earth's history in various anarchic ways. Publication history=Creation and concept= D.R. and Quinch began in 2000 AD as a one-off comic in the Time Twisters series titled ‚ÄúD.R. and Quinch Have Fun On Earth‚Äù. The characters were initially meant to only appear once but they proved so popular that they were given their own semi-regular series. D.R. and Quinch were inspired by the National Lampoon characters O.C. and Stiggs. The film Animal House has also been cited as an influence. Alan Davis took visual inspiration from the cartoon style of Leo Baxendale‚Äôs Grimly Feendish. Alan Moore has described D.R. & Quinch as belonging to the tradition of British teenage delinquency comics, comparable to Dennis the Menace except with ‚Äúa thermonuclear capacity‚Äù. = Later appearances = The pair's last storyline, \\"D.R. and Quinch Go to Hollywood,\\" ran from progs 363 to 367 and is considered to be Moore and Davis's finest D.R. and Quinch story. However, at the time, the Moore/Davis partnership was undergoing strain due to Moore refusing permission for their Captain Britain work to be reprinted. The pair's last D.R. and Quinch work together was in the 2000 AD Sci-Fi Special in 1985. D.R. and Quinch continued to appear in 2000 AD from progs 525 to 534 in the form of an advice column with readers sending in letters with personal problems solved by D.R. and Quinch in their own way. One such column was \\"hijacked\\" by D.R.'s girlfriend Crazy Chrissy. These later episodes were written by Jamie Delano. In 1986 Titan Books released a collection of all D.R. and Quinch stories from 2000 AD called D.R. and Quinch's Totally Awesome Guide To Life. It became one of Titan's best selling books in their lines of 2000 AD reprints. The book went out of print several times and it has since been collected as The Complete D.R. and Quinch () in 2001. In 2018, INDIO comics released a story, \\"D.R. & Quinch Hijack Free Comic Book Day\\", which was part of a \\"2000 AD Regened\\" all-ages comic created for Free Comic Book Day.

Writing for Time, Douglas Wolk described it as, for the majority of its run, \\"one of the funniest comics ever\\" and Neil Gaiman has credited it with being one of the greatest 2000 AD stories.

The school has an enrollment of 7,534 students in 2019 and 266 full-time faculty members. MSUM is a part of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system. MSUM is located on the western border of Minnesota on the Red River of the North in Moorhead; across the river lies Fargo, North Dakota. History The plans for what would become MSUM were laid down in 1885, when the Minnesota State Legislature passed a bill declaring the need for a new state normal school in the Red River Valley, with an eye on Moorhead. The State Senator who proposed the bill, State Senator Solomon Comstock, donated and appropriated the funds that would go to form Moorhead Normal School, which opened in 1888. In 1921, the State authorized the school to offer the four- year Bachelor of Science degree in Education in order to satisfy the need for high school teachers in northwest Minnesota, and the school became Moorhead State Teachers College. With the entrance of World War II, the college entered into a contract with the Army Air Corps to train aviation students. After World War II, enrollment swelled to more than 700 students and the school diversified and broadened into both a liberal arts and professional curriculum. The school began offering a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1946 and graduate programs by 1953. As a result of the broadened offerings, by 1957 the name was changed to Moorhead State College. Weld Hall, the oldest building on campus. In 1969, the school joined a cooperative cross-registration exchange with neighboring Concordia College and North Dakota State University, creating the Tri-College University. The school continued to increase its number of programs and by 1975, the State Legislature that year granted the school university status under the name Moorhead State University. In 1995, Moorhead State became part of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system. On July 1, 2000, the school was renamed Minnesota State University Moorhead via a request sent to the Board of Trustees of the system. Minnesota State University Moorhead was rated the 18th top liberal arts college in the midwest by TIME magazine in 2008. The school has gone through many names changes with Moorhead Normal School (1887), Moorhead State Teachers College (1921), Moorhead State College (1957), Moorhead State University (1975) and finally Minnesota State University Moorhead (2000). =Presidents= Lommen Hall, home to Elementary & Early Childhood Education, the Secondary Education, and the Special Education departments. * 1888‚Äì1899 Livingston C.

The conference was first offered in 1998.\\"Student Academic Conference: History.\\" Minnesota State University Moorhead. 2011-04-19. The conference provides a formal setting for upper class students to present their research from classes required under their major. There is a possibility of the student's research being published or presented at a state, regional, or national conference. The Student Academic Conference is a great opportunity for students and MSUM to gain recognition on a larger scale. Any major or discipline can present at the conference as long as it abides by conference rules based on which forum the student chooses to present the research. There is an option to orally present using visual aids, Powerpoint, etc..., or the student can construct a poster board displaying key points and results to be presented in a more informal manner taking questions and inquiries from onlookers. The conference is kicked off by a luncheon for all the participants. For some majors, presenting at the conference is mandatory in which the student presents their discipline's research from their senior seminar or thesis class.

It is part of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System. The university has an enrollment of approximately 8,700 students and employs 148 faculty members. It is divided into two major colleges, the College of Arts, Letters, and Sciences and the College of Business, Education, and Professional Studies. SMSU is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.  History  The university was founded in 1964 as Southwest Minnesota State College (SMSC). It admitted its first class of students on September 19, 1967. The college became Southwest State University (SSU) on August 1, 1975, and kept that name for nearly thirty years until adopting the name Southwest Minnesota State University (SMSU) on July 1, 2003.Name changes approved for Southwest State University and Anoka-Hennepin Technical College , Retrieved September 12, 2016 The student newspaper, originally called The Impact, was first published May 10, 1968. The name was changed to The Reader in 1974, and then back to The Impact in 1980. In 2003 the name was changed to The Spur to be more consistent with the Mustang theme and to spur students into action. The R/A (Recreation/Athletic) Facility was built in 1996 and is a 4,000-seat multi-purpose venue. New SMSU Student Center, completed in 2005 On January 2, 2002, a fire destroyed the Student Center, which originally featured an underground living area and a glass dome. The dome's concrete framework was incorporated into the new student and conference center and is still visible in the food court area. The new center was completed in 2005. It features a replica of the original dome with the words \\"Student Center Dome: 1972‚Äì2002\\" written on it at the Alumni Heritage Center, near the Mustang Zone in the upper level.

The athletic field was named Mattke Field after the old field, and in honor of past athletic director Glenn Mattke. The center is used by the Mustang football and soccer teams, as well as teams from Marshall High School, and for other regional activities, such as concerts. It took two years and $16 million to complete.Bruns, S. (September 10, 2008). Grand opening of the $16 million regional event center goes well. The Spur, Volume 6, Issue 1, Page 1.  Academics  Southwest Minnesota State University provides undergraduate education in the liberal arts and professional studies. The most popular undergraduate majors are business administration and education. It also has specialized graduate programs in education, special education, and business administration. The MBA program has degree options in marketing, leadership, and the general MBA. Students can take classes both onsite and online. The graduate school does not have a student senate, but there is an MBA student organization. A critical element of the undergraduate and graduate business programs' success is the Southwest Marketing Advisory Center, where students can do research on actual businesses. Play by Samuel Beckett In addition to being regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, SMSU's programs are also accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music, the Minnesota Board of Teaching, the American Chemical Society and the Council on Social Work Education.  Campus  Most of the SMSU campus was constructed between 1965 and 1973 according to a unified plan. The brick and concrete buildings are interconnected via tunnels and enclosed walkways, providing a continuous and controlled environment during both summer and winter. The residence halls are not connected. There are many courtyards with gardens between the buildings. The campus is virtually barrier-free, allowing easy access to students in wheelchairs. The university's residence halls were named by the students during the late 1960s and reflect various themes and values of the times, e.g. Aquarius, Casa Futura, Methedras and Kama Sutra. Armstrong Hall was named after astronaut Neil Armstrong in honor of his trip to the moon in 1969. Manchester Hall was named for pop singer Melissa Manchester after a concert she gave on campus. In 2009 the university opened a new dorm named Sweetland Hall in honor of a late president, Douglas Sweetland. Residence Halls: * Traditional Halls ‚Äì Six complexes of four connected halls that were built in the 1960s and feature a common bathroom for the whole floor. * Sweetland Hall ‚Äì A new complex with around 250 beds with a bathroom shared by suit-mates (two to four people). * Foundation Apartments ‚Äì Apartment style residence hall with laundry and kitchen appliances in each apartment. There are no fraternities or sororities on campus in order to promote a safe and friendly environment for all students. Organizations: The Southwest Marketing Advisory Center (SMAC) is located on the second floor of the Science and Technology building, Room 203. SMAC is a self-funded entity within the academic marketing program at Southwest State. Its mission is to serve the marketing and research needs of southwestern Minnesota while giving real-world experience to junior, senior and graduate-level student employees. Each student attending Southwest Minnesota State University pays a .43 cent per credit fee to fund the Minnesota State University Student Association, a student-led nonprofit organization that advocates on behalf of all students.

Most of his performances were rooted in jazz, but he was also active in free improvisation and occasionally contributed to rock music recordings. Wheeler wrote over one hundred compositions and was a skilled arranger for small groups and large ensembles. Wheeler was the patron of the Royal Academy Junior Jazz course. Early life Wheeler was born in Toronto, Ontario, on 14 January 1930. Growing up in Toronto, he began playing the cornet at age 12 and became interested in jazz in his mid-teens. Wheeler spent a year studying composition at The Royal Conservatory of Music in 1950. In 1952 he moved to Britain. He found his way into the London jazz scene of the time, playing in groups led by Tommy Whittle, Tubby Hayes, and Ronnie Scott. Career In the late 1950s, he was a member of Buddy Featherstonhaugh's quintet together with Bobby Wellins. Throughout the sixties, he worked with John Dankworth, and also formed part of (Eric Burdon and) the Animals' Big Band that made its only public appearance at the 5th Annual British Jazz & Blues Festival in Richmond (1965) with tenors Stan Robinson, Dick Morrissey and Al Gay, baritone sax Paul Carroll, and fellow trumpets Ian Carr and Greg Brown. In 1968, Wheeler appeared on guitarist Terry Smith's first solo album, Fall Out. Kenny Wheeler performing with the United Jazz + Rock Ensemble, 1992 Wheeler performed and recorded his own compositions with large jazz ensembles throughout his career, beginning with the first album under his own name, Windmill Tilter (1969), recorded with the John Dankworth band. BGO Records released a CD in September 2010. The big band album Song for Someone (1973) fused Wheeler's characteristic orchestral writing with passages of free improvisation provided by musicians such as Evan Parker and Derek Bailey, and was also named Album of the Year by Melody Maker magazine in 1975. It has subsequently been reissued on CD by Parker's Psi label. In the mid-1960s, Wheeler became a close participant in the nascent free improvisation movement in London, playing with Parker, John Stevens, the Spontaneous Music Ensemble and the Globe Unity Orchestra. Despite the above-noted accomplishments, much of his reputation rests on his work with smaller jazz groups. Wheeler's first small group recordings to gain significant critical attention were Gnu High (1975) and Deer Wan (1977), both for the ECM label (Gnu High is one of the few albums to feature Keith Jarrett as a sideman since his tenure with Charles Lloyd). One exception from the ongoing collaboration with ECM was his rare album on CBC called Ensemble Fusionaire in 1976. This had three other Canadian musicians and was recorded in St. Mary's Church in Toronto for a different character to the sound than on the ECM recordings.On Wheeler's career to the late 1970s see Roger Cotterrell,‚ÄòKenny Wheeler: Speaking Softly but Carrying a Big Horn‚Äô Jazz Forum 57 (Jan 1979), 38-41. Wheeler was the trumpeter in the Anthony Braxton Quartet from 1971 to 1976. He was also a member of the chamber jazz trio Azimuth with John Taylor and Norma Winstone from 1977 to 2000. Their first release under this name was a 1977 album issued by ECM; two albums followed, with later albums coming in 1985 and 1995. Later life In 1997 Wheeler received widespread critical praise for his album Angel Song, which featured an unusual \\"drummerless\\" quartet of Bill Frisell (guitar), Dave Holland (bass) and Lee Konitz (alto sax). Wheeler recorded seven albums with CAM Jazz from 2005 to 2008 but returned to ECM to record his final album in 2013. Wheeler died after a short period of frail health at a nursing home in London on 18 September 2014. He was 84 years old.

Launched on 15 December 1974, it is Australia's first fully licensed FM radio station. The station broadcasts from studios located at Chandos Street, St Leonards, to the greater Sydney region at a frequency of 102.5 MHz from a 50 kilowatt (ERP) transmitter located atop Governor Phillip Tower, in Sydney's central business district. Its operations are conducted by volunteers and a small number of paid staff. Operational funding is principally derived from corporate sponsorship, arts partnerships, philanthropic donations, listener subscriptions, and the secondhand Book and CD Fairs held around the Sydney area. Approximately 80 percent of Fine Music Sydney's on-air music content is from the western classical and related traditions, and the remainder is made up of jazz, blues, and non-mainstream and experimental contemporary music. One of the station's most popular programmes for several decades was Evensong, a weekly programme of English sacred music in the Anglican tradition. Its regular presenter Mrs. Ann Ramsay died at the age of 91 on 1 April 2006, prior to which she was thought to be Australia's oldest on-air radio presenter.

Winona State University was founded as Winona Normal School in 1858 and is the oldest member of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System. It was the first normal school west of the Mississippi River. WSU offers more than 80 programs on its main campus, as well as collegiate programs on satellite campuses at Winona State University-Rochester and the Winona West Campus. It has average annual enrollment of approximately nine thousand enrolled undergraduate and graduate students. Its sports teams compete as the Winona State Warriors in the NCAA Division II athletics in 14 sports, primarily in the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference. History Winona State University was founded as the First State Normal School, an institution specifically for educating and producing new elementary school teachers. In the 1850s Minnesota was on the American frontier and lacked trained teachers. Winona settler Dr. John Ford lobbied the Minnesota Legislature to establish normal schools and rallied more than $5,000 in local donations to establish the state's first such institution. It was also the first tax-funded school west of the Mississippi River. Classes at the Winona Normal School began in September 1860, but the following year most of the male students as well as the principal and other staff left to serve in the American Civil War. The school closed in March 1862 due to the Civil War, then for another two years due to the Sioux War of 1862. Its first class graduated in 1866. The program soon added a laboratory school in which local children received education from faculty while students observed or, occasionally, led lessons themselves. The normal school quickly outgrew its original four-room building, but state funding and local donations of money and a plot of land led to the construction of a proper facility in 1869. The campus expanded with two new wings on \\"Old Main\\" in 1894, a library/gymnasium/kindergarten building‚ÄîOgden Hall‚Äîin 1909, and a women's dormitory‚ÄîMorey Hall‚Äîin 1910. In 1915 a new building was constructed to house the laboratory school, and a second women's dormitory‚ÄîShepard Hall‚Äîappeared in 1920. The Winona State Normal School became Winona Teachers College in 1921 and was authorized to grant a four-year Bachelor of Education degree. In December 1922 a fire broke out in Old Main and completely destroyed it, though no one was harmed as it was the middle of a term break. Local public buildings and churches offered space for classes and administrative business until a new main building, College Hall, could be constructed in 1924. The 1915 Model School Building, now Phelps Hall, and the 1924 College Hall, now Somsen Hall, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013 for having local significance in education. They were nominated as examples of the normal school movement, which helped shape public education in Minnesota. The Winona Normal School was Minnesota's first teacher training school and first laboratory school, and operated 1860‚Äì1971. =Name changes= Architectural sculpture above an entrance to Somsen Hall. * First State Normal School of Minnesota (1858) * Winona Normal School (1873) * Winona State Teachers' College (1921) * Winona State College (1957) * Winona State University (1975) The Winona State University library, named for former university president Darrell Krueger. Academics The WSU main campus and its surroundings in Winona, Minnesota Winona State University offers 65 undergraduate programs and 12 graduate programs. It was one of the earliest universities in the country to offer a \\"Laptop University\\" program, now known as the e-Warrior Digital Life and Learning Program. In this program each student, upon acceptance, is required to lease his or her choice of either an Apple Macintosh or Microsoft Windows based laptop directly from the university. In 2013 WSU became the first public university in the Midwest to offer a tablet and a laptop to all students. The purpose of this program is to increase the bond between education and technology. Each student attending Winona State University pays a .43 cent per credit fee to fund the Minnesota State University Student Association, a student-led non-profit that advocates on behalf of all Minnesota state university students. =International education= The International Services Office is the initial contact for all international students. Winona State University provides scholarship opportunities for International Students. Winona State University has established many sister school relations with colleges and universities around the world, including Tamkang University in Taiwan, Hebei University of Technology in Mainland China, Akita University, Tokyo International University, Toyo University in Japan, Soonchunhyang University, Chung-Ang University in South Korea, and universities in Malaysia, Mexico, Spain, Egypt, Hong Kong, Australia, etc. Winona State Facilities=Housing= Winona State University uses sixteen buildings as on-campus living communities. Nine buildings are on the main campus of Winona State, three are on West Campus, and four are built east of campus. Kirkland Hall and Haake Hall Originally named as New Hall East and New Center West, Kirkland Hall/Haake Hall opened in 2010 and consists of two buildings adjacent and also mirror images of each other. There are 106 units in this co-ed complex however, each unit is single-gendered. Prentiss-Lucas Hall Prentiss-Lucas Hall (commonly referred to as P-L) as it's called at Winona State, is one of the six freshmen residence halls. The two sides of the hall are mirror-image duplicates of each other (Prentiss is the men's residence side and Lucas is the women's), linked by a common lobby and lower level. This hall has been closed down after the spring semester of 2019. The students were sad to see it go. The Quad The Quad has four residence halls that form a square: Conway Hall, Richards Hall, Morey and Shepard Halls. The Quad contains multiple lounges, typically located where the four residence halls intersect each other. It houses over 500 students, most of whom are freshmen. Conway Hall is a four-story building that houses all females. 'Morey and Shepard Halls are connected in an \\"L\\" shape. Morey-Shepard consists of men and women divided by floor. Richards Hall is a four-story residence hall. Richards is also co-ed, the first and third floor, excluding the Richards Annex, house Men and the second and fourth being women. Morey Hall is the oldest on campus, being completed in 1911. Sheehan Hall Sheehan Hall was completed for Winona State College as a fourteen-story women-only hall in 1969. It is now co-ed residence hall, and houses the majority freshmen. The second through thirteenth floors are residential and the first floor is a lobby and social area including a full kitichen. Residential College The 'Residential College, also called West Campus, is situated on the former campus of the College of Saint Teresa, a defunct Roman Catholic women's college. =Lourdes Hall= Lourdes Hall was acquired by Winona State in the early 1990s.

Biography Oxley was born in Sheffield, England. A self-taught pianist by the age of eight, he first began playing the drums at seventeen. In Sheffield he was taught by Haydon Cook, who had returned to the city after a long residency in the 1950s at Ronnie Scott's in London. While in the Black Watch military band from 1957 to 1960, he studied music theory and improved his drumming technique. From 1960 to 1964 he led a quartet which performed locally in England. In 1963 he began working with Gavin Bryars and guitarist Derek Bailey in a trio known as Joseph Holbrooke. Oxley moved to London in 1966 and became house drummer at Ronnie Scott's, where he accompanied visiting musicians such as Joe Henderson, Lee Konitz, Charlie Mariano, Stan Getz, Sonny Rollins, and Bill Evans until the early 1970s. He was a member of bands led by Gordon Beck, Alan Skidmore, and Mike Pyne. In 1969 Oxley appeared on the John McLaughlin album Extrapolation and formed a quintet with Bailey, Jeff Clyne, Evan Parker, and Kenny Wheeler, releasing the album The Baptised Traveller. Following this album the group was joined by Paul Rutherford on trombone and became a sextet, releasing the 1970 album 4 Compositions for Sextet. That same year Oxley helped found Incus Records with Bailey and others and Musicians Cooperative. He received a three-month artist- in-residence job at the Sydney Conservatorium in Australia in 1970. Around this time he joined the London Jazz Composers Orchestra and collaborated with Howard Riley. In 1973 he became a tutor at the Jazz Summer School in Barry, South Wales, and in 1974 he formed the band Angular Apron. Through the 1980s he worked with Tony Coe and Didier Levallet and started the Celebration Orchestra during the latter half of the decade. Oxley toured with Anthony Braxton in 1989 began a working relationship with Cecil Taylor. In 1993 he joined a quartet with Tomasz Sta≈Ñko, Bobo Stenson, and Anders Jormin. In 2000 he released the album Triangular Screen with the Tony Oxley Project 1, a trio with Ivar Grydeland and Tonny Kluften.

On 23 August 1983, it was discovered by and later named after IRAS, a spaceborne all-sky infrared survey satellite.  Classification and orbit  The S-type asteroid is also classified as a CX-type by Pan-STARRS large-scale survey. It orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.1‚Äì3.2 AU once every 4 years and 4 months (1,576 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.21 and an inclination of 23¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The first used precovery was taken at Palomar Observatory in 1950, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 33 years prior to its discovery.  Rotation period  In August 2008, a photometric lightcurve analysis by U.S. astronomer Brian Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (), Colorado, gave a well-defined rotation period of hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.21 in magnitude ().  Diameter estimates  According to 12 observations by the discovering Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS, the asteroid has an albedo of 0.12 and a diameter of 19.6 kilometers. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives similar figures, as do the space-based surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. Two publications from the post-cryogenic NEOWISE mission find a larger diameter of 23.4 and 27.5 kilometers, respectively.  Naming  This minor planet was named for the discovering Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), a collaboration between the United States (NASA), the Netherlands (NIVR), and the United Kingdom (SERC), which observed more than 250,000 celestial bodies in the infrared at wavelengths between 12 and 100 ¬µm during 10 months in 1983. IRAS has also discovered two other minor planets, the 11-kilometer sized main- belt asteroid and 3200 Phaethon, a near-Earth and potentially hazardous object, parent body of the Geminid meteor shower, as well as six comets, such as 126P/IRAS, a short-period Jupiter family comet, which was also named after the discovering space observatory. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 4 May 1999 ().  References  External links   Lightcurve plot of 3728 IRAS, Palmer Divide Observatory, B. D.

Lamar has been a member of the Texas State University System since 1995. It was the flagship institution of the former Lamar University System. As of the fall of 2019, the university enrollment was 15,460 students. Lamar University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The university is named for Mirabeau B. Lamar, the second president of the Republic of Texas. History Louis R. Pietzsch founded a public junior college in Beaumont's South Park. Lamar University started on September 17, 1923 as South Park Junior College, operating on the unused third floor of the new South Park High School. Pietzsch acted as the first president of the college. South Park Junior College became the first college in Texas to receive Texas Department of Education approval during the first year of operation, and became fully accredited in 1925. In 1932, the college administration, recognizing that the junior college was serving the region rather than just the community, renamed it as Lamar College. It was named for Mirabeau B. Lamar, the second president of the Republic of Texas, who arranged to set aside land in counties for public schools. A statue of him was installed in the quadrangle of the campus near the Setzer Student Center. In 1933, the college was moving toward independence from South Park High School when construction began on new facilities. By 1942, the college was completely independent of the South Park school district, and operations moved to the current campus. With the end of World War II, an influx of veterans boosted enrollment. The Lamar board of trustees asked the Texas Legislature to promote Lamar College to a four-year state college. The initial attempt in 1947, led in the Texas House of Representatives by Jack Brooks and in the Texas Senate by W. R. Cousins, Jr., failed, but the following year the two sponsors again advanced the bill through both houses. On June 14, 1949, Governor Beauford Jester signed the bill creating Lamar State College of Technology. Rep. Jack Brooks is at far left. Governor Beauford Jester is seated. Sen W. R. Cousins, Jr is at far right. Austin, Texas. Enrollment continued to grow throughout the 1950s and 1960s, reaching 10,000 students. Graduate work was authorized in 1960, when master's degrees were offered in several fields. In 1969, Lamar State College opened its first branch at a center in Orange, Texas. In 1970, Lamar State College began offering its first doctoral program, the Doctor of Engineering. In 1971 the college's name was officially changed to Lamar University. A group of African American veterans of World War II, barred from admission on the grounds of race and calling themselves the Negro Goodwill Council, protested to Governor Beauford Jester about the exclusion of blacks from Lamar State College. They attempted to block passage of the bill to change Lamar into a state-supported senior college, which resulted in John Gray, Lamar's president, creating a black branch of Lamar called Jefferson Junior College. It opened with evening classes at Charlton-Pollard High School. In 1952, James Briscoe, a graduate of Charlton-Pollard High School, applied to Lamar. His parents were laborers and members of the Beaumont chapter of the NAACP. The admissions office notified him that on the basis of his transcript, he was qualified to enroll for the spring term of 1951. On January 29, when Briscoe went to register for classes, Lamar's acting president G. A. Wimberly explained that a mistake had been made and suggested he apply to TSUN, now named Texas Southern University. State law, he said, created Lamar for whites only. In the summer of 1955, Versie Jackson and Henry Cooper, Jr. became the lead plaintiffs of a class action lawsuit, Jackson v. McDonald, which sought to end Lamar's policy of racial segregation. Lamar Cecil, federal judge, ruled on July 30, 1956, that Lamar's ‚Äúwhite youth‚Äù only admissions policy was unconstitutional and that September, a total of twenty- six blacks were admitted to the college amid violent protests at the campus gates and throughout the region for a number of weeks until Texas Rangers arrived and the rule of law restored.Shabazz, Amilcar; Advancing Democracy: African Americans and the Struggle for Access and Equity in Higher Education in Texas, University of North Carolina Press, 2004, pp. 169‚Äì180, = Recent history = In 1975, the university merged with Port Arthur College in Port Arthur, Texas, creating Lamar University-Port Arthur. In 1983, state Senator Carl A. Parker sponsored a bill creating the Lamar University System. In 1986, Lamar University-Orange and Lamar University-Port Arthur were granted accreditation separate from the main campus. Lamar Institute of Technology was created in 1990 in Beaumont to provide technical, business, health, and industrial education through programs two years or fewer in length. In 1995, the Lamar University System was incorporated into the Texas State University System. In the fall of 1998 the Lamar University faculty numbered 423 and student enrollment was 8,241. Total enrollment reached 15,000 students in Fall 2012. In the late 1990s, Lamar began undertaking campus improvement projects. In 2001, the University began replacing its 1960s-vintage residence halls with new apartment-style housing facilities, dubbed \\"Cardinal Village.\\" In March 2005, the gym underwent extensive renovation and adjacent to it, a new recreational sports center was built. The $19 million center, named the Sheila Umphrey Recreational Sports Center, opened in April 2007. In August 2007, the University completed construction on Cardinal Village IV, a $16-million expansion of its residence halls. The University completed construction of Cardinal Village Phase V in August 2010 bringing on-campus housing capacity to 2,500 students. The University, in anticipation of the return of football program in 2010, renovated and upgraded Provost Umphrey Stadium (formerly Cardinal Stadium) and a new state-of-the-art Dauphin Athletic Complex. In October 2014, Lamar broke ground for an administration building to be named the Wayne A. Reaud Building. The building houses the newly established Reaud Honors College.

The boomtown that sprung up around the well was known as Gladys City. 100,000 barrels of oil were soon produced per day, making it the most productive in the world at that time. This productivity sparked an oil boom in Texas that continues to this day. Athletics The \\"Lamar Cardinals\\" (or \\"Cards\\") refers to the collegiate athletic teams of Lamar University. The inception of the nickname \\"Cardinals\\" dates back to the school's name change to Lamar in 1932. The teams compete in NCAA Division I athletics for all of its varsity sports. Lamar has participated in practically every level of collegiate athletics from its inception as a junior college in 1923 to its gaining university status in 1971. Lamar fields teams in each of the seventeen sports the Southland Conference sponsors. Lamar sponsors fifteen teams (seven men's and eight women's) that compete in the NCAA's Southland Conference for those seventeen sports. The newest teams are the reinstated football team beginning in 2010, and women's softball which began play in the 2013 season. With the addition of softball, Lamar is the only Southland Conference program to sponsor all men's and women's sports. The Cardinals participate in men's and women's basketball, golf, indoor and outdoor track and field, cross country, tennis, women's soccer, softball and volleyball, and men's baseball and football. =Football= Under former head coach Larry Kennan, Cardinal fans responded when he delivered a 6-3-2 club in 1979, his first season with the team. Lamar set all-time attendance records under Kennan by averaging 16,380 in 1980. Games against Louisiana Tech (17,600) and West Texas State (17,250) rank second and third, respectively, behind the standing-room-only 18,500 Baylor drew for the 1980 opener. The football program's signature win came on September 5, 1981 in Waco; the Cardinals triumphed with an 18‚Äì17 win over the UPI #20 ranked Baylor Bears. In 1987 Lamar football went independent to join the American South Conference, and the program was dropped altogether in 1989. Montagne Center and Provost Umphrey Stadium On January 30, 2008, 78% of Lamar students voted to approve the athletics fee required for football's resurrection. This vote set in motion the football team's return for the 2010 season. Regents of The Texas State University System approved the athletics fee to reinstate football at its regular meeting February 20, 2008. On May 19, 2008, Ray Woodard was chosen as head coach for the football program. Thanks to a major gift from an anonymous donor, the football field now bears the name W.S. ‚ÄúBud‚Äù Leonard Field, named for a former player and longtime Lamar advocate and regent. The Lamar University Cardinals football team returned to the gridiron after a 21-year hiatus, on September 4, 2010. The first-year squad compiled a respectable 5‚Äì6 record. The Cardinals opened Southland Conference play in 2011. The return of football to Lamar University is in part due to a generous donation from Beaumont-based law firm Provost Umphrey. To help renovate the stadium, Walter Umphrey and his wife Sheila also made a personal donation. The stadium is now named Provost Umphrey Stadium. In December 2016, Mike Schultz was named the program's second head coach since its return. After recording just one winning record in its first nine seasons since being brought back, Schultz guided the Cardinals to a 7‚Äì5 record and a third-place finish in the Southland Conference in just his second season. After a 1‚Äì4 start to the year, LU closed the regular season by rattling off six-straight wins to earn the program's first berth in the NCAA FCS Playoffs where it faced Northern Iowa. =Basketball= Founded in 1924, the men's and women's basketball teams at Lamar have both advanced deep into the NCAA tournament. The men's team has four NIT appearances, six NCAA tournament appearances, four second round appearances, and one sweet 16 appearance. The women's team has four WNIT appearance, two NCAA tournament appearances, and one Elite Eight appearance. The men's program has been coached by fourteen head coaches including Billy Tubbs, Pat Foster, Pat Knight and Tic Price, the current head coach. The women's team has been coached by thirteen head coaches including current head coach, Aqua Franklin. Over the years, both the men's and women's programs have had the highest average attendance in the Southland Conference. Both play in the 10,080-seat Montagne Center. =Baseball= The Lamar Cardinals baseball team represents Lamar University and competes in the Southland Conference, and is an NCAA Division I program. Current head coach Will Davis was hired from LSU in January 2016 to replace legendary coach Jim Gilligan. A former player, Gilligan guided the program for all but five seasons (1987‚Äì91) from 1973 through 2016. The LU Hall of Honor and Texas Baseball Hall of Fame member won more than 1,300 games during his career. The Cardinals baseball teams lead the Southland Conference with 10 regular season titles and has participated in the NCAA Division I Regionals 13 times. =Softball=Student life=Student demographics= In fall 2018, Lamar enrolled almost 15,000 students.

(left) The inside of a similar tube, showing the reservoir that holds the material that is evaporated to create the getter coating. During manufacture, after the tube is evacuated and sealed, an induction heater evaporates the material, which condenses on the glass. A getter is a deposit of reactive material that is placed inside a vacuum system, for the purpose of completing and maintaining the vacuum. When gas molecules strike the getter material, they combine with it chemically or by absorption. Thus the getter removes small amounts of gas from the evacuated space. The getter is usually a coating applied to a surface within the evacuated chamber. A vacuum is initially created by connecting a closed container to a vacuum pump. After achieving a vacuum, the container can be sealed, or the vacuum pump can be left running. Getters are especially important in sealed systems, such as vacuum tubes, including cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and vacuum insulated panels, which must maintain a vacuum for a long time. This is because the inner surfaces of the container release absorbed gases for a long time after the vacuum is established. The getter continually removes this residual gas as it is produced. Even in systems which are continually evacuated by a vacuum pump, getters are also used to remove residual gas, often to achieve a higher vacuum than the pump could achieve alone. Although it weighs almost nothing and has no moving parts, a getter is itself a vacuum pump. Getters cannot react permanently with inert gases, though some getters will absorb them in a reversible fashion. Also, hydrogen is usually handled by adsorption rather than reaction. Types To avoid being contaminated by the atmosphere, the getter must be introduced into the vacuum system in an inactive form during assembly, and activated after evacuation. This is usually done by heat. on Pete Miller's Tubebooks website Different types of getter use different ways of doing this: *Flashed getter ‚Äì The getter material is held inactive in a reservoir during assembly and initial evacuation, and then heated and evaporated, usually by induction heating. The vaporized getter, usually a volatile metal, instantly reacts with any residual gas, and then condenses on the cool walls of the tube in a thin coating, the getter spot or getter mirror, which continues to absorb gas. This is the most common type, used in low-power vacuum tubes. *Non-evaporable getter (NEG) ‚Äì The getter remains in solid form. Coating getter ‚Äì a coating applied to metal parts of the vacuum system that will be heated during use. Usually a nonvolatile metal powder sintered in a porous coating to the surface of the electrodes of power vacuum tubes, maintained at temperatures of 200¬∞ to 1200 ¬∞C during operation. Bulk getter ‚Äì sheets, strips, wires, or sintered pellets of gas absorbing metals which are heated, either by mounting them on hot components or by a separate heating element. These can often be renewed or replaced Getter pump or sorption pump ‚Äì In laboratory vacuum systems, the bulk NEG getter is often held in a separate vessel with its own heater, attached to the vacuum system by a valve, so that it can be replaced or renewed when saturated. *Ion getter pump ‚Äì Uses a high voltage electrode to ionize the gas molecules and drive them into the getter surface. These can achieve very low pressures and are important in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) systems. Flashed getters Dead vacuum fluorescent display (air has leaked in and getter spot became white) Flashed getters are prepared by arranging a reservoir of volatile and reactive material inside the vacuum system. After the system has been evacuated and sealed, the material is heated (usually by radio frequency induction heating). After evaporating, it deposits as a coating on the interior surfaces of the system. Flashed getters (typically made with barium) are commonly used in vacuum tubes. Most getters can be seen as a silvery metallic spot on the inside of the tube's glass envelope. Large transmission tubes and specialty systems often use more exotic getters, including aluminium, magnesium, calcium, sodium, strontium, caesium, and phosphorus. If the getter is exposed to atmospheric air (for example, if the tube breaks or develops a leak), it turns white and becomes useless. For this reason, flashed getters are only used in sealed systems. A functioning phosphorus getter looks very much like an oxidised metal getter, although it has an iridescent pink or orange appearance which oxidised metal getters lack. Phosphorus was frequently used before metallic getters were developed. In systems which need to be opened to air for maintenance, a titanium sublimation pump provides similar functionality to flashed getters, but can be flashed repeatedly. Alternatively, nonevaporable getters may be used. Those unfamiliar with sealed vacuum devices, such as vacuum tubes/thermionic valves, high- pressure sodium lamps or some types of metal-halide lamps, often notice the shiny flash getter deposit and mistakenly think it is a sign of failure or degradation of the device. Contemporary high-intensity discharge lamps tend to use non-evaporable getters rather than flash getters. Those familiar with such devices can often make qualitative assessments as to the hardness or quality of the vacuum within by the appearance of the flash getter deposit, with a shiny deposit indicating a good vacuum. As the getter is used up, the deposit often becomes thin and translucent, particularly at the edges. It can take on a brownish-red semi-translucent appearance, which indicates poor seals or extensive use of the device at elevated temperatures. A white deposit, usually barium oxide, indicates total failure of the seal on the vacuum system, as shown in the fluorescent display module depicted above. =Activation= The typical flashed getter used in small vacuum tubes (seen in 12AX7 tube, top) consists of a ring-shaped structure made from a long strip of nickel, which is folded into a long, narrow trough, filled with a mixture of barium azide and powdered glass, and then folded into the closed ring shape. The getter is attached with its trough opening facing upward toward the glass, in the specific case depicted above. During activation, while the bulb is still connected to the pump, an RF induction heating coil connected to a powerful RF oscillator operating in the 27 MHz or 40.68 MHz ISM band is positioned around the bulb in the plane of the ring. The coil acts as the primary of a transformer and the ring as a single shorted turn. Large RF currents flow in the ring, heating it. The coil is moved along the axis of the bulb so as not to overheat and melt the ring. As the ring is heated, the barium azide decomposes into barium vapor and nitrogen. The nitrogen is pumped out and the barium condenses on the bulb above the plane of the ring forming a mirror-like deposit with a large surface area. The powdered glass in the ring melts and entraps any particles which could otherwise escape loose inside the bulb causing later problems. The barium combines with any free gas when activated and continues to act after the bulb is sealed off from the pump. During use, the internal electrodes and other parts of the tube get hot. This can cause adsorbed gases to be released from metallic parts, such as anodes (plates), grids, or non-metallic porous parts, such as sintered ceramic parts. The gas is trapped on the large area of reactive barium on the bulb wall and removed from the tube. Non-evaporable getters Non-evaporable getters, which work at high temperature, generally consist of a film of a special alloy, often primarily zirconium; the requirement is that the alloy materials must form a passivation layer at room temperature which disappears when heated. Common alloys have names of the form St (Stabil) followed by a number: *St 707 is 70% zirconium, 24.6% vanadium, and the balance iron. *St 787 is 80.8% zirconium, 14.2% cobalt, and the balance mischmetal. *St 101 is 84% zirconium and 16% aluminium. In tubes used in electronics, the getter material coats plates within the tube which are heated in normal operation; when getters are used within more general vacuum systems, such as in semiconductor manufacturing, they are introduced as separate pieces of equipment in the vacuum chamber, and turned on when needed. Deposited and patterned getter material is being used in microelectronics packaging to provide an ultra-high vacuum in a sealed cavity. To enhance the getter pumping capacity, the activation temperature must be maximized, considering the process limitations.High-Q MEMS gyroscope It is, of course, important not to heat the getter when the system is not already in a good vacuum.

A voltage regulator may use a simple feed-forward design or may include negative feedback. It may use an electromechanical mechanism, or electronic components. Depending on the design, it may be used to regulate one or more AC or DC voltages. Electronic voltage regulators are found in devices such as computer power supplies where they stabilize the DC voltages used by the processor and other elements. In automobile alternators and central power station generator plants, voltage regulators control the output of the plant. In an electric power distribution system, voltage regulators may be installed at a substation or along distribution lines so that all customers receive steady voltage independent of how much power is drawn from the line. Electronic voltage regulators A simple voltage/current regulator can be made from a resistor in series with a diode (or series of diodes). Due to the logarithmic shape of diode V-I curves, the voltage across the diode changes only slightly due to changes in current drawn or changes in the input. When precise voltage control and efficiency are not important, this design may be fine. Since the forward voltage of a diode is small, this kind of voltage regulator is only suitable for low voltage regulated output. When higher voltage output is needed, a zener diode or series of zener diodes may be employed. Zener diode regulators make use of the zener diode's fixed reverse voltage, which can be quite large. Feedback voltage regulators operate by comparing the actual output voltage to some fixed reference voltage. Any difference is amplified and used to control the regulation element in such a way as to reduce the voltage error. This forms a negative feedback control loop; increasing the open-loop gain tends to increase regulation accuracy but reduce stability. (Stability is avoidance of oscillation, or ringing, during step changes.) There will also be a trade-off between stability and the speed of the response to changes. If the output voltage is too low (perhaps due to input voltage reducing or load current increasing), the regulation element is commanded, up to a point, to produce a higher output voltage‚Äìby dropping less of the input voltage (for linear series regulators and buck switching regulators), or to draw input current for longer periods (boost-type switching regulators); if the output voltage is too high, the regulation element will normally be commanded to produce a lower voltage. However, many regulators have over-current protection, so that they will entirely stop sourcing current (or limit the current in some way) if the output current is too high, and some regulators may also shut down if the input voltage is outside a given range (see also: crowbar circuits).  Electromechanical regulators  Circuit design for a simple electromechanical voltage regulator. A voltage stabilizer using electromechanical relays for switching. Graph of voltage output on a time scale. In electromechanical regulators, voltage regulation is easily accomplished by coiling the sensing wire to make an electromagnet. The magnetic field produced by the current attracts a moving ferrous core held back under spring tension or gravitational pull. As voltage increases, so does the current, strengthening the magnetic field produced by the coil and pulling the core towards the field. The magnet is physically connected to a mechanical power switch, which opens as the magnet moves into the field. As voltage decreases, so does the current, releasing spring tension or the weight of the core and causing it to retract. This closes the switch and allows the power to flow once more. If the mechanical regulator design is sensitive to small voltage fluctuations, the motion of the solenoid core can be used to move a selector switch across a range of resistances or transformer windings to gradually step the output voltage up or down, or to rotate the position of a moving-coil AC regulator. Early automobile generators and alternators had a mechanical voltage regulator using one, two, or three relays and various resistors to stabilize the generator's output at slightly more than 6.7 or 13.4V to maintain the battery as independently of the engine's rpm or the varying load on the vehicle's electrical system as possible. The relay(s) modulated the width of a current pulse to regulate the voltage output of the generator by controlling the average field current in the rotating machine which determines strength of the magnetic field produced which determines the unloaded output voltage per rpm. Capacitors aren‚Äôt used to smooth the pulsed voltage as described earlier. The large inductance of the field coil stores the energy delivered to the magnetic field in an iron core so the pulsed field current doesn‚Äôt result in as strongly pulsed a field. Both types of rotating machine produce a rotating magnetic field that induces an alternating current in the coils in the stator. A generator uses a mechanical commutator, graphite brushes running on copper segments, to convert the AC produced into DC by switching the external connections at the shaft angle when the voltage would reverse. An alternator accomplishes the same goal using rectifiers that don‚Äôt wear down and require replacement. Modern designs now use solid state technology (transistors) to perform the same function that the relays perform in electromechanical regulators. Electromechanical regulators are used for mains voltage stabilisation  see AC voltage stabilizers below.  Automatic voltage regulator  Voltage regulator for generators. Generators, as used in power stations, ship electrical power production, or standby power systems, will have automatic voltage regulators (AVR) to stabilize their voltages as the load on the generators changes. The first AVRs for generators were electromechanical systems, but a modern AVR uses solid-state devices. An AVR is a feedback control system that measures the output voltage of the generator, compares that output to a set point, and generates an error signal that is used to adjust the excitation of the generator. As the excitation current in the field winding of the generator increases, its terminal voltage will increase. The AVR will control current by using power electronic devices; generally a small part of the generator's output is used to provide current for the field winding. Where a generator is connected in parallel with other sources such as an electrical transmission grid, changing the excitation has more of an effect on the reactive power produced by the generator than on its terminal voltage, which is mostly set by the connected power system. Where multiple generators are connected in parallel, the AVR system will have circuits to ensure all generators operate at the same power factor.Donald G. Fink, H. Wayne Beatty, Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers Eleventh Edition, Mc Graw Hill, 1978, , page 7-30 AVRs on grid-connected power station generators may have additional control features to help stabilize the electrical grid against upsets due to sudden load loss or faults.  AC voltage stabilizers = Coil-rotation AC voltage regulator = Basic design principle and circuit diagram for the rotating-coil AC voltage regulator. This is an older type of regulator used in the 1920s that uses the principle of a fixed-position field coil and a second field coil that can be rotated on an axis in parallel with the fixed coil, similar to a variocoupler. When the movable coil is positioned perpendicular to the fixed coil, the magnetic forces acting on the movable coil balance each other out and voltage output is unchanged. Rotating the coil in one direction or the other away from the center position will increase or decrease voltage in the secondary movable coil. This type of regulator can be automated via a servo control mechanism to advance the movable coil position in order to provide voltage increase or decrease. A braking mechanism or high ratio gearing is used to hold the rotating coil in place against the powerful magnetic forces acting on the moving coil. Magnetic mains regulator = Electromechanical = Electromechanical regulators called voltage stabilizers or tap-changers, have also been used to regulate the voltage on AC power distribution lines. These regulators operate by using a servomechanism to select the appropriate tap on an autotransformer with multiple taps, or by moving the wiper on a continuously variable auto transfomer. If the output voltage is not in the acceptable range, the servomechanism switches the tap, changing the turns ratio of the transformer, to move the secondary voltage into the acceptable region. The controls provide a dead band wherein the controller will not act, preventing the controller from constantly adjusting the voltage (\\"hunting\\") as it varies by an acceptably small amount. =Constant-voltage transformer= The ferroresonant transformer, ferroresonant regulator or constant-voltage transformer is a type of saturating transformer used as a voltage regulator. These transformers use a tank circuit composed of a high-voltage resonant winding and a capacitor to produce a nearly constant average output voltage with a varying input current or varying load. The circuit has a primary on one side of a magnet shunt and the tuned circuit coil and secondary on the other side. The regulation is due to magnetic saturation in the section around the secondary. The ferroresonant approach is attractive due to its lack of active components, relying on the square loop saturation characteristics of the tank circuit to absorb variations in average input voltage. Saturating transformers provide a simple rugged method to stabilize an AC power supply. Older designs of ferroresonant transformers had an output with high harmonic content, leading to a distorted output waveform. Modern devices are used to construct a perfect sine wave. The ferroresonant action is a flux limiter rather than a voltage regulator, but with a fixed supply frequency it can maintain an almost constant average output voltage even as the input voltage varies widely. The ferroresonant transformers, which are also known as Constant Voltage Transformers (CVTs) or ferros, are also good surge suppressors, as they provide high isolation and inherent short-circuit protection. A ferroresonant transformer can operate with an input voltage range ¬±40% or more of the nominal voltage. Output power factor remains in the range of 0.96 or higher from half to full load. Because it regenerates an output voltage waveform, output distortion, which is typically less than 4%, is independent of any input voltage distortion, including notching. Efficiency at full load is typically in the range of 89% to 93%. However, at low loads, efficiency can drop below 60%. The current-limiting capability also becomes a handicap when a CVT is used in an application with moderate to high inrush current like motors, transformers or magnets. In this case, the CVT has to be sized to accommodate the peak current, thus forcing it to run at low loads and poor efficiency. Minimum maintenance is required, as transformers and capacitors can be very reliable. Some units have included redundant capacitors to allow several capacitors to fail between inspections without any noticeable effect on the device's performance. Output voltage varies about 1.2% for every 1% change in supply frequency. For example, a 2 Hz change in generator frequency, which is very large, results in an output voltage change of only 4%, which has little effect for most loads. It accepts 100% single-phase switch-mode power supply loading without any requirement for derating, including all neutral components. Input current distortion remains less than 8% THD even when supplying nonlinear loads with more than 100% current THD. Drawbacks of CVTs are their larger size, audible humming sound, and the high heat generation caused by saturation. = Commercial use = A three-phase bank of voltage regulators used to control the voltage on long AC power distribution lines. This bank is mounted on a wooden pole structure. Each regulator weighs about 1200 kg and is rated 576 kVA. Voltage regulators or stabilizers are used to compensate for voltage fluctuations in mains power. Large regulators may be permanently installed on distribution lines. Small portable regulators may be plugged in between sensitive equipment and a wall outlet. Automatic voltage regulators are used on generator sets on ships, in emergency power supplies, on oil rigs, etc. to stabilize fluctuations in power demand. For example, when a large machine is turned on, the demand for power is suddenly a lot higher. The voltage regulator compensates for the change in load. Commercial voltage regulators normally operate on a range of voltages, for example 150‚Äì240 V or 90‚Äì280 V.  DC voltage stabilizers  Many simple DC power supplies regulate the voltage using either series or shunt regulators, but most apply a voltage reference using a shunt regulator such as a Zener diode, avalanche breakdown diode, or voltage regulator tube. Each of these devices begins conducting at a specified voltage and will conduct as much current as required to hold its terminal voltage to that specified voltage by diverting excess current from a non-ideal power source to ground, often through a relatively low-value resistor to dissipate the excess energy. The power supply is designed to only supply a maximum amount of current that is within the safe operating capability of the shunt regulating device. If the stabilizer must provide more power, the shunt regulator output is only used to provide the standard voltage reference for the electronic device, known as the voltage stabilizer. The voltage stabilizer is the electronic device, able to deliver much larger currents on demand.  Active regulators  Active regulators employ at least one active (amplifying) component such as a transistor or operational amplifier. Shunt regulators are often (but not always) passive and simple, but always inefficient because they (essentially) dump the excess current which is not available to the load. When more power must be supplied, more sophisticated circuits are used. In general, these active regulators can be divided into several classes: * Linear series regulators * Switching regulators * SCR regulators = Linear regulators = Linear regulators are based on devices that operate in their linear region (in contrast, a switching regulator is based on a device forced to act as an on/off switch). Linear regulators are also classified in two types: # series regulators # shunt regulators In the past, one or more vacuum tubes were commonly used as the variable resistance. Modern designs use one or more transistors instead, perhaps within an integrated circuit. Linear designs have the advantage of very \\"clean\\" output with little noise introduced into their DC output, but are most often much less efficient and unable to step-up or invert the input voltage like switched supplies. All linear regulators require a higher input than the output. If the input voltage approaches the desired output voltage, the regulator will \\"drop out\\". The input to output voltage differential at which this occurs is known as the regulator's drop-out voltage. Low-dropout regulators (LDOs) allow an input voltage that can be much lower (i.e., they waste less energy than conventional linear regulators). Entire linear regulators are available as integrated circuits. These chips come in either fixed or adjustable voltage types. Examples of some integrated circuits are the 723 general purpose regulator and 78 XX/79 XX series = Switching regulators = Switching regulator integrated circuit LM2676, 3 A step-down converter. Switching regulators rapidly switch a series device on and off. The duty cycle of the switch sets how much charge is transferred to the load. This is controlled by a similar feedback mechanism as in a linear regulator. Because the series element is either fully conducting, or switched off, it dissipates almost no power; this is what gives the switching design its efficiency. Switching regulators are also able to generate output voltages which are higher than the input, or of opposite polarity ‚Äî something not possible with a linear design. In switched regulators, the pass transistor is used as a \\"controlled switch\\" and is operated at either cutoff or saturated state. Hence the power transmitted across the pass device is in discrete pulses rather than a steady current flow. Greater efficiency is achieved since the pass device is operated as a low impedance switch. When the pass device is at cutoff, there is no current and dissipates no power. Again when the pass device is in saturation, a negligible voltage drop appears across it and thus dissipates only a small amount of average power, providing maximum current to the load. In either case, the power wasted in the pass device is very little and almost all the power is transmitted to the load. Thus the efficiency of a switched-mode power supply is remarkably high-in the range of 70-90%. Switched mode regulators rely on pulse width modulation to control the average value of the output voltage. The average value of a repetitive pulse waveform depends on the area under the waveform. If the duty cycle is varied, the average value of the voltage changes proportionally. Like linear regulators, nearly complete switching regulators are also available as integrated circuits. Unlike linear regulators, these usually require an inductor that acts as the energy storage element. The IC regulators combine the reference voltage source, error op-amp, pass transistor with short circuit current limiting and thermal overload protection. = Comparing linear versus switching regulators = Simple DC power supplies can be made with rectifiers. But they suffer from changes in the input or at load. This initiated the development of the linear regulator (series/shunt) circuits*. They maintain a constant voltage by varying their resistance to counterbalance input voltage change. Still, the efficiency of this system is poor. They are heavy and not flexible enough to be chosen for every application. So (SMPS) was designed. They use a high-frequency switch with varying duty cycle to maintain the output voltage. The output voltage variation caused by the switching is filtered out by an LC filter. Switched Mode Power Supply system owe their origin back to the days when the valve or tube car radios needed a large HT supply. Example: 150V DC to be generated from an automobile power system of normally 12V DC. Today we find their application in the most modern PC power supplies. Switched Mode Power Supply is basically DC-DC converters. If the input is AC, the input is first rectified to get the DC. So depending on the input, an SMPS may have two (DC- AC, AC-DC) or three (AC-DC, DC-AC, AC-DC ) stages. The two types of regulators have their different advantages: * Linear regulators are best when low output noise (and low RFI radiated noise) is required * Linear regulators are best when a fast response to input and output disturbances is required * At low power levels, linear regulators are cheaper and occupy less printed circuit board space * Switching regulators are best when power efficiency is critical (such as in portable computers), except that linear regulators are more efficient in a small number of cases (such as a 5 V microprocessor often in \\"sleep\\" mode fed from a 6 V battery, if the complexity of the switching circuit and the junction capacitance charging current means a high quiescent current in the switching regulator) * Switching regulators are required when the only power supply is a DC voltage, and a higher output voltage is required. * At power levels above a few watts, switching regulators are cheaper (for example, the cost of removing heat generated is less) = SCR regulators = Regulators powered from AC power circuits can use silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs) as the series device. Whenever the output voltage is below the desired value, the SCR is triggered, allowing electricity to flow into the load until the AC mains voltage passes through zero (ending the half cycle). SCR regulators have the advantages of being both very efficient and very simple, but because they can not terminate an ongoing half cycle of conduction, they are not capable of very accurate voltage regulation in response to rapidly changing loads. An alternative is the SCR shunt regulator which uses the regulator output as a trigger. Both series and shunt designs are noisy, but powerful, as the device has a low on resistance. = Combination or hybrid regulators = Many power supplies use more than one regulating method in series. For example, the output from a switching regulator can be further regulated by a linear regulator. The switching regulator accepts a wide range of input voltages and efficiently generates a (somewhat noisy) voltage slightly above the ultimately desired output. That is followed by a linear regulator that generates exactly the desired voltage and eliminates nearly all the noise generated by the switching regulator. Other designs may use an SCR regulator as the \\"pre-regulator\\", followed by another type of regulator. An efficient way of creating a variable-voltage, accurate output power supply is to combine a multi-tapped transformer with an adjustable linear post-regulator. Example of linear regulators= Transistor regulator = In the simplest case a common collector amplifier also known as emitter follower is used with the base of the regulating transistor connected directly to the voltage reference: center A simple transistor regulator will provide a relatively constant output voltage Uout for changes in the voltage Uin of the power source and for changes in load RL, provided that Uin exceeds Uout by a sufficient margin and that the power handling capacity of the transistor is not exceeded. The output voltage of the stabilizer is equal to the Zener diode voltage minus the base‚Äìemitter voltage of the transistor, UZ ‚àí UBE, where UBE is usually about 0.7 V for a silicon transistor, depending on the load current. If the output voltage drops for any external reason, such as an increase in the current drawn by the load (causing a decrease in the collector‚Äìemitter voltage to observe KVL), the transistor's base‚Äìemitter voltage (UBE) increases, turning the transistor on further and delivering more current to increase the load voltage again. Rv provides a bias current for both the Zener diode and the transistor. The current in the diode is minimal when the load current is maximal. The circuit designer must choose a minimum voltage that can be tolerated across Rv, bearing in mind that the higher this voltage requirement is, the higher the required input voltage Uin, and hence the lower the efficiency of the regulator. On the other hand, lower values of Rv lead to higher power dissipation in the diode and to inferior regulator characteristics. Rv is given by : R_\\\\text{v} = \\\\frac{\\\\max V_R}{\\\\min I_\\\\text{D} + \\\\max I_\\\\text{L} / (h_\\\\text{FE} + 1)}, where : min VR is the minimum voltage to be maintained across Rv, : min ID is the minimum current to be maintained through the Zener diode, : max IL is the maximum design load current, : hFE is the forward current gain of the transistor (IC/IB). = Regulator with an operational amplifier = The stability of the output voltage can be significantly increased by using an operational amplifier: center In this case, the operational amplifier drives the transistor with more current if the voltage at its inverting input drops below the output of the voltage reference at the non-inverting input. Using the voltage divider (R1, R2 and R3) allows choice of the arbitrary output voltage between Uz and Uin.  Regulator specification  The output voltage can only be held constant within specified limits. The regulation is specified by two measurements: * Load regulation is the change in output voltage for a given change in load current (for example, \\"typically 15 mV, maximum 100 mV for load currents between 5 mA and 1.4 A, at some specified temperature and input voltage\\"). * Line regulation or input regulation is the degree to which output voltage changes with input (supply) voltage changes - as a ratio of output to input change (for example, \\"typically 13 mV/V\\"), or the output voltage change over the entire specified input voltage range (for example, \\"plus or minus 2% for input voltages between 90 V and 260 V, 50-60 Hz\\"). Other important parameters are: * Temperature coefficient of the output voltage is the change with temperature (perhaps averaged over a given temperature range). * Initial accuracy of a voltage regulator (or simply \\"the voltage accuracy\\") reflects the error in output voltage for a fixed regulator without taking into account temperature or aging effects on output accuracy. * ' is the minimum difference between input voltage and output voltage for which the regulator can still supply the specified current. The input-output differential at which the voltage regulator will no longer maintain regulation is the dropout voltage. Further reduction in input voltage will result in reduced output voltage. This value is dependent on load current and junction temperature. * Inrush current or input surge current or switch-on surge is the maximum, instantaneous input current drawn by an electrical device when first turned on. Inrush current usually lasts for half a second, or a few milliseconds, but it is often very high, which makes it dangerous because it can degrade and burn components gradually (over months or years), especially if there is no inrush current protection. Alternating current transformers or electric motors in automatic voltage regulators may draw and output several times their normal full-load current for a few cycles of the input waveform when first energized or switched on. Power converters also often have inrush currents much higher than their steady state currents, due to the charging current of the input capacitance. * Absolute maximum ratings are defined for regulator components, specifying the continuous and peak output currents that may be used (sometimes internally limited), the maximum input voltage, maximum power dissipation at a given temperature, etc. * Output noise (thermal white noise) and output dynamic impedance may be specified as graphs versus frequency, while output ripple noise (mains \\"hum\\" or switch-mode \\"hash\\" noise) may be given as peak- to-peak or RMS voltages, or in terms of their spectra. * Quiescent current in a regulator circuit is the current drawn internally, not available to the load, normally measured as the input current while no load is connected and hence a source of inefficiency (some linear regulators are, surprisingly, more efficient at very low current loads than switch-mode designs because of this). * Transient response is the reaction of a regulator when a (sudden) change of the load current (called the load transient) or input voltage (called the line transient) occurs. Some regulators will tend to oscillate or have a slow response time which in some cases might lead to undesired results. This value is different from the regulation parameters, as that is the stable situation definition. The transient response shows the behaviour of the regulator on a change. This data is usually provided in the technical documentation of a regulator and is also dependent on output capacitance. * Mirror-image insertion protection means that a regulator is designed for use when a voltage, usually not higher than the maximum input voltage of the regulator, is applied to its output pin while its input terminal is at a low voltage, volt-free or grounded. Some regulators can continuously withstand this situation. Others might only manage it for a limited time such as 60 seconds (usually specified in the data sheet). For instance, this situation can occur when a three terminal regulator is incorrectly mounted on a PCB, with the output terminal connected to the unregulated DC input and the input connected to the load. Mirror-image insertion protection is also important when a regulator circuit is used in battery charging circuits, when external power fails or is not turned on and the output terminal remains at battery voltage.

It is part of the University of Minnesota system and was founded in 1960 as a public, co-educational, residential liberal arts college offering Bachelor of Arts degrees. History Although UMM officially opened its doors in 1960, the history of what became the current institution reaches to 1887. That year, the first building of the Morris Industrial School for Indians, an American Indian boarding school, was constructed on the site and run by the Roman Catholic Sisters of Mercy under contract to the US government. Beginning in 1898, the Office of Indian Affairs (today's Bureau of Indian Affairs) took over operations to introduce a more progressive curriculum. The school closed in 1909, under a congressionally authorized program to reduce the number of boarding schools in preference for locating schools on reservations, so that families and communities would not be broken up. The campus was transferred to the State of Minnesota under the agreement that American Indians would always be admitted free of tuition; the current UMM still follows this policy. In 1910 the University of Minnesota established a coeducational residential high school on the campus called the West Central School of Agriculture (WCSA). This was one of four such schools established by the University in outstate Minnesota to provide agricultural and home economics education to rural youth. The complex also included an agricultural research station. The WCSA operated for half a century, but declining enrollment in the late 1950s prompted the University of Minnesota to phase out its regional agricultural schools. The residents of the Morris region convinced the university to develop the campus as four-year college. The University of Minnesota Morris opened in September 1960, phasing in college classes year by year while phasing out the last high school class, which graduated in 1963. The only surviving building from the Morris Industrial School for Indians, an 1899 dormitory, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The oldest building on campus, it now serves as UMM's Multi-Ethnic Resource Center. In 2003 a historic district consisting of the dormitory and 10 buildings from the WCSA period was listed on the National Register as the West Central School of Agriculture and Experiment Station Historic District. It was listed for having national significance in the themes of agriculture and education. The district was nominated for being an excellent example of a residential agricultural high school, one of the longest running in the nation and one of the most intact. It was also a significant component of the University of Minnesota's nationally influential system of such facilities, and an important contributor to education and agriculture in west-central Minnesota. The WCSA campus buildings were mostly designed by state architect Clarence H. Johnston Sr. in American Craftsman style and built in the 1910s and 20s. The 11 contributing properties of the historic district consist of the Music Hall (1899, previously the Indian School boys' dormitory and now the Multi-Ethnic Resource Center), the Girls' Dormitory (1912, now Camden Hall), Spooner Hall (1912‚Äì13), the Cattle Barn (1914, now the Saddle Club Barn), the Engineering Building (1915, now the Welcome Center), the Dining Hall (1918, now Behmler Hall), Senior Hall (1920, now Blakely Hall), Agricultural Hall (1920‚Äì21, now John Q. Imholte Hall), the Infirmary (1923‚Äì24, now the Education Building), Junior Hall (1926, now Pine Hall), and the Seed House (1929). Academics Morris offers 35 majors and 32 minors, 13 education licensure areas, and nine pre-professional programs in education, the humanities, science and mathematics, and the social sciences. According to U.S. News & World Report, the five most popular majors on campus are Psychology, General; English Language and Literature, General; Biology/Biological Sciences, General; Business Administration and Management, General; and Economics, General. Morris strives to offer high-caliber academics at an affordable cost. It has been ranked as a Top Ten Public Liberal Arts College by Forbes magazine fifteen times.

Each night of the festival concludes with performances by student jazz combos, ensembles, and the guest artists backed by Morris Jazz I. Green campus In August 2009, Mother Jones Magazine chose the University of Minnesota Morris as one of its top 10 \\"cool schools\\" in the United States, stating that the school is great for alternative energy enthusiasts. Morris is one of the first public colleges to generate on-site renewable power from local resources, such as corn stover. At the south edge of campus, a biomass gasification plant‚Äîfueled by crop residues from nearby farms‚Äîgenerates steam. The biomass gasifier is part of an integrated system for heating and cooling campus buildings. The combined heat and power system includes a steam turbine, which generates renewable electricity from gasifier steam, and a steam‚Äîpowered absorption chiller. At the campus's Regional Fitness Center, locally manufactured solar thermal panels collect the sun's energy to heat swimming pool water. A solar photovoltaic system on the south side of the science building converts sunlight into electricity. On the glacial ridge overlooking the campus, two 1.65 megawatt wind turbines generate renewable electricity for the campus and the region. Shifting to renewable power is just one piece of the campus's comprehensive sustainability strategy. Other measures include historic building reuse, green building design and construction, conservation, local foods programs, hybrid vehicles, innovative curriculum, and community outreach. The Morris campus is a nationally recognized sustainability leader and serves as a model community. In August 2013 the University of Minnesota Morris opened the Green Prairie Living and Learning Community. Construction on the building began in December 2012. The building is designed to house 72 students including 4 community advisors and a hall director. The building will house students during summer for special events and camps. There are kitchen facilities, a central lounge and patio, and study space. The Green Prairie Living and Learning Community was designed to meet Minnesota B3 sustainability guidelines and LEED Gold certification. It is constructed with high thermal mass insulated concrete forms (ICF) to prevent winter heat loss and summer heat gain. This is the first Residence Hall on the Morris campus to have suites. Athletics UMM's athletic teams have experienced varied success during the school's history. The 1970s were marked by success in basketball and football. Olympic wrestler, Dennis Koslowski, wrestled for the Cougars in the early 1980s. After a move in the early 1990s as a non-scholarship Division II and a brief experiment with athletic scholarships, Cougar athletics found a more appropriate home in NCAA Division III's Upper Midwest Athletic Conference. They are the first member of the UMAC to be a public, state- supported institution ‚Äì all other members over the years were private institutions, usually with a religious affiliation. UMM was, in 1993, the first college in the United States to sponsor women's wrestling as an official varsity sport. The wrestling programs were cut in 2003 due to budget constraints. In 2006, a new men's soccer team was announced. In 2006, UM Morris opened a new football stadium named Big Cat Stadium, just south of the school's Regional Fitness Center. BCS is also used by the Morris Area High School Tigers. The new stadium replaced Cougar Field which had been used from 1970 to 2005. The school's first football field, named Miller Field, was used from 1961 to 1969. In 2006, the Minnesota Morris Cougars football team captured their first UMAC championship in the Hubert H. Humphry Metrodome signaling the end of coach Ken Crandall's coaching career at UMM. The last conference title for the Cougar football program was the Northern Intercollegiate Conference (NIC) title in 1987, the second of two straight NIC titles. Over the next three years, the Cougars suffered losing records under coach Todd Hickman. In 2010, the team overcame their preseason rating (tied for last) to end the season with a winning record (5‚Äì4) and ending in a three- way tie for 3rd in the conference. 2016 record (4-6) 2017 record (6-4), undefeated at home. Media University students operate the radio station \\"the U-90 alternative, the prairie's only alternative\\" 89.7 FM (KUMM). The University produces a television program that airs on PBS stations in the state. Pioneer Public Television carries Prairie Yard and Garden. UMM also has a student-run publication: The University Register, a newspaper which is published weekly. Residence halls The residence halls on campus are: *Clayton A.

Life  Melton was the son of Nicholas of Melton, and the brother of Henry de Melton, and John Melton. He was born in Melton in the parish of Welton, about nine miles from Kingston upon Hull. He was a contemporary of John Hotham, Chancellor of England and Bishop of Ely. The two prelates were often associated in public matters and were the most powerful churchmen of their period in England. Melton was Controller of the Wardrobe at the accession of Edward II in 1307 and was a pluralist through and through at the time of his elevation to the see of York. Among other things, he was also Archdeacon of Barnstaple and Provost of Beverley. He was Lord Privy Seal from 1307 to about 1312, having been Dean of St. Martin's-le-Grand at that time also.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 93 He was promoted to Keeper of the Household Wardrobe from 1314 to 1316. He was elected by the chapter of York within a month of Archbishop Greenfield's death, in December 1315, but difficulties arose and he was not consecrated until September 1317, at Avignon by Pope John XXII.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 282 While serving as archbishop, Melton had to deal with numerous cases of fugitive or rebellious nuns at the Benedictine nunnery St Clement's by York, most notably Joan of Leeds. Throughout Melton's archiepiscopate, he was actively concerned in the affairs of Scotland. Between 1318 and 1322, the Scots, under James Douglas, Lord of Douglas, made raids into Yorkshire, devastating great parts of the country, destroying churches and sacking the richest monasteries. These continued raids led to a dispute between the City of York and Melton regarding the responsibility for the upkeep of part of the city's motte and bailey defences known as the Old Baile.Cooper York p. 41 During the raid of 1319, the King was at the siege of Berwick and much of the trained soldiery was there with him. Archbishop Melton was ordered to collect what men he could and to lead them against the Scots. Clergy, friars and citizens of York were accordingly gathered and the result was the Battle of Myton (12 October 1319) on the Swale, in which the English were entirely routed. Queen Isabella, who was in York at the time, managed to escape to safety at Nottingham. Connected with the Scottish raids of 1322 was the battle of Boroughbridge, in which the Earl of Lancaster was taken prisoner, led from Boroughbridge to his own castle of Pontefract and there beheaded. Archbishop Melton had aided Lancaster at one point, and seems, in consequence, to have fallen into some disfavour with Edward II. By 1325 however, the King's good opinion had been recovered, since Melton then became Lord Treasurer of England until 1326.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 104 Melton did not desert Edward II in his latter days, regarding his imprisonment with great displeasure. Nor was he present at the coronation of Edward III, and is said afterwards to have been engaged in a dangerous intrigue to upset the new government, for which he was arrested, though acquitted. In January 1328, Melton married the young king to Philippa of Hainault. In 1330 he was reappointed Treasurer, but left the office in 1331. = Work and legacy = Melton completed the building of the nave of York Minster and his figure still remains above the great western portal. He is said to have assisted largely in building St. Patrick's Church, Patrington, in Holderness, and certainly gave much toward the fabric of Beverley Minster. He died 5 April 1340 at Cawood Palace, and was buried in the north aisle of the nave at York Minster, a memorial window installed shortly after his death being transferred to St James' Church, High Melton in the 1790s by the Dean of York, John Fountayne. Melton died very wealthy, having custody of many manors and estates. His heir was his nephew, William Melton of Aston, near Sheffield, who was the progenitor of one of the most powerful knightly families in the south of Yorkshire. Melton kept a detailed log of his activities while he was Archbishop of York, published as The Register of William Melton in five volumes.

It is about a man‚Äîarbitrarily named 'Mr. X'‚Äîwho befriends two conjoined twins. The songs are all sung in a rhythmic spoken word fashion, similar to talking blues. The entire lyrical content of the album is written in trochaic octameter, a rare poetic meter most famously used in Edgar Allen Poe's poem The Raven. A central motif of the album is the organ riff from \\"Double Shot (Of My Baby's Love)\\" by 1960s frat rock band The Swingin' Medallions. A companion soundtrack album, featuring most of the instrumental backing tracks, was also released. God in Three Persons received a 5-star rating from AllMusic. Storyline The album is the story of a Colonel Tom Parker-type character called Mr. X, who finds a pair of Siamese twins who have miraculous healing powers. He convinces them to let him manage their careers, touring them as holy healers and conducting services during which they cure the masses. Mr. X begins to lust after the \\"female\\" twin, then realizes that the twins' sexes are fluid rather than fixed. When he discovers that the twins are far more worldly than he had believed, and therefore less under his control, he plots a vicious rape in which he severs the connection between the two, splitting them forever. In the denouement, he realizes that his feelings for the twins were not being imposed on him by the twins, but came from within himself. The story is narrated in the first person by Mr. X. He is accompanied throughout by instrumental music and sung commentary by Laurie Amat, who acts as a \\"Greek Chorus\\" (and sings the opening credits on the first track).

It transmits information from the body to the primary somatosensory cortex in the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe of the brain.O'Sullivan, S. B., & Schmitz, T. J. (2007). Physical Rehabilitation (5th Edition ed.). Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Company. The pathway receives information from sensory receptors throughout the body, and carries this in nerve tracts in the white matter of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord to the medulla, where it is continued in the medial lemniscus, on to the thalamus and relayed from there through the internal capsule and transmitted to the somatosensory cortex. The name dorsal-column medial lemniscus comes from the two structures that carry the sensory information: the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, and the medial lemniscus in the brainstem. There are three groupings of neurons that are involved in the pathway: first-order neurons, second-order neurons, and third-order neurons. The first-order neurons are sensory neurons located in the dorsal root ganglia, that send their afferent fibers through the two dorsal columns ‚Äì the gracile fasciculus, or gracile tract, and the cuneate fasciculus, or cuneate tract. The first-order axons make contact with second- order neurons of the dorsal column nuclei (the gracile nucleus and the cuneate nucleus) in the lower medulla. The second-order neurons send their axons to the thalamus. The third-order neurons are in the ventral nuclear group in the thalamus and fibres from these ascend to the postcentral gyrus. Sensory information from the upper half of the body is received at the cervical level of the spinal cord and carried in the cuneate tract, and information from the lower body is received at the lumbar level and carried in the gracile tract. The gracile tract is medial to the more lateral cuneate tract. The axons of second-order neurons of the gracile and cuneate nuclei are known as the internal arcuate fibers and when they cross over the midline, at the sensory decussation in the medulla, they form the medial lemniscus which connects with thalamus; the axons synapse on neurons in the ventral nuclear group which then send axons to the postcentral gyrus in the parietal lobe. All of the axons in the DCML pathway are rapidly conducting, large, myelinated fibers. Structure Spinal cord tracts - tracts of the DCML pathway shown upper right. The DCML pathway is made up of the axons of first, second, and third- order sensory neurons, beginning in the dorsal root ganglia. The axons from the first-order neurons form the ascending tracts of the gracile fasciculus, and the cuneate fasciculus which synapse on the second-order neurons in the gracile nucleus and the cuneate nucleus known together as the dorsal column nuclei; axons from these neurons ascend as the internal arcuate fibers; the fibers cross over at the sensory decussation and form the medial lemniscus which connects with thalamus; the axons synapse on neurons in the ventral nuclear group which then send axons to the postcentral gyrus in the parietal lobe. The gracile fasciculus carries sensory information from the lower half of the body entering the spinal cord at the lumbar level. The cuneate fasciculus carries sensory information from the upper half of the body (upper limbs, trunk, and neck) entering the spinal cord at the cervical level. The gracile fasciculus is wedge-shaped on transverse section and lies next to the posterior median septum. Its base is at the surface of the spinal cord, and its apex directed toward the posterior gray commissure. The gracile fasciculus increases in size from inferior to superior. The cuneate fasciculus is triangular on transverse section, and lies between the gracile fasciculus and the posterior column, its base corresponding with the surface of the spinal cord. Its fibers, larger than those of the gracile fasciculus, are mostly derived from the same source, viz., the posterior nerve roots. Some ascend for only a short distance in the tract, and, entering the gray matter, come into close relationship with the cells of the dorsal nucleus, while others can be traced as far as the medulla oblongata, where they end in the gracile nucleus and cuneate nucleus. The two ascending tracts meet at the T6 level. Ascending tracts typically have three levels of neurons, namely first-order, second- order, and third-order neurons, that relay information from the physical point of reception to the actual point of interpretation in the brain. Neural connections in the DCML pathway. =First-order neurons=Periphery and spinal cord The first-order neuron is a left When an action potential is generated by a mechanoreceptor in the tissue, the action potential will travel along the peripheral axon of the first- order neuron. The first-order neuron is pseudounipolar in shape with its body in the dorsal root ganglion. The action signal will continue along the central axon of the neuron through the posterior root, into the posterior horn, and up the posterior column of the spinal cord. Axons from the lower body enter the posterior column below the level of T6 and travel in the midline section of the column called the gracile fasciculus. Axons from the upper body enter at or above T6 and travel up the posterior column on the outside of the gracile fasciculus in a more lateral section called the cuneate fasciculus. These fasciculi are in an area known as the posterior funiculus that lies between the posterolateral and the posterior median sulcus. They are separated by a partition of glial cells which places them on either side of the posterior intermediate sulcus. The column reaches the junction between the spinal cord and the medulla oblongata, where lower body axons in the gracile fasciculus connect (synapse) with neurons in the gracile nucleus, and upper body axons in the cuneate fasciculus synapse with neurons in the cuneate nucleus. First-order neurons secrete substance P in the dorsal horn as a chemical mediator of pain signaling. The dorsal horn of the spinal cord transmits pain and non-noxious signals from the periphery to the spinal cord itself. Adenosine is another local molecule that modulates dorsal horn pain transmission =Second-order neurons=Brainstem The neurons in these two nuclei (the dorsal column nuclei) are second-order neurons. Their axons cross over to the other side of the medulla and are now named as the internal arcuate fibers, that form the medial lemniscus on each side. This crossing over is known as the sensory decussation. At the medulla, the medial lemniscus is orientated perpendicular to the way the fibres travelled in their tracts in the posterior column. For example, in the column, lower limb is medial, upper limb is more lateral. At the medial lemniscus, axons from the leg are more ventral, and axons from the arm are more dorsal. Fibres from the trigeminal nerve (supplying the head) come in dorsal to the arm fibres, and travel up the lemniscus too. The medial lemniscus rotates 90 degrees at the pons. The secondary axons from neurons giving sensation to the head, stay at around the same place, while the leg axons move outwards. The axons travel up the rest of the brainstem, and synapse at the thalamus (at the ventral posterolateral nucleus for sensation from the neck, trunk, and extremities, and at the ventral posteromedial nucleus for sensation from the head). =Third-order neurons=Thalamus to cortex Axons from the third-order neurons in the ventral posterior nucleus in the thalamus, ascend the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Those originating from the head and the leg swap their relative positions. The axons synapse in the primary somatosensory cortex, with lower body sensation most medial (e.g., the paracentral lobule) and upper body more lateral. Function Discriminative sensation is well developed in the fingers of humans and allows the detection of fine textures. It also allows for the ability known as stereognosis, to determine what an unknown object is, using the hands without visual or audio input. This fine sensation is detected by mechanoreceptors called tactile corpuscles that lie in the dermis of the skin close to the epidermis. When these structures are stimulated by slight pressure, an action potential is started. Alternatively, proprioceptive muscle spindles and other skin surface touch receptors such as Merkel cells, bulbous corpuscles, lamellar corpuscles, and hair follicle receptors (peritrichial endings) may involve the first neuron in this pathway. The sensory neurons in this pathway are pseudounipolar, meaning that they have a single process emanating from the cell body with two distinct branches: one peripheral branch that functions somewhat like a dendrite of a typical neuron by receiving input (although it should not be confused with a true dendrite), and one central branch that functions like a typical axon by carrying information to other neurons (again, both branches are actually part of one axon). Clinical significance Damage to the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway below the crossing point of its fibers results in loss of vibration and joint sense (proprioception) on the same side of the body as the lesion. Damage above the crossing point result a loss of vibration and joint sense on the opposite side of the body to the lesion. The pathway is tested with Romberg's test. Damage to either of the dorsal column tracts can result in the permanent loss of sensation in the limbs. See Brown-S√©quard syndrome. Additional information The cuneate fasciculus, fasciculus cuneatus, cuneate tract, tract of Burdach, was named for Karl Friedrich Burdach. The gracile fasciculus, the tract of Goll, was named after Swiss neuroanatomist Friedrich Goll (1829‚Äì1903).

From Chicago Sinai's pulpit, he delivered rousing sermons on the social ills of the day and many Chicagoans, Jew and gentile alike, were in attendance. Appointed professor of rabbinical literature and philosophy at the University of Chicago in 1892, Hirsch also served on the Chicago Public Library board from 1885 to 1897. He took some part in politics as a member of the Republican Party. He was an influential exponent of advanced thought and Reform Judaism. He edited Der Zeitgeist (Milwaukee, 1880‚Äì82) and the Reform Advocate (1891‚Äì1923). He also edited the Department of the Bible of the Jewish Encyclopedia and contributed feminist articles to The American Jewess. He also wrote studies of the historical relationship of Judaism and Christianity, including appreciations of its founding figures Jesus and Paul. Hirsch is the namesake of the Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School of Communications, located in the Greater Grand Crossing neighborhood in Chicago. In keeping with his interest in education, Hirsch advised a wealthy congregant, Julius Rosenwald of Sears, Roebuck & Co., to use part of his wealth to help build public schools for black students in the segregated South; their facilities were consistently underfunded. The rural school building program, based on the use of matching funds from local communities, was one of the largest programs, but not the only, administered by the Rosenwald Fund. He was the maternal grandfather of U.S. Attorney General Edward Hirsch Levi.

Sometimes the use of the term \\"warblog\\" implies that the blog concerned has a pro-war slant. The term \\"milblog\\" implies that the author is with the military. History The coinage 'warblog' is attributed to Matt Welch, who started his War Blog within days of the September 11 attacks. In the fall of 2001, the attacks gave rise to a \\"war-blogging movement,\\" which favoured political punditry over the often personal and technological orientation that had dominated the blog genre up to that point, achieving much greater public and media recognition than earlier blogs. Most warblogs supported the US-led War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War from a hawkish perspective. Warblogging was popularized by Glenn Reynolds, whose Instapundit was one of the most popular political blogs on the web. Some prominent warblogs, such as Little Green Footballs by Charles Johnson and Daily Dish by Andrew Sullivan existed before September 11, but made the war on terror their primary focus afterwards. Other notable warblogs included Dynamist by Virginia Postrel, KausFiles by Mickey Kaus, Talking Points Memo by Josh Marshall, KenLayne.com by Ken Layne, and Lileks.com by James Lileks. The readership of warblogs dramatically increased in March 2003, following the U.S. invasion of Iraq, with readers chiefly attracted by the offer of perspectives absent from most news reports; the pseudonymous Salam Pax, an Iraqi national who was posting first-hand accounts from Baghdad, emerged as a prominent war blogger. Media organisations that started their own reporters' warblog at this point included the BBC, the Christian Science Monitor, and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. In the first half of 2003, CNN, The Hartford Courant, and Time were among the media organizations that prohibited staff reporters from covering US-led wars first-hand in their personal blogs for fear both of legal repercussions and of competition from such blogs. Most blogs that gained popularity as \\"warblogs\\" expanded their focus to politics and general news, usually from a right-of-center perspective, yet continued to be commonly known as warblogs. While warblogs arose in response to the post- September-11 wars and mostly limited their commentary to them, some moved on to related political, social and cultural issues and continued after the end of the wars. =Milblogs= Military blogs emerged with the Iraq War in 2003. Initially named \\"warblogs\\" as well, they became popular under the name \\"milblogging\\"in 2004. In October 2005, a U.S. soldier named Jean-Paul Borda launched the blog aggregator Milblogging.com. A milblog is primarily focused on the events of the military, written about by those with inside knowledge of the military, whether an active soldier, a veteran of the military, a spouse of a soldier, or a civilian with a special connection to the military. Milblogs often criticized the media coverage of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, seeking to correct what they saw as biased or negative reporting. Thus, Matt Burden of Blackfive.net cites as the rationale of his blog the death in combat of a fellow soldier and good friend of his, who died saving the life of a magazine reporter, yet had his death go unreported by the magazine. One milblogger chose to offer his site \\"as an educational service to the American People who wish to know the true story of Iraq and Afghanistan.\\" Other milblogs cite similar intentions to report the news that they did not feel the mainstream media was reporting. C.J. Grisham was among the first active duty soldiers to become a milblogger when he opened A Soldier's Perspective in December 2004.\\"Julie Howe & CJ Grisham,\\" PatriotWatch.com. Within five years, ASP was receiving an average of 1,500 visitors per day (nearly 1 million in total) from over 120 countries and was ranked the second most popular site on Milblogging.com. In 2005, there were fewer than 200 \\"milblogs\\" in existence. In July 2011, Milblogging.com listed more than 3,000 military blogs in 46 countries. The top 5 locations were US, Iraq, Afghanistan, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Response by U.S. Military Military blogs became accepted within a few years. Whereas secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld was at first believed to be skeptical of military blogs, by 2007 president George W. Bush lauded them as \\"an important voice for the cause of freedom.\\" Official oversight of websites maintained by military personnel deployed to the Middle East began in 2002. The oversight mission consisted of active-duty soldiers and contractors, as well as Guard and Reserve members from Maryland, Texas and Washington state. Its remit was expanded in August 2005. In Iraq, commanding officers shut down a blog that reported on the medical response to a suicide bombing that had taken place in late 2004 in Mosul. The Army Web Risk Assessment Cell was created to monitor compliance with military regulations. In April 2005, a four-page document of regulations was issued by Multi- National Corps-Iraq, directing all military bloggers in Iraq to register with their units, and commanders to conduct quarterly reviews to make sure bloggers were not disclosing casualty numbers or violating operational security or privacy rules. Some milbloggers took down or altered their blogs for fear of violating the regulation that many of them believed to be too ambiguous. The regulations were updated in April 2007 but, according to many bloggers in war theatres, failed to resolve their ambiguities. Although the U.S. Department of Defense was initially concerned about milblogs as a potential OPSEC violation, it eventually embraced the concept and attempted to implement official versions of milblogs. Official milblogs did not receive the same reception or popularity of the unofficial milblogs as they were written in the same dull language as other official publications of the Defense Department.

ASJ serves members of a general audience that have shared interests in Japan. Founded in 1872 as , ASJ is Japan's oldest learned society. The Honorary Patron is Hisako, Princess Takamado. The Representative Director and President as of September 2019 is H.E. Ambassador Yoshinori Kato. Overview The Asiatic Society of Japan's founders set into motion coordinated activities \\"to collect and publish information on subjects relating to Japan and other Asiatic Countries.\\" They intentionally differentiated ASJ from its affiliated Royal Asiatic societies of the day by having established ASJ as a \\"Society for scholarly gentlemen\\" rather than a society of scholars. Nor was \\"Royal\\" to be used in ASJ's title, a measure to encourage Japanese people to join. Women also began to join within a few years. ASJ quickly became the first organization of its kind in Japan to promote the sharing of discoveries about Japan to the rest of the world. ASJ was founded at a meeting held on 8 October 1872 at the Grand Hotel, Yokohama, when Robert Grant Watson of the British Legation was elected the first President, and the first papers were read there on 30 October‚ÄîNotes on Loochoo by Ernest Mason Satow, then Japanese Secretary at the British Legation, and The Hyalonema Mirabilis, a marine biological study by Henry Hadlow, a Royal Navy surgeon. The opening papers were significant for two reasons: the subjects themselves, and the presence of Dr. James Curtis Hepburn and Satow at the very beginning of the ASJ's life. ASJ's founders and earliest members were adventurous leaders who became pillars of Japan's modernization and industrialization at the dawn of Meiji Period. Physicians, scientists, teachers, engineers, military officers, lawyers, and diplomats numbered among them. In those days, there were numerous organizations like ASJ, each in their own way serving as focal points for documenting and discussing the discoveries that were being made by the men who were participating in the building of a new Japan. Many members of ASJ were also members of the other organizations. Japanese members who were central to the Meiji Restoration included: Kan≈ç Jigor≈ç, Baron Naibu Kanda, Tsuda Sen, Nakamura Masanao, and Viscount Mori Arinori. The 'foreign expert' group was, likewise, a roster of the famous: Dr. James Curtis Hepburn; Henry Hadlow; Josiah Conder; John Milne, Edward Divers, James Main Dixon and Charles Dickinson West, all of the Imperial College of Engineering; Henry Faulds of the Tsukiji Hospital; Robert Maclagan of the Osaka Mint; Basil Hall Chamberlain; and William George Aston and Sir Ernest Mason Satow, diplomats. ASJ, embracing a core of pioneers with the self-imposed task of interpreting the Japanese and their civilization to the rest of the world, played a highly significant part in transmitting new standards of critical and technical excellence to a whole generation of Japanese teachers and students, which, once adopted, made the 'foreign experts' superfluous. By the 1890s, ASJ's first generation of Japanese and foreign members‚Äîleaders of change in Meiji‚Äîbegan to move on. Academicians began to make-up more of the membership. Today, the membership is approximately: academicians (46%); businesspeople (36%); students, fine arts, clergy, retired and other (18%). ASJ is still active today. Members meet monthly to hear a guest explain discoveries based on original research. The lectures last approximately fifty minutes and are followed by questions and discussion. Topics have come from the full spectrum of fields of knowledge as related to Japan, including culture, history, literature, science, business, politics, and economics. Publications The Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan is a journal that contains the full texts of selected papers presented at meetings, as well as other papers submitted for publication. The ASJ also publishes a monthly newsletter known as the Bulletin, which contains a detailed summary of the previous month's lecture, lecturers' profiles, announcements of coming events, and news about the ASJ and its members. For most of the ASJ's history, there has been no limit to the range of interests covered in the pursuit of the objective. The first ten volumes of the Society's Transactions, 1872-1882, printed 146 papers, of which 25 can be roughly classified as geographical or topographical. They are, however, far outnumbered by the largest subject grouping: the scientific papers during the same period. Hadlow alone submitted 52 such studies, and there were many others. But to take the figures further, during the second decade, 1882-1892, 107 papers were printed, of which only 4 were geographical and 18 scientific, a reflection of the end of the 'exploration' phase of Meiji. The men who contributed to the exploration phase and to the explosive growth of the ASJ during its first 20 years began to wind-up their activities and move to their next opportunities. On the occasion of the 110th Anniversary of the ASJ, after having completed his historical account of the first one-hundred years of the ASJ, President Douglas Moore Kenrick remarked to Their Imperial Highnesses and members present: \\"The only requirement of authors, and this is the root of our policy, is that each is expected to tell us something in his or her field that has not been previously published. We ask for something new. The Transactions have covered an extraordinarily wide range of Japanese studies and the papers provide a fascinating conspectus of Western achievements in the field of Japanology over the decades, as well as useful examinations of many subjects that have not been treated elsewhere.\\"  Early Presidents  * 1872‚Äì1873: Robert Grant Watson * 1873‚Äì1874: Dr James Curtis Hepburn * 1874‚Äì1876: Samuel Robbins Brown * 1876‚Äì1878: Harry Smith Parkes * 1878‚Äì1879: David Murray * 1879‚Äì1880: Edward W.

Joseph Bertrand introduced it in his work Calcul des probabilit√©s (1889),Bertrand, Joseph (1889), \\"Calcul des probabilit√©s\\", Gauthier-Villars, p. 5-6. as an example to show that the principle of indifference may not produce definite, well-defined, results for probabilities if it is applied uncritically when the domain of possibilities is infinite. Bertrand's formulation of the problem The Bertrand paradox is generally presented as follows: Consider an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle. Suppose a chord of the circle is chosen at random. What is the probability that the chord is longer than a side of the triangle? Bertrand gave three arguments (each using the principle of indifference), all apparently valid, yet yielding different results: # Random chords, selection method 1; red = longer than triangle side, blue = shorter The \\"random endpoints\\" method: Choose two random points on the circumference of the circle and draw the chord joining them. To calculate the probability in question imagine the triangle rotated so its vertex coincides with one of the chord endpoints. Observe that if the other chord endpoint lies on the arc between the endpoints of the triangle side opposite the first point, the chord is longer than a side of the triangle. The length of the arc is one third of the circumference of the circle, therefore the probability that a random chord is longer than a side of the inscribed triangle is . # Random chords, selection method 2 The \\"random radial point\\" method: Choose a radius of the circle, choose a point on the radius and construct the chord through this point and perpendicular to the radius. To calculate the probability in question imagine the triangle rotated so a side is perpendicular to the radius. The chord is longer than a side of the triangle if the chosen point is nearer the center of the circle than the point where the side of the triangle intersects the radius. The side of the triangle bisects the radius, therefore the probability a random chord is longer than a side of the inscribed triangle is . # Random chords, selection method 3 The \\"random midpoint\\" method: Choose a point anywhere within the circle and construct a chord with the chosen point as its midpoint. The chord is longer than a side of the inscribed triangle if the chosen point falls within a concentric circle of radius the radius of the larger circle. The area of the smaller circle is one fourth the area of the larger circle, therefore the probability a random chord is longer than a side of the inscribed triangle is . These three selection methods differ as to the weight they give to chords which are diameters. This issue can be avoided by \\"regularizing\\" the problem so as to exclude diameters, without affecting the resulting probabilities. But as presented above, in method 1, each chord can be chosen in exactly one way, regardless of whether or not it is a diameter; in method 2, each diameter can be chosen in two ways, whereas each other chord can be chosen in only one way; and in method 3, each choice of midpoint corresponds to a single chord, except the center of the circle, which is the midpoint of all the diameters. Scatterplots Showing Simulated Bertrand Distributions, Midpoints/Chords Chosen at Random Using 1 of 3 Methods. {-  Midpoints of the chords chosen at random using method 1  Midpoints of the chords chosen at random using method 2  Midpoints of the chords chosen at random using method 3 -  Chords chosen at random, method 1  Chords chosen at random, method 2  Chords chosen at random, method 3 } Other methods can easily be imagined to select midpoints and chords; many engender distributions with a different proportion of chords that are longer than a side of the inscribed triangle. Classical solution The problem's classical solution (presented, for example, in Bertrand's own work) hinges on the method by which a chord is chosen \\"at random\\". The argument is that if the method of random selection is specified, the problem will have a well-defined solution (determined by the principle of indifference). The three solutions presented by Bertrand correspond to different selection methods, and in the absence of further information there is no reason to prefer one over another; accordingly, the problem as stated has no unique solution. This and other paradoxes of the classical interpretation of probability justified more stringent formulations, including frequentist probability and subjectivist Bayesian probability. Jaynes's solution using the \\"maximum ignorance\\" principle In his 1973 paper \\"The Well-Posed Problem\\", Edwin Jaynes proposed a solution to Bertrand's paradox, based on the principle of \\"maximum ignorance\\"‚Äîthat we should not use any information that is not given in the statement of the problem. Jaynes pointed out that Bertrand's problem does not specify the position or size of the circle, and argued that therefore any definite and objective solution must be \\"indifferent\\" to size and position. In other words: the solution must be both scale and translation invariant. To illustrate: assume that chords are laid at random onto a circle with a diameter of 2, say by throwing straws onto it from far away and converting them to chords by extension/restriction. Now another circle with a smaller diameter (e.g., 1.1) is laid into the larger circle. Then the distribution of the chords on that smaller circle needs to be the same as the restricted distribution of chords on the larger circle (again using extension/restriction of the generating straws). Thus, if the smaller circle is moved around within the larger circle, the restricted distribution should not change. It can be seen very easily that there would be a change for method 3: the chord distribution on the small red circle looks qualitatively different from the distribution on the large circle: 320px The same occurs for method 1, though it is harder to see in a graphical representation. Method 2 is the only one that is both scale invariant and translation invariant; method 3 is just scale invariant, method 1 is neither. However, Jaynes did not just use invariances to accept or reject given methods: this would leave the possibility that there is another not yet described method that would meet his common-sense criteria. Jaynes used the integral equations describing the invariances to directly determine the probability distribution. In this problem, the integral equations indeed have a unique solution, and it is precisely what was called \\"method 2\\" above, the random radius method. In a 2015 article, Alon Drory argued that Jaynes' principle can also yield Bertrand's other two solutions. Drory argues that the mathematical implementation of the above invariance properties is not unique, but depends on the underlying procedure of random selection that one uses (as mentioned above, Jaynes used a straw-throwing method to choose random chords). He shows that each of Bertrand's three solutions can be derived using rotational, scaling, and translational invariance, concluding that Jaynes' principle is just as subject to interpretation as the principle of indifference itself. For example, we may consider throwing a dart at the circle, and drawing the chord having the chosen point as its center. Then the unique distribution which is translation, rotation, and scale invariant is the one called \\"method 3\\" above. Likewise, \\"method 1\\" is the unique invariant distribution for a scenario where a spinner is used to select one endpoint of the chord, and then used again to select the orientation of the chord. Here the invariance in question consists of rotational invariance for each of the two spins. It is also the unique scale and rotation invariant distribution for a scenario where a rod is placed vertically over a point on the circle's circumference, and allowed to drop to the horizontal position (conditional on it landing partly inside the circle). Physical experiments \\"Method 2\\" is the only solution that fulfills the transformation invariants that are present in certain physical systemssuch as in statistical mechanics and gas physicsin the specific case of Jaynes's proposed experiment of throwing straws from a distance onto a small circle. Nevertheless, one can design other practical experiments that give answers according to the other methods. For example, in order to arrive at the solution of \\"method 1\\", the random endpoints method, one can affix a spinner to the center of the circle, and let the results of two independent spins mark the endpoints of the chord. In order to arrive at the solution of \\"method 3\\", one could cover the circle with molasses and mark the first point that a fly lands on as the midpoint of the chord. Several observers have designed experiments in order to obtain the different solutions and verified the results empirically. Recent developments In his 2007 paper, \\"Bertrand‚Äôs Paradox and the Principle of Indifference\\", Nicholas Shackel affirms that after more than a century the paradox remains unresolved, and continues to stand in refutation of the principle of indifference. Shackel emphasizes that two different approaches have been generally adopted so far in trying to solve Bertrand's paradox: those where a distinction between non-equivalent problems was considered, and those where the problem was assumed to be a well-posed one. Shackel cites Louis Marinoff as a typical representative of the distinction strategy, and Edwin Jaynes as a typical representative of the well-posing strategy. However, in a recent work, \\"Solving the hard problem of Bertrand's paradox\\", Diederik Aerts and Massimiliano Sassoli de Bianchi consider that a mixed strategy is necessary to tackle Bertrand's paradox. According to these authors, the problem needs first to be disambiguated by specifying in a very clear way the nature of the entity which is subjected to the randomization, and only once this is done the problem can be considered to be a well-posed one, in the Jaynes sense, so that the principle of maximum ignorance can be used to solve it. To this end, and since the problem doesn't specify how the chord has to be selected, the principle needs to be applied not at the level of the different possible choices of a chord, but at the much deeper level of the different possible ways of choosing a chord. This requires the calculation of a meta average over all the possible ways of selecting a chord, which the authors call a universal average. To handle it, they use a discretization method inspired by what is done in the definition of the probability law in the Wiener processes. The result they obtain is in agreement with the numerical result of Jaynes, although their well-posed problem is different from that of Jaynes.

Biography Born in Thalfang (in modern-day Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany; formerly part of Prussia), he received his training at Metz. He attended the University of Bonn, the University of Berlin, and the University of Leipzig. He first became rabbi at Dessau in 1838 but was forced to resign in 1841 because he promoted a radically liberal form of Judaism, later to become known as classic German Reform Judaism. In 1843 he published his \\"Die Messias-Lehre der Juden in Kanzelvortr√§gen\\" and \\"Religionsphilosophie der Juden.\\" In 1843 he was appointed chief rabbi of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg by King William II of the Netherlands. During this period he published his \\"Die Humanit√§t als Religion.\\" He took an active part in the annual rabbinical conferences held at Brunswick (1844), Frankfurt am Main (1845), and Breslau (1846). In 1844 he published his \\"Reform im Judenthum.\\" Having received a call from the Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1866, he resigned his post in Europe and moved to the United States. There he succeeded Dr. David Einhorn. From his arrival onward he became closely identified with, and an open advocate of, radical Reform. In 1869 he was elected president of the rabbinical conference held in Philadelphia, at which the principles of Reform Judaism were formulated. In that year he engaged also in numerous ritual and doctrinal controversies. Hirsch remained officiating rabbi of the Philadelphia congregation for 22 years, resigning in 1888, after having spent 50 years of his life in the ministry. Moving to Chicago, he took up his abode there with his son, philosopher and rabbi Prof. Emil G. Hirsch. During his rabbinate in Philadelphia Hirsch organized the Orphans' Guardian Society, and was the founder of the first branch in the United States of the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle. Hirsch is best known as the author of the \\"Religionsphilosophie,\\" a work written from the Hegelian point of view, but for the purpose of vindicating the claim of Judaism to the rank denied it by Hegel, the rank of an \\"absolute religion.\\" In this book he proved himself to be an original thinker (see \\"Allg.

His \\"Katechismus der Israelitischen Religion\\" was also constructed on original lines; he considered the Biblical legends to be psychological and typical allegories, and the ceremonies of Judaism to be symbols of underlying ideas. From this attitude his Reform principles are derived. He denied that Judaism is a law; it is Lehre (\\"teaching\\" or \\"lore\\") but is expressed in symbolic ceremonies that may be changed in accordance with historic development. He was the first to propose holding Jewish services on Sunday instead of the traditional Jewish Sabbath Shabbat. He contributed to the early volumes of The Jewish Times (1869‚Äì1878). His principal works were first issued in Germany, among them What is Judaism? (1838), a collection of sermons (1841), and Religious Philosophy of the Jews (1843). He published nothing in book form after coming to the United States. Hirsch died in Chicago, Illinois. References  * Elmar P. Ittenbach: \\"Samuel Hirsch. Rabbiner-Religionsphilosoph-Reformer.

The precise meaning depends upon the context. With respect to animals, the term describes which males and females mate under which circumstances. Recognised systems include monogamy, polygamy (which includes polygyny, polyandry, and polygynandry), and promiscuity, all of which lead to different mate choice outcomes and thus these systems affect how sexual selection works in the species which practice them. In plants, the term refers to the degree and circumstances of outcrossing. In human sociobiology, the terms have been extended to encompass the formation of relationships such as marriage. In plants The primary mating systems in plants are outcrossing (cross-fertilisation), autogamy (self-fertilisation) and apomixis (asexual reproduction without fertilization, but only when arising by modification of sexual function). Mixed mating systems, in which plants use two or even all three mating systems, are not uncommon. A number of models have been used to describe the parameters of plant mating systems. The basic model is the mixed mating model, which is based on the assumption that every fertilisation is either self-fertilisation or completely random cross-fertilisation. More complex models relax this assumption; for example, the effective selfing model recognises that mating may be more common between pairs of closely related plants than between pairs of distantly related plants. In animals Chimpanzees have a promiscuous mating system Male and female gorilla, gorillas have a polygynous mating system The following are some of the mating systems generally recognized in animals: *Monogamy: One male and one female have an exclusive mating relationship. The term \\"pair bonding\\" often implies this. This is associated with one-male, one-female group compositions. There are two types of monogamy: type 1, which is facultative, and type 2, which is obligate. Facultative monogamy occurs when there are very low densities in a species. This means that mating occurs with only a single member of the opposite sex because males and females are very far apart. When a female needs aid from conspecifics in order to have a litter this is obligate monogamy. However, with this, the habitat carrying capacity is small so it means only one female can breed within the habitat. *Polygamy: Three types are recognized: Polygyny (the most common polygamous mating system in vertebrates so far studied): One male has an exclusive relationship with two or more females. This is associated with one-male, multi-female group compositions. Many perennial Vespula squamosa (southern yellowjacket) colonies are polygynous.Pickett, K. M., Osborne, D. M., Wahl, D., and Wenzel, J. W. (2001). \\"An Enormous Nest of Vespula squamosa from Florida, the Largest Social Was Nest Reported from North America, with Notes on Colony Cycle and Reproduction\\", \\"Journal of the New York Entomological Society\\", 2001. Different types of polygyny exist, such as lek polygyny and resource defense polygyny. Grayling butterflies (Hipparchia semele) engage in resource defense polygyny, where females choose a territorial male based on the best oviposition site. Although most animals opt for only one of these strategies, some exhibit hybrid strategies, such as the bee species, Xylocopa micans. Polyandry: One female has an exclusive relationship with two or more males. This is very rare and is associated with multi-male, multi-female group compositions. Genetic polyandry is found some insect species such as Apis mellifera (the Western Honey Bee), in which a virgin queen will mate with multiple drones during her nuptial flight whereas each drone will die immediately upon mating once. The queen will then store the sperm collected from these multiple matings in her spermatheca to use to fertilize eggs throughout the course of her entire reproductive life. Polygynandry: Polygynandry is a slight variation of this, where two or more males have an exclusive relationship with two or more females; the numbers of males and females do not have to be equal, and in vertebrate species studied so far, the number of males is usually less. This is associated with multi-male, multi- female group compositions. *Promiscuity: A member of one sex within the social group mates with any member of the opposite sex. This is associated with multi-male, multi-female group compositions. These mating relationships may or may not be associated with social relationships, in which the sexual partners stay together to become parenting partners. As the alternative term \\"pair bonding\\" implies, this is usual in monogamy. In many polyandrous systems, the males and the female stay together to rear the young. In polygynous systems where the number of females paired with each male is low and the male will often stay with one female to help rear the young, while the other females rear their young on their own. In polygynandry, each of the males may assist one female; if all adults help rear all the young, the system is more usually called \\"communal breeding\\". In highly polygynous systems, and in promiscuous systems, paternal care of young is rare, or there may be no parental care at all. These descriptions are idealized, and the social partnerships are often easier to observe than the mating relationships. In particular: *the relationships are rarely exclusive for all individuals in a species. DNA fingerprinting studies have shown that even in pair-bonding, matings outside the pair (extra-pair copulations) occur with fair frequency, and a significant minority of offspring result from them. However, the offspring that are a result of extra-pair copulations usually exhibit more advantageous genes. These genes can be associated with improvements in appearance, mating, and the functioning of internal body systems. *some species show different mating systems in different circumstances, for example in different parts of their geographical range, or under different conditions of food availability *mixtures of the simple systems described above may occur. Sexual conflict occurs between individuals of different sexes that have separate or conflicting requirements for optimal mating success. This conflict may lead to competitive adaptations and co-adaptations of one or both of the sexes to maintain mating processes that are beneficial to that sex. Intralocus sexual conflict and interlocus sexual conflict describe the genetic influence behind sexual conflict, and are presently recognized as the most basic forms of sexual conflict. =In humans= Compared to other vertebrates, where a species usually has a single mating system, human display great variety. Humans also differ by having formal marriages which in some cultures involve negotiation and arrangement between elder relatives. Regarding sexual dimorphism (see the section about animals above), humans are in the intermediate group with moderate sex differences in body size but with relatively large testes, indicating relatively frequent sperm competition in socially monogamous and polygynous human societies. One estimate is that 83% of human societies are polygynous, 0.05% are polyandrous, and the rest are monogamous. Even the last group may at least in part be genetically polygynous.The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007, Chapter 30 Ecological and socio-cultural impacts on mating and marriage systems by Bobbi S. Low From an evolutionary standpoint, females are more prone to practice monogamy because their reproductive success is based on the resources she is able to acquire through reproduction rather than the quantity of offspring she produces. However, men are more likely to practice polygamy because his reproductive success is based on the amount of offspring he produces, rather than any kind of benefit from parental investment. Polygyny is associated with an increased sharing of subsistence provided by women. This is consistent with the theory that if women raise the children alone, men can concentrate on the mating effort. Polygyny is also associated with greater environmental variability in the form of variability of rainfall. This may increase the differences in the resources available to men. An important association is that polygyny is associated with a higher pathogen load in an area which may make having good genes in a male increasingly important. A high pathogen load also decreases the relative importance of sororal polygyny which may be because it becomes increasingly important to have genetic variability in the offspring (See Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection). Virtually all the terms used to describe animal mating systems were adopted from social anthropology, where they had been devised to describe systems of marriage. This shows that human sexual behavior is unusually flexible since, in most animal species, one mating system dominates. While there are close analogies between animal mating systems and human marriage institutions, these analogies should not be pressed too far, because in human societies, marriages typically have to be recognized by the entire social group in some way, and there is no equivalent process in animal societies. The temptation to draw conclusions about what is \\"natural\\" for human sexual behavior from observations of animal mating systems should be resisted: a socio-biologist observing the kinds of behavior shown by humans in any other species would conclude that all known mating systems were natural for that species, depending on the circumstances or on individual differences. As culture increasingly affects human mating choices, ascertaining what is the 'natural' mating system of the human animal from a zoological perspective becomes increasingly difficult. Some clues can be taken from human anatomy, which is essentially unchanged from the prehistoric past: *humans have a large relative size of testes to body mass in comparison to most primates; *humans have a large ejaculate volume and sperm count in comparison to other primates; *as compared to most primates, humans spend more time in copulation; *as compared to most primates, humans copulate with greater frequency; *the outward signs of estrus in women (i.e. higher body temperature, breast swelling, sugar cravings, etc.), are often perceived to be less obvious in comparison to the outward signs of ovulation in most other mammals; *for most mammals, the estrous cycle and its outward signs bring on mating activity; the majority of female-initiated matings in humans coincides with estrus, but humans copulate throughout the reproductive cycle; *after ejaculation/orgasm in males and females, humans release a hormone that has a sedative effect; however human females may remain sexually receptive and may remain in the plateau stage of orgasm if their orgasm has not been completed. Some have suggested that these anatomical factors signify some degree of sperm competition, though as levels of genetic and societal promiscuity are highly varied across cultures, this evidence is far from conclusive. In microorganisms=Bacteria= Mating in bacteria involves transfer of DNA from one cell to another and incorporation of the transferred DNA into the recipient bacteria's genome by homologous recombination. Transfer of DNA between bacterial cells can occur in three main ways. First, a bacterium can take up exogenous DNA released into the intervening medium from another bacterium by a process called transformation. DNA can also be transferred from one bacterium to another by the process of transduction, which is mediated by an infecting virus (bacteriophage). The third method of DNA transfer is conjugation, in which a plasmid mediates transfer through direct cell contact between cells. Transformation, unlike transduction or conjugation, depends on numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process, and thus transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer. In order for a bacterium to bind, take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state termed natural competence. In Bacillus subtilis about 40 genes are required for the development of competence and DNA uptake. The length of DNA transferred during B. subtilis transformation can be as much as a third and up to the whole chromosome. Transformation appears to be common among bacterial species, and at least 60 species are known to have the natural ability to become competent for transformation. The development of competence in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions, and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells.Bernstein H, Bernstein C, Michod RE (2012). DNA repair as the primary adaptive function of sex in bacteria and eukaryotes. Chapter 1: pp.1-49 in: DNA Repair: New Research, Sakura Kimura and Sora Shimizu editors. Nova Sci. Publ., Hauppauge, N.Y. https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=31918 =Archaea= In several species of archaea, mating is mediated by formation of cellular aggregates. Halobacterium volcanii, an extreme halophilic archaeon, forms cytoplasmic bridges between cells that appear to be used for transfer of DNA from one cell to another in either direction. When the hyperthermophilic archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius are exposed to the DNA damaging agents UV irradiation, bleomycin or mitomycin C, species-specific cellular aggregation is induced. Aggregation in S. solfataricus could not be induced by other physical stressors, such as pH or temperature shift, suggesting that aggregation is induced specifically by DNA damage. Ajon et al. showed that UV-induced cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency in S. acidocaldarius. Recombination rates exceeded those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude. Frols et al. and Ajon et al. hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species-specific DNA transfer between Sulfolobus cells in order to provide increased repair of damaged DNA by means of homologous recombination. This response appears to be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that are also associated with species specific DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage. =Protists= Protists are a large group of diverse eukaryotic microorganisms, mainly unicellular animals and plants, that do not form tissues. Eukaryotes emerged in evolution more than 1.5 billion years ago. The earliest eukaryotes were likely protists. Mating and sexual reproduction are widespread among extant eukaryotes. Based on a phylogenetic analysis, Dacks and Roger proposed that facultative sex was present in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes. However, to many biologists it seemed unlikely until recently, that mating and sex could be a primordial and fundamental characteristic of eukaryotes. A principal reason for this view was that mating and sex appeared to be lacking in certain pathogenic protists whose ancestors branched off early from the eukaryotic family tree. However, several of these protists are now known to be capable of, or to recently have had, the capability for meiosis and hence mating. To cite one example, the common intestinal parasite Giardia intestinalis was once considered to be a descendant of a protist lineage that predated the emergence of meiosis and sex. However, G. intestinalis was recently found to have a core set of genes that function in meiosis and that are widely present among sexual eukaryotes. These results suggested that G. intestinalis is capable of meiosis and thus mating and sexual reproduction. Furthermore, direct evidence for meiotic recombination, indicative of mating and sexual reproduction, was also found in G. intestinalis. Other protists for which evidence of mating and sexual reproduction has recently been described are parasitic protozoa of the genus Leishmania, Trichomonas vaginalis, and acanthamoeba. Protists generally reproduce asexually under favorable environmental conditions, but tend to reproduce sexually under stressful conditions, such as starvation or heat shock. =Viruses= Both animal viruses and bacterial viruses (bacteriophage) are able to undergo mating. When a cell is mixedly infected by two genetically marked viruses, recombinant virus progeny are often observed indicating that mating interaction had occurred at the DNA level. Another manifestation of mating between viral genomes is multiplicity reactivation (MR). MR is the process by which at least two virus genomes, each containing inactivating genome damage, interact with each other in an infected cell to form viable progeny viruses. The genes required for MR in bacteriophage T4 are largely the same as the genes required for allelic recombination. Examples of MR in animal viruses are described in the articles Herpes simplex virus, Influenza A virus, Adenoviridae, Simian virus 40, Vaccinia virus, and Reoviridae. In arthropods=Fruit flies= Fruit flies like A. suspensa have demonstrated polygamy. The males often attract females through marking where they will perch and release air-borne pheromones from the tip of their abdomen to mark and defend individual leaves.

Edmonds. The film was produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and directed by John Ford. Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert portray settlers on the New York frontier during the American Revolution. The couple suffer British, Tory, and Indian attacks on their farm before the Revolution ends and peace is restored. Edmonds based the novel on a number of historic figures who lived in the valley. The film‚ÄîFord's first Technicolor feature‚Äîwas well received. It was nominated for two Academy Awards and became a major box office success, grossing over US$1 million in its first year. Plot In colonial America, Lana Borst (Claudette Colbert), the eldest daughter of a wealthy family, marries Gilbert Martin (Henry Fonda). Together they leave her family's luxurious home to embark on a frontier life on Gil's small farm in Deerfield in the Mohawk Valley of central New York. The time is July 1776, and the spirit of revolution is in the air. The valley's mostly ethnic German settlers have formed a local militia in anticipation of an imminent war, and Gil joins up. As Gil and his neighbors are clearing his land for farming, Blue Back (Chief John Big Tree), a friendly Oneida man, arrives to warn them that a raiding party of Seneca, led by a Tory named Caldwell (John Carradine), is in the valley. The settlers leave their farms and take refuge in nearby Fort Schuyler. Lana, who is pregnant, miscarries during the frantic ride to the fort. The Martin farm is destroyed by the Seneca raiding party. With no home and winter approaching, the Martins accept work on the farm of a wealthy widow, Mrs. McKlennar (Edna May Oliver). During a peaceful interlude, Mrs. McKlennar and the Martins prosper. Then, word comes that a large force of British soldiers and Indians is approaching the valley. The militia sets out westward to intercept the attackers; but their approach is badly timed and the party is ambushed. Though the enemy is eventually defeated at Oriskany, more than half of the militiamen are killed. Gil returns home, wounded and delirious, but slowly recovers. Lana is again pregnant and delivers a son in May. That summer Indian and Tory raiding parties burn and pillage farms and small settlements. The harvest is small, and while Mrs. McKlennar's stone house is not burned, there is barely enough food to survive the winter. Lana bears her second child, another son, the following August. The raids continue but the crops fare much better, so there is plenty to eat that winter, although the cold is severe. After the spring thaw, the British and their Indian allies mount a major attack to take the valley, and the settlers again take refuge in the fort. Mrs. McKlennar is mortally wounded and ammunition runs short. Gil makes a heroic dash through enemy lines to secure help from nearby Fort Dayton. Reinforcements arrive just in time to beat back the attackers, who are about to overwhelm the fort. The militia pursues, harasses, and defeats the British force, scattering its surviving soldiers in the wilderness. The Mohawk Valley is saved. Three years later, with the war over, Gil and Lana return to their farm at Deerfield. They have a third child (a baby girl). They look forward to a happy and peaceful life in the valley as citizens of the new, independent United States of America.

Historical accuracy Like most of John Ford's films, Drums Along the Mohawk loosely is based on historical events. A central feature of the plot is the Battle of Oriskany, a pivotal engagement of the Saratoga campaign during the American Revolutionary War, in which a British contingent drove southward from Canada in an attempt to occupy the Hudson Valley and isolate Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Massachusetts from the remaining colonies.Boehlert, P. A. The Battle of Oriskany and General Nicholas Herkimer: Revolution in the Mohawk Valley. The History Press (2013), pp. 78-84. A smaller force invaded the Mohawk Valley as a diversion, but the siege of Fort Schuyler depicted in the film had no direct historical counterpart. The actual fort besieged during the battle‚ÄîFort Stanwix‚Äîwas situated far from any civilian settlements, and was attacked by British and Hessian soldiers aided by local Iroquois tribes, not solely by Indians; and was defended by Continental Army soldiers, not militiamen.Boehlert (2013), pp. 99-102. The Tryon County militia, under General Nicholas Herkimer, did attempt to assist in the fort's defense, but they were ambushed on their way there by a predominantly Indian force at Oriskany, six miles east of Stanwix.Simms, JR. History of Schohairie County, and Border Wars of New York. Albany, New York: Munsell and Tanner Printers, 1845, pp. 232‚Äì3 Some sources contend that the attacks on settlements in the Mohawk Valley likewise lacked a historical basis, and were included because Ford felt obliged to perpetuate the mythology;The American War of Independence: Three Films. HistoryExtra (BBC).

The film portrays only Indians and Tories as antagonists; British soldiers are seldom referenced or seen. While local Indian tribes and Tory loyalists were a factor in the actual Mohawk Valley campaign,Rollins, PC. Hollywood's Indian: The Portrayal of the Native American in Film. The University Press of Kentucky (2003), pp. 74-5. their role was a minor one compared to that of the British Army. Ford chose to minimize the British role because of the political situation in 1939: \\"He knew that war with Germany was coming, and he had little desire to show the British as villains when they were fighting for their lives against the Nazis.\\"Drums Along the Mohawk. historyonfilm.com.

It served as an impregnable citadel during various regimes of different dynasties, including the Musunuri Nayaks, Qutb Shahi‚Äôs and Asaf Jahis. The fort was situated in a very vast area in the heart of the City of Khammam. It was notified as a protected monument by the Archaeology Department several decades ago. Despite decades of neglect, the historical edifice, which once flourished with regal opulence, presents its alluring charm due to its architectural splendor. Etymology The historical records show that the earlier name was \\"Kambham mettu\\" or \\"Stambhadri\\".Khammam, Telangana State Potal, retrieved 15 April 2019. \\"Mettu\\" means hill or highland in the Telugu language. The name was also anglicised as \\"Commomet\\" and \\"Khammammet\\".  Construction  The Khammam Fort was built by Musunuri Nayaks. Several inscriptions were discovered in the surrounding areas of Khammam and Krishna districts of Musunuri Nayaks. Khammam slowly became an independent territory within the kingdom of Kakatiyas for Musunuri Nayaks. 75 Telugu speaking feudatories of the region under the leadership of Musunuri Nayaks fought for 10 long years to unify the Telugu land and succeeded in repulsing them out of country. Architecture & Significant Features * This Fort is located in an area of 4 Sq. miles in the heart of the City of Khammam on top of a massive granite Hill. It is surrounded by a huge rock wall averaging between 40 and 80 feet(13 to 25 Meters) in height and 15 to 20 feet(4.5 to 6 Meters) in width. There are steps from each buruju (bastion) to enter into the fort. The Fort was considered practically impregnable by invading armies. * A number of balconies and windows are constructed along the wall in order to use the artillery during wartime. It has a capacity of mounting at least 60 cannons at a time. * The fort 10 large gates most of them in poor shape now. Each gate has cannons mounted on them along with a water pot made of rocks. They are built such that an impact of a cannonball could not break it. * The main entrance is a 30-foot tall entrance known as the Khilla darwaza (meaning fort gate in Urdu). It has 2 cannons on either side of the entrance. One of them still mounted with a head. They are now partially destroyed due to the negligence of the archeology department. * The east gate or the secondary entrance is equally large and is popularly known as the Raathi Darwaza (meaning stone entrance in Urdu) or Potha Darwaza. * All other gates are smaller than the main entrance and could have been constructed to avoid large cavalries to enter the fort in case of an attack. * A huge rainwater catchment system and well have been constructed on the Khilla during the period of Zafar-ud-doula, well known for construction of tanks during Qutb shahi dynasty. This massive tank is now known as the 'Zafar well'. It is 60 feet X 30 feet stepped well with a bridge across it for men and horses to move around. He also built the walls using Bricks and limestone along the fort. * As soon as we enter the Khilla darwaza, one can see the Fort at a distance of 300 feet. There are small steps carved out of this hill to reach the top of the Hill fort. They are later renovated with railings for the steps by the Tourism department and Archaeological Survey of India in 2005 during the 1000 year celebrations of this historical fort. A lot of small gates known as 'Dalohiswar' are all around the walls of the fort. * Fort has at least 15 bastions constructed with two massive walls as a military strategy to take the impact of the cannonballs and to counter the enemy from the top. A 15-foot deep trench is dug in some places for the army to store and use as a hiding place. * The huge blocks of stone used for the walls are as long as 10 feet and are believed to be transported using elephants and men. No mud or limestone is used in this huge wall and the rocks are tightly placed and leaving the viewers amazed by the construction * A permanent Gallows has been erected on this prominent hill fort, where the estimated seat of justice could have been inside the fort.The platform is made of Stone and appears like a well, due to which the locals call this 'Nethi bhavi' ('‡∞®‡±á‡∞§‡∞ø ‡∞¨‡∞æ‡∞µ‡∞ø 'meaning Ghee well). This stone structure could be seen from allover the city of khammam.Stone Gallows, locally believed to be a Ghee well on top of the fort * The fort is believed to have a secret tunnels to the Warangal Fort with multiple entrances in different locations at the fort. One such entrance is 10 feet in diameter and the steps to enter the tunnel are closed due to damage over the years. The local folklore includes stories about valuables being transferred between the kings from here using the secret passages and escaping enemy attacks through them.  Culture  This Fort appears to be a replicate the cultures of both Hindu and Muslim rulers who ruled this fort city. The Lakshmi Narasimha swami temple in Brahmin bazar, Sri Ramalingeshwara temple is one of the oldest shivalayam(Shiva temple) are some of the oldest Hindu temples in Telangana and are older than the fort itself. During the Qutb shahi dynasty, many new places of worship have been constructed in and around the fort such as the Khilla masjid.  Encroachments  The fort, once mighty bastion of royal dynasties, continues to face further encroachment threat due to lack of proper monitoring mechanism. Large settlements occupied the areas in and around the fort due to the lack of proper monitoring of encroachments. Destruction of the granite hill and construction of houses continues till today around the fort area. Ruins of the Cannons inside the fort  Development  The historic Khammam fort, a living testimony to the majestic grandeur and architectural marvel of the bygone era, is poised to get a face lift with the government departments drawing up grand plans to beautify and develop the majestic edifice. Illumination of the fort, including installation of solar streetlights atop the fort, introduction of the sound and light show at the historical edifice and development of a park at the entrance of the fort, are some of the initiatives in the pipeline. With the Telangana government laying renewed focus on the historical edifices of architectural significance, the government departments turned their attention on beautifying the Khammam fort and safeguarding the protected monument from future encroachments.A proposal to develop a park and set up a canteen besides illuminating the fort at an estimated cost of Rs. 5 crore has already been submitted to the government, says Suman Chakravarthi, District Tourism Officer, Khammam. The plan also envisages provision of amenities and introduction of sound and light show at the fort on the lines of the Golconda Fort in Hyderabad, he elaborates.A plan is on the anvil to install solar streetlights at the fort, says G.

The Rockaway River is a tributary of the Passaic River, approximately 35 mi (56 km) long, in northern New Jersey in the United States. The upper course of the river flows through a wooded mountainous valley, whereas the lower course flows through the populated New Jersey suburbs and former industrial area west of New York City. It drains an area of approximately 130 sq mi (340 km¬≤). It rises at the eastern edge of Sussex County and within a few hundred yards enters Morris County, in the Highlands, along the northwestern slope of Green Pond Mountain south of Oak Ridge. It flows SSW, in a direct course between in the valley between the mountain ridges. Northeast of Wharton it emerges from the mountains and flows generally east in a meandering course, past Wharton, Dover (where it enters a concrete channel), Rockaway, Denville and Boonton, where it passes through the Boonton Gorge. The gorge begins with the impressive 25 foot Boonton Falls. It continues for a little over 1 mile (1.6 km) dropping around through nearly continuous class 3 and 4 whitewater. On the south side of Boonton it is impounded to form the Boonton Reservoir. Downstream from the reservoir dam it flows south, through Lake Hiawatha, where the river splits and joins again. It then flows through Parsippany and into Hatfield Swamp, where it is joined by the Whippany River and then merges with the Passaic River. Beaver brook is a stream that flows through a swamp and enters the Rockaway River in Denville. In the 19th century the river connected to the Morris Canal near Wharton and served as an industrial transportation link for shipping coal and iron ore between Pennsylvania and New York City. The communities of Wharton, Dover, and Boonton were important iron processing towns in the early 19th century, with a large concentration of forges and mills. The significant pollution problem in the lower course of the river has been somewhat alleviated by legislation and by the nearly complete abandonment of heavy industry in the area. The isolated upper course of the river is a popular region site for smallmouth bass fishing. The New Jersey Fish and Game stocks the river in many sections with rainbow and brown trout. Many fisherman find enjoyment in fishing the river. The river is shown in the movie, The Station Agent, and also appears in one episode of The Sopranos. Flooding The Rockaway River has the potential to cause flooding in the area of Denville that is north of the central business district, including residential areas along the river. During the massive flooding following Hurricane Irene in August 2011, the Rockaway River crested approx. 6 feet above its previous record flood level. The flooding was considered to be a 500-year event. The downtown Denville business district and surrounding residential areas were flooded, by in some places up to 8 feet of water. As silt has accumulated in the river basin, the average depth of the river has steadily decreased. Since the flooding of Irene there have been no problems reported with the river overreaching its banks. Discussions are ongoing with the Township of Denville and the Army Corps of Engineers as to a solution, including the control of dams upstream which may have contributed to the downtown flooding.

As a border region contested between France and Germany, the Saar has a somewhat complicated philatelic history. (Note that although the state is now known as Saarland, English-speaking philatelists universally use \\"Saar\\".)  League of Nations administration  Originally a German territory of great interest to France, after World War I the Territory of the Saar Basin was to be administered by the League of Nations for a period of 15 years. In the absence of an existing nation to take over mail delivery, the League established its own postal administration. The first stamps of the Saar were contemporary German stamps overprinted \\"Sarre\\" (the French name) and with a heavy solid bar striking out the \\"DEUTSCHES REICH\\" at the bottom of the stamp. This overprint was applied to 17 denominations, ranging from 2 pfennig to 1 mark, and first went on sale 30 January 1920. The stamps of Bavaria were overprinted similarly, and first available on 1 March. On 26 March, more German overprints were issued, this time reading \\"SAARGEBIET\\" (the German language name for Saar Territory) and not striking out the name of the old Reich. Surcharges of 20pf, 5m, and 10m on German stamps came out in early 1921, followed by the Saar's first definitive series. This was a set of 16 local scenes, ranging from a view of the Saar River near Mettlach to the Burbach Steelworks at Dillingen. The stamps were somewhat rudely typographed and most were printed in two colors; although bordering on the garish, they are striking nevertheless. On 1 May 1921, the series was surcharged in centimes and francs, and in 1922 it was replaced by a new series of same designs, but redrawn, denominated in the new money, and printed in different colors. The Madonna of Blieskastel was commemorated by a pair of stamps (45c and 10fr) in 1925, then in 1927 a new definitive series came out, still borrowing designs from the first series, but now in different shapes, and printed in a single color using photogravure. On 1 November 1934, in preparation for the plebiscite the following year, this series was overprinted \\"VOLKSABSTIMMUNG / 1935\\"; the plebiscite in January 1935 having gone in favor of rejoining Germany, Saar came under the German postal system.  French administration  After World War II, Saar was one of the occupied areas to come under the administration of France. On 28 July 1945 the postal service in the Saar Area was separated from that in the French zone of occupation in Allied-occupied Germany, forming the Oberpostdirektion Saar (High Postal Directorate of the Saar) in Saarbr√ºcken. Postal services were provided again starting in August 1945 for official purposes, and private mail, at the beginning to a restricted extent only, was resumed in September. The first stamps valid only in the Saar Area were issued in 1947. A first set of definitives came out in mid-1947, and included 17 stamps using six designs, including workers of various occupations, Mettlach Abbey, and Marshal Ney. Three of these values were also printed on paper watermarked with a pattern of curving lines. These first stamps were denominated in German currency, but just as before, were replaced in November by French currency denominations. The postal tariffs were adapted to the French system with mail to France at the domestic rate and mail to Allied-occupied Germany at the foreign tariff. The postal service of the Bizone subsumed mail to the Saar Protectorate under the foreign postage only as of 1 October 1948. On 17 November 1947 the Oberpostdirektion Saar was transformed into the Post-, Telegraphen- und Telephonverwaltung des Saarlandes (abbreviated like the French correspondent entity as P.T.T. Saarland; Post, Telegraph and Telephone Administration of the Saarland), keeping the headquarters in Saarbr√ºcken. Postal vehicles and postboxes were green (RAL 6001), like in France. The French established the Saar Protectorate in December 1947, and on 1 April 1948 the P.T.T. Saarland issued a new series inscribed \\"SAARPOST\\", followed by another in 1949 inscribed \\"SAAR\\". The P.T.T. Saarland issued a few commemoratives each year through 1956, punctuated by a definitive set showing various buildings, in 1952. After the 1955 Saar Statute referendum failed, France accepted the prevailing preference of the Saar population to return to Germany. So following that, mail to West Germany, East Germany or either part of Berlin was charged again with the domestic postage.  German administration  On 1 January 1957 the P.T.T. Saarland was transformed into the Oberpostdirektion Saarbr√ºcken of the Deutsche Bundespost. The return of the Saar Area to German control was commemorated on 1 January 1957 by a special stamps, then followed shortly thereafter by definitives with the then-standard profile of President Theodor Heuss, and inscribed both \\"SAARLAND\\" and \\"DEUTSCHE BUNDESPOST\\". The numerals did not indicate a monetary system, but were implicitly francs; later in 1957, the stamps were reissued with a small \\"F\\" after the numeral. Starting on 8 July 1957 mail from the Saarland to France, the French dominions, Italy and Luxembourg was not subsumed under the domestic tariff any more, but under a preferential postage granted until 30 June 1959, when the general foreign postage started to apply. Additional commemoratives appeared regularly for several more years while the German monetary system was re-established on 6 July 1959. The last postage stamp of the Saar was a single 15-franc issue honoring Alexander von Humboldt, which went on sale 6 May 1959. Thereafter Saarland used the regular stamps of the Federal Republic of Germany.

He is concurrently serving 35 life sentences, plus 1,035 years, all without the possibility of parole, in Hobart's Risdon Prison. Childhood Martin Bryant was born on 7 May 1967 at the Queen Alexandria Hospital in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. He was the first son of Maurice and Carleen Bryant. Although the family home was 65 Augusta Road, Lenah Valley, Tasmania, Bryant spent some of his childhood at their beach home in Carnarvon Bay, Tasmania. In a 2011 interview, his mother recalled that while Bryant was very young, she would often find his toys broken, and said he was an \\"annoying\\" and \\"different\\" child. A psychologist's view was that Bryant would never hold down a job, as he would aggravate people to such an extent that he would always be in trouble. Other cases that locals can recall include that he had pulled the snorkel from another boy while diving and had once cut down trees on a neighbour's property. He was described by teachers as being distant from reality and unemotional. At school he was a disruptive and sometimes violent child who suffered severe bullying by other children. After he was suspended from New Town Primary School in 1977, psychological assessments of Bryant noted his torturing of animals. He returned to school the following year with improved behaviour; however, he persisted in teasing younger children. He was transferred to a special education unit at New Town High School in 1980, where he deteriorated both academically and in behaviour throughout his remaining school years. = Psychological and psychiatric assessments = Descriptions of Bryant's behaviour as an adolescent show that he continued to be disturbed and outlined the possibility of an intellectual disability. When leaving school in 1983, Bryant was assessed for a disability pension by a psychiatrist who wrote: \\"Cannot read or write. Does a bit of gardening and watches TV ... Only his parents' efforts prevent further deterioration. Could be schizophrenic and parents face a bleak future with him.\\" Bryant received a disability pension, though he also worked as a handyman and gardener. In an examination after the massacre, forensic psychiatrist Ian Joblin found Bryant to be borderline mentally disabled, with an I.Q. of 66, equivalent to an 11-year-old. While awaiting trial, Bryant was examined by court-appointed psychiatrist Ian Sale, who was of the opinion that Bryant \\"could be regarded as having shown a mixture of conduct disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity and a condition known as Asperger Syndrome\\". Psychiatrist Paul Mullen, hired at the request of Bryant's legal counsel, found that Bryant was socially and intellectually impaired. Furthermore, finding that he did not display signs of schizophrenia or a mood disorder, Mullen concluded, \\"Though Mr. Bryant was clearly a distressed and disturbed young man, he was not mentally ill\\". Bryant was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome while incarcerated at Risdon Prison.  Adulthood  In early 1987, when Bryant was 19, he met 54-year-old Helen Mary Elizabeth Harvey, heiress to a share in the Tattersall's lottery fortune, while looking for new customers for his lawnmowing service. Harvey, who lived with her mother Hilza, befriended Bryant, who became a regular visitor to her neglected mansion at 30 Clare St., New Town and assisted with tasks such as feeding the 14 dogs living inside the house and the 40 cats living inside her garage. In June 1990, someone reported Harvey to the health authorities, and medics found both Harvey and her mother in need of urgent hospital treatment. Hilza Harvey died several weeks later at the age of 79. A cleanup order was placed on the mansion, and Bryant's father took long-service leave to assist in cleaning the interior. Harvey now invited Bryant to live with her in the mansion, and they began spending large amounts of money, which included the purchase of more than thirty new cars in less than three years. The couple began to spend most days shopping, usually after having lunch in a local restaurant. Around this time, Bryant was reassessed for his pension and a note was attached to the paperwork: \\"Father protects him from any occasion which might upset him as he continually threatens violence ‚Ä¶ Martin tells me he would like to go around shooting people. It would be unsafe to allow Martin out of his parents' control\\". In 1991, as a result of no longer being allowed to have animals at the house, Harvey and Bryant moved together onto a farm called Taurusville that she had purchased at 2340 Arthur Highway, Copping, a small township. Neighbours recalled that he always carried an air gun and often fired it at tourists as they stopped to buy apples at a stall on the highway, and that late at night he would roam through the surrounding properties firing the gun at dogs when they barked at him. They avoided him \\"at all costs\\" despite his attempts to befriend them. On 20 October 1992, Harvey was killed when her car veered to the wrong side of the road and hit an oncoming car directly. Bryant was inside the vehicle at the time of the accident, and was hospitalised for seven months with severe neck and back injuries. He was briefly investigated by police for the role he played in the accident, as Bryant had a known habit of lunging for the steering wheel, and Harvey had already had three accidents as a result. She often told people that this was the reason she never drove faster than 60 kilometres an hour (37 mph). Bryant was named the sole beneficiary of Harvey's will and came into possession of assets totaling more than $550,000. As Bryant had only the \\"vaguest notions\\" of financial matters, his mother subsequently applied for and was granted a guardianship order, placing Bryant's assets under the management of Public Trustees. The order was based on evidence of Bryant's diminished intellectual capacity. After Harvey's death, Bryant's father Maurice looked after the Copping farm. Bryant returned to the family home to convalesce after leaving hospital. His father had been prescribed antidepressants, and had discreetly transferred his joint bank account and utilities into his wife's name. Two months later, on 14 August 1993, a visitor looking for Maurice Bryant at the Copping property found a note saying \\"call the police\\" pinned to the door and found several thousand dollars in his car. The rates officer at the time found no reason to suspect criminal intent, and sent council members and police to quell the stresses put forward by letters sent to the local council chambers. Police searched the property for Maurice Bryant without success. Divers were called in to search the four dams on the property, and on 16 August, his body was found in the dam closest to the farmhouse with one of Bryant's diving weight belts around his neck. Police described the death as \\"unnatural\\", and it was ruled a suicide. Bryant inherited the proceeds of his father's superannuation fund, valued at $250,000. Bryant sold the Copping farm for $143,000 and kept the Hobart mansion. While living at Copping, the white overalls he habitually wore were replaced with clothing more in line with Harvey's financial status. Now that he was alone, his dress became more bizarre. He often wore a grey linen suit, cravat, lizard-skin shoes and a Panama hat while carrying a briefcase during the day, telling anyone who would listen that he had a well-paying career. He often wore an electric-blue suit with flared trousers and a ruffled shirt to the restaurant he frequented. The restaurant owner recalled: \\"It was horrible. Everyone was laughing at him, even the customers. I really felt suddenly quite sorry for him. I realised this guy didn't really have any friends\\". With both his father and Harvey dead, Bryant became increasingly lonely. From 1993 to late 1995, he visited various overseas countries fourteen times and a summary of his domestic airline travel filled three pages. He hated the destinations he travelled to, as he found that people there avoided him just as they did in Tasmania. He enjoyed the flights, as he could speak to the people sitting adjacent to him who had no choice but to be polite. Bryant later took great joy in describing some of the more successful conversations he had with fellow passengers. In late 1995, he became suicidal after deciding he had \\"had enough\\". He stated, \\"I just felt more people were against me. When I tried to be friendly toward them, they just walked away\\". Although he had previously been little more than a social drinker, his alcohol consumption increased and, although he had not consumed any alcohol on that day, had especially escalated in the six months prior to the massacre. Bryant's average daily consumption was estimated at half a bottle of Sambuca and a bottle of Baileys Irish Cream, supplemented with port wine and other sweet alcoholic drinks. According to Bryant, he thought the plan for Port Arthur may have first occurred to him four to 12 weeks before the event.  Port Arthur massacre  Bryant has provided conflicting and confused accounts of what led him to kill 35 people at the Port Arthur site on 28 April 1996. It appears that it could be his desire for attention, as he allegedly told a next-door neighbour, \\"I'll do something that will make everyone remember me\\".Struggling with its massacre in silence, The Sydney Morning Herald, 7 February 2007 Bryant's defence psychiatrist Paul Mullen, former chief of forensic psychiatry at Monash University, said \\"He followed Dunblane. His planning started with Dunblane. Before that he was thinking about suicide, but Dunblane and the early portrayal of the killer, Thomas Hamilton, changed everything.\\" His first victims, David and Noelene (Sally) Martin, owned the bed and breakfast guest house called Seascape. The Martins had bought the bed and breakfast that Bryant's father had wanted to buy, and his father had complained to him on numerous occasions of the damage done to Bryant's family because of that purchase. Bryant apparently believed the Martins had deliberately bought the property to hurt his family and blamed the Martins for the depression that led to his father's death. He fatally shot them in that guest house before travelling to the Port Arthur ruins. Bryant entered The Broad Arrow Caf√© on the historical site's grounds, carrying a large blue duffel bag. Once he finished eating, Bryant moved toward the back of the caf√© and set a video camera on a vacant table. He took out a Colt AR-15 SP1 Carbine (semi-automatic rifle) and, firing from the hip, began shooting patrons and staff. Within 15 seconds, he had fired 17 shots, killing 12 people and wounding 10. Bryant then walked to the other side of the shop and fired 12 more times, killing another eight people while wounding two. He then changed magazines before fleeing, shooting at people in the car park and from his yellow Volvo 244 car as he drove away; four were killed and an additional six were injured. Bryant drove 300 metres down the road, to where a woman and her two children were walking. He stopped and fired two shots, killing the woman and the child she was carrying. The older child fled, but Bryant followed her and killed her with a single shot. He then stole a gold BMW by killing all four of its occupants. A short distance down the road, he stopped beside a couple in a white Toyota and, drawing his weapon, ordered the male occupant into the boot of the BMW. After shutting the boot, he fired two shots into the windscreen of the Toyota, killing the female driver. He returned to the guesthouse, set the stolen car alight and took his hostage inside where he had left the Martins' corpses. The police soon arrived and tried to negotiate with Bryant for many hours before the battery in the phone he was using ran out, ending communication. Bryant's only demand was to be transported in an army helicopter to an airport. During the negotiations, Bryant killed his hostage. The next morning, 18 hours later, Bryant set fire to the guesthouse and attempted to escape in the confusion.https://www.britannica.com/event/Port-Arthur-Massacre Suffering burns to his back and buttocks, he was captured and taken to Royal Hobart Hospital, where he was treated and kept under heavy guard. A panorama of the Port Arthur historic site =Imprisonment= Bryant was judged fit to stand trial, and it was scheduled to begin on 7 November 1996. Bryant initially pleaded not guilty, but was persuaded by his court-appointed lawyer, John Avery, and the prosecution to plead guilty to all charges. Two weeks later, Hobart Supreme Court Judge William Cox gave Bryant 35 life sentences, plus 1,652 years in prison, without the possibility of parole, all of which is to be served concurrently; this life sentence being applied is \\"for the term of [his] natural life.\\" For the first eight months of his imprisonment, he was held in a purpose-built special suicide-prevention cell in almost complete solitary confinement. He remained in protective custody for his own safety until he was moved to a newly built detention centre 10 years after his conviction. On 13 November 2006, Bryant was moved into Hobart's Wilfred Lopes Centre,Robert Wainwright & Paola Totaro, Born or Bred?, Chapter 33 ‚Äì Behind Bars, p. 267 a secure mental health unit run by the Tasmanian Department of Health and Human Services. The 35-bed unit for inmates with serious mental illness is staffed with doctors, nurses and other support workers. Inmates are not locked down, and can come and go from their cells. Exterior security at the facility is provided by a three-wall perimeter patrolled by private contract guards. On 25 March 2007, Bryant attempted to end his life by slashing his wrist with a razor blade. On 27 March, he cut his throat with another razor blade and was hospitalised briefly.Razor blade used in second Bryant suicide attempt ABC News 27 March 2007 As of 2020, Bryant is housed in the maximum-security Risdon Prison near Hobart. =Media coverage= Newspaper coverage immediately after the massacre raised serious questions about journalistic practices, and criticism was directed toward Australian media. Photographs of Bryant had his eyes digitally manipulated with the effect of making him appear deranged and \\"glaring\\". Despite criticism, the manipulated photographs continued to be used in media reporting a decade later. There were also questions as to how the photos had been obtained. The Tasmanian director of public prosecutions warned the media that the reporting compromised a fair trial and writs were issued against the Hobart Mercury (which used Bryant's picture under the headline \\"This is the man\\"), The Australian, The Age and the ABC over their coverage. The chairman of the Australian Press Council at the time, David Flint, argued that because Australian newspapers regularly ignored contempt-of-court provisions, this showed that the law, not the newspapers, needed change. Flint suggested that such a change in the law would not necessarily lead to trial by media. Australian newspapers also came under critical scrutiny of their accounts of Bryant and how the kind of identity responsible for his and other similar kinds of killing might be understood.Rapley, M., McCarthy, D., and McHoul, A. (2003), British Journal of Social Psychology, Br J Soc Psychol. 2003 Sep;42(Pt 3), pp.427-44. = Political aftermath = As a response to the spree killing, Australian state and territory governments placed extensive restrictions on all firearms, including semi-automatic centre-fire rifles, repeating shotguns (holding more than 5 shots) and high-capacity rifle magazines. In addition to this, limitations were also put into place on low-capacity repeating shotguns and rim-fire semi-automatic rifles. Though this resulted in stirring controversy, opposition to the new laws was overcome by media reporting of the massacre and mounting public opinion in the wake of the shootings (see Gun laws in Australia for more information on the 1996 legislation). In popular culture Wikileaks posted the entirety of the original police interview transcript. In March 2012, Sydney artist Rodney Pople controversially won the $35,000 Glover Prize for his landscape painting depicting Port Arthur with Bryant in the foreground holding a firearm.

History=Organisation= The initial supreme commander of the theatre was General Sir Archibald Wavell while head of the short-lived American- British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM) which was dissolved after the fall of Singapore and the Dutch East Indies. Afterwards, Allied forces in the region were divided between SEAC and the South West Pacific Area command (SWPA). In August 1943, the Allies created the combined South East Asian Command, to assume overall strategic command of all air, sea and land operations of all national contingents in the theatre. In August 1943, with the agreement of the Combined Chiefs of Staff, Winston Churchill appointed Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten as Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia. US Army General Joseph Stilwell was appointed deputy supreme commander. Stilwell was also, officially, deputy to Chiang Kai Shek, as Allied commander in China, and commanded all US forces across both theatres (which were known in the US as the China Burma India (CBI) Theater). Mountbatten arrived in India on 7 October and SEAC came formally into being in Delhi at midnight on 15/16 November. SEAC headquarters moved in April 1944 to Kandy in Ceylon. =General strategy= From the outset, Western Allied forces available for the wider war against Japan were limited ‚Äì by an overall Allied commitment towards defeating Nazi Germany, before the Empire of Japan. This was especially the case for the UK, and major advances were not anticipated in Asia until mid-late 1944 at least ‚Äì that is, not until the defeat of Germany had become inevitable. A strategic focus by the Western Allies on the Central Pacific (i.e. the \\"Pacific Ocean Areas\\" in contemporaneous Allied terminology) and the South- West Pacific, resulted from compromises reached at the Casablanca Conference. UK participants were focused on Nazi Germany, and saw the war against Japan being limited \\"to the defense of a fixed line in front of those positions that must be held\\". However, because such an approach was unacceptable to the United States, it was agreed that there would be offensive actions in Burma, operations in support of China, and other activity beyond holding a defensive line in South East Asia, as a result of US demands that the Japanese be kept off-balance, throughout any areas in which they might encounter Allied forces. Nevertheless, for the Western Allies, the South East Asia theatre, China, and the North Pacific (including Alaska), were destined to become secondary theatres, relative to efforts in the Pacific Ocean Areas, in which the supreme commander was US Admiral Chester Nimitz. On 2 December 1943, the Combined Chiefs of Staff officially approved in principle a plan designating the Pacific Ocean Areas as the focus of the main effort against Japan. Their reasoning was that advances in the Central Pacific were the most rapid route towards sustained, direct attacks on the Japanese Home Islands ‚Äì e.g. subjecting Tokyo and other major cities to attacks by strategic bombers. A secondary line of advance ‚Äì by US and Australian forces ‚Äì \\"along the New Guinea-N.E.I.-Philippine axis\\", was to be controlled by the separate South West Pacific Area command under Douglas MacArthur (US Army). Description The initial land forces operational area for SEAC was India, Burma, Ceylon, Malaya, northern islands of Sumatra, and, for offensive operations, Siam (Thailand). On 15 August 1945 (VJ-Day) this was expanded to include the rest parts of Dutch East Indies and southern part of French Indochina. Lieutenant- General Montagu Stopford, the second and final commander of SEAC, who commanded June‚ÄìNovember 1946. Command arrangements in SEAC were always complicated. Ideally there should have been under the Supreme Commander a Commander in Chief for each of the land sea and air forces. This was implemented for the naval and air forces (including the establishment of Air Command, South East Asia) but the British 11th Army Group, under SEAC itself, controlled only British land forces. US and Chinese forces serving in the South East Asian theatre, organised as the Northern Combat Area Command or NCAC commanded by Stilwell, answered directly to the Supreme Commander because Stilwell refused to serve under the 11th Army Group commander George Giffard. The Eleventh Army Group had the Fourteenth Army on the Burma front, and the British garrison in Ceylon under its direct command. Stilwell also served as Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-shek, who was officially the Supreme Allied Commander in China. Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Peirse was appointed the Air Commander in Chief under Mountbatten. Air units taking part in the Burma Campaign were, at first, part of either the RAF Third Tactical Air Force or the USAAF Tenth Air Force. Tenth Air Force came under SEAC only through Stilwell as commanding General CBI Theater. To avoid a potentially cumbersome chain of command and overlapping effort Mountbatten gave orders in December for the two air forces to be integrated under the name Eastern Air Command. The US Fourteenth Air Force, which was based in China and the US Twentieth Air Force ‚Äì strategic bomber units based in India ‚Äì were never controlled by SEAC but their operations were coordinated with SEAC. At sea, the command structure was relatively simple, since the Royal Navy was providing almost all naval forces in the area. Admiral Sir James Somerville, Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Fleet, became the naval commander under Mountbatten. Lord Louis Mountbatten Supreme Allied Commander of the South East Asia Command from October 1943 through the disbandment of SEAC in 1946. This photograph, taken in February 1944, is from his tour of the Arakan front, as part of the Burma Campaign It was not until late 1944 that the land forces chain of command was clarified, after Stilwell was recalled to Washington. His overall role, and the CBI command were then split among three people: Lt Gen. Raymond Wheeler became Deputy Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia; Maj. Gen. Albert Wedemeyer became Chief of Staff to Chiang, and commander of US Forces, China Theater (USFCT). Lt Gen. Daniel Sultan was promoted, from deputy commander of CBI to commander of US Forces, India-Burma Theater (USFIBT) and commander of the NCAC. The 11th Army Group was redesignated Allied Land Forces South East Asia (ALFSEA) under a new commander Lieutenant-General Oliver Leese who had relinquished command of the Eighth Army in Italy, and NCAC (which by this time included Chinese, American and British units) was placed under ALFSEA. As the drive to liberate Burma began in earnest however, Chiang Kai-shek and Wedemeyer made increasing demands for NCAC's formations to be moved to the China Theatre to meet the threat of Japanese attacks from the north. Once the Burma Road from Mandalay to Chungking was secured NCAC became passive and in March 1945 Mountbatten agreed to the US and Chinese troops in NCAC being gradually withdrawn to the China. RAF aircraft destined for SEAC had the word \\"SNAKE\\" applied after the serial during ferrying to prevent them being appropriated by other commands along the route. In February 1945 Air Marshal Keith Park was appointed Allied Air Commander of South-East Asia Command [SEAC] where he served until the end of the war. Once most of Burma was re- captured by Fourteenth Army, the command turned its attention towards its next major operational objective: Malaya. However, the use of atomic bombs on the Japanese mainland brought the war to an abrupt end. Post‚ÄìWorld War II General Joseph Stilwell (right), First Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of the South East Asia Command, together with General Frank Merrill, in Burma during the Burma Campaign. The command shifted its emphasis from combat operations to military government, and the repatriation of internees and prisoners of war. The borders of SEAC were adjusted in the aftermath of the war. French Indochina was added, along with Borneo ‚Äì most of which had already been captured by Australian forces, under the South West Pacific Command ‚Äì and Java. This added immensely to the problems of the command. Western governments expected SEAC to re-establish colonial regimes in territories lost to Japan in 1941‚Äì45, and in which anti-colonial, nationalist forces had gained strength. British Commonwealth troops were landed in the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) and Indochina to facilitate the return of forces from the pre-war colonial powers. The force landed in the East Indies was the Indian XV Corps, which included 5th Indian Infantry Division, 23rd Indian Infantry Division and 5th Parachute Brigade.Graham Watson, Allied Land Forces South East Asia 1945 , Orbat.com, accessed November 2008 Military government was soon established in Burma, Malaya, Singapore and British Borneo. Sarawak and Sumatra did not prove to be major headaches for the British, except that one Japanese unit in Borneo refused to surrender until November 1945. Thailand, although it had officially been an ally of Japan, quickly resumed both its independence and its ties with the western powers. Because of shortages of personnel, some use was made of Japanese Surrendered Personnel (JSP) in these areas. The Allies found that their war-time allies in the Viet Minh in Indochina, and Indonesian nationalist forces in the East Indies, were well armed, well-organised and determined. It was intended that British forces would temporarily enforce military government over a small section of Indochina, because of local resistance, logistics and French sensibilities. However, in the end the commander of British forces declared de facto military government, to make it possible for French forces to return. =Indonesian National Revolution, 1945‚Äì46= Aided by armed militias formed by the Japanese during the occupation, Indonesian nationalists in Java declared the Dutch East Indies a republic, and independent from the Netherlands. The British intended that the Dutch colonial administration should return, and assisted a small military contingent, the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA). However they initially avoided significant conflict with the nationalists. It was only possible for British forces to establish military government in parts of Indonesia, and they found that the location of Allied prisoners of war ‚Äì and civilians interned by Japanese forces ‚Äì were sometimes used by nationalists in bargaining for political ends. British troops found themselves in increasing conflict with the nationalists. The nationalists attacked JSP garrisons awaiting repatriation, to seize their arms. A British Brigadier, A. W. S. Mallaby, was killed, as he pushed for the nationalists to surrender their weapons. As a result, on 10 November 1945, Surabaya was attacked by British forces, leading to the bloody Battle of Surabaya. The city was secured later that month. The battle for Surabaya was the bloodiest single engagement of the Indonesian National Revolution (1945‚Äì49). However, the British were reluctant to devote their scarce resources to a defence of Dutch interests, and withdrew from Indonesia. Disbandment As 1946 drew on, under its second and final commander, Lieutenant-General Montagu Stopford (June to November 1946), SEAC discharged its final tasks and was disbanded. It was no longer felt that a joint command was needed in the area.

Born on Hester Street on Manhattan's Lower East Side, Marcus was bright and athletic. He attended Boys' High School, in Brooklyn, and was then accepted at West Point in 1920 and graduated with the class of 1924. After completing his active duty requirement, he attended Brooklyn Law School. He spent most of the 1930s as an Assistant United States Attorney in New York, prosecuting gangsters such as Lucky Luciano. In 1940, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia named Marcus Commissioner of the New York City Department of Correction for the City of New York. World War II After leaving active duty, Marcus had continued his army service in the Organized Reserve Corps. In 1939, he joined the Judge Advocate General's Corps, and became Judge Advocate of his Army National Guard unit, the 27th Infantry Division, which was federalized in 1940. Though as a legal officer, he was not supposed to command troops, he wrangled a unit command during the 1941 Louisiana Maneuvers.David 'Mickey' Marcus History magazine, June 2006. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the 27th Division deployed to Hawaii. There, Marcus organized and commanded a Ranger Combat Training School, to provide troop training in techniques of unarmed defense to combat Japanese infiltration tactics.http://www.garrison.hawaii.army.mil/sustainability/Documents/CulturalResources/HistoricContextFromAppB.pdf But instead of a field command, Marcus was sent to Washington in 1943. He was assigned to the Civil Affairs Division, as chief of planning for occupation governments in territories liberated from the Axis. He accompanied U.S. delegations to the conferences at Cairo, Teheran, Yalta, and Potsdam, and helped draw up the 1943 surrender terms for Italy. In May 1944, Marcus got himself sent to Britain on Civil Affairs business. He then traded on being a West Point classmate of General Maxwell Taylor to parachute into Normandy on D-Day with the first wave of Taylor's 101st Airborne Division, despite having no paratrooper training. He took informal command of some of the scattered paratroopers and was in combat for a week. He was then sent back to the U.S. After V-E Day in 1945, General Lucius D. Clay asked for Marcus to serve on his staff in the occupation of Germany. Marcus was in charge of providing for the millions of displaced persons in Germany. Clay required all his subordinates to tour the Dachau concentration camp. Marcus was shocked by its horrors; though not previously a Zionist, he began to think differently about a Jewish state. In 1946, he was named chief of the army's War Crimes Division in Washington, planning legal and security procedures for the Nuremberg trials and the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal. He attended the Nuremberg trials, making sure that Nazi crimes were thoroughly documented. After the trials, he was offered promotion to brigadier general, but instead elected to return to civilian life and his law practice. In recognition of his service in \\"negotiation and drafting of the Italian Surrender Instrument, the Instrument of Unconditional Surrender of Germany, and the international machinery to be used for the control of Germany after her total defeat\\" he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. in 1946 he was made an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire, ‚Äòin recognition of the distinguished service performed‚Ä¶in cooperation with British armed forces during the war.\\" He also was awarded the Bronze Star and other citiations. Israeli military career US Col. Mickey Marcus in 1948, the first modern Israeli general (Aluf). In 1947, David Ben-Gurion asked Marcus to recruit an American officer to serve as military advisor to the nascent Jewish army, the Haganah. He could not recruit anyone suitable, so Marcus volunteered himself. In 1948, the National Military Establishment informally acquiesced to Marcus' undertaking, provided he disguised his name and rank to avoid problems with the British authorities in Mandatory Palestine. Under the nom de guerre \\"Michael Stone\\", he arrived in Palestine in January 1948. Arab armies surrounded the soon-to-be declared State of Israel. He designed a command and control structure for the Haganah, adapting his U.S. Army experience to its special needs. He identified Israel's weakest points in the Negev south, and the Jerusalem area. Marcus was appointed Aluf (\\"general\\") and given command of the Jerusalem front on May 28, 1948. As no ranks were granted to Israeli high command at that time, he became the first general in the fledgling nation's army (see Israel Defense Forces). (Aluf was then equivalent to brigadier general but since 1967, Aluf is equivalent to major general.)David \\"Mickey\\" Marcus He participated in planning Operation Bin Nun Bet and Operation Yoram against the Latrun fort held by the Arab Legion, which blocked the road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which was under siege. Both attacks failed, but Marcus then built the \\"Burma Road to Jerusalem\\" ‚Äì a makeshift winding road through difficult hill terrain, nicknamed after the World War II supply route to China. His \\"Burma Road\\" was opened to vehicles on June 10, breaking the siege of Jerusalem, a day before a United Nations cease fire took effect on June 11. Death Memorial Plaque for Colonel David Marcus at Union Temple of Brooklyn A few hours before the cease fire, Marcus returned to his Central Front headquarters. He and his commanders were billeted in the monks' quarters of the abandoned Monastere Notre Dame de la Nouvelle Alliance in Abu Ghosh. Shortly before 4:00 a.m., a sentry, Eliezer Linski, eighteen years old, and a one-year Palmach veteran, challenged Marcus, who he saw as a figure in white. When Marcus failed to respond with the password, Linski fired in the air and the man ran towards the monastery. He fired at the man, as did one or more fighters in a nearby sentry post. Marcus was found dead, wrapped in a white blanket. Marcus knew very little Hebrew and had responded in English, which Linski did not understand.; Mickey Marcus Marcus wore no rank, although officers had been recognized by a ribbon pinned to their uniforms. As Marcus's body was removed from Abu Ghosh, a ribbon was found and placed on his casket. His body was returned to the United States for burial at West Point, accompanied by Moshe Dayan and his wife Ruth, Yoseph Harel, and the wife of his aide de camp, Alex Broida.Shabtai Zeveth, Moshe Dayan, The Soldier, The Man, The Legend, 149 (1972). His burial, with military honors, was attended by Gov. Thomas Dewey, former Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, and General Maxwell Taylor, then superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Ben-Gurion was suspicious of the initial report that Marcus had been shot accidentally. The Haganah was composed of several factions whose lack of consensus over strategy and tactics was one of the reasons for Marcus's appointment as commander for Jerusalem, and Ben-Gurion suspected that elements in the Palmach may have conspired to kill Marcus so he would be replaced. On the same day Marcus was shot, Ben- Gurion summoned Yaakov Shimshon Shapira‚Äîlater Israel's Attorney General‚Äîand asked him to investigate the incident. Shapira's investigation was cursory. Despite conflicting reports concerning the number of shots fired, how many wounds Marcus suffered, whether the fatal wound could have been caused by Linski's rifle, and how and why Marcus may have been outside the monastery, he concluded that Linski shot Marcus in the line of duty. The report has never been made public.. Kurzman relates that he obtained access to the report in Zahal archives \\"only after the greatest difficulty.\\" Legacy Marcus' grave is the only one in the West Point Cemetery at the United States Military Academy for an American killed fighting under the flag of another country; he was still eligible for interment there because he was a graduate of the academy who served honorably. His gravestone at West Point reads: :\\"Colonel David Marcus‚Äîa Soldier for All Humanity\\".photograph 3 of 3, in \\"IDF officers participate in Taglit-Birthright Israel visit to West Point,\\" by Michelle Schneider, September 18, 2019, Army Public Affairs Office, United States Army, retrieved May 2, 2020 A memorial plaque in his honor is located in the lobby of the Union Temple of Brooklyn where his funeral service was conducted.

On May 10, 1951, Ben-Gurion laid a wreath at the Marcus grave, accompanied by Emma Marcus. In January 2015 Israel's President, Reuven Rivlin, visited the United States Military Academy at West Point and spoke at Marcus' grave: :\\"For me, he was the first general of the IDF in every sense of the word.

It is found from the Indian subcontinent to southeast Asia. Taxonomy and systematics The black-crested bulbul was originally described in the genus Vanga and later moved to genus Pycnonotus. Pycnonotus was found to be polyphyletic in recent molecular phylogenetic studies and five bulbul species, including the black-crested bulbul, moved to Rubigula. Until 2008, the black-crested bulbul was considered as conspecific with the black-capped, ruby-throated, flame-throated and Bornean bulbuls. =Subspecies= Eight subspecies are recognized: * Black-crested yellow bulbul (P. f. flaviventris) - (Tickell, 1833): Found from Nepal, northern and eastern India (including Pachmarhi in central India) to southern China and central Myanmar * P. f. vantynei - Deignan, 1948: Found from eastern and southern Myanmar to southern China and northern Indochina * P. f. xanthops - Deignan, 1948: Found in south-eastern Myanmar and western Thailand * P. f. auratus - Deignan, 1948: Found in north-eastern Thailand and western Laos * P. f. johnsoni - (Gyldenstolpe, 1913): Originally described as a separate species. Found in central and eastern Thailand, southern Indochina * P. f. elbeli - Deignan, 1954: Found on islands off eastern coast of Thailand * P. f. negatus - Deignan, 1954: Found in southern Myanmar and south-western Thailand * P. f. caecilii - Deignan, 1948: Found on the northern Malay Peninsula Kaeng Krachan Nat‚Äôl Park - Thailand Black-crested Bulbul Description  The black- crested bulbul is generally about 19 cm in length. As the name suggests, the head of this bulbul is black while the rest of its body is different shades of yellow. Both the male and female are similar in plumage. One can make out a younger bird by its slightly duller coloring. Distribution and habitat This is a bird of forest and dense scrub. Behaviour and ecology It builds its nest in a bush; two to four eggs is a typical clutch. The black-crested bulbul feeds on fruit and insects.

October 28, 2005. \\"Esthero, Mixing It Up Again\\". The Washington Post. is a Canadian singer-songwriter who lives in Los Angeles, California. The name Esthero refers both to the singer and formerly to the two-person team of herself and producer Doc McKinney. Esthero is a portmanteau of \\"Esther the hero\\"; she claims to have gotten the name by combining the name of the heroine (Esther) and last line (\\"If I am to be the hero, then I cannot fly from darkness\\") of the movie from Sylvia Plath's novel, The Bell Jar. Esthero's sound characteristically features her voice over a mix of mellow bass lines, jazzy trumpets, Spanish guitar and hip-hop. She is sometimes compared to artists Bj√∂rk, Portishead, Billie Holiday, and Sade. She has co- produced the majority of the material she performed. Later female artists who count Esthero among their influences include Res, Fergie and fellow Canadian Nelly Furtado. Esthero's brother, Jason Englishman, is also a musician. Career=Early life= At the age of sixteen, Esthero moved from the small town of Walkerton, Ontario on her own to Toronto, Ontario, where she began singing at open-mic nights while supporting herself by working at various jobs: Future Bakery, the printing house, and telemarketing. She was seen singing at the Free Times Cafe by manager Beau Ovcaric who set up a showcase for his partner Zack Werner. The two managed her on good faith without any legal paperwork until she turned eighteen. They introduced her to EMI Publishing Canada president Michael McCarty, whom she charmed so well during their first meeting that without hearing her sing a single note he set up and paid for recording sessions with Martin \\"Doc\\" McKinney, a guitarist and studio engineer whom she had met through a mutual friend. =1997: Breath from Another= The young duo quickly began recording together, and 6 demos in were being courted on the presidency level by almost every major label in the US. Thanks to then EMI publishing US president Rick Krim their demo's reached the ears of the heads of the Work Group (a subsidiary of Sony). Their debut album, Breath from Another, was released to critical acclaim in Spring 1998. =1998‚Äì2003: Collaborations and success= Following lukewarm sales of her debut, Esthero was dropped from her record label. In 1998, after a remix of one of her songs (\\"Country Livin'\\") was used included on the soundtrack for \\"Slam\\", Esthero received attention from many hip-hop and rap artists, with many requesting collaborations with her. Some such collaborations were fruitful, such as her work with the Black Eyed Peas on \\"Weekends\\", which was an international hit. Esthero performed at Lee's Palace in Toronto in March 1999.\\"Live Reviews: Esthero March 6, 1999 Lee's Palace, Toronto, ON\\". Chart Attack, by Jim kelly In 2001, Esthero collaborated with German producer Ian Pooley on \\"Balmes (A Better Life)\\", which reached the Top 75 of the UK Singles chart and gave Esthero her first entry on the US Dance charts. =2004‚Äì2005: O.G. Bitch and Wikked Lil Grrrls= On April 20, 2004‚Äîwithout Doc's assistance‚ÄîEsthero released O.G. Bitch, a standalone EP featuring six different remixes of the title track, plus the B-side \\"I Love You\\". The song topped the club charts in the US. The following year, she released a second EP, titled We R in Need of a Musical Revolution. The EP spawned a hit of the same name and led the way to Esthero's 2005 full-length album on the Warner Bros. label, Wikked Lil' Grrrls, seven years following her debut album, to mixed critical reaction. The album features contributions from Sean Lennon, Andr√© 3000, Jemeni, Jelleestone, and Cee-Lo Green of Goodie Mob. =2007‚Äì2011: Split from record company and collaborations= In 2007, Esthero amicably parted ways with Venus Management. She continues to have a familial bond with Zack and Beau. Esthero is currently self managed. 2008 was an eventful year for Esthero, with a number of high-profile collaborations including the viral sensation Yes We Can, a song (with accompanying video) inspired by a speech delivered by Barack Obama and produced by will.i.am. Esthero also provided the voice of the spaceship J.A.N.E. on Kanye West's Glow in the Dark tour and appeared on his album 808s & Heartbreak, on which she co-wrote three tracks under her real name. 2008 also saw her take on the role of producer for a track from Dangerous Muse's debut album and a co-writer on Brandy's album \\"Human\\". She is featured on hip hop music producer Timbaland's 2009 album Shock Value II on the songs \\"Can You Feel It\\" and \\"Undertow\\" with band The Fray. The latter entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 100, giving Esthero her first and only Hot 100 entry in the US. =2012‚Äìpresent: Everything Is Expensive and \\"Baby Steps\\"= On June 5, 2012, Esthero released a new single titled \\"Never Gonna Let You Go\\", which was co-written and co-produced with Adam Bravin (She Wants Revenge). The song was featured in the February 21, 2013 episode of Grey's Anatomy, titled \\"This Is Why We Fight\\". The song reached number 72 on the Canadian Hot 100, giving Esthero her first entry on the chart. On October 30, 2012, Esthero self-released a new album titled Everything Is Expensive. It debuted at number 13 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart in the US. In Canada, the album was released through Universal Music. In 2016, \\"Breath from Another\\" was nominated for a Polaris Heritage Prize, for best album from 1996 to 2005. The album lost, however, to Arcade Fire's \\"Funeral\\" (which won the public vote) and Lhasa de Sela's \\"La Llorona\\" (which won the jury vote). In 2019, Esthero was featured in Black Eyed Peas song \\"4ever\\", and was in the accompanying music video which was published on February 1, 2019. Via social media, Esthero announced the song \\"Baby Steps\\" on February 3, 2019. Chart history Esthero's singles typically perform well in North America. She has had three songs enter the American Dance Club Songs chart (\\"Balmes\\", with Ian Pooley; \\"O.G. Bitch\\"; and \\"Fastlane\\", with Jemeni & Jelleestone); two of the songs reached the Top 5 of the chart and one, \\"O.G. Bitch\\", reached number 1. She has also had two entries on the American Dance Singles Sales chart (\\"O.G. Bitch\\" and \\"Fastlane\\"), both of which reached the Top 10. She has had one chart entry in the UK (\\"Balmes\\", which broke the Top 75), and one chart entry in her native Canada (\\"Never Gonna Let You Go\\", which reached number 72 on their Hot 100 chart). Appearances on TV and soundtracks Esthero has appeared on the Chris Rock Show, Video on Trial, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, as well as Late Night with Conan O'Brien and Farmclub with The Black Eyed Peas.

William Calvin Oates (either November 30 or December 1, 1835September 9, 1910) was a colonel in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War, the 29th Governor of Alabama from 1894 to 1896, and a brigadier general in the U.S. Army during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Early life Oates was born in Pike County, Alabama, to William and Sarah (Sellers) Oates, a poor farming family. At the age of 17, he believed that he had killed a man in a violent brawl and left home for Florida. Oates became a drifter, settling in Texas for a couple of years before returning to Alabama at the urging of his younger brother John, who had been dispatched by the family to locate him. He studied law at the Lawrenceville Academy in Lawrenceville and passed the bar examination, and then opened a practice in Abbeville. Civil War William C. Oates joined the Confederate States Army in July, 1861 and entered the army as Captain, 15th Alabama Infantry Regiment and eventually became the commander of the 15th Alabama infantry regiment in the spring of 1863. He fought in the Battle of Gettysburg, leading his troops in a series of charges on Little Round Top, where his brother John perished. This became one of Oates's significant memories of the war, as he believed that if his regiment had been able to take Little Round Top, the Army of Northern Virginia might have won the battle, and possibly marched on to take Washington, D.C. Oates later stated that if even a single additional Confederate regiment had joined the assault, the attack could have succeeded, turning the Union's flank and threatening the entire Army of the Potomac.LaFantasie, np.Oates, William C. The War Between the Union and the Confederacy and Its Lost Opportunities. Dayton, OH: Morningside Bookshop, 1974. . First published 1905 by Neale Publishing Co. pp. 216, 219. Oates stated: Oates participated in the battles of Chickamauga, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, and Cold Harbor. After transferring to the 48th Alabama, he was wounded near Petersburg, Virginia, losing his right arm, which ended his active service. Postbellum career Oates resumed his law practice in Henry County, Alabama, and served as a delegate to the 1868 Democratic National Convention. From 1870 to 1872, he was a member of the Alabama House of Representatives. In 1880, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served seven consecutive terms. Oates married Sarah Toney of Eufaula on March 28, 1882, and they had one son, William Calvin, Jr., who eventually joined his father in the law practice. Oates was elected governor of Alabama in 1894 in a bitter campaign. Two years later, he unsuccessfully tried to secure his party's nomination as a candidate for the United States Senate. President William McKinley commissioned Oates as a brigadier general in 1898 and he served in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. He returned to his law practice and speculated in real estate. He tried unsuccessfully to have a monument erected at Gettysburg to his comrades in the old 15th Alabama, including his fallen brother. Oates died in Montgomery, and is buried there in Oakwood Cemetery. NotesReferences * LaFantasie, Glenn W. \\"The Inimitable William C. Oates.\\" National Park Service website, accessed 10/26/07.

Autophagy (or autophagocytosis) (from the Ancient Greek aut√≥phagos, meaning \\"self-devouring\\" and k√Ωtos, meaning \\"hollow\\") is the natural, regulated mechanism of the cell that removes unnecessary or dysfunctional components. It allows the orderly degradation and recycling of cellular components. Although initially characterised as a primordial degradation pathway induced to protect against starvation, it has become increasingly clear that autophagy also plays a major role in the homeostasis of non-starved cells. Defects in autophagy have been linked to various human diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer, and interest in modulating autophagy as a potential treatment for these diseases has grown rapidly. Three forms of autophagy are commonly described: macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). In macroautophagy, cytoplasmic components (like mitochondria) are targeted and isolated from the rest of the cell within a double-membraned vesicle known as an autophagosome, which, in time, fuses with an available lysosome, bringing its specialty process of waste management and disposal; and eventually the contents of the vesicle (now called an autolysosome) are degraded and recycled. In disease, autophagy has been seen as an adaptive response to stress, promoting survival of the cell; but in other cases it appears to promote cell death and morbidity. In the extreme case of starvation, the breakdown of cellular components promotes cellular survival by maintaining cellular energy levels. The word \\"autophagy\\" was in existence and frequently used from the middle of the 19th century. In its present usage, the term autophagy was coined by Belgian biochemist Christian de Duve in 1963 based on his discovery of the functions of lysosome. The identification of autophagy- related genes in yeast in the 1990s allowed researchers to deduce the mechanisms of autophagy, which eventually led to the award of the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Japanese researcher Yoshinori Ohsumi. History Autophagy was first observed by Keith R. Porter and his student Thomas Ashford at the Rockefeller Institute. In January 1962 they reported an increased number of lysosomes in rat liver cells after the addition of glucagon, and that some displaced lysosomes towards the centre of the cell contained other cell organelles such as mitochondria. They called this autolysis after Christian de Duve and Alex B. Novikoff. However Porter and Ashford wrongly interpreted their data as lysosome formation (ignoring the pre-existing organelles). Lysosomes could not be cell organelles, but part of cytoplasm such as mitochondria, and that hydrolytic enzymes were produced by microbodies. In 1963 Hruban, Spargo and colleagues published a detailed ultrastructural description of \\"focal cytoplasmic degradation,\\" which referenced a 1955 German study of injury-induced sequestration. Hruban, Spargo and colleagues recognized three continuous stages of maturation of the sequestered cytoplasm to lysosomes, and that the process was not limited to injury states that functioned under physiological conditions for \\"reutilization of cellular materials,\\" and the \\"disposal of organelles\\" during differentiation. Inspired by this discovery, de Duve christened the phenomena \\"autophagy\\". Unlike Porter and Ashford, de Duve conceived the term as a part of lysosomal function while describing the role of glucagon as a major inducer of cell degradation in the liver. With his student Russell Deter, he established that lysosomes are responsible for glucagon-induced autophagy. This was the first time the fact that lysosomes are the sites of intracellular autophagy was established. In the 1990s several groups of scientists independently discovered autophagy-related genes using the budding yeast. Notably, Yoshinori Ohsumi and Michael Thumm examined starvation-induced non- selective autophagy; in the meantime, Daniel J Klionsky discovered the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (CVT) pathway, which is a form of selective autophagy. They soon found that they were in fact looking at essentially the same pathway, just from different angles. Initially, the genes discovered by these and other yeast groups were given different names (APG, AUT, CVT, GSA, PAG, PAZ, and PDD). A unified nomenclature was advocated in 2003 by the yeast researchers to use ATG to denote autophagy genes. The 2016 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Yoshinori Ohsumi, although some have pointed out that the award could have been more inclusive. The field of autophagy research experienced accelerated growth at the turn of the 21st century. Knowledge of ATG genes provided scientists more convenient tools to dissect functions of autophagy in human health and disease. In 1999, a landmark discovery connecting autophagy with cancer was published by Beth Levine's group. To this date, relationship between cancer and autophagy continues to be a main theme of autophagy research. The roles of autophagy in neurodegeneration and immune defense also received considerable attention. In 2003, the first Gordon Research Conference on autophagy was held at Waterville. In 2005, Daniel J Klionsky launched Autophagy, a scientific journal dedicated to this field. The first Keystone Symposia Conference on autophagy was held in 2007 at Monterey. In 2008, Carol A Mercer created a BHMT fusion protein (GST-BHMT), which showed starvation-induced site-specific fragmentation in cell lines. The degradation of betaine homo-cysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), a metabolic enzyme, could be used to assess autophagy flux in mammalian cells. In contemporary literature, the Brazilian writer Leonid R. B√≥zio expresses autophagy as an existential question. The psychological drama of the book Tempos Sombrios B√ìZIO, Leonid. Autofagia: livro I Tempos Sombrios. Bras√≠lia: Amazon, 2018. recounts characters consuming their own lives in an inauthentic existence. Macro, micro, and Chaperone mediated autophagy are mediated by autophagy-related genes and their associated enzymes. Macroautophagy is then divided into bulk and selective autophagy. In the selective autophagy is the autophagy of organelles; mitophagy, lipophagy, pexophagy, chlorophagy, ribophagy and others. Macroautophagy is the main pathway, used primarily to eradicate damaged cell organelles or unused proteins. First the phagophore engulfs the material that needs to be degraded, which forms a double membrane known as an autophagosome, around the organelle marked for destruction. The autophagosome then travels through the cytoplasm of the cell to a lysosome, and the two organelles fuse. Within the lysosome, the contents of the autophagosome are degraded via acidic lysosomal hydrolase. Microautophagy, on the other hand, involves the direct engulfment of cytoplasmic material into the lysosome. This occurs by invagination, meaning the inward folding of the lysosomal membrane, or cellular protrusion. Chaperone-mediated autophagy, or CMA, is a very complex and specific pathway, which involves the recognition by the hsc70-containing complex. This means that a protein must contain the recognition site for this hsc70 complex which will allow it to bind to this chaperone, forming the CMA- substrate/chaperone complex. This complex then moves to the lysosomal membrane-bound protein that will recognise and bind with the CMA receptor. Upon recognition, the substrate protein gets unfolded and it is translocated across the lysosome membrane with the assistance of the lysosomal hsc70 chaperone. CMA is significantly different from other types of autophagy because it translocates protein material in a one by one manner, and it is extremely selective about what material crosses the lysosomal barrier. Mitophagy is the selective degradation of mitochondria by autophagy. It often occurs to defective mitochondria following damage or stress. Mitophagy promotes turnover of mitochondria and prevents accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria which can lead to cellular degeneration. It is mediated by Atg32 (in yeast) and NIX and its regulator BNIP3 in mammals. Mitophagy is regulated by PINK1 and parkin proteins. The occurrence of mitophagy is not limited to the damaged mitochondria but also involves undamaged ones. Lipophagy is the degradation of lipids by autophagy, a function which has been shown to exist in both animal and fungal cells. The role of lipophagy in plant cells, however, remains elusive. In lipophagy the target are lipid structures called lipid droplets (LDs), spheric \\"organelles\\" with a core of mainly triacylglycerols (TAGs) and a unilayer of phospholipids and membrane proteins. In animal cells the main lipophagic pathway is via the engulfment of LDs by the phagophore, macroautophagy. In fungal cells on the other hand microplipophagy constitutes the main pathway and is especially well studied in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Lipophagy was first discovered in mice and published 2009. Molecular biology Autophagy is executed by autophagy-related (Atg) genes. Prior to 2003, ten or more names were used, but after this point a unified nomenclature was devised by fungal autophagy researchers. Atg or ATG stands for autophagy related. It does not specify gene or a protein. The first autophagy genes were identified by genetic screens conducted in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Following their identification those genes were functionally characterized and their orthologs in a variety of different organisms were identified and studied. In mammals, amino acid sensing and additional signals such as growth factors and reactive oxygen species regulate the activity of the protein kinases mTOR and AMPK. These two kinases regulate autophagy through inhibitory phosphorylation of the Unc-51-like kinases ULK1 and ULK2 (mammalian homologues of Atg1). Induction of autophagy results in the dephosphorylation and activation of the ULK kinases. ULK is part of a protein complex containing Atg13, Atg101 and FIP200. ULK phosphorylates and activates Beclin-1 (mammalian homologue of Atg6), which is also part of a protein complex. The autophagy-inducible Beclin-1 complex contains the proteins PIK3R4(p150), Atg14L and the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase (PI(3)K) Vps34. The active ULK and Beclin-1 complexes re-localize to the site of autophagosome initiation, the phagophore, where they both contribute to the activation of downstream autophagy components. Once active, VPS34 phosphorylates the lipid phosphatidylinositol to generate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) on the surface of the phagophore. The generated PtdIns(3)P is used as a docking point for proteins harboring a PtdIns(3)P binding motif. WIPI2, a PtdIns(3)P binding protein of the WIPI (WD-repeat protein interacting with phosphoinositides) protein family, was recently shown to physically bind Atg16L1.T. Proikas-C√©zanne, Z. Takacs, P. Donnes, and O. Kohlbacher, 'Wipi Proteins: Essential Ptdins3p Effectors at the Nascent Autophagosome', J Cell Sci, 128 (2015), 207-17 Atg16L1 is a member of an E3-like protein complex involved in one of two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems essential for autophagosome formation. Its binding by WIPI2 recruits it to the phagophore and mediates its activity. The first of the two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems involved in autophagy covalently binds the ubiquitin-like protein Atg12 to Atg5. The resulting conjugate protein then binds Atg16L1 to form an E3-like complex which functions as part of the second ubiquitin-like conjugation system. This complex binds and activates Atg3, which covalently attaches mammalian homologues of the ubiquitin-like yeast protein ATG8 (LC3A-C, GATE16, and GABARAPL1-3), the most studied being LC3 proteins, to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) on the surface of autophagosomes. Lipidated LC3 contributes to the closure of autophagosomes, and enables the docking of specific cargos and adaptor proteins such as Sequestosome-1/p62. The completed autophagosome then fuses with a lysosome through the actions of multiple proteins, including SNAREs and UVRAG. Following the fusion LC3 is retained on the vesicle's inner side and degraded along with the cargo, while the LC3 molecules attached to the outer side are cleaved off by Atg4 and recycled. The contents of the autolysosome are subsequently degraded and their building blocks are released from the vesicle through the action of permeases.  Functions = Nutrient starvation = Autophagy has roles in various cellular functions. One particular example is in yeasts, where the nutrient starvation induces a high level of autophagy. This allows unneeded proteins to be degraded and the amino acids recycled for the synthesis of proteins that are essential for survival. In higher eukaryotes, autophagy is induced in response to the nutrient depletion that occurs in animals at birth after severing off the trans-placental food supply, as well as that of nutrient starved cultured cells and tissues. Mutant yeast cells that have a reduced autophagic capability rapidly perish in nutrition-deficient conditions. Studies on the apg mutants suggest that autophagy via autophagic bodies is indispensable for protein degradation in the vacuoles under starvation conditions, and that at least 15 APG genes are involved in autophagy in yeast. A gene known as ATG7 has been implicated in nutrient-mediated autophagy, as mice studies have shown that starvation-induced autophagy was impaired in atg7-deficient mice. = Xenophagy = In microbiology, xenophagy is the autophagic degradation of infectious particles. Cellular autophagic machinery also play an important role in innate immunity. Intracellular pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (the bacterium which is responsible for tuberculosis) are targeted for degradation by the same cellular machinery and regulatory mechanisms that target host mitochondria for degradation. Incidentally, this is further evidence for the endosymbiotic hypothesis. This process generally leads to the destruction of the invasive microorganism, although some bacteria can block the maturation of phagosomes into degradative organelles called phagolysosomes. Stimulation of autophagy in infected cells can help overcome this phenomenon, restoring pathogen degradation. = Infection = Vesicular stomatitis virus is believed to be taken up by the autophagosome from the cytosol and translocated to the endosomes where detection takes place by a pattern recognition receptor called toll-like receptor 7, detecting single stranded RNA. Following activation of the toll- like receptor, intracellular signaling cascades are initiated, leading to induction of interferon and other antiviral cytokines. A subset of viruses and bacteria subvert the autophagic pathway to promote their own replication. Galectin-8 has recently been identified as an intracellular \\"danger receptor\\", able to initiate autophagy against intracellular pathogens. When galectin-8 binds to a damaged vacuole, it recruits an autophagy adaptor such as NDP52 leading to the formation of an autophagosome and bacterial degradation. = Repair mechanism = Autophagy degrades damaged organelles, cell membranes and proteins, and electing against autophagy is thought to be one of the main reasons for the accumulation of damaged cells and aging. Autophagy and autophagy regulators are involved in response to lysosomal damage, often directed by galectins such as galectin-3 and galectin-8, which in turn recruit receptors such as TRIM16. and NDP52 plus directly affect mTOR and AMPK activity, whereas mTOR and AMPK inhibit and activate autophagy, respectively = Programmed cell death = One of the mechanisms of programmed cell death (PCD) is associated with the appearance of autophagosomes and depends on autophagy proteins. This form of cell death most likely corresponds to a process that has been morphologically defined as autophagic PCD. One question that constantly arises, however, is whether autophagic activity in dying cells is the cause of death or is actually an attempt to prevent it. Morphological and histochemical studies so far did not prove a causative relationship between the autophagic process and cell death. In fact, there have recently been strong arguments that autophagic activity in dying cells might actually be a survival mechanism. Studies of the metamorphosis of insects have shown cells undergoing a form of PCD that appears distinct from other forms; these have been proposed as examples of autophagic cell death. Recent pharmacological and biochemical studies have proposed that survival and lethal autophagy can be distinguished by the type and degree of regulatory signaling during stress particularly after viral infection. Although promising, these findings have not been examined in non-viral systems. Exercise Autophagy is essential for basal homeostasis; it is also extremely important in maintaining muscle homeostasis during physical exercise. Autophagy at the molecular level is only partially understood. A study of mice shows that autophagy is important for the ever-changing demands of their nutritional and energy needs, particularly through the metabolic pathways of protein catabolism. In a 2012 study conducted by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, mutant mice (with a knock-in mutation of BCL2 phosphorylation sites to produce progeny that showed normal levels of basal autophagy yet were deficient in stress-induced autophagy) were tested to challenge this theory. Results showed that when compared to a control group, these mice illustrated a decrease in endurance and an altered glucose metabolism during acute exercise. Another study demonstrated that skeletal muscle fibres of collagen VI knockout mice showed signs of degeneration due to an insufficiency of autophagy which led to an accumulation of damaged mitochondria and excessive cell death. Exercise-induced autophagy was unsuccessful however; but when autophagy was induced artificially post- exercise, the accumulation of damaged organelles in collagen VI deficient muscle fibres was prevented and cellular homeostasis was maintained. Both studies demonstrate that autophagy induction may contribute to the beneficial metabolic effects of exercise and that it is essential in the maintaining of muscle homeostasis during exercise, particularly in collagen VI fibres. Work at the Institute for Cell Biology, University of Bonn, showed that a certain type of autophagy, i.e. chaperone-assisted selective autophagy (CASA), is induced in contracting muscles and is required for maintaining the muscle sarcomere under mechanical tension. The CASA chaperone complex recognizes mechanically damaged cytoskeleton components and directs these components through a ubiquitin-dependent autophagic sorting pathway to lysosomes for disposal. This is necessary for maintaining muscle activity. Osteoarthritis Because autophagy decreases with age and age is a major risk factor for osteoarthritis, the role of autophagy in the development of this disease is suggested. Proteins involved in autophagy are reduced with age in both human and mouse articular cartilage. Mechanical injury to cartilage explants in culture also reduced autophagy proteins. Autophagy is constantly activated in normal cartilage but it is compromised with age and precedes cartilage cell death and structural damage. Thus autophagy is involved in a normal protective process (chondroprotection) in the joint. Cancer Cancer often occurs when several different pathways that regulate cell differentiation are disturbed. Autophagy plays an important role in cancer ‚Äì both in protecting against cancer as well as potentially contributing to the growth of cancer.Furuya, N., Liang, X.H., and Levin, B. 2004. Autophagy and cancer. In Autophagy. D.J. Klionsky editor. Landes Bioscience. Georgetown, Texas, USA. 244-253. Autophagy can contribute to cancer by promoting survival of tumor cells that have been starved, or that degrade apoptotic mediators through autophagy: in such cases, use of inhibitors of the late stages of autophagy (such as chloroquine), on the cells that use autophagy to survive, increases the number of cancer cells killed by antineoplastic drugs. The role of autophagy in cancer is one that has been highly researched and reviewed. There is evidence that emphasizes the role of autophagy as both a tumor suppressor and a factor in tumor cell survival. Recent research has shown, however, that autophagy is more likely to be used as a tumor suppressor according to several models. =Tumor suppressor= Several experiments have been done with mice and varying Beclin1, a protein that regulates autophagy. When the Beclin1 gene was altered to be heterozygous (Beclin 1+/-), the mice were found to be tumor prone. However, when Beclin1 was overexpressed, tumor development was inhibited. Care should be exercised when interpreting phenotypes of beclin mutants and attributing the observations to a defect in autophagy, however: Beclin1 is generally required for phosphatidylinositol 3- phosphate production and as such it affects numerous lysosomal and endosomal functions, including endocytosis and endocytic degradation of activated growth factor receptors. In support of the possibility that Beclin1 affects cancer development through an autophagy-independent pathway is the fact that core autophagy factors which are not known to affect other cellular processes and are definitely not known to affect cell proliferation and cell death, such as Atg7 or Atg5, show a much different phenotype when the respective gene is knocked out, which does not include tumor formation. In addition, full knockout of Beclin1 is embryonic lethal whereas knockout of Atg7 or Atg5 is not. Necrosis and chronic inflammation also has been shown to be limited through autophagy which helps protect against the formation of tumor cells. =Tumor cell survival= Alternatively, autophagy has also been shown to play a large role in tumor cell survival. In cancerous cells, autophagy is used as a way to deal with stress on the cell. Induction of autophagy by miRNA-4673, for example, is a pro-survival mechanism that improves the resistance of cancer cells to radiation. Once these autophagy related genes were inhibited, cell death was potentiated. The increase in metabolic energy is offset by autophagy functions. These metabolic stresses include hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and an increase in proliferation. These stresses activate autophagy in order to recycle ATP and maintain survival of the cancerous cells. Autophagy has been shown to enable continued growth of tumor cells by maintaining cellular energy production. By inhibiting autophagy genes in these tumors cells, regression of the tumor and extended survival of the organs affected by the tumors were found. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy has also been shown to enhance the effectiveness of anticancer therapies. =Mechanism of cell death= Cells that undergo an extreme amount of stress experience cell death either through apoptosis or necrosis. Prolonged autophagy activation leads to a high turnover rate of proteins and organelles. A high rate above the survival threshold may kill cancer cells with a high apoptotic threshold. This technique can be utilized as a therapeutic cancer treatment. =Therapeutic target= New developments in research have found that targeted autophagy may be a viable therapeutic solution in fighting cancer. As discussed above, autophagy plays both a role in tumor suppression and tumor cell survival. Thus, the qualities of autophagy can be used as a strategy for cancer prevention. The first strategy is to induce autophagy and enhance its tumor suppression attributes. The second strategy is to inhibit autophagy and thus induce apoptosis. The first strategy has been tested by looking at dose-response anti-tumor effects during autophagy-induced therapies. These therapies have shown that autophagy increases in a dose- dependent manner. This is directly related to the growth of cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner as well. This data supports the development of therapies that will encourage autophagy. Secondly, inhibiting the protein pathways directly known to induce autophagy may also serve as an anticancer therapy. The second strategy is based on the idea that autophagy is a protein degradation system used to maintain homeostasis and the findings that inhibition of autophagy often leads to apoptosis. Inhibition of autophagy is riskier as it may lead to cell survival instead of the desired cell death. = Negative regulators of autophagy = Negative regulators of autophagy, such as mTOR, cFLIP, and EGFR are orchestrated to function within different stages of the autophagy cascade. The end-products of autophagic digestion may also serve as a negative- feedback regulatory mechanism to stop prolonged activity. The interface between inflammation and autophagy Regulators of autophagy control regulators of inflammation, and vice versa. Cells of vertebrate organisms normally activate inflammation to enhance the capacity of the immune system to clear infections and to initiate the processes that restore tissue structure and function. Therefore, it is critical to couple regulation of mechanisms for removal of cellular and bacterial debris to the principal factors that regulate inflammation: The degradation of cellular components by the lysosome during autophagy serves to recycle vital molecules and generate a pool of building blocks to help the cell respond to a changing microenvironment. Proteins that control inflammation and autophagy form a network that is critical for tissue functions, which is dysregulated in cancer: In cancer cells, aberrantly expressed and mutant proteins increase the dependence of cell survival on the ‚Äúrewired‚Äù network of proteolytic systems that protects malignant cells from apoptotic proteins and from recognition by the immune system. This renders cancer cells vulnerable to intervention on regulators of autophagy. Parkinson disease Parkinson disease is a neurodegenerative disorder partially caused by the cell death of brain and brain stem cells in many nuclei like the substantia nigra. Parkinson's disease is characterized by inclusions of a protein called alpha-synuclien (Lewy bodies) in affected neurons that cells cannot break down. Deregulation of the autophagy pathway and mutation of alleles regulating autophagy are believed to cause neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy is essential for neuronal survival. Without efficient autophagy, neurons gather ubiquitinated protein aggregates and degrade. Ubiquitinated proteins are proteins that have been tagged with ubiquitin to get degraded. Mutations of synuclein alleles lead to lysosome pH increase and hydrolase inhibition. As a result, lysosomes degradative capacity is decreased. There are several genetic mutations implicated in the disease, including loss of function PINK1 and Parkin. Loss of function in these genes can lead to damaged mitochondrial accumulation and protein aggregates than can lead to cellular degeneration. Mitochondria is involved in Parkinson's disease. In idiopathic Parkinson's disease, the disease is commonly caused by dysfunctional mitochondria, cellular oxidative stress, autophagic alterations and the aggregation of proteins. These can lead to mitochondrial swelling and depolarization.  Significance of autophagy as a drug target  Since dysregulation of autophagy is involved in the pathogenesis of a broad range of diseases, great efforts are invested to identify and characterize small synthetic or natural molecules that can regulate it.

Senators are elected from 67 single-member districts. In order to account for decennial redistricting, members run for one two-year term and two four-year terms each decade. They are elected for four-year terms in years ending in 2 and 6, and for two-year terms in years ending in 0. Representatives are elected for two-year terms from 134 single-member districts formed by dividing the 67 senate districts in half. Both houses of the Legislature meet between January and the first Monday following the third Saturday in May each year, not to exceed 120 legislative days per biennium. Floor sessions are held in the Minnesota State Capitol in Saint Paul. History Early on in the Minnesota's history, the Legislature had direct control over the city charters that set the groundwork for governments in municipalities across the state. In the early period, many laws were written for specific cities. The practice was outlawed in 1881, though attempts were still made. For instance, the long-standing Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board and the city's now defunct Library Board were both created by the Legislature in the next several years. The Minnesota Constitution was amended in 1896 to give cities direct control over their own charters. Following the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920, women began to be elected to the Minnesota Legislature. In 1922, Mabeth Hurd Paige, Hannah Kempfer, Sue Metzger Dickey Hough and Myrtle Cain were elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives. In 1984, the Legislature ordered that all gender-specific pronouns be removed from the state laws. After two years of work, the rewritten laws were adopted. Only 301 of 20,000 pronouns were feminine. \\"His\\" was changed 10,000 times and \\"he\\" was changed 6,000 times. =The non-partisan era= In 1913, Minnesota legislators began to be elected on nonpartisan ballots. This was a historical accident that occurred when a bill to provide for no-party elections of judges, city, and county officers was amended to include the Legislature in the belief that it would kill the bill. While Minnesota legislators were elected on a nonpartisan ballot, they caucused as \\"Liberals\\" or \\"Conservatives,\\" roughly the equivalent in most years to Democratic or Farmer‚ÄìLabor (later Democratic‚ÄìFarmer‚ÄìLabor) and Republican, respectively. For example, John J. McNulty was elected to 10 consecutive 2 year terms in the Minnesota House of Representatives from 1928 to 1946 on a nonpartisan ballot, while caucusing with the \\"Liberals\\" in the House. He died in office in his 19th year as a \\"Liberal\\" causer, shortly, after being sworn-in for his 10th term. Official website of the Minnesota Legislature. In 1974, House members again ran with party designation. In 1976, Senate members again ran with party designation. =Recent history= Governor Jesse Ventura advocated the idea of changing the Legislature to be unicameral while he was in office, but the concept did not obtain widespread support. In 2004, the Legislature ended its regular session without acting on a majority of the planned legislation, largely due to political divisiveness on a variety of issues ranging from education to same-sex marriage (See same-sex marriage in the United States for related events during the year). A proper budget failed to pass, and major anticipated projects such as the Northstar Corridor commuter rail line were not approved. Governor Tim Pawlenty, an advocate of the line (formerly an opponent), was expected to request a special session, but ended up helping the coordination of other funds to continue development of the line. The lack of action in the 2004 session is said to be one reason why a number of Republican House members lost their seats in the November election. The Democratic‚ÄìFarmer‚ÄìLabor (DFL) minority grew from 53 to 66 and the Republican majority was reduced from 81 to 68. The Senate was not up for election in 2004 so the DFL was able to maintain its five-seat majority in the upper house. One state senator, Sheila Kiscaden of Rochester, was an Independence Party member until December 2005 when she began caucusing with the DFL, although she had been an elected Republican in the past. The DFL majority increased to six senators when Kiscaden announced her re-affiliation with the DFL in preparation to run for lieutenant governor on a ticket with DFLer Kelly Doran. There is a mandatory adjournment date specified in the state constitution: \\"The legislature shall not meet in regular session, nor in any adjournment thereof, after the first Monday following the third Saturday in May of any year.\\" In 2005, the regular session ended without passage of an overall budget and a special session was subsequently called by Governor Pawlenty. No overall budget passed by the end of the fiscal year on June 30, and much of the government shut down for the first time in the state's history. However, some essential services remained in operation and some departments received funding in legislation. A compromise budget was approved and signed into law two weeks later. As of 2018, it is the only state legislature under split control.https://psmag.com/news/only-one-state- legislature-is-now-under-split-party-control Television broadcasts When the Legislature is in session, proceedings of both houses are broadcast on television via the Minnesota Channel and also online via the Legislature's website.

It has a population of 9,412 people (2004). Initially founded in the 6th century, Kruszwica is the oldest town in the region and features a medieval castle with a 12th-century Romanesque church. History Ruins of the medieval castle This article incorporates text from \\"The Political History of Poland\\" (1917) by Edward Henry Lewinski-Corwin, a publication now in the public domain. Owing to the frequent raids of the Norsemen, the people of this region early organized an effective military force of defense. Under the protection of the military bands and their chiefs, the fields could safely be cultivated and the little, fortified towns (grody), which became places for the transaction of intertribal business and barter, for common worship, and for the storage of goods during a foreign invasion could be successfully defended and the wrongs of the people redressed. The military bands and their leaders soon became the unifying force, and the fortified towns, the centers of a larger political organization, with the freeman (Kmiec or Kmeton) as its base. The first historical town of this nature was that of Kruszwica,Kruszwica, historic profile at www.gminy.cps.pl on the Lake of Gop≈Ço. It soon gave place to that of Gniezno or Knezno, further west, which by its very name indicates that it was the residence of a Knez, or prince or duke. In time Pozna≈Ñ became the princely town, and the principality began to assert itself and to grow westward to the Oder, southward to the Barycza and eastward to the Pilica Rivers. In the east this territorial expansion met with the armed opposition of another large tribe, the Lenczanians, which was similarly organized under a military ruler and which occupied the plains between the Warta, Bzura and Pilica Rivers. Further east, in the forests of the middle course of the Vistula to the north of Pilica, lived the most savage of the Polish tribes, the Masovians. This tribe was the latest to come under the sovereignty of the principality and began its political existence on the bank of the Gop≈Ço Lake under the leadership of the Piast, whose dynasty ruled the country until 1370. To the north of the Netze River between the Oder and the Baltic, lived the northernmost of the tribes , at times conquered by Poland, known as Pomorzanie (in the Polish: people living by the sea); hence the name of the province Pomorze. The Gospel Book of Kruszwica (ca.1160) is considered among the most precious mediaeval manuscripts in Poland Some historical writers attribute the change in the political organization of the primitive Polanie tribe to the influence of foreign commerce, which for geographic reasons had early centered on the Gop≈Ço. At that period the lake was a very large body of water with a level at least ten feet higher than at present. The many small lakes now existing in the region were in all probability a part of Gop≈Ço, and the valleys of the vicinity constituted the bottom of the lake. There are many reasons to believe that such was the hydrography of the section in that remote age. In his description of Gop≈Ço, written five hundred years ago, Jan D≈Çugosz, a Polish historian, speaks of a vast body of water, leading us to believe that the lake then was much larger than it is at the present time. There is reason to believe that five hundred years previous to this historian's time, before the primeval forests were cut, the lake was still larger. The supposition that Gop≈Ço at the time of its highest level was connected by means of small navigable streams with the rivers Warta, Oder and the Vistula is quite plausible. The constructive fancy of the economic historian sees flotillas of Pomeranian merchants moving to and fro from Szczecin (Stettin) down the Oder and Netze. Here they met merchants from the east, the southeast and the southwest of Europe. The Byzantine, Roman and Scandinavian cultures met at Kruszwica, the largest town on the banks of this vast internal sea of Poland, and exercised a revolutionary effect upon the modes of thought and the political institutions of the tribe. Otherwise the sudden transformation which took place from the tribal and communal organization of the people, which still existed in the second half of the eighth century, to the militaristic structure of society with a strong princely power, as is known to have existed in the ninth century, becomes almost unaccountable. The pressure from the west and north was, no doubt, an important element, but it alone would hardly seem sufficient to explain the change. Economic and cultural reasons had unquestionably exercised a great influence in the rapid molding of a new form of political life which was more adapted to conditions that had arisen since the change from nomadic pursuits to settled agriculture.

History Mogilno is one of the oldest settlements along the border of the Greater Poland and Kuyavia historical regions. Since the turn of the 8th and 9th century until the 10th century an early-mediaeval settlement existed there, at the long narrow headland surrounded by waters of Mogilno Lake from the west and south and marshes from the east. In 1065, a Benedictine abbey was founded there by Boles≈Çaw the Generous. North of the abbey a town later developed, which in 1398 was granted a city charter, and which was the abbey's property until 1773. After the first Partition of Poland in 1772 the city became a part of the Kingdom of Prussia, and in 1920 it returned to Poland.

Situated in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship (since 1999), it was previously in the Torun Voivodeship (1975‚Äì1998). It is the capital of Golub-Dobrzy≈Ñ County and has a population of 13,060. History Golub-Dobrzy≈Ñ initially consisted of two separate towns: Golub located north of the Drwƒôca in Che≈Çmno Land and Dobrzy≈Ñ located south of the Drwƒôca in the Dobrzy≈Ñ Land. The two cities were united May 5, 1951. =History of Golub= Saint Catherine's Church in Golub The village Golub (; ), populated by Poles, was first mentioned in a document from 1258; Che≈Çmno Land, or Culmerland, had been in the hands of the Teutonic Knights since 1231. The Teutonic Knights built a castle (1296‚Äì1306) and elevated it to town status. In 1421 all privileges of the town were confirmed by Grand Master Michael K√ºchmeister von Sternberg. Golub was severely damaged during wars in 1414 and 1422; the latter war called the Gollub War. The town became part of Poland according to the Second Peace of Thorn (1466). The height of prosperity of Golub was reached during the rule of King Sigismund III Vasa 1611-25. The town was severely damaged during Polish-Swedish Wars, especially in 1626-29, 1655, and 1660, as well as the later Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì63). In the First Partition of Poland in 1772, Golub was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. From 1807-15 it belonged to the Duchy of Warsaw. It was assigned to the Duchy of Poznan in 1815, and in 1817 it was included in West Prussia. In 1871 it was included in Imperial Germany and was subject to Germanisation. In January 1920 it became part of Poland. In August 1920, the Red Army attacked the city. In 1939 it was annexed by Nazi Germany and most of dwellers were forced to sign the Volksliste. =History of Dobrzy≈Ñ= Historical tenement Since the second half of the 17th century, Dobrzy≈Ñ () existed as a settlement on the left bank of the Drwƒôca. In 1684 Zygmunt Dzia≈Çy≈Ñski named the settlement Przedmie≈õcie Golubskie. In 1789 Count Ignacy Dzia≈Çy≈Ñski founded the city of Dobrzy≈Ñ. In 1793 after the Second Partition of Poland, Dobrzy≈Ñ was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. From 1807-15 it belonged to the Duchy of Warsaw. In 1815 it was included in the Kingdom of Poland in personal union with the Russian Empire. In the second half of the 19th century the Kingdom of Poland was annexed by Russia and the city developed quickly with a growing Jewish population. Eventually Dobrzy≈Ñ became larger than Golub. Dobrzy≈Ñ became part of the Second Polish Republic in 1918 following World War I. In August 1920, the Soviet Red Army attacked the city. In 1939 it was annexed by Nazi Germany and most of its dwellers were deported to Nazi concentration camps. The local intelligentsia was murdered through executions.

It is a resident breeder across the Indian subcontinent, including Sri Lanka extending east to Burma and parts of Tibet. It has been introduced in many other parts of the world and has established itself in the wild on several Pacific islands including Fiji, Samoa, Tonga and Hawaii. It has also established itself in parts of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, the United States and Argentina.Long, John L. (1981). Introduced Birds of the World. Agricultural Protection Board of Western Australia, 21-493 It is included in the list of the world's 100 worst invasive alien species. Taxonomy and systematics In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the red-vented bulbul in his Ornithologie based on a specimen that he mistakenly believed had been collected from the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. He used the French name Le merle hup√© du Cap de Bonne Esp√©rance and the Latin Merula Cristata Capitis Bonae Spei. The two stars () at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the red-vented bulbul. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Turdus cafer and cited Brisson's work. The red-vented bulbul does not occur in Africa. The type location was later changed to Sri Lanka and then in 1952 designated as Pondicherry in India by the German naturalist Erwin Stresemann. The specific epithet cafer is New Latin for South Africa. This species is now placed in the genus Pycnonotus that was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1826. Two formerly designated races, P. c. nigropileus in southern Burma and P. c. burmanicus of northern Burma, are now considered as hybrids. =Subspecies= Eight subspecies are recognized: * Central Indian red-vented bulbul (P. c. humayuni) - Deignan, 1951: Found in south-eastern Pakistan, north-western and north-central India * Punjab red- vented bulbul (P. c. intermedius) - Blyth, 1846: Originally described as a separate species. Found in Kashmir and Kohat down to the Salt Range and along the western Himalayas to Kumaon. * P. c. bengalensis - Blyth, 1845: Originally described as a separate species. Found in the central and eastern Himalayas from Nepal to Assam, north-eastern India and Bangladesh * P. c. stanfordi - Deignan, 1949: Found in northern Burma and south-western China * P. c. melanchimus - Deignan, 1949: Found in south-central Burma and northern Thailand * P. c. wetmorei - Deignan, 1960: Found in eastern India * P. c. cafer - (Linnaeus, 1766): Found in southern India * P. c. haemorrhousus - (Gmelin, JF, 1789): Found in Sri Lanka Red-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer humayuni).jpgP. c. humayuni Rajasthan, India PycnonotusMagrathiKeulemans.jpgP. leucogenys x P. c. humayuni hybrid (magrathi) Red vented Bulbul I IMG 6303.jpgUnderside of P. c. bengalensis Red-vented bulbul - Sri Lanka - 01.jpgP. c. haemorrhousus, Sri Lanka. Description The red-vented bulbul is easily identified by its short crest giving the head a squarish appearance. The body is dark brown with a scaly pattern while the head is darker or black. The rump is white while the vent is red. The black tail is tipped in white. The Himalayan races have a more prominent crest and are more streaked on the underside. The Race intermedius of the Western Himalayas has a black hood extending to the mid- breast. Population bengalensis of Central and Eastern Himalayas and the Gangetic plain has a dark hood, lacks the scale like pattern on the underside and instead has dark streaks on the paler lower belly. Race stanfordi of the South Assam hills is similar to intermedius. The desert race humayuni has a paler brown mantle. The nominate race cafer is found in Peninsular India. Northeast Indian race wetmorei is between cafer, humayuni and bengalensis. About 20 cm in length, with a long tail. Sri Lankan race haemorrhous (=haemorrhousus) has a dark mantle with narrow pale edges. Race humayuni is known to hybridize with Pycnonotus leucogenys and these hybrids were once described as a subspecies magrathi marked by their pale rumps and yellow- orange or pink vents. In eastern Myanmar there is some natural hybridization with Pycnonotus aurigaster. Sexes are similar in plumage, but young birds are duller than adults. The typical call has been transcribed as ginger beer but a number of sharp single note calls likened as pick are also produced. Their alarm calls are usually responded to and heeded by many other species of bird. Melanistic as well as leucistic individuals have been noted. An individual with aberrant colour form was observed in Bhavans College Campus, Andheri, Mumbai. Distribution and habitat This is a bird of dry scrub, open forest, plains and cultivated lands. In its native range it is rarely found in mature forests. A study based on 54 localities in India concluded that vegetation is the single most important factor that determines the distribution of the species. It has been introduced into Hawaii and Fiji. They were introduced to Samoa in 1943 and became common on Upolu by 1957. Red-vented bulbuls were introduced to Fiji around 1903 by indentured labourers from India. They established on the Tongan islands of Tongatapu and Niuafo'ou. They were introduced into Melbourne around 1917 but were not seen after 1942. They established in Auckland in the 1950s but were exterminated and another wild population that was detected was exterminated in 2006. In 2013 more were found, and authorities offered a $1000 reward for information that led to a bird's capture.Labour angry at $1000 angry bird reward. 3 News NZ. 15 November 2013. They prefer the dry lowland regions in these introduced regions. They were first observed breeding on the Canary Islands in 2018. They are considered as pests because of their habit of damaging fruit crops. Methiocarb and ziram have been used to protect cultivated Dendrobium orchids in Hawaii from damage by these birds. These birds learn to avoid the repellent chemicals. They can also disperse the seeds of invasive plants like Lantana camara and Miconia calvescens. Behaviour and ecology Nest Red-vented bulbuls feed on fruits, petals of flowers, nectar, insects and occasionally house geckos (Hemidactylus flaviviridis). They have also been seen feeding on the leaves of Medicago sativa. Red-vented bulbuls build their nests in bushes at a height of around two or three eggs is a typical clutch. Nests are occasionally built inside houses or in a hole in a mud bank. In one instance, a nest was found on a floating mat of Water hyacinth leaves and another observer noted a pair nesting inside a regularly used bus. Nests in tree cavities have also been noted. Nesting in safe cavities of residence buildings have also been noted They breed from June to September. The eggs are pale- pinkish with spots of darker red more dense at the broad end. They are capable of having multiple clutches in a year. Nests are small flat cups made of small dry twigs and spider web but sometimes making use of metal wires. The eggs hatch after about 14 days. Both parents feed the chicks and on feeding trips wait for the young to excrete, swallowing the faecal sacs produced for the first few days when the bacterial level is minimum. Later they carry the faecal sacs and dump them elsewhere. The pied crested cuckoo is a brood parasite of this species. Fires, heavy rains and predators are the main causes of fledgling mortality in scrub habitats in southern India. Eggs inside the nest Their vocalizations are usually stereotyped and they call throughout the year. However, a number of distinct call types have been identified including roosting, begging, greeting, flight and two kinds of alarm calls. They are important dispersers of seed of plants such as Carissa spinarum. The red- vented bulbul was among the first animals other than humans that was found to be incapable of synthesizing vitamin C. However a large number of birds were later found to likewise lack the ability to synthesize vitamin C. Like most birds, these bulbuls are hosts to coccidian blood parasites (Isospora sp.) while some bird lice such as Menacanthus guldum (Ansari 1951 Proc. Natl. Inst. Sci. India 17:40) have been described as ectoparasites. Along with red- whiskered bulbuls this species has led to changes in the population dynamics of butterfly morphs on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. Here the population of white morphs of the Danaus plexippus butterfly have risen over a period of 20 years due to predation of the orange morphs by these bulbuls. In culture In 19th-century India these birds were frequently kept as cage pets and for fighting especially in the Carnatic region. They would be held on the finger with a thread attached and when they fought they would seize the red feathers of the opponents. . In the state of Assam of India, the Bulbul (‡¶¨‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡¶¨‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡ßÄ) bird as it is known in Assamese, the male birds were held captive for a few days and were engaged in fights as a spectator sport in the Bihu festival during the Ahom rule.

Naundorff was one of the more stubborn of more than thirty men who claimed to be Louis XVII. Biography Prince Louis- Charles, the son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, was imprisoned during the French Revolution and believed to have died in prison. However, there were various rumors that monarchist sympathizers had spirited the young dauphin away from the Temple prison and that he was living elsewhere in secret. The first records of Karl Wilhelm Naundorff are from 1810 in Spandau, Berlin, where he received the citizenship of Prussia. By 1822 he had moved to live with a family in Brandenburg-on-the-Havel where he was later accused of arson and 1824 was jailed for three years for counterfeiting. =Impersonation= When he was released in 1827, he moved to Crossen and wrote the first of two books of would-be-memoirs. The second he wrote in England many years later and was translated to English by Charles G. Perceval, Rector of Calverton, Buckinghamshire, and nephew of Spencer Perceval. He claimed that he had been substituted with a deaf and mute orphan who died soon afterward and that he had been hidden in a secret area of the Tower of the Temple until his escape. He also claimed that he was later recaptured by Napoleon's forces and secretly kept in several dungeons throughout Europe until finally escaping in his mid- twenties. He could present no proof of any of this. Using a ring he had received from Naundorff, Jules Favre, French Minister of Foreign Affairs, puts his seal on the Treaty of Frankfurt. In 1833, Naundorff travelled to Paris where another claimant to the French throne, the Duke of Richemont, was on trial. One of the witnesses for the prosecution read out his letter as a counterclaim. Despite the fact that Naundorff did not speak French very well, he managed to convince various former members of the Louis XVI's court that he was the Dauphin. He seemed to know everything about the private life of the royal court, gave right answers to most questions and spoke to courtiers as if he had known them as a child. One of them was Agathe de Rambaud, Louis' childhood nurse who accepted him. Others who claimed to have recognized him as the prince include √âtienne de Joly, King Louis XVI's Minister of Justice, and Jean Bremond, the king's personal secretary. However, Princess Marie-Th√©r√®se, the sister of Prince Louis, did not acknowledge him. She had seen pictures of him, claimed she did not see any resemblance to her brother and refused even to see him despite having seen other claimants who were not represented by former members of the royal court. On one occasion Agathe de Rambaud travelled to Prague by carriage to persuade her but to no avail as the princess refused to see her as well. In 1836, Naundorff sued Marie Th√©r√®se for property that supposedly belonged to him. Instead, the police force of king Louis-Philippe arrested him, seized all his papers and deported him to England. There he worked to develop several military inventions, including an early grenade, and a recoilless rifle which he eventually sold to the Dutch Military. He declared that he would be restored to the throne on January 1, 1840. When that date passed, he lost the majority of his supporters. =Legacy and continued controversy= Naundorff's grave in Delft. The inscription says \\"Here rests Louis XVII\\". Naundorff died on August 10, 1845 in Delft, the Netherlands, possibly of poisoning. He had been living there with his family after being made Director of Pyrotechnics for the Dutch Military. He still had some supporters because the epitaph on his grave reads \\"Here lies Louis XVII, King of France\\" and in his death certificate he is named as \\"Charles-Louis de Bourbon, Duke of Normandy (Louis XVII), who was known under the name of Charles-Guillaume Naundorff, [...] son of His Majesty the late Louis XVI, King of France and of Her Imperial and Royal Highness Marie Antoinette, Archduchess of Austria, Queen of France, who both died in Paris\\". Death certificate France has insisted this document be set aside but the Netherlands has refused. Naundorff's descendants did not give up. Some of them insisted on using the surname \\"de Bourbon\\" and they petitioned for recognition to French courts and senates all through the 19th and 20th centuries. Circus director Ren√© Charles \\"de Bourbon,\\" an illegitimate son of one of Naundorff's grandchildren, lost his claim in a French court in 1954. However, some of the descendants still press the claim. A handful of French historians insist that DNA testing finally resolved the issue of Naundorff's claim; mitochondrial DNA sequences of remains that researchers have claimed to have belonged to Naundorff were compared with sequences obtained from the remains of Marie-Antoinette and two of her sisters and two living maternal relatives. They argue that differences in the nucleotide sequences make it very unlikely that Naundorff was the son of Marie-Antoinette. A group of his descendants disagree that the remains are those of Naundorff and are independently continuing the investigation.

TI is located approximately north of Cape York Peninsula in Far North Queensland, Australia. Thursday Island is also the name of the town in the south and west of the island and also the name of the locality which contains the island within the Shire of Torres. The town of Rose Hill (known as Abednego until 7 September 1991) is located on the north-eastern tip of the island (). In the , Thursday Island had a population of 2,938 people.  Geography  Thursday Island has an area of about . The highest point on Thursday Island, standing at above sea level, is Milman Hill, a World War II defence facility. While Thursday Island is within the Shire of Torres and is the administrative centre for that shire, it is also the administrative and commercial centre of the local government area of Torres Strait Island Region despite not being part of that local government area. History The island has been populated for thousands of years by the Torres Strait Islanders, though archeological evidence on Badu, further north in Torres Strait, suggests that the area has been inhabited from before the end of the last Ice Age. The archaeology from Badu, Pulu, Saibai and Mer shows that Melanesian occupation started around 2,600 years ago (see Kalaw Lagaw Ya). In 1848 a hydrographic survey of the area was conducted by Captain Owen Stanley of the Royal Navy, the commander of HMS Rattlesnake. He named this island Friday Island and another island Thursday Island (presumably reflecting the day of the week on which he named them). However, in June 1855 Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort of the Royal Navy (the Admiralty Hydrographer ) decided to switch the names around so the present-day Thursday Island would appear on the left of present-day Friday Island on a map. The original place of permanent European settlement in Torres Strait was Somerset, south-east of the tip of Cape York Peninsula, established in 1864. However, the channel between Albany Island and Somerset proved to be hazardous for a port and in 1875 it was jointly decided by the Queensland and British governments to transfer the port to the deep anchorage on the south side of Thursday Island. The new port was called Port Kennedy, after Edmund Kennedy, the explorer of Cape York Peninsula, was established in 1867. The town that developed on the island was also called Port Kennedy, but on 1 June 1962 the town was renamed Thursday Island. In 1877, an administrative centre for the Torres Strait Islands was set up on the island by the Queensland Government and by 1883 over 200 pearling vessels were based on the island. =Pearl trade= A lucrative pearling industry was founded on the island in 1884, attracting workers from around Asia, including Japan, Malaya and India, seeking their fortune.Anna Shnukal (ed.), Guy Ramsay (ed.), Yuriko Nagata (ed.), 2004: Navigating Boundaries: The Asian Diaspora in Torres Strait. Pandanus Books, Canberra. The Japanese community was in part indentured divers and boat hands who returned to Japan after a period of service and some longer term residents who were active in boat building and in the ownership of luggers for hire - which was illegal but bypassed by leases through third parties back to other Japanese, a practice called \\"dummying\\".Regina Ganter (1994). The Pearl-Shellers of Torres Strait: Resource Use, Development and Decline, 1860s-1960s. Melbourne University Press Additionally, many south Pacific Islanders worked in the industry, with some originally imported against their will, in a practice known as blackbirding. While the pearling industry has declined in importance, the mix of cultures is evident to this day. The pearling industry centred on the harvesting of pearl shell, which was used mainly to make shirt buttons. The local pearl oyster is Golden Lip Oyster, Pinctada maxima. =Shell trade= Trochus shell was also gathered using specialized boats. Most shell was exported as the raw material - to a London-based market. Pearls themselves were rare and a bonus for the owner or crew.Farwell, George, Cape York to the Kimberleys, Rigby Limited, Adelaide, 1962, chapter 8 The boats used were very graceful two-masted luggers. In shallow water free diving was used while in deeper water diver's dress, or an abbreviated form of it, with a surface air supply was used. In good times there were three divers to a lugger, a stern diver, one midships, and one diver off the bow. A manual air compressor was used. It looked like a yard-wide cube with two large wheels mounted one on each side. For part of the fleet that operated further from Thursday Island, larger vessels, typically schooners were used as mother ships to the luggers. Shell was usually opened on the mother vessels rather than on the luggers, in order to secure any pearls found. The waters of the Straits are murky and visibility was generally very poor. Even though dive depths were not great, except at the Darnley Deep (near Darnley or Erub Island), which was 40 fathoms (240 feet), attacks of the bends were common and deaths frequent. =Telegraph, trade, and cyclone= On 25 August 1887, The Paterson (Cape York) Telegraph Station on the West Coast of Cape York was opened. It connected the Cape York Telegraph Line with Thursday Island, via an undersea cable. In the late-19th and early-20th centuries Thursday Island was a regular stop for vessels trading between the east coast of Australia and Southeast Asia. A shipping disaster to a vessel in this service occurred in 1890 when struck an uncharted reef in the Strait and sank in five minutes with the loss of over 130 lives. The Anglican Church on Thursday Island built shortly afterwards was named the Quetta All Souls Memorial Cathedral in memory of the event.Foley, J C H, 1982: Timeless Isle. Torres Strait Historical Society, Thursday Island. Today the church is called All Souls and St Bartholomew Church. Cyclone Mahina, which hit Bathurst Bay, southeast of Thursday Island in 1899, wrecked the pearling fleet sheltering there, with huge losses of vessels and lives. =Fort= The fear of Russian invasion as a result of the deterioration of relations between the Russian Empire and the British Empire led to a fort on Battery Point being built in 1892 to protect the island. The fort has not been in operation since 1927, but is today a heritage feature of the island. =Twentieth century= Customs House on Thursday Island. Local pearling declined steadily up to the World War II, partly through competition from a Japanese-based fleet which did not use local resources or personnel. In the 1950s plastic buttons imitating pearl supplanted much of the demand for shell. Before the decline, pearl fishing was taken by the island-based fleet to the Aru Islands in what was then the Dutch East Indies.Wood, C.M. 1972 Pearling off the Aru Islands by Captain C.M Cowling as told to his daughter. The Dog Watch 29:47-58. During World War II, Thursday Island became the military headquarters for the Torres Strait and was a base for Australian and United States forces. January 1942 saw the evacuation of civilians from the island. Residents of Japanese origin or descent were interned. The residents did not return until after the end of the war and many ethnic Japanese were forcibly repatriated. The island was spared from bombing in World War II, due, it was thought, to it being the burial place of many Japanese pearl shell divers, or possibly the Japanese thinking there were still Japanese residents on the island. However, neighboring Horn Island was extensively bombed. There was an airbase there, used by the Allies to attack parts of New Guinea. At the end of the war, the island tradition of a no-footwear policy was reinstated in respect for the ancient spirits believed to reside on the island. After the war, an airline service was set up by Ansett Airlines from Cairns to TI twice a week, using de Havilland Dragon Rapides and later DC3s. Passengers disembarked on Horn Island and caught a ferry-boat over to TI, as they still do. The island was also served by a ship, the Elsana, which made the journey once a month. For a short period after the war Okinawan divers were used on the luggers but this was not a great success. In the 1950s, the CSIRO attempted to establish cultured pearl farms, but many were devastated by disease in the 1970s. The trigger is considered by some to be the use of dispersants on the 1970 oil spill from the tanker Oceanic Grandeur. This industry still exists around the island today. In the 1970s, there was also an attempt to farm green turtles. The Melanesian background of the Thursday Islanders became an issue in the 1970s, when Papua New Guinea sought to include some of the Torres Strait Islands within its borders. The Torres Strait Islanders insisted that they were Australians, however, and after considerable diplomatic discussion and political disputation between the Queensland and the Federal Governments, all of the Torres Strait islands, including Thursday Island, remained part of Australia. From 1900 to 1996 the Quetta Memorial Church on the island was the cathedral church of the large Diocese of Carpentaria which included North Queensland, the Islands of the Torres Strait and, to 1968, Northern Territory. = Twenty-first century = At the , Thursday Island had a population of 2,610.

Heritage listings Thursday Island has a number of heritage- listed sites, including: * Chester Street: Green Hill Fort *Douglas Street: Quetta Memorial Precinct * 120 Douglas Street: Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Church * Summers Street: Thursday Island Cemetery (incorporating the Japanese Cemetery & the Grave of the Hon. John Douglas) * 2 Victoria Parade: Thursday Island Customs House The Gab Titui Cultural Centre (2004) on Thursday Island showcases both heritage and contemporary Islander artworks.see Accessed 15 February 2014 Economy The Island is one of the two bases for the Torres Straits Pilots, a cooperative owned and run by qualified Master Mariners who pilot ships through the Straits and down to Cairns. This is a necessary service because navigation through the area is tricky due to the extensive reef systems. The island has the area hospital and courts, is the regional centre for higher education, a centre for some research organisations and is the administrative base for the local, state and federal governments. Banking and phones are available. Thursday Island is only in part self-sufficient for water, some being piped from the adjacent island. It has two wind turbines which generate some of its electricity requirement. The economy of the island is dependent on its role as an administrative centre and is supported by pearling and fishing, as well as a fast-developing tourism industry, with perhaps the most famous tourists being novelist Somerset Maugham and Banjo Paterson, and the most numerous being day-trippers from the cruise ships that call into the island each year.Search under \\"Ports visited\\" on http://www.cruising.com.au to see cruise ships which call at Thursday Island. Climate Thursday Island has a tropical savanna climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Aw) with hot temperatures year round. The wet season typically runs from December through April and is very rainy. Language Torres Strait Creole is the dominant language spoken on Thursday Island by the Islanders, followed by Kalaw Lagaw Ya, commonly called Mabuiag (pronounced Mobyag) by many, although English is also spoken. The indigenous language is Kaiwaligau Ya, another dialect of Kalaw Lagaw Ya, otherwise known as Kowrareg, (or more correctly Kauraraigau Ya, the name used by the people in the mid to late 1800s). Amenities Thursday Island has number of services open to the community, including a sporting complex, gym, public library as well as ANZAC park and Ken Brown Oval. There is a community pharmacy, general store, butcher, bank and many other essential services. The Shire of Torres operates Ngulaig Meta Municipal public library at 121 Douglas Street. The current library facility opened in 2015.  Education  Tagai State College is a government primary and secondary (Early Childhood-12) school for boys and girls that operates 17 campuses throughout the Torres Strait, including two on Thursday Island. The Thursday Island primary school campus (Early Childhood-6) is at 31 Hargrave Street (). The Thursday Island secondary school campus (7-12) is at 21 Aplin Road () In 2017, the school across all location had a total enrolment of 1,554 students with 168 teachers (165 full-time equivalent) and 198 non-teaching staff (142 full-time equivalent). The school includes a special education program at Summers Street (). Our Lady of the Sacred Heart School is a Catholic primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Normanby Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 103 students with 12 teachers (9 full-time equivalent) and 13 non-teaching staff (9 full-time equivalent). The Torres Strait Campus of the Tropical North Queensland TAFE Institute is located on the island next to the Tagai State College.
