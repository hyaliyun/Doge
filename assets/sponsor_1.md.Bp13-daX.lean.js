LGBT individuals comprise a much larger percentage of the population in neopagan circles than larger, mainstream religious populations. There are some popular neopagan traditions which have beliefs often in conflict with the LGBT community, and there are also traditions accepting of, created by, or led by LGBT individuals. The majority of conflicts concern heteronormativity and cisnormativity.  Demographics and prevalence  = Orientation = A 2003 survey by Helen A. Berger found 28.3% of American neopagans identified in survey as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. In 2013, a survey of neopagans in England, Wales, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand found 49.8% of women and 44.5% of men identified as non-heterosexual. Of the non-heterosexual female demographic, 78.5% of identified as bisexual and 11.2% identified as lesbian/gay; of the non-heterosexual male demographic, 55.2% identified as gay and 37.1% identified as bisexual. A 2015 study survey by Pew Research Center found that 11% of lesbian, gay, and bisexual respondents identified with non- Christian faiths, a large portion of which being some form of neopaganism or interfaith universalist beliefs. This was nearly double the general population. = Gender = While the Western neopagan community is gender- diverse as a whole, the demographics tend toward female plurality or dominance in terms of numbers. The aforementioned 2013 scientific survey of Western neopagans found that women were not only the dominant neopagan demographic, but the proportion thereof was increasing across the board in many countries surveyed. However, men tended to dominate certain traditions like Norse Heathenry, Druidry, Neo-Shamanism, Ceremonial Magic, and Thelema.  Historical gender context  The concept of \\"the witch\\" varies significantly among cultures, societies, belief systems, power structures, time periods, and other sociological factors. However, the most predominant Western gender concept of the witch is female stemming from a variety of culture beliefs. This reflects in statistical analysis of historical documents showing that typically those prosecuted for witchcraft were women on average about 70 to 80 percent of the time, most of the time women over the age of 50. Actual practitioners of witchcraft in the general population varied historically. Like today, men were more likely to practice certain disciplines, an example of such being white magic in pre-modern England. The Malleus Maleficarum (1486), one of the most notable and infamous texts concerning witchcraft, specifically postulated that women were more predisposed or likely to engage in witchcraft and paganism than men, and thus most witches were women. Jean Bodin (a 16th Century French demonologist) is noted to have claimed women are fifty-times more likely to engage in witchcraft.  Philosophical and theological issues  The most typical neopagan ideological issues that affect LGBT perception and interaction are sexuality, gender binary dualism, and gender essentialism. Triple Goddess (Crone aspect) and Horned God, the classic neopagan duotheistic pairing.alt=Two brownish metal bust statues on pedestals. On the left, a bearded, aged man with deer horns representing the Horned God. On the right, an aged woman with a waning crescent above her forehead representing the senescent \\"crone\\" form of the Triple Goddess. = Gender dualism, essentialism, and sexual orientation = Binary gender essentialism is highly present in neopagan communities and their respective theological/philosophical belief systems. Pagan sources themselves, such as the Pagan Federation of the U.K., align with the academic understanding of pagan essentialism in the gender binary. The basis of the difference is commonly reflected in discussion about spiritual energy, which is often believed to be intrinsically masculine or feminine in type. A preeminent example of pagan binary belief exists in the common practice of venerating a God-Goddess duality, often specifically the pairing of the Triple Goddess and Horned God. The Goddess (representing the feminine) is traditionally seen as receptive, fertile, nurturing, and passive (cast as the Moon), while the God (representing the masculine) as impregnative, a hunter, and active/aggressive (cast as the Sun). This theological archetype is inherently heterosexual and reflected in the beliefs and practices of many neopagan practitioners. The gender duality has a significant impact on the working of magic and spellcraft, a widely-held neopagan belief, because tradition requires strict heterosexual pairing to balance and effect the desired magic or spell. This can be a struggle for LGBTQ pagans who find the exemplified duality not reflective of their own feelings and desires. = Recent historical views on sexuality and gender= In the mid-20th century dawn of Neopaganism, heterosexual dualism was most exemplified in the \\"Great Rite\\" of British Traditional Wicca, one of the first notable neopagan ideological groups. In this Rite, a priest and priestess \\"were cast into rigidly gendered, heteronormative roles\\" in which the pairing performed a symbolic or literal representation of heterosexual intercourse which was considered vital for venerating supernatural entities and performing magic. It is notable that early neopagan views on sex were radical for their time in their sex positivity and tacit acceptance of BDSM. Later in the 20th Century, as Wicca spread to North America, it incorporated countercultural, second-wave feminist, and LGBTQ elements. The essentialist rigidity fluctuated under the influence of Carl Jung's notions of anima and animus and non-heterosexual orientations became more acceptable. By the 1980s and 1990s, figures like Vivianne Crowley and Starhawk continued the evolving beliefs. Crowley associated the Jungian binary with classical elements possessed by all—the feminine/anima with water and the masculine/animus with fire. Starhawk, espousing views similar to Crowley in her 1979 edition of her seminal book The Spiral Dance, began calling into question the masculine-feminine divisions entirely by the 1999 edition, and instead focusing on traits instead of gender archetypes. At the dawn of the 21st century, queer neopagans and their sects began to assert themselves more publicly. These LGBT-aligned groups \\"challenged the gender essentialism remaining in the sexual polarity still practiced\\" which remained in certain Wicca and feminist neopagan enclaves. Greater exploration and acceptance of queer and transgender figures began not only for adherents but deities and mythological figures as well. In addition, sex positivity and BDSM were brought back into active exploration and acceptance.  LGBT issues in specific sects, paths, and traditions  The pentacle, a circumscribed pentagram, one of the most common symbols of Wicca. = Wicca = Wiccan traditions hold a wide range of differing beliefs about sexual orientation and gender identity. However, Wicca is regarded by many practitioners as a fertility religion. Starhawk wrote in her 1982 book Dreaming the Dark, \\"Sexuality was a sacrament in the Old Religion; it was (and is) viewed as a powerful force through which the healing, fructifying love of the immanent Goddess was directly known, and could be drawn down to nourish the world, _to quicken fertility_ in human beings and in nature\\". Most Wiccans worship the Goddess and God. Melissa Harrington, writing about sexuality and Wicca, noted the Goddess and God themselves, along with the Wheel of the Year that venerates them, are a \\"predominantly heterosexual model\\". Harrington also specifies how sexual activity is sacramental to Wiccans. Some asexual Wiccans/pagans have issues with this sexual veneration in regards to their personal beliefs. Furthermore, a central part of Wiccan liturgy involves the Great Rite;Farrar, Stewart. What Witches Do: A Modern Coven Revealed (1973) London: Sphere Books. pp85-94. an act of actual or symbolic ritual sexual intercourse between the two deities. This is traditionally carried out by a priest and priestess who have had the deities invoked upon them, and the conventional practice appears to be exclusively heterosexual. When performed 'in token' this involves the athame (representing the penis) descending into the chalice (representing the vagina).Crowley, Vivianne. Wicca: The Old Religion in the New Age (1989) London: The Aquarian Press. p.234 Gardnerian and Alexandrian groups typically form their covens from male-female pairs exclusively. Kraemer writes, \\"The British Traditional Wicca of the 1950s and 1960s saw masculine and feminine energies as wholly distinct from each other, yet complementary. Although masculinity and femininity were to be valued equally, priestesses and priests were cast into rigidly gendered, heteronormative roles.\\" Gardnerian Gerald Gardner, the eponymous founder of Gardnerian Wicca, particularly stressed heterosexual approaches to Wicca. As Jan Van Cleve, former practitioner of traditional Wicca, wrote, \\"Much of Gardnerian magic is based on this notion that physical interaction between male and female is not only desirable, but also necessary.\\" This practice may stem from Gardner's text (ostensibly quoting a witch, but perhaps in his own words):Gardner, Gerald. Witchcraft Today (1954) London: Rider. p. 69 Gardner was accused of homophobia by Lois Bourne, one of the High Priestesses of the Bricket Wood coven: > \\"Gerald was homophobic. He had a deep hatred and detestation of > homosexuality, which he regarded as a disgusting perversion and a flagrant > transgression of natural law... 'There are no homosexual witches, and it is > not possible to be a homosexual and a witch' Gerald almost shouted. No one > argued with him.\\"Bourne, Lois Dancing with Witches. (2006) London: Robert > Hale. . p.38. (Hardback edition first published 1998). However, the legitimacy of Gardner's rumored homophobia is disputable because Gardner showed much more evidence of an open and accepting attitude about practices in his writing which would not be characterized by the hatred or phobia which was common in the 1950s: > \\"Also, though the witch ideal is to form perfect couples of people ideally > suited to each other, nowadays this is not always possible; the right > couples go together and the rest go singly and do as they can. Witchcraft > today is largely a case of 'make do'.\\"Gardner, Gerald. Witchcraft Today > (1954) London: Rider. p. 125 As the titular leader of Gardnerian Wicca, it difficult to determine of the above passages whether they represent a personal view of Gardner, Gardner's religious teaching for the sect of Wicca, both, or neither. It is also unclear whether or not these views/teachings changed over time. Alexandrian Alex Sanders, the co-founder of Gardnerian offshoot Alexandrian Wicca, came out as bisexual later in life and created new rituals in which sexual orientation was irrelevant. However, a significant portion of Alexandrian belief is regarding heterosexual reproduction, best expressed by his wife and co-founder Maxine Sanders who is well known to emphasize the concept of male- female polarity and the fact that Alexandrian Wicca is a fertility religion. She also expressed concern about a proper functionality of transgender people (referred to as \\"transvestites\\") within coven practices, saying it best to look at other traditions that suit them more. \\"These people\\", as she is noted to have said, \\"they're not happy people.\\"On the Blackchair Podcast, Special Edition Series #3 - Tea With Maxine - On Initiation alt=A green pentagram circumscribed in black in center with a waxing crescent moon on the left and waning crescent moon on the right. Dianic Dianic Wicca has become notable for the female-focus and anti-transgender stances of its founder, Zsuzsanna Budapest, and many members. This female-only, radical feminist variant of Wicca allows cisgender lesbians but not transgender women in Dianic covens. This is due to Dianic belief in gender essentialism, specifically \\"you have to have sometimes [sic] in your life a womb, and ovaries and [menstruate] and not die\\" according to Budapest . This belief and the way it is expressed is often denounced as transphobia and trans-exclusionary radical feminism. Some Dianic practitioners, such as lesbian priestess Jan Van Cleve, see this discrimination as a reactionary impulse that will someday subside. Van Cleve writes: > \\"The relationship of the Feminist Movement to Dianic Wicca has been a mixed > blessing. On the one hand, it liberated Wiccan women from patriarchal > notions of paganism, which claimed that all energy comes from the > male/female polarity. The early neo-Pagan leaders were all men and sex > between sexes occupied a large part of their attention and sometimes even > their rituals. This was rejected by feminists who sought a spirituality they > could call exclusively their own. However, as feminism was a reaction to > oppression, it carried with it a mindset colored by it.

These are normal growing pains of any movement and as straight and > lesbian women have by now largely overcome their orientation differences, > they will no doubt soon overcome their fears of their transgendered sisters > as well.\\" = Heathenry = Mjölnir, the hammer of Norse deity Thor, a common symbol and adornment of Heathen practitioners.Heathenry, neopaganism drawing from historical Scandinavian (Norse) and Germanic pagan beliefs, typically is more ideologically conservative than most neopagan traditions when it comes to gender roles.  Norse-Specific  Norse Heathenry has a complex relationship with LGBTQ subjects. The practice of seiðr is typically regarded as women-only magical practice, requiring an openness that draws parallels to the sexually receptive feminine role found in other neopagan beliefs. Non- female practitioners are sometimes targeted with homophobic or effeminate harassment.  Racial Paganism  Germanic occultism and neopaganism emerged in the early 20th Century and became influential, with beliefs such as Ariosophy, combining with the far-right Völkisch movement which eventually culminated in Nazism. Post-WWII continuations of similar beliefs have given rise to the Wotansvolk, a white nationalist neopagan movement, in the late 20th Century. Modern white supremacism and Neo-Nazism with all the racist, antisemitic, and anti-LGBTQ beliefs of those ideologies have either continued, infiltrated, and co-opted many Germanic and Norse Heathen traditions such as Ásatrú (sometimes called Odinism). These groups belief that Norse-Germanic beliefs to form the true Caucasian-European ethnoreligious group.  LGBT- inclusive paths and traditions  A symbol representing pagan gender diversity combining the pentagram with various gender symbols for binary, transgender, non-binary, and agender identities. = Wicca = Newer Wiccan traditions often avoid or disregard the historical aversion to LGBT individuals. Oboler notes the change in neopagan culture thus, \\"Although the symbolic bedrock of Wicca and modern Paganism is strongly gender-essentialist, the Pagan community, like the culture as a whole, has been moving away from that position.\\" These traditions sometimes cite the Wiccan Charge of the Goddess which says \\"All acts of Love and Pleasure are My rituals\\".Gardner, Gerald. Witchcraft and the Book of Shadows (2004) Edited by A.R.Naylor. Thame, Oxfordshire: I-H-O Books, p.70. Professor Melissa Harrington wrote that despite traditional Wicca showing heterosexism \\"as Wicca has grown and attracted gay practitioners they have begun to work out ways in which Wiccan rites can become more meaningful to them\\". According to professor and Wicca author Ann-Marie Gallagher, \\"There is a moralistic doctrine or dogma other than the advice offered in the Wiccan Rede... The only 'law' here is love... It matters that we are gay, straight, bisexual or transgender– the physical world is sacred, and [we are] celebrating our physicality, sexuality, human nature and celebrating the Goddess, Giver of ALL life and soul of ALL nature.\\" The Pagan Federation of Canada stated, \\"Over the last few decades, many people have thought that the emphasis on male/female polarity in Wicca excludes homosexuals.\\" However, the Federation goes on to make the case for the validity of LGBT orientations even within traditional Wicca, suggesting that gay men and lesbians are likely to be particularly alive to the interplay of the masculine and feminine principles in the Universe.Huneault, Robert.Homosexuality and Wicca. Pagan Federation/Fédération Païenne Canada website, accessed 11 May 2007. = Queer-specific paths =  Feri  The Feri Tradition, a modern form of traditional witchcraft has provided a home for many neopagan LGBT individuals. The Tradition is very open to non- heterosexual orientations and queer identities. Feri practitioner Storm Faerywolf writes: > \\"As any Queer practitioner can attest, there is a definite shortage of > Queer-specific models that encourage the strengthening of ourselves as whole > beings. In many Neo-Pagan Witchcraft traditions, we are told simply to adopt > the pre-existing (and heterosexist) magickal modalities of polarity and > fertility. In the Feri tradition we are given certain tools that enable us > to have healthier relationships with our Divine natures, devoid of any such > baggage.\\"  Minoan  Two Minoan traditions were founded in New York City in the 1970s. Minoan initiations and elevations are all conducted in single-gender circles. Both traditions continue to this day as oath-bound, initiatory mystery religions using a ritual framework descended from Gardnerian Wicca. *Minoan Brotherhood founded in 1975 by Edmund Buczynski, an elder in the Gardnerian, WICA, and New York Welsh Traditions, in order to create a tradition for gay and bisexual men—one that would celebrate and explore the distinctive mysteries unique to men who love men. *Minoan Sisterhood founded in 1976 by Lady Rhea and Lady Miw-Sekhmet, in collaboration with Buczynski, as the women's counterpart to the Brotherhood.  Phoenix  The Fellowship of the Phoenix (originally \\"Brotherhood\\") was founded in the summer of 2004 by seven gay men from diverse traditions such as ceremonial magic, shamanism, and pre-Gardnerian witchcraft in order to create an ecumenical neopagan tradition which serves the community of men who love men. The maxim of the Fellowship is \\"Find the Divine within your own experience.\\" In 2017, the Seattle Temple began a reformation within the group to expand the tradition to be \\"open to all queer/LBGTQIA adults\\" which has been accepted throughout. Fellowship theology has been modified to fit an expanded, inclusive model. Radical Faeries The Radical Faeries began in the 1970s as a predominantly gay male-oriented movement. The Faeries today are a loosely affiliated worldwide network and countercultural movement seeking to redefine queer consciousness through secular spirituality; the movement also adopts elements from anarchism and environmentalism. Certain events may be focused on gay male spirituality, while others are open to all genders and orientations.Morgensen, Scott. 2009. \\"Back and Forth to the Land: Negotiating Rural and Urban Sexuality Among the Radical Faeries.\\" In Ellen Lewin and William L.

John Wiley and Sons. , . = Secular, interfaith, and intersectional =  Naturalist, scientific, and humanist  Scientific pantheists and humanist or atheopagans, as well as others who practice forms of religious naturalism, frequently foster LGBTQ+ inclusion and combat historic bigotries.  Unitarian Universalism  The Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) states \\"we not only open our doors to people of all sexual orientations and gender identities, we value diversity of sexuality and gender and see it as a spiritual gift\\". The Covenant of Unitarian Universalist Pagans (CUUPS), the pagan-aligned affiliate of the UUA, echoes those beliefs with bylaws that state covenant membership \\"shall be open, without regard to race, color, sex, affectional or sexual orientation, gender expression, physical disability, national origin, or social condition.\\"  See also  *Haitian Vodou and sexual orientation *Homosexuality and religion *LGBT themes in mythology *Religion and LGBT people *Religion and sexuality *Transgender people and religion  Notes   References   Further reading  * Barrett, Ruth (2003), \\"Lesbian Rituals and Dianic Tradition\\" in Ramona Faith Oswald (ed), Lesbian Rites: Symbolic Acts and the Power of Community, The Haworth Press. *Conner, Randy P.

Prior to this, Bødskov had admitted that he had misinformed Folketing about why a visit to Christiania in 2012 was cancelled. The official explanation was that the Copenhagen police director could not participate, but the real reason was that DSIS warned about a security thread against Pia Kjærsgaard. In 2012 she matched Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen in an internal ballot, and in 2013 she surpassed her. Starting in 2013, she was named in the media as Schmidt-Nielsen's likely successor as political spokesperson of the Red-Green Alliance. In October 2014, Skipper joined the parliamentary committee that scrutinizes the Danish intelligence agencies. Prior to the 2015 election, held on 18 June, there was uncertainty as to whether Schmidt-Nielsen could stand for reelection due to the party's \\"rotation principle\\", depending on when Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt announced the election. Skipper was expected to become political spokesperson if Schmidt-Nielsen was not allowed to run, but as the election was announced before the Red-Green Alliance's congress, Schmidt-Nielsen did stand for reelection. In October 2015, Skipper was elected new lead candidate in Copenhagen constituency instead of Schmidt-Nielsen, and in May 2016 she was named political spokesperson for the Red-Green Alliance. Following her appointment, she ended her membership of the Socialist Workers Party, a Trotskyist party which is a part of the Red-Green Alliance.  Personal life  Skipper lives in Vesterbro. Since 2013 she has been in a relationship with Oliver Routhe Skov, who works as a journalist at DR. They married in 2015. They have a daughter, who was born on 25 October 2017.

The band has released four studio albums, most recently Wintersaga in September 2019. Their sound is heavy metal but can also be described using the sub- genres Power metal and folk metal with orchestration and vocal harmonies. Their lyrics take inspiration in the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, and their aesthetic is based on Tolkien's Dwarves. History In March 2010, a few months after their formation, Wind Rose released an EP called \\"Demo 2010\\" which was produced by Cristiano Bertocchi. On 28 August 2012 Wind Rose released their first full-length ‘Shadows Over Lothadruin’ via Bakerteam Records (secondary division of Scarlet Records). In 2013/2014 they performed a number of promotional live shows in Europe directly supporting Wintersun, Finntroll and Epica. Cristiano Bertocchi joined the band as bass player during 2014 before the band went to the studio to record the second full-length album. In February 2015, they took part in Eluveitie's Origins European tour and their second studio album Wardens of the West Wind was released by Scarlet Records. In October they also played as support for Ensiferum's Spanish shows during their One Man Army European tour. After these shows, Wind Rose dedicated the entire year 2016 to writing new material. In 2017, the band signed a deal with Inner Wound Recordings for their third album Stonehymn. It was released in May. The first video to be released was \\"The Wolves' Call\\" followed by \\"To Erebor\\" which gave more popularity to the band, reaching millions of contacts on their Facebook and on YouTube outlets. The virality of the video sparked the curiosity of the managers of music events. Thus Wind Rose was invited to participate in important metal festivals such as Bloodstock (United Kingdom) and Masters of Rock (Czech Republic). In January 2018, the band was asked to tour Japan with Ensiferum, and in April and May 2018 they joined the Path to Glory European tour with Ensiferum and Ex Deo. In December 2018, Wind Rose announced a deal with Napalm Records and the recording of a new album. On 6 June 2019 Wind Rose released the first single on Napalm: \\"Diggy Diggy Hole\\", a song originally written and performed by gaming YouTubers The Yogscast. The album Wintersaga was released on 27 September 2019.

She is a strong advocate for the protection of natural and indigenous ecosystems, and sustainable rural management.  Biography  Lucas grew up on Bendigo Station in the Otago high country, and learnt about conservation early from both her parents and the rugged landscape. In 1971, she achieved a Bachelor of Science in botany at University of Otago and went on to complete a postgraduate diploma in landscape architecture at Lincoln College. She initially worked for the Ministry of Works and Development, but resigned during the Robert Muldoon era saying she could not work under a government whose policies adversely affected New Zealand’s biodiversity and natural rural landscapes. She set up a practice in Geraldine advising rural landowners on sustainable management, and is the director of Lucas Associates Limited, now based in Christchurch. For decades, her projects and publications have informed and improved urban design, native plantings, waterway restoration, Resource Management Act (RMA) planning, forestry and high country management. Her many professional and voluntary roles include time with the Natural Heritage Fund, the Department of Conservation, the New Zealand Conservation Authority, the New Zealand Environmental Council, Ngā Whenua Rāhui (a fund that assists Māori Land owners with protection of indigenous ecosystems), the New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects (NZILA), Federated Farmers, the New Zealand Farm Forestry Association, and the Christchurch City Council Urban Design Panel. She has also served as president of NZILA, a commissioner at RMA hearings, and judge for the Canterbury Heritage Awards. From 1995 to 1997, she researched native plant species suitable for home gardeners to grow in their neighbourhood. Together with the Christchurch-Otautahi Agenda 21 committee, she published her research in a set of four booklets on several different areas, entitled Indigenous Ecosystems of Otautahi Christchurch. The booklets include a street map of Christchurch overlaid on a map of the Canterbury Plains ecosystems and soil types. The ecosystems range from old wetlands to forest, through to younger tussock grasslands. In addition, the booklets provide a guide for nurseries and the public about which native trees, shrubs, climbers and groundcovers naturally belong in different areas. At the time of the Christchurch earthquakes, she warned that old streams have 'memories'. A map of the city drawn up in 1850 showed a number of old waterways that had since been filled in with gravel and built on. Many badly earthquake damaged buildings were sited on top of these old streams.

He is the spiritual uncle of the Buddha and gave him a high position on heaven as a guardian deity of the Vulture Peak. His origins are said to derive from an Indian bird god Garuda. Peng is one of the 8 demi-gods of Buddhism (Tian Long Ba Bu) and helps to guard Mount Sumeru and Trāyastriṃśa from being attacked by the Asuras. Peng is appearances in Chinese ancient literature Journey to the West (西游記), General Yue Fei (Shuo Yue quan zhuan, 說岳全傳) and also mentioned in some Chinese buddhism literature. Legends Golden Winged Great Peng statue in the Hongwu temple According to legend, during the primordial times, the original Phoenix (Fenghuang), the leader of flying beings, gave birth to the peacock Mahamayuri and the eagle Golden Winged Great Peng. The peacock once consumed the Buddha, who however managed to escape via cut her stomach. The Buddha intended to kill the peacock, however the deities told him to stop, thus the Buddha promoted her to be his godmother, therefore the eagle would be his uncle and gave the eagle a high position on heaven. Peng sits at the head of the Buddha's throne in the Western Paradise. His fiery temper is aroused when a bat-spirit (the embodiment of the Aquarius constellation) passes gas during the Enlightened One's sermon on the Lotus Sutra. He swoops down from the throne and snatches her up in his beak, killing her instantly. The Buddha admonishes the bird for his transgression of Buddhist law and exiles him to earth. His rebirth in the human world actually serves to counterbalance the actions of a nomadic antagonist. Journey to the West The battle of Buddha and Golden Winged Great Peng Peng is an antagonist of the 16th-century Chinese classic novel Journey to the West. He is a demonic eagle who was born from the primordial Phoenix. The Buddha gave the Eagle a high position on Heaven and unfortunately only serves to fuel his big ego. For unknown reason, the Eagle transformed himself into a humanoid form, the Golden Winged Great Peng, ate all the residents of the Lion Camel Kingdom, ruled it for 500 years, and befriend the Azure Lion Demon and the Yellow Toothed Elephant Demon to eat Tang Sanzang. His powers and position of being technically the uncle of the Buddha fuels his big ego as he considers himself above everyone else. He is armed with a ji and capable of flying over great distances. He possesses a Flask of Yin and Yang Essence (陰陽二氣瓶) which can suck in unsuspecting victims. Peng set up several plans to capture Tang Sanzang and his companions and even successfully captured Sun Wukong himself. After numerous humiliating failures under the hand of the three demon kings, Wukong met the Buddha for help and learned about the backstory of Peng. After a battle between Wukong and the three demons, both the Lion and the Elephant are forced to revert to their original forms, and the Buddha shows up to subdue Peng and take him back to Vulture Peak. After his defeat at the hand of the Buddha, Peng admits that he enjoys his life as a demon and eating humans, though after listening to the Buddha, Peng has no choice but abandoned his evil goals and redeemed himself in the process. After some struggle, the bird agrees to become a protector of Buddhist law. Much later, when Sanzang and his companion received the scriptures, the Buddha, knew that those are the scriptures with no text, orders the Eagle to chase them and took the fake scriptures. The Eagle did this right away. Thus, Chinese fiction portrays Peng as a powerful demon king that submits to the Buddha and perches above his throne as a hot-tempered guardian deity. Shurangama Mantra  The Shurangama Mantra is a dhāraṇī or long mantra of Buddhist practice in China, Japan and Korea. The 302nd line of the mantra is pertains to the great golden-winged peng bird, the garuda, and its retinue. Its retinue includes all species of birds. They are all governed by the great golden-winged peng bird, who is the king among birds. The peng bird feasts exclusively on dragons. His wing-span measures an astounding 330 yojanas. When he flaps his wings, the waters of the sea part clear to the deepest seabed. Overview A literary motif appearing in Journey to the West and The Story of Yue Fei depicts the bird deity Peng as a demon-turned- Buddhist guardian who sits above the Buddha's throne. The Ming dynasty examples suggest Peng was considered a common element of the Buddha's enlightenment torana. The bird god is in effect a guardian of the faith who watches over the world from an exalted position high atop the Buddha's throne.

They came to power in the Indies through their alliance with the Dutch East India Company in the 18th century. Originally from Lasem in Central Java, they figured prominently in the consolidation of Dutch rule in East Java and maintained a long tradition of government service as Kapitan Cina and priyayi in the Dutch colonial brueaucracy. Founding and history of the family The family is descended from Han Siong Kong (1673-1743), who migrated to Lasem from Zhangzhou, Fujian, Qing Empire; and from the 12th-century Chinese mandarin Han Hong. Their first attested ancestor, the 7th-century military leader Han Zhaode, was a general in the army of the warlord Chen Yuanguang (657–711) who pacified Fujian for the Tang dynasty. Han Chan Piet, Majoor der Chinezen (1759 – 1827) Two of Han Siong Kong's sons, by a daughter of the regent of Rajegwesi according to J. Hageman, played a prominent role in consolidating Dutch rule in East Java in the 18th century. The elder, Soero Pernollo (1720 – 1776), converted to Islam, and served the Dutch East India Company as police chief, harbourmaster of Surabaya and bureaucrat. The younger, Han Bwee Kong (1727 – 1778), became the earliest recorded Dutch-appointed Kapitein der Chinezen, or head of the Chinese community, of Surabaya. The family reached the peak of their power in the late 18th and early 19th century, in particular during the Interregnum. Allied with Herman Willem Daendels, the Napoleonic governor-general of the Dutch East Indies, the grandsons of Han Siong Kong ruled much of the Eastern Salient of Java as landlords, Chinese officers and regents. One of the grandsons, Han Chan Piet, Majoor der Chinezen (1759 – 1827) purchased from Daendels the districts of Besuki and Panarukan in 1810, while his younger brother, Majoor Han Kik Ko (1766–1813), acquired the district of Probolinggo later that same year. Their cousins from the Muslim branch of the family, Adipati Soero Adinegoro (1752–1833) and Raden Soero Adiwikromo, ruled vast territories as part of the Javanese bureaucracy. H. H. Kan, early 20th century In 1813, however, a revolt — the so-called 'Kepruk Cina' — broke out against the family that led to the government's eventual reacquisition of the most important Han domains. This was followed in 1818 by a purge of nearly all Muslim members of the Han family from the colonial bureaucracy. Nonetheless, the family managed to reestablish their power base, and remained influential as landowners and in public administrators in Surabaya and East Java until the Indonesian revolution (1945—1950). Indeed, in Han Tjiong Khing (1866—1933), the family provided Surabaya with its last Majoor der Chinezen. Beyond East Java, prominent branches were also established in Batavia, Semarang and Aceh in the second half of the nineteenth century. The prominent politician Hok Hoei Kan (1881—1951), member of the Volksraad, chair of Chung Hwa Hui (CHH) and community leader, belonged through his father to the Batavia branch of the family. Kan's distant cousin, parliamentary and CHH colleague Han Tiauw Tjong belonged to the Aceh branch of the family.

Background Bogosian wished to make a film about Soghomon Tehlirian and so started a screenplay; this evolved into a book and he researched the wider Operation Nemesis for seven years. Bogosian had initially believed that Tehlirian's killing of Talaat Pasha in 1921 was an urban legend. The author stated that the book production process had \\"radicalized\\" him in favor of ethnic Armenian political positions while previously he held a \\"pragmatic\\" point of view. Contents The first part discusses the history of Armenia and the Armenian Genocide. The second part of the book discusses Operation Nemesis itself, including a biography of the assassin, the death of Talaat, and what occurred afterwards. Part three discusses the involvement of intelligence agencies in the operation, as well as the other Operation Nemesis acts and what happened afterwards. The bibliography and endnotes take up about 50 pages. Aram Kouyoumdjian of Horizon Weekly described the book as \\"factually driven\\" but also \\"a fast-paced, tension-filled, and altogether accessible work\\", and that it involved \\"complex geopolitics\\". Rupen Janbazian stated in the Armenian Weekly that the book, unlike many other English-language works, discusses the involvement of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) and how it purposefully used the assassinations to spread awareness of the genocide. Joseph Kanon of The New York Times stated that because assassinations to right wrongs can turn into terrorist movements, \\"To his great credit, Bogosian [...] refuses to portray Tehlirian or any of the other members of his group as heroes.\\" Reception Kanon praised the book's \\"gripping action accounts of Nemesis at work, and in the sober assessment of its terrible aftermath.\\" Kanon criticized the \\"historical narration\\" as he felt it sometimes goes into tangents and parts feel unnecessary. Janbazian wrote praise of the book and supported the level of historical detail in the book because \\"most readers do not have a sufficient understanding of Armenian history.\\" Kouyoumdjian wrote that the book had \\"rigorous scholarly research\\" despite the author not having an academic background. Kirkus Reviews stated that the book is \\"Difficult reading, but an extremely well-written political statement about Turkey—not just then, but as it is now.\\" \\\\- Review date: February 1, 2015. Publishers Weekly stated that for readers unfamiliar with the subject it \\"is a highly readable introduction\\" while for readers who have familiarity \\"Bogosian has uncovered a little-known aspect of it in fascinating detail.\\" References External links * Operation Nemesis official website * Operation Nemesis by Little Brown * - At YouTube Category:2015 non-fiction books Category:History books about the Armenian Genocide ","title":"Operation Nemesis (book)"},{"id":"61046861","text":"The Lodi Street-Prairie Street Historic District is located in Lodi, Wisconsin.

It is the clan temple of the Takeda clan, noted Sengoku period warlords and rulers of Kai Province from the Muromachi period. Its main image is a statue of Shaka Nyōrai. History The temple founded in 1380 by Nikaidō Sadafuji, the shugo of Kai Province, who invited the noted Zen prelate Musō Soseki from Kanagawa to build a hermitage on his property. Due to the fame of Musō Soseki, it became the center for the dissemination of Rinzai teachings in Kao Province, and was name one of the Kantō Jissetsu by Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu. However, the temple fell into ruin during the Onin War. It was revived in the Sengoku period by Takeda Harunobu in 1541. Takeda Shingen made Kaisen Joki head priest in 1564. In 1582, Kai Province was invaded by an alliance between Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu. Eirin-ji was accused of sheltering Rokkaku Yoshisuke (a former enemy of the Oda), and the temple was completely destroyed. After Tokugawa Ieyasu became master of Kai Province, he ordered that the temple be rebuilt and in 1672, memorial services for Takeda Shingen were held. The temple continued to honor its connection with the Takeda clan through the Edo period and even after the Meiji restoration. Most of the Edo period structures were lost in a fire of 1905. Cultural properties =Important cultural properties= Erin-ji Gate The is a wooden gate with four pillars and a cypress-shingle roof, built in 1606. It is the oldest remaining structures of the temple.

The type flew from the aircraft carrier and shore bases. A total of 32 Trackers were purchased in two batches which were delivered in 1967 and 1977. An order for 14 S-2E Tracker operational aircraft and two S-2A ground trainers was placed in 1964 as part of a project to reinvigorate the Navy's aviation capability. The aircraft were delivered in 1967 and began to enter service the next year. They proved successful in their intended role, and were also used for land-based patrols. They did not see combat, but operated from Melbourne across the Pacific region during training exercises and patrols. All but three of the S-2Es were destroyed by a deliberately lit fire in December 1976, and 16 S-2G Trackers were rapidly acquired to replace them. These aircraft entered service in 1977 and undertook the same tasks as the S-2Es. After Melbourne was decommissioned without replacement in 1982 the Government decided to dispose of the Trackers, and most of the fleet was sold in 1984. Acquisition During the late 1950s the Australian Government and Royal Australian Navy (RAN) considered options to replace the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne, and her air group. While Melbourne had only been commissioned in 1955, the de Havilland Sea Venom fighters and Fairey Gannet maritime patrol aircraft operated by the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) were becoming obsolete. It was believed that Melbourne was too small to operate more modern aircraft types, and the RAN investigated options to buy a larger carrier. The Government judged that the cost of a new aircraft carrier was too high, especially given the expense of the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force's (RAAF's) procurement programs at that time, and in November 1959 it was announced that the FAA would cease to operate fixed- wing aircraft in 1963. A United States Navy S2E Tracker operating from HMAS Melbourne in April 1962 as part of trials to determine the suitability of the type for Australian service As a result of intervention by the Minister for the Navy, Senator John Gorton, the Government eventually agreed to purchase new fixed-wing aircraft. Gorton had served as a fighter pilot in World War II and had a strong interest in his portfolio. In 1961 Gorton convinced the Cabinet to fund a program to reinvigorate the FAA, starting with the purchase of 27 Westland Wessex anti-submarine helicopters. At this time it was planned to retain Melbourne as a helicopter carrier, but in mid-1963 the Government gave the Navy permission to retain the Sea Venoms and Gannets in service until at least 1967. Minister for Defence Senator Shane Paltridge rejected a proposal from the Navy to purchase an Essex-class aircraft carrier from the United States Navy in June 1964, and the next month Melbourne undertook flight trials with Douglas A-4 Skyhawk fighters and Grumman S-2 Tracker anti- submarine aircraft during a visit to U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay in the Philippines. American Trackers had previously operated from Melbourne in 1957 and several other occasions. The July 1964 trials proved that Melbourne could safely operate both types without the need for major modifications. In November 1964 Cabinet considered a proposal to modernise Melbourne and purchase 18 Skyhawks and 16 Trackers. It decided against acquiring Skyhawks, but agreed to the remainder of the project. Following further lobbying and staff work by the Navy, the Government eventually agreed to also purchase ten A-4G Skyhawks in early 1965. The cost of the Tracker acquisition was $A16.4 million. The Tracker order comprised 14 of the S-2E model, which were intended for operational service, and two former US Navy S-2A variants which were to be used as non-flying training aids and instructional airframes. The S-2E Tracker was a twin-engined aircraft with a crew of four. It could be armed with two homing torpedoes, two depth bombs or four depth charges within its weapons bay. Additional bombs or rockets could be mounted on its wings. The aircraft had a maximum range of and could stay aloft for up to nine hours. Its sensors included a AN/APS 39 radar and a magnetic anomaly detector, which extended from the belly and tail of the aircraft respectively. They could also carry sonobuoys to track submarines. Trackers had first entered service with the US Navy in 1954, and 1,285 were eventually produced. Preparations Members of 851 Squadron with a S-2E Tracker in 1968 RAN personnel were trained to operate Trackers in North America during 1966 and 1967. The first RAN pilots to quality on the type were trained in Canada. Other pilots received training on the type at a US Navy facility at Corpus Christi, Texas. A detachment of maintenance personnel began a training program in the United States during mid-1966 and completed it late the next year. The RAN decided to use a different flight-deck crew composition for its Trackers than the US Navy and Royal Canadian Navy. Both of these navies crewed their Trackers with a pilot as well as a co-pilot who doubled as the tactical coordinator (TACCO). As the RAN had a large number of highly experienced observers who had served on board Gannets, it decided to employ a single pilot and an observer who also served as the TACCO. This reduced the efficiency of the RAN's Trackers and increased the risk of accidents due to pilot fatigue. The other two members of the aircraft's crew were an observer and an air crewman. Melbourne travelled to the United States to pick up her new aircraft in late 1967, and returned to Sydney with them on 22 November that year. They were offloaded and transported by road to Mascot Airport. After receiving mechanical checks and test flights, the Trackers flew to HMAS Albatross, the Navy's air base, later that year. Melbourne commenced a refit to prepare her to operate the Skyhawks and Trackers. The Trackers were allocated to two flying squadrons. 816 Squadron was the primary operator, and flew the aircraft from Melbourne. 851 Squadron used Trackers for training purposes. 816 Squadron recommissioned with the type on 10 January 1968, followed by 851 Squadron on 2 September that year. After Melbournes refit was complete and the two squadrons had completed flight training, test flights of the S-2Es from the carrier began in March 1969. Landing was considered challenging, as there was only a gap between the Tracker's right wing and Melbournes island when aircraft landed on the right- hand side of the centreline. The trials proved successful, and the type was certified for operations from Melbourne. The RAN also acquired a Tracker Weapons Systems Trainer to support the aircraft. This system was delivered in 1967, and was initially installed in a pair of trailers; one trailer carried cockpit and instrument consoles and the other a computer, electronics and a workshop. The Tracker Weapons Systems Trainer was badly damaged by a fire started in a tea urn before it entered service, and had to be sent back to the United States for repairs. After these were complete, the system was installed in a building at HMAS Albatross. Operational service =S-2E Tracker= Melbournes first deployment with her new air group commenced in May 1969. During an exercise conducted in this deployment, Skyhawks flying from the carrier made a simulated attack on an \\"enemy\\" force which had first been detected by Trackers. 816 Squadron regularly operated from Melbourne throughout the early 1970s, and the Trackers proved successful in the anti- submarine role. During this period the aircraft carrier frequently made deployments across the Pacific. It was found that the Trackers could handle the same tasks as the RAAF's larger Lockheed P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft, though the Trackers had shorter range and could not carry as many weapons. The aircraft's engines also proved to be extremely reliable. The view from the cockpit of a Tracker preparing to land on HMAS Melbourne On 10 February 1975 Tracker 853 was destroyed when one of Melbournes arrester wires snapped when it landed, causing the aircraft to continue down its flight deck and crash into the sea. All four members of the crew were rescued. This was the only loss of a RAN Tracker during flying operations. Trackers also conducted fisheries protection patrols from 1975. This task began on 6 March that year, when three Trackers from 851 Squadron began what was intended as a one-month operation from Broome, Western Australia. The Trackers proved successful in this role, and the flights were extended. 816 Squadron began flying them in May 1975, and responsibility for land-based maritime patrols was exchanged between the two squadrons until December 1980. After this time a civilian company conducted the patrols. The detachment moved to Darwin, Northern Territory at a date not specified in the sources. Disaster struck the S-2E fleet on the evening of 4 December 1976. A disaffected member of one of the Tracker squadrons set fire to the hangar at HMAS Albatross in which all but one of the aircraft had been placed in storage for the Christmas period; the remaining aircraft was under maintenance at Bankstown Airport. Despite very dangerous conditions, RAN personnel attempted to fight the fire and move aircraft from the hangar. These efforts were largely unsuccessful, and nine aircraft were destroyed or damaged beyond repair. The other three aircraft were damaged, of which only two were ever repaired. The 19-year old sailor responsible admitted to starting the fire. At his court martial he was found to have not been responsible for his actions due to mental illness. =S-2G Tracker= Tracker 845 being prepared for launch in 1980 The RAN was able to rapidly rebuild its Tracker fleet. An order for six ex-US Navy S-2G Trackers had been placed in October 1976 to modernise the force. This order was increased to sixteen S-2Gs soon after the fire. The US Government sold the aircraft at a discount of 97 percent of their value, and allowed a RAN team to select airframes from US Navy stores shortly after the order was placed. The US Navy also donated spare parts to Australia. The aircraft were refurbished and then flown to San Diego, where in March 1977 they were loaded onto Melbourne. The aircraft entered service shortly afterwards. The S-2Gs' performance and features were similar to the S-2Es. Their sonic systems were upgraded during 1977 and 1978 to enable the use of more advanced sonobuoys. In 1978 Hawker de Havilland approached the Navy with a proposal to upgrade several of the Trackers' surveillance systems at a cost of between $1 and $1.5 million per aircraft. This proposal was rejected. In mid-1977 Melbourne travelled to the United Kingdom with 816 Squadron aircraft embarked to participate in a fleet review organised to mark the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The ageing carrier took part in regular training exercises for the rest of the 1970s. Following an accident on 21 October 1980 in which a Skyhawk was destroyed due to a malfunction in Melbournes catapult, Trackers were the only fixed-wing aircraft to operate from the carrier for the remainder of its career. From November 1977 land-based Tracker patrols were expanded. The detachment at Darwin began conducting patrols to locate boats carrying refugees escaping from Vietnam. In 1980, the type also began to be used for anti-terrorism patrols around oil rigs in the Bass Strait. The later task continued until 31 December 1983. Melbourne completed its final deployment in November 1981, and was decommissioned in June the next year. 816 Squadron was merged into 851 Squadron on 2 July 1982. 851 Squadron continued to use Trackers for maritime patrol tasks while the Government considered whether to purchase a new aircraft carrier or offer the aircraft for sale. It was eventually decided to not replace the carrier and sell the Trackers, and they were last flown in RAN service in December 1983. The Trackers were officially withdrawn from service in June 1984. The RAN's next dedicated anti- submarine and surveillance aircraft were Sikorsky S-70B-2 Seahawk helicopters. These helicopters began to enter service in 1988 and were operated from frigates. All but two of the aircraft were subsequently sold to the United Aeronautical Corporation. The other aircraft were retained in Australia. Tracker 859 is preserved at the Fleet Air Arm Museum and the airworthy 844 was relocated to the HARS Aviation Museum in September 2019. Several other ex-RAN Trackers had been preserved in Australia or were in storage in the United States as of 2019.

It is the primary venue of the New Clark City Sports Hub which is part of the National Government Administrative Center. It hosted the athletics events and the closing ceremony of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games. Construction The construction of the whole New Clark City Sports Hub, which also includes the Athletics Stadium, began on April 25, 2018 with a cement-pouring ceremony. The cost of the stadium including the nearby training track oval and a field for throwing sports costed around . By early July 2019, the stadium is already 98 percent complete and the track oval is already available for use to Filipino athletes. With the stadium almost complete by September 1, 2019, the first event held in the stadium was the final leg of the Philippine Athletics Track and Field Association weekly relay, a qualifier for athletes aspiring to represent the Philippines at the 2019 Southeast Asian Games, on that day. The construction of the stadium was finished on October 12, 2019, or 50 days ahead of the opening of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games. Architecture and design Local architecture firm, Budji + Royal Architecture + Design, were commissioned by the Bases Conversion Development Authority to work on the New Clark City Sports Hub. This also marks the first time that Budji + Royal Architecture + Design worked on a sports facility project and the first team involved in the project referred to the technical guidelines set by the International Association of Athletics Federations for the athletics stadium. The Athletics Stadium itself had its design was derived from Mount Pinatubo, with its posts and facade made from lahar or volcanic debris from the volcano. Its ringed roofline was made to resemble a crater and be defined by a series of curving canopies. The main facade or the main entrance was ornated with glassframes. and its pillars are painted orange to represent the local sunset. The shade of the anti-corrosive paint, provided by Norwegian firm Jotun, is patented and is branded as \\"B+R Active Orange\\". The pillars, inspired from the framework of the parol, supports the seating structure of the stadium as well as its roofing. The stadium has an open-shed architecture and a raised roofline as a remedy against the tropical and humid climate of its locale. The structure is further ventilated by wind tunnels and its insulated oval roof. There are no pillars obstructing the view towards the center of the stadium from its seating area with lights hung at the catwalk of its canopy. Lead architect Royal Pineda describe the result of the approach in designing the stadium and the rest of the sports complex as a \\"practical luxury\\" or a deviation from relying on expensive materials to come up with an elegant result. The open ceiling allows the installation of additional utilities without dismantling the stadium's ceiling board or doing any repainting works. The structural frames and lahar concrete were deliberately left unpainted for easy maintenance. The stadium and surrounding facilities are also engineered to resist earthquakes of up to 8.9 magnitude. The concept of \\"practical luxury\\" is also described as maximizing the facility's usable space. The stadium was nominated for the Jury Award of Stadium of the Year 2019 of StadiumDB.com, an online database for stadiums. The New Clark City stadium is among the ten shortlisted stadiums being considered for the award. Facilities Interior of the stadium The stadium which sits on a footprint of has a seating capacity for 20,000 people and has 21 rows of seats. It is graded as a Class 1A Athletics Facility certified by the International Association of Athletics Federations, the first athletics facility in the Philippines to be so. The stadium also hosts a nine-lane standard athletics oval The rubberized track was provided by Polytan. The stadium also has radio receivers installed that would allow the measuring of athletes performing in the venue through RFID timing.

The phrase originated from Saint Jerome who wrote in four letters to embrace a life in the mold of Jesus of Nazareth—a life of poverty and humility—and to embrace a life like a man naked, following the \\"naked Christ\\" or the \\"naked cross.\\" History The phrase originated and was popularized by Eusebius Sophronius Hieronymus—known best as Saint Jerome—who wrote in four of his letters to embrace poverty, humility, and a life divorced from worldly desires. To further illustrate this point, Jerome offers the image of a man stripping himself naked to follow the \\"naked Christ\\" or the \\"naked cross.\\" The phrase draws on the encounter Jesus of Nazareth had with the rich man in the synoptic Gospels: > The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: > what lack I yet? Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell > that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in > heaven: and come and follow me. (Gospel of Matthew 19.20-21, King James > Version; cf. 16.24; see Mark 10.17-31, Luke 18.18-30) The recommended following of \\"the naked crucified Christ\\" was integral to the larger and quintessential characteristics of Franciscan spirituality: a heartfelt contemplation of the poor, and of the suffering humanity of Jesus. The humanization of Jesus has endured in many forms of art, poetry, and traditions within Christianity, such as presepio and Stations of the CrossFranco Mormando, \\"'Nudus nudum Christum sequi': The Franciscans and Differing Interpretations of Male Nakedness in Fifteenth-Century Italy,\\" Fifteenth-Century Studies, 2008, vol. 33, pp. 171-97.  Criticism and reception  In 1983, Leo Steinberg, a Russian-born American art critic, wrote The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion as a blunt overlook of how many depictions of Jesus and his genitalia are \\"indisputably a central thematic concern.\\" He first argues: > The first necessity is to admit a long-suppressed matter of fact: that > Renaissance art, both north and south of the Alps, produced a large body of > devotional images in which the genitalia of the Christ Child, or of the dead > Christ, receive such demonstrative emphasis that one must recognize an > ostentatio genitalium comparable to the canonic ostentatio vulnerum, the > showing forth of the wounds. In the book, he additionally attempts to find \\"theological grounds\\" for this concern to depict the teacher naked, which he sees as the embodiment of the doctrine of the Incarnation, showing that Jesus was linked with the great chain of human procreation – even though divinely perfect. This is in part due to the pattern of drawing the emphases of nudity in paintings depicting Jesus in the beginning and end of his life—the Word of God made Flesh (see Gospel of John 1.1).

Early life  Preston was first exposed to comic books at age eight and was immediately drawn to the visuals. At age 13, Preston was reintroduced to comics by a friend and from that point on he was hooked. For college, Preston enrolled at UNLV for his first two years as a Fine Arts major, thinking he wanted to be an Illustrator, but really his desire was to be comic book artist. An instructor's advice that Preston seek out a more serious art school, with commercial sensibilities led him to enroll in Community College for Graphic Design. Preston bought his first camera, an Olympus OM-1, during that third year of studies, to shoot reference photos for his illustrations, and found his passion. After graduating with a degree in Graphic Design, Preston then moved to LA to study photography at Art Center College of Design. In school, Preston began shooting with Nikon and Hasselblad cameras; and his favorite photographer influences were Richard Avedon, Irving Penn, Albert Watson, Mark Seliger, and Andrew Eccles. Preston met Sharon Sampsel at Art Center, graduating in 1986, and the couple married the same year.  Career  Preston would go on to find work as commercial advertising photographer, specializing in Hotel, Resort, Hospitality, Weddings, Portrait, Editorial, Food, and Architectural photography. Preston and his wife opened their Las Vegas based photography studio, Sampsel Preston Photography, on April 1, 1988. Preston's love of the illustration & fantasy art and a suggestion from cartoonist Scott Shaw brought about the idea for Preston's project of portraits of artists within their studios. The 15-year long project brought together 101 cartoonists, comic book artists, and animators into an award- winning book of black and white portraits of such luminaries as Frank Miller, Al Hirschfeld, Joe Barbera, Jack Kirby, Joe Simon, Moebius, Walt and Louise Simonson, and many more. The Artist Within: Portraits of Cartoonists, Comic Book Artists, Animators and Others was published by Dark Horse Books in 2007. After the success of his first book, Preston crowdfunded the companion book. Launched in March 2017, the Kickstarter campaign received funding of $30,624. The Artist Within: Behind the Lines: Book 2 was published in November 2017, and features both black and white and color portraits of more than one hundred artists such as Drew Struzan, Jack Kirby, Mark English, Keith Knight, Syd Mead, Steranko, Ron English, Glen Keane and many more. Preston's portraits from The Artist Within project have been seen during the Academy Awards & Eisner Awards. Preston's The Artist Within portrait of artist Marie Severin was used by publications such as The Atlantic, The Washington Post, and NewsDay to announce her passing. In past years, Preston has also been the official portrait photographer at such events as Spectrum Fantastic Art Live in Kansas City and CTN Animation Expo in Burbank, CA, setting up a pop-up studio to take portraits of the guest artists in attendance. Preston has been an invited speaker at various venues. In 2011 he was a guest speaker the Society of Wedding and Portrait Photographers convention in London, to speak about being a hotel and resort photographer. He has also spoken about his The Artist Within project before audiences at CTN Animation Expo, Loyola Marymount University, and at Art Center College of Design.

In the book, Moretti examines the concept of the bourgeois as it has developed in European literature. Reception Valerie Sanders, writing about The Bourgeois in Times Higher Education, described the book as follows: \\"Moretti’s purpose, in this short, epigrammatic study of a class that sits awkwardly in the power structure it supposedly influences, is to examine the bourgeois 'refracted through the prism of literature.' His contention, by the end, is that after industrialisation the class bifurcates into two ideal types, 'the good Bürger' and the 'creative destroyer,' irreconcilable in their values.\\" John Plotz, reviewing The Bourgeois in Victorian Studies, found some weaknesses in Moretti's approach: \\"This functionalist credo lies at the core of The Bourgeois: Moretti presumes that we can say what a text is by saying what it did to the society on which it was initially unleashed. It is a reading strategy that reveals much but that can also overlook some synchronic interpretive frameworks, and understate the diachronic afterlives of texts that are not totally defined by that site of original production.\\" However, despite those misgivings, Plotz saw Moretti's book as having immense value, stating that Moretti's \\"insights become crucial ways of locating important resemblances between novels that share similar strategies despite their surface discrepancies. Taken all in all, there’s no scholar around I’m more eager to read, nobody by whom I’m more provoked and inspired.\\" Michael Adam Carroll in Romance Quarterly concluded that Moretti's book was an excellent one: \\"Moretti writes an excellent survey that begins to tie together two centuries of literature and its social influences.... Moretti applies a critical eye to literature, supported by a keen understanding of social critique, answering scholars’ recent call to fill the gap left between humanistic and structuralist approaches.\\" Stephen E. Roulac, reviewing The Bourgeois in the New York Journal of Books, applauded the book: \\"Franco Moretti offers a rewarding, thought provoking, mind expanding excursion through evolving social order of recent times. A highly personalized partisan essay, with no encyclopedic ambitions, The Bourgeois is an informed, engaging, entertaining, exploration of how capitalism created and then destroyed the 'middle state' of society.\\" References Sources  Category:2013 non-fiction books Category:English-language books Category:Books of literary criticism Category:Verso Books books ","title":"The Bourgeois"},{"id":"61047279","text":"Sophia Sergio (born 16 February 1992) is an Italian beauty pageant titleholder who was crowned Miss Universo Italia 2016 and represented Italy in Miss Universe 2016 in Manila, Philippines.

She said, \\"We have a large LGBT community in Goa, but most prefer to stay under the scanner since it is a very small place and everyone knows each other. However, we are trying to create more awareness now.\\" Chris Fernandes (CEO & Founder of Goa Rainbow Trust), who came out in the open about her sexuality and is proud of it, founded Adhikar to help girls dealing with similar issues in the state. “Among the LGBT, lesbians are the most closeted. Parents force them to get married and when there’s a child involved it gets more complicated,” she said, adding that she comes across a number of school and college going youth who are looking for someone to talk to.

The place that they took a rest was called \\"Bang Ratklao\\" (บางรัดเกล้า; \\"a place where a tiara was taken off\\") and is later changed to \\"Bang Kachao\\" as today. Lord Uthong commanded his soldiers to tie a rope and made a raft to cross the Chao Phraya River. While he was making his way across the river, cholera was rapidly chasing him by climbing the rope. He decided to cut the rope to get rid of cholera. The Lord and his wife settled down at a village for long time so that area was name \\"Chong Nang Ni\\" (ช่องนางหนี; \\"a channel that lady escaped\\"). It is later called \\"Chong Nonsi\\" finally. Or another folklore, this is a story of an original name of Wat Chong Nonsi. There was a Myanmar lady who escaped from the army invading Ayutthaya. She secretly hid herself in a Buddhist temple and survived. As a result, people called this temple \\"Wat Nang Ni\\" (a temple where a lady hid herself). It is later called \\"Wat Chong Nonsi\\".\\"ความเป็นมา ๑๐๐ ปี ของเขตยานนาวา\\" (\\"100 Years of Yan Nawa District\\") (Free pamphlet) Places of interest *CentralPlaza Rama III *The UP Rama3 *Wat Chong Nonsi *Wat Chong Lom *Wat Pho Man Khunaram *Goods and Imitation Goods Museum *Tentacles *Mae Nam Railway Station References Category:Yan Nawa District Category:Subdistricts of Bangkok Category:Populated places on the Chao Phraya River ","title":"Chong Nonsi"},{"id":"61047664","text":"Helmut Hagg (born 24 May 1932) is a German cross-country skier.

Synopsis The fast buck runs around a complexed set of events and interactions between different people out to find a hidden Indian treasure with different intentions, soon involving a ruthless criminal who is on the run after a homicide in an attempted robbery. Plot The story opens with hotelier Ralph Rico rendezvousing with acquaintance Verne Baird, a ruthless killer who has just knocked off actress Jean Bruce to steal her necklace, and wants Rico to sell it safely for him. Baird then runs for safety. Officer Olin shortly comes in and reveals that Jean Bruce has died and he strongly suspects Baird, but Rico denies any knowledge of the killer or the necklace. It is then shown that the Maharajah of Chittabad in India has come to claim a treasure of Indian jewels that his father had shipped to New York to donate to a museum long back, but was stolen and its whereabouts unknown, although the thief who attempted the robbery, Paul Hater, is serving a prison sentence due to finish in two years. The Rajah now wants the insurance company to make good the loss of the treasure, but the latter suspect that he is trying to exploit them by finding the treasure for himself and disposing it whilst making a false claim for insurance money, and have employed private investigator Harmon Purvis' agency to spy on him. Ed Dallas, sidekick to Purvis, spies on a couple visiting the Rajah and reports his findings to his boss. The couple are one Preston Kile from San Francisco and his companion Eve Gillis. Olin finds Baird and pursues him, but fate would have it, Baird lands up in the apartment of Anita Jackson, a waitress, who hides him from the police and nurses him to good health for days, much to Baird's surprise, in return for nothing at all. For some reason, Anita hates the police. Baird then gets time to prepare an alibi with friends in New York, and Olin is not able to pin the homicide-robbery on him. Baird develops a fascination for Anita and decides to meet her again. Next the plot moves to Preston Kile, a broke Stock exchange manipulator and roadside romeo, and Eve Gillis, an ex model, staying with him. She convinces him to agree to find the Rajah's treasure for the Rajah against all odds. But Eve is actually working in hand with her wayward brother Adam Gillis, both of whom wish to usurp the Rajah's prize money and then ditch Kile. Kile and Eve decide to 'kidnap' Hater from the Bellmore State Prison Farm and obtain the treasure whereabouts from him, as advised by Adam, and they meet Rico to find someone for this, who suggests Baird for a commission; the killer agrees to do the work for 10,000 dollars if he succeeds and 5000 even if he fails. Rico in the meantime gives the stolen necklace to Kile for safe disposal. Adam later scrutinises Kile's apartment secretly and notes this. Baird's movements are noted by Purvis' agents spying on everyone. Baird however notes this, and thinks there's more than meets the eye. He understands Kile's intention behind kidnapping Hater. Baird ends up brutally interrogating and killing Dallas' girlfriend Zoe Norton spying on him for Dallas' sake, and brutally wounds two of Purvis' detectives too. Baird is now on the run as he and Rico are seen fleeing by Dallas after killing Zoe, with a look out notice for him everywhere, and a helpless Rico, witness to his activities, is forced to run away with him, leaving behind his club and businesses. Baird sets off with Rico to kidnap Hater from the Red river swamps. They break away with Hater being brought to them by Baird's inside man Noddy, whom Baird kills when Noddy tries to double cross and kill the duo. Unfortunately lady luck does not smile on Baird and Rico anymore. An attack dog fatally bites Baird's left arm, and he takes ill soon after the bite with rapid sepsis, and the prison police soon catch up with them on the riverbank. Rico is shot in the ensuing scuffle and soon attacked and devoured by an alligator in the river. Baird decides to go to the Maharajah directly and deliver Hater. The plot now switches to Adam Gillis and his sister. Adam secretly watches Kile waiting for Baird at the pre decided location to receive Hater. He then anonymously calls the police and informs them that Kile has the missing necklace they're looking for, and Kile is arrested. He then proceeds to Eve's apartment, where it is revealed that Adam was all along in hand with the Chittabad Maharajah, and had planned the whole game with him. Adam had previously helped the Rajah in India, and the latter tasked him with finding his treasure by extracting information from Hater, in return for a job in India. Adam was only using Eve and Kile as stooges to get Hater out, should in case anything go wrong. But now that the plan has failed and Baird delivering Hater himself, Adam didn't need Kile anymore and got rid of him by tipping police about the necklace. Adam tells Eve to come with him to India to become the Rajah's concubine, to which an angry Eve flatly refuses. In anger Adam tries to kill his sister but is stopped by Dallas who appears on the scene, spying on him all the while. Dallas sends them both to hospital. The last phase and twist of the story moves to Baird. Slowly dying of gangrene and sepsis on route to meet the Maharajah, he forgets about the gagged and bound Hater with him, and by sheer will power, drives to Anita's apartment to meet her. Olin and Dallas with cops, and both question Anita. Hater is found dead of suffocation and injury in Baird's car already. At this point it is revealed by Anita that Hater was actually her father, and she was waiting for him all these years to return. Dallas sends Anita to meet the sick but armed Baird alone in her apartment. Anita tells Baird who actually Hater was, and Baird says he didn't mean to kill him. She also tells him at this point that there really is no treasure existent now because it was taken by her mother (Hater's wife) when Hater was arrested long back, abroad on a ship which sank with the treasure but her mother was saved and she moved on with life. Anita helped Baird because she dislikes police for what they did to Hater. Anita then leaves, and Olin and Dallas come in and confront Baird. A now remorseful Baird requests them not to charge Anita with initially sheltering him, and he dies. Olin decides to leave Anita out of the case. Prodded by Purvis, Dallas speaks to Anita and offers her money for any information about the treasure, but she flatly denies knowledge about it and walks away. The impressed Dallas offers to help Anita in future.

Early life and education  Hubert Reynolds was born on May 10, 1860 in South Amherst, Ohio to Lord Nelson Reynolds and June Reynolds, which where both natives of New York. He moved to Monroe, Michigan, when he was nine years old. He went to school there for nine years. Reynolds came to Colorado in January 1878 to work on a ranch near Fowler, Colorado which was, at the time, owned by his brother-in-law Burrell D. Smith. After Smith sold the ranch in the fall of 1882, Reynolds briefly lived in a mining camp in Leadville, Colorado. He then moved to Las Animas, Colorado and worked in a pharmacy there. In 1886, he decided to study pharmacy at Northwestern University in Chicago. Reynolds graduated in 1888 and resumed his position at the Las Animas pharmacy.  Professional life  In 1893, he opened a new pharmacy in Greeley, Colorado while he still hold a financial stake in the Las Animas pharmacy. He sold his pharmacy in Greeley and all his financial interests in other pharmacies in 1910. Later he invested in water stocks and ranches. He founded the commercial club of Greeley, which later became the local Chamber of Commerce. Reynolds was considered a leader of the local business community in Greeley.  Political career  Before moving to Greeley in 1893, Reynolds served one term as city alderman of Las Animas. In the 1910 elections, Reynolds ran for County assessor of Weld County on the Democratic ticket. He campaigned on his business experience. He lost that race to Republican A.R. Fischer by a 54-46 margin. In 1912, he was elected to represent Senate District 7 as a Democrat in the 19th Colorado General Assembly. At the time, the district contained all of Weld County. The Democrats achieved a 24-11 majority in the Colorado Senate in the 1912 elections. Therefore, Reynolds was able to chair the Senate Committee on Constitutional Amendments. Reynolds received an appointment by President Woodrow Wilson to serve as the postmaster in his hometown Greeley. He was recommended by Democratic Congressman Harry H. Seldomridge. Democratic Congressman George John Kindel unsuccessfully protested Reynolds' appointment in a letter to President Wilson. As a result of his appointment, Hubert Reynolds resigned his senate seat on September 1, 1913. = Greeley Post Office robbery = During Reynolds service as Postmaster, the Greeley Post Office saw a robbery on December 26, 1918. The robbers stole United States stamps valued at $69,300 (). At the time, this robbery was third largest robbery of a United States Post Office in history. The crime has not been solved and the perpetrators have never been identified. In accordance to the law at the time, Hubert Reynolds was personally liable for the loss. Losses over $10,000 () could only repaid to the respective postmaster if an act of the United States Congress allowed so. On November 4, 1921, the House of Representatives passed House Resolution (H.R.) 2003 \\"An Act For the relief of Hubert Reynolds\\" with 215-43 vote. In the Senate, the relief bill was delayed due to filibuster tactics. On September 22, 1922, Congress finally approved H. R. 2003, which relieved Reynolds of the liability and repaid him the $69,300. The Greeley Post Office had been robbed before, on the night of July 1, 1911. In that robbery stamps valued over $ 10,000 () were stolen. In reaction to the 1911 robbery, a new post office building, which opened in 1914, had been constructed.  Personal life  In 1889, Reynolds married Minule A. Culver who was the only daughter of a Las Animas family. His first wife died in Greeley on May 23, 1901. Reynolds married Mary M. Jones of Denver, who was a direct descendant of Daniel Boone, on June 3, 1903. Reynolds had four children, all born to his first wife Minule. Hubert Reynolds’ home was originally located at 1117 9th Avenue in Greeley. It has since been relocated to the City of Greeley’s Centennial Village Museum.

Since then Pride has happened in 2010 and then again in 2018. Hundreds of people from Bhubaneshwar, Cuttack and other parts of Odisha take to the streets to celebrate the city's LGBTQ+ Pride Parades.  History  = 2009 = Bhubaneswar's first queer Pride parade was held on 27 June 2009. It was jointly organised by Sakha, Institute for Development Programmes and Research (IDPR), and SAATHII. The event included keynote addresses by community members, government officials and NGO representatives, a documentary screening, street theatre performances, a public meeting at walk end-point; and concluded with a candle light vigil. = 2010 = On 3 July 2010, Bhubaneswar had its second Rainbow Pride walk that included a solidarity event and candlelight vigil. It was organised by Sampark, a coalition of community based organisations working on LGBTI and HIV issues. The event was covered by travel bloggers. = 2018 = 1 September 2018 marked the third time that the city of Bhubaneshwar witnessed a queer Pride parade. The 2018 Bhubaneshwar Pride was put together by three organisations – SAATHII, an NGO working for the cause of HIV-AIDS care and LGBTIQ rights, Sakha, which is run by Meera Parida and is an indigenous trans collective that has been supported by the Odisha government, and The Parichay Collective, an LGBQ community in Odisha. The Pride organisers said that a Pride march was essential to foster a spirit of community and visibility for the queer community in Odisha, where tier II cities like Bhubaneshwar did not display much awareness about the LGBTQ+ community. The focus of the Pride was not just visibility, but also intersectionality and inclusion. An organiser was quoted as saying, \\"This Pride will not only address the LGBTQIA problems but also the general constructs of the society like shame, untouchability, class bias and sex discrimination within and outside the community and the majority deciding what is best for minorities.\\" The 2018 Bhubaneshwar Pride also had the distinction of being the last Pride March in India that demanded the overhaul of Section 377 – the law criminalising \\"unnatural sex\\", as Section 377 was scrapped in a historic judgment by the Supreme Court of India just a few days later, on 6 September 2018.

Prelude  During the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August 1945, the 1st Far Eastern Front under Kirill Meretskov advance south along the coast of northern Korea. It was decided to conduct three amphibious landings in the rear of the Japanese Kwantung Army. From 11 to 13 August, the first two landings by the Pacific Fleet were executed, in which they occupied seaports Yuki (today Sonbong) and Racine (today Rason) on the Korean coast, which encountered only some small resistance in Racine. Encouraged by the success, the fleet commander, Admiral Ivan Yumashev ordered the launch of the next amphibious assault at the port of Seishin (now Chongjin). Unlike the previous ports, Seishin was well fortified and had a strong Japanese garrison. It had some 4,000 soldiers and was enforced by retreating units of the 3rd Japanese Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Keisaku Murakami of the Kwantung Army. In view of the successful development of the offensive of the 1st Far Eastern Front, the front commander, Marshal of the Soviet Union, Kirill Meretskov, on August 12 ordered to cancel the previously scheduled landing in Seishin. However, the fleet command continued preparations for the landing, hoping for an easy success. Yumashev managed to get permission to conduct the operation from the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet troops in the Far East, Marshal of the Soviet Union A. M. Vasilevsky. But, with the previous decision of Meretskov to cancel the operation, the fleet did not receive the rifle division previously planned for the landing in Seishin, and Yumashev was forced to go ahead with a limited number of troops, a brigade of marines and some individual units. To compensate for his small force, he ordered powerful pre-strikes of aviation and torpedo boats on the port (daily bomb-assault strikes from August 9 to 13). Nevertheless, the overall plan of the operation remained unchanged - preliminary landing of a reconnaissance group, and then building up the strength of the landing force. Since August 9, continuous air strikes were inflicted on the port of Seishin in which, according to Soviet data, about 10 Japanese ships were sunk. On August 12, some Soviet ships entered the harbour and established the absence of Japanese warships there. As a result, it was decided to start the operation, without waiting for the final completion of the battle in Racine and the redeployment of the light forces of the fleet there. Therefore, the starting point for the operation remained Vladivostok, significantly remote from Seishin, which immediately deprived the Soviet command of the ability to quickly respond to a changing situation.  Forces of the parties  The Soviets force was composed of 1 destroyer, 1 minelayer, 8 patrol ships, 7 minesweepers, 2 small hunter boats, 18 torpedo boats, 12 landing ships and 7 transports. For aviation support, 261 aircraft were allocated, 188 bombers and 73 fighters. The commander of the Naval forces was Captain First Rank A.F. Studenichnikov, and the commander of the landing party was Major General Vasily Trushin. The general command of the operation was in the hands of fleet commander Admiral I. S. Yumashev. The Japanese had an infantry battalion, an officer's school, and a naval base in the city. During the operation, the number of Japanese troops was increased with retreating units of the Kwantung Army — first 2 infantry regiments, then the Guards Infantry Division. The Japanese troops were led in battle by the commander of the Ranan fortified area, Lieutenant-General Munekichi Nishiwaki.  Operation  In the afternoon of August 13, 10 torpedo boats entered the port of Seishin, from which the 140th reconnaissance unit of the Pacific Fleet headquarters under the command of Lieutenant Viktor Leonov and a company of submachine gunners from the 13th Naval Infantry brigade (in total 181 men under command of Colonel A. Z. Denisin) entered the city. Leaving 2 boats for cover from the sea, the rest of the ships returned to Vladivostok. The assault force easily occupied the port and the surrounding urban areas, taking advantage of the enemy's complete surprise. However, the Japanese soon launched a counterattack, at first disorderly and fragmented. Quite quickly, the Japanese command restored order and launched an organized offensive against the landing force. The position of the scouts immediately deteriorated : they were cut off from the coast in an unfamiliar city and the Japanese also succeeded in cutting the detachment in two. By 18:30 pm, 7 more torpedo boats landed 90 more soldiers (a machine-gun company) away from the battlefield. This unit could not break through to join the reconnaissance detachment, suffered heavy losses and was forced to conduct a defensive battle. Thus, the situation for the Soviet landing force became critical and they were threatened with annihilation. Meanwhile, by the end of the day, the fleet commander sent 1 EK-2 sentry ship and 2 minesweepers from Vladivostok with the 355th separate battalion of marines on board, which could reach Seishin only the next day. Another major flaw was also revealed - aviation spotters were not included in the landing, so fleet aviation struck at a distance from the battlefield to avoid bombing its own troops. As such, direct air support for the landing was absent. During the night, the paratroopers fought an extremely fierce battle in three separate groups, beating off continuous counterattacks and soon lacking ammunition. In the morning of August 14, the detachment of ships that had left Vladivostok the previous day, reached Seishin and landed a battalion of marines (710 men under command of Major M.P. Barabolko). The battalion commander led his troops into the city and advanced 1-3 kilometers. However, by introducing fresh forces into battle and supported by the artillery fire of an armored train, the Japanese command pushed the paratroopers back to the port by the night of August 14, where they held a bridgehead 2 km along the front and 1 km deep. Only part of the battalion led a defensive battle at the piers, several more groups of soldiers were cut off from their unit and fought separately in high-rise buildings in the city. In addition, because of the lack of knowledge of the situation, the battalion had been landed too far away from all three advanced landing groups in the city and therefore could not unite with them. The critical situation persisted. A volunteer detachment (25 men, commander of the 3 rd rank GV Ternovsky) hastily formed from the crews of the ships, landed on the shore. During the night, the Soviets had to repel 14 enemy attacks. Only thanks to exceptional courage and a high level of combat training, the Marines managed to survive. The ships that arrived in the morning remained in the harbor and supported the troops with their artillery fire. Due to the bad weather on that day, aviation was practically not used in the operation (only 2 bombers could fly to Seishin, but they had little impact). The main detachment (23 ships) left Vladivostok with the 13th Marine Brigade aboard, and at night, also the destroyer Voikov and a tank landing barge with 7 T-26 tanks sailed for Seishin. At about 4 o'clock in the morning on August 15, the ships entered the port of Seishin and the main forces of the landing force (up to 5,000 men) began to disembark at the occupied bridgehead in the port under heavy enemy fire. The resistance of an ever-increasing adversary was so powerful that the launch of an entire brigade into battle did not lead to a turning point in the battle. Only in the middle of the day with the help of tanks and artillery fire from the ships that damaged the Japanese armored train, which was forced to leave the battlefield, the port was finally cleared from the enemy and the fighting began to take the city. By evening, the city was almost completely cleared of the Japanese, saving the surviving advanced groups of paratroopers. Stubborn fighting continued in the outskirts of the city. The commander, Lieutenant- General S. I. Kabanov, arrived at the port and assumed leadership of the operation. In the afternoon, another detachment of ships left Vladivostok (1 destroyer, 2 minesweepers, 3 transports, one patrol and border boat), carrying the third echelon of assault forces: 615 soldiers, 60 guns and mortars, 94 cars. Almost all the ships remained in the harbor and supported the offensive with artillery fire. The enemy tried to counteract them with fire from the still surviving coastal artillery and with attacks of individual aircraft. In the harbor of Seishin, a minesweeper was damaged by a US naval mine. On August 16, the third echelon of the landing force was landed in the port, while two more minesweepers were significantly damaged by mines. The fleet command, realizing that it had underestimated the enemy, was now fully building up the power of the landing force. At first, another tank landing barge with 7 T-26 tanks and 2 vehicles aboard was sent to Seishin. Then, the next detachment of ships, not initially planned, left Vladivostok : 1 patrol ship, 1 minesweeper, 6 landing craft, 1 tank landing ship, carrying the 205th infantry regiment and military equipment. During the day, the landing forces executed a limited offensive from Seishin towards the north and north-west. Japanese troops in the area of the city received a message about the order of the Emperor of Japan about the cessation of resistance. Although a number of units refused to lay down their arms, organized resistance had almost ceased by the end of the day. In some areas, the surrender of Japanese soldiers began. On August 17, the ships that had left Vladivostok the previous day, arrived at the port and the landing of the troops was carried out safely. There were small skirmishes and shootouts with individual groups and subunits of the enemy. The Japanese were taken prisoner, some of their units left the front and tried to go south overland. Around 11:30, a forward detachment of the 25th Army under command of Colonel General Ivan Chistyakov of the 1st Far Eastern Front reached the positions of the landing force. The Seishin Landing Operation had ended.  Awards  Several hundred soldiers and commanders were awarded. The commander of the 140th reconnaissance unit, Sr. Lt. Viktor Leonov received his second Hero of the Soviet Union on September 14, 1945. Red Army Nurse Mariya Tsukanova, who had been captured and tortured to death by the Japanese, was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union by decree of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, becoming the only woman that fought in the Soviet- Japanese war to receive the title.

Martínez-Almeida affiliated to the People's Party (PP) when he was 20 years old, and he earned a Licentiate degree in law at the ICADE (Comillas Pontifical University) in 1998. In 2001, he joined the State Lawyers Corps. He served as Director-General for Historic Heritage of the Community of Madrid from 2007 to 2011. In 2011, Esperanza Aguirre, the region's premier, appointed him as Secretary of the Council of Government of the Community of Madrid. He left the regional government in 2013 in order to become a member of the General Secretariat and Council of state- owned enterprise SEPIDES (currently SEPI) as Secretary of the Law Division. He left this post in 2015. Aguirre included Martínez-Almeida as a principal figure in the candidacy of PP for the 2015 Madrid municipal election and the later became municipal councillor. In 2017, as Aguirre resigned from her last offices following the detention of her political \\"dauphin\\" Ignacio González, Martínez-Almeida replaced her as Spokesperson of the PP's Municipal Group in the City Council. His interventions as leader of the opposition made him widely known. In July 2018, he was appointed member of the National Executive Committee of the PP after the election of Pablo Casado as party leader. In January 2019, he was designated candidate of the PP to be the next Mayor of Madrid. = Mayor of Madrid = He ran first in the PP list for the 2019 Madrid municipal election. Martínez-Almeida lost the council election against Manuela Carmena, Más Madrid, but due to a coalition agreement among PP Popular Party, C's Citizens and Vox, he was invested as Mayor on 15 June 2019, during the opening session of the new municipal corporation. During the campaign, the PP pledged to get rid of the star measure of the previous municipal administration: the low emission zone Madrid Central. As promised, on July 1, the City Council led by Martínez-Almeida suspended the system for three months by ceasing to fine infractions. Environmental groups such as Greenpeace cut roads in protest. However, a week later a court in Madrid restored the fines. After more than one year of legal dispute, in July 2020, the derogation of the measure was supported by a judicial sentence, but the municipal government maintained the fines. During the COVID-19 sanitary crisis he received the support of major party of the opposition. His performance gained for him a record popularity among the citizens. When the time arrived to restart the normal activity of the country the city council of Madrid was the first political administration in reaching transveral agreements for the reconstruction.

In their critique of the frequent elision of bisexuality in queer studies, Serena Anderlini-D'Onofrio and Jonathan Alexander write, \\"a queer theory that misses bisexuality's querying of normative sexualities is itself too mastered by the very normative and normalizing binaries it seeks to unsettle.\\"Ibid., p. 7.

History Bisexual theory emerged in the 1990s, inspired by and responding to the emergence of queer theory. Elisabeth Däumer's 1992 article, \\"Queer Ethics; or, the Challenge of Bisexuality to Lesbian Ethics\\" was the first major publication to theorise bisexuality in relation to queer and feminist theory.Hemmings, Bisexual Spaces, 19. In 1993, at the 11th National Bisexual Conference in the UK, a group of bisexual scholars formed Bi Academic Intervention. The same group published a volume of bisexual theory in 1997, entitled The Bisexual Imaginary: Representation, Identity and Desire. In 1995, Marjorie Garber released Vice Versa: Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life, a monograph that aimed to reveal a 'bi-erotics' observable across disparate cultural locations. In 1996, Maria Pramaggiore and Donald E. Hall edited the collection RePresenting Bisexualities: Subjects and Cultures of Fluid Desire, which turned a bisexual theoretical lens to questions of representation. Chapters of bisexual theory also appeared in Activating Theory: Lesbian, Gay Bisexual Politics (1993) and Queer Studies: A Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Anthology (1996). The Journal of Bisexuality was first published in 2000 by the Taylor & Francis Group under the Routledge imprint, and its editors-in-chief have included Fritz Klein, Jonathan Alexander, Brian Zamboni, James D. Weinrich, and M. Paz Galupo. In 2000, law scholar Kenji Yoshino published the influential article \\"The Epistemic Contract of Bisexual Erasure,\\" which argues that \\"Straights and gays have an investment in stabilizing sexual orientation categories. The shared aspect of this investment is the security that all individuals draw from rigid social orderings.\\" In 2001, Steven Angelides published A History of Bisexuality, in which he argues that bisexuality has operated historically as a structural other to sexual identity itself. In 2002, Clare Hemmings published Bisexual Spaces: A Geography of Sexuality and Gender in which she explores bisexuality's functions in geographical, political, theoretical, and cultural spaces. In 2004, Jonathan Alexander and Karen Yescavage co-edited Bisexuality and Transgenderism: InterSEXions of the Others, which considers the intersections of bisexual and transgender identities. Shiri Eisner's Bi: Notes for a Bisexual Revolution was released in 2013. This radical manifesto combines feminist, transgender, queer, and bisexual activism with theoretical work to establish a blueprint for bisexual revolution.  Epistemologies  One of the ways in which bisexual theorists have deployed bisexuality critically has been the formulation of bisexual epistemologies that ask how bisexuality generates or is given meaning.Hemmings, Bisexual Spaces, p. 31. Elisabeth Däumer suggests that bisexuality can be \\"an epistemological as well as ethical vantage point from which we can examine and deconstruct the bipolar framework of gender and sexuality.\\" Maria Pramaggiore repurposes the idea of bisexual people being ‘on the fence’ in order to theorise an ‘epistemology of the fence’: > a place of in-betweenness and indecision. Often precariously placed atop a > structure that divides and demarcates, bisexual epistemologies have the > capacity to reframe regimes and regions of desire by deframing and/or > reframing in porous, nonexclusive ways…Bisexual epistemologies—ways of > apprehending, organizing, and intervening in the world that refuse one-to- > one correspondences between sex acts and identity, between erotic objects > and sexualities, between identification and desire—acknowledge fluid desires > and their continual construction and deconstruction of the desiring > subject.Pramaggiore, Maria (1996). \\"BI-ntroduction I: Epistemologies of the > Fence.\\" Representing Bisexualities: Subjects and Cultures of Fluid Desire. > New York, NY and London: New York University Press, p. 3. Clare Hemmings outlines three forms that bisexual epistemological approaches have tended to take: \\"The first locates bisexuality as outside conventional categories of sexuality and gender; the second locates it as critically inside those same categories; and the third focuses on the importance of bisexuality in the discursive formation of \\"other\\" identities.\\"Hemmings, Bisexual Spaces, p. 31.  Critiques  In his 1996 article, Jonathan Dollimore observes a trend he terms ‘wishful theory’ in bisexual theoretical work. Dollimore critiques bisexual theory’s fabrication of eclectic theoretical narratives with little attention to how they relate to social reality, and its assumption of a subversive position that resists a consideration of how bisexual identity itself might be subverted. Dollimore contends that bisexual theory is “passing, if not closeted, as post-modern theory, safely fashioning itself as a suave doxa.” In her 1999 article, Merl Storr suggests that contemporary bisexual identity, community, organization, and politics are rooted in early postmodernity. By identifying this relation, Storr observes the postmodern themes of indeterminacy, instability, fragmentation, and flux that characterize bisexual theory and parses how these concepts might be reflected upon critically. One of the problems Clare Hemmings identifies with bisexual epistemological approaches is that bisexuality becomes metaphorized to the point that it is unrecognizable to bisexual people.Hemmings, Bisexual Spaces, p. 36.

After graduating, she worked as an application engineer in the Process and Control Division. She joined the Weizmann Institute of Science for her doctoral studies, earning a PhD under the supervision of Leeor Kronik in 2010. Marom won the Shimon Reich Memorial Prize for her PhD thesis. Her doctoral work considered the predictions of dispersion interactions and electronic structure using computational chemistry. She worked on molecules including copper phthalocyanine, azabenzenes and hexagonal boron nitride.  Research and career  Marom joined the University of Texas at Austin as a postdoctoral researcher in 2010. She moved to Tulane University as an Assistant Professor in Physics in 2013. In 2016 Marom was appointed as an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University. She is a member of the Pittsburgh Quantum Institute. Her work considers molecular crystals that are bound by Van der Waals interactions. As Van de Waal's interactions are weak, molecules can adopt a range of crystal structures. These are known as polymorphs, and can be predicted using computational simulations. The chemical and physical properties of these systems are determined by their crystal structure. Maron develops genetic algorithms that predict the structure of molecular crystals using the principles of survival of the fittest. Maron's work uses density functional theory and many body perturbation theory to study complex atomic systems. She has investigated the GW approximation for molecules. The materials investigated by Marom can be used for dye-sensitized solar cells. =Awards and honors= In 2018 Marom was awarded the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics Young Scientist Prize.

He sat as a member of the \\"Nationalrat\\" (\\"National Parliament\\") between 1949 and 1956. Despite his involvement in liberation activism and subsequent imprisonment following the country's incorporation into Hitler's Germany, Riemann found himself identified as a controversialist, or on occasion more simply as an embarrassment, by representatives of the consensual centrist Austrian political mainstream during the postwar decades. A succession of political biographies and his newspaper contributions may have contributed to this. Biography =Early years= Viktor Reimann was born and died in Vienna. Successful completion of his schooling led him to the University of Vienna where he studied History and Germanistics. Heinrich von Srbik and Hans Hirsch were two of his history tutors. In 1936 he was actively involved with the (still, in Austria, illegal) National Socialist Party. After 1938 he switched to a position of opposition, driven primarily by simple hostility to Austria having recently been integrated into an enlarged German state. In the Autumn of 1938 Reimann teamed up with the Augustinian canon regular Roman Karl Scholz to set up a \\"catholic-conservative\\" resistance group. After war broke out, in September 1939, the group was renamed, becoming the \\"Austrian Freedom Movement\\" (\\"Österreichische Freiheitsbewegung\\"). Their political objectives were to start by educating people about the true nature of National Socialism, and then to accomplish the downfall of the Nazi regime. This should be accompanied by the extraction of the Danube and Alpine provinces from the recently enlarged German state, and the re-establishment of an independent Austria, which should also incorporate Bavaria, thereby extending in a northerly direction all the way to the River Main. In the end, there were around 300-400 members, many of whom had been taught by Scholz at the monastery school an hour's walk downriver from Vienna. The group was also networked with other resistance groups, notably in former Czechoslovakia, and maintained contacts with agents of the allied powers. Such contacts were not without their own risks, however. The \\"Austrian Freedom Movement\\" was smashed thanks to betrayal by one of its members, the government spy and Burgtheater stage actor Otto Hartmann. The authorities arrested Riemann towards the end of 1940. He was held in investigatory detention for two years and then, early in 1943, sentenced by the special People's Court to ten years imprisonment. Till 1945 Viktor Reimann survived his detention at the punishment prison in Straubing. =After the war= Soviet troops reached the border from Hungary at the end of March 1945 and captured Vienna after two weeks of savage fighting by the middle of April. By the end of 1945 the Soviet occupiers had acquiesced in the creation of a provisional government under Karl Renner which immediately came into line with the tide of history by endorsing the 1943 Moscow Declarations and repudiating the 1938 annexation. War formally ended in May 1945, and with it the National Socialist chapter in Austrian (and European) history. When he was released from prison Viktor Riemann was already relatively close to home and in July 1945 he became a contributing editor on the newly launched Salzburger Nachrichten (daily newspaper). Austria had been divided into four zones of military occupation: Salzburg had ended up not in the Soviet occupation zone but in the US occupation zone, and initially the newspaper's publication was under the close control of General Eisenhower's twelfth army corps. By the end of 1945 Reimann had become deputy editor in chief, a position he retained till 1948. There are nevertheless suggestions that his (at this stage) pro-US political stance sometimes led to difficulties with senior colleagues at the paper. During his time at the Salzburger Nachrichten Viktor Reimann rediscovered an appetite for political activism more generally. With Herbert Kraus, he was a co-founder, in March 1949, of the \\"Verband der Unabhängigen\\" (\\"Federation of Independents\\" / VdU) party. When a Salzburg party branch was set up on 1 September 1949 Reimann became its chairman, as well as head of the party press department. =Politician- journalist= Viktor Reimann became a member of the \\"Nationalrat\\" (\\"National Parliament\\") in 1949. His was one of 16 seats allocated to the \\"Wahlpartei der Unabhängigen\\" (as the VdU was briefly known) which had won nearly 12% of the national vote. In the previous election, which had taken place in 1945, approximately 556,000 former members of the National Socialist party had been deprived of the right to vote. These people regained their voting rights ahead of the 1949 election. There were strong inferences drawn from the pattern of the election results, that the former National Socialists voted in disproportionately high numbers for the VdU rather than for the mainstream centre-right and centre-left ÖVP and SPÖ parties (with respectively 44% and 39% of the national vote). Attitudes towards Reimann, a relatively high- profile VdU member of parliament, were affected by those perceptions, both during his political career and subsequently. During the build-up to the (\\"anti-communist\\") Vienna Brecht boycott which took hold in the city's theatres for ten years between 1953 and 1963, Reimann joined in the criticism of the iconic playwright. In a contribution which he made in October 1951 to the bimonthly periodical \\"Die Neue Front\\" under the headline \\"Wer schmuggelte das Kommunistenpferd in das deutsche Rom?\\" (loosely, \\"Who smuggled the communist wooden horse into the German Rome?\\"), Reimann wrote that \\"giving Bertolt Brecht Austrian citizenship [in 1950] shows that our country is still undermined by communism and the Americans are continuing to fund the spiritual Bolshevisation of Austria, exploiting the eager collaboration of certain socialist intellectuals along with the uncertainties and weaknesses of the cultural power-brokers of the [governing (in coalition)] ÖVP (\\"centre-right Austrian People's Party\\"),\\"Die Neue Front\\", 13 October 1951 Throughout his time as an opposition member of parliament, Reimann's increasing public profile seems to have owed more to his continuing work as a journalist than to any contributions he made with his parliamentary work. He was editor-in-chief of the party's daily newspaper, \\"Österreichische Allgemeine Zeitung\\" from its launch on 1 December 1949 till April 1950 when publication came to an end for reasons of cost. The party's weekly newspaper, \\"Neue Front\\", fared better, printed in Salzburg alongside the Salzburger Nachrichten for seven years between 25 February 1949 and 1956. Viktor Reimann was its editor-in-chief throughout. Reimann's own contributions to \\"Neue Front\\" did much to burnish his credentials as a polemicist. \\"Neue Front\\" contained frequent articles criticising the activities of the Austrian People's Courts which had been established in 1945 (and which are not to be confused with the National Socialist era special People's Court that had concentrated on \\"political cases\\"). The post-1945 Austrian People's Courts were condemned and, some felt, defamed by \\"Neue Front\\" over their continuing attention to denunciations received concerning alleged \\"Nazi-era crimes\\". Sometimes the condemnations published had been written by Reimann himself. Those who saw \\"Neue Front\\", its editor in chief, and indeed the VdU (party) itself, as apologists for former National Socialist members and collaborators could be sharply critical, not simply within Austria, but also across the frontier in West Germany where some of the same concerns still resonated. =Journalist and author= Between 1956 and 1960 Reimann was employed as the Press Department head of the National Theatre Administration. One source describes his departure from that position a few years later as \\"noisy\\" (\\"geräuschvoll\\"), possibly because he followed it up with a sensationalist book about the widely revered Vienna State Opera. In 1970 he became a regular columnist with the mass-market Kronen Zeitung. His columns were not uncontentious. In 1972 he became editor-in-chief for the paper's Upper Austria edition, and in 1974 he moved across from Linz to Vienna in order to take charge of the arts and culture section, retaining this position till 1987. Several of Reimann's contributions, notably his 1974 series of articles in a series called \\"The Jews in Austria\\" which appeared in the Kronen Zeitung, became a focus of research involving possible antisemitic content. Conclusions were far from unanimous. There were findings along the lines that neither the intent nor the spirit of the content were as crudely or overtly antisemitic as some of the material appearing in the gutter press at the same time: that fell far short of a complete exoneration. Under the title \\"Die Dritte Kraft in Österreich\\" (\\"The Third Force in Austria\\"), Viktor Reimann published a history of the political Austrian \\"Third estate\\" since 1945. This study of the frequently over-looked classes drew praise from Wolfgang Purtscheller who found it a \\"deeply apologietic and for that reason deeply interesting book over the re-emergence of a \\"national identity\\".Wolfgang Purtscheller: Aufbruch der Völkischen.

Biography  = Family = Jaffe was born in 1933 in Riga, Latvia, to Ella Jaffe who had attended a German business school in Riga, and Jakov Jaffe, who had studied electrical engineering in Berlin. After his studies, Jakov Jaffe returned to Riga. In 1941, when the German Wehrmacht conquered Latvia, the Jaffe family – Jakov, Ella, Don, and his two siblings – had to flee to Siberia. After World War II, the Jaffes decided to return to Riga. All their relatives who couldn’t escape to the Soviet Union were murdered. In 1956, Don Jaffe married Elza Jaffe, born Peterson. They have two children: Ramon (born 1962, a cellist) and Diana (born 1969), a book author and expert in gender marketing). Since 1975, Don Jaffe has lived in Bremen. = Career = At the age of fourteen, Jaffe started to learn Cello at the Emīls Dārziņš Music School, the junior music conservatory in Riga. In 1951, he was the first string player to graduate from this music school. Jaffe finished his studies there in only four years instead of the regular ten. From 1951 to 1956 he studied Cello at the Jāzeps Vītols Latvian Academy of Music in Riga. After graduation, Jaffe worked as a soloist and chamber musician and gained international success. Jaffe also taught chamber music at the Jāzeps Vītols Latvian Academy of Music and cello the Emīls Dārziņš Music School. Pushed by growing antisemitism in the Soviet Union, Don Jaffe and his family emigrated to Israel in 1971. Jaffe immediately received a position at the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and started teaching cello at the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance (then Rubin Academy of Music). In the Yom-Kippur-War, Jaffe volunteered for the Israeli Defence Forces. In 1974, the Jaffes moved to Germany, where, as Don Jaffe put it, „their cultural roots lie“. Jaffe started to work as a solo cellist at the Berlin Symphony Orchestra. In 1975, Jaffe became a member of the Bremen Philharmonic Orchestra. From 1976 to 1992 he taught cello at the Bremen University of the Arts. In 1985, the Senate of Bremen, which is the state government of Bremen, appointed Jaffe as chamber musician. = Composer = In 1997, Jaffe started to work as a composer. His works are influenced by both his biography and Jewish history and often focus on the Holocaust and its victims. “It’s my mission to create musical monuments,“ Jaffe said. But he also stresses: “The generation of the grandchildren is not responsible for the evil deeds of their ancestors.“ Iris Heischer: Die Tonart der Shoah. In: Weser-Kurier, 3 February 2016, p. 24.

At an altitude of 1,658 metres is one of the highest summits of the Ligurian Prealps.  Geography  Summit cairn. The mountain stands on the main chain of the Alps between Tanaro and Arroscia valleys. It belongs to the province of Cuneo, in Piedmont, and is located on the border between the municipalities of Ormea and Caprauna, not faraway from Liguria.1:25.000 map of Istituto Geografico Militare (IGM), on-line on www.pcn.minambiente.it = SOIUSA classification = According to the SOIUSA (International Standardized Mountain Subdivision of the Alps) the mountain can be classified in the following way: * main part = Western Alps * major sector = South Western Alps * section = Ligurian Alps * subsection = Prealpi Liguri * supergroup = Catena Settepani-Carmo-Armetta * group = Gruppo Galero-Armetta * subgroup = Costiera Galero-Armetta * code = I/A-1.I-A.3.a  Geology  Summit cross The area of Monte della Guardia is characterized by triassic limestone. Towards monte Armetta, on the slopes facing the Tanaro valley, stands a large cave known as Grotta dei Dighè or Garb del Dighea. It was surveyed at the end of the 19th century by entomologysts that detected an interesting troglofauna with Plectogona sanfilippoi, subsp. Digheae, an arthropod endemic of Tanaro valley.  Environment  The northern side of the mountain fells with overhanging cliffs towards the valley of Tanaro river, while its gentler southern slopes are mainly covered of woods.  Access to the summit  The summit can be easily reached with a short diversion from the Alta Via dei Monti Liguri, a long-distance trail from Ventimiglia (province of Imperia) to Bolano (province of La Spezia) which flancks the mountain on its Ligurian Sea side. In wintertime the northern slopes of Monte della Guardia offer some interesting icefalls.

These deputations were equipped with \\"a phaeton (carriage) and a good strong horse\\" and were sent throughout Wales with: > \\"full powers to treat with any bank or bankers for the purchase of the > business of their establishments and also for the appointment of any clerk > or clerks they may think fit\\" the deputations were also to: > \\"proceed to such places as they may think proper with a view to open banks” =First trustees= Sir Love Parry Price Parry, Ambrose Lace and John Dean Case were appointed trustees of the bank. Applications for shares exceeded the proposed allotment and the capital structure was altered to £600,000 in £10 shares with £7 10s paid up. =Establishment of branches in Wales= Upon formation the bank commenced taking over a number of private banks. In addition the bank started to establish branches in several towns in North Wales. In order to expand into South Wales a deputation was sent there to assess the potential for new branches. In the first year of operations the bank had established 13 branches and 10 sub-branches, the furthest one being 100 miles from Liverpool. The collapse of the Northern & Central Bank of England, a Manchester bank, which has 40 branches, many in North Wales led to eight of these branches being taken over by the bank. The branches at Bishop's Castle, Newtown, Powys and Welshpool were all opened on 30 May 1836. The branches at Llanfyllin and Oswestry were opened on 8 June 1836. The branch at Ruthin was opened on 27 June 1836. The branch at Llanrwst was opened on 1 July 1836. The branches at Caernarfon and Chester were opened on 4 July 1836. The branch at Mold, Flintshire was opened on 9 August 1836 and the branch at Wrexham was opened on 19 September 1836. These eleven branches became part of Midland Bank from 1908, helping to establish their branch network in Wales. The bank took over an Aberystwyth bank called Bank y Llong on 15 August 1836 and had a branch at New Street, Aberystwyth from about 1864 to 1885, the bank then moved to a building on the south side of Great Darkgate Street and thereafter planned to move to a new building across the street, but while the new branch was under construction the takeover by Midland Bank occurred.Morgan, T.O., (1848), New Guide to Aberystwyth and its Environs, mentioned, p. 13Aberystwyth Observer, 9.1.1864Anon, (1874), Morgan's New Guide to Aberystwyth and Neighbourhood, p. 16Samuel, David, Cambrian News, 5.6.1903 The Wrexham branch was housed in the building where 43 High Street now stands and in 1861 it moved to 29 High Street. The branch at 14 High Street was opened in 1905, and became a Wetherspoons public house in 1999. It was built by Woolfall and Eccles. The facade, of yellow sandstone with polished granite columns, is in a 'baroque palazzo' style. The branch in Rhyl operated from February 1856 from old Bodfor House on the corner of Bodfor Street and Wellington Road. In 1880 the bank moved to premises in the Town Hall where they employed 10 clerks and it remained here until completion of a new building in 1900 made from locally quarried Talacre stone and Ruabon red bricks. The Llangollen branch was established in 1864. The elegant bank premises were built by Morris Roberts, who was responsible for several buildings in the town including the Town Hall and the National School. This bank was closed on 7 February 2014. In Chester the branch was known as the Grosvenor Club and North and South Wales Bank. =Establishment of branches in Merseyside= The bank became a leading bank in the Merseyside region and from the 1860s onwards it established 'town branches' and extended into new suburbs and into the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral. The town branches had many industrial, trading and shipping customers which balanced the agricultural business of the branches in North Wales, Cheshire and Shropshire. In November 1908, the bank had a total of 84 branches and 24 sub-branches. =Further development in Liverpool = The strong commercial connection between Liverpool and Wales, and the strength of Liverpool as a commercial centre meant that the bank remained permanently headquartered in Liverpool at the following locations: * from establishment to 1873: James Street; * from 1873 onwards : 62 Castle St (until the 1908 merger) * 1908 to 1980s: 62 Castle Street (as a branch of Midland Bank); * 1980s onwards: Dale Street (after merger of the two branches, the Dale Street branch previously having been a branch of another Liverpool bank). In 1901 the Liverpool base was further strengthened when the bank acquired Leyland and Bullins, a banking firm with strong shipping and cotton trade connections which had been founded in 1807. =Reputation= Under the management of George Rae (banker) the selection and training of staff and the efficiency of book-keeping systems were given high priority in comparison with other country banks. The large number of managers and clerks using the Welsh language was particularly distinctive. Graduates of the bank included (in addition to Rae) distinguished bankers such as R Meredith Jones, Liverpool manager between 1868 and 1894, and Rowland Hughes, general manager between 1897 and 1908 and the bank owed much of its reputation to the quality of its staff and its methods. =Merger= In November 1908 the bank merged with Midland Bank. The merger was initiated by Sir Edward Holden, 1st Baronet who was the chairman of Midland Bank and its managing director (chief executive officer). He was a leading figure in bank mergers of the period. Although the bank had been profitable between 1868 and 1895, with dividends of 17'/2%, the business subsequently declined. In particular, the business cycle of the cotton industry and the Panic of 1907 led to a decision to merge with Midland Bank. At the time of the merger the bank’s paid-in capital was £750,000, bank reserves were £512,000, deposits were £11 million and advance payments and bills (negotiable instrument) were £7'/2 millions. After the merger the branches and staff of the bank became part of the much larger Midland network. =Bank notes= In the 19th century, most private banks issued their own bank notes. The Bank Charter Act 1844 restricted this practice and only banks that issued notes before the implementation of the Act could do so and would lose the right on merger or takeover. The last Welsh bank notes were withdrawn from circulation in 1908 by the North and South Wales Bank, when it was taken over by the Midland Bank. After that Wales could only use notes issued by the Bank of England. Only seven banks still retain the rights to print their own notes, all of which are in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Lenders that print these notes must hold assets that are equivalent to the amount of notes they have in circulation. Plaid Cymru has said that Wales should be given back the powers to create its own bank notes, in order to give the nation equal status with Scotland and Northern Ireland. Jonathan Edwards (Welsh politician), the party’s Treasury spokesman, said that Wales had been: > “denied an opportunity to be treated as an equal nation within the UK”. He said that the issuance of Welsh banknotes “would put us on equal footing with the other nations”. The proposal would see a new private bank granted the power to issue its own notes for the first time in more than 170 years. Speaking to the Financial Times, he said: > “The issuing of Welsh bank notes, I believe, would come as a much welcomed > boost to Wales’ national character, her recognition as an equal nation and > as an economic entity” External links *J D Wetherspoon The North and South Wales Bank, Wrexham References Category:Banks of Wales Category:Defunct companies of Wales Category:Companies based in Liverpool ","title":"The North and South Wales Bank"},{"id":"61048506","text":"Junaid Sheikh (born 29 December 1999) is a Norwegian cricketer who plays for the national team.

Unraced as a juvenile he won his first two starts as a three-year-old before running second in the Radio Nikkei Sho and the winning the Grade 1 Kikuka Sho on his final appearance of the year. In the following spring he finished runner-up in the American Jockey Club Cup before recording his second Grade 1 success in the spring edition of the Tenno Sho. Background Fierement is a bay horse with a white star and white socks on his hind legs bred in Japan by Northern Farm. The horse entered the ownership of Sunday Racing and was sent into training with Takahisa Tezuka. He was from the eighth crop of foals sired by Deep Impact, who was the Japanese Horse of the Year in 2005 and 2006, winning races including the Tokyo Yushun, Tenno Sho, Arima Kinen and Japan Cup. Deep Impact's other progeny include Gentildonna, Harp Star, Kizuna, A Shin Hikari, Marialite and Saxon Warrior. Fierement's dam Lune d'Or was a top class racehorse in Europe, winning the Prix de Malleret, Prix de Pomone and Premio Lydia Tesio. In December 2010 she was sold at auction for €750,000 to Katsumi Yoshida and exported to Japan. Lune d'Or's dam Luth d'Or was a half sister to Luth Enchantee. Racing career =2018: three-year-old season= Fierement's trainer Takahisa Tezuka Fierement did not race as a two-year-old, beginning his track career on 28 January 2018 when he won an event for previously unraced three-year-olds over 1800 metres at Tokyo Racecourse. Over the same distance at Nakayama Racecourse in April he won again as he took the Yamafuji Sho, beating Nishino Baseman and nine others. On 1 July the colt was stepped up in class and started the 1.5/1 favourite for the Grade 3 Radio Nikkei Sho over 1800 metres at Fukushima Racecourse. Ridden by Shu Ishibashi he raced towards the rear of the field and turned into the straight last of the thirteen runners. He made rapid late progress overtaking all but one of his rivals to finish second, half a length behind the winner Meishi Tekkon. Takahisa Tezuka later commented that the colt was unsuited by the track. After a break of three and a half months Fierement returned in the Grade 1 Kikuka Sho over 3000 metres at Kyoto Racecourse on 21 October in which he was ridden by Christophe Lemaire and started at odds of 13.5/1 in an eighteen-runner field. Blast Onepiece started favourite, while the other contenders included Etario, Epoca d'Oro (Satsuki Sho), Generale Uno (St Lite Kinen), Meisho Tekkon, Grail (Kyoto Nisai Stakes), Time Flyer (Hopeful Stakes) and Stay Foolish (Kyoto Shimbun Hai). Generale Uno set a steady pace from Kafuji Vanguard and Cosmic Force with Fierement settled in seventh place before threading his way through the field as the runners fanned out on the final turn. Etario, ridden by Mirco Demuro, hit the front in the straight but Fierement joined him 200 metres and got the better of a closely contested finish to win by a nose. After the race Lemaire said \\"I had confidence in him as he felt good during the training. We briefly met traffic in the straight but my mount stretched really well with his bursting kick. I congratulated Mirco right after crossing the wire, thinking that we had lost, so it's unbelievable that we were able to win the race\\". In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Fierement was rated the 21st best three-year-old colt in the world and the 118th best horse of any age or sex. =2019: four-year-old season= On his four-year-old debut Fierement was made the odds-on favourite for the Grade 2 American Jockey Club Cup over 2200 metres at Nakayama on 20 January. With Lemaire in the saddle he raced in mid-division before finishing strongly, but failed by a head to catch the six-year-old Sciacchetra. Tezuka said that the horse had returned from the race with a \\"slight fever\\". On 28 April the colt contested the spring edition of the Tenno Sho over 3200 metres at Kyoto: it was the 159th running of the race (which is run twice a year) and the last of the Heisei era. He was made the 1.8/1 favourite ahead of his old rival Etario, while the other eleven runners included You Can Smile (Diamond Stakes), Clincher (Kyoto Kinen), Meisho Tekkon, Glory Vase (Nikkei Shinshun Hai) and Perform A Promise (Copa Republica Argentina). The outsider Vosges set the pace from Lord Vent d'Or and Meisho Tekkon with settling in seventh place until Lemaire made a forward move and sent the favourite into the lead on the final turn. He was soon joined by Glory Vase on the outside and the pair drew away from the field to engage in a sustained struggle over the last 400 metres before Fierement prevailed by a neck. There was a gap of six lengths back to Perform A Promise who took third place. Lemaire commented \\"It was a tough race to win but Fierement really showed his strength. He was able to relax early on which is important in a long-distance race like this... He's improving with every race\\". In the Sapporo Kinen over 2000 metres at Sapporo Racecourse on 18 August Fierement started the 1.3/1 favourite but despite making strong progress in the straight he was unable to catch the leaders and finished third behind Blast Onepiece and Sungrazer. The colt was then sent to Europe to contest the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 6 October. Racing on very soft ground he tracked the leaders before dropping out of contention in the last 600 metres and came home last of the twelve runners after being eased down by Lemaire in the closing stages. On his final appearance of the season Fierement contested the Arima Kinen over 2500 metres at Nakayama on 22 December in which he was ridden by Kenichi Ikezoe and finished fourth behind Lys Gracieux, Saturnalia and World Premiere. In January 2020, at the JRA Awards for 2019, Fierement finished fourth to Win Bright, Indy Champ and Suave Richard in the poll to determine Best Older Male Horse.

Having served in Bomber Command in the Second World War, he was shot down and interned at Stalag Luft III—this was The Great Escape camp and he acted as a watcher but was not involved in the escape itself. He remained in the RAF after the war, commanded RAF Stafford, served in Palestine, Aden and Malta, before retiring in 1978. He later campaigned for a memorial to Bomber Command: one was finally erected in 2012 in London. Early life and education Clarke was born on 25 November 1923 in the Old Street area of Tottenham, London, England. He was the eldest of three children of Thomas Clarke, who had fought in the Machine Gun Corps in the First World War, and Elizabeth. He was educated at Down Lane Central School in Tottenham. He left school at the age of 17. RAF career =Second World War= Bomb- aimer on board an Avro Lancaster In 1941, Clarke joined the Royal Air Force. Serving in the other ranks, he rose to leading aircraftman. On 1 March 1943, he was commissioned into the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve as a pilot officer on probation (emergency commission). He was posted to No. 619 Squadron, where he served as a bomb aimer on the squadron's Lancasters. He completed 18 missions before being shot down on his 19th. On 25 February 1944, while on a bombing mission to Germany, Clarke was shot down over the Black Forest. He and three others parachuted from the plane; the three other crew members died in the crash. He was captured by the Germans, and eventually taken to Stalag Luft III: he arrived at the prisoner of war camp weeks before The Great Escape of 24/25 March 1944. Clarke acted as a watcher to those digging the tunnels (warning them of any nearing guards) and as a forger (creating papers for the escapees). He did not take part in the escape itself, and remained in the camp until a forced march in January 1945 (the \\"Long March\\") took him and the remaining prisoners to a new camp near Lübeck. He was promoted to a war substantive flight lieutenant on 1 March 1945. He was liberated by British forces in April 1945. In later life, he helped build a replica of Hut 104 (the start of The Great Escape tunnel) at Stalag Luft III, and would return each anniversary to Poland to retrace the steps he took on the \\"Long March\\". =Post-war service= On 1 January 1947, Clarke transferred to the equipment branch as a flying officer with seniority on that rank from 1 March 1945. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 25 February 1948. He was granted a permanent commission on 1 April 1952, thereby allowing him to serve in the RAF until retirement. As part of the half-yearly promotions, he was promoted to squadron leader on 1 January 1953, to wing commander on 1 July 1961, and to group captain on 1 January 1967. In addition to his Second World War service, he undertook a number of overseas postings. He served in Palestine during the 1947–1949 Palestine war, in Aden during the Aden Emergency and the British withdrawal in 1967, and in Malta. From 1967 to 1970, he was officer commanding RAF Stafford. He also had desk jobs at the Ministry of Aircraft Production, the Air Ministry, and at the Ministry of Defence. Clarke retired from the Royal Air Force in November 1978, with the rank of air commodore. Later life Clarke with fellow Stalag Luft III prisoner Andy Wiseman in 2012 After retiring from the RAF, Clarke moved into business, including working as a director of the department store Debenhams. He maintained his links with the RAF through serving as President and Chair of the Royal Air Forces Ex-POW Association and as Chair of the Bomber Command Association. He was a leading figure in the campaign for a memorial to Bomber Command: one was eventually erected in 2012 in London's Green Park. In the 2007 New Year Honours, he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) \\"For services to the Royal Air Forces Ex-Prisoners of War Association\\". Personal life Clarke met his wife, Eileen (née Fosh), at a war-time dance. They married in November 1946, following his return from the war. Together they had a daughter, Naida: she is a former merchant banker who married Sir Gordon Duff. Clarke died on 7 May 2019, aged 95.

Previously, she has worked on Alankrita Shrivastava's critically acclaimed Lipstick Under My Burkha as the dialogue writer and she wrote the dialogues and co-wrote the screenplay for Qarib Qarib Singlle, directed by Tanuja Chandra, starring Irrfan Khan and Parvathy. She also wrote additional dialogues for Wazir that starred Amitabh Bachchan and Farhan Akhtar. She is also a public speaker and LGBTQ+ activist, who has spoken openly about being a transgender woman in several talks and in the media – most famously in an episode of the Aamir Khan-led talk show, Satyamev Jayate. Currently, she is heading a writers’ room for a leading streaming platform.  Early life and education  Gazal Dhaliwal grew up in the city of Patiala in Punjab, and was born to Sikh parents Bhajan Pratap Singh Dhaliwal and Sukarni Dhaliwal. In several interviews and talks, she mentions how for as long as she can remember, she always felt like she was a girl. However, growing up in a culture that celebrated a highly macho form of masculinity made it increasingly difficult for Gazal, who was bullied with homophobic and transphobic slurs. At the age of 14, she secretly went to a counsellor, but was found out by her father, after which she told him about her identity. Gazal mentions that although her father acknowledged it, he thought that it was \\"a phase\\". When she was 17, cyber cafes connected Gazal to the internet, and she found out about gender dysphoria and sex reassignment surgery. However, it was a distant dream, and prevailing stigma and the lack of awareness pushed Gazal to run away from home and board a train to Delhi. However, she was terrified, and finally returned her parents' calls and promised to return home. Gazal went to the Budha Dal Public School in Patiala, and then pursued a Chemical Engineering degree from Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur. After graduation, she joined Infosys in Mysore as a software engineer. However, Gazal's passion lay in the world of Bollywood. In 2005, she quit her job and moved to Mumbai, studying filmmaking at Xavier Institute of Communications for a year, and assisted Govind Nihalani on an animated film script. While at Xavier's, she and a few friends created a 20-minute documentary on transgender people, which interviewed doctors, psychiatrists and other transgender people in India. After it was released, she travelled to Patiala to show it to her parents. It was after this that her parents agreed to a sex reassignment surgery. She then spent the next three years undergoing sex reassignment and finally had the surgery in 2007, after which she returned to Patiala and worked at an advertising agency.  Career  In 2009, Gazal Dhaliwal returned to Mumbai and wrote her first ever movie script, reportedly shutting herself up in a room and writing for 25 days straight. Although that first script has not yet been turned into a movie, since then, Gazal has lent her voice to the scriptwriting process of several big budget films. In 2014, she also appeared in the third season of Satyamev Jayate, a television show dedicated to discussing social and political issues hosted by Indian actor Aamir Khan, in an episode titled \\"Accepting Alternate Sexualities\\". She also made her acting debut in 2015 in the short film Agli Baar, about slum dwellers' fight for their right to land. Her screenwriting debut came with an opportunity as the Additional Dialogue Writer of Wazir, starring Amitabh Bachchhan, in 2016. Since then, she has been Dialogue Writer of Lipstick Under My Burkha, Qarib Qarib Single, Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga, and the short film A Monsoon Date starring Konkona Sen Sharma.  Activism  In 2016, Gazal attended the International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) on transgender rights in the US as a part of an 8-member team. It was the first Indian team of its kind to be part of a three-week exchange program that was organised by the US Department of State. Gazal Dhaliwal has spoken out against the controversial Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2018, and voiced her support for the scrapping of the Bill as it does not grant transgender people the right to self-determination of their gender identity, and makes no mention of the educational and professional reservation quotas for transgender people. She has also spoken about being okay with the constant tag of \\"trans woman\\" that is added to her many professional achievements as a scriptwriter. \\"In the professional world, I want to be known for my work rather than my status as a transwoman. My gender cannot be my only identity when I am writing a story because a story has no gender. Having said that I have a substantial reason to be okay with the tag 'transwoman' scriptwriter because I know the importance of the visibility of a transgender. Our community does not have enough representation which is very important,\\" she said in an interview with Business Standard.

Set in the 1920s, the plot entails an American naturalist visiting a Norwegian fishing village to find that the town's population has vanished. The player must explore the town, discover its fate and survive the night. The game emphasizes the more sinister aspects of Norwegian folklore.  Gameplay  Draugen follows Edward Harden and Lissie, searching for Edward's missing sister Betty in Graavik. It is split into six chapters, where each chapter represents one day. During that time, Edward and Lissie go further into the mysteries by finding letters, exploring the areas, and putting all the clues together. In its noir-styled story narrative, Draugen deals with certain themes, including psychology, isolation, and trauma. There is an interactive component, where besides having dialogue choices, the players are able to engage with the world though objects (drawing in a personal journal, playing on a piano, ringing bells, and others).  Development  The game was developed for Windows, Mac and Linux. It was initially slated for a November 2014 release, the same month that Dreamfall Chapters was set to debut. Red Thread received a grant of NOK 850,000 (US$144,000) from the Norwegian Film Institute to produce the game. This made up the lion's share of the game's NOK 1,192,546 (US$200,000).

Neopagan music is music created for or influenced by modern Paganism. It has appeared in many styles and genres, including folk music, classical music, singer-songwriter, post-punk, heavy metal and ambient music.  Interwar period  The Latvian neopagan movement Dievturība developed a musical life in the 1930s, focused on the instruments kokles and trīdeksnis, choir music and Latvian folk music. In a 1937 article, the movement's chief ideologue Ernests Brastiņš wrote about the religion's sermons, which included music that \\"should create solemn and harmonious feelings\\". This was initially handled by the organist, composer and conductor Valdemārs Ozoliņš (1896–1973). The other main contributors were Jānis Norvilis (1906–1994) and Artūrs Salaks (1891–1984). Norvilis created choral arrangements of folk songs for calendar celebrations. Salaks, a composer and folklorist, became the movement's musical leader in 1936. His own music was characterized by diatonic scale and drones, and combined archaic and new elements in what he dubbed \\"the Latvian style\\". In 1938, Salaks released a collection of choral songs titled Latviešu dievestīgās dziesmas (\\"Latvian songs of adoration\\"). Also in the 1930s, the Norwegian composer Geirr Tveitt (1908–1981) became affiliated with the Germanic neopaganism of the National Socialist journal Ragnarok and its publisher Hans S. Jacobsen. Jacobsen drew heavily from Jakob Wilhelm Hauer's theories and promoted the adoration of the Norse gods. This influenced Tveitt's musical compositions, notably the ballet Baldurs draumar (1938). Tveitt maintains a high status as a composer in Norway, but his affiliation with this milieu is controversial.  Counterculture and second-wave feminism  A self-identified pagan scene for popular music emerged in the United States in the 1970s. A pioneer was Gwydion Pendderwen (1946–1982), who established an emphasis on folk music and singer- songwriter material. Another early contributor was Charlie Murphy (1953–2016), whose song \\"Burning Times\\" became popular in the early 1980s. Their style owed much to the British folk revival of the 1960s, in particular British folk rock acts like Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span. Another important element was the chant, exemplified with Zsuzsanna Budapest's \\"We all come from the Goddess / And to Her we shall return / Like a drop of rain / Flowing to the ocean\\". Chants and songs were made integral to the religious rituals of the milieu. World music gradually became a central component, partially due to concerns of inclusion. This expressed itself through drumming circles where Middle Eastern malfuf rhythms became the standard, sometimes alternated with African-based clave rhythms. Pagan recordings and performances began to feature doumbeks, tars and djembes. The mythological material has predominantly been drawn from Celtic mythology. Records from this pagan scene were sold in New Age stores and information about new music was spread through magazines like Circle Network News and Green Egg. As a legacy from the counterculture of the 1960s, neopaganism in the United States developed a close relationship with the New Age movement. A prominent example of this is the Starwood Festival, held every summer since 1981 in southwestern New York. The festival hosts musical performances, rituals and an eclectic program of workshops. Kay Gardner (1940–2002) was an adherent of Dianic Wicca and one of the founders of women's music, which emerged as the musical expression of second-wave feminism. Her works include the oratorio Ouroboros: Seasons of Life—Women's Passages. It portrays a woman's life cycle from birth to death using the symbols of the Triple Goddess and neopagan holidays. According to the musicologist Ruth A. Solie, feminist music overall had its origin in the Goddess movement, which inspired women to express their inner lives through music.  Neopagan movements in post-war Europe  Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson in 1991 In Iceland, Ásatrúarfélagið's first allsherjargoði Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson (1924–1993) was known as both a writer and singer of rímur, a traditional form of alliterative poetry or songs. He can be seen performing in this style in the documentary film Rokk í Reykjavík. In 1982 he released an album, Eddukvæði, where he sings from the Poetic Edda. Another work with ties to Ásatrúarfélagið is Odin's Raven Magic, a 2002 choral and orchestral setting of the Icelandic poem Hrafnagaldr Óðins. It was made by the allsherjargoði Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson (born 1958) in collaboration with Sigur Rós and Steindór Andersen. The folk music group Kūlgrinda was founded in 1989 by Inija (born 1951) and Jonas Trinkūnas (1939–2014), the leaders of the Lithuanian neopagan movement Romuva. The group functions as the movement's musical expression and is an integral part of its rituals. It is specialised on sutartinės, traditional polyphonic song-chants. Romuva's website describes Kūlgrinda as a \\"ritual folklore group\\".  Rock music  = Neofolk and the \\"Euro-pagan scene\\" = The genre of neofolk emerged from industrial music in the 1980s and is musically related to the post-war folk revival and gothic rock. The political scientist Robert A. Saunders calls it a \\"closely-related cousin\\" of folk metal, and writes that it partially overlaps with genres such as neoclassical, neo-medieval, folk-pop and pagan metal. The historian of ideas Stéphane François has written that neofolk, also known as apocalyptic folk and dark folk, largely overlaps with what he calls the \\"Euro-pagan scene\\", which is \\"characterized more by a mindset, an overall message, than by a musical genre\\". Beyond musical commonalities, neofolk is distinguished by an elitist view of culture, opposition to rationalism and modern homogenisation, an interest in Europe, identity and ethnicity, and dark visions. Frequent subjects in the song lyrics include ancient history, the Middle Ages, World War II and the occult. For some bands this has led to the embracement of pagan revivalism, which has been explicitly present in the scene from the very beginning, through people such as Robert N. Taylor of the band Changes. Other examples include the band Sol Invictus, Ian Read of the band Fire + Ice; who also is the director of the Rune-Gild's journal Rûna; the Dutch neopagan Freya Aswynn who has collaborated with several British groups, and Michael Jenkins Moynihan of the band Blood Axis, who also edits the journal Tyr. François associates the themes of the \\"Euro-pagan scene\\" with the political right, especially the conservative revolutionary movement, but also sets it apart from right-wing culture through its willingness to engage in avant-garde artistic expressions. Some people within the scene, such as Moynihan, are influenced by the Nouvelle Droite and Alain de Benoist. Although François writes that the early and more influential bands are well-informed about their themes, he also describes a strong presence of \\"diluted esotericism\\". The conventions and cultural references established by the early groups do not necessarily correspond to a particular worldview among the newer bands that copy them. = Pagan rock = Candia and Tony McKormack of Inkubus Sukkubus at the Wave-Gotik-Treffen in 2014 Pagan rock music as a particular genre emerged from British post-punk, especially gothic rock. According to the writer, journalist and DJ Jason Pitzl-Waters, many younger pagans in the 1980s and 1990s adopted gothic rock as their preferred alternative to the tastes of the baby boom generation, which at the time dominated the neopagan institutions. By the mid 2000s, the genre had fully integrated into the mainstream of those institutions. Some mythic themes occurred in goth lyrics from the early 1980s, as part of the genre's propensity for the romantic, medieval and primordial. This became more prominent in the \\"second wave\\" of the genre, spanning from the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s. One of the most successful bands of this wave, Fields of the Nephilim, make ample references to the occult and paganism in their lyrics. Another band from this wave is Inkubus Sukkubus, formed in 1989 and explicitly referring to itself as a pagan band above everything else. Inkubus Sukkubus had a mainstream breakthrough in the United Kingdom with the release of its debut album in 1993, and would go on to perform at both mainstream venues and neopagan events. The success of Inkubus Sukkubus inspired a number of other British bands to adopt a \\"Pagan-Goth identity\\", something that quickly spread to other countries. The Australian-British band Dead Can Dance, formed in 1981, has had a significant impact on neopagan popular music, although neither of its own members has expressed any allegiance to paganism. Dead Can Dance began as a goth band but gradually moved away from the genre and has added elements such as world music and references to mythology. The annual music festival Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Leipzig, which focuses on genres such as gothic rock and dark wave, has a \\"Pagan Village\\" for pagan festival goers. = Heavy metal = Heavy metal music inherited an interest in Satanism and the occult from its progenitors in 1960s rock music. Beginning in Scandinavia around 1990, many metal bands came to replace the Satanic theme with an interest in paganism. Few of these musicians regarded themselves as religious, but the black metal scene in particular developed an affinity for paganism and folk customs. An example is a 1995 essay by the Austrian musician Gerhard \\"Kadmon\\" Petak, which quotes from Otto Höfler to draw parallels between black metal and traditions surrounding the Wild Hunt motif. The essay first became influential in the Alpine black metal scene, and received wider distribution when an English translation was included in the 1998 book Lords of Chaos. Among metal bands that explicitly profess to religious paganism are Arkona from Russia, Falkenbach from Germany and Skálmöld from Iceland. Individual musicians include Gaahl, involved in metal bands like Gorgoroth, Trelldom and God Seed, and Pierre Wilhelmsson, former bass guitar player and lyrics writer for Månegarm.  Eclecticism: ethno-gothic, pagan folk and ambient  A wider popular music scene has formed in Europe around festivals like the Wave-Gotik- Treffen in Germany and Castlefest in the Netherlands. The formula of bands like Dead Can Dance has spawned what Pitz-Waters has labeled \\"ethno-Gothic\\", represented by bands like Ataraxia from Italy, Rhea's Obsession from Canada and the Australian musician Louisa John-Krol. Other openly pagan or occult- oriented bands with a clear debt to Dead Can Dance include Seventh Harmonic, Atrium Animae, Daemonia Nymphe and Íon. Faun at the Feuertal Festival in Wuppertal in 2016 The German band Faun formed in 1999 and had their first mainstream success in Germany in 2013. They emerged from the neo-medieval music scene but developed an eclectic style, which involves folk music and electronic music. They dubbed this pagan folk, a term that has been picked up by other bands such as Omnia from the Netherlands. Typical for the pagan folk genre are premodern instruments, medievalist costumes and imagery, as well as modern elements in order to create an idealised vision of an archaic past that is present in the contemporary world. The German Andrea Haugen's projects Aghast, Hagalaz' Runedance and Nebelhexë express a Germanic paganism focused on the cycles of nature and feminine mysteries. Haugen's musical influences include the English neofolk of Sol Invictus and Fire + Ice, the dark wave of Dead Can Dance, and Scandinavian folk music acts like Hedningarna and Mari Boine. The musicians of the Norwegian group Wardruna have a background in the metal genre, and have subsequently influenced some metal bands. Wardruna have created ambient music based on the runes and their meaning. They aim to use \\"the oldest of Nordic instruments\\"; this has included harp, frame drum, mouth harp and goat horn, and the natural sounds of trees, rocks and water.  Art music  Some composers of art music draw on Pagan themes. Die erste Walpurgisnacht, set to music by Felix Mendelssohn, tells of Druid rituals in the Harz mountains. Merry Mount by Howard Hanson celebrates early colonial American Neo-Paganism.Iannis Xenakis composed Persephassa in honor of the goddess Persephone. Most of the works of Bronius Kutavičius are inspired by ancient Lithuanian polytheistic belief and music.

They are traditionally involved as performers of classical dance and music in Hindu temples and courts of the patrons. The term \\"Isai Vellalar\\" is a recent community identity, and people of minstrel occupation from various castes such as Ambattar, Agamudayar, Melakkarar, Nanayakkarar, Nattuvanar and Sengunthar come under this term. The Isai Vellalar and Vellalar both are different communitues. They doesnot have any historical connection with Vellalar. The females of this community were occupied as Devadasi (ritual temple dancers), while the male were occupied as musicians associated with the nadaswaram (windpipe instrument) and the melam (drum).  Etymology  The term Isai Vellalar derives from the Tamil words Isai meaning \\"music\\" and Vellalar a generic term roughly meaning \\"cultivator\\", thus translates as \\"cultivators of music\\". This term was introduced after the legal abolition of the Devadasi system as a result of the reform and anti-nautch movement in 1947. The term \\"devadasi\\" is a Sanskritized form of the Tamil term tevaratiyāl (tevaratiyar in plural form) derived from thevar meaning \\"god\\" and atiyal meaning \\"female devotee\\".  History  The Isai Vellalar communities were originally nomads. Bardic traditions are referred in early Sangam literature and well into the early Pallava and Pandya periods. These were primarily ritualistic and defensive in nature. The artistic side of music and dance came to be strengthened during the Chola and Vijayanagara periods, where these elements were observed in the courts and temples. Early Chola inscriptions mentions Tevaratiyar as recipients of food offering and ritual performers of the temples, and was a term carrying honorific and high connotations. Inscriptional evidences indicates the Tevaratiyar women to have been independent professionals who enjoyed property (made large land donations to temples) and a respectable position in the society. The 11th-century inscription of Rajaraja I states that the Tevaratiyar were invited to serve the Brihadisvara Temple and were given land near the temple. Under the patronage of the Nayaks of Tanjavur and Thanjavur Maratha kings, Telugu musicians from Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra migrated to the Thanjavur region. The Melakkarars of Thanjavur are therefore divided in two distinct linguistic groups – the Tamil and Telugu Melakkarar. With the entry of Colonial India, great loss of temple patronage resulted the Tevaratiyar to perceive other ways of income which degraded their social status. The Devadasi system was legally abolished in 1947 after the campaigns of the social reformers Moovalur Ramamirtham and Muthulakshmi Reddi. The entry of Tamil Brahmins in music and dance was seen as a threat to the traditional performers of these art forms. This led communities traditionally associated with music and dance to start forming a politicized non-Brahmin caste association which they coined as \\"Isai Vellalar Sangam\\" and thereby created a political unified identity.

The initial attempt to put the gun on a naval mount was a failure. The Kalinin factory started work in 1934 on a new design that was accepted in late 1936.

The same mount was combined with the Army gun as the 90-K system beginning in 1942. Development of a twin-gun electrically powered mount also began in 1936, but it was not accepted until October 1939 as the 39-K. Only 15 mounts were produced before production ceased.

Her first book, Back in the Frame, was published by Little, Brown Book Group in May 2019 and she is represented by Bell Lomax Moreton.  Early life  Walker grew up in Canning Town, east London with the first bike she owned being a 'metallic green trike'. Later, she started riding a BMX her older brother restored and taught her to ride. However, she says that the 'disgusting comments' she got riding her bike to school made her cycle less and less, eventually stopping in her late teens.  Career  Walker started her blog Velo-City Girl in 2010 after purchasing 'the bike of my dreams', a Pashley Princess using the Cycle to Work scheme her employer, the University of East London, offered. In 2012 she joined cycle clothing firm Vulpine as the operation's manager and started presenting on ITV4's The Cycle Show, with Walker leading on features including the annual vintage cycling festival, l'Eroica festival as well as appearing on the BBC's Newsnight, on a feature on cycling culture. She was featured in the online edition of La Fuga, the cycling industry periodical, in one of their 'Industry Portrait' features. In 2015 she was highlighted as one of Bike Biz's '100 Women of the Year. In 2018 she started work with the London Bike Kitchen on a regular Women of Colour cycling meet-up after realising that one of the barriers for her to starting cycling again was not seeing 'anyone I identified with'. She now speaks regularly of the need for more diversity in cycling at all levels and of the barriers that keep prevent Women of Colour from accessing cycling.  Cycling and health  In 2016 Walker suffered a stroke and Back in the Frame describes Walker's life with depression. She described its description of her experiences in an interview with The Guardian, saying:, \\"I’m not trying to be the poster child for what cycling can do for you, but in my book I try to use the experiences that I’ve had on and off a bike, and turn it all into a positive.” In May 2019 an extract from Back in the Frame was published in The Daily Telegraph.

Honours and awards In 2018, Clarivate Analytics named him as one of the World's Most Influential Scientific Minds and Highly Cited Researchers in Engineering. This highly anticipated highly cited researchers annual list identifies scientists and social scientists who produced multiple papers ranking in the top 1% by citations for their field and year of publication, demonstrating significant research influence among their peers. In 2019 Linga received an Outstanding Asian Researcher and Engineer award for accomplished outstanding achievements in chemical engineering in Asia by the Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan (SCEJ). In 2017, he was awarded the Donald W. Davidson Award at the 9th International Conference on Gas Hydrates (ICGH9) held in Denver USA for his outstanding contributions to gas hydrate research. He was awarded the prestigious Young Researcher Award (YRA) in NUS in 2017. He is an elected fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry in United Kingdom. An independent research and bibliometrics analysis by Microsoft Academic on the topic of clathrate hydrate ranks Linga among the top 10 authors in the world and National University of Singapore among the top 10 institutions in the world. A recent publication in Energy Reports based on bibliometrics analysis of carbon capture technologies has identified Linga as one of the influential authors in carbon capture technologies. For his excellence in teaching, he received the Annual Teaching Excellence Award (ATEA) in 2017 from National University of Singapore. ATEA is awarded to faculty members who have displayed a high level of commitment to their teaching for the year under review. Research contributions Linga's research interests are in the areas of clathrate hydrate or gas hydrate, energy storage, carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) and energy recovery. His targeted applications are seawater desalination, gas storage, data center cooling and carbon capture & storage. A part of his research is also focused on energy recovery from methane hydrate, which is considered as a huge energy resource for natural gas. His research group has been working on process innovation and process development to scale- up clathrate hydrate as a technology enabler for clean energy and sustainable applications. These applications include seawater desalination, solidified natural gas (SNG) technology for gas storage, development of a new cooling technology for data centre with semiclathrates as a medium. A novel method to capture carbon dioxide is to employ the hydrate-based gas separation (HBGS) process from pre-combustion and post combustion streams where water is used as a solvent to capture it.https://sequestration.mit.edu/pdf/Advanced_Post_Combustion_CO2_Capture.pdf Linga and his group have worked extensively on this topic with more than 30 journal publications on this process. Linga and his group’s finding that inter-particle pore space is a key property to enhance the kinetics of hydrate formation enabled them to test, validate and report very cheap materials (sand, polyurethane foam) as a porous medium for the HBGS process with enhanced kinetics. On the fundamental level, their group evaluated the performance of a number of promoters for HBGS process including tetrahydrofuran, cyclopentane, and many semi-clathrate formers. Recently, Linga and his group demonstrated engineering innovation for Solidified Natural Gas (SNG) technology via clathrate hydrate for natural gas storage. About 95% of Singapore’s power needs are met by natural gas-powered power plants and all of the natural gas is imported. Hence, Linga and his group embarked on developing the SNG technology as proof-of-concept and demonstrated its viability for a large scale stable stationary storage. Their group were the first to report a synergism between methane/tetrahydrofuran that rapidly enhances the kinetics of hydrate formation. His research group was the first in the world to demonstrate the long-term storage of SNG pellets for several months. Linga has published more than 20 journal papers, secured 1 patent and co-founded a one spin-off company (NewGen Gas Pte Ltd) on the SNG technology. Selected publications Linga has published more than 110 peer-reviewed journal articles with an h index of 51 and his articles are cited more than 8000 times. A selected list of the invited review papers published by his group are listed below.

He is visited by Gonzalo, his former lover (FIRST MAN), who recriminates him for the lack of risk in his artistic design, and insists that the true theatre is that “under the sand”. Gonzalo pressures Enrique to remove his “mask” and dare to live the truth of their love, and perform the theatre he truly likes. Afraid and nervous, the Director calls ELENA, his wife, who reveals herself as a Greek statue: an ideal, but made of stone. Elena confronts Gonzalo harshly. The Director is split between his true love (Gonzalo) and social norms (Elena). A folding screen appears: the characters cross it and emerge dressed with fabulous women clothes or theatrical costumes. Second Scene  The ruin A scene set in Roman ruins that bring back the memory of the past relationship between the Director and Gonzalo, who are presented as the Characters in Vine Leaves and in Bells, who argue, love each other, and fight. The scene also goes into the dark and violent side of sex. The EMPEROR rapes and kills a boy. Third Scene  The Theatre under the Sand The Director stages a new version of Romeo and Juliet, this time in its form as “theatre under the sand”. The scene unfolds in Juliet's grave, underground. The fascinating character of JULIET appears the embodiment of the tensions between the bourgeois lifestyle (false, conventional and external) and another way of living that acknowledges the complete truth of the individual, including the deep, dark parts, represented by the BLACK HORSE. The climax of the Theatre under the Sand, and maybe the whole play, is the dance of the empty costumes (Pierrot, Ballerina and Pyjamas), while Juliet goes back to her grave. Fourth Scene  The revolution In the new version of Romeo and Juliet, the Director has cast a boy as Juliet. When discovered, this sparks a revolution that seems to envelop the whole city. The choir is divided in Students (supporters of the revolution who celebrate the freedom of love) and the Ladies (who represent the bourgeois and conventional point of view, and who want to leave the theatre at all costs). A Christ painted in red appears on the bed of a hospital. When he exhales his last breath, we see that he is Gonzalo, the First Man. Gonzalo, the inspiration behind the Theatre under the Sand, ends up being a victim of the audience's fury. Fifth Scene  The Magician Back in his office, the Director faces a MAGICIAN, an expert in trickery and swapping, whose falseness is rejected by the Director who says: “But that’s a lie, that’s theatre!”. The Director has assumed his love for Gonzalo, and has discovered that “To sleep is to sow seed”. Gonzalo's mother appears to demand the body of her dead son. The play closes with a melancholic rain of empty gloves. Reception The opera El Público was premiered at the Teatro Real in Madrid on February 24, 2015, and had 8 performances, with the last performance taking place on February 13. King Don Felipe and Queen Doña Letizia attended this last representation, being this the first time they visited Teatro Real as Royals. The event was echoed by the national press, as it appears in the newspaper El Mundo (Spain) Los Reyes Felipe y Letizia acuden por primera vez a la ópera en el Real, as well as by the international press, as reflected for example by the magazine Paris Match . The premiere of El Público was reviewed by numerous international media, as well as by specialized critics. The eight performances hosted, according to data from the Theater, a total of 11,697 spectators with an average of 88% occupation, which can be described as a success for a production of a contemporary opera.

Moira is introduced as the eccentric ex-soap-star wife of Johnny Rose and mother of their adult children, David and Alexis. She is often portrayed as the family member most resistant to life in Schitt's Creek – viewing their loss of fortune as temporary. In later seasons, Moira's story also becomes more community-oriented as she forms closer relationships with the townspeople. Moira was portrayed by actress Catherine O'Hara for the series' entire 80-episode run. She was cast by her long-time collaborator and Schitt's Creek co-creator, Eugene Levy. Her work as Moira garnered several awards, including five consecutive Canadian Screen Awards; one ACTRA Award; one Canadian Comedy Award; two Television Critics Association nominations for Individual Achievement in Comedy; two Primetime Emmy nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, winning one in 2020; and one Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series.  Role in Schitt's Creek  Moira Rose is a formerly wealthy daytime soap star, most known for her role as Vivian Blake on Sunrise Bay. She and her husband, Johnny Rose (Eugene Levy), the former CEO of the second-largest video rental company in North America, share two adult children, David (Dan Levy) and Alexis (Annie Murphy). David is a former New York City gallerist and current co-owner of Rose Apothecary, while Alexis is a former socialite and current owner of her own public relations business. Moira has one known younger sister named Deedee (Jennifer Irwin). She grew up in a small town not all that unlike Schitt's Creek, where she took pride in her self-sufficiency and ability to master the basics of everyday living.\\"Honeymoon\\". Schitt's Creek. Season 1. Episode 10. April 15, 2015. Pop TV.\\"Family Dinner\\". Schitt's Creek. Season 2. Episode 2. March 16, 2016. Pop TV. Her big acting break came when she was cast as Sally Bowles in a production of Cabaret after the director spotted her working at a local gas station deli. Moira would go on to act in a number of theater productions before being cast in Sunrise Bay, where she stayed for six and a half seasons. During her time as an actress, Moira met her future husband at the grand opening of one of his video rental stores. The two married sometime later and have remained married for many years. Moira is the matriarch of the Rose family. A previously inattentive mother, she often struggles to connect with and care for her now adult children. Her attempts at mothering are often awkward (such as the time she forgot her daughter's middle name) or otherwise poorly executed. Her son, David, is in many ways her favoured child; as the series progresses, she also begins to establish a relationship with her daughter, Alexis. Moira's closest confidant is her husband, Johnny, whose \\"straight man\\" demeanor balances and steadies her bombastic tendencies. This pairing continuously highlights Moira's ability to be loving and kind even when she has difficulty expressing those feelings to others. Outside of her family, Moira's closest connections are with high school teacher Jocelyn Schitt (Jennifer Robertson) and members of the Jazzagals a cappella group. Jocelyn and her husband, mayor Roland Schitt (Chris Elliott), are some of the first people to show the Roses hospitality when they move to Schitt's Creek. Moira is reluctant to return this kindness, but by the end of the first season displays glimmers of gratitude when she gifts Jocelyn one of her designer fur coats. This relationship grows when Moira joins the Jazzagals, a singing group founded by Jocelyn. While a part of this group, Moira also forms bonds with fellow members Ronnie Lee (Karen Robinson) and Twyla Sands (Sarah Levy). Her relationship with Ronnie also extends to their work on the town council – work they share with Roland, who sometimes frustrates Moira.  Character  = Creation and casting = The character of Moira Rose was developed by Schitt's Creek's father-son co-creators Eugene and Dan Levy. She (along with the rest of the Rose family) was inspired by the wealthy reality TV stars of such programs as Keeping Up with the Kardashians and The Real Housewives franchise. The Levys always envisioned the character to be a former soap star and socialite, but say that O'Hara brought an \\"extreme affection\\" to Moira which made her \\"so much funnier than [we] imagined\\". O'Hara was the creators' first choice for the role. She was offered the role by Eugene Levy, with whom she had previously co-starred in SCTV and several Christopher Guest films. She was initially reluctant, citing \\"laziness\\" and an aversion to long-term projects. Levy subsequently contacted another actress for the role, but was ultimately able to convince O'Hara to participate in the pilot presentation by assuring her that she was not obligated to commit to the full series. When the show was picked up to series by the CBC, O'Hara agreed to continue in the role. = Design = Moira wears a Daphne Guinness-inspired wardrobe rendered in almost exclusively black and white tones. The structured, designer garments set her apart from the local residents and serve as a kind of \\"armor\\" against the influences of Schitt's Creek to which Moira remains resistant. Away from the townspeople, she is no different – often wearing a business suit-inspired vest over her silk pajamas. Moira also wears a wide assortment of designer wigs, which range in style from a platinum blonde bob to short, red, and curly. Each wig is selected, in part, to reflect Moira's mood or state of mind in the scene. All of these design choices come from O'Hara, who suggested the character's overall look in her first meetings with the Levys. Dan Levy also says Moira's wardrobe is intentionally designed to remind the audience of the Rose family's former wealthy standing. = Personality = Moira is, as described by Matt and Haley Brennan of Paste Magazine, \\"spoiled, eccentric, [and] exceedingly dramatic\\". Nearly everything she does, whether it is attending a town council meeting or babysitting a child, is completed with a kind of theatric flair. Moira often pairs these grand displays with biting sarcasm, such as when she tells the motel clerk that all she needs in her room is a \\"bathtub and a long extension cord\\".\\"Our Cup Runneth Over\\". Schitt's Creek. Episode 1. Season 1. February 11, 2015. Pop TV. But on rare occasions, Moira lets the ego and bluster fade – displaying both a tenderness toward her children and a distinct despair over the loss of her former life. To facilitate her over-the-top persona, Moira utilizes an indistinguishable accent and frequently peppers her vocabulary with arcane words like \\"frippet\\" and \\"pettifogging\\". As The Atlantic's Amanda Walsh notes, she also \\"adopts an affectation that transforms monosyllabic and disyllabic words into something simultaneously lofty and ridiculous\\". O'Hara stated that her character's unique – what some have called Canadian dainty – accent is a kind of \\"souvenir\\" from Moira's world travels. Her archaic vocabulary also expands throughout the series, with O'Hara often adding her own select phrases to the scripts. = Character development = According to O'Hara, Moira thinks about leaving Schitt's Creek \\"every day\\". Unlike her husband and children, who largely settle into Schitt's Creek throughout the series, Moira remains resistant to living in the town long-term. Because of that, her only long-term commitment to the town has been a seat on the town council. Her time in Schitt's Creek nevertheless allows her to develop closer relationships with her family, which evolve from largely disconnected to occasionally sweet and loving as time passes.  Reception  = Critical reception = O'Hara has received widespread praise for her work as Moira throughout the series. In an early review, Gillian Telling of People Magazine suggested that her portrayal on the series \\"might be her finest character work ever\\". Paste Magazines Erica Lies called her a \\"standout\\", and said \\"the entire show is worth watching just to see her meltdown as she gives acting lessons to middle school teens or drunkenly shoot[s] a commercial for a terrible winery\\". As the series gained a larger following after its release on Netflix in 2017, O'Hara received even more acclaim from critics. Michael Ausiello of TVLine noted that her work as Moira was \\"even more uproarious – and heartfelt – than the deafening buzz lets on\\". Vanity Fairs Richard Lawson also heaped on praise, calling O'Hara's turn \\"a thrill of a performance\\". The Daily Beasts Matt Wilstein suggested that O'Hara was \\"at the top of her game\\" and \\"deserves to win all the awards her character Moira Rose never could\\". Logos Lester Fabian Brathwaite went further, and called her performance as Moira \\"the embodiment of perfection\\". = Accolades = O'Hara won her first Canadian Screen Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Continuing Leading Comedic Role for her work as Moira in 2016. She won this award again in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, tying (with her own Schitt's Creek castmate Emily Hampshire) the record for the most Canadian Screen Awards won by a comedic actress. In 2016, she was also awarded an ACTRA Award for Best Performance – Female, and in 2019, the Canadian Comedy Awards named her the Comedic Artist of the Year. This same year, she also received a Television Critics Association Award nomination for Individual Achievement in Comedy and a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. As part of the Schitt's Creek ensemble cast, O'Hara has won two Canadian Screen Awards for Best Comedy in 2016 and 2019, also receiving a nomination in 2017. O'Hara won an additional ACTRA Award with the cast for Member's Choice Series Ensemble in 2019, an award for which the cast was also nominated in 2017 and 2018. The cast also received its first Dorian Award, GLAAD Award, Critics’ Choice, Primetime Emmy Award, and Television Critics Association Award nominations in 2019, from which they won two Dorian Awards for TV Comedy of the Year and Unsung TV Show of the Year. She won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 2020.

He was among the first physicians to experiment with chemotherapy for leukaemia. After secondary education at Arnold School, Wilkinson began in 1913 his study of chemistry at the University of Manchester. In 1916 he joined the Royal Naval Air Service. When WWI ended, Wilkinson resumed his study of chemistry at the University of Manchester, graduating in 1920 BSc with first class honours, in 1921 MSc, and in 1923 PhD. At the University of Manchester he became a demonstrator in crystallography, but then studied medicine, qualifying MB ChB Manch in 1928. Experience of the effects of mustard gas in WWI suggested to him that nitrogen mustards might be effective against bone marrow cancers. With Martin C. G. Israëls, Wilkinson experimented with these agents as therapy for patients with leukaemia. In his youth he was extremely active in The Boy Scouts Association. As a scout he was presented with a badge by Baden-Powell in 1919. In 1924 the increasing demands of his medical career caused him to resign from most of his Scouting commitments, but he continued his involvement with Scouting until his death. He had a large and successful private practice mainly at his rooms at Lorne Street, Manchester, but he sometimes made domicilliary visits in the counties near Manchester. In 1926 George R. Minot and William P. Murphy published their famous paper on feeding raw liver to patients with pernicious anaemia. Wilkinson demonstrated a relation between diet and haematinic activity in tissue by studying stomachs and livers from many species of animals at Manchester's Belle Vue Zoological Gardens and later at Chester Zoo. From 1928 to 1947 at the Manchester Royal Infirmary he was director of the department of clinical investigations and research. In 1931 he graduated with medical research MD from the medical school of the University of Manchester. During the 1930s he once was called upon to delouse the entire ballet company of the Sadler Wells Ballet. From 1934 to 1948 he was a lecturer in systematic medicine at the University of Manchester. Wilkinson was from 1938 to 1946 the director of the Manchester and Salford Blood Transfusion Service and from 1939 to 1946 a regional officer for the North West Blood Transfusion Service. During the 1940s he, with Frank Fletcher, did pioneering research on chemotherapy for leukæmia, Hodgkin's disease, and polycythæmia vera. From 1947 to 1962 Wilkinson was at the University of Manchester a reader in medicine and haematology and at the Manchester Royal Infirmary head of the department of haematology. He was a co-founder, with Leslie John Witts, of the British Society for Haematology. In 1962 Wilkinson retired from the National Health Service, but he continued to treat patients when he was in his nineties. In 1977 in his Samuel Gee lecture, Wilkinson described his extensive collection of antique medicine jars. The collection is now displayed at the Thackray Medical Museum in Leeds. He was a motorist on both roads and race-courses, a keeper of tropical fish, and a collector of antique porcelain (as well as antique medical jars). In 1964 in Bucklow, Cheshire, he married Marion Crossfield (1920–2003), a Major in the Women's Royal Army Corps, but they separated in the 1990s.

According to the regulations of the Education Administration Department or the school, on the basis of the principle of free admission to the nearest school, the school (mainly the key primary and secondary schools) recruits students within the designated geographical area. Students in this area can enjoy compulsory education and enter the nearest school without exams. People call this area \\"the school district\\". Accordingly, the property and real estate in this area are called “school district houses”.  Background  Since the 1990s, the outstanding educational benefits of key schools have attracted a lot of parents to pay a large sum of money or use social resources to send their children to these schools. Some key schools run their own subject training institutions for primary school students or cooperate with social institutions. They also select outstanding students to enter their junior high school from the subject training institutions. In order to increase the probability of being admitted to key secondary schools, parents often let their children participate in training courses which are designated or closely related to key schools. To equalize the opportunities for students to enter the school, narrow and balance the gap between key schools and weak schools, and promote the balanced development of compulsory education, the policy of “nearby enrollment” was released. The promulgation of “nearby enrollment” has led to the emergence of “school district houses”. If a school-age child's household registration is in a good school district, he can enter a good school; however, if he is in a school district with poor quality education, he can only be educated in this backward school district. Since the promulgation of“nearby enrollment”, many families have gone to the community with key schools or famous schools to purchase real estate or replace the original property with this community, so as to choose the ideal school for their children. They do it at all costs, just to obtain a household registration that meets the policy of“nearby enrollment”.  History  In 1962, the Ministry of Education issued the “Notice on the Successful Implementation of a number of Full-time Primary and Secondary Schools”. It requires a number of key primary and secondary schools to be selected from all over the country. The quantity and scale of these schools should be matched with the enrollment of higher-level schools, so as to deliver talents for higher education. Besides, they also should concentrate on running a number of “top-notch”schools. In 1983, the Ministry of Education issued the “Opinions on Further Improving the Quality of General Secondary Education”. It mentions the method of slashing and nearby enrolling in junior high school enrollment, in order to liberate primary school students from excessive burdens and pressures. In 1992, the State Education Commission promulgated the “Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Compulsory Education Law”. Article 26 of its fifth chapter stipulates: “The implementation of compulsory education schools shall be planned and rationalized by the municipal or county-level people's government in the district. The setting of primary schools should be beneficial for school-age children and teenagers to enter the school nearby.” “Nearby enrollment “aims to regulate the government’s implementation of compulsory education. As for children, “nearby enrollment” is a kind of right granted to them by law. In 1993, primary schools basically achieved “nearby enrollment”. However, the implementation of it had not been fully achieved in the entrance to junior high schools, because the entrance examination for junior high schools still remains. Under this background, in 1993, the State Council promulgated the “Outline of China's Education Reform and Development”. It proposes to establish the nearby enrollment for primary school graduates, the entrance examination for junior high school graduates, the high school graduation exam and the entrance examination and examination system for the college entrance examination. In 1995, the State Education Commission promulgated the “Implementation Opinions on Governing the Unreasonable Charges in Primary and Secondary Schools”. It clearly states that in the nine-year compulsory education stage, primary schools and junior high schools must adhere to the principle of “nearby enrollment”, and it is not allowed to enroll in “the students through the choice of school”. In addition, it is strictly forbidden to link the donated funds to the enrollment of students. The opinion also points out that the fundamental measures to solve the problem of school selection and unreasonable charging are to speed up the adjustment of school layout and attach importance to the construction of weak schools. These measures can narrow the gap between schools and thus implement the policy of “nearby enrollment”in a fundamental sense. since then, in the stipulations of the various policy documents issued by the Ministry of Education, the principle of “free admission to the nearest school” in the primary school and junior high school has been repeatedly mentioned and emphasized. On June 29, 2006, at the 22nd meeting of the Standing Committee of the 10th National People's Congress, the revised “Compulsory Education Law of the People's Republic of China” further restricts the “nearby”. Its Article 12 stipulates that local people's governments at all levels shall guarantee that school-age children and adolescents are enrolled in schools near the place where they are registered. As a result, school education not only associates with the housing location, but also closely links with the housing property rights and household registration. On January 28, 2014, the General Office of the Ministry of Education issued the “Notice on Further Improving the Free Admission to the Nearest School of Compulsory Education in Key Cities”. It emphasizes that four municipalities directly under the central government, five municipalities with independent planning status, and 10 deputy provincial capital cities should formulate a plan to further standardize “free admission to the nearest school”of compulsory education in the next year.  Social Consequences  General rise in house prices In the real estate advertising, many real estate developers strongly promote the surrounding schools or even directly bring in the famous schools, as a reason for price increases. School district houses have become the leader in the rise and fall of house prices. When the real estate market is in a downturn, school district houses are the important force to hold up house prices and prevent public opinion from being bearish. The housing price of school district houses has become another indicator and criterion for the reasonableness of housing prices, and has become an important support point for the real estate market.

The compiler is written in Zig and C++, using LLVM 10 as a back-end, supporting many of its native targets.The compiler is free and open source software under the MIT License. The Zig compiler exposes the ability to compile C and C++, similar to Clang by using the command \\"zig cc\\" and \\"zig c++\\", respectively. The Nim programming language supports the use of zig cc as a C compiler.

Early life and education  Owen Thomas was born in Merseyside to parents of Welsh and German heritage. She attended Merchant Taylors' Girls School In Liverpool and St Hugh's College, Oxford, where her teachers included the prominent organist James Dalton and the composer Robert Saxton. She received a scholarship to travel to Hamburg, where she briefly studied with composer György Ligeti, whose organ music she later wrote an article about. The period in Hamburg led to Owen Thomas being commissioned by to write the solo organ piece Rosaces (1984), which was subsequently widely performed and published by Novello.  Return to England and career  Returning to England, Owen Thomas worked as a composer, organist and teacher during the 1980s. In 1988, she was commissioned to write a new work to celebrate the opening of the Tate Gallery, Liverpool, New and Better Days, a setting of words from the Book of Isaiah and by Boris Pasternak, for choir, organ and trumpet. The success of this work encouraged her to focus her energies on composition, while she briefly reentered education, enrolling for a course in 1990 in Music technology at the University of York, where she also explored her interests in algorithmic composition, fractals and astronomy, a fascination developed during a visit to India. It was during this time that she wrote a music theatre piece, The Condom Tester's Lament, for speaker and electronics. She went on to take advanced composition studies with Anthony Gilbert at the Royal Northern College of Music. In 1991, the BBC Proms presented the UK premiere of Rosaces. Owen Thomas was the youngest composer whose music was featured in that year's festival, and the work went on to be played in over a dozen countries. She lived and worked in York during the 1990s, where she continued to compose and teach at The Minster School, York, and at the Department of Music at the University of Huddersfield, while ill health increasingly prevented her from performing. Her literary inspirations included the works of Verlaine, Gerard Manley-Hopkins, Wendy Cope and Dylan Thomas, all of whose words she set to music. She intended to complete an operatic setting of Racine's play Phèdre, but was unable to begin work on this before her death. Her music was commissioned and performed by ensembles including the Goldberg Ensemble, the Allegri String Quartet, the Bingham String Quartet, Gemini, Lontano, and Boccherini String Trio, the soprano Mary Wiegold and organist Kevin Bowyer. Her largest work was Under the Skin (1999), a large ensemble work commissioned by the BBC for the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, including the words of Dylan Thomas' poem \\"Do not go gentle into that good night\\" and utilising the theme of the plainchant hymn Dies irae.  Style  In her obituary for Owen Thomas, fellow composer Nicola LeFanu described the former's musical style as follows: > The hallmark of her style is linear counterpoint; the music is carefully > constructed to allow for self-similarity in its proportions, both in the > large and in the detail. In speaking of her work, Thomas acknowledged the > influence of the 17th-and 18th-century music which she played so much in her > days as an organist. Her contrapuntal textures are transformed, though, by > the \\"shimmer and glitter\\" which she loved.  Death  Owen Thomas died of cancer at the age of 41. At the time, she was working on a concertante work for organ, left unfinished. In the obituary published by The Times, it was said of her death that \\"contemporary British music has lost one of its most promising creative talents... her reputation will rest on a mere handful of fastidiously crafted works mainly for voice and chamber ensemble\\".  Significant works  * Rosaces (1984) for solo organ. * Watermark (1986) for winds and piano, commissioned by the Mill House Festival, Aynho. * New and Better Days (1988) for SATB choir, trumpet and organ, commissioned for the opening of Tate Liverpool. * Cantus (1992) for 11 solo strings, commissioned by Bang on a Can and subsequently broadcast on BBC Radio 3. * Trio Del Cantus (1994) for string trio, commissioned by the Park Lane Group. * Fiori musicali (1997) commissioned and recorded by the Bingham String Quartet. * Under the Skin (1999) commissioned by the BBC for the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival.

In late June 1981, a team of M-19 operatives that included Jaime Guillot Lara , arrived in Hamburg, Germany, under orders from M-19 commander Jaime Bateman to purchase a cargo ship capable of carrying 40 tons of cargo across the Atlantic all the way to Colombia. The team purchased an old cargo ship named the 'Roland Crussy', and sailed to Libya. In Libya, the ship was loaded with 1,000 Belgian FN FAL combat rifles, and one million rounds of 7.62x51mm ammunition. The ship then sailed to the Canary Islands, where it was painted and re-christened 'El Karina'. Fully fueled, the Karina sails to Panama, where half the load is transferred to a stolen cargo ship named 'El Zar'. The weapons on the Zar are sailed to Colombia's La Guajira Department, and hidden near a clandestine landing strip outside the beach town of Dibulla. Meanwhile, the Karina, still holding half the weapons, crosses the Panama Canal and tries to disembark its load along Colombia's Pacific coastal region of Chocó, but is intercepted by the Colombian Navy ship ARC Sebastián de Belalcázar, and sunk. Three M-19 crew-members survived: Fernando Erazo, Héctor Gonzales, and Jairo Rubio. In order to move the weapons that were stashed near Dibulla, another M-19 commando hijacks a Curtiss C-46 cargo plane belonging to the charter company Aeropesca. They land the plane in the clandestine airfield where the weapons are stored, load them onto the plane with the help of local marijuana smugglers, and fly south towards the M-19's jungle stronghold in the Caquetá Department.https://www.aviacol.net/historia-aviacion/secuestro- curtiss-c46-hk388-aeropesca.html Unable to find a suitable landing strip, the M-19 force the cargo plane's pilot to land in the Orteguaza River.

A Republican, he serves in the Oregon House of Representatives where he represents District 53. This district is located in Central Oregon and includes a portion of Deschutes County. Zika was first elected in 2018. Early life and career Zika was born in Ohio and attended the University of Cincinnati. He worked as a securities trader and, immediately prior to his election to the Oregon House of Representatives, as a realtor in Bend. Political career Zika previously served on the City of Redmond Planning Commission before being elected to the Oregon House of Representatives. In December 2017, Zika filed his candidacy to become the next representative for District 53 replacing incumbent Gene Whisnant, who decided to retire after more than fifteen years in office. In the Republican primary election, Zika faced an incredibly close election result against primary opponent and conservative activist Ben Schimmoller. The initial count showed Zika leading Schimmoller by 11 votes, but the final recount narrowed Zika's victory to a margin of only 2 votes. In the general election Zika defeated his Democratic opponent, retired Daimler Trucks executive Eileen Kiely, securing 56% of the vote to become the new Representative for the district. With his election he became the first state legislator from Redmond in 40 years, the last being Sam Johnson, who served in the Legislature from 1965 to 1978. =80th Oregon Legislative Assembly= In the 80th Oregon Legislative Assembly, Zika serves on the House Committee On Energy and Environment, the House Committee On Human Services and Housing, and the House Committee On Veterans and Emergency Preparedness. Zika was the chief sponsor on House Bill 2222, a bill to improve wildfire protection in Oregon. HB 2222 would require the Oregon Department of Forestry to report to the state legislature regarding its implementation of the Oregon Forestland-Urban Interface Act, which was signed into law in 1997. This act was intended to provide property owners resources from the Oregon Department of Forestry and incentives to help eliminate brush and ladder fuels around homes, to better protect Oregon residents from catastrophic wildfire. HB 2222 received broad bipartisan support in both chambers of the state legislature and was signed into law by Governor Kate Brown on May 23, 2019. Zika opposed House Bill 3063, which would have ended all non-medical exemptions to school vaccination requirements. He described the experience of his son developing a rash after receiving a partial vaccination for chickenpox as part of his rationale for opposing the bill. HB 3063 passed the House and went to the Oregon Senate for deliberation, but the bill was ultimately scrapped as part of a concession deal from House Democrats. House Republicans had previously walked out in strike over House Bill 3427, which would generate an annual $1 billion business tax to fund school grants and other education programs. The concession deal prompted House Republicans to return and allow the quorum necessary to vote on the latter bill. Zika opposed Senate Bill 608, which would limit annual rent increases and strengthen tenants’ rights. He expressed concerns about the unintended consequences for the bill and that it could reduce the quantity and quality of housing available. Zika also opposed Senate Bill 320, which would allow Oregon to observe daylight saving time on a year-round basis.

Life  Pfister studied history and geography at the University of Bern from 1966 to 1970, where he graduated in 1974. This was followed by study visits to the University of Rochester and the University of East Anglia in Norwich. He habilitated in 1982. From 1990 to 1996, Pfister was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) in his research on climate history. From 1997 until his retirement in 2009, he was Full Professor of Economic, Social and Environmental History at the Historical Institute of the University of Bern. For the first time, his professorship combined the three pillars of the sustainability discourse. Since 2009, he has been working as a freelance researcher at the Oeschger Centre for Climate Research at the University of Bern. His successor at the University of Bern in 2010 was Christian Rohr, who is now Professor of Environmental and Climate History. Pfister acted as founding president of the European Society for Environmental History (ESEH). In addition to climate history, he has made a name for himself in agricultural history, population history, regional history, the history of natural disasters and environmental history.  Work  = Climate history = Pfister is regarded as one of the pioneers in the field of historical climatology.Thomas Stocker in: Christian Pfister, a historian passing across borders. Interview with Hans von Storch and Heinz Wanner introduced by Thomas Stocker, December 2018, in: academia.edu (pdf) His research focuses on the social dimension of climate change and nature induced disasters, and the reconstruction of past weather and climate change from historical documents for the period before the use of instrumental measurements. He is particularly known for the further development of the Pfister climate indices, named after him, into a powerful instrument for the reconstruction of approximate values for temperatures and precipitation from historical documents. In this way, Pfister has succeeded in \\"connecting climate history with quantitative climate science. (...) The results obtained from Climate History, especially those concerning extreme events, contribute to improving risk assessment by broadening the basis of statistics.\\"Christian Pfister, a historian passing across borders. Interview with Hans von Storch and Heinz Wanner introduced by Thomas Stocker, December 2018, in: academia.edu (pdf) The project \\"European Palaeoclimate and Man since the Last Glaciation\\" of the \\"European Science Foundation\\" (1989) became important for historical climate research in the longer term. In this context, Pfister led a research group that gathered documentary data from all over Europe to reconstruct monthly weather charts for the period 1675–1715. In this context, he adapted the Climhist software package, developed for the documentation of the \\"Climate History of Switzerland\\" (1984), to create the European database Euro-Climhist. Since the 1990s, Pfister has gradually expanded and methodically refined the database. Today (2019), Euro-Climhist is the largest climate history database with over 200,000 records.Franz Mauelshagen: Klimageschichte der Neuzeit. wbg, Darmstadt 2010, , p. 1, 27 f., 55–58. = Agricultural history = Agricultural- historical topics occupy a large space in Pfister's writings, since they are closely linked to climate history and population history. He distinguishes four agricultural utilisation zones in Old Swiss Confederacy: the cereal- growing area in the Swiss Plateau, the pastoral area in mountainous areas, a zone of mixed field-grass cultivation in hilly areas, and areas of intensive viticulture. The main focus of his analysis and models is on cereal production. In this context Pfister has worked out the importance of the nitrogen cycle for productivity development.Christian Pfister: The early loss of ecological stability in an agrarian region. Nitrogen, energy and the take- off of «solar» agriculture in the Canton of Bern, in: Peter Brimblecombe and Christian Pfister (eds): The silent countdown. Essays in European Environmental History. Springer, Berlin 1990, p. 37–55. 3 = Population history = Since Erich Keyser’s Population History of Germany (Leipzig, 1938) no synthesis had been written for German speaking areas in the Early Modern Period. At the beginning of the 1990s, Christian Pfister took on the task of collecting and compiling a hardly comprehensible number of small-scale, at best regional and heterogeneous studies worked out over half a century, and to press them into the framework of a small volume of the Encyclopaedia of German History. = Regional history = Both Christian Pfister’s dissertation (1974) and his habilitation thesis (1984) were committed to the histoire totale of the Annales School in addition to climate history. His focus on the Canton of Bern opened up a field of regional history that continued to occupy him in the years that followed. Through the fine division of its landscape, the Canton of Bern offers a patchwork of zones which followed different paths in their development. Pfister’s monograph \\"Im Strom der Modernisierung\\" (Bern, 1995) meets the methodological postulate of a histoire totale with extraordinary precision and spatial-temporal differentiation; and can be regarded as a material history in the best sense of the word, in which energy sources and food, agricultural production methods and their modernization appear just as much as the people who give birth, eat, work, argue, invent, try, age and die, and are not only processed into statistical series of numbers.Daniel Krämer and Stephanie Summermatter, Introduction to: Sustainable History. Festschrift for Christian Pfister. Chronos, Zürich 2009, p. 17. Concurrent to Climhist, Christian Pfister set up the BERNHIST regional history database from 1984. In 2009, the database contained around 1.5 million individual data from the fields of population, economy, environment and politics for the period from 1700 to the present. In 2019, a modernized version of BERNHIST was launched. = Environmental history = Based on its energy base (biomass, coal, oil, and gas), Pfister divides economic and environmental history into three fundamental social periods – agricultural society, industrial society and consumer society. His thesis is that the current urgency of the climate problem and the glut of plastic waste is due to the flooding of markets with cheap oil from the late 1950s onwards. The corresponding anthology (Pfister 1995b) experienced a second edition in 1996. An enlarged synthesis in English was published in 2010.Christian Pfister: The “1950s Syndrome” and the transition from a slow-going to a rapid loss of global sustainability, in: Frank Uekötter (ed.), Turning Points in Environmental History, University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, p. 90–117. = History of nature induced disasters = From 1882 to 1976, Switzerland was largely spared natural disasters. Pfister demonstrates that this \\"disaster gap\\" () contributed to natural risks being underestimated until the late 1980s. It was not until this time that natural disasters were discovered as an attractive topic in historical research. In his \\"Weather Hindcast\\" (1999), Pfister links the climate variations of the last five hundred years in Switzerland with the description of severe natural disasters. He postulates that natural disasters can be regarded as pacemakers of modernization and, at least in Switzerland, were fundamental for the development of a nationwide solidarity between the poor mountain regions and the wealthy regions in the Swiss Plateau. With these theses he succeeded in giving a new depth to the primarily cultural-historical discussion about the interpretation and perception of disasters. He has written several articles on natural disasters and, together with Christof Mauch, published an anthology on this topic in 2009.Christof Mauch and Christian Pfister: Natural disasters, cultural responses: case studies toward a global environmental history.

Her work has been shown with ltd Los Angeles (including NADA Miami and Art Toronto), and in the Royal Ontario Museum, McGill University, The Art Gallery of Ontario, YYZ Artist Outlet, The Drake Devonshire Gallery, Art Lab Gallery at Western University, Georgia Scherman Projects, amongst others. Mohamoud graduated from Western University with a Bachelor's in fine art in 2014 and later from Ontario College of Art and Design University, in June 2016, with a master's degree in fine arts. Her art focuses on interrogating issues around black masculinity culturally in sports (in the NBA and NFL) and politically in North American society at large. She creates sculptures, photography, and drawings to bring awareness to and to expose these specific issues in today's society. Mohamoud's outstanding notable works include exhibits One of the Boys, Heavy, Heavy (Hoop Dreams), Glorious Bones, Blood and Tears Instead of Milk and Honey, A Seat Above the Table, Untitled (No Fields) Why See the World When You’ve Got the Beach?, Chain Gang, I Am Series, and Unholy Matrimony.  Selected Works  = One of the Boys (2017-2018) = From 2017-2018, Mohamoud collaborated with Qendrim Hoti to create and photograph sculptures that are designed to be worn by black, male-presenting models. In One of the Boys, men and women wear custom- made ball gown jerseys, thus pointing to gender fluidity and race through their use of fashion. Mohamoud uses Vince Carter’s Raptors jerseys for the top half of the gown and the bottom half is a beautiful puffy dress. The jersey itself is not of the usual sports mesh, but is made of velvet and contains corset lacings on both sides an allusion both to basketball through the use of shoelaces and to high fashion through the use of corseted tops. Some of the models can be seen wearing jewelry such as earrings, rings, necklaces, colorful hair ties, braids, and tattoos. Amanda Parris points out that some of the models in this series face away from the camera or conversely they stare directly at it, something Mohamoud terms the “power stance.\\" The fashion and body language is this piece work in tandem to create a harmonious balance between femininity and masculinity. This balance of feminine and masculine objects and poise convey the overarching theme of gender fluidity depicted on and through black, male bodies. Mohamoud's design of the jersey and the ballgown is meant to convey gender fluidity in a way in which it is difficult for viewers to categorize the subject of the photographs in a binary fashion. The Raptors jersey itself is meant to symbolize masculinity, as athleticism is usually thought to be masculine, and the ballgowns are meant to symbolize femininity. The title of the series, One of the Boys, is derived from the artist's personal experiences. Mohamoud recalls her mother requiring that she wear a dress when she wanted play basketball with the neighborhood boys. Mohamoud stated that she wore a dress and put a Raptors jersey on top to which her mother reprimanded, “you are not one of the boys.” Mohamoud reflects on what this statement meant to her during her childhood, when a tension existed between her wanting to play basketball like Vince Carter and her societal obligation to align herself with feminine ideals. One of the Boys is meant to dissipate this tension Mohamoud felt throughout her childhood and the tension that many others, specifically young, black men may feel. One of the Boys explore and exposes how black male bodies and notions of masculinity have been shaped and viewed by society. Mohamoud focuses on black men in sports and uses basketball specifically to explore societal problems around the construction of black masculinity. In the book Black Sexual Politics, Patricia Hills Collins explains how and why black masculinity is treated and viewed the way it is in sports, specifically in basketball. Collins shares the story about a professional black basketball player named Latrell Sprewell, playing for the Golden State Warriors at the time, who choked his coach P. J. Carlesimo. Collins says Sprewell was viewed “as the worst of basketball” and his actions gave a bad reputation to all black basketball players. Collins notes that black basketball players are thought of as irrational “bad boys” that are too sensitive and can't control their aggressive nature when provoked. Collins states Sprewell's mistake contributed to a societal belief that black basketball players are a bad example of masculinity and establishes the idea that all black men are violent, greedy, childish, rule breakers, and “too black”. Since black male masculinity was deemed out of control, sports have been used to control and polish black masculinity to be more like white masculinity. Collins argues that it is clear that society believes people must “submit to White male authority in order to learn how to be a man,\\" and this is what Esmaa Mohamoud is fighting against with and through her art. Mohamoud argues that, \\"[i]f we don't take up space, a white body will.\\" Through this series, Mohamoud attempts to combat pervasive associations of black male bodies with hypermasculinity, violence, and ruggedness, by engaging the models in hyper-feminine clothes and poses. The artists recalls that many people in her hometown of London, Canada were fearful of blackness as Black people, particularly Black men, are perceived in violent light. Author and activist, bell hooks, has acknowledged in her book, We Real Cool: Black Men and Masculinity, the long-standing belief that black men are the embodiment of violence and aggression, stating “read any article or book on black masculinity and it will convey the message that Black men are violent.” This image of violence can be dangerous for black men as they navigate their way through the world. To counter this, Mohamoud attempts to offer black men the freedom of gender fluidity. By clothing black, male models in velvet gowns, Mohamoud shields them with the notion that black men can too possess the ability to be fragile and soft. Through her art, Mohamoud brings awareness to a current and problematic view of black masculinity in order to shift it and reclaim it is as her own through a subversion of gender norms, \\"power stances,\\" and the use of bell hooks' the \\"oppositional gaze.\\"  References  Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century sculptors ","title":"Esmaa Mohamoud"},{"id":"61050119","text":"Classic 263, formerly Radio 1 and later Spot FM / SFM is a Zimbabwean talk radio station that is owned by the country's national broadcaster and broadcasts mainly in English.

He is an engineer and political activist who went on to become the youngest elected Mayor of Medellín in October 2019. Early life and education Daniel Quintero Calle was born in Campo Valdés, a suburb on the northeastern slopes of the Aburra Valley. Soon after he was born, the family moved to Tricentenario, a working-class suburb farther north of the city center, where Quintero and his two brothers were raised by their single mother, Stella Calle; a self-employed woman. Quintero commenced his university studies at the early age of 14 when he enrolled in the National University of Colombia, Medellín. However, that same year his mother (39) suffered a fatal heart attack that exacerbated the family's financial situation. Quintero was forced to interrupt his university studies soon after his mother's death due to financial hardship. In order to survive, Quintero and his 2 brothers tried all sorts of informal self-employed jobs such as street vending, delivering parcels and selling home-cooked desserts. Over the next 4 years Quintero attempted to resume his university studies several times but was still unable to afford his ongoing tuition fees. Eventually an employee in the university enrollments office took pity on him and generously offered to pay his tuition fees. Quintero finally resumed his studies in 1999 and in 2004 earned his undergraduate degree in Electronic Engineering at the University of Antioquia, Medellín. Between 2004 and 2008, Quintero also completed further specialization studies in applied finance at University of The Andes, Bogotá. In 2009, Quintero travelled to the United States in order to complete a short course in Public Financial Management at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. In 2011, Quintero travelled to the Unites States again to pursue postgraduate studies at Boston University, Massachusetts. There he earned a master's degree in Business Administration(MBA) a year later. Personal life Quintero is married to Diana Marcela Osorio with whom he has one daughter, Maia. Quintero grew up with his two brothers Miguel Andrés and Juan David. Although he did not grow up with his father, Orlando Quintero, a car mechanic, Quintero maintains a close relationship with him. A third half- brother, Diego, didn't grow up with Daniel and his brother. Professional career In January 2004, Quintero founded a software development company (Intrasoft S.A.) and served as its CEO until 2012. In March 2015, Quintero was appointed as the CEO of INNpulsa Colombia, a government agency focused on promoting productivity, entrepreneurship and innovation in Colombia. He served in that position until July 2016, when he was called by the then President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, to serve as the Deputy Minister of Digital Economy in the Ministry of Information, Technologies and Communications (TIC). Political career From childhood Quintero has been interested in the causes of social inequality and the ongoing lack of development opportunities that affect millions of Colombians. In 2007, Quintero commenced his political career when he ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the Medellín Council under the support of the Conservative Party. In 2013, Quintero founded the Tomate Party, a movement that reached 80,000 followers and was fueled by 90,000 businesses collectively. 'Tomate' being a play on the word 'tómate', the Spanish expression for 'take it', which aimed at inviting ordinary citizens to 'take' responsibility and engage in the political process. Their campaign tactics were, of course, 'tomatadas' (protesting by throwing tomatoes), 'cacerolazos' (protesting by beating on frying pans), the 'cicladas' and several other pacific representations. The message was environmental, political awareness, education and cultural expressions. The party did not achieve political representation because of it was unable to raise $230 million Pesos to reach the required threshold applicable to local elections. In the 2014 national elections Quintero ran for a seat in Congress (House of Representatives) representing Bogotá D.C. under the support of the Liberal Party. He launched his campaign by jumping off a bridge while hanging of a rock climbing rope. While jumping, the candidate proclaimed: 'I feel Liberal'; again, a play on a form of the Spanish word 'libre', meaning 'free'. In the 2018 presidential elections, Quintero campaigned for Humberto de la Calle, the candidate for the Liberal Party and key participant in the Peace Process that had recently resulted in a historical peace agreement between the Government and FARC (Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces). The peace process required a national referendum which Quintero strongly supported and actively campaigned for. Upon Humberto de la Calle's defeat in the first round of the presidential elections, Quintero went on to support and campaign for the controversial leader of the Colombia Humana Party, Gustavo Petro. Quintero was elected Mayor of Medellin in October 2019 while running under the banner of the political movement Independientes (Independents). He won office with a record number of votes and at the age of 39 will become the youngest ever mayor of Medellín, Death threats During his phase as a candidate to the position of Mayor of Medellin in 2019, he received threats from some of the local criminal organizations.

The eastern part of the building is of 10th century date, whereas the western part is 12th century. The church is of architectural interest and is being considered for World Heritage Site status along with nine other Mozarabic sites. It is currently on a \\"tentative list\\" (part of the nominating process). History During the reign of King Recceswinth (died 672), Wamba had a royal residence and the existence of a Visigothic church there is also known: remains of its decoration are preserved in the Museum of Valladolid. After the Umayyad conquest of Hispania, the area was reconquered by Christians under Alfonso III of Asturias, who reigned 866–910. It seems that with the subsequent repopulation, Wamba's then existing church was rebuilt. The oldest part of the current church is dated to the 10th century. There are documentary records of a monastery in Wamba at this time of which the church is assumed to have been part. It was perhaps the first Mozarabic church in the area. Architecture It has been suggested that Wamba was repopulated by people coming from the north and that for this reason the architecture is closer to the Visigothic and Asturian influences than other buildings in the region such as the church at San Cebrián de Mazote, a village which was repopulated by Christians who came from Al-Andalus.

He was also the Landheer (landlord) of the particuliere land (private domain) of Gaboes. Today, he is best known as the father of the late colonial statesman Hok Hoei Kan (1881—1951). Born in Surabaya, East Java, Dutch East Indies in 1856, Han Oen Lee Sia came from the influential Han family of Lasem, part of the 'Cabang Atas' gentry of colonial Indonesia. His father, Han Tjoei Hing Sia (died in 1882), was a local landlord and a great-grandson of Han Khee Bing, Luitenant der Chinezen (1749—1768), who was in turn the eldest son of Han Bwee Kong, Kapitein der Chinezen of Surabaya (1727—1778), an important ally and comprador of the Dutch East India Company. As the issue of a long line of Chinese officers, Han bore the hereditary title of Sia from birth. On March 8, 1876, Han married the heiress Kan Oe Nio (1850—1910), who was six years his senior, at the bride's hometown of Batavia, capital of the Dutch East Indies. Han's wife was a daughter of one of the colony's wealthiest tycoons, Kan Keng Tjong (1797—1871), and Jo Heng Nio (1827—1900), as well as a sister-in-law of Lie Tjoe Hong, the 3rd Majoor der Chinezen of Batavia. Han and his wife had three children: Han Khing Bie Sia (1878—1864), Han Khing Tjiang Sia (later known as Hok Hoei Kan) and Han Tek Nio (1883—1969). On April 15, 1886, Han Oen Lee Sia was appointed by the Dutch colonial government to the post of Luitenant der Chinezen of Bekasi, a district located east of Batavia, in the region of Han's private domain of Gaboes (now in Bekasi Regency). There, Luitenant Han Oen Lee introduced a new variety of rice from Fujian in southern China, which had larger grains and produced a more plentiful harvest. Han also operated a steam-powered rice mill on the estate. Luitenant Han Oen Lee served in his government position until his untimely death due to a major fire in Batavia's Chinese quarter, Glodok, in 1893. Family lore recounts how the Luitenant climbed up to the roof of his family house, holding two sacred family krises, named Pangeran Api (prince of fire) and Pangeran Angin (prince of wind), thus magically diverting the fire away. Jakarta folklore has it that the fire leapt over the Molenvliet canal thanks to the magical power of the krises. Han, however, died from fire-related injuries a few days later. On his death, his eldest son, Han Khing Bie Sia, inherited Gaboes. His younger son, Han Khing Tjiang Sia, was adopted by his childless brother-in-law, Kan Tjeng Soen (1855—1896), renamed Kan Hok Hoei Sia and was made the principal heir of the name and fortune of the latter's maternal grandfather, Kan Keng Tjong. Han's youngest son, as Hok Hoei Kan, became a leading politician of the late colonial period.

Smuggling career The DEA started watching Guillot Lara in 1975, and estimated that by the late 70's he was delivering in excess of 400,000 pounds of marijuana into U.S. markets each year. During this time, he acquired partial or outright ownership of nearly a half-dozen motherships. In 1981, Guillot Lara met Cuban ambassador to Colombia Fernando Ravelo-Renedo, and agreed to pay 200,000 for each 10-ton marijuana shipment, in exchange for transit protection through Cuban waters. The tax was less than that levied on other traffickers, because Guillot Lara supported the budding M-19 guerrilla movement in Colombia. At the height of his wealth, he owned a housing development of 200 homes in Barranquilla, and a $300,000 house in South Miami. Connection with Colombia's M-19 In 1981, Guillot Lara provided financial and logistics support to Colombia's M-19 guerrillas during the execution of Operation Karina. He facilitated the purchase of a cargo ship in Germany, and 1,000 FN FAL rifles in Libya, and their transfer to Colombian waters and then across the Panama Canal. One of his marijuana smuggling vessels, El Monarca, was used to transfer part of the weapons to a clandestine airfield in Colombia's Guajira region. The weapons were then transported to the M-19's jungle in southern Colombia on board of a hijacked Curtiss C-46 owned by private carrier Aeropesca.https://www.aviacol.net/historia-aviacion/secuestro- curtiss-c46-hk388-aeropesca.html Guillot Lara made his smuggling infrastructure and manpower available to the M-19 during the operation, as well as long distance radio communication. Kidnapping In early 1981 Guillot was kidnapped in Miami by other drug dealers. He survived the ordeal. Metro-Dade police did not find out about it until Coral Gables police discovered his baby-blue Mercedes Benz 450SL riddled with bullets and submerged in a canal.https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA- RDP90-00552R000303490005-9.pdf The \\"Cuba Connection\\" indictment On Jan. 8, 1982 Guillot Lara was indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami along with several Cuban government officials, of drug trafficking. The indictment accused the Cuban officials of allowing Cuba to be used as a loading station and source of supplies for drug smugglers operating between Colombia and the U.S. between October 1979 and January 1981. The indictment also named Cuban Vice Adm. Aldo Santamaria, and Cuban ambassador to Colombia Fernando Rovelo- Renedo. According to the DEA's account, the smuggling operation depended on Guillot Lara's fleet of mother ships, all code-named \\"Viviana\\" for recognition by the Cuban navy. A week later, his Miami associate in drugs and arms, Johnny Crump, was also indicted on smuggling charges. In April 1982 Crump was given a 25-year suspended sentence with a six-year probation for cooperating with federal authorities. Extradition to Cuba In early 1982, Guillot Lara was jailed in Mexico City on marijuana conspiracy charges, and interrogated by the CIA. The agency was said to be particularly interested in reports of Guillot's ties with the Castro government and the M-19 guerrillas. After the details of Guillot Lara's indictment came to light, Cuban DGI agents approached the Mexican government to secure his release. In late 1982, Guillot Lara had been released from a Mexican prison and was in Cuba. Death Guillot Lara died in a Cuban prison of a heart attack in April 1991.https://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-61284 His remains were moved 4 years later to his native city of Santa Marta, Colombia.

It is planned to be 70 km in length, running from the town of Køge to the south of the city to Helsingør in northern Zealand. The motorway is designed to divert heavy goods traffic outside of the city, providing more space on existing motorways, in particular Køge Bugt Motorvejen, Holbækmotorvejen, Motorring 3, Frederikssundmotorvejen, Hillerødmotorvejen, og Helsingørmotorvejen. The motorway is planned to extend from the Køge Bugt motorway E47/E55/E20 and then west to Greve Strand and along a widened Tværvej. It will then connect to the Holbæk motorway and continue up towards Sengeløse to meet the Frederikssund motorway, the Hillerød motorway and Isterødvejen, ending with a connection to the existing Helsingør motorway south of the city. This would possibly then connect to a proposed link between Helsingør and Helsingborg in Sweden, the HH Tunnel The proposed route has met considerable opposition in North Zealand, to the extent that only the southern part between Køge and the Frederikssund motorway is currently under consideration. The proposed road has proved politically divisive, with some local politicians backing the project to reduce traffic on the other motorways in Greater Copenhagen and others opposed on environmental grounds. In 2019, a 2-year feasibility study of this section was announced by the government. The motorway was first proposed in the late 1970s, and in 1982 a 1 km wide strip of land running the length of the proposed route (a transport corridor) was reserved for its construction and/or a rail line by the authorities. This continued reservation has proved highly controversial for residents and businesses along the route that would be affected.

His work questions traditional gender identity roles through posed photographs of queer subjects in domestic spaces and situations.  Work  A photograph from the series Alone Time. Both subjects are portrayed by a single model, with differing gender presentations created by costuming, makeup, and posing. As is common with Levine's work, the subjects are depicted in an intimate domestic setting featuring saturated colors and textures. Levine is best known for his photographic series Queer Portraits, Alone Time, and Switch. Queer Portraits is a photography monograph of portraits featuring Levine's family and friends in different domestic settings over the years 2006–2015. The portraits were taken in selected and arranged settings with studio lighting. The use of saturated colors and textures gives clues as to the character of the subjects, who are photographed with a neutral expression. Subsequent works in a similar style include Family (2016) and Intimates (2018). Alone Time is a series of photographs with the same model depicting both the female and male members of a couple. Levine says of this series: > By demonstrating an individual body’s capacity to engagingly and believably > embody two genders, my project questions the mainstream depiction of binary > gender roles. This conceptual decision to double the gender presentation of > a single body challenges normative ideas surrounding gender presentation and > instead implies that gender expression can be fluid and multiple. Switch is a series of diptychs, each depicting the same two models, but with opposite gender presentations in each photograph. For Switch and Alone Time, each model's gender presentation was depicted based on costuming, makeup, and posing, without any digital manipulation except for compositing the images. Levine only works with personal acquaintances, normally in their own homes. According to Levine, his images are intended to, \\"celebrate marginality from a place of familiarity and self-exploration as opposed to voyeurism\\". Of Alone Time, Levine said, \\"by demonstrating an individual body's capacity to engagingly and believably embody two genders, my project questions the mainstream depiction of binary gender roles\\". Levine shoots on film. Levine has received grants from the Canada Council for the Arts and the Conseil des arts et des lettres du Québec.  Personal life  Levine is transgender. He began photography as a child when his mother, a documentary filmmaker, gave him a camera.

On opening, the station served the relatively new village of Shotton Colliery, which grew around the nearby Shotton Grange Colliery, as well as Old Shotton on the Stockton to Sunderland turnpike road, further to the east.  History  = The Hartlepool Dock & Railway = Construction of the HD&R; was first authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained on 1 June 1832 which granted the railway company powers to construct a 14-mile railway from Moorsley (near Houghton-le-Spring) to Hartlepool, as well as a number of short branches to serve collieries surrounding the line and a further Act of 16 June 1834, authorised an additional branch to Gilesgate in the City of Durham. However competition from other railway companies (most notably the Durham & Sunderland Railway (D&SR;)) diverted much of the traffic that the company had been intending to access along other routes thus meaning that the H&DR; only reached as far as and most of its branches were either cut short or left unbuilt. Nonetheless, the curtailed line opened (as far as Haswell) on 23 November 1835. Passenger services were operated over the line but no station was initially provided at Shotton: the nearest stations at the time was . The most likely reason for there initially being no station provided in this locality is the fact that the area was rural when the line first opened in 1835: the line passed some distance from Old Shotton and the fairly deep Permian Magnesian Limestone overlying Carboniferous Coal Masures meant that large-scale mining activity had yet to begin in the area. Sinking of Shotton Grange Colliery began in 1840 and, once in production, it was linked, first, to the southbound H&DR; route by the Shotton Wagonway and, later in 1841, to the northbound Pesspool Branch of the South Hetton Railway. = The NER and the opening of the station = In 1846, the newly formed York & Newcastle Railway (Y&NR;) took out a lease on the HD&R; which was ratified by an Act of 22 July 1848, from which point the line was operated by the York, Newcastle & Berwick Railway (YN&BR;) (the successor to the Y&NR;). On the 31 July 1854, the YN&BR; was amalgamated with other companies to form the North Eastern Railway. The NER initiated a programme of improvements to ex-HD&R; and ex-D&SR; lines during the 1870s and, in 1877, a chord was built at to allow passenger trains to run between these two lines, thus creating a through-route between West Hartlepool and Sunderland. By this time, the new village of Shotton Colliery (referred to as New Shotton on early OS maps) had developed to provide housing for the colliery workers and so, as part of these improvement works, in 1877 the NER also opened an additional station at Shotton Bridge to serve this new community. The station had two platforms, each with a brick waiting room while the station offices were located on a widened road bridge over the tracks and was linked to the platforms by covered stairways. Unlike other contemporary stations of the NER, the station never had any goods facilities, perhaps due to the colliery being served by its own wagonway branch. However, in the same year that the station was opened, Shotton Grange Colliery, and its waggonway, closed (the limited technology at the time having made it uneconomical to extract coal at the depths at which they were present) meaning that the village lost its main source of employment. Thus, in 1894 it was reported that many of the village's workmen's houses were abandoned. As a result, in 1901, the station served a population of 959 within the immediate vicinity but the reopening of the colliery (and the southern section of the wagonway) later that year led the population in the station's immediate catchment to increase to 6,280 by 1911. = Decline and closure = Despite the improvements of the 1870s, the route through Shotton Bridge continued to provide a steep and indirect route between West Hartlepool and Sunderland and so, on 1 April 1905, the NER opened a new coastal line linking the former Londonderry, Seaham & Sunderland Railway at with the ex-HD&R; line near the coast at . The new line allowed the steepest sections of the inland route to be bypassed and thus led to the gradual diversion of much of the longer-distance traffic away from Shotton Bridge station and onto the new line. The NER became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) as part of the 1923 grouping, which in turn came under the control of the North Eastern Region of British Railways following its nationalisation in 1948. By this time, passenger and goods traffic across the country was in decline and this was also the case for the route from West Hartlepool to Sunderland through Shotton Bridge. The route lost its stopping passenger services (south of ) on 9 June 1952 and though many of the stations on the line remained open to goods traffic until 1966, the lack of goods handling facilities meant that Shotton Bridge station closed completely when passenger services ceased. The line was, however, still used by Sunday diversions until the section through Haswell was dismantled in the late 1960s and a single line through the station was maintained to provide a southerly outlet for coal from South Hetton and Hawthorn Collieries until around the time of the 1984 miner's strike. Shotton Grange Colliery continued to be served by the remaining section of waggonway until its closure in 1972. Shortly before the station's closure, the new town of Peterlee was established in 1948 and was to be located a short distance to the east of Shotton Colliery. However, by the time construction of the town had actually commenced, the station had already closed. Once the remaining tracks were lifted on the line, work commenced on converting the disused section (south of Haswell) into the Hart to Haswell Walkway which was linked into the Castle Eden Walkway to form a continuous north-south cycleway. This was eventually extended to Ryhope after the closure of the remaining section of the line between Hawthorn Colliery and Junction in 1991.

The reported presence of methane in the atmosphere of Mars is of interest to many geologists and astrobiologists, as methane may indicate the presence of microbial life on Mars, or a geochemical process such as volcanism or hydrothermal activity. Since 2004, trace amounts of methane (range from 60 ppbv to under detection limit (< 0.05 ppbv)) have been reported in various missions and observational studies. The source of methane on Mars and the explanation for the enormous discrepancy in the observed methane concentrations are still unknown and are under study. Whenever methane is detected, it is rapidly removed from the atmosphere by an efficient, yet unknown process.  History of detections  Model of a methane (CH4) molecule Methane (CH4) is chemically unstable in the current oxidizing atmosphere of Mars. It would quickly break down due to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun and chemical reactions with other gases. Therefore, a persistent or episodic presence of methane in the atmosphere may imply the existence of a source to continually replenish the gas. The first evidence of methane in the atmosphere was measured by ESA's Mars Express orbiter with an instrument called the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer.Is Mars' Methane Spike a Sign of Life? Here's How We'll Know. Daniel Oberhaus, Wired. 24 June 2019. In March 2004, the Mars Express science team suggested the presence of methane in the atmosphere at a concentration of about 10 ppbv. This was confirmed soon after by three ground-based telescope teams, although large differences in the abundances were measured between observations taken in 2003 and 2006. This spatial and temporal variability of the gas suggests that the methane was locally concentrated and probably seasonal. It is estimated that Mars must produce 270 ton/year of methane. In 2011, NASA scientists reported a comprehensive search using ground-based high-resolution infrared spectroscopy for trace species (including methane) on Mars, deriving sensitive upper limits for methane (< 7 ppbv), ethane (< 0.2 ppbv), methanol (< 19 ppbv) and others (H2CO, C2H2, C2H4, N2O, NH3, HCN, CH3Cl, HCl, HO2 – all limits at ppbv levels). Curiosity rover detected a cyclical seasonal variation in atmospheric methane. In August 2012, the Curiosity rover landed on Mars. The rover's instruments are capable of making precise abundance measurements, but cannot be used to distinguish between different isotopologues of methane and so it cannot determine if it is geophysical or biological in origin.Curiosity Detects Unusually High Methane Levels. Andrew Good, NASA. Press release on 23 June 2019. However, the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) can measure these ratios and point to their origin. The first measurements with Curiosity Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS) in 2012 indicated that there was no methane —or less than 5 ppb— at the landing site, later calculated to a baseline of 0.3 to 0.7 ppbv.On Mars, atmospheric methane—a sign of life on Earth—changes mysteriously with the seasons. Eric Hand, Science Magazine. 3 January 2018. In 2013, NASA scientists again reported no detection of methane beyond a baseline. But in 2014, NASA reported that the Curiosity rover detected a tenfold increase ('spike') in methane in the atmosphere around it in late 2013 and early 2014. Four measurements taken over two months in this period averaged 7.2 ppbv, implying that Mars is episodically producing or releasing methane from an unknown source. Before and after that, readings averaged around one-tenth that level. On 7 June 2018, NASA announced the confirmation of a cyclical seasonal variation in the background level of atmospheric methane. The largest concentration of methane detected in situ by the Curiosity rover shows a spike to 21 ppbv, during an event in late June 2019. The Mars Express orbiter happened to be performing spot tracking in that area 20 hours before Curiosity methane detection, as well as 24 and 48 hours after the detection, and the TGO was performing atmospheric observations at around the same time but at a higher latitude. The Indian Mars Orbiter Mission, which entered orbit around Mars on 24 September 2014, is equipped with a Fabry–Pérot interferometer to measure atmospheric methane, but after entering Mars orbit it was determined that it was not capable of detecting methane,India's Mars Orbiter Mission Has a Methane Problem. Irene Klotz, Seeker, 7 December 2016. so the instrument was repurposed as an albedo mapper.Global Albedo Map of Mars. ISRO. 2017-07-14 As of April 2019, the TGO showed that the concentration of methane is under detectable level (< 0.05 ppbv). The Perseverance rover and the Rosalind Franklin rover will not be equipped to analyze the atmospheric methane nor its isotopes, so the proposed Mars sample-return mission in the mid-2030s seems the earliest a sample could be analyzed to differentiate a geological vs biological origin.  Potential sources  Possible methane sources and sinks on Mars. = Geophysical = The principal candidates for the origin of Mars' methane include non-biological processes such as water-rock reactions, radiolysis of water, and pyrite formation, all of which produce H2 that could then generate methane and other hydrocarbons via Fischer–Tropsch synthesis with CO and CO2. It has also been shown that methane could be produced by a process involving water, carbon dioxide, and the mineral olivine, which is known to be common on Mars. The required conditions for this reaction (i.e. high temperature and pressure) do not exist on the surface but may exist within the crust.Team Finds New Hope for Life in Martian Crust. Astrobiology.com. Western University. 16 June 2014. Detection of the mineral by-product serpentinite would suggest that this process is occurring. An analog on Earth suggests that low-temperature production and exhalation of methane from serpentinized rocks may be possible on Mars. Another possible geophysical source could be ancient methane trapped in clathrate hydrates that may be released occasionally. Under the assumption of a cold early Mars environment, a cryosphere could trap such methane as clathrates in a stable form at depth, that might exhibit sporadic release. On modern Earth, volcanism is a minor source of methane emission, and it is usually accompanied by sulfur dioxide gases. However, several studies of trace gases in the Martian atmosphere have found no evidence for sulfur dioxide in the Martian atmosphere, which makes volcanism on Mars unlikely to be the source of methane. Although geologic sources of methane such as serpentinization are possible, the lack of current volcanism, hydrothermal activity or hotspots are not favorable for geologic methane. It had also been proposed that the methane might be replenished by meteorites entering the atmosphere of Mars, but researchers from the Imperial College London found that the volumes of methane released this way are too low to sustain the measured levels of the gas. It has been suggested that the methane was produced by chemical reactions in meteorites, driven by the intense heat during entry through the atmosphere. Although research published in December 2009 ruled out this possibility, research published in 2012 suggest that a source may be organic compounds on meteorites that are converted to methane by ultraviolet radiation. A group of Mexican scientists found that bursts of methane can be produced when a discharge interacts with water ice by performing plasma experiments in a synthetic Mars atmosphere. The discharges from the electrification of dust particles from sand storms and dust devils may produce about 1.41×1016 molecules of methane per joule of applied energy. Current photochemical models cannot explain the apparent rapid variability of the methane levels in Mars. Research suggests that the implied methane destruction lifetime is as long as ≈ 4 Earth years and as short as ≈ 0.6 Earth years. This unexplained fast destruction rate also suggests a very active replenishing source. A team from the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics suspects that the methane detected by the Curiosity rover may have been released from a nearby area called Medusae Fossae Formation located about 500 km east of Gale crater. The region is fractured and is likely volcanic in origin. = Biogenic = Living microorganisms, such as methanogens, are another possible source, but no evidence for the presence of such organisms has been found on Mars. In Earth's oceans, biological methane production tends to be accompanied by ethane (). The long-term ground-based spectroscopic observation did not find these organic species in the Martian atmosphere. Given the expected long lifetimes for some of these species, emission of biogenic organics seem to be extremely rare or currently non-existent. The reduction of carbon dioxide into methane in the presence of hydrogen can be expressed as follows: :CO2 + 4 H2 -> CH4 + 2 H2O (∆G˚' = -134 kJ/mol CH4) Some of the CO2 reacts with the hydrogen to produce methane, which creates an electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane, used to generate ATP through chemiosmosis. In contrast, plants and algae use water as their reducing agent. Measuring the ratio of hydrogen and methane levels on Mars may help determine the likelihood of life on Mars. A low H2/CH4 ratio in the atmosphere (less than approximately 40) may indicate that a large part of atmospheric methane could be attributed to biological activities, but the observed ratios in the lower Martian atmosphere were \\"approximately 10 times\\" higher \\"suggesting that biological processes may not be responsible for the observed CH4\\". Since the 2003 discovery of methane in the atmosphere, some scientists have been designing models and in vitro experiments testing the growth of methanogenic bacteria on simulated Martian soil, where all four methanogen strains tested produced substantial levels of methane, even in the presence of 1.0 wt% perchlorate salt. Methanogens do not require oxygen or organic nutrients, are non-photosynthetic, use hydrogen as their energy source, and carbon dioxide (CO2) as their carbon source, so they could exist in subsurface environments on Mars. If microscopic Martian life is producing the methane, it probably resides far below the surface, where it is still warm enough for liquid water to exist. Research at the University of Arkansas published in 2015 suggested that some methanogens could survive on Mars' low pressure similar to a subsurface liquid aquifer on Mars. The four species tested were Methanothermobacter wolfeii, Methanosarcina barkeri, Methanobacterium formicicum, and Methanococcus maripaludis. A team led by Gilbert Levin suggested that both phenomena—methane production and degradation—could be accounted for by an ecology of methane-producing and methane-consuming microorganisms. Even if rover missions determine that microscopic Martian life is the seasonal source of the methane, the life forms probably reside far below the surface, outside of the rover's reach. Potential sinks It was initially thought that methane is chemically unstable in an oxidizing atmosphere with UV radiation and so its lifetime in the Martian atmosphere should be about 400 years, but in 2014, it was concluded that the strong methane sinks are not subject to atmospheric oxidation, suggesting an efficient physical-chemical process at the surface that \\"consumes\\" methane, generically called a \\"sink\\". A hypothesis postulates that the methane is not consumed at all, but rather condenses and evaporates seasonally from clathrates. Another hypothesis is that methane reacts with tumbling surface sand quartz (silicon dioxide ) and olivine to form covalent Si – bonds. The researchers showed that these solids can be oxidized and gases are ionized during the erosion processes. Thus, the ionized methane reacts with the mineral surfaces and bonds to them.Saltation may be contributory in the depletion of methane on Mars.

A beta version of the app was launched on July 2, 2018, and is still undergoing beta testing. While other applications exist which serve similar functions, MYmta is an all-in-one source for data provided directly by the MTA.  Functionality  MYmta is intended to combine MTA functionalities that are already available in separate apps such as Subway Time, Bus Time, and the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) and Metro-North Railroad Train Time applications into one all-encompassing application. The app also includes trip planning and paratransit functionalities, and will eventually include fare payment options as well. Since its launch, the app has been in the testing phase, and thus the MTA is seeking feedback from users on what functionality customers would like to see included in the application. = Live information = Similar to the MTA's Subway Time app, MYmta includes live subway arrival times. Similarly, the app also includes live bus arrival times and map tracking with functionality similar to that found in the MTA Bus Time app. = Trip planning = Unlike previous iterations of MTA trip planners, the version included within MYmta also supports modes of transportation not operated by the MTA, such as the Staten Island Ferry, NYC Ferry, PATH, and NJ Transit services. MYmta can also save users' favorite trips, stations, and stops, so information about them can be accessed quickly. The app also displays up-to-date information about delays and service changes so users can plan trips accordingly. = Paratransit and accessibility = MYmta allows paratransit users to request services through Access-A-Ride, the MTA's paratransit offering. In addition, the app reports statuses and outages of elevators and escalators in accessible stations, extending the functionality also performed by the similarly named My MTA Alerts service into application form. = Fare payment = , the app itself does not support any direct fare payment systems. However, it does link to the MTA eTix app for LIRR and Metro-North services after the user has chosen a route. Once the app leaves beta testing, though, the MTA has announced plans to combine eTix functionality into the MYmta app. In the future, the MTA also intends to add bus and subway fare payment options to the application as part of its new OMNY fare payment system.  History  The MTA began testing MYmta in April 2018 as a replacement for its existing suite of applications. The beta version app was released on July 2, 2018. I was largely received positively.

First Nation slaves were generally called Panis (anglicized to Pawnee), with most slaves of First Nations descent having originated from Pawnee tribes. The term later became synonymous with \\"Indian slave\\" in the French colony, with a slave from any tribe being called Panis. Etymology As early as 1670, a reference was recorded to a Panis in Montreal. The term is widely described as a corruption of the name of the Panismahas, a sub-tribe of the Pawnee people encountered in the Illinois Country, then a remote part of New France. > \\"In the middle of the 17th century the Pawnees were being savagely raided by > eastern tribes that had obtained metal weapons from the French, which gave > them a terrible advantage over Indians who had only weapons of wood, flint, > and bone. The raiders carried off such great numbers of Pawnees into > slavery, that in the country on and east of the upper Mississippi the name > Pani developed a new meaning: slave. The French adopted this meaning, and > Indian slaves, no matter from which tribe they had been taken, were > presently being termed Panis. It was at this period, after the middle of the > 17th century, that the name was introduced into New Mexico in the form > Panana by bands of mounted Apaches who brought large numbers of Pawnee > slaves to trade to the Spaniards and Pueblo Indians.\\":24 Raiders primarily targeted women and children, to be sold as slaves. In 1694, Apaches brought a large number of captive children to the trading fair in New Mexico, but for some reason there were not enough buyers, so the Apaches beheaded all their slaves in full view of the Spaniards.:46 History Slavery of First Nations in the colony of New France was formalized through colonial law in 1709, with the passage of the Ordinance Rendered on the Subject of the Negroes and the Indians called Panis. Slaves of First Nations descent were only permitted to be enslaved while within the colony, although in practice enslaved individuals remained enslaved regardless of where they travelled. In 1747, the colonial administration proposed permitting the trade of First Nations slaves for slaves of African descent. However, these attempts were quashed by the French government, fearing it would jeopardize existing Franco-First Nations alliances. By 1757 Louis Antoine de Bougainville considered that the Panis nation \\"plays ... the same role in America that the Negroes do in Europe.\\" However, the importation of slaves of First Nations descent began to decline in the decade prior to the British conquest of New France in 1760. A number of New French institutions, including the enslavement of First Nations, was extended into the British regime with the signing of the Articles of Capitulation of Montreal. By the late-18th century, slaves of African descent began to make up a larger portion of slaves imported into British North America. Several court decisions, and legislative acts passed in the Canadas during the late-18th and early 19th century resulted in the decline of the institution in the colonies. The last slave of First Nations descent in Lower Canada was recorded to have been donated to a Montreal hospital in 1821. The institution was abolished in 1834; at which time, the majority of the slaves in British North America were of African descent. Number enslaved According to the Canadian Museum of History 35 individuals were held as slaves in Canada from the establishment of New France to 1699. Most of these individuals were slaves of First Nations origin. From 1700 to 1760 the museum estimated 2,000 slaves were held in Canada; two-thirds of whom were First Nations people. The museum reported most slaves were very young, that the average age of First Nations slaves was just 14 years old. Their mortality was high, as most came from the interior, and lacked immunity to European diseases. From the mid-17th century to the abolition of slavery in 1834, there were approximately 2,683 slaves of First Nations descent; making up nearly two-thirds of all slaves in British North America during this period.Trudel, Marcel; d'Allaire, Micheline (2013) [1963].

The mausoleums are dated back to late 2nd century or early 3rd century A.D. These mausoleums are located close to the junction of historic military and trade routes, which were in north-south direction parallel to Euphrates and perpendicular to it in the west-east direction. The three mausoleums are situated very close to each other. They were built for wealthy, noble persons or high-ranked civil servants or military officers. Mausoleum of Elif The mausoleum is situated in the middle school's yard at Elif, which is a village of Gaziantep Province's Araban district. It is east of Araban town and northeast of Gaziantep. Elif was the ancient Toman settlement of Sugga, which was located close to the junction of the historic roads Doliche-Samosata and Zeugma- Samosata. The mausoleum is built of ashlar, and consists of a high basement, a body and a vaulted roof. While the western, southern and eastern facades of the mausoleum are arched, the northern facade is closed by a wall put up having a rectangular door opening in its underside. A decorative belt between the basement and the body showing heads of mythologic monster Medusa, who turned gazing people upon her to stone, surrounds the mausoleum. The mausoleum body has four columns of Corinthian order carrying arches. The form of the structure is unknown However, it is considered from the remains that the roof was vaulted. For the date of the mausoleum's construction late 2nd century or early 3rd century is given. The mausoleum underwent an almost one-year long restoration, which was completed in October 2013. Mausoleum of Hasanoğlu The mausoleum is situated inside the village of Hasanoğlu, which is located about west of Elif. The Mausoleum of Hasanoğlu is built in ashlar on a square- plan basement. Massive pillars on the southern and western facades carry arches. The northern and eastern facades completely as well as half of the basement are demolished. The mausoleum is dated to late 2nd century or early 3rd century. Mausoleum of Hisar Hisar village is located about east of Elif on the west bank of Euphrates. The mausoleum in Hisar is situated inside the village. It was built of ashlar on a flat platform. Four columns of Corinthian order on each corner of the square-plan basement of carry a pyramid-formed roof. There is square-formed column capital of Corinthian order at the top of the pyramidal roof. It is believed that a statue, which is no more existent today, was standing on the capital. The plain designed, high mausoleum is otherwise completely intact.

In the , Wivenhoe Hill had a population of 9 people.  Geography  The locality is beside Lake Wivenhoe, the impoundment created by the Wivenhoe Dam over the Brisbane River. As the name suggests, the locality is hilly with three named peaks: Wivenhoe Hill , Pine Hill and Wash Pool Knoll . For comparison the shoreline of the lake is above sea level depending on water levels in the dam. Although the locality is very close to the lake, the shoreline of the lake and the lake itself are within the locality of Lake Wivenhoe. The Brisbane Valley Highway passes from the very south-east of the locality to the south-west (Coominya). There are only a few roads in the locality; Logan Inlet Road provides access down to the lake shores for camping and recreational use. The principal land use in the locality is cattle grazing.  History  The locality takes its name from the hill () which in turn was named after a pastoral station operated by Edmund Blucher Uhr circa 1844, which in turn was named after Wivenhoe, a village in Essex, England. The hill is also called Bigges Hill after pastoralist and politician Francis Edward Bigge who operated the Mount Brisbane pastoral run in the district. The Wivenhoe pastoral station was historically beside the Brisbane River, but after the construction of Wivenhoe Dam across the river (opened 1984), the locality is now adjacent to Lake Wivenhoe.  Attractions  The Logan Inlet day-use area offers swimming, boating, fishing and picnic facilities. There are two campsites: Captain Logan camp ground and Lumley Hill camp ground.

The modern household registration system was started in early 20th century when Taiwan was under Japanese rule. Currently the system is administered by the Ministry of the Interior. Under Taiwanese law, household registration guarantees an individual the right of abode in Taiwan, and the ability to fully exercise their civil and political rights, such as the right to vote. Thus, the term national with household registration is sometimes used to refer to a citizen in official documents.  History  Early forms of household registration was first established in Dutch Formosa in 1647 by the Dutch East India Company. Later regimes including Kingdom of Tungning and the Qing Taiwan administration maintain similar registers on local family profiles of the Taiwanese people. In these eras, registers on families were also used to organize Taiwanese people to conduct civil defense, known as the Hoko system. The system existed until the era of Japanese rule. In the early 20th century during Japanese rule, the Government-General of Taiwan started to build very thorough household registration records for both families and persons, like the Koseki system implemented in Mainland Japan. The census in Taiwan was conducted in 1905, with the complete household registration records compiled in the next year according to the new law. The records established in 1906 forms the basis of modern household registration after the World War II until today. In the Japanese era, the household registration was maintained by the Japanese police, applications for registration can also be filed through Hoko offices. After the World War II, the competent authority household registration moved to civil administration. However, with the large number of refugees from the Chinese Civil War fleeing to Taiwan, the National Identification Card was issued first time in Taiwan in 1949 to enhance social control. Later, with the tension of the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, the competent authority of the household registration was transferred to the National Police Agency in 1969. The democratization process in Taiwan started in the early 1990s. Household registration was made independent of the police in July 1992. The nationwide computer system on managing household registration was established in October 1997.  Current implementation  = Administration = The household registration record is administered by the Department of Household Registration (), Ministry of the Interior in the central government. In every Taiwanese townships, county-administered cities and districts, there is at least one field Household Registration Office () which accepts applications and registrations from the public. Registration records were digitized in the early 1990s. The nationwide online Household and Conscription Information System () was completed in September 1997. The system is maintained by both the Department of Household Registration and National Conscription Agency to serve both the civil registration and conscription in Taiwan. = Registration = The current Household Registration Act requires reporting of the following status changes: * Household status change: Initial, separation and combination of household(s) * Personal status change: (1) Birth, (2) Parentage, (3) Adoption and Adoption Termination, (4) Marriage and Divorce, (5) Legal Guardianship, (6) Assistance, (7) Exercising responsibility of the rights and obligations for minor children, (8) Death and Presumption of Death, (9) Indigenous status and tribe group, and Birth Place Registration * Personal status of domicile change: (1) Moving-out, (2) Moving-in, (3) Address Alteration = Derived documents = The household registration authorities also in charge of issuing identity documents for persons and households, important documents includes: * National identification card: The identity document card issues to every person who with household registration in Taiwan when the person turns 14. The ID card is often used as proof of citizenship in circumstances like voting in national and local elections, and an ID number is needed for tax reporting or open bank accounts. The ID card also have limited ability to verify the person's close relatives, including parents, spouse, and siblings. * Household certificate: The identity document issued to every household. The certificate is usually used to verify the identify of children under 14, or as proof of relationship or domicile address in some applications. * Household registration transcript: The official copy of household registration records. It has the same format as the Household Certificate. Usually served as the one-time proof of relationship or domicile address in some applications. Other official copy of specific household registration records, including marriage certificate, divorce certificate, records of marriage, records of address changes, records of name changes are also available to apply in a Household Registration Office.  Household registration and citizenship  Under Taiwanese law, household registration guarantees an individual the right of abode in Taiwan, and the ability to fully exercise their civil and political rights, such as the right to vote. Thus, the term national with household registration is sometimes used to refer to a citizen in official documents. Note that under the current Taiwanese nationality law, a person with Taiwanese nationality does not necessarily have household registration. Although a national without household registration is eligible to apply for a Taiwan passport, these passports differ from those issued to Taiwanese citizens with the former having far more restrictions than the latter.Shelley Rigger, \\"Nationalism versus Citizenship on Taiwan,\\" in Changing Meanings of Citizenship in Modern China, Merle Goldman, Elizabeth Jean Perry ed.

It is one of the few games compatible with the Atari XG-1 light gun. As with all XEGS-branded cartridges, the game is compatible with the rest of the Atari 8-bit family.  Plot  The player takes on the role of a farm hand. The player and their grandpa decide to invest their life savings into a farm. However, once settled in, both notice that several rodents, birds, and other critters are threatening the farm. It is up to the unnamed player to take out the critters.  Gameplay  The goal of this game is to rid the farm of vermin by successfully hitting targets using the light gun in each of the game's three areas. These areas include, the barn, cornfield, and barnyard. The player must take out all enemies on screen by using less than 40 bullets. This forces the player to improve accuracy each round. If the player runs out of bullets before eliminating all critters, the game ends. There is a fourth bonus area called \\"Gramp's bonus screen.\\" This area allows players a chance to improve their shooting skill and earn extra points. This area is unlocked each time the player completes the other three areas successfully. Players are assigned a rank based on how many screens were completed before the game ends.

Cless, a paper products executive. The Minnesota Plan Cless joined the General Extension Division of the University of Minnesota in 1954. Her original job was to work with faculty members to set up civic, cultural, and liberal arts workshops. That led to involvement in programs to update the skills of professional women, including social workers, K-12 educators, and nurse anesthetists.Elizabeth L.

Soon a job offer reached Cless and the family moved to Claremont. The Claremont Colleges' Center for Continuing Education (CCE) opened its doors in 1966 with Cless as its Director.The Claremont Colleges Public Information Office, Press Release, October 30, 1969. CCE focused on people who wanted to acquire an interrupted or postponed degree in an existing college setting. It served a wide variety of students.Maggie Savoy, \\"They Went Collegiate to Renew Lives\\", Los Angeles Times, Section E, Sunday, February 2, 1969. Educational counseling and planning were key aspects of its program. One-on-one counselors helped students define and navigate choices and worked to accommodate their flexible and part-time attendance needs. Courses were made available at many educational institutions in addition to those in the Claremont cluster. Cless introduced two interdisciplinary liberal arts seminars at CCE in 1967 and a third seminar in 1968.

She was a key figure in Chicago's labor movement in the years just preceding the Haymarket affair, during which she worked with and played a leading role in a range of unions including the Knights of Labor and the International Working People's Association. Prior to becoming a labor organizer, she worked as a school teacher and music instructor in Ohio. In addition to her work as a labor organizer, Holmes served as a writer and editor in various radical and anarchist newspapers. She worked as the assistant editor of The Alarm, and she published articles in Lucifer, the Light-Bearer, Freedom, and Free Society. In contrast to some of her anarchist contemporaries, she was also willing to publish in more conservative outlets, which led to her publishing a string of articles in the American Federation of Labor affiliated journal American Federationist. Holmes published articles on a diverse array of topics, including free love, marriage, gender inequality, and economic injustice. Holmes also published multiple works of fiction, including a full-length novel entitled Hagar Lyndon; or, A Woman's Rebellion. Along with her close friend and collaborator Lucy Parsons, Holmes fought for and demonstrated the validity of gender equality within the anarchist and broader labor movement. Holmes has been recognized as an early pioneer of anarchist feminism, and an influence on more prominent thinkers like Emma Goldman. After the Haymarket affair, Holmes testified in court on behalf of her friend Albert Parsons. Following his execution and the subsequent crackdown on left-wing organizing in Chicago, many outlets Holmes had previously helped edit became defunct, including The Alarm. Holmes was under constant pressure from law enforcement following the Haymarket affair, serving a short time in jail with Lucy Parsons for agitation and anarchist organizing. Holmes and her husband left Chicago for the western United States, eventually settling in New Mexico, where she spent the last years of her life. Holmes continued to write for both radical and mainstream labor newspapers and magazines until 1908, when she retreated into a private life. Early life Lizze Holmes was born Elizabeth May Hunt in Iowa on December 21, 1850. She was the daughter of Jonathan Hunt (1822–1900) and the radical feminist Hannah Jackson Hunt (1825–1903), an occasional contributor to the free love journal Lucifer, the Light-Bearer. When Lizzie Hunt was four years old, her family moved to a \\"free love\\" commune in Berlin Heights, Ohio, which is where she spent her remaining childhood years. Holmes received a relatively early and advanced education, which allowed her to start teaching in a one-room schoolhouse in Ohio by the time she was fifteen. At the age of 17, Holmes married her first husband, Hiram J. Swank. Holmes continued teaching despite her marriage, insisting at an early age on some form of economic independence. Lizzie gave birth to two children by Swank, a son in 1868 and a daughter in 1873. The Swank family remained in Ohio for 12 years before Lizzie left for Chicago in 1879, inspired to get involved in the labor movement after reading about the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. According to Holmes, Hiram Swank died after five years of marriage, and Holmes left for Chicago accompanied only by her mother, her two brothers, and her children. The census records at the time do not confirm Swank's death, and it is possible that Holmes left Swank in Ohio and constructed a new public persona as a widow in Chicago. In either case, Swank does not play a role in the remainder of Lizzie's life. Organizing in Chicago Women delegates to the 1886 Convention of the Knights of Labor Upon her arrival in Chicago, Holmes began working as a seamstress in a cloak factory. She expressed some frustration at her inability to find work as a music teacher, but she ultimately viewed her seamstress job as formative for her politics, explaining in a later interview with the Chicago Times that she had a \\"desire to know the [working class] intimately\\" and that she learned \\"all the struggles, the efforts of genteel poverty, the pitiful pride with which working girls hide their destitution and drudgery from the world.\\" After little more than a year in Chicago, Lizzie joined the Working Women's Union, which at the time was an arm of the Socialist Labor Party of America. The Working Women's Union at the time was launching a campaign for an eight-hour work day, and Holmes became heavily involved in the effort. She was subsequently fired from her work as a seamstress due to her efforts to unionize her workplace, but Holmes remained undeterred in her affiliation with the union. She gave multiple public addresses at union meetings, and the popularity of her speeches eventually landed her a job as the union secretary. During her time as secretary, the Working Women's Union became an affiliate of the Knights of Labor, which at the time was among the most popular labor unions in the United States. Holmes played a prominent role in organizing garment industry workers in Chicago throughout her time as secretary, and by 1886, Holmes and her affiliated women activists had organized three different Knights of Labor assemblies representing garment industry workers. As secretary with the WWU, Holmes also met other prominent activists, including Lucy Parsons and Lizzie's eventual husband, the British anarchist William Holmes. Parsons introduced Lizzie Holmes to both socialism and anarchism, with Holmes quickly understanding the socialist critique of capitalism based on her time in the garment industry. Parsons also introduced Holmes to more radical organizations, and Holmes joined the anarchists in the International Working People's Association in 1885. Holmes's affiliation with the radical labor movement in Chicago also gave her multiple opportunities to write articles, which she took up in addition to her organizing work. Holmes became a prolific writer of both non-fiction articles and works of fiction throughout the 1880s, publishing stories and educational material in a variety of radical newspapers and magazines. Holmes wrote multiple articles decrying the horrific labor conditions she experienced in the garment factories, and her stories were picked up by newspapers like the Anti-Monopolist, Labor Enquirer, and Nonconformist. Holmes eventually served as the assistant editor of The Alarm, the newspaper of the International Working People's Association. Her editing work took some time away from labor organizing, but Holmes still found time to march with the seamstresses. On April 28, 1885, Lizzie Holmes and Lucy Parsons led a march on the newly build Chicago Board of Trade building, solidifying their reputation as leaders in the Chicago anarchist and labor movement. Their prominence constantly drew the ire of the authorities, who painted both Parsons and Holmes as dangerous terrorists. In November 1885, Lizzie married fellow anarchist William Holmes. Upon their marriage, they both moved out of Chicago and into Geneva, Illinois. Lizzie Holmes re-established herself as a school teacher in Geneva, but neither her nor William gave up on anarchist organizing. Both of them regularly returned to Chicago to organize with Albert and Lucy Parsons, including in the days directly preceding the Haymarket affair.  Haymarket and its aftermath  Lizzie Holmes returned to Chicago the day before the Haymarket affair. On May 3, 1886, Lizzie led a march of several hundred sewing women, demanding an eight-hour workday. The march was covered by the Chicago Tribune, who described the marching women as having \\"worn faces and threadbare clothing, bearing evidence of a struggle for an uncomfortable existence.\\" After the march, Lizzie briefly returned to Geneva, but she received a telegraph from Lucy Parsons instructing her to return to Chicago for the rally scheduled for May 4. The following morning, Holmes returned to Chicago and attended the anarchist rally that evening. The rally was suppressed by the Chicago police, and in the midst of the ensuing chaos, a bomb was thrown into the crowd. The bomb killed eleven people and injured dozens, in an event that quickly became infamous across the United States. Holmes and Lucy Parsons were uninjured by the bomb, but they quickly suspected that Albert Parsons would be among those blamed for the bombing. On the morning of May 5, Lucy and Lizzie went to the offices of the Alarm to find the Chicago police ransacking the building. Alarm was formally censured by the Chicago Police Department, and Holmes and Parsons were arrested in connection with inciting the bombing. They were quickly released due to lack of evidence, but Lucy grew more suspicious that they were going to charge her husband with a serious crime. An illustration of the Haymarket Riot in Harper's Magazine Albert Parsons had escaped the morning after the bombing, spending a short time with William Holmes in Geneva, later traveling to Wisconsin to evade the Chicago authorities. After his friends were arrested, however, Albert Parsons returned to Chicago and turned himself in to the authorities. During the trial of the Haymarket anarchists, Lizzie Holmes testified on behalf of Albert Parsons, claiming that he couldn't have possibly thrown the bomb due to him being with her in a café at the time the bomb was thrown. Holmes also claimed that anarchism was inherently non-violent, testifying that the \\"theory of anarchy is opposed to all idea of force.\\"Holmes, \\"Transcript of Witness Testimony,\\" People for the State of Illinois vs. August Spies et al. In spite of her testimony, Parsons was sentenced to death by hanging. Many of the anarchist organizations and institutions previously built up by Lizzie Holmes came under both legal and public scrutiny following the Haymarket Affair, as public opinion turned against anarchism. The Alarm came back, with Lizzie as editor, but under the shadow of Haymarket, it never achieved the same level of attention or interest. Lizzie Holmes was investigated by the authorities on multiple occasions, and under the threat of legal duress, she moved away from the level of radical organizing that had occupied so much of her life in previous years. Holmes and her husband moved to Colorado in 1889, eventually settling in New Mexico in the mid-1890s. Despite these circumstances, Holmes still found time to write for various newspapers and magazines. During the early years of the 1890s, Holmes wrote a novel entitled Hagar Lyndon; or, A Woman's Rebellion, which she published serially in Lucifer, the Light-Bearer in 1893. Holmes would also write for other radical newspapers, including the newly formed Free Society, which she contributed to with her husband. Holmes would eventually write a series of short stories for the American Federation of Labor, in a move criticized by some other anarchists as too accommodating, as the American Federation of Labor was far more conservative than many anarchist labor unions. Holmes did not shy away from radical politics in the stories she wrote for the American Federationist, however, and in subsequent years, the stories have been praised by labor scholars as interesting encapsulations of the labor movement that Holmes inhabited.  Later years and death  Holmes continued to write for various radical newspapers until 1908, after which she quietly left public life. Holmes and her husband lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico during the bulk of her late years, until they moved to Santa Fe in 1926. That same year, on August 8, Lizzie Holmes died in her home at the age of 75. Two years later, in 1928, her husband William Holmes followed her at the age of 78. Legacy Holmes was instrumental in building the labor movement in Chicago, and many of the ideas that she advocated for only came to fruition following her death. Holmes was a constant figure in the fight for the eight-hour workday, a demand that would become federal law in the United States in 1938 under Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. Within the anarchist movement itself, Lizzie Holmes never reached the level of recognition achieved by names like Emma Goldman and Voltarine de Cleyre, but she has been recognized as an early influence on much of their work. Her willingness to talk about gender inequality in stark terms, as well as her fierce devotion to women's liberation, has led to some scholars like Jessica Moran calling her an early anarchist feminist. Contemporary labor scholars have also begun to re-examine her fiction as a source for late 19th century labor history, with scholars like Ruth Percy and Blaine McKinley mining her short stories for nuggets of truth regarding the labor movement and its relationship to the conditions of the working class in the United States.

On February 15, 1992 the Douglas DC-8 operating the flight crashed during a second go-around attempt at Toledo Express Airport, killing all four people on board. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the accident was caused by pilot error due to the aircraft's control not being maintained.  Aircraft and crew  =Aircraft= The aircraft involved was a Douglas DC-8-63F (registration N794AL), that had its maiden flight in 1968. It was initially a passenger aircraft and was delivered to Scandinavian Airlines on August 16 the same year. It then operated for Icelandair, Thai Airways, and TransOcean Airways, before being converted into a freighter and sold to Burlington Air Express. The aircraft was powered by four Pratt & Whitney JT3D-7 turbofan engines.  Previous incident  On November 13, 1991, while operating a flight from Toledo to Los Angeles (for Flagship Express), the accident aircraft's cargo door opened after takeoff from Toledo. The aircraft (sustaining minor damage) was able to land safely, and the three crew members survived with no injuries. The failure of the cargo door had been caused by the flight engineer failing to verify that the door was closed properly. The flight crew was unaware of the improperly closed door as damaged wiring caused the door indicator light to go out despite the door itself not having been closed properly. In addition, the door had been improperly installed with weak locks. = Crew = The captain was 59-year-old Harry Baker, who had 16,382 flight hours, including 2,382 hours on the DC-8. The first officer was 37-year-old Tim Hupp who had 5,082 flight hours, with 3,135 of them on the DC-8 (1,148 hours as a flight engineer and 1,992 hours as a first officer). The flight engineer was 57-year-old Jose Montalbo, who had 21,697 flight hours, including 7,697 hours on the DC-8. Ramon Papel, a pilot at Buffalo Airways, was also on board as a non-revenue passenger.  Accident  Flight 805 departed from Seattle on-time at 21:45 Eastern Standard Time (EST). First officer Hupp was the pilot flying. The flight was uneventful until it approached Toledo. Flight 805 was cleared for an ILS approach to runway 07 with the controller advising the crew about light to moderate precipitation. At 03:02, Flight 805 was cleared to land, and captain Baker acknowledged the transmission. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) then recorded the flight crew going over the landing checklist. After this however, captain Baker started complaining to first officer Hupp that he was flying too slow with the flaps not having been extended into the landing configuration. He even told him, \\"You're not even on the [expletive] localizer at all.\\" In other words, the aircraft had failed to capture the localizer and was below the glide path, resulting in an unstable approach. Baker subsequently declared a go-around at 03:13. When the approach controller asked Flight 805 on why they initiated go-around, captain Baker responded, \\"We lost the localizer close in there...couldn't position ourselves on final...we had the glidepath, but not the localizer.\\" The approach controller gave Flight 805 a 100 degree heading for another approach. During the second approach the aircraft managed to capture the localizer, with captain Baker advising first officer Hupp about the wind conditions. At 03:21, Flight 805 was again cleared to land on runway 07. However, the approach became destabilized again, with the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) sounding three \\"glideslope\\" warnings and three \\"sink rate\\" warnings. There were also three changes in power. At 03:24, Baker told Hupp that he was taking over control of the aircraft and initiated another go- around. At 03:25, first officer Hupp reported the go-around to the tower controller and were instructed to climb and maintain and then turn left onto a 300 degree heading. However the aircraft began to bank 80 degrees and pitch up 25 degrees. Captain Baker transferred control of the aircraft back to first officer Hupp and asked him if he had the control, to which he responded, \\"I got it.\\" Hupp then attempted to raise the aircraft's nose and level the wings, but was unable to recover control. At 03:26 the aircraft crashed into the ground away from runway 07. All four people on board were killed instantly, and the aircraft was destroyed. Parts of the aircraft landed in the backyard of a house. No one on the ground was killed, but thirteen people on the ground were injured; one person in the house that the debris landed near was injured by falling plaster caused by the force of the impact, and 12 firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation.  Investigation  During the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation both flight recorders were recovered. Investigators discovered that when captain Baker took control, he became spatially disoriented and accidentally caused the plane to enter an unrecoverable bank and attitude. The NTSB also focused on the aircraft's attitude indicators (ADI), human factors, the power changes by using the Flight Data Recorder (FDR), and the manner of first officer Hupp's approach. Because of the aircraft's previous cargo door incident, the NTSB considered the possibility that the aircraft had once again experienced a cargo door opening mid-flight. Seven door latches were found; one of which had lost its latch pins on impact. If the cargo door had opened in mid-flight the CVR would suddenly record a loud sound of rushing air. Flight 805's CVR did not record this, nor the flight crew did bring up any abnormal sounds. The crew also didn't bring up the door warning light. Thus, the NTSB concluded that the cargo door had been functioning normally. The ADI malfunction was the most likely scenario, as the NTSB was unable to determine its readings at impact. However, only one ADI was recovered and had been severely damaged from the crash. The NTSB alluded to previous accidents which involved ADI malfunctions. The NTSB did believe that the first officer's ADI was functioning normally at the time of the accident because of his immediate response to captain Baker transferring control of the aircraft back to him, and properly executing the recovery attempt. The NTSB stated: In addition, the flight crew's interactions were not representing proper crew resource management (CRM). The NTSB was also unable to determine why the first officer caused the aircraft to destabilize on approach. The NTSB released the final report on November 19, 1992, with the \\"probable cause\\" stating: The NTSB was unable to determine with absolute certainty if any of these aforementioned factors had caused or contributed to the accident. The NTSB could not determine the time that control of the aircraft was lost.  Aftermath  The NTSB did not issue any recommendations following the accident.

History  The New Zealand Supply Technician Trade can trace its lineage to 30 October 1840 with the appointment of Henry Tucker as the First Colonial Storekeeper of the Colony of New Zealand. For the years leading to 1911 the provision of Supply and Quartermaster support to the New Zealand Forces would be provided by a combination of the Civil Branch of the New Zealand Defence Forces, the Defence Stores Department and Regimental Quartermasters appointed from within the ranks of the various New Zealand military units. As the Defence Forces of New Zealand transitioned to the Territorial Army system in the early twentieth century, a more modern and responsive supply and quartermaster system was required to ensure the ongoing care, maintenance and responsibility of military equipment. In November 1911 thirty young men were selected from across the various New Zealand Military Districts and undertook three weeks specialist Quartermaster Training at the Defence Stores Department in Wellington. Undergoing practical and theoretical instruction in the duties of the office of Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant, the course provided instruction on; * Weapon storage, inspection, maintenance and accounting, * The storage, inspection and maintenance of leather items such as horse saddlery and harnesses. * The correct methods of storage, inspection and maintenance of canvas and fabric items such as tents, other camp canvas and fabric camp equipment. * Instruction on the packing of stores. * Instruction on ledger-keeping and the maintenance of stores accounting documentation. Examinations were held with records showing that at least 18 of the 30 candidates passed the exams successfully and were appointed as Regimental Quartermaster Sergeants in the New Zealand Permanent Staff under General Order 112/10. As the First World War came to a close it was found that the accounting, care, and custody of stores by New Zealand based units had been unsatisfactory with Regimental Quartermaster Sergeants and their Staff not carrying out their responsibilities in accordance with New Zealand Military Forces Regulations. As an emergency measure Eleven NZAOC Staff Sergeants were seconded to units to act as Quartermaster-Sergeants with units in an attempt to rectify the situation. This surge of NZAOC personnel was a success with further audits disclosing few if any deficiencies. To rectify the situation and prevent a re-occurrence, an amendment to Army regulations was published on 3 October 1918 to make the management of Quartermaster Sergeants a NZAOC responsibility. The financial constraints of the interwar years saw that the management of Quartermaster Sergeants as an NZAOC responsibility never followed through in its entirety and the Supply system of the New Zealand Army evolved into two systems, one under the control of the New Zealand Army Ordnance Corps providing 2nd to 4th line (Wholesale) support with Unit Quartermaster Stores providing 1st Line (retail) support. As a consequence of the 1993 re-balancing of the New Zealand Army, the RNZAOC Supplier trade and the All Arms Store-man trade we merged into one trade known as the Supply- Quartermaster Trade. The Supply-Quartermaster Trade was the re-branded as the Supply Technician Trade in October 2007.  Trade description  Supply Technicians are tasked with ensuring that all of the supplies and services necessary for New Zealand Army operations are available at the right place at the right time. The Supply Technician Trade is a multidisciplinary trade providing integral and close support to Army and Joint Force units with a variety of items such as food, fuel, vehicles, spare parts, stationery, clothing and field services. The principle responsibilities of New Zealand Army Supply Technicians are: * General Supply * Supply of Fuel Oil and Lubricants * Field services, including **Field Shower ** laundry ** Tyre Repair ** Mortuary Affairs New Zealand Army Supply Technicians can be found serving in all units of the New Zealand Army and Joint Forces in diverse international locations, including combat zones at forward operating bases in diverse locations such as East Timor, Iraq or Afghanistan.  Training  New Zealand Army Supply Technicians are primarily trained at the Supply Wing of Trade Training School at Trentham Camp.

It was adapted from the short story \\"Araby\\" by James Joyce, which was included in his short works collection Dubliners. Plot Based on the short story by Irish author James Joyce, Araby is the bittersweet tale of a young boy’s confused affection for his friend’s older sister. Taught by Jesuits in turn-of-the-century Dublin, and raised in a strict Catholic family, the boy worships her from afar. When she finally notices him, the girl expresses her sadness in not being able to attend the enchanting Araby bazaar. The boy nobly sets out to attain a gift for the girl, but instead meets with a harsh revelation. The boy’s romantic quest through the streets of Dublin becomes a religious pilgrimage, merging the sensual and the sacred. Film adaptation The filmmakers makes several adroit additions to Joyce’s text, including an episode in the schoolroom where a Christian Brother instructs the boys about the young martyr Tarsicius, whose exploit of carrying the Eucharist to Christian prisoners in Rome is only alluded to in Joyce’s text. In fact, Tarsicius is not even named in the story when the narrator records: “I bore my chalice safely through a throng of foes.\\" A second emendation is the expansion of the role of Mrs. Mercer, whom Joyce only mentioned in the story. In the film she confers with the protagonist’s aunt over the tea-table. For this dialogue, missing from the \\"Araby\\" text, the filmmakers went to ‘‘The Sisters,’’ the first story in Dubliners, as well as utilizing narration from \\"Araby\\" itself. Another significant change from the story in the handling of the Caroline Norton poem ‘‘The Arab’s Farewell to His Steed.’’ Joyce merely alludes to the poem, but in the film, the uncle in voice-over recites lines from it, which indisputably link the verses with the young man as he races down Buckingham Street to the special train at Westland Row Station that will take him to Araby. Production The production was completed in 8 days with a cast and crew of 40 people and a budget of $30,000. It was filmed on locations in the Richmond, Virginia, Portsmith, Virginia, New Hope, Pennsylvania and Asbury Park, New Jersey. Seamaisin, a group of musicians from University of Norte Dame recorded traditional Irish music for the film and the Dublin-based traditional group Kila also provided two songs for the soundtrack.

Joyce would be absolutely delighted with the beauty and magical power of this 21-minute film. “The filmmakers tell the story in a cinematic language that is brisk and impressionistic - like the experiences of a child - but pensive and mature at the same time.” “The film ultimately helps us to get at what Joyce critic Donald Torchiana calls the \\"mythic, religious and legendary patterns that Joyce seems to place so frequently at the very center of each story\\".” Awards * 1999 Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences - Student Academy Awards - Regional Winner and Finalist * 2000 Producer Guild of America - Santa Clarity Film Festival - Grand Award Drama * 2000 Broadcast Education Association - BEA 2000 - 1st Place Narrative Award * 2000 Saguaro Film Festival - Favorite Short Award * 2000 Angelus Awards - Mole-Richard Award * 2000 Hardacre Film Festival - Best Student Film * 2000 Magnolia Film Festival - Best Short - 2nd Place * 2000 Cine Eagle Award * 2000 Atlantic City Film Festival * 2000 Burbank Intl.

It is a multiplayer-only entry in the Bomberman franchise, featuring support for up to ten players and widely regarded by many to be the first commercially created game for widescreen HDTVs, as well as being regarded to be the basis for Saturn Bomberman, but it was never released for the general public.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Hi-Ten Bomberman is a multiplayer-only action-maze game that plays very similarly like other games in the Bomberman franchise, featuring support for up to ten players, with each one being assigned to a different colored Bomberman character depending on which controller port is used with the multitaps while utilizing a large, landscape-style HDTV widescreen to display its vast playfield. The main objective of the game is to defeat all of the opponents filling the playfield by placing bombs, while destroying the blocks in the mazes may uncover useful items for the players including extra bombs, fire range increasers and other items. = Modes = There are five different modes of play to choose from at the main title screen: Battle Royale, 2 Group Battle, 3 Group Battle, 5 Group Battle and 1 VS 9 Battle. Battle Royal, as the name implies, is a deathmatch mode between ten players where the last standing Bomberman becomes the winner. 2 Group Battle is a multiplayer mode where two teams consisting of five players battle against each other. 3 Group Battle is a nine-player-only battle mode in which three teams of three players are pitted against each other. 5 Group Battle is a cooperative multiplayer mode where five two-player teams battle to become the winner. 1 VS 9 Battle is a ten-player mode where one player is pitted against a large nine-player team.  History  = Development = Hi-Ten Bomberman was conceived by Katsuhiro Nozawa, who previously worked on several Hudson Soft titles such as Star Soldier and J.J. & Jeff. The game ran on a combination of two PC Engine units for basic hardware and controller inputs along with a custom PC-based PCB nicknamed Iron Man, which later became the basis for the PC-FX but no plans for a home release on the platform was considered. Between five and ten units were produced and each one cost around JP¥2,000,000. In an interview with Gamasutra, former Hudson Soft executive Takahashi Meijin stated that the reason for the company in developing the project was due to NHK wanting to push the HDTV market in Japan at the time and due to the expanded 16:9 aspect ratio, it allowed the team to have ten players on-screen but required writing a custom technology to do so. = Release = Hi-Ten Bomberman was first showcased to attendees at the 1993 Super Caravan event hosted by Hudson Soft and was last seen playable at Studio Park on the NHK Broadcasting Center in August 1997 in Japan, where it was available to play for the general public. It is widely credited by video game magazines and other dedicated outlets to be the first commercial game created for widescreen HDTVs, though Namco's 1988 Homerun Contest preceded it five years prior. Despite being showcased only in Japan, Hudson Soft had plans to showcase the game across other regions, which never came to fruition for unknown reasons. In 1994, an updated version of Hi- Ten Bomberman titled Hi-Ten Chara Bomb was first showcased by Hudson Soft to the attendees at the 1994 Super Caravan event, which increased the arena's size and introduced selectable characters, most of which were from other Hudson properties such as Bonk, Far East of Eden, Milon's Secret Castle and Momotaro Densetsu.  Reception and legacy  Both Edge and Next Generation praised Hi-Ten Bomberman for the gameplay and technological achievement. The game has been regarded to be the basis for Saturn Bomberman. In 2019, multiple discs containing data of the game were found by Takahashi Meijin.

Leeds and starring Sidney Toler, Lynn Bari, and Richard Clark. It is one of the films in the Charlie Chan film series, the fourth starring Toler, and was released on December 1, 1939. Plot Charlie Chan (Sidney Toler) is visiting Paris during the Czech annexation crisis in September 1938, but is having trouble finding a way to return to the United States, since there are transportation disruptions due to the threat of the impending war and the Munich Crisis. While visiting the office of the Chief of Police Romaine (C. Henry Gordon), who is away on business, word is received that Petroff (Douglass Dumbrille), a well-known millionaire, has been murdered. Romaine's bumbling godson, Police Inspector Marcel Spivak (Harold Huber) has been left in charge during the chief's absence, and is terrified of handling such a high profile murder investigation. He asks for Chan's assistance, which is agreed to. Spivak suspects his butler, Antoine (Pedro de Cordoba), but spy Charlotte Ronnell (Dorothy Tree) is spotted fleeing the residence. Due to a chance encounter earlier, Chan realizes that local woman Marie Dubon (Lynn Bari) is involved, and the two detectives head to her hotel. Charlie learns that Dubon was helping her husband, Tony Madero (Richard Clarke), clear his name after Petroff accused him of smuggling. Following a clue in Dubon's room, Chan interrogates counterfeiter Louis Santelle (Leo G. Carroll). Returning to the Petroff household, Chan and Spivak track down burglars Lola (Barbara Leonard), Max (Louis Mercier), and Alex (George Davis) (who had broken into Petroff's house just before the murder) before interrogating Petroff's business partner, Belescu (Noel Madison). After nearly being killed by Santelle, Charlie realizes that three clues are the key to the case: A dropped franc coin, a wooden leg, and a telephone left off the hook. After Belescu is shot, Chan and Spivak chase Ronnell to Le Bourget Airport. But her plane crashes during takeoff and she dies. Chan returns to police headquarters, and reveals that Antoine (a French patriot) killed Petroff after returning home early and discovering that Petroff was selling arms to Nazi Germany. Prefect Romaine says Antoine will likely stand trial for murder, but is likely to receive the Legion of Honour instead of the guillotine.

He is often referred to as the first non-white person to play at the Masters; this is false. The Japanese golfers Torakichi Nakamura and Koichi Ono played in the 1958 Masters Tournament well before Onsham. Also several other players from Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines played in the event during the 1960s. Onsham had much success in 1972 on the international circuit.

On 23 October 1972, Onsham finished runner-up to American Bob Murphy at the 1972 Wills Masters, an event on the Australian Tour held outside of Sydney. Two weeks later he posted another runner-up in Australia at the Dunlop International, four shots behind Tony Jacklin, finishing tied for second with David Graham.

Hayes (born 12 November 1952) is the president of Community Healthcare Network since 2014. Before working in healthcare, Hayes primarily worked in law at multiple firms throughout the United States from 1977 to 2001. During his law career, Hayes started the 1979 lawsuit Callahan v. Carey where he was ruled in favor of making New York homeless shelters available based on the New York Constitution. Hayes extended his work with the homeless after creating the National Coalition for the Homeless in 1982 and was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1985. Upon moving to healthcare in 2001, he worked at Medicare Rights Center from 2001 to 2009 and Universal American from 2010 to 2014. Early life and education On 12 November 1952, Hayes was born in Brooklyn, New York. For his post-secondary education, Hayes went to Georgetown University for a Bachelor of Arts and a Juris Doctor from the New York University School of Law throughout the 1970s. Career In the early 1970s, Hayes began his career in journalism as an assistant editor for Passenger Transport and an investigative journalist for the Long Island Catholic Newspaper. After working as a legislative assistant in healthcare from 1975 to 1977, Hayes began practicing law with Sullivan & Cromwell in 1977. While working as a litigator for the law firm, Hayes conducted interviews with the homeless people of New York City and started the 1979 lawsuit Callahan v. Carey. In the case, the court ruled in favor of Hayes after he argued a 1938 amendment of the New York Constitution guaranteed the availability of homeless shelters. Hayes left Sullivan & Comwell in 1982 to create the National Coalition for the Homeless. He remained with the coalition until 1989 when he resumed his law career with the Los Angeles, California firm O'Melveny & Myers. In 1992, he moved to Portland, Maine to work with the law firm Moon, Moss, Gill & Bachelder. Hayes shifted from law to healthcare upon his move to Hartsdale, New York in 2001. At Medicare Rights Center, he was the senior vice-president for a year before his promotion to president in 2002. Hayes held his executive position until he resigned in 2009. Hayes extended his career in health as a member of the quality assurance department for Universal American between 2010 and 2014. At the end of 2014, Hayes became the president of Community Healthcare Network in New York. Awards and honors In 1985, Hayes was named a MacArthur Fellow.

A member of the CIA-trained Black Cat Squadron, he flew the American U-2 reconnaissance aircraft to spy on China's nuclear program. He was shot down on 10 January 1965 over Baotou, Inner Mongolia and held in mainland China for 17 years. Chang was released from custody in 1982, but not granted permission to return to Taiwan until 1990, living the interim years in the United States.  Early life  Chang was born in Nanjing, the capital of the Republic of China, on 7 November 1929. After the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese army attacked Nanjing in December 1937. Chang's mother fled the city with the children and trekked across China for more than a year, eventually arriving in the wartime capital Chongqing in 1939. His father, who stayed behind to look after his shop, died in the Nanjing Massacre. In 1943, the Republic of China Air Force established a youth training school in Dujiangyan, Sichuan. Chang, determined to join the military, took the entrance examination and was admitted the next year. Before his graduation, however, the Kuomintang government was losing the Chinese Civil War to the Communists and the school evacuated to Taiwan in 1948. His family was left behind in mainland China, where the Communist Party established the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949.  U-2 pilot and capture  Chang Liyi being received by President Chiang Kai-shek after one of his missions Wreckage of the U-2C piloted by Chang Liyi, on display at the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution, Beijing In the late 1950s, the United States and the Republic of China government in Taiwan initiated a top-secret reconnaissance program to spy on Communist China's nuclear bomb project. To reach the project sites located deep inland in Northwest China, ROC pilots were trained by the Central Intelligence Agency in the United States to fly the Lockheed U-2 high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft. Chang was selected to receive U-2 training and joined the Black Cat Squadron in July 1964 with the rank of major. After Communist China exploded its first nuclear bomb in October 1964, the Black Cat Squadron intensified its reconnaissance flights. On 10 January 1965, Chang flew a U-2C aircraft (No. 358) from Taiwan, on a mission to take infrared photographs of atomic bomb production facilities in Northwest China. When he flew over Baotou, Inner Mongolia, his plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missile launched by the 1st Battalion of the People's Liberation Army Air Force under the command of Wang Lin. When his plane was hit, Chang ejected and parachuted down to a farm. He was captured and held in a guesthouse of the PLA Air Force in Beijing, guarded by four soldiers. Meanwhile, in Taiwan he was presumed killed in action and the Central Daily News reported his \\"death\\" on 12 January. The ROC Air Force built graves at the Bitan Air Force Martyrs' Cemetery () for Chang Liyi and Yeh Changti, another captured Black Cat pilot who was presumed dead. In April 1965, four U-2 aircraft shot down by China, including the U-2C piloted by Chang, were put on display at the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution in Beijing. Chang was later brought to the museum to see the wreckage of his plane. Chang was released from detention in late 1969, almost five years after his capture. He was later sent to live in his hometown Nanjing, where he reunited with his mother and siblings for the first time in 27 years. He worked as a farmer, a factory worker, and eventually as an engineer at the Nanjing Institute of Aeronautics.  Return to Taiwan  In 1982, the PRC government granted Chang and Yeh Changti permission to return to Taiwan and sent them to Hong Kong. However, Chiang Ching-kuo, then President of the Republic of China, considered them compromised and refused to take them back. Yang Shiju (), a former commander of the Black Cat Squadron, contacted the CIA, which settled the duo in the United States. Neither pilot received a medal from the CIA, but their shoot- down had a major impact on the agency and the US Air Force, which began to prioritize the development of pilotless drones at Area 51. Chang finally was granted permission to return to Taiwan in 1990, after the death of Chiang Ching-kuo. On 12 June 2019, Chang died from a heart attack at Songshan Hospital in Taipei. He was 89.  Personal life  In 1956, Chang Liyi married Chang Chia-chi (), a fellow native of Nanjing, and they had three children. Eight years after he was shot down in 1965 and declared dead in Taiwan, she married an army officer. Still not fully convinced that Liyi was dead, she made an agreement with her second husband that she would reunite with Liyi if he would ever come back. In 1983, she met with Liyi in Hong Kong following his release from China, and expressed her guilt for having remarried while he remained single in China. After he was given permission to return to Taiwan, she divorced her second husband and remarried Liyi in April 1991. She died in August 2003 from kidney disease.

ARM announced an increase of 23% and 35% in integer and floating point performance, respectively. Memory bandwidth increased 15% relative to the A76.  Design  The Cortex-A77 serves as the successor of the Cortex-A76. The Cortex-A77 is a 4-wide decode out-of-order superscalar design with a new 1.5K macro-OP (MOPs) cache. It can fetch 4 instructions and 6 Mops per cycle. And rename and dispatch 6 Mops, and 13 µops per cycle. The out-of-order window size has been increased to 160 entries. The backend is 12 execution ports with a 50% increase over Cortex-A76. It has a pipeline depth of 13 stages and the execution latencies of 10 stages. There are six pipelines in the integer cluster - an increase of two additional integer pipelines from Cortex-A76. One of the changes from Cortex-A76 is the unification of the issue queues. Previously each pipeline had its own issue queue. On Cortex-A77, there is now a single unified issue queue which improves efficiency. Cortex-A77 added a new fourth general math ALU with a typical 1-cycle simple math operations and some 2-cycle more complex operations. In total, there are three simple ALUs that perform arithmetic and logical data processing operations and a fourth port which has support for complex arithmetic (e.g. MAC, DIV). Cortex-A77 also added a second branch ALU, doubling the throughput for branches. There are two ASIMD/FP execution pipelines. This is unchanged from Cortex-A76. What did change is the issue queues. As with the integer cluster, the ASIMD cluster now features a unified issue queue for both pipelines, improving efficiency. As with Cortex-A76, the ASIMD on Cortex-A77 are both 128-bit wide capable of 2 double-precision operations, 4 single-precision, 8 half-precision, or 16 8-bit integer operations. Those pipelines can also execute the cryptographic instructions if the extension is supported (not offered by default and requires an additional license from Arm). Cortex-A77 added a second AES unit in order to improve the throughput of cryptography operations. The core supports unprivileged 32-bit applications, but privileged applications must utilize the 64-bit ARMv8-A ISA. It also supports Load acquire (LDAPR) instructions (ARMv8.3-A), Dot Product instructions (ARMv8.4-A), and PSTATE Speculative Store Bypass Safe (SSBS) bit instructions (ARMv8.5-A). The Cortex-A77 supports ARM's DynamIQ technology, and is expected to be used as high-performance cores in combination with Cortex-A55 power-efficient cores.  Licensing  The Cortex-A77 is available as SIP core to licensees, and its design makes it suitable for integration with other SIP cores (e.g. GPU, display controller, DSP, image processor, etc.) into one die constituting a system on a chip (SoC).  Usage  Derivatives by the name of Kryo 585 and Kryo 560, is used in the Snapdragon 865 and Snapdragon 690. Also used in the Exynos 980 and Exynos 880.

The film stars the Spanish voices of Regina Blandón and Mariana Treviño. The film is Mexico's first take on the popular 'superhero' genre, in style of that of Avengers, combined with traditional Latin elements and legends. It is the first animated feature release of the 2020s. The film was released in theaters in Mexico on January 10, 2020. Plot Years earlier, the former Liga de los 5 break into Tin Marín's to save Chema and Dolores, the leaders' children. Chema and Dolores' mother decides to give in to complete a ritual Tin Marín was conducting; as Chema and Dolores' mother starts screaming, their father and the rest of the team try to stop Tin Marín, collapsing the place in the process. Chema and Dolores' parents die during this event. Chema, who has the ability to emanate capsaicin and turn his surroundings pungent and Dolores, who can turn into a ghost —similarly as how her mother did,— now live with the team's gadgetman Tuerkas; after an inccident in which Dolores uses her powers gets uploaded to the internet, Tin Marín locates their house and kidnaps her. Tuerkas introduces Chema to the remaining Liga de los 5 team members: Catrina, a living skeleton who can manipulate bones and use them under her will; Tetlepanquetzal (or Tetle for short), an Aztec warrior who can turn into any animal he touches; and Tuna, a wrestler whose body can produce spines and cactus sap. Chema, Catrina, and Tetle go search Tuna; as he gets into a feud with his employer, Tuerkas informs the team that Tin Marín is at the Museum of Anthropology getting his hands on a dagger needed for the ritual, while Tin Marín manages to steal it, Tuna reveals he replaced the original dagger with a decoy and kept the original one, albeit it got stolen before. The team head to the Lagunilla market in hopes to find the dagger, unbeknownst to them, Tin Marín tracks them down and retrieves the authentic dagger. Meanwhile, at Tin Marín's hideout, Dolores learns that Tin Marín wants to summon an entity known as Dr. Vampiro who can resurrect his daughter. The next day, Chema and Tuna find Tin Marín's hideout after Chema realizes he was given a flyer about a local fair earlier. After their sneak-in goes awry, Catrina and Tetle arrive in a modified bus and save both of them but the bus gets stuck in the underground. Tin Marín manages to summon Dr. Vampiro but he deceives Tin Marín by not resurrecting his daughter as he had promised, the team escapes from the bus and Chema tries to free Dolores with the help of a redeemed Tin Marín, who sacrifices himself in the process. Dr. Vampiro gives sentinence to various landmarks of Mexico City; such as Tláloc's fountain, the Angel of Independence, the Cabeza de Juárez monument, and the Monument to the Revolution, to cause havoc in the city. Catrina, Tetle, and Tuna successfully stop them as Chema and Dolores join powers to defeat Dr. Vamprio, he is defeated and crushed by the Estela de Luz. The newly formed Liga the los 5 are recognized as saviors of the city. Voice cast *José Ángel Torres as ChemaPressReader.com Debuta Como Superheroina - El Sol de Toluca Author: Adolfo Lopez.

Producer and company president, Fernando de Fuentes, stated that one of the film's goals was for it to push beyond the beliefs of the national limits of the superhero film category. He said that the film has been planned for a prolonged time. \\"What we want is to break the myth that there are only superheroes in other countries and show that you can have your own, very Mexican, everywhere and types,\\" the producer said. \\"It is a project that we have been polishing for a long time to do it.\\" Marvick Núñez, the film's director, has faced the challenge of making the film's superhero effort, similar to the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, due to the fact that the genre has not been implemented in Mexico's film industry. Núñez wanted to introduce a \\"different world\\" based on life in Mexico, but also focus more on the characters' superpowers rather than the stereotypes. “There was a boom with Marvel and for years we have seen what happens with them[...],\\" said the director. \\"The instruction by the executive production was to make these Mexican characters[,] but also have comedy[.] [...T]he fun thing about doing this was that we did it as a team and we were all on the same channel.\\". This is the first feature project Núñez has worked on, and with Ánima Estudios. Prior to the film, he worked traditional animation projects in 1996 before studying at Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas (now Faculty of Arts and Design). He later founded the Terrícola Studio in 2004 where he worked as an art and animation director, as well as taking part in 2D and CG animation. During an interview with Proceso, he explains the goal to make the first superhero film of Mexico and said that \\"[...]we thought about our opportunity to include ourselves in this train, and from there the story and the characters took shape”. Núñez added that, \\"[t]he criterion was: what would the superheroes be like if they really existed here? What would be a Mexican power and give rise to comedy? That's why Chema has the power to enchilar, but he enchila himself, so it seems more than carrying a curse.\\" Regina Blandón, who voices Dolores, has explained the film's focused value of directing its superhero effort beyond Mexico's traditions. “It seems to me that much of the value of the film is precisely in that, that not only do the Avengers exist, but we see our culture reflected in superheroes where one of them has the power to \\"spice\\"[...]someone else. There is a catrina, an Aztec warrior and more. The intention is to rescue our traditions and make a film that goes beyond what we are used to,\\" said Blandón. =Animation= The film uses the 2D tween (\\"flash\\") animation format with computer-generated backgrounds for certain sequences, making it the first original 2D feature production from Ánima Estudios outside of their Leyendas franchise since 2012. =Casting= Regina Blandón, voice of Dolores has expressed during an interview with El Sol de Mexico the complexity of her voice role, saying that \\"[...]it's a challenge, it's too complex[...] This particular project caught my attention for the opportunity to do dubbing.” As a fan of animation, Blandón said that she also faced the challenge of recording her character's lines as she must have a tone similar to a 15-year-old, which her character is aged. “I am almost 30 and I speak like José José,” Blandón said. “[T]he director asked me to do it more and [m]ore [acute]. It was about channeling my \\"chavita\\" voice and I think it was achieved; [i]t was a new experience and a great acting challenge.” =Music= Pablo Borghi has composed music for the film with an orchestral performance in Bratislava, Slovakia. Published on: 13 January 2020. Release The film was released in theaters in Mexico on January 10, 2020. The film opened in 10th on its first weekend, grossing $4.6 million pesos (US$0.2 million).

Pre European History  The local indigenous Australian people, the Cammeraygal occupied the area east of the river for at least 5,800 years. The Wallumettagal people were located west of the river.Fact Sheet 8 – Chatswood West – Willoughby City CouncilFairyland Site Assessment - Tony Butteriss, 2006 The original area was relatively flat and swampy. Vegetated mostly by eucalyptus, acacia, tea tree, bracken, swamp oak and paperbark.Brian A. Scott, \\"The Business of the Lane Cove River\\". , page 151-152  Swan Family and Fairyland  Illegal logging occurred at the Fairyland site as early as 1834. By 1847 at least ten people were listed as living in the area.Fairyland Site Assessment - Tony Butteriss, 2006 In 1895, the state government sold blocks of land beside the river. Robert Joshua Campbell Swan (1864 - 1943) and other family members purchased Portions 385 and 386 of Field of Mars for ₤141.Brian A. Scott, \\"The Business of the Lane Cove River\\". , page 151-152 Around 1900, the natural forest country was cleared for agriculture by the Swan family. Many different crops were grown including strawberries and watermelons. New Zealand flax was grown to tie parcels of fruit. By 1905 the property had acquired a name, \\"The Rest\\". Between 1905 and 1910 the market gardens were phased out. After noticing the success of the Avenue Pleasure Grounds downstream at the Fig Tree Bridge and the Fern Bay Pleasure Grounds at Drummoyne, the Swan family then changed the area for recreation. They planted exotic plant species such as the camphor laurel and date palm. Placing painted fairytale figures on trees, and carved fairy like wooden figures were placed in the grounds, such as Little Bo Peep. There was a slippery-dip in the shape of a sleeping giant, supposedly based on the character \\"Brutus\\" from Popeye. Other features were the wooden pirate boat, tiny tots and the upside-down house. Fairyland soon became popular and successful. Fairyland offered a more enticing prospect than its two rivals, mainly due to a more remote and appealing location.Brian A. Scott, \\"The Business of the Lane Cove River\\". , page 151-152 Access to the ground was mostly by ferry. A wharf was built on the river. Some boats would take up to 70 passengers at a time.National Parks & Wildlife Service of New South Wales - Information sign at Fairyland Two of the craft regularly visiting Fairylands were the Escort and the Twilight. In 1918, when the Upper Lane Cove River Ferry Company closed, Fairyland acquired some of their ferries to be part of Fairyland's operations. Church groups, schools, companies and families used the area for picnics and recreation.Brian A. Scott, \\"The Business of the Lane Cove River\\". , page 151-152 = Equipment & Dance Hall = A kiosk, and much playground equipment was installed, such as a flying fox, swings and a wooden pirate ship.

Scott, \\"The Business of the Lane Cove River\\". , page 151-152 The ride was said to emulate an ocean voyage, built in 1914. From White city, Robert Swan also acquired strength-testing machines and coin- operated machines through which customers could view silent films. Six boat swings came from Putney Park. A dance hall was built around 1930. Also around that time, netting was installed around a small sandy beach on the river for swimming.Brian A. Scott, \\"The Business of the Lane Cove River\\". , page 151-152 Certain dancers were known to take a train to Chatswood, then walk downhill to the eastern side of the river, then call for boats to take them across the river to the dance hall. After the construction of Fullers Bridge, a road was built down from Delhi road. Parking was available for 120 cars. In wet weather, the parking area became soaked, with cars being bogged.Fairyland Site Assessment - Tony Butteriss, 2006National Parks & Wildlife Service of New South Wales - Information sign at Fairyland  Closure  In the mid 20th century, Fairyland lost much of its popular appeal. Particularly with the expanding suburbs of Sydney, the diminishing remoteness, the rise of the motor car and the opening of the Epping Road bridge. After a series of floods in 1967, 1968 and 1969 Fairyland closed.Brian A. Scott, \\"The Business of the Lane Cove River\\". , page 151-152 The area was purchased by the National Parks of New South Wales in the late 1970s. Little evidence of the park exists today, particularly after the severe fires of 1994. The access road off Delhi Road is currently closed, overgrown and barely recognizable. A pair of rusted gate holders and some asphalt are all that remain. After the area was abandoned, invasive weeds have been particularly troublesome. Much work by bush regenerators has continued into the 21st century. Today, the 42 hectare area is home to three Endangered Ecological Communities.

It is the first title to be created by Visco for both the Neo Geo MVS (arcade) and Neo Geo AES (home) platforms, as well as their only officially licensed release for the AES during its commercial life span. Taking place on a futuristic sci-fi setting where an unknown alien race from outer space has steadily increased their invasion activities, players assume control of the Yellow Cherry and Red Fox space fighter crafts in a last-ditch effort for mankind to overthrow the alien forces. Though it was initially launched for the Neo Geo MVS, Andro Dunos was later released for the Neo Geo AES on July 17 of the same year. Andro Dunos was met with mixed reception from both critics and reviewers alike since its initial release on the MVS and later on the AES, who commended various aspects of the title such as the colorful and detailed graphics, sound design, simplistic controls and the ability to choose between multiple weapons, but the gameplay was criticized for being unremarkable and not original.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Andro Dunos is a scrolling shoot 'em up game reminiscent of Hellfire and Whip Rush where players take control of the Neo Type space fighter crafts Yellow Cherry (P1) and Red Fox (P2), which are sent by the defense system of Earth across eight levels that take place on a futuristic sci-fi setting, where an unknown alien race from outer space who have steadily increased their invasion activities against humankind that must be eliminated in order to finish a long lasting war as the main objective.Andro Dunos user's manual (Neo Geo AES, US) In addition to the single-player mode, the game also features a two-player cooperative multiplayer mode. If a memory card is present, the players are allowed to save their progress and resume into the last stage the game saved at. A notable feature of the game is the ability to choose between four different weapon sets at any given time in a linear order by pressing the B button and they can be increased up to multiple times from their original state, while charging the currently selected weapon with the A button allows the ships to unleash a powerful shot against enemies. However, this strategy is a risky proposition for players, as the weapon decreases its power level down to one, weakening the ship's current firepower as a result. If the player's ship is hit by enemy fire, they will be respawned but with the penalty of decreasing the ship's power to one level before being hit. Once all lives are lost, the game is over unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing, which resets the main weapon down to level two and the other three sub-weapons down to the first level as well. But if all eight levels are beaten, the player is rewarded a replay and the game repeats.  Development and release  Andro Dunos was initially launched for the arcades by SNK on June 15, 1992, becoming the first title developed by Visco Corporation to be released on the Neo Geo MVS hardware. The game was also released for the Neo Geo AES on July 17 during the same year, which also became the only officially licensed title by Visco to be released for the AES during its commercial run across multiple regions. Although it was never originally ported to the Neo Geo CD, an officially endorsed conversion of the game by independent developer and publisher Neo Conception International (N.C.I.) was released for the console in 2012, which was part of an acquisition deal with Visco in regards to the rights of their intellectual properties.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Andro Dunos on their September 1, 1992 issue as being the twentieth most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as Raiden. The game received mixed reception from both critics and reviewers since its initial release in arcades and Neo Geo AES.

The New IFB began with Steven Anderson of Faithful Word Baptist Church in response to perceived liberalism in other independent Baptist churches. The New IFB does not consider itself to be a denomination, but it requires affiliated churches to follow a set of core doctrines. The New IFB lists 30 affiliated congregations on its website, including congregations in 16 U.S. states, Australia, Canada, the Philippines and South Africa. New IFB churches have caused controversy on several occasions, because of their extreme opposition to homosexuality.  History  The New IFB was formed by Anderson and other Baptist pastors in 2017 in an attempt to revive what older independent Baptist churches once represented. A split in the New IFB occurred in January 2019, after Donnie Romero, pastor at Stedfast Baptist Church-Fort Worth (SBC), resigned after it was revealed he had hired prostitutes, smoked marijuana and gambled. Adam Fannin, the lead preacher at SBC's Jacksonville satellite campus, refused to acknowledge the authority of Jonathan Shelley, another Texas New IFB pastor who took over SBC–Fort Worth following Romero's resignation. Anderson, Fannin and Shelley traded accusations of financial wrongdoing and running a cult. Fannin was later ejected as the lead preacher of SBC-Jax. = Size = The New IFB currently lists 30 affiliated congregations on their website. 22 of the congregations are in 16 U.S. states, two are in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Ontario, three are in the Philippines, two are in the Australian states of New South Wales and Queensland, and one congregation is located in the South African town of Middelburg.  Beliefs  The New IFB website states that it is not a denomination and it also states that New IFB pastors have differing views over minor theological issues. However, the churches are united in following a number of doctrines. The New IFB's website lists its core doctrines as salvation by faith alone, once saved always saved, King James Bible-only, the Trinity, soul-winning, \\"hard\\" preaching, prewrath and post-tribulation rapture and opposition to Calvinism, dispensationalism, worldliness, liberalism, and Zionism. Despite the website's claims that each church is independent, some followers and former followers of the New IFB have accused Anderson of having complete control over the organization and ejecting anyone who has a minor disagreement with him.  Controversy  New IFB pastors have been the subjects of controversy on numerous occasions. The New IFB is strongly opposed to homosexuality, with several pastors advocating the belief that homosexuals should be executed. Anderson and other New IFB pastors have praised the Orlando gay nightclub shooting. On the weekend of the third anniversary of the shooting, the New IFB held a \\"Make America Straight Again\\" conference at an Orlando-area New IFB church. Also in June 2019, Grayson Fritts, pastor at New IFB-affiliated All Scripture Baptist Church and a former detective for the Knox County, Tennessee, Sheriff's Office, delivered a sermon calling for the execution of gays. Some have compared Anderson and the NIFB to the Westboro Baptist Church because of their identical views against homosexuality. The New IFB considers the modern nation of Israel to be a fraud and it also teaches that Christians rather than Jews are God's chosen people. Anderson has also produced videos in which he attacks the religion of Judaism and questions the official account of the Holocaust. The New IFB, like older independent Baptist churches, has been accused of being cult-like. Auckland, New Zealand, New IFB pastor Logan Robertson was deported from Australia in July 2018 after being accused of harassing Muslims at two Brisbane mosques. Robertson had previously attracted media attention after he stated that gay people should be shot and New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern should \\"go home and get in the kitchen\\".

It belongs to the genre science fiction and has been translated into German, French and other languages.  Synopsis  The boy Icaro can fly since he was born. He was taken away from his mother and grew up in the care of the government, which tried to research his abilities. Icaro falls in love with one of the researchers and discovers his own free will. He tries to escape his prison before they are able to take away his urge for freedom from him.  Development and release  The series is based on Moebius's scenario and was drawn by Jirō Taniguchi. According to Moebius's first draft, the manga should have a total of 10,000 pages. Taniguchi, however, was given a free hand in the realization and shortened the plot to almost 300 pages. The series was published in 1997 in Morning magazine by Kodansha in Japan. It was also published by Bijutsu Shuppansha in an anthology in 2000. A translation into French, as well as Italian and Polish, was published by Kana. An English version was published by Simon & Schuster. The German translation of the manga was published in 2016 by Schreiber & Leser in a single volume.  Reception  Peter Osteried described the work as a great collaboration between the two well-known artists. Besides the European influences in Taniguchi's style, influences from Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira can be seen, who in turn was influenced by Moebius. All in all, the work is a \\"perfect synthesis of French- Belgian and Japanese comics\\". Lars von Törne underlines in the Tagesspiegel that the work shows how important western comics were for Taniguchi's style.

She was associated with Roman Ingarden and known for her work in phenomenology and the philosophy of mathematics. Mathematics educator Gierulanka was born in Kraków on June 30, 1909; her father was a civil servant. She studied mathematics at the Jagiellonian University from 1927 to 1932, completing a master's degree with a thesis on Periodic solutions of differential equations, and stayed there for another year for a teaching credential. From 1933 to 1938 she worked as a high school teacher of mathematics, science, and philosophy at two Kraków gymnasia. Psychologist Gierulanka returned to the Jagiellonian University in 1938, as a psychology student working in the Laboratory of Experimental Psychology with Władysław Heinrich. Her studies were interrupted by World War II, during which she and her brother, physicist Jerzy Gierula, taught in secret. She completed her doctorate in 1947. Her dissertation, O przyswajaniu sobie pojęć geometrycznych [On Grasping Geometrical Notions], was published as a book in 1958. Gierulanka remained at the Jagiellonian University, and in 1953 became an adjunct in mathematical analysis at the university, with the plan of writing a habilitation thesis combining mathematical analysis with psychology. However, this did not materialize and in 1957 she returned to the Laboratory of Experimental Psychology. Philosopher In 1958 Gierulanka moved again, becoming an adjunct in philosophy. She became interested in Roman Ingarden's work in phenomenology, and wrote a habilitation thesis in 1962 on the phenomenology of mathematics, Zagadnienie swoistoici poznania matematycznego [On the Peculiarity of Mathematical Cognition], also published at the same time as a book. Failing to obtain a permanent position in philosophy, she returned to a posting in psychology at Jagiellonian, from which she retired in 1971. She died on April 29, 1995, in Kraków. After her habilitation work, Gierulanka became one of the editors of Ingarden's collected works. She also translated works of Ingarden, Edmund Husserl, and Edith Stein into Polish.

shrub with clusters of deep mauve to purple flowers. Description Olearia magniflora is sprawling upright shrub to high with upright stems and an open habit. The branches are smooth and more or less woody. The sessile leaves are dark green above and paler underneath, smooth, slightly sticky and sparsely arranged alternately along the stem. The leaves vary from wedge-shaped or broader at the apex narrowing at the base, long and wide with a prominent mid- vein, usually 3-5 toothed edges at the apex and rolled margins. The single cluster of 14-20 flowers appear at the end of branches on a short stem less than long. The mauve to purple \\"petals\\" (strictly ligules of the ray florets) are linear and long. The flower centre is a yellow disk of 30-56 florets. The oval to linear overlapping bracts are arranged in rows of 4-5 and long, smooth and finely fringed. The dry fruit are one-seeded, smooth, compressed needle- shaped, long and with fine longitudinal lines. The seed is dispersed at maturity. Flowers from July to January. Taxonomy and naming The splendid daisy-bush was first described in 1865 by Ferdinand von Mueller who called it Aster magniflora and published the description in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. In 1867 George Bentham changed the name to Olearia magniflora and published the change in Flora Australiensis. Distribution and habitat The splendid daisy-bush grows in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia. In New South Wales it is found mainly growing from Balranald and Wentworth areas and north to Wilcannia. It grows in heath, woodland and mallee in well-drained, sandy loam soils.
