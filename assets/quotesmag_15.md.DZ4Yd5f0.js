It is the result of many decades of work, from 1923 to 1994, and a successor to the previous 8-volume catalogue compiled by the numismatist Henry Cohen in the 19th Century. It is the standard work for numismatic identification of coinage struck by authorisation of the Roman emperors.  Production  The production of a chronological catalogue of Roman Imperial coinage was started in 1923 by Harold Mattingly, a numismatist at the British Museum, assisted by Edward Allen Sydenham. Their catalogue differed from its predecessor, produced by Henry Cohen in the 19th Century. Although Cohen had classified the coins by emperor, and then alphabetically by the legend (text) on them. Mattingly broke down the classification further into which foundry, and in which series, each coin came from. Mattingly and Sydenham were joined by C. H. V. Sutherland in producing volumes IVb (1938) and IVc (1949), and by Percy H. Webb for volumes Va (1927) and Vb (1933). After 1930, the editorship of each of the final volumes was given to a specialist of the period. After Mattingly's death in 1964, Sutherland and R. A. G. Carson jointly took over editorship of the work. In 1984, Sutherland published an expanded edition of the first volume of 1923, which was not as detailed as those that followed.  Contents  The RIC comprises 13 volumes: * volume 1 : Augustus-Vitellius (31 BC-69 AD), by H. Mattingly and E. A. Sydenham, London, 1923 (revised by C. H. V. Sutherland and R. A. G. Carson, 1984) * volume 2 : Vespasian-Hadrian (69-138), by Harold Mattingly, Edward Allen Sydenham, London, 1926 * volume 3 : Antoninus Pius-Commodus (138-192), by H. Mattingly, E.A. Sydenham, London, 1930 * volume 4a : Pertinax-Geta VII and Caracalla (193-217), by H. Mattingly, E. A. Sydenham, London, 1936 * volume 4b : Macrinus-Pupienus (217-238), by H. Mattingly, E.A.

Planning permission was granted by the South Gloucestershire Council in 2008 to build 2,200 homes for 6,000 residents. Charlton Hayes was named after the village of Charlton, which was demolished to make way for Filton Airfield extension.  Development  Charlton Hayes includes 2, 3 and 4 bedroom homes, a car dealership and a new by-pass 'Hayes Way'. Hayes Way links A38 to Merlin Road and Highwood Road at the bottom of The Mall, Cribbs Causeway. The by-pass was designed to relieve congestion on Highwood Road, which is now restricted to buses. The development was funded by Bovis Homes who made a contribution to the Hayes Way construction. Construction  Highwood Road controversially closed in October 2012 for a trial period. LED Road signs and threats of police enforcement to remove unauthorized traffic began in 2013. The Royal Mail used the roads from Hayes way to relieve traffic off the Patchway Flyover and Haynes Way will link directly to Gypsy Patch Lane. The old Benson Brothers Sites is converting into a police station for Avon and Somerset Police. It is expected after the full decommissioning of the airfield that more homes will be added to the area. The Vauxhall Dealer at the flyover bought a row of old houses and converted the area into a car park.  Businesses A Ford dealership operates there. Other construction companies and housing associations are building houses. The confirmed airfield closure could provide new routes linking the old road to Henbury and Southmead. Roads The main Hayes Way Dual Carriageway is separated into three roundabouts, named after the aeroplanes Concorde, Brabazon, Blenheim.

Personal life  Maund was born in Laverstock, Wiltshire, the son of William Herbert Maund and Lucy Maund.England & Wales, Christening Index, 1530-1980 He served in the Royal Marine Artillery, reaching the rank of lieutenant. In July 1867, he married Mary Emily Baring, daughter of longtime Member of Parliament and Lord of the Treasury Major Henry Bingham Baring. She had been divorced in 1864 from Sir Richard Lewis Mostyn Williams-Bulkeley, 11th Baronet, with whom she had a son. Bulkeley had divorced her for adultery allegedly committed with Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Armitage of the Coldstream Guards. Mary Emily Maund died on 18 February 1887. Maund subsequently married Zoe Gertraud Dudgeon.Sources: K.K. Bezirksgericht Bezau, Abt.I 26 February 1904; purchase agreement dated 17 November 1931. Cited in Maund was known for his quick temper.  Mountaineer  Les Droites (far right), the Aiguille du Dru (far left) and the Aiguille Verte (center) John Oakley Maund was a mountaineer during the period known as the silver age of alpinism in the second half of the 19th century, and a prominent member of the Alpine Club. He weighed at the height of his mountaineering career. From 3 to 5 August 1874 Maund made the third attempt to ascend the main summit of the Meije (Massif des Ecrins in the Dauphin√© Alps) via the north ridge with guides Jean Martin and Johann Jaun. The party had to halt the next day due to bad weather; however, the climb was shown to be perfectly feasible. The Mittellegi Ridge (centre, dividing light and shade) leading to the summit of the Eiger In 1876 Maund made three first ascents in eight days in the Mont Blanc massif. On 31 July 1876 he ascended the Cordier Couloir on the north face of the -high Aiguille Verte with Thomas Middlemore, Henri Cordier and guides Jakob Anderegg, Andreas Maurer and Johann Jaun. This book incorrectly gives the year of the Aiguille Verte climb as 1875. The route was not repeated until 1924, and according to Helmut Dumler is \\"one of the most respected achievements in the history of mountaineering, for the 900m couloir is set at an angle of up to 56¬∞\\". Claire Engel notes that the party were all nearly obliterated by rockfall while they were crossing the bergschrund. The following week, on 4 August 1876, he ascended the Cordier route on the north face of Les Courtes, again with Thomas Middlemore, Henri Cordier and guides Jakob Anderegg, Andreas Maurer and Johann Jaun, followed by the 7 August 1876 first ascent of the east summit of Les Droites (the lowest of the Alpine 4000ers) with Thomas Middlemore, Henri Cordier and guides Johann Jaun and Andreas Maurer. This ascent was not without incident. In an article in the Alpine Journal Maund wrote: In 1881, on 31 July, he attempted the Mittellegigrat (north-east ridge) of the Eiger, with J. Baumann, Johann Jaun, Andreas Maurer and Emile Rey. This party reached the big step on the ridge, which is now surmounted with the aid of a fixed rope. The ridge was finally ascended in 1925 by Maki Y≈´k≈ç, Fritz Amatter, Fritz Steuri and Samuel Brawand.  Entrepreneur  Several sources indicate that Maund played an entrepreneurial role in the turbulent period of the British development of the southern part of Africa in the area that later became Rhodesia (Zimbabwe): In June 1889, about five months before the founding of the British South Africa Company, the \\"Exploring Company Limited\\" was registered in London, holding a quarter of the shares of the Rudd-Rhodes Concession. Maund sat on the Board of Directors, with Alfred Beit, Cecil Rhodes, George Cawston and Lord Gifford. The main goal was \\"the development of the Bechuanaland Protectorate and the countries lying to the North\\". In December 1896 the second general meeting of the British West Chartered Company was chaired by Maund. The press transcript shows that the company was working for the development of the mining industry in South Africa and for the rapid northwards extension of the Bechuanaland railway.  Hunter  Maund was a member of English high society and enjoyed going hunting in the Bregenz Forest in Au, Vorarlberg, Austria. In 1888 he leased the hunting cooperative of Au, and finally the entire hunt to the rear of the Bregenz Forest with the forest areas of Schoppernau, Hopfreben and Schr√∂cken by the village of Baad in Kleinwalsertal. Villa Maund from the west, before the Heiterberg In the 1890s he bought a secluded site in the municipality of Schoppernau, Hopfreben in the foothills of the Alps, where he built a hunting villa in the English country style, which is known to this day as Villa Maund. The architect was William Morris, the English painter, poet, artisan, engineer and printer, who had built two similar-looking houses for Maund in 1888 in the Anglo-Scottish cottage style in Weggis on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland. After the completion of the building in 1892, the first hunting party used the villa in 1895.

He also played basketball for the school, averaging over 13 points a game in 2007. He made a highlight reel play his senior season, running away from the basket while falling out of bounds, shooting it one handed from approximately 35 feet and making the three point basket. Playing football for the high school, he was one of the top receivers in Colorado, as he caught 97 passes for 1,918 yards (averaging 20 yards a catch) and 16 touchdowns as a sophomore and junior. Kaufman earned honorable mention All-State honors in football as a junior and twice was selected to the All-Continental League team.

Describing his mentality on the field, Kaufman said: > You have to think you‚Äôre better than the other person, and trust what you‚Äôre > doing all week and all year, studying film and what you‚Äôre working on in > practice. If you do it right, you‚Äôve beaten your guy already all through the > week. =Records and awards= In his college career, he caught 221 passes (3rd in EWU history; 7th in Big Sky history) for 3,731 yards (2nd all-time at EWU, 4th in the Big Sky; 16.9 per catch) and 33 touchdowns (2nd in school history) as he started 37 games.

NFL career=2013 NFL draft= On January 9, 2013, local TV station KREM announced that Kaufman would forgo his final season of eligibility at Eastern Washington, and declared for the 2013 NFL Draft. He was 20 credits short of a degree and continued his studies online. At an NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis in February 2013, he was tested and underwent multiple physicals.

Sports projected that he might be taken by the New York Giants in the 7th round, saying he \\"has great size and will catch the football going across the middle\\". Kaufman went undrafted in the 2013 NFL Draft but soon signed with the Buffalo Bills as a free agent on April 29, 2013. =2013 NFL season= Kaufman went a perfect six for six, catching all balls thrown to him in the preseason, including one touchdown. (One catch was called back for offensive line holding). His biggest highlight came on his first official catch, against the Colts in game one. The Colts‚Äô sideline read the play before the snap and called in from the sideline to their cornerback that Kaufman was going to run a double-move go route. Despite the advance warning allowing the defender to be in perfect position, Kaufman was still able to pull down the circus catch and get both feet in-bounds. Kaufman consistently was able to get open throughout the preseason, despite very few throws being made overall in the last game in which he saw the most field-time. The Bills released Kaufman on August 30, 2013. The Bills signed Kaufman to their practice squad on December 10, 2013. AFL career Kaufman was recruited and signed by the Gold Coast Suns in 2016 to play for their reserves team in the North East Australian Football League.

While women have traditionally been considered companions to their husbands in the migratory process, most adult migrant women today are employed in their own right. In 2017, of the 168 million migrant workers, over 68 million were women. The increase in proportion of women migrant workers since the early twentieth century is often referred to as the \\"feminization of migration\\". Most women workers immigrate from developing countries to high-income countries, with significant impacts on both their countries of origin and destination countries. Women migrant workers send upwards of $300 billion in remittances to their countries of origin each year, often using this money to pay for their families‚Äô basic health, housing and education needs. On a macroeconomic level, remittances from emigrant workers can account for up to 25% of national gross domestic product, and help these developing countries cope with trade deficits and external debts. However, women migrant workers have to leave their countries of origin to provide financially, and are often separated from their own families. This has led to an uneven distribution of reproductive labor globally: in destination countries, immigrant women help address the care worker shortage, and enable more local women to enter the workforce. On the other hand, in countries of origin, the emigration of large numbers of women forces other members of the community to shoulder greater domestic work burdens. Women migrant workers typically pursue gendered professions such as domestic work and disproportionately work in private homes. As a result, they are comparatively ‚Äúhidden‚Äù from society and are more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. A variety of governmental policies, moreover, have also increased the vulnerability of these women migrant workers to abuse. For example, in the Arab states, migrant domestic workers depend on their employers for legal status, causing the workers to tolerate a significant amount of abuse for fear of deportation. Several countries also prohibit women migrant workers from having sex or becoming pregnant. Statistics Of the 271 million international migrants today, 130 million ‚Äì or nearly half ‚Äì are women. The share of women migrants increased from 46.7% in 1960 to 48.4% in 2010,Morrison, Schiff & Sj√∂blom (2008): The International Migration of Women. Washington: The World Bank. Page 2; Migration and Remittances Factbook 2011. but has declined slightly over the past two decades, from 49.1% in 2000 to 47.9% in 2019. Amongst migrant workers, men also outnumber their women counterparts. According to the International Labor Organization, only 68.1 million ‚Äì or 41.6% ‚Äì of the 164 million migrant workers in 2017 were women. Although migration between developing countries is generally more substantial than migration from developing to high-income countries, the World Bank estimates that there are almost 73 million migrants from developing countries living in high-income OECD countries.these numbers include both refugees and migrant workers. Migration and Remittances Factbook 2011. Women outnumber men amongst immigrants in developed countries, accounting for 50.9% of all immigrants in developed countries. However, in developing countries, women only account for 45.7% of all immigrants, compared to 54.3% for men.  Women migrant workers by region = Arab states = 5.3% of all women migrant workers reside in the Arab states. Even though 40.8% of all workers in the Arab states are migrant workers, only 20% of these migrant workers are women. Cultural and legal institutions in the region, such as the Kefala system and a lack of labor laws, have caused large proportions of these women migrant workers to be exploited and abused. The labor laws in most Gulf states do not cover women migrant domestic workers. As a result, these women migrant workers face harsh working conditions and are vulnerable to abuse. An International Labor Organization study of four Arab countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates) found that women migrant domestic workers worked an average of 101 to 108 hours per week. Many of the women interviewed also complained of sleep deprivation as they were ‚Äúon-call‚Äù all day and night. The majority of women migrant domestic workers in Kuwait were subject to physical, sexual or verbal abuse. Women migrant workers in Lebanon also reported being locked in their employers‚Äô homes and having their food intake restricted. Many Arab states also use the Kefala system, where each woman migrant worker has to be sponsored by a resident. Women migrant workers pay large amounts of money to agencies that help them find sponsors, which is deducted from theirs first salaries. As a result, they receive no income for their first three months‚Äô work and depend entirely on their employers for their basic needs. In addition, as a woman migrant worker's legal status is tied to her employer's sponsorship, she often tolerates significant amounts of abuse for fear of deportation. = Europe and North America = Women international migrants outnumber male migrants in both Europe and North America. 39.8% and 25.8% of women migrant workers reside in Europe and North America respectively, compared to only 26.3% and 21.1% of male migrants. The total number of immigrants has also continually increased in both regions due to an increased demand for care work amongst dual income families.Beneria, Lourdes (2008). \\"The crisis of care, international migration, and public policy\\". Feminist Economics. 14(3): 1‚Äì21. doi:10.1080/13545700802081984 (https://doi.org/10.1080%2F13545700802081984). For example, Beneria, a feminist economist, argues that the demand for care work in Europe in the 1990s and 2000s brought young Latinas to countries like Spain, in order to provide care work for the aging population. =China= The number of rural migrant workers in China increased eightfold from 20-30 million in the mid-1980s to upwards of 160 million in 2012. Of these 160 million workers, 33-50% are women. Gaetano, an American cultural anthropologist, argues that rural women's motivations to migrate are numerous and complex. Some women are driven by the allure of modern cities, and others by filial responsibility. Studies show that poor Chinese workers are more likely to migrate, and that migration increases per capita household income by 8.5 to 13.1%. Rural migrants remit a large proportion of their incomes to their families. In order to find employment in China's bigger cities, such as Shanghai, rural migrant women rely on guanxi, social networks that enable them to connect with family or other villagers who have already left for the city. Rural migrant women pursue a wide variety of jobs, from domestic to factory work, owning their own businesses to working as hostesses in China's popular karaoke bars. A woman from one of China's rural areas Women working in a silk factory in China Many young Chinese women from rural areas are sent to work at factories in China's cities, where they face poor working conditions, strict regulations, low wages, and non-payments of their salaries. As Chinese laws mandate that factories must provide their women migrant workers with food and shelter, these women workers become entirely dependent on their employers for their basic needs. Employers are able to control almost every aspect of their workers‚Äô lives, and can therefore force their employees to work late or penalize them for poor performance. In addition, Ngai, a sociologist, argues that the dormitory system is stressful for these migrant women as it removes them from their families. While this system has provided China with cheap labor to compete globally in manufacturing, it has come at the expense of isolation, maltreatment, long work hours and low wages for the women migrant workers who work in these factories. The documentary China Blue provides insight into the treatment of these young Chinese women and the conditions under which they live. =Southeast Asia= Filipina migrant workers in Hong Kong Women migrant workers play an important role in economic development in Southeast Asia. For decades, countries in the region have either sent or received large numbers of women migrant workers. Demand for contract labor in the Arab states as well as other Southeast and East Asian countries has led to significant emigration amongst women workers in the Philippines, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand. By the 1990s, the Philippines had become the world‚Äôs largest source of government-sponsored emigrant workers. Upwards of 700,000 migrant workers were emigrating from the Philippines each year, most of whom were women. Today, Filipino migrant workers send over $24 billion in remittances annually, which accounts for 8-10% of the Philippines‚Äô GDP. Large numbers of Southeast Asian emigrant women pursue domestic and care work, a phenomenon that scholars refer to as \\"the global nanny chain\\" or \\"the international division of reproductive labor\\".Lan, Pei-Chia. Global Cinderellas: Migrant Domestics and Newly Rich Employers in Taiwan. Durham, NC: Duke UP, 2006. Print. In fact, in Southeast Asian countries such as the Philippines, over 60% of emigrant workers are women, and over two-thirds of these women pursue domestic work. Similarly, in Indonesia, 70% of all emigrant workers leaving Indonesia for Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and South Korea are women seeking domestic and care work. Some Southeast Asian governments have actively promoted the emigration of women workers, both to reduce unemployment and increase remittances. In Indonesia, for example, the Department of Manpower set up a Center for Overseas Employment, along with training programs for potential emigrant women domestic workers to improve their domestic service skills. Meanwhile, labor shortages have caused other Southeast Asian countries, such as Singapore and Malaysia, to turn to immigrant workers as a cheap source of labor. In Singapore, the increase in women migrant domestic workers parallels an increase in the workforce participation rate of Singaporean women. Between the 1980s and 1990s, the women workforce participation rates amongst women in Singapore increased by 70%. Similarly, the number of women migrant domestic workers also increased significantly, and by 1999, Singapore had over 100,000 immigrant women domestic workers in a small city-state with just under 4 million residents. Millions of Burmese women migrate to Thailand each year, where they work almost exclusively in agriculture and manufacturing.Pearson, Ruth; Kusakabe, Kyoko. Thailand's Hidden Workforce : Burmese Migrant Women Factory Workers. London: Zed Books, 2012. The Thai manufacturing and agricultural sectors are dependent on Burmese migrants ‚Äì more than half of whom are women ‚Äì due to the migrants' low pay and long working hours. As these Burmese migrant workers are typically undocumented, they receive limited protection under Thai law. In fact, they often face aggression from the Thai government and police force. = Latin America and the Caribbean = As of 2019, women made up 49.9% ‚Äì or nearly half ‚Äì of all international migrants in Latin America and the Caribbean. In addition, the proportion of women migrant workers has increased between 2000 and 2019. = Africa = There has been an increase in women migrants within Africa. Due to the high rates of poverty and male unemployment in the continent, many women have had to seek employment or even become the main providers for their families. Women workers often migrate within the region to work in the agricultural and mining sectors, as well as to North America and Europe, where there is a high demand for care workers. Types of employment Young migrant woman worker weeding sugar beets at Fort Collins, United States in 1972 Women migrant workers tend to be concentrated in a narrow range of highly gendered professions, including both unregulated industries such as agriculture, domestic and care work, and the sex industry, as well as highly skilled professions such as nursing. =Domestic and care work= Domestic and care work is a highly gendered profession that is dominated by women. In Europe, both the aging population and welfare cuts have led to an increasing demand for migrant domestic workers. In other countries like Singapore, increased women workforce participation rates have driven the demand for migrant domestic workers. As a result of this demand, domestic and care work is now the most common profession pursued by women migrant workers. Paid domestic and care work by migrant women is often undervalued the same way unpaid reproductive labor has always been. Some countries also use the concept of ‚Äúfamily membership‚Äù to justify denying migrant domestic workers the same protections other migrant workers enjoy. For example, when deciding whether a Romanian migrant domestic worker should be given overtime pay, the Israeli courts asked, ‚Äúwould a mother demand overtime for attending to her children at night?‚Äù Similarly, in the UK, laws governing work hour limits, rights to breaks, and night work limits specifically exclude domestic workers. In addition, migrant domestic workers are often forced to live-in with their employers, where they are ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù to the public and especially vulnerable to abuse. Widespread sexual, psychological and physical abuse has been reported amongst migrant domestic workers in a range of countries, including Hong Kong, many of the Arab states, and Italy. However, migrant domestic worker laws have been changing in some countries. For example, domestic workers who immigrated to Canada via the Live-in Caregiver program prior to 2014 were required to live with their employers, but the new Home Child Care Provider Pilot no longer has such a requirement. Women migrant domestic workers are rarely able to immigrate with their families. As a result, they often \\"transplant\\" their love for their own children onto the children they care for, forming close bonds with their charges.  Impacts on countries of origin = Economic impacts = Studies conducted in the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Malaysia have shown that migrant women seek employment abroad primarily to help pay for their families‚Äô basic expenses and healthcare needs. As of 2015, migrant workers remitted over $601 billion to their countries of origin. Developing countries received over $441 billion of that total, three time as much as the developmental assistance and almost as much as the foreign direct investment they received. In developing countries like Nepal, foreign remittances account for almost 25% of GDP. In addition, many migrant workers send remittances through informal channels, so the actual total is even higher. While studies in Mexico and the Philippines have shown that men remit more and a larger proportion of their incomes than do women, other studies in Bangkok, Laos and rural Philippines have found that women remit a larger proportion of their income. Data from the World Bank suggests that even though women migrant workers typically earn less than their male counterparts, their contributions account for half of the $601 billion in formal remittances sent in 2015. Remittances from women migrant workers are more likely to be used for ‚Äúhealth, education, family and community development‚Äù, while men's remittances tend to be used for investments. In developing countries such as Nepal, the majority of remittances made by women migrant workers go towards poverty reduction at the household level. A study of Nepalese women migrant workers showed that 45% of used their remittances exclusively to provide basic needs such as food and healthcare, and schooling for their children. On a macroeconomic level, remittances can also help countries of origin cope with trade deficits, reduce pressure on local currency, and reduce external debt. However, other studies have questioned the existence of a ‚Äúmigration- development‚Äù nexus for women migrant workers. While remittances have spurred development in some countries, in other communities, they have adversely affected growth. = Impacts of maternal migration = The emigration of women migrant workers has led to an unequal international division of reproductive labor. As women migrant workers leave their countries of origin to pursue domestic work in other countries, they often leave behind a deficit in domestic labor in their countries of origin that female relatives or less privileged local women will have to take on. The emigration of mothers in particular can profoundly impact the social and emotional well-being of their children. A study of children in Sri Lanka with mothers working abroad showed that these children suffered from mental health conditions at higher rates than the control group. Despite migrant mothers‚Äô efforts to remain in touch with their children, their interactions are often irregular and ‚Äúfall short of meaningful exchange‚Äù. As a result, these children often grow up without getting to know their parents. The children's educations are also affected by the lack of supervision and parental support. =Impacts on gender roles= Some women migrate in order to escape oppressive gender norms, leaving their home and obtaining increased economic independence and freedom. This can strengthen a woman's position in the family by improving her relative bargaining position. Women workers have greater leverage in the household because they have control over a degree of economic assets. Liu, a sociologist who studies gender, sexuality, family and work in China, argues that social roles follow migrant workers in their new environments. There is a strong connection between a woman's role in her rural life to her new life in an urban city or foreign country. Women accept the treatment they receive because it is normalized by their traditional and domestic roles, e.g. their roles at home as homemaker and houseworker. On the other hand, Beneria, a Spanish- American economist, contends that gender roles evolve as women from Latin America leave their families and move to pursue domestic care work in Western Europe. She concedes that most migrant workers work in highly gendered professions such as domestic and care work, where their traditional gender roles are reinforced. However, she also argues that a woman's choice to leave and provide remittances for her family initiates a reversal in gender roles within her family. The emigration of women also forces men who are left at home to adapt to changing gender norms. For example, it has become more common for women from Sri Lanka to immigrate to the Middle East to pursue domestic work. This emigration forces men who remain in the villages of Sri Lanka to adopt new gender norms that may be contrary to traditional gender ideals. Some of these men cope by drinking alcohol, which is seen as a masculine activity.Gamburd, Michele. \\"Breadwinner No More.\\" Global Women: Nannies, Maids, and Sex Workers in the New Economy. New York City: Metropolitan /Henry Holt and, 2002. 190-206. Print. Other men find work of their own, both in, and outside of, their communities. Even though these men often earn less than their migrant wives, they do not fully renounce their traditional roles as the breadwinners of their families, and are thus able to maintain some of their masculinity. The few men who choose to shoulder the domestic burden that women typically do are often looked down upon for being \\"too feminine\\". As they are no longer the breadwinners of their families, they are considered by some in their community to no longer be \\"men\\".  Impacts on destination countries  Globalization facilitates the transfer of reproductive labor from privileged women in high-income countries to women migrant domestic workers from developing countries. This delegation of household work enables more women from developed countries to pursue their careers in the same way men do. In Singapore, the large influx of foreign maids between 1980 and 1994 paralleled a 70% increase in the workforce participation rate of married Singapore women. Hui argues that this increase would not have been possible without the immigration of women domestic workers. In many developed countries, such as the United States, aging populations have led to a greater demand for long- term care workers. As a result, these developed countries are increasingly turning to women migrant workers to meet their elder care needs. In the United States, 75% of in-home eldercare providers in Los Angeles and 95% of care home operators in Hawaii are Filipina migrant workers. Browne et al. argue that the United States‚Äô reliance on women migrant workers in the long-term care sector has legitimized the low pay of workers in this industry and devalued the eldercare profession as a whole.  Impacts on women migrant workers =Exploitation and abuse= Women migrant workers are primarily employed in informal sectors, and are often either not covered or only partially covered by the labor legislation, social security, and welfare provisions of their host countries. Exploitation of women migrant workers is less identifiable than that of male migrant workers because the exploitation of women often occurs in situations with weak labor inspection services. Women migrant domestic workers in particular are often isolated, and can become dependent upon their employers. Examples of maltreatment include: not getting paid, restricted movement, removal of personal identity documents, long shifts, working for a whole week without days-off, sexual exploitation, and poor living conditions with inadequate food, water, and accommodation. There have also reportedly been cases of employers confiscating personal belongings (i.e. passports, mobile devices) and locking cupboards and fridges to prevent migrant domestic workers from taking eating breaks In addition, Cheng argues that migrant women workers are isolated even within their own social circles. As a result, they often have poor support systems, which further increases their dependence on their employers' households and places them in a vulnerable position. = Reproductive health = Some Gulf states, such as the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, forbid women migrant workers from engaging in sexual activities. If these women become pregnant during their time in the Gulf, they are imprisoned for a year for the crime of zina. They have to give birth in prison and are forcibly separated from their children when deported.  International responses  The International Labour Organization (ILO) has provided a list of ameliorative measures that should be implemented by governments and organizations in donor, transit, and destination countries in order to improve the experiences of female and male migrant workers alike. Some of these measures include the following: * Implementation of ILO Conventions on Migrant Workers, Nos. 97 and 143; ILO Convention No. 111 on Non-discrimination and Equality; ILO Conventions Nos. 19, 118, 157 and 165 on Social Security. * Guarantee of health care access to migrant workers and accompanying family members. * Protection of migrant worker rights to join trade unions and other migrant associations. * Enforcement of guidelines for ethical recruitment and supervision of private recruitment. * Acknowledgement of migrant worker qualifications obtained in home countries. * Provision of migrant workers with pre-departure information, training on social and labor conditions in destination countries, life insurance, pension plans, medical insurance, and basic language training. UNIFEM (now UN Women) is a branch of the United Nations dedicated to the support and defense of women workers. As the advent of migrant work has become more prevalent among women, UNIFEM has had to help keep their rights protected. This includes establishing a human rights standard, timely payment, rest days, medical care, and housing investigation. UNIFEM has promoted several laws similar to the law on the Protection of Migrant Women in Indonesia. Their goal is to make a universal code of ethics and treatment for all those engaging in migration for work or other reasons. Authors Tonya Basok and Nicola Piper discuss the global governance of international migration efforts undertaken by the non- governmental organizations trying to protect the rights of Latin Americans and those from the Caribbean, moving to Europe. They argue that although the management of trafficking the women to and from their country of origin has improved, the management of labor rights abroad is difficult due to the lack of rights promotions as opposed to management efforts.

Early years Gertrude Rosenthal was born in Mayen, Germany in 1903.‚ÄúThe Early and Late Rosenthal‚Äù The Sun 20 Oct. 1968, SM4 In 1923, she received her baccalaureate, but with the financial strife that beset Germany in the wake of World War I, Rosenthal was unable to advance directly to university. She obtained a job in the bookstore Kolnische Zeiting where she read many volumes about art history which fostered her interest and expertise in the subject until she had the funds to enroll in the University of Cologne. Rosenthal also wrote a column in the newspaper about art, dance, theater, and books. In 1931, Gertrude Rosenthal earned her PhD, writing her dissertation about 17th and 18th century Scotch, Italian, and French painters.Lowell E. Sunderland, ‚ÄúGertrude Rosenthal: At Home in the World of Art‚Äù The Sun 1 Nov. 1965 B1 Although she wanted to study Antoine Watteau in France, her professor did not let her; thus, she went to Rome to study French sculpture of the High Baroque period instead. Eventually, Rosenthal travelled to Avignon and studied at the Sorbonne (building) in Paris. 1930s The rise of Adolf Hitler to power in 1933 impacted the life and career of Gertrude Rosenthal. Due to the Press Law, it became unsafe for her to sign her names to her articles so she had a friend sign them for three months. Worried about putting others in danger, Rosenthal stopped submitting her writing altogether. For the next five years, she devoted most of her time to tending to her sick mother, yet she also served as the co-manager of the Society of Arts and Letters that organized cultural events employing actors, musicians, and scholars who were either Jewish or associated with Jews. Then in 1938, after the death of her mother, Gertrude Rosenthal left Germany for England with three dollars and a permit to work as a domestic servant. She went to the Courtauld Institute of Art of the University of London to ask if her permit could be changed. Although the administration denied her request to change her permit so she could obtain employment at the Institute, the chief librarian, Lady R·∏•oda Welsford overlooked the official verdict and gave Rosenthal the job. Rosenthal later remarked that the incident let her know what it meant to be free and regarded it as the greatest moment of her life. United States In 1940, Gertrude Rosenthal immigrated to the United States and became the art librarian at Goucher College where she built up the slide collection. Rosenthal left Goucher in 1945, the same year she received her American citizenship, to become the Director of Research at the Baltimore Museum of Art (BMA). She then went on to serve as general curator and ultimately senior curator of the museum. Throughout her tenure at the BMA, Rosenthal was known for organizing scholarly exhibitions that had popular appeal such as ‚ÄúThe Age of Elegance: The Rococo and its Effects‚Äù in 1959 and ‚ÄúFrom El Greco to Pollack‚Äù in 1968.John Russell, ‚ÄúGertrude Rosenthal, a Curator, Dies at 85‚Äù New York Times 11 May 1989 She was also instrumental in getting collectors to donate their art to the institution and played a significant role along with the museum director at the time, Adelyn Dohme Breskin, in securing the Cone collection. After her retirement in 1969, Rosenthal continued to retain ties with the BMA until her death in 1989. Honors Gertrude Rosenthal held honorary doctorates from Goucher and the Maryland Institute College of Art and was a senior fellow of the National Endowment for the Arts. She was also a visiting lecturer at Johns Hopkins University. ReferencesExternal References *John Dorsey, ‚ÄúPast Directors Fete Rosenthal‚Äù The Sun 25 May 1983, B5. * ‚ÄúLetter from Saidie A.

Biography  Born on 20 March 1771 in Doberlug, Lower Lusatia. Heun went into the Prussian civil service, and wrote in his spare time. He published under the pseudonym H. Clauren (an anagram of Carl Heun), and became one of the most popular authors of fiction for the middle class in the first half of the nineteenth century. In 1825, Wilhelm Hauff published a parody of Heun's novels, Der Mann im Monde (The Man in the Moon), imitating his style, and published under his pen name H. Clauren. Heun brought a lawsuit against Hauff, and won, leading Hauff to write another book, Kontroverspredigt √ºber H. Clauren und den Mann im Mond (1826), successfully destroying the reputation of Heun's works. Heun's collected works were published in 25 volumes as Gesammelte Schriften in 1851. He died on 2 August 1854 in Berlin.  Influence  One of Heun's short stories, \\"Die graue Stube\\", was translated for the French ghost story anthology Fantasmagoriana (1812). Fantasmagoriana was read by Lord Byron, Mary Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John William Polidori and Claire Clairmont at the Villa Diodati in Cologny, Switzerland during 1816, the Year Without a Summer, and inspired them to write their own ghost stories, including \\"The Vampyre\\" (1819), and Frankenstein (1818), both of which went on to shape the Gothic horror genre. A. J. Day describes how many themes and ideas in Frankenstein are a reflection of Fantasmagoriana, and uses passages from Heun's \\"Die graue Stube\\" to compare to both the novel and Shelley's recollection of her inspiration in the preface to the novel. Another of his short stories, \\"The Robber's Castle\\", may have been one of the sources of inspiration for Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\" (1839).

Amhaouch was descended from a long line of marabouts who were influential religious figures in Morocco from 1715. Amhaouch backed two rebellions against the Moroccan government and later fought against the French occupying forces. He declared a defensive jihad against France during the Zaian War but died of natural causes in 1918, three years before the war ended in the tribesmen's defeat. His son, Sidi El Mekki Amhaouch, continued to fight the French until his defeat in 1932. Amhaouch's descendant is a religious leader in modern-day Morocco.  Early life  Amhaouch was a member of the Imhiwach, a dynasty of marabouts that dominated central Morocco from around 1715 to 1932. The Imhawch were renowned for their \\"Koranic-inspired teaching, magic rites and doomsday prophecies\\". A member of the same family was responsible for the capturing of Sultan Mulay Slimane on May 1819. Ali Amhaouch was born in 1844 and became widely known as a religious figure, of the Darqawa sufi order, who commanded respect across Morocco and was one of the few people capable of bringing peace to warring tribes. He made his own prophecies and considered the Jbel Toujjit mountain, the source of the Moulouya River, to be a sacred site. Amhaouch supported the Ait Sukhman tribe against the rival Zaian Confederation in intermittent warfare lasting from 1877 to 1909. Amhaouch was also a key backer of Si Mhand La√¢rbi, a member of the Alaouite dynasty, against Moroccan government forces in the 1880s. La√¢rbi's men were able to defeat a force commanded by Moulay Srou, the uncle of Sultan Hassan I, in battle in 1888.  Interaction with the French  Amhaouch met with the French explorer Ren√© de Segonzac in 1904-5 and gave him documents detailing the mountains and tribes of Aghbala and also a Tamazight prophecy. The prophecy was written in the 12th century of Islam (approx 1700s) by Amhaouch's great uncle, Bou Beker, and was said to foretell the 1888 victory over Sultan Hassan. Segonzac later described Amhaouch as a strong and influential man, one of the \\"great spiritual leaders of Morocco\\" and the \\"most powerful religious personality of the south east\\". Amhaouch supported another revolt against the Moroccan sultan in 1908, leading troops of the Melwiya to join the uprising led by Moulay Lahssen el Saba√¢ in the east of the country until forced to return home due to Saba√¢'s defeat at the hands of the French troops in Menhaba and Boudenib. Following the declaration of the French protectorate over Morocco after the signing of the Treaty of Fes in 1912 French troops began occupying the inland portion of Morocco. Following the 1914 fall of Khenifra he joined forces with his former enemy, Mouha ou Hammou Zayani (leader of the Zaian Confederation), and tribal leader Moha ou Said to form a \\"powerful Berber trinity\\" that contested the Zaian War against the French. Amhaouch declared a defensive jihad against the French upon the outbreak of the First World War. This extended from the Dad√®s Gorges to the desert beyond the Anti-Atlas mountains and was part of a plan to exploit the withdrawal of French troops from Morocco for the defence of France. Amhaouch's men were engaged and defeated by French columns commanded by Colonels No√´l Garnier-Duplessix and Henri Claudel in late 1914. Amhaouch himself died of natural causes in 1918. Hammou and Said continued to fight the French and, though they lost the Zaian War in 1921, pacification of Morocco was not completed until 1934 - years after their deaths. Amhaouch's eldest son, Sidi Lmekki Amhaouch, who was said to have inherited a magical rifle cartridge from his father, also fought against the French. In August/September 1932 he held out for more than a month with just 1,000 tribesmen against two French columns. Amhaouch's descendant, Sidi Mohand Amhaouch, is a religious leader in modern Morocco.

Problems have ranged from petty skirmishes between the two communities and have led to terrorist attacks, police harassment, extortion, home invasions, physical violence, and massacres perpetrated against the Somali- Kenyan community. Background Throughout much of the 20th century, the Northern Frontier District (NFD) was a part of the Jubaland region in present- day southern Somalia. On 26 June 1960, after granting British Somaliland independence, the British government declared that all Somali-inhabited areas of East Africa should be unified in one administrative region. However, after the dissolution of the former British colonies in the region, Britain granted administration of the Northern Frontier District to Kenyan nationalists despite an informal plebiscite demonstrating the overwhelming desire of the region's population to join the newly formed Somali Republic.David D. Laitin, Politics, Language, and Thought: The Somali Experience, (University Of Chicago Press: 1977), p.75 On the eve of Kenyan independence in August 1963, British officials belatedly realized that the new Kenyan administration was not willing to give up the Somali-inhabited areas it had just been granted administration of. Led by the Northern Province People's Progressive Party (NPPPP), Somalis in the NFD vigorously sought union with their kin in the Somali Republic to the north.Bruce Baker, Escape from Domination in Africa: Political Disengagement & Its Consequences, (Africa World Press: 2003), p.83 In response, the Kenyan government enacted a number of repressive measures designed to frustrate their efforts in what came to be known as the Shifta War.Rhoda E. Howard, Human Rights in Commonwealth Africa, (Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.: 1986), p.95 Although the conflict ended in a cease-fire, Somalis in the region still identify and maintain close ties with their kin in Somalia.Godfrey Mwakikagile, Kenya: identity of a nation, (Godfrey Mwakikagile: 2007), p.79. They have traditionally married within their own community and formed a cohesive ethnic network. Petty skirmishes Between 2010‚Äì2012, Somali herders in the Kitui District in the Eastern Province clashed with the Kenyan Kamba community along the Kitui and Tana River boundary. The conflict was related to pastureland for livestock. Historical massacres=Garissa massacre= The Garissa Massacre was a 1980 massacre of ethnic Somali residents by the Kenyan government in the Garissa District of the North Eastern Province. The incident occurred when government forces, acting on the premise of flushing out a local hoodlum known as Abdi Madobe, set fire to a residential estate called Bulla Kartasi, killing people and raping women. They then forcefully interned the populace in a primary school for three days without food or water, resulting in over 3000 deaths. p.10 Legal Impediments to Development in Northern Kenya, Ahmed Issack =Wagalla Massacre= The Wagalla massacre was a massacre of ethnic Somalis by Kenyan security forces on 10 February 1984 in Wajir District, North Eastern Province. The massacre took place on 10 February 1984 at the Wagalla Airstrip. The facility is situated approximately 15 km (9 mi) west of the district capital of Wajir in the North Eastern Province, a region primarily inhabited by ethnic Somalis. Kenyan troops had descended on the area to reportedly help diffuse clan-related conflict. However, according to eyewitness testimony, about 5,000 Somali men were then taken to an airstrip and prevented from accessing water and food for five days before being executed by Kenyan soldiers.Wagalla massacre: Raila Odinga orders Kenya probe According to the chairman of The Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission of Kenya, a government oversight body that had been formed in response to the 2008 Kenyan post-election violence, the Wagalla massacre represents the worst human rights violation in Kenya's history. =Garissa University College Massacre= On 2 April 2015, gunmen stormed the Garissa University College in Garissa, Kenya, killing 147 people, and injuring 79 or more. The militant group Al-Shabaab from southern Somalia, which the gunmen claimed to be from, took responsibility for the attack. The gunmen took over 700 students hostage, freeing Muslims and killing and raping those who identified as Christians. The siege ended the same day, when all four of the attackers were killed. Five men were later arrested in connection with the attack, and a bounty was placed for the arrest of a suspected organizer. The attack was the deadliest in Kenya since the 1998 United States embassy bombings, and is the second deadliest overall, with more casualties than the 2002 Mombasa attacks, the 2013 Westgate shopping mall attack, the 2014 Nairobi bus bombings, the 2014 Gikomba bombings, the 2014 Mpeketoni attacks and the 2014 Lamu attacks. 2012‚Äì2013 conflict In October 2011, the coordinated Operation Linda Nchi between the Somali military and the Kenyan military began against Al-Shabaab.Joint Communique ‚Äì Operation Linda Nchi The mission was officially led by the Somali Armed Forces, with the Kenyan forces providing a support role. Since the Operation Linda Nchi began, Al-Shabaab vowed retaliation against the Kenyan authorities. At the militant group's urging,Al-Shabaab to retaliate in Kenya with \\"huge blasts\\" a significant and increasing number of terrorist attacks in Kenya have since been carried out by local Kenyans, many of whom are recent converts to Islam.Kenya: A new breed of terrorist is born Estimates in 2012 placed the figure of Kenyan fighters at around 10% of Al-Shabaab's total forces. Referred to as the \\"Kenyan Mujahideen\\" by Al-Shabaab's core members, the converts are typically young and overzealous, poverty making them easier targets for the group's recruitment activities. Because the Kenyan insurgents have a different profile from the Somali and Arab militants that allows them to blend in with the general population of Kenya, they are also often harder to track. Reports suggest that Al-Shabaab is attempting to build an even more multi-ethnic generation of fighters in the larger region. One such recent convert who helped carry out the Kampala bombings but now cooperates with the Kenyan police believes that in doing so, the group is essentially trying to use local Kenyans to do its \\"dirty work\\" for it while its core members escape unscathed. According to diplomats, Muslim areas in coastal Kenya and Tanzania, such as Mombasa and Zanzibar, are also especially vulnerable for recruitment. On 18 November 2012, 10 people were killed and 25 seriously injured when an explosion ripped apart a route 28 mass transit mini-bus (matatu) in Eastleigh. The blast was believed to have been an improvised explosive device or bomb of some sort.http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/6-dead-in-Eastleigh-matatu- explosion/-/539546/1624650/-/14asbjk/-/index.html Looting and destruction of Somali-owned homes and shops by angry mobs of young Kenyans ensued. Somalis defended their property, and interpreted the bus explosion as a pretext for non-Somalis to steal from their community. On 20 November 2012, Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) swooped on Garissa in a military operation. KDF soldiers subsequently burned down the local market and shot at a crowd of protesters, killing a woman and injuring 10 people. Another 35 residents were also receiving treatment at the provincial hospital after being assaulted by the soldiers, including a chief and two pupils. A group of MPs led by Farah Maalim accused Kenyan officers of inciting violence, raping women and shooting at students, and threatened to take the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) if the perpetrators were not brought to justice. Maalim also suggested that the deployment of the soldiers was unconstitutional and had not received the requisite parliamentary approval, and that the ensuing rampage cost Garissa entrepreneurs over Sh1.5 billion to Sh2 billion in missed revenue. Additionally, Sheikhs with the CPK threatened to sue the military commanders for crimes against humanity committed during the operation. However, general harassment of the Somali community by Kenyan policemen continued, with some officers going as far as invading the homes of Somali businesspeople to steal precious jewelry, foreign currencies and electronic devices, including expensive phones, laptops, and other personal accessories. By January 2013, a mass exodus of Somali residents was reported. Hundreds of Somali entrepreneurs withdrew between Sh10 to Sh40 billion from their bank accounts in Kenya, with the intention of reinvesting most of that money back home in Somalia. The collective departures most affected Eastleigh's real estate sector, as landlords struggled to find Kenyans able to afford the high rates of the apartments and shops vacated by the Somalis. The maritime border dispute is a problem that Kenya claims over Somali waters and the solution was held by the ICJ.  Coastal Oil Field Dispute  In February 2019, Kenyan officials have alleged that Somalia is engaged in an inappropriate auctioning of drilling rights along the African coast of the Ocean. The International Court of Arbitration has scheduled procedures for September 2019 concerning maritime territorial waters, which Somali sources indicate is being pre-empted by the Kenyan officials. Kenya demanded Somalia to abandon its ICJ case for bilateral discussion. Somalia sees this as delaying tactics as discussion did not produce results between 2009 and 2014. Kenya gave mining rights to France and Italian companies in 2009, however, accused Somalia of doing the same. Somalia denied the accusation. This seems to create confusion. The only hope is for ICJ to make a binding decision.

The Project was founded in New York City by Michael Feldschuh, a former Wall Street professional and an amateur photographer, and James Austin Murray, a New York City firefighter and 9/11 responder who also ran a gallery in lower Manhattan. The Project was founded in the days following the tragedy, to provide a venue for the display of photographs accompanied by captions by anyone who wished to participate. The exhibit aimed to preserve a record of the spontaneous outdoor shrines that were being swept away by rain or wind or collected by the city for historical preservation.

During this period, Chicago Tribune discussed the possibility of people becoming immune to the impact of disaster photographs of 9/11, but Alan G. Artner, Tribune Art Critic, said \\"the most familiar images brought the events back to this viewer with force, which is one sign of how emotionally close to Sept. 11 we still are.\\"Artner, Alan G. \\"At the Harold Washington Library, more than 5,000 objects try to define September 11\\", \\"Chicago Tribune\\", 29 August 2002. History Several days after the attacks, Feldschuh started soliciting submissions for the Project by handing out flyers in Union Square (New York City) to people who were taking photographs of the aftermath. He collaborated with James Austin Murray and together they started the September 11 Photo Project with approximately 200 photos in a 4000-square-foot gallery space in SoHo. It was meant as a public space where everyone affected could express their own personal narrative and aid a collective healing and reconciliation process. The exhibition was an illustration of the millions of individual stories of that day. The September 11 Photo Project differed from other projects about 9/11 at the time because it was a completely open and public forum where the collective public chose what is displayed. The Washington Post journalist Philip Kennicot wrote \\"the guts of this collection are accidental, often voyeuristic, even discardable images, made with whatever camera happened to be handy at the time, on strips of film that no doubt began with images of the last vacation or someone's birthday party.\\" Kennicott, Philip. \\"A Passing Fancy Leaves an Indelible Impression\\", \\"The Washington Post\\", 2 March 2002.

The September 11 Photo Project was featured in Patricia J. Raskin's book \\"Pathfinding: Seven Principles For Positive Living\\" as an example of a project that fosters human connectedness, compassion, and understanding amongst people. Feldschuh described the effects of kindness on a society, and the hope and positive things that can be taken from the tragedy. \\"It's the value of being connected to others, and the way to do this is to bear witness to what they have gone through. It's the principle of putting yourself in the place of another, of seeing and witnessing where they are. That is fostering human connectedness and understanding and I think that we all have a strong desire and need to be connected to one another. That sounds easy but it's actually incredibly difficult. We have to take the time to read, think, understand, and experience the perspective of others. I think that the positive thing that can come out of this is that we all have a much deeper understanding of violence, its impact on our society, and the need for peace.\\"Raskin, Patricia J.

Exhibition history and tour  Following the exhibition on Wooster Street in New York City from October 13 to January 8, 2002, the Project was shown in six other locations. At each of these venues an invitation was extended for visitors to contribute photographs they had taken. The motivation to have the Project tour was driven by the perception that \\"outside of New York, there is a disconnect, a sense of unreality about what happened here. This provides people with a quiet place to reflect, gather, and talk about how they feel about what happened,\\" Feldschuh said in an article in the trade publication Popular Photography.Resnick, Mason. \\"Dealing With it\\", \\"Popular Photography\\", December 2001. =Tour dates= * 26 Wooster Street, New York City (October 13-January 8, 2002) * Women in Military Service for America Memorial, Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Virginia (March 1-April 7, 2002) * Sacramento, California (April 26-June 2, 2002) * Armory Northwest, Pasadena, California (June 30-August 4, 2002) * Chicago, Harold Washington Library Center (August 17-September 21, 2002) * Detroit Public Library (October 15-November 23, 2002) * Atlanta (December 10, 2002 ‚Äì March 31, 2003) * New York Public Library (August 15-September 20, 2003) \\"Press Release: September 11 Photo Project On View at The New York Public Library Beginning August 15.\\" August 3, 2003.

Women farmers at work in their vegetable plots near Kullu town, Himachal Pradesh, India. Previously the area was a major producer of high-value apples, but rising temperatrures in the last few decades have forced almost all apple producers there to abandon their crop. For these farmers, switching to vegetable production has resulted in a major boost in incomes and livelihoods, illustrating that 350x350px India has a national tradition bound to agriculture fertility. In the North, the Indus valley and Brahmaputra region are critical agricultural areas graced by the Ganges and monsoon season. Based on 2011 World Bank data, only 17.5% of India's gross domestic product (GDP) is accounted for by agricultural production.. (2011): http://devdata.worldbank.org/AAG/ind_aag.pdf Yet for a majority of the country, an estimated 72% of the 1.1 billion people who live in rural India, it is a way of life.‚ÄúRole of Farm Women In Agriculture: Lessons Learned,‚Äù SAGE Gender, Technology, and Development 2010 http://gtd.sagepub.com/content/14/3/441.full.pdf+html Agriculture in India defines familial tradition, social relations and gender roles. Female in the agricultural sector, whether through traditional means or industrial, for subsistence or as an agricultural laborer, represents a momentous demographic group. Agriculture is directly tied to issues such as economic independence, decision-making abilities, agency and access to education and health services and this manner has created externalities such as poverty and marginalization, and compounded issues of gender inequality.* Background on Indian agriculture Based on 2012 data, India is home to the fourth largest agricultural sector in the world. India has an estimated 180 million hectares of farmland with 140 million of which are planted and continuously cultivated. Yet India's agricultural profile is shadowed by the controversial impacts of Green Revolution policies that were adopted in the 1960s and 70s with pressure from the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank. The Green Revolution brought a modern approach to agriculture by incorporating irrigation systems, genetically modified seed variations, insecticide and pesticide usage, and numerous land reforms. It had an explosive impact, providing unprecedented agricultural productivity in India and turned the country from a food importer to an exporter. Yet the Green Revolution also caused agricultural prices to drop, which damaged India's small farmers. India's agricultural sector today still faces issues of efficiency due lack of mechanization with poorer conditions of farmers, as well as small farm sizes. In India traditional agriculture is still dominant as many farmers depend on livestock in crop production, for manure as fertilizers, and the use animal powered ploughs. According to 2011 statistics, the average farm in India is about 1.5 acres, minuscule when compared the average of 50 hectares in France and or 178 hectares in United States and 273 hectares in Canada.June 25, 2011.\\"Farm Size and Productivity: Understanding the Strength of Smallholders and Improving Their Livelihoods.\\" The small farmer tradition of India can be drawn back to the first farm reforms of independent India. Known as the Laws of Divided Inheritance, the reforms were meant to limit the conglomeration of land, by mandating redistribution as land was divided among male inheritors from the prior generation. The perpetuation of these laws not only limits farm size but also bars women from ownership or inheritance. Furthermore, as small farmers face the increasing competition with larger farm operations an increasing number of men migrate to city centers for higher wages and employment. Women are in turn left to support the family structure and support small farm lifestyle. In 2011, the agricultural sector workforce in the subcontinent was 75% women.Singh, Roopam; Sengupta, Ranja (2009). \\"EU FTA and the Likely Impact on Indian Women Executive Summary.\\" Centre for Trade and Development and Heinrich Boell Foundation. A statistical profile In rural India, the percentage of women who depend on agriculture for their livelihood is as high as 84%. Women make up about 33% of cultivators and about 47% percent of agricultural laborers.Rao, E. Krishna (2006). \\"Role of Women in Agriculture: A Micro Level Study.\\" These statistics do not account for work in livestock, fisheries and various other ancillary forms of food production in the country. In 2009, 94% of the female agricultural labor force in crop cultivation were in cereal production, while 1.4% worked in vegetable production, and 3.72% were engaged in fruits, nuts, beverages, and spice crops. Women's participation rate in the agricultural sectors is about 47% in tea plantations, 46.84% in cotton cultivation, 45.43% growing oil seeds and 39.13% in vegetable production.2009.Centre for Trade and Development and Heinrich Boell Foundation. ‚ÄúEU FTA and the Likely Impact on Indian Women Executive Summary.\\" While these crops require labor-intensive work, the work is considered quite unskilled. Women also heavily participate in ancillary agricultural activities. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, Indian women represented a share of 21% and 24% of all fishers and fish farmers, respectively. Despite their dominance of the labor force women in India still face extreme disadvantage in terms of pay, land rights, and representation in local farmers organizations. Furthermore, their lack of empowerment often results in negative externalities such as lower educational attainment for their children and poor familial health. Gender division of labor In India, the typical work of the female agricultural laborer or cultivator is limited to less skilled jobs, such as sowing, transplanting, weeding and harvesting, that often fit well within the framework of domestic life and child-rearing. In cotton seed production, they are engaged in pollination activity which require patience & little bit precision. Many women also participate in agricultural work as unpaid subsistence labor. According to United Nations Human Development Report only 32.8% of Indian women formally participate in the labor force, a rate that has remained steady since 2009 statistics. By comparison men constitute 81.1%.UNHDR-2011 = Literacy = An estimated 52-75% of Indian women engaged in agriculture are illiterate, an education barrier that prevents women from participating in more skilled labor sectors. In all activities there is an average gender wage disparity, with women earning only 70 percent of men's wage.http://www.in.boell.org/downloads/Summary_agr.pdf Additionally, many women participate in agricultural work as unpaid subsistence labor. The lack of employment mobility and education render the majority of women in India vulnerable, as dependents on the growth and stability of the agricultural market.Satyavathi, C. Tara; Bharadwaj, Ch.; Brahmanand, P.S. (2010). \\"Role of Farm Women In Agriculture: Lessons Learned.\\" SAGE Gender, Technology, and Development = Arranged marriages and caste = In rural India, women's role in the household is greatly defined by social structure and familial ties. Arranged marriages specific to each caste system, determine their economic worth, and are expected early on in a woman's life. Depending on caste and economic class a woman's role can be determined as one of more in the public eye or predominantly of seclusion; a life in which women are expected to care for children and maintain the household. The typical rural Indian household is a patriarchal and partilocal one, in which a husband, or in his stead the oldest son will make the decisions for a family. Time allocation In addition to rigorous agricultural work that is undervalued and underpaid, women are also responsible for the well-being of the household. They care for their children, provide nutrition or usually take part in subsistence agriculture, and do chores around the house. Based on time allocation studies, which pinpoint exactly how a woman's hours are spent throughout the week, Indian women spend about 25 hours in a week doing household chores and five hours in caring and community work. Besides the 30 hours of unpaid work, women spend the same amount of time as men carrying out agricultural work.TNN, \\"Pay Parity Sought for Women in Agriculture.\\" The Times of India. April 24, 2012. Daughters typically supplement or substitute for mother's unpaid work around the household. Considered female tasks, the opportunity cost of girls' time for school is higher than that of sons. Girls do significantly more housework than boys, which compromises their schooling. Access to land and resources Critical resources such as land are also unevenly distributed by gender. Women seldom enjoy property ownership rights directly in their names. They have little control over decisions made in reference to land. Even with land in their names, they may not have actual decision-making power in terms of cropping patterns, sale, mortgage and the purchase of land. In India only 14.9% of households are female headed. Access to credit is difficult, since women lack many of the prerequisites for lending such as assets or ownership of property.\\"Social Technology and Gender Inequality in Rural India.\\" https://books.google.com/books?id=xLaLm4dfRMMC&pg;=PA203&lpg;=PA203&dq;=gender+division+of+labor+in+india&source;=bl&ots;=AxLSc7fpL-&sig;=Bkz_g_pJZwkdHaIvNm-9BMrBEAE&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=KNhoUYbPJYrWygH8xYCICg&ved;=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q;=gender%20division%20of%20labor%20in%20india&f;=false Without access to capital or household decision making abilities women lack the resources that are necessary for their labor stability and stability of their households. Furthermore, without access to support from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, banks, and cooperative societies, women are excluded from information that would make their production more competitive in the agricultural markets.Indian Council if Agricultural Research. ‚ÄúWomen in Agriculture‚Äù: DARE/ICAR Annual Report.\\" 2003-04. http://www.icar.org.in/files/ar0304/12-WOMEN%20IN%20AGRICULTURE.pdf The traditional systematic denial of women as key producers in India's agriculture causes them to often be overlooked in the research and study, thus further entrenching the exclusion of women in roles of agency. According to Amartya Sen, and Martha Nussbaum‚Äôs Capability Approach, equality in access is critical step to economic empowerment to create gender equality. In conjunction, the early access to education and health services is critical to the capabilities and self-actualization of girls. The attainment of these necessary life structures is determined by cultural norms as well as the economic standing of the family. Land ownership opportunities also have a critical impact on human development with freedom from violence. According to a 2005 study of marital violence and property ownership, 49% of propertyless women experience physical violence and 84% experienced psychological abuse. Ownership rights saw a drastic decrease in violence. Among women who owned both land and house there was only 7% physical violence and 16% psychological abuse.Pradeep Panda and Bina Agarwal. \\"Marital Violence, Human Development and Women‚Äôs Property Status in India.\\" Women farmers and the environment Extreme climatic changes are among the factors that have begun to jeopardize agricultural production globally. India's agricultural sector which depends greatly on the variations in climate and weather is defined mainly by the monsoon season. The appropriate levels of precipitation that last from June to September, predicate a bountiful agricultural yield later on in the year. Monsoon seasons with insufficient or excessive precipitation, hurts the agricultural sector.\\"Agricultural in India: Both Weak and Strong.\\" http://www.momagri.org/UK/focus-on-issues/Agriculture-in-India-Both-Weak-and- Strong_249.html Increasing temperatures and erratic precipitation has begun to exhaust agricultural land and create high variations of land. In the past couple of years these trends have made a noticeable impact in India, causing droughts and unpredictable rainfall. Just one season of such weather patterns can be devastating to the livelihood of farmers, who can find no resilience in small farms.\\"Inequality Deepens Climate Challenge for India's Women Farmers.\\" http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/inequality-deepens-climate-challenge-for- indias-women-farmers/ The loss of biodiversity in India and specifically food crops is a serious concern of food security and sustainability of the agricultural sector in India. The connection between women farmers and environmental health is not simply for subsistence and survival. It also stems from a long existing cultural valuation of India's agricultural fertility in ritual and practice. Women's connection to land is reflected in their almanac- like knowledge of plant varieties. Rituals and ceremonies in various parts of the country show this close relationship. There is Lohri, the harvest festival of Punjab or navadhanya puja, which translate to the worship of nine cereals, celebrations that take place in southern India. Both ceremonies celebrate the role of women in agriculture and fertility and importance of environment and biodiversity. Furthermore, traditional agricultural methods heavily utilized by women subsistence farmers boast environmentally friendly features, such as seed preservation, natural fertilizers and crop rotation techniques that do not exhaust delicate soil. In the wake of Green Revolution‚Äôs reforms, it is clear that many of the high yield recommendations had severe environmental impacts.Daniel Pepper. US News. \\"Toxic Consequences of the Green Revolution.\\" 2008. https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2008/07/07/the-toxic- consequences-of-the-green-revolution The negative environmental impacts of the Green Revolution are barely beginning to show their full affect. The widespread chemical pollution in communities that utilize pesticides and herbicides is creating a public health problem, which has disproportionately impacted women.https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103569390/ In the state of Punjab, which was touted as a success of Green Revolution, cancer rates have skyrocketed. A 2008 study by Punjabi University a high rate of genetic damage among farmers, which was attributed to pesticide use. Ignorance on the appropriate use of pesticides, resulting in the heavy use, improper disposal, the use of pesticides as kitchen containers, and contamination of drinking water with heavy metals are contributing factors. In reaction to the health and monetary costs of inorganic farming many women are turning to organic farming practices. On a micro level women are organizing into collectives to exchange knowledge, organize organic seed sharing, to pursue organic and sustainable agricultural practices. Cooperatives Cooperatives have been long seen as a social institution providing partnership, solidarity and resources to women farmers as well as tackle gender inequality. In India they have had quite a success. In many instances in which women are barred from participation, women only cooperatives are critical in empowering and educating. Yet female participation in cooperatives is still relatively low and some argue because men are still seen as primarily in charge of agriculture and income generation. Only 7.5% of women participate in cooperatives as compared to 92.5% of men. Of India‚Äôs 450,000 cooperatives with a membership of 204.5 million, there are only 8,171 women cooperatives with a total membership of 693,000 women.Daman Prakash. \\"Rural Women, Food Security, and Agricultural Cooperatives.\\" 2003. Despite that, women-only cooperatives, which include cooperative banks, stores, food vendors, have done quite well and provided a whole range of services to their members. In India, with a view to involve women in the process of decision-making in local self-governing bodies including cooperatives, a 33% representation has been instituted and in a number of states all boards of directors have women serving on them. International organizations such as the Self-Employed Women's Association (SEWA) have been working quite successfully in India with partners to form a membership of 1.24 million women in India. Fifty four percent of members are agricultural workers.Self-Employed Women's Association. (2011) http://www.sewa.org/ India-EU Free Trade Agreement Since 2007, India and the European Union have been in negotiation over a free trade agreement between the two bodies. It is an extension of the neoliberal policies posed by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank as developmentally advantageous to India. However, in the long run it is predicted that the EU-India FTA will not bring gains to the agricultural sector of India. Rather it is predicted by a study conducted by the Centre for Trade and Development in 2009, that the EU will benefit at the expense of the small Indian agricultural laborers and farmers. It is predicted there will be a small increase in agricultural exports that will be dwarfed by larger increase in agricultural imports. In addition agricultural employment will decline in India. Furthermore, there is concern about the social impacts of opening up of the Indian market to European Unions agricultural goods such as general and specialty food crops. The Free Trade Agreement may lead to increased imports of the products that women are typically involved in, such as cereal production, tea or coffee, confections, and oil seeds. With the EU's competitive advantage this will hurt a number of women farmers and laborers that are employed in these sectors. For example, EU dairy products, a heavily protected industry in the EU, will most likely enter Indian markets competing with smaller animal husbandry production methods specifically attached to women. Competition may threaten women's and their families‚Äô livelihoods and create problems of food security and deepen gender inequality by stifling the expansion of capabilities for girls and women. Agro processing, the creation of cereals and grains mixtures, in India is a large employer of women workers and strong competition can adversely affect them. In addition, since the EU has considerably lower tariffs than those in India, the FTA will induce a loss of tariff revenue in India, which will have to reduce tariffs. This will bring about a loss of revenue source generally used by the government on social spending.http://www.indianexpress.com/news/germany-voices-support-for-fta- between-india-and-eu/1100889/ The FTA, as insisted by the EU, will also remove export restrictions and increase the liberalization of investment in agriculture in India. This does not bode well for smaller Indian agricultural production industries that have thus far been insulated from such rough competition for resources. As foreign investors begin to vy for power over agricultural or natural resources in India, women's access to resources and decision-making abilities will be further threatened. Women who do agricultural work for subsistence will be at risk of losing the basic resources such as water, seeds and other natural resources used to feed their families. The Free Trade Agreement is still under negotiations. Since initial discussion of the free trade agreement there has been a major public outcry due to problems, besides those agricultural cited above, that are predicted to arise. In April 2013, Germany supported the free trade agreement. Progress on the FTA has been delayed due to EU demands that India open its markets further. Europe currently waits on India to raise its cap on ‚ÄúFDI by foreign insurance companies from 26 to 49 per cent‚Äù and also decrease import duties for luxury items such as cars, wine and spirits.

The beans will be sold to a local exporter, who will sell them to supermarkets in Europe. A cooperative (\\"co-op\\") is an autonomous association of persons who voluntarily cooperate for their mutual, social, economic, and cultural benefit through a mutually owned and democratically run enterprise.Statement on the Cooperative Identity. International Cooperative Alliance. Cooperatives include non-profit community organizations and businesses that are owned and managed by the people who use their services (consumer cooperatives) or by the people who work there (worker cooperatives) and take on a variety of forms, ranging from officially registered cooperatives to loosely organized groups of neighbors, family, and kin networks. Cooperatives are based on values like self-help, democracy, equality, equity, and solidarity.http://social.un.org/index/Cooperatives/WhatisaCooperative.aspx These values, among other aspects of cooperatives, are particularly useful in empowering women through membership. In statements in advance of International Women's Day in early 2013, President of the International Cooperative Alliance, Dame Pauline Green, said, \\"Cooperative businesses have done so much to help women onto the ladder of economic activity. With that comes community respect, political legitimacy and influence.\\"http://ica.coop/en/media/news/movement-can-give-strong-voice-women Cooperatives allow women who might have been isolated and working individually to band together and create economies of scale as well as increase their own bargaining power in the market. However, despite the supposed democratic structure and the values and benefits shared by cooperative members, particularly women, due to gender norms and other instilled cultural practices, women suffer a disproportionately low representation in cooperative membership around the world. Representation of women through active membership (showing up to meetings and voting), as well as in leadership and managerial positions is even lower. Women's cooperatives, run by and composed entirely of women, may be structured in a way that makes it easier for women to participate. Benefits of cooperatives to women Rachel MacHenry argues that cooperatives have several common features that are particularly beneficial to women, including \\"ensuring a fair return on work, support for members, safe working conditions, availability of pooled or purchased raw materials, and access to viable markets.\\"MacHenry, R. (2000). \\"Building on local strategies: Nepalese fair trade textiles.\\" In K. M. Grimes & B. L. Milgram (Eds.). Artisans and cooperatives: Developing alternative trade for the global economy (p. 25-44). Tucson, AZ: University of Arizona Press., p. 29. Furthermore, she says that they serve as a \\"crucial link\\" between Western markets and local kin-based structures in developing countries. In the same collection of essays, Brenda Rosebaum says that a cooperative can go beyond simply providing an income for the poor women members involved or stimulating the larger community in which it is located, cooperatives have \\"empowered\\" women, \\"enhanced their dignity, and greatly improved their quality of life.\\"Rosenbaum, B. (2000). \\"Of women, hope, and angels: Fair trade and artisan production in a squatter settlement in Guatemala City.\\" In K. M. Grimes & B. L. Milgram (Eds.)., Artisans and cooperatives: Developing alternative trade for the global economy (p. 85-106). Tucson, AZ: University of Arizona Press., p. 102 Ugandan women from the Hope Again cooperative socializing as they work making necklaces In a study of a Nepalese women's cooperative, Rachel MacHenry found that social barriers among women were broken down due to the inclusion of women of different classes, castes, and ethnicities. Moreover, these women often bonded over common experiences and similar motivations for participation in the cooperative. Other shifts occurred in women's independence, including reports of increased physical mobility, including more confidence walking alone as well as riding public transportation. Women also benefited from an increased self-worth and more confidence in interactions with family members and upper class people. Some women weavers felt that they had gained more bargaining power in the eyes of business people who had previously exploited them; other women claimed that they had gained a larger sense of their value and overall contribution to their own households.MacHenry, R. (2000). \\"Building on local strategies: Nepalese fair trade textiles.\\" In K. M. Grimes & B. L. Milgram (Eds.). Artisans and cooperatives: Developing alternative trade for the global economy (p. 25-44). Tucson, AZ: University of Arizona Press., p. 32-33. Another principal benefits of cooperative work is that it allows women the opportunity to gain a decent wage while still leaving time and freedom for other responsibilities important to them such as caring for children and families.Rosenbaum, B. (2000). \\"Of women, hope, and angels: Fair trade and artisan production in a squatter settlement in Guatemala City.\\" In K. M. Grimes & B. L. Milgram (Eds.)., Artisans and cooperatives: Developing alternative trade for the global economy (pp. 85‚Äì106). Tucson, AZ: University of Arizona Press., p. 102. Furthermore, benefits often trickle down to the children of women engaged in cooperatives. In the case of the cooperative UPAVIM in Guatemala, a strong emphasis was placed on savings for children's education. =Alternative/complement to microcredit= Much controversy surrounds microcredit loans in regards to empowering women, Karim argues, based on a 1999 ethnographic study, that microcredit nongovernmental organizations have too much power over the lives of rural people, which has a particularly detrimental effect on women. Karim highlights the negative tactics often used in loan recovery, in which group responsibility plays a large role and women's honor is publicly shamed if they default.Karim, L. (2008). De-mystifying micro-credit: The Grameen Bank, NGOs, and Neoliberalism in Bangladesh. Cultural Dynamics, 20(5), p. 5-29. Similarly, after conducting a 2008 study of small women entrepreneurs in Bangladesh, Jahiruddin et al. deduct that microcredit can even worsen poverty of borrowers in certain conditions. One-fourth of cases from a survey, spanning 35 villages and including 320 microcredit borrowers, showed no improvement in economic status of the borrowers, and in 6% of the cases poverty actually worsened due to various reasons like investment in activities that are slow to start generating revenue or encountering emergency circumstances that led to the use of the loan for other purposes.Jahiruddin, ATM, Short, P., Dressler, W., Khan, M. A. (2011). Can microcredit worsen poverty? Cases of exacerbated poverty in Bangladesh. Development in Practice, 21(8), p. 1109-1121. Cooperatives offer a way out of these negatives situations that microcredit puts women in due to the communal net and support that they provide through rough times. Furthermore, they allow women, who might have been isolated and working individually in the informal economy, to avoid loan defaults because they are able to join with other members to create economies of scale and increase their influence and bargaining power in the market. = Organizational Structures = Women's cooperatives are often built on ideas of sisterhood, equality, and strength from unity. Consequently, many have rejected hierarchical organizational structures in favor of more democratic participation where every member's input counts equally. Some cooperatives require consensus (instead of compromise or majority approval) for decision- making. Equal participation relies on individuals verbally articulating their opinions to the group; this in itself can be unequal since more experienced and articulate members can dominate discussions. Unlike in profit-oriented organizations, outcomes can be measured in terms of politics and policy, cultural outcomes, mobilization, and self-development.Desouza, Shaila (2012). \\"The Strength of Collective Processes: An 'Outcome Analysis' of Women's Collectives in India\\". Indian Journal of Gender Studies. 19(3): 373‚Äì392 ‚Äì via SAGE. = Sectors =Agricultural sector A farmer at the women‚Äôs agricultural cooperative of Walikaly village in Siguiri Prefecture, Guinea In Africa, though women account for roughly 80% of food production, they receive less than 10% of credit offered to small-scale farmers and only 7% of agricultural extension services. They own less than 1% of all land. By permitting women farmers to join together as a cooperative, individuals are better able to acquire inputs, production services, and marketing for their produce. This enhances productive capacity and opens access to markets that would not be possible for an individual operating alone. Furthermore, there is ‚Äúsolid evidence‚Äù that membership in a cooperative enhances productivity, income, and quality of life for the person involved, as well as the greater community. Care work sector Women are over-represented in paid care work the world over, and care work is oftentimes undervalued and underpaid. Those performing it have low levels of collective organization, low bargaining power, inadequate working conditions, as well as low access to business inputs that are needed in the care sector like in any other. Women also have gender- specific health needs regarding reproduction, and \\"are major (potential) consumers of health and care services, such as maternal health and maternity protection, HIV/AIDS prevention and mitigation, or child or elderly care services.\\" Cooperatives contribute to a positive change for working women both as providers and recipients of health care services. In Africa, where cooperatively organized care provision has in many cultural contexts been an intrinsic part of the social fabric, it is today gaining visibility, and increasing in the range of services provided and level of formality. For example, the Soweto Home-Based Care Givers Co-operative, which was set up in 2001, provides \\"nursing care, counseling, hospital transport and food parcel distribution to people living with HIV/AIDS\\". In other regions of the world, examples abound of women working in the care sector improving their working conditions and accessing much-needed services. For instance, the Self-Employed Women's Association (SEWA) in India runs cooperatively operated childcare centres and maternity benefits via an insurance cooperative as part of a holistic response to the needs of women. Craft and artisan sector Women in a Ugandan artisan cooperative, Hope Again, making necklaces By engaging in artisan cooperatives, women can gain new skills and training, access higher quality raw materials, and get paid for finished work directly upon delivery at the cooperative marketplace. In addition, they often have access to benefit programs for cooperative product producers. In a Nepalese textile cooperative, this included such things as, \\"a savings and loan system, retirement fund, bonus program, girl-child education fund, health services, peer counseling, legal counseling, and a fair price shop.\\"MacHenry, R. (2000). \\"Building on local strategies: Nepalese fair trade textiles.\\" In K. M. Grimes & B. L. Milgram (Eds.), Artisans and cooperatives: Developing alternative trade for the global economy (p. 25-44). Tucson, AZ: University of Arizona Press., p. 29. Cooperatives also secure connections with alternative trade organizations (ATOs) that help connect members with buyers, obtain orders, and export the artisan work to markets around the world.MacHenry, R. (2000). \\"Building on local strategies: Nepalese fair trade textiles.\\" In K. M. Grimes & B. L. Milgram (Eds.), Artisans and cooperatives: Developing alternative trade for the global economy (p. 25-44). Tucson, AZ: University of Arizona Press., pp. 29‚Äì30. Financial sector Savings and credit cooperatives (SACCOs) are much more accessible to women than standard banks, especially in rural areas, due to the fact that they are ‚Äúlocality-based,‚Äù making them more culturally sensitive and less intimidating. Moreover, they tend to offer a wider range of loan sizes, allowing women to find suitable loan conditions, such as smaller sizes to fit their business, health, or educational needs. Conflict areas Conflicts are rampant in the Middle East and cooperatives are thus able to make huge strides for women. Participation by women in these areas is especially limited and usually confined to small, women-only cooperatives, mainly because overall number of cooperatives equals less than 1 percent of employment opportunities in the occupied Palestinian territory, Lebanon, and Iraq combined. Women's land ownership and employment rates are also extremely low in these areas, with women holding less than one- fourth of all jobs. During times of conflict, cooperatives may be most advantageous because they enable members to accumulate savings, pool resources, access credit, and share risks. By combining the power of rural women in conflict states who would have achieved very little by themselves, cooperatives provide a functional tool for empowerment and economic independence, in addition to providing a ‚Äúlong-term sustainable socioeconomic recovery‚Äù following conflict. Barriers to women's participation=Legal constraints= A study carried out by the ILO found that cooperative laws are \\"gender neutral\\" and do not directly discriminate against women. However, in reality laws intended to protect women are ignored in favor of cultural norms or are maneuvered around.Nippierd, A. (2002). \\"Gender issues in cooperatives.\\" Geneva, Switzerland: International Labour Organization, p. 2 Most legal barriers to women's cooperative membership are largely indirect and written into cooperative bylaws, such as rules that only one member per family can have membership when the cultural norm encourages male membership as a first choice.ILO, Legal Constraints to Women's Participation in Cooperatives, ILO Cooperative Branch, Geneva, 2002. In agricultural cooperatives, it is often the case that membership requires land ownership, and since women are severely underrepresented in land ownership the world over, this serves to inhibit women from joining. =Traditional role of women= In many developing countries there is a \\"prevalent misconception\\" that reproductive and domestic roles should be a woman's most important job.Nippierd, A. (2002). \\"Gender issues in cooperatives.\\" Geneva, Switzerland: International Labour Organization When women attempt to add an income-earning job on top of other roles, pressure to uphold the unequal division of labor and care work in the household severely restricts their job choices, even putting them on the outside circle in cooperatives because there is little time left for mandatory meeting attendance and other tasks. In Latin America, machismo ideology permeates the culture and gives women virtually all the responsibility in child care, domestic work, and other subsistence activities. Furthermore, these domestic obligations inhibit women from accessing jobs that are better paid because they require uninterrupted work for long hours.Rosenbaum, B. (2000). \\"Of women, hope, and angels: Fair trade and artisan production in a squatter settlement in Guatemala City.\\" In K. M. Grimes & B. L. Milgram (Eds.)., Artisans and cooperatives: Developing alternative trade for the global economy (p. 85-106). Tucson, AZ: University of Arizona Press., pp. 88‚Äì89. Brenda Rosenbaum says that, \\"However hard they work, women at this level of poverty find it difficult to overcome the gender constraints imposed on them.\\"Rosenbaum, B. (2000). \\"Of women, hope, and angels: Fair trade and artisan production in a squatter settlement in Guatemala City.\\" In K. M. Grimes & B. L. Milgram (Eds.)., Artisans and cooperatives: Developing alternative trade for the global economy (pp. 85‚Äì106). Tucson, AZ: University of Arizona Press., p. 89. Many women get trapped by pressures and criticism from family members and neighbors that believe the independence cooperatives encourage is \\"immodest\\" or too \\"forward,\\" even to the extent of fathers or husbands forbidding involvement.MacHenry, R. (2000). \\"Building on local strategies: Nepalese fair trade textiles.\\" In K. M. Grimes & B. L. Milgram (Eds.), Artisans and cooperatives: Developing alternative trade for the global economy (pp. 25‚Äì44). Tucson, AZ: University of Arizona Press., p. 32. =Access to resources= Lack of access to resources inhibits women from creating new cooperatives and affects their roles in existing ones. Because women often lack their own independent assets, it is more difficult for them to invest in cooperatives on their own. Moreover, many women in developing countries suffer a disparity in levels of education, both overall and in relation to men, especially in regards to business experience and knowledge. Women's absence in land ownership on a large scale has also prevented their involvement in many agricultural cooperatives. Women's lack of access to finance, due to a variety of factors such as absence of collateral and negotiating power, is one of the main barriers to improving the productive capacity of women workers. The large majority of microfinance institutes view rural women as ‚Äú[ostensibly] a credit risk.‚Äù When women are approved for loans, they are often faced with unmanageably high interest rates, averaging 10% per month, which can deplete savings quickly. Although savings and credit cooperatives exist in developing countries to avoid dealing with microfinance institutions and are often the recipients of support services from the government, many are still male-dominated and discourage women from joining. For example, in Kenya, only 3% of women have access to the formal financial sector, as opposed to 44% of men. Funding and opportunities from government and other institutions may be limited depending on how cooperatives label themselves (‚Äúagricultural co-op‚Äù versus ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs co-op,‚Äù for example) Bonnan- White, Jess; Hightower, Andrea; Issa, Ameena (2013-09-01). \\"Of couscous and occupation: a case study of women's motivations to join and participate in Palestinian fair trade cooperatives\\". Agriculture and Human Values. 30 (3): 337‚Äì350. doi:10.1007/s10460-012-9405-7. ISSN 0889-048X.. Women‚Äôs cooperatives are sometimes dismissed as radical political groups, especially if the organization is new. This was the case for Saheli, a Mumbai-based cooperative for sex workers and victims of sex trafficking. Encouraging women's participation=International level= Since the early 1990s the promotion of gender equality has been a focus of the international cooperative movement. In 1995, the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) passed a resolution called \\"Gender Equality in Cooperatives\\" in which gender equality was named a global priority by members. The ICA has also been involved in the development of training materials on gender and cooperatives in various languages including French, English and Spanish, as well as leadership development manuals made especially for women in cooperatives.Nippierd, A. (2002). \\"Gender issues in cooperatives.\\" Geneva, Switzerland: International Labour Organization, p.5 In 2002, the International Labour Organization (ILO) released Recommendation No. 193 on the Promotion of Cooperatives Recommendation that explicitly states: \\"special consideration should be given to increasing women's participation in the cooperative movement at all levels, particularly at management and leadership level\\". Despite this and all of the benefits to women, as a reflection of larger society, women tend to be shut out of leadership and decision-making positions in mixed-gender cooperatives, and often do not benefit to the same extent as their male counterparts. The United Nations General Assembly declared 2012 as the International Year of Cooperatives (IYC) in hopes of spotlighting the contribution of cooperatives to economic development and social development, especially their effects on \\"poverty reduction, employment generation, and social integration.\\"United Nations, General Assembly (2012). Cooperatives in social development [A/RES/64/136]. New York City, NY. Retrieved from http://social.un.org/index/Cooperatives/InternationalYearofCooperatives2012.aspx =Cooperative level= Board members stand in front of their 'thrift cooperative' in Mulukanoor, Andhra Pradesh. A. Nippierd argues that on a more micro or local level, sensitizing managers and leaders of cooperatives to gender issues is a key starting point towards increasing gender equality. It is only with a full understanding of the issues and a strong decision to methodically address them that proactive measures begin to be enforced.Nippierd, A. (2002). \\"Gender issues in cooperatives.\\" Geneva, Switzerland: International Labour Organization, p. 5 This essential step should be partnered with other legal means such as \\"mainstreaming\\" gender equality into all cooperative policies, bylaws, statements, initiatives, and programs, etc. Gender analysis can also be utilized to pinpoint problem areas in policy or culture. Capacity-building of individual women should also be a focus for improving gender equality in cooperatives, especially due to the education gap and subsequent occupation gap commonly suffered by women in many developing countries. Special care should be taken to ensure that women represent an equal proportion in training and educational programs. Furthermore, these programs should be particularly sensitive to the needs of women, even going to the extent of specific designs where necessary, and should also include confidence-building measures. Identifying women as potential leaders and encouraging and supporting them through advanced training, mentoring, and coaching has also been identified as a successful policy. In countries where women are particularly disadvantaged under the laws, Nippierd argues that cooperatives should join together in \\"national coalitions and alliances with gender advocacy organizations and other civil society organizations to lobby governments for equal rights (especially in property and asset ownership) and an effective legal framework and institutions that foster gender equality.\\" See also *Cooperative economics *History of the cooperative movement *List of cooperatives *Microfinance / microcredit *Participatory economics *Social enterprise References Category:Cooperatives Category:Feminist economics Category:Businesswomen ","title":"Women in cooperatives"},{"id":"38227525","text":"Liberian women, 2008. The extent of gender inequalities varies throughout Liberia in regard to status, region, rural/urban areas, and traditional cultures. In general, women in Liberia have less access to education, health care, property, and justice when compared to men. Liberia suffered two devastating civil wars from 1989‚Äì1996 and 1999‚Äì2003. The wars left Liberia nearly destroyed with minimal infrastructure and thousands dead. Liberia has a Human Development Report ranking of 174 out of 187 and a Gender Inequality Index rank of 154 out of 159.\\"HDI, GII.\\" UNDP Human Development Report. : (http://hdr.undp.org/en/composite/GII, 2017.

Washington D.C.: The World Bank, 2012. 1. Gender roles In Liberia, men and women have clear gender divisions of labor. Women typically clean, cook, and take care of children, but their contributions to the family are rarely recognized as work. Men are seen as the head of the households and the breadwinners. Women are held back in society by biases in education, health care, land ownership, and credit, along with cultural practices like pre-arranged marriages and female genital mutilation.Population Growth and Distribution\\" In Consideration of reports submitted by states parties under article 18 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women combined initial, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth periodic reports of states parties : Liberia.. New York: United Nations, 2008. p 33 These factors constrain women from entering the workforce. The traditional role of women as caretaker in Liberian society is an example of Martha Nussbaum's idea of a resource-based approach, favoring protection of the status quo.Nussbaum , Martha . \\" In Promoting Women's Capabilities\\". p 253. Shifts Toward Gender Equality in Liberia After the UN signed the peace treaty with Liberia in 2003, the gender roles that restricted women from achieving equality began to change. After the wars in Liberia ended, initially there was little to no participation from women in positions of power, organizations or in government. Now, there are over 100 women's organizations according to the Women's NGO Secretariat of Liberia (WONGOSOL). These organizations serve to feed funds to local powerful women leaders. In comparison to other countries affected by wars, women in Liberia have been successful in making their voices heard in politics despite male resistance. In terms of women in politics, Liberia had elected their first female president Ellen Sirleaf in 2006, a step toward progression in a developing country. Recently, the National Institute for Public Opinion (NIPO) has raised awareness of women empowerment and equality through organizing the 16 Days of Activism. Through this month long campaign, it brought awareness to the legalities women were entitled to both nationally and internationally as well as female participation in politics and policy making. On a more international scale, with assistance from Sweden, UN women have reached out to men to join the fight against gender based violence. As part of the campaign, twelve men were nominated to become ambassadors to bring awareness and encourage other men to take a stand against violence against women. While there has been some progress, in order to fulfill the MDG development goal of promoting gender equality and empowering women there are still some areas to improve on such as addressing the gender discrimination in law, unequal job opportunities and wage gaps as well as a lack of equal women's participation in decision making. Violence against women=Sexual violence during the Liberian Civil Wars= During the First Liberian Civil War, there were widespread reports of sexual violence towards women. After the war, a survey taken of 205 women in the capital city of Monrovia showed that 49% experienced at least one type of physical or sexual violence by a soldier; 17% reported being beaten, tied up, or detained by an armed guard; 32% were strip-searched; and 15% experienced rape, attempted rape, or sexual coercion. Sexual coercion refers to a forced sexual relationship between a soldier and a woman who is forced into the relationship because of wartime conditions in order to feed herself or her family, to have shelter and clothing, or for protection and safety. After the Second Liberian Civil War, the International Rescue Committee reported that it had assisted almost 1,000 women and girls who had suffered gender-based violence in Montserrado County. 63% of the assaults were rapes.No Impunity for Rape- A crime against humanity and a war crime. https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AFR34/017/2004: Amnesty International , 2004. p 3-7. The IRC also surveyed Liberian women and girls between the ages of 15 and 49 in refugee camps in Sierra Leone. 74% of those surveyed reported having been subject to sexual violence. The majority of incidents were improper sexual comments, with sexual touching, stripping, and cavity searches also common.Nothing Left to Lose: The Legacy of Armed Conflict and Liberia's Children. http://www.watchlist.org/reports/files/liberia.report.php#gbv: Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict, 2004. Post-War Gender Violence Outcome After the wars ended, the opening ceremony of the peace negotiations was held on June 4, 2003 in Ghana, Liberia. A significant issue during these negotiations for peace is that there were none addressing the sexual violence crimes suffered by both women and children, land rights or even a discussion to include women's rights to education, despite five women being present during these negotiations. Despite Liberia passing the Rape Amendment Act in 2006 to impose stricter punishments and offering no bail to accused rapists, it was found that many women's groups had never even seen the new law. One solution that was offered in December 2008 was the creation of a rape court in order to fast track rape cases to give the victims closure. However due to the weaknesses and corruptions of the court system, many victims and their families were reluctant to press charges due to the system ruling in favor of men. While this is a step to improve the quality of life for women it does not solve the problem of sexual violence. = Women soldiers= Women and girls were abducted in the thousands and forced to fight and move supplies. Many of the older girls and women were sent directly to the front line without receiving any military training. A woman resisting or refusing a commander's orders risked being beaten, raped or killed. =Ethnic violence= Women belonging (or accused of belonging) to certain ethnic groups or factions had an increased risk for sexual violence, being forced to cook for soldiers or becoming sex slaves. In a 1998 survey of 106 women in Monrovia accused of being an ethnic group or faction member- 61% reported being beaten, locked up, strip searched, or raped. Women forced to cook for soldiers had even higher chances of sexual coercion or rape. Female genital mutilation Female genital mutilation is prevalent in some ethnic groups throughout Liberia (which?). The civil wars led to a decrease in female genital mutilation due to upheaval of life in rural areas, but the practice is still common.OECD Atlas of Gender and Development: How Social Norms Affect Gender Equality in non-OECD Countries, OECD Publishing, 2010. p 237. A 2007 study indicates that 52.8% of women ages 15‚Äì29 in the Sande Society have been subjected to female genital mutilation.Population Growth and Distribution\\" In Consideration of reports submitted by states parties under article 18 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women combined initial, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth periodic reports of states parties : Liberia..

The majority of victims do not speak out against the practice for fear of being ostracized or killed by community members.Population Growth and Distribution\\" In Consideration of reports submitted by states parties under article 18 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women combined initial, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth periodic reports of states parties : Liberia.. New York: United Nations, 2008. p 68. Education= Inequalities = When it comes to education in Liberia, boys are favored over girls to go to school. In most cases the extended family will fund the education for boys but rarely girls. This is an example of Amartya Sen's theory of Special Opportunity Inequality: education opportunities are less for girls than for boy in both primary and secondary education.Sen , Amartya . \\"Many Faces of Gender Inequality .\\" Frontline, November 9, 2001. The reason for education inequality of boys over girls is typically families believe an educated woman will take her education to her husband's family, resulting in a loss to their family. Regardless of sex, if the family is able to pay for a child‚Äôs education they are usually steered toward gender specific occupation. Boys are taught the sciences and mathematics while girls are taught nursing and teaching.Olukoju, Ayodeji. \\"Gender Roles, Marriage and Family.\\" Culture and Customs of Liberia . Westport : Greenwood Press, 2006. p 102. In 2007, the literacy rate for adult men was 55% and women was 41%.OECD/African Development Bank/United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. African Economic Outlook 2009, OECD Publishing, 2009. p 360. \\"Literacy (and education in general) is very much connected to women's ability to form social relationships on a basis of equality with other and to achieve the important social good of self- respect.\\" Nussbaum, Martha . \\"Women's Education: A Global Challenge.\\" Signs Winter (2004): 335. \\"Illiteracy, moreover, is strongly linked, as I have already argued, to other forms of injustice: domestic violence without exit options and unequal political and employment opportunities.\\" Nussbaum, Martha . \\"Women's Education: A Global Challenge.\\" Signs Winter (2004): 341. \\\\- Martha Nussbaum = Education laws= In 2001 an education law was enacted making primary education free and compulsory, though resources have not been adequate to implement the policy nationwide.Wodon, Quentin. \\"Brief Overview .\\" In Poverty and the Policy Response to the Economic Crisis in Liberia . Washington D.C.: The World Bank, 2012. p 37. Since her election in 2006, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has worked to promote school enrollment. In 2012 primary school enrollment in urban areas was 63.7% for girls and 86.8% for boys, in rural areas it was 33.1% for girls and 44.9% for boys. The reason for the gender inequality is that boys are seen to be more likely to use their education to contribute to household wealth.Wodon, Quentin. \\"Brief Overview .\\" InPoverty and the Policy Response to the Economic Crisis in Liberia . Washington D.C.: The World Bank, 2012. p 40. As a result of the education law, youths who had previously little or no access to education have been returning to school. A 2006 school census showed that 15% of the students in primary school were ages 6 to 7 years old, and half of the students were ages 11 to 20. =Reasons for low education= The main contributors to the overall low levels of education for Liberians is the lack of infrastructure in schools, security problems across the country and the high cost of education. A 2006 census from the Liberian Ministry of Education found that one in five schools in Liberia had been destroyed during the wars. Many schools were without water and restrooms, along with more than 60% of teachers lacking formal qualifications and being paid very low salaries ($200‚Äì$300USD per year).Wodon, Quentin. \\"Brief Overview .\\" In Poverty and the Policy Response to the Economic Crisis in Liberia . Washington D.C.: The World Bank, 2012. p 46. For people living in indigenous/rural areas there are many reasons for low levels of education including, limited access to schools, curriculum not being seen as relevant for rural life, the expense of sending children to urban areas for school, the belief that education will alienate their children from cultural values and in the case of girls, the belief that modern careers favor men.Dunn-Marcos,, Robin, Konia Kollehlon, Bernard Ngovo, and Emily Russ. \\"Reasons for Educational Inequalities.\\" In Liberians: An Introduction to Their History and Culture. Washington, DC 2: Center for Applied Linguistics, 2005. 38, 39.

Liberia Demographic and Health Survey 2007. Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS) and Macro International, Monrovia, Liberia. This growth is caused by a large percent of the female population being of reproductive age, along with early marriage practices (approximately 48% married by age 18 in 2007) and widespread polygamy, especially in rural areas.Population Growth and Distribution\\" In Consideration of reports submitted by states parties under article 18 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women combined initial, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth periodic reports of states parties : Liberia..

The devastating Liberian Civil Wars destroyed the country's health infrastructure. Even finding accurate numbers on maternal mortality is difficult because most cases go unreported, along with problems recording traditional births.Jody R. Lori, Amy E. Starke, A critical analysis of maternal morbidity and mortality in Liberia, West Africa, Midwifery, Volume 28, Issue 1, February 2012, Pages 67-72 =HIV/AIDS= The transmission of HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa is primarily through heterosexual intercourse, mother-to-child transmission, and contaminated blood and unsterilized medical equipment. With greater use of health services during pregnancy, there is a higher chance of HIV infection due to contaminated equipment. The risk of HIV increases with malnutrition and parasite-burdened people, which is a very real problem for the citizens of Liberia. There is a widely held belief across Sub-Saharan Africa that sex with a virgin cures HIV. The HIV/AIDS prevalence in Liberia is low, at 1.5%.UNICEF - At a glance: Liberia - Statistics.\\" UNICEF - UNICEF Home. http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/liberia_statistics.html#59 (accessed March 28, 2013). In areas where women are not allowed to own land, they have less of an ability to practice safe sex without risking fear of abandonment. In 2004 the United Nations Development Program gave Liberia $24 million in funding to aid in the treatment of individuals with HIV/AIDS, many of which were victims of sexual violence. Legal framework=Civil and customary laws= Liberia operates on a dual system of law. Civil law is based on Anglo-American ideals, and customary law is based on customs and unwritten tribal practices. Because of this system women are subject to more inequalities when living in rural/tribal areas. Customary law is the default except when it conflicts with the constitution. However, in practice, customary laws conflicting with the constitution generally go unchecked by the statutory system.Population Growth and Distribution\\" In Consideration of reports submitted by states parties under article 18 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women combined initial, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth periodic reports of states parties : Liberia..

New York: United Nations, 2008. p 77. =Civil rights= Under the civil law, men and women share the same legal rights. Women are able to inherit land or property, take out bank loans, and have custody over children. Under customary law women cannot inherit land or property and have no rights to custody or parental authority. Liberian women have had the right to vote since 1945.Dunn-Marcos, Robin, Emily Russ, Konia Kollehlon, and Bernard Ngovo. \\"A Stratified Society.\\" In Liberians an Introduction to their History and Culture. Washington, DC: Center for Applied Linguistics, 2005. pg 5. =Marriage= There are gender inequalities in marriage law because the minimum legal age of marriage is 18 for women and 21 for men. One third of married women in the age group 15-49, are in polygamous marriages.OECD Atlas of Gender and Development: How Social Norms Affect Gender Equality in non-OECD Countries, OECD Publishing, 2010. p 236. In 2004 the United Nations estimated that 36% of girls from 15-19 were married, divorced or widowed. While polygamy in Liberia is illegal under civil law, customary law allows men to have up to 4 wives.Olukoju, Ayodeji. \\"Gender Roles, Marriage and Family.\\"Culture and Customs of Liberia . Westport : Greenwood Press, 2006. p 97. Customary law restricts a married woman's rights to inherit property from her spouse. When widowed, women are at the mercy of the customary laws that are not subject to the civil courts.Olukoju, Ayodeji. \\"Gender Roles, Marriage and Family.\\"Culture and Customs of Liberia . Westport : Greenwood Press, 2006. p 98. =Bodily integrity= The law does not protect a woman‚Äôs bodily integrity in Liberia. Though violence against women is illegal, the levels of domestic violence and sexual assault are high. The definition of rape was broadened in 2006 to make spousal rape a criminal offense. Martha Nussbaum describes bodily integrity in her capabilities approach as \\"being able to move freely from place to place; to be secure against violent assault, including sexual assault and domestic violence; having opportunities for sexual satisfaction and choice in matters of reproduction.\\"Nussbaum , Martha . \\" In Promoting Women's Capabilities\\". p 249. Education plays a significant part in a woman's bodily integrity. As women become more educated, they take charge of decisions affecting their lives that once may have been made by their husbands, family members, or by social norms. Nussbaum says that \\"the role of education in developing central human capabilities in no sense implies that, without education, women do not have selves worthy of respect or basic human dignity.\\" Nussbaum, Martha . \\"Women's Education: A Global Challenge.\\" Signs Winter (2004) p 337. Women in politics The role women have played in Liberian politics has been substantial. Women helped to end the Second Liberian Civil War with the Mass Action for Peace Movement in 2003 led by Leymah Gbowee. Women's participation in politics has risen to 13.5% in 2011. Liberia ranks 90 out of 193 for female representation.Cole, Samuel . \\"Executive Summary.\\" In Increasing Women's Political Participation in Liberia . Washington DC : International Foundation for Electoral Systems, 2011. p 1 Women in indigenous society=Grebo people= The Grebo are a group of indigenous peoples living in southeastern Liberia. The Grebo culture is divided into uncivilized and civilized groups. Uncivilized families typically have less money and opportunity, and women are expected to work. Civilized families have higher status and greate land, money, and political involvement. In uncivilized Grebo families, women do the majority of the work in the fields, hoeing, planting seed, weeding, harvesting and processing crops. They are responsible for planting rice fields along with cultivating and sell the cash crops. Although women in Grebo culture are the breadwinners, they are still acknowledged as subordinate to their husbands, and expected to contribute to household wealth.Olukoju, Ayodeji. \\"Gender Roles, Marriage and Family.\\"Culture and Customs of Liberia . Westport : Greenwood Press, 2006.p 100. In civilized families, the man is the breadwinner and the woman is the homemaker. These civilized husbands take great pride that their wives do not work to earn a living, but rather devote themselves to childcare.Olukoju, Ayodeji. \\"Gender Roles, Marriage and Family.\\"Culture and Customs of Liberia . Westport : Greenwood Press, 2006.p 101. Civilized Grebo culture revolves around a dual-sex system, there are prestigious positions with political functions for women and men. Neither men or women represent each other and both groups are recognized and hold legitimate status. This system allows for women to rise in the hierarchy without being dominated by men, giving women more economic independence and rights. The dual-sex system allows for two town chiefs, one man and one woman, both are more independently elected, sharing no family ties. Gender biases exist in this system, such as women with no property have less of a chance to become a member of the civilized group, whereas men with no property will not experience this obstacle.Moran, Mary.

Presented by Black Balloon Publishing, The Recipe Project includes a CD of the recipes of famous chefs put to music, as well as a book in which those recipes are written down (not unlike lyrics) plus interviews with the chefs themselves, and the thoughts of top culinary writers. The project began when co-founders of the band One Ring Zero, Michael Hearst and Joshua Camp decided to take the recipe for Brains and Eggs by American chef Chris Cosentino and use it, word for word, as song lyrics, and as an added bonus collaborated with the chef by asking him what kind of genre of music he would prefer his recipe be sung as. Their little idea soon snowballed into a huge project that brought together world class chefs like Mario Batali, Isa Chandra Moskowitz, Tom Colicchio, musicians, writers and foodies alike, and went on to ask some interesting questions about the nature of the relationship between food and music. For instance, after hearing of the project, Grub Street San Francisco wrote, \\"So if chefs are like the new rock stars, should chefs also get to be actual rock stars?\\". The reviews for the project were for the most part very positive, Edible Brooklyn called the CD \\"A feast for the ears,\\".

It stars Christopher Atkins, Amanda Wyss, Ari Meyers and Roddy McDowall battling a baboon which has been driven insane by an experimental drug. Despite negative reviews, the film has achieved a small cult audience.  Plot  Shakma, a hamadryas baboon belonging to medical student Sam (Atkins), is injected by Sam's professor Sorensen (McDowall) with an experimental variation of corticotropin intended to inhibit aggression. When Shakma awakes and goes berserk, Sorensen instructs Sam to euthanize him, but Sam cannot bring himself to carry out the order and leaves Shakma unconscious. Before fellow student Richard can cremate Shakma, Sorensen insists on performing a necropsy the following day, and Shakma is left alive. That night, Sorenson organizes a live-action role-playing game for Sam and his colleagues Gary, Bradley, Richard and Tracy (Wyss). The objective of the game is to reach Richard's younger sister Kim (Meyers) on the top floor. The players are issued walkie-talkies, which allow communication with only Sorenson, the gamemaster. As part of the game's preparation, Sorensen disables the fire alarm system and locks the offices and building to disallow any player from leaving until the end of the game. Shakma, who has since regained consciousness, murders Bradley when he ventures into the specimen room on the fifth floor. Richard is also killed while investigating Bradley's whereabouts on Sorensen's instruction. Sorensen investigates the players' disappearances personally and finds Richard's mutilated body before falling prey to Shakma himself. The sound of Shakma's slaughter alerts Sam and Tracy to his presence, but they are unable to use the elevator as Sorensen's body is jamming the door. Sam takes the stairs to the fifth floor and unsuccessfully attempts to tame Shakma before fleeing the floor along with Tracy. Tracy goes to the electricity lab to collect a strobe light that she uses the light to temporarily blind Shakma, and she holds the specimen room door shut while Sam goes to locate and remove Sorensen's body from the elevator. When Tracy confirms Richard's presence in the specimen room, she distracts Shakma while Sam goes to recover Richard, but Shakma returns before he is able to recover from the shock of discovering his body, and Sam and Tracy narrowly escape Shakma's pursuit once more. As Sam and Tracy begin a search for Gary and Bradley, Gary is murdered while using the elevator, which allows Shakma onto the sixth floor. Tracy is murdered in the floor's restroom shortly after. Sam goes to the top floor to warn Kim (without letting her know of Richard's death), arms himself with a kitchen knife and continues his search for the others while Kim stays to attract the attention of Richard's girlfriend Laura, whose car is parked below. As Sam finds Gary's and Tracy's bodies as well as Sorensen's keys, Laura drives away, and Kim decides to go find Richard herself after leaving a hand-written note for Sam; she is killed by Shakma after finding Richard's body. Sam, after finding Bradley's and Kim's bodies, prepares to alert the police from Sorensen's office, but his guilt over the deaths of his colleagues drives him to kill Shakma himself. He sets up a trap to electrocute Shakma, who avoids the trap and gravely injures Sam. Shakma is ultimately burned to death when Sam manages to lure Shakma into the incinerator. Sam collapses in a hallway and declares \\"I win\\" to a nearby monkey doll. Cast * Christopher Atkins as Sam * Amanda Wyss as Tracy * Ari Meyers as Kim * Roddy McDowall as Sorenson * Rob Edward Morris as Gary (as Robb Morris) * Tre Laughlin as Bradley * Greg Flowers as Richard * Ann Kymberlie as Laura * Donna Jarrett as Brenda Production Shakma is portrayed by Typhoon, pictured here with his trainer Gerry Therrien The monkey playing Shakma is called Typhoon and was handled by Gerry Therrien of Action Animals. Although the title might be read to indicate it is a chacma baboon, Typhoon was actually a hamadryas baboon. Actress Amanda Wyss was terrified of the animal. Filming took place at Universal Studios Florida. Release Shakma had a limited theatrical run before being released on VHS in 1990. It would get a barebones budget DVD release on October 16, 2007, and a more substantial Blu-ray version from Screen Archives Entertainment under its Code Red label in 2013. This edition features an interview with director Tom Logan, commentary by Logan and David Decoteau, and host segments by Katarina Waters. It was only released in a limited 3000-copy print run. A DVD with the same features came out on October 13, 2015. In April 2015, Shakma was made available on streaming video from Shout! Factory. It is also available on Amazon Video and was once on Netflix. A new HD master of Shakma was released by Code Red DVD on Blu-ray in a limited edition of 3000. Reception Critical reception for Shakma was highly negative upon its release, with many panning the film's weak humor, shoddy effects, and flat direction. Eric Snyder of MTV criticized the film's extended dull stretches, weak characters, soundtrack, and poorly executed attack sequences. Kurt Dahlke from DVD Talk panned the film, awarding it 1.5 out of a possible 5 stars, writing, \\"While it might sound delightfully bad, Shakma's tale of a murderous monkey knocking off role-playing med-students pisses on the line between so-bad-it's-good and downright insulting with willful disobedience. It's not funny, scary, or much of anything more than bewildering and tiresome.\\" Maitland McDonagh from TV Guide gave the film 1 out of 5 stars, stating that the film \\"veers between the creepy and the profoundly silly\\", also noting that the role-playing aspect was \\"painfully dated\\". Katie Rife of The A.V. Club called the film \\"standard\\" and criticized the film's \\"laughable\\" dialogue, role-playing sub-plot, and acting. Dread Central rated the film a score of 2.5 out of 5, stating that the film's camp value was its primary source of entertainment. The film was listed on IFC's \\"The 25 best Animal Attacks in Movie History\\", stating that the film was \\"Pretty stupid as these things go, but at least it gives it the old college try\\". Regardless, the film has gained a small cult following over the years.

A very important economic event, the cattle count was controlled by high officials, and was connected to several cultic feasts. In addition it served as a means of dating other events, with the entire year when it occurred being called \\"year of the Xth cattle count under the person of the king Y\\". The frequency of cattle counts varied through the history of ancient Egypt; in the Old Kingdom it was most likely biennial, i.e. occurring every two years, and became more frequent subsequently.  Process and purpose  Cattle count after a relief in Mastaba tomb G75 at Giza. To perform the cattle count, all chattel (including productive livestock such as cows and oxen, sheep, pigs, goats and donkeys) were rounded up and counted. Following the count, the percentage of chattel to be taxed by the state would be calculated. The cattle count was performed in every nome of Egypt. Fraud was harshly punished. From the 2nd Dynasty onwards, the cattle count was connected with the \\"Following of Horus\\" (Egypt. Shemsu Hor) which occurred every two years. The Shemsu Hor consisted of a journey by the king and his court throughout Egypt which facilitated the assessment and levying of taxes by the central administration.  Importance  The cattle count is of great importance to Egyptologists and historians, because many inscriptions report the year of the x-th occasion of the cattle count followed by the name of a pharaoh. Thus these inscriptions are used to assess the minimum duration of the reign of the pharaoh, for example assuming that the cattle count was held every two years. This last point being of paramount importance for correct datation of reign lengths, it is highly disputed up to this day. According to the Palermo stone, a black basalt stone slab recording the yearly events of cultic and religious nature from king Narmer (1st Dynasty) down to king Neferirkare Kakai (3rd pharaoh of the 5th Dynasty), the cattle count was performed every second year until the late Old Kingdom. After this period, however, it was performed more frequently and finally yearly. The first pharaoh during whose reign yearly cattles counts are known to have taken place with certainty is king Pepi I of the 6th Dynasty.Siegfried Schott: Alt√§gyptische Festdaten (= Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur. Abhandlungen der Geistes- und Sozialwissenschaftlichen Klasse. Bd. 10, 1950, ISSN 0002-2977). Verlag der Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur, Mainz u. a. 1950.Thomas Schneider: Lexikon der Pharaonen. Albatros, D√ºsseldorf 2002, , p. 100‚Äì102. This does not exclude that the cattle count necessarily took place every second year before Pepi I. An example of conflicting evaluations for a reign duration via cattle count is the case of king Khufu (4th Dynasty). The highest known numbers of cattle counts under Khufu are found in workmen's graffiti inside the relieving chambers of the Khufu pyramid. The ink inscription reports the \\"17th occasion of the cattle count\\". Since the Palermo stone inscriptions hold that the cattle count was performed every second year during the 4th Dynasty, it would prove that Khufu ruled at least 34 years. This calculation is rejected by several Egyptologists, because another ancient Egyptian source, the Turin canon, credits Khufu with a reign of merely 23 years. At the opposite, the ancient Greek historian Herodotus claims that Khufu ruled for 50 years, which is now seen as an exaggeration. Meanwhile, today Egyptologists such as Thomas Schneider assume that either Khufu indeed ruled for a little over 34 years, or that the author of the Turin canon simply did not take into account the 2-year-cycle of cattle counts and in fact credits Khufu with 23 cattle counts, which is a reign of 46 years.

The most reported effects of the pandemic took place October 1889 ‚Äì December 1890, with recurrences in March ‚Äì June 1891, November 1891 ‚Äì June 1892, winter 1893‚Äì1894 and early 1895. It is not known for certain what agent was responsible for the pandemic. Since the 1950s it has been conjectured to be Influenza A virus subtype H2N2. A 1999 seroarcheological study asserted the strain to be Influenza A virus subtype H3N8. A 2005 genomic virological study says that \\"it is tempting to speculate\\" that the virus might not have been actually an influenza virus, but human coronavirus OC43. Danish researchers reached a similar conclusion in 2020, in a yet-unpublished study. Outbreak and spread Modern transport infrastructure assisted the spread of the 1889 influenza. The 19 largest European countries, including the Russian Empire, had 202,887 km of railroads and transatlantic travel by boat took less than six days (not significantly different than current travel time by air, given the time scale of the global spread of a pandemic). It was the first pandemic to spread not just through Eurasia, but throughout the world. The flu was first reported in the Central Asian city of Bukhara in the Russian Empire, in May 1889, with up to two- thirds of the local population dying.Mouritz, A. (1921). The Flu. Retrieved 5 April 2020. Through the Trans-Caspian railway, it was able to spread further into Samarkand by August, and Tomsk, 3,200 km away by October. Since the Trans-Siberian Railway had not yet been constructed, spread in the eastern direction was slowed down, but it reached the westernmost station of the Trans-Caspian, Krasnovodsk (now known as T√ºrkmenba≈üy), and from there the Volga trade routes which carried it by November to Saint Petersburg (infecting 180,000 of the city's under one million inhabitants) and Moscow. By mid- November Kiev was infected, and the next month the Lake Baikal region was as well, followed by the rest of Siberia and Sakhalin by the end of the year. From St. Petersburg, the flu spread via the Baltic shipping trade to Vaxholm in early November 1889, and then to Stockholm and the rest of Sweden, infecting 60% of the population within eight weeks. First Norway, and then Denmark, followed soon after. The German Empire first received it in Pozna≈Ñ in December, and on the 12th, 600 workers were reported sick in Berlin and Spandau, with the cases in the city reaching 150,000 within a few days and ultimately half of its 1.5 million inhabitants. Vienna was also infected around the same time. Rome was reached by 17 December. The flu also arrived in Paris that month, and towards its end had spread to Grenoble, Toulon, Toulouse, Lyon, and Ajaccio. At this point Spain was also infected, killing up to 300 a day in Madrid. London got it the same time, from where it then spread quickly to Birmingham, Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Dublin. The first case on American soil was reported on 18 December 1889. It then quickly spread throughout the East Coast and all the way to Chicago and Kansas in days. The first death, Thomas Smith of Canton, Massachusetts, was reported on 25 December. San Francisco and other cities were also reached before the month was over, with the total US death toll at about 13,000. From there it spread south to Mexico and further down, reaching Buenos Aires by 2 February. Port Natal in South Africa was reached in November 1889, while India received it in February 1890, as did Singapore and Indonesia by March. These were followed by Japan, Australia, and New Zealand by April, and then China in May, and then returned to its original starting point in Central Asia. In four months it had spread throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Deaths peaked in Saint Petersburg on 1 December 1889, and in the United States during the week of 12 January 1890. The median time between the first reported case and peak mortality was five weeks. In Malta, the Asiatic Flu took hold between January 1889 and March 1890, with a fatality rate of 4% (39 deaths), and a resurgence in January‚ÄìMay 1892 with 66 fatalities (3.3% case fatality). When this flu began, whether it was contagious was debated, but its quick action and pervasiveness across all climates and terrains proved that it was.  Responses = Medical treatment = There was no standard treatment of the flu, with Quinine and Phenazone used, as well as small doses of Strychnine and larger ones of whiskey and brandy, and as cheaper treatments linseed, salt and warm water, and glycerin. Many people also thought that fasting would 'starve' the fever, based on the belief that the body would not produce as much heat with less food; this was in fact poor medical advice. Furthermore, many doctors still believed in the miasma theory of diseases, and neglected the possibility of infectious spread of disease. For example, notable professors of the University of Vienna, Hermann Nothnagel and Otto Kahler claimed that the disease was not contagious. = Public health = A result of the Asiatic flu in Malta is that influenza became for the first time a compulsorily notifiable illness. Identification of virus subtype responsible= Influenza virus = Researchers have tried for many years to identify the subtypes of Influenza A responsible for the 1889‚Äì1890, 1898‚Äì1900 and 1918 epidemics. Initially, this work was primarily based on \\"seroarcheology\\"‚Äîthe detection of antibodies to influenza infection in the sera of elderly people‚Äîand it was thought that the 1889‚Äì1890 pandemic was caused by Influenza A subtype H2, the 1898‚Äì1900 epidemic by subtype H3, and the 1918 pandemic by subtype H1. With the confirmation of H1N1 as the cause of the 1918 flu pandemic following identification of H1N1 antibodies in exhumed corpses, reanalysis of seroarcheological data has indicated that Influenza A subtype H3 (possibly the H3N8 subtype), is a more likely cause for the 1889‚Äì1890 pandemic. = Coronavirus = After the SARS epidemic, virologists started sequencing and comparing human and animal coronaviruses, and comparison of two virus strains in the Betacoronavirus 1 species, Bovine coronavirus and Human coronavirus OC43 indicated that they had a most recent common ancestor in the late 19th century, with several methods yielding most probable dates around 1890. Authors speculated that an introduction of the former strain to the human population might have caused the epidemic. In 2020, Danish researchers Lone Simonsen and Anders Gorm Pedersen similarly calculated that the human coronavirus OC43 had split from bovine coronavirus about 130 years ago, i.e. approximately coinciding with the pandemic in 1889‚Äì1890. The calculation was based on genetic comparisons between bovine coronavirus and different strains of OC43. Their research is yet to be published.  Pathology = Patterns of mortality = The young, the old, and those with underlying conditions were most at risk, and usually died of pneumonia or heart attack caused by physical stress. Due to generally lower standards of living, worse hygiene, and less- developed medicine, the numbers of vulnerable people were higher than in the contemporary world.

MESAB was a collaborative effort by Americans and South Africans to support the training of black South Africans in the health professions in an effort to improve health care for the black African population of South Africa. MESAB provided scholarships for black South African students at 26 South African universities and technikons, along with sundry training initiatives in community health clinics. MESAB was founded in 1985 by retired diplomat Herbert Kaiser and his wife Joy Kaiser and closed its doors in 2007. At the time of MESAB's founding, South Africa's apartheid policies dictated separate health facilities for blacks. These facilities were underfunded, underequipped, and understaffed compared with those provided to whites. Accomplishments From 1985-2007, MESAB's scholarship program provided a total of 11,243 grants (or, \\"bursaries\\") to needy students at 26 South African universities and technikons. In addition: * It pioneered South Africa's first mentor program to help students succeed. 6,000 students received guidance at 17 South African universities and technikons. * It supported advanced training for nurses in midwifery and neonatal care. * It encouraged and contributed to university rural outreach programs. * Its palliative care initiative promoted and supported home-based care for dying AIDS victims and training for doctors in palliative care. * It established awards for academic and professional achievement by black health professionals . Founding Context MESAB was founded by Herbert Kaiser, a retired diplomat, and his wife Joy. They believed that additional black health professionals would immediately improve access to health care and that these new caregivers would play a greater role in formulating health policy and become leaders in a post-apartheid future. In 1984 there were fewer than 350 black doctors in a black population of over 20 million. Blacks comprised 70% of the population, but only 3% of all doctors were black. The following statistics illuminate the problem: * Black life expectancy was 15 years less than for whites. * Maternal mortality was ten times greater for blacks than for whites. * Infant mortality was as high as 190 babies compared with 13.4 for white infants. * Deaths under the age of four: 55 percent of all deaths among blacks compared with 7 percent for whites. * Limited access to health care meant that blacks were dying from preventable diseases like TB, typhoid, gastroenteritis, and measles that were virtually eliminated in the white population. * Occupancy rates of 150% at hospitals for blacks were common, which often meant one in the bed and one on the floor. Board Structure The US Board of Directors was drawn from the worlds of medicine, academia, civil rights organizations, and business. Its role was to establish broad policy guidelines and raise funds. The first Chairman of the Board was Donald Kennedy, then president of Stanford University and former Director of the Federal Food and Drug Administration. He was succeeded by Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, president of the Morehouse School of Medicine and former US Secretary of Health and Human Services. The South African Council recommended and administered MESAB programs, among them financial aid and personal counseling. Its first Chairman was Professor Phillip V. Tobias, the noted paleoanthropologist and long-time opponent of apartheid. He was succeeded by Professor Mervyn Shear, who was followed by Dr. Nthato Motlana, a civic leader in Soweto and a close associate of Nelson Mandela. Council members were leaders of medical, educational, business, and community organizations. Funding Funding for MESAB came from corporate, foundation, and individual donors. Major contributors included Peter Bing, Peter Kovler, George Soros, David Tabatznik Bristol-Myers Squibb, Coca-Cola Co., Ford Motor Company, Henry Schein Inc., Hewlett Packard, Johnson & Johnson, Kaiser Permanente, Kellogg Foundation, Levi Strauss & Co., Pfizer, the Starr Foundation, and USAID, among many others. Over its 22 years of operations, MESAB raised over $27 million to help over 10,000 black students enter the health professions. Its graduates are now doctors, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, and other skilled caregivers responding to the health needs of all South Africans, especially those of black communities previously denied access to healthcare.

A specialist sprinter, he was trained first in Ireland and then in Britain during a racing career which lasted from 1945 until September 1947. After being beaten in his first three races he recorded ten consecutive victories including the Wokingham Stakes, July Cup, Nunthorpe Stakes, Diadem Stakes and Cork and Orrery Stakes. He was then injured and finished unplaced in his comeback race, ending with a record of ten wins from fourteen races. He was retired to stud where he had little success as a sire of winners. Background The Bug was an unimpressive-looking, lightly built chestnut horse, with a white blaze and a white sock on his right hind leg. He was bred in County Limerick, Ireland, by either Mary Ellard or S. Donoghue. As a yearling The Bug was sent to the Ballsbridge sales where he was bought for 700 guineas by the Hon. Gerald \\"Ginger\\" Wellesley, a relative of the Duke of Wellington. The colt raced in the colours of Norman Wachman, a boot and shoe manufacturer, as well as a noted gambler, and was trained by Wellesley at Castleknock, County Dublin. The Bug was sired by Signal Light, an Irish-bred stallion who won the Craven Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in 1939. Apart from The Bug, the best of his progeny was probably Big Dipper, the top-rated British two-year-old of 1950. His dam Flying Meteor came from an undistinguished branch of Thoroughbred family 2-d, although she was distantly related to the Derby Italiano winner Bellini. Racing career=1945: two- year-old season= Wellesley sent out The Bug to race five times in Ireland in 1945. He was unplaced in his first two starts and was strongly supported in the betting when finishing second in his next race. Late in the season he won two minor races. The Bug was never an easy horse to manage: on one occasion he escaped from the stables and ran loose around the local countryside until he was led home by a police officer who used his bootlaces to fashion a makeshift head collar. =1946: three-year-old season= In early 1946, The Bug won two races at Phoenix Park Racecourse, carrying large weights in handicap races before being sent to race in England for the first time. In April at Liverpool Racecourse he won the Knowsley Stakes over one mile. In June he reverted to sprint distances when he ran in the Wokingham Stakes, a six furlong handicap at Royal Ascot in which he was ridden by Charlie Smirke, who became his regular jockey. He started at odds of 7/1 and won easily carrying 119 pounds, setting a weight-carrying record for a three-year-old in a race first run in 1874. His victory reportedly landed a huge gamble for Norman Wachman. The \\"tactics\\" employed on The Bug in this race were typical: he started quickly, took the lead, and had his opponents struggling to match his speed from the early stages. A month later he was back in England for the July Cup, one of the season's most important weight-for-age sprints over six furlongs at Newmarket. He started the 8/11 favourite and won from Honeyway, a five-year- old who had won the race in the 1945. After his win in the July Cup, The Bug was transferred to England for the rest of his career, joining the Newmarket stable of Marcus Marsh. Marsh found that the horse was a challenging one to manage: he had fragile legs and back problems which meant that he had to be trained with great care. In August, The Bug moved down in distance for the Nunthorpe Stakes over five furlongs at York Racecourse, where he won by one and a half lengths from the previous year's winner Golden Cloud. Press reports described the performance as a \\"dazzling run\\" which confirmed The Bug's status as the best sprinter in England. On his final start of the season, The Bug took the inaugural running of the Diadem Stakes over six furlongs at Ascot. By this time he was being described by some observers as \\"phenomenal\\" and \\"one of the fastest horses in living memory\\". =1947: four-year-old season= The Bug returned as a four-year-old but his training problems worsened and he made only two appearances. In June he returned to Royal Ascot where he won the Cork and Orrery Stakes by four lengths but sustained a back injury shortly afterwards which kept him off the course until autumn. At Ascot in September he moved up in distance for the one mile Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in which he was matched against the 2000 Guineas winner Tudor Minstrel. The Bug's back injury recurred during the race and he finished unplaced, sustaining his first defeat for two years. Assessment The independent Timeform organisation did not publish an annual for 1946, and so The Bug did not receive a rating in his best season. In 1947 he was rated on 135, the third highest of the year behind Tudor Minstrel (144) and the two-year-old My Babu (136), and equal to the French-trained stayers Souverain and Chanteur. In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated The Bug the best British or Irish-trained horse of his generation and the tenth-best British or Irish-trained sprinter of the 20th century. Stud career The Bug was retired to stud for the 1948 breeding season but proved a disappointing sire. His only winner of any consequence was Gillylees, a filly who won the Fern Hill Stakes at Ascot in 1958. The Bug died in 1963.

It was released in the UK on 14 September 1979 on GEM Records, a subsidiary of RCA. It is considered as a classic from the punk era. The style of music borrows heavily from blues and rock'n'roll but infused much of the energy and social commentary that was shaping the wider punk rock scene. Critics were divided on the album's merits. Writing for the New Musical Express, Charles Shaar Murray described the album as being \\"As appetising as the tea-bag left to dry on the saucer\\" , while in Sounds, Garry Bushell awarded the album five stars and called it \\"a near perfect slice of good time high energy punk.\\" The first 20,000 copies were printed on blue vinyl and the album reached number 21 in the UK album charts. The U.K. Subs have released 26 official albums, each beginning with a different letter of the alphabet. Their most recent, Ziezo, was released in 2016.

He won the Mr. Universe title four times in 1968, 1975, 1980 and 1981 and Mr. World in 1971 in the tall man's category, and Mr. America in 1978. After becoming involved in a life of crime, running one of the biggest escort services in California, he became an international evangelist. The 1983 edition of The Gold's Gym book of bodybuilding cited him as \\"one of the most successful bodybuilders of the past decade or two\\". He is an inductee of the National Fitness Hall of Fame, IFBB Hall of Fame and National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame. Biography=Early life= Tinerino was born into an Italian-American family in Brooklyn in 1945. At the age of 12 he resolved to become a champion bodybuilder and actor after looking in the mirror and feeling that he was \\"so skinny he could duck raindrops\\". His father, a boxer, started his training at the local YMCA. He grew up in a rough area, white in a black neighborhood, surviving numerous death threats, but remained focused. Attending East New York Technical High School from aged 13‚Äì16, he \\"packed three inches onto his arms, netting 16 inches total at a bodyweight of 175 pounds.\\" After graduating high school he worked for Olympic Radio and TV. There he met Joe Abbenda who became his mentor, along with Bill Pearl, advancing his training sessions to 5 days a week. =Bodybuilding= Tinerino won the Teen Mr. America, Mr. Atlantic Coast, Mr East Coast, and Mr. Brooklyn contests in 1964, and finished second to Arnold Schwarzenegger at the Mr. Universe contest in 1967 at the age of 21. He won the NABBA Mr. Universe title in England in 1968, and later in 1975, 1980 and 1981 in the tall man's category. He won the Mr. World contest in the tall man's category in 1971. He finished 6th overall in the 1977 Mr. Olympia contest, 3rd in the over 200 lb category, and 9th overall in the 1978 Mr. Olympia coast, 4th in the over 200 lb category. Tinerino also won the title of Pro Mr. Natural America in 1978. His last contest was in the 1982 Mr. Olympia, finishing in 14th place. In 1969 he portrayed Atlas in Schwarzenegger's debut film, Hercules in New York, released in February 1970. In the 1970s he appeared on the cover of magazines such as Muscle & Fitness, Muscular Development, Iron Man, and Strength & Health. The 1983 publication, The Gold's Gym book of bodybuilding, cited him as \\"one of the most successful bodybuilders of the past decade or two\\". In 1985, Robert Kennedy said of him, \\"this bodybuilding superstar has won every major competition except the Mr. Olympia title. To his credit, he is the only major champion to win a steroid- free contest (the Natural Mr. America). =Criminal turned pastor= Enjoying a life of excess, he was drawn into organized crime. This involved him in one of the largest escort rings in California, as well as gambling, book making and other criminal pursuits. Eventually he was arrested and prosecuted. He boasted that he earned millions and loved life in the fast lane, including making $1000 a week from arm wrestling alone. His arrest in his Hollywood office was broadcast on live TV, shamed as a former Mr. Universe turned crook. His lawyer managed to reduce his sentence to just a year in prison for pandering. In prison he met a preacher who told him that God had big plans for him and that it was his destiny to become an international evangelist. He confesses to having been \\"struck by a lightning bolt from heaven and have his life flash before his eyes\\" after praying to God to pardon his sins and becoming a Christian. On being released from prison, he established the Dennis Tinerino Ministries based in Beverly Hills in 1979, becoming an international evangelist. In 2006 he authored the book Super Size Your Faith. Personal life Tinerino married Anita Conti in 1970. He developed cancer in the 1990s and was told he had 2 weeks to live but the cancer went into remission. He survived numerous near encounters with death, surviving a plane crash, car crashes and hitmen. He died of cancer in 2010. He is recognized in the AAU Hall of Fame, the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame, the Oldetime Barbell & Strongmen Hall of Fame, the National Fitness Hall of Fame, and entered the IFBB Hall of Fame in 2006.

He was born in Jalandhar, Punjab. In 1933 he wrote his second short story collection in Urdu called Aurat Ki Fitrat, the foreword of which was written by Munshi Premchand. Ashk began his literary career writing in Urdu but he switched to Hindi on the advice of Munshi Premchand. He joined All India Radio in 1941 where Krishan Chander, Patras Bokhari and Saadat Hasan Manto were among his colleagues. He settled in Allahabad in the late 1940s. He was the first Hindi dramatist to receive the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for playwriting in 1965.  Biography = Early life = Upendranath Ashk was born Upendranath Sharma to a Saraswat Brahmin family in Jalandhar, Panjab. Ashk began composing Panjabi couplets at the age of 11, and began writing in Urdu in 1926, under the tutelage of the Jalandhari poet Mohammad Ali \\"Azar\\". His first Urdu poem was published in the Sunday supplement of the popular Lahore-based Urdu daily Milap. In 1930, while still in college, he published his first collection of short stories, titled Nau Ratan. It was during this phase that he adopted the nom de plume 'Ashk' ('teardrop' in Urdu) in keeping with the Urdu tradition of taking a takhallus. The takhallus was chosen in honour of a childhood friend, whose death left a lasting impression on him. After graduating from college in 1931, Ashk taught at his alma mater for a few months before leaving for Lahore with the poet- journalist Mela Ram \\"Wafa\\". For the next three years he worked for Lala Lajpat Rai's newspaper Vande Mataram as a reporter, and then worked his way up as a translator and then assistant editor for the Daily Veer Bharat and the weekly Bhoochal. During this time he continued to publish poems and short stories in local journals. He also married his first wife, Sheela Devi, in 1932. In 1932, on the advice of the celebrated Hindi author Premchand with whom he maintained a correspondence, Ashk switched to writing in Hindi, painstakingly writing each story in Urdu first and then translating it into Hindi. His second collection of short stories, Aurat ki Fitrat, was published in Hindi in 1933, with an introduction by Premchand. In 1934, financial and other problems in his family made Ashk decide that he must adopt a more secure career path. He resolved to study for a law degree and become a sub-judge (magistrate). But just as he completed his degree, his wife, Sheela Devi, died from tuberculosis. In a state of profound grief, Ashk abandoned his plan to enter the legal profession and resolved to become a full-time independent author. At this juncture he also resolved to write realistically about suffering and poverty. In 1936, he published the short story \\"·∏åƒÅchƒ´\\" which was considered a milestone in progressive realism in Hindi-Urdu fiction. His son, Neelabh Ashk, was also a poet and translator. = Work for All India Radio = In 1941, after living for two years at the commune Preetnagar near Amritsar, where he edited the Hindi-Urdu journal Preet Lari, Ashk was hired at All India Radio (AIR) as a playwright and Hindi adviser. Other writers associated with AIR at that time included Sa'adat Hasan Manto, Khwaja Ahmad Abbas, Meeraji, Noon Meem Rashid, Krishan Chander and Rajinder Singh Bedi. Also living in Delhi at the time were Hindi authors Agyeya, Shivdan Singh Chauhan, Jainendra Kumar, Banarsi Das Chaturvedi, Vishnu Prabhakar and Girija Kumar Mathur. During this period, shk began work on his semi-autobiographical novel Girtƒ´ Dƒ´vƒÅr·∫Ω ('Falling Walls'). In 1941, Ashk separated from his second wife with whom he had had a short-lived marriage, and married Kaushalya Devi. = Work for Filmistan = In 1944, Ashk moved to Bombay to write dialogue and screenplays for the production company Filmistan. At Filmistan, Ashk worked closely with Shashdhar Mukherji and the director Nitin Bose. He wrote dialogues, stories and songs and even acted in two films: Mazdoor, directed by Nitin Bose, and Aath Din, directed by Ashok Kumar. While in Bombay, Ashk became involved with IPTA and wrote one of his most noted plays, T≈´fƒÅn se Pahale, which was produced for the stage by Balraj Sahni. The play, which was critical of communalism, was later banned by the British government. In 1946, Ashk contracted Tuberculosis and in early 1947, he was moved the Bel Air Sanatorium in Panchgani. Ashk remained in the sanatorium for two years, during which time Girtƒ´ Dƒ´vƒÅr·∫Ω was first published, in 1947, and he also composed his well-known poem \\"Barghad kƒ´ Be·π≠ƒ´\\". = Move to Allahabad = In 1948, Ashk and Hindi poet Nirala each received Rs. 5000 from the government of Uttar Pradesh to support them through illness. This enabled Ashk to move to Allahabad, where he lived until his death in 1996.

Like its predecessor, Becoming a Jackal (2010), the album has been nominated for the Mercury Prize. Background and recording During the writing and process for {Awayland}, primary songwriter Conor O'Brien was influenced by Radiohead, Aphex Twin, Tricky and Bj√∂rk, noting, \\"I bought my first synthesizer and learned how to use that and got a drum machine and a sampler and started making terrible techno music. Slowly words started appearing out of all these ambient soundscapes I was making and then I picked up the acoustic again and learnt how to finger pick properly. The whole album is really a by-product of that steep learning curve.\\" At one stage, O'Brien considered recording an instrumental album, inspired by electronica and Krautrock. O'Brien subsequently spent the next year recording rough demos for the album, before rehearsing them with the rest of the band: guitarist Tommy McLaughlin, pianist Cormac Curran, bass guitarist Daniel Snow, and drummer James Byrne. O'Brien noted, \\"After a year of working on my own, I spent four days kicking them around with the band, and it just became more visceral and groovier. I got rid of most of the electronic beds that I had made the song on. Stripping things back exposed the lyrics a bit more. Sometimes you can throw too much at something, and it just becomes weaker.\\" The band spent five weeks recording the album in Donegal, Ireland, at live-in studio, Attica Audio Recording. Writing and composition Comparing {Awayland} to the band's predominately acoustic debut album, Becoming a Jackal (2010), primary songwriter Conor O'Brien noted, \\"After two years of touring, I started feeling like the worst writer in the world. There wasn't enough depth to maintain my interest every night. There‚Äôs no way I can sing ‚ÄúMy love is selfish‚Äù a hundred time and it continue to feel pure and true. I felt, in a very childish way, I had romanticized sadness, and I was using the music to wallow. Even the acoustic guitar started sounding terrible to me.\\" O'Brien's initial demo recordings for the album ultimately differed from the final full band recordings. The track, \\"Passing a Message\\", was initially nine minutes long, with O'Brien describing it as \\"a big, ambient soundscape that peaked in the middle,\\" which was inspired by astronomer Carl Sagan's writings. The album's first single, \\"Nothing Arrived\\", was at first, \\"a pretty mental, drum and bass electronica [song], [with] lyrics about cities crumbling and people dying, sounds of fire and apocalyptic things.\\" After rehearsing the song with the rest of the band, the track became \\"a pretty straightforward folk rock song about smiling into the void.\\" Regarding his band mates contributions, O'Brien stated, \\"When I am on my own, it‚Äôs like an oil painting, I can put that on top of that and build up layers. But with the band, it turned out more watercolour, you‚Äôre leaving white bits of paper exposed, so that nothing is too overworked.\\" Critical reception The album received mostly positive reviews, and holds a Metacritic score of 80 out of 100, based on 27 reviews. AllMusic's Scott Kerr gave the album a positive review, praising the contributions of the full-band recording: \\"The songs feel fuller as a result, and without the burden of playing every instrument, the Irishman [Conor O'Brien] has concentrated his efforts into his lyrics. [...] The creative progression O'Brien exhibits here leaves no lingering questions of doubt whether he would succumb to the dreaded second album syndrome, and regardless of awards, {Awayland} sees the Irishman at his best, both musically and lyrically.\\" Writing for The Guardian, Dave Simpson issued the album with another positive review, stating: \\"The dazzling imagery comes with a rollercoasting voyage through acoustic soul, brass and ‚Äì a new development ‚Äì electronica. Drake's gentle, ghostly hand is most audible in the damaged beauty of the title track and depression-conquering \\"Rhythm Composer\\". The soaring \\"Waves\\" and joyful, piano-led Waterboysy stomp of \\"Nothing Arrived\\" may be the best Villagers tunes to date.\\" NMEs Lucy Jones gave the album a favourable review, paying praise to Conor O'Brien's vocals, stating that \\"O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs smiling-through-tears vocal that makes him sound like he‚Äôs going to explode with sorrow or joy at any minute is extraordinary.\\" Track listing All songs written by Conor O'Brien.

He is known for his work with symphonic orchestras in the United States, China, Germany and Austria, and for introducing modern American music to European audiences. For many years Sternberg served on the Board of Directors of the Conductors Guild and received the Guild's Award for Lifetime Service in 2009. Sternberg's performances are treasured by audiophiles and classical music enthusiasts all over the world. Early life Sternberg was born in New York to parents of Austrian and Russian descent. He studied at the Juilliard School, the Manhattan School of Music and New York University, obtaining a B.A. in musicology in 1939. He also attended the Graduate School of Arts and Science at NYU and Harvard from 1939 to 1940. After the war he spent time studying under L√©on Barzin and Pierre Monteux. Career Sternberg's conducting debut took place on December 7, 1941 at the helm of the National Youth Administration Symphony Orchestra. Shortly thereafter he entered military service in the US Army, and at the end of the war he became conductor of the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra. After returning to the US he traveled to Austria, where in 1947 he made his debut conducting the Vienna Symphony Orchestra. He was the conductor on the first recording by the pianist Alfred Brendel of Prokofiev's Fifth Concerto. Around this time Sternberg collaborated with H.C. Robbins Landon, assisting in the search for music manuscripts all over Europe. Robbins Landon later founded the Haydn Society, prompting Sternberg to produce a series of recordings of Haydn and Mozart pieces, including the Nelson Mass and Posthorn Serenade. After a year of conducting the Halifax Symphony Orchestra, Sternberg directed the Royal Flemish Opera for five years, subsequently returning to the US to become music director and conductor of the Harkness Ballet. He also served as musical director of the Atlanta Opera and Ballet, and accepted a visiting professorship of conducting at the Eastman School of Music, a position that he also later held at Temple University, where he remained for 20 years. He also served as a judge of conducting for The American Prize. Sternberg remained active throughout his life as a lecturer, conductor, and mentor. His wife, the English-German painter Ursula Sternberg-Hertz, died in 2000. A biography of Sternberg was later published by Tricorn Press (2014). In May 2018 Sternberg died of heart failure at the age of 98 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Jonathan Sternberg, American Conductor, Musical Director and Professor, Dies at 98 References Category:1919 births Category:2018 deaths Category:20th-century American conductors (music) Category:American male conductors (music) Category:Bach conductors Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Juilliard School alumni Category:Manhattan School of Music alumni Category:Music directors Category:Musicians from New York City Category:New York University alumni ","title":"Jonathan Sternberg"},{"id":"38228253","text":"Long Days of Vengeance ( is a 1967 Western film directed by Florestano Vancini.

It was built in ashlar in 1870 to a rambling plan in the Scots baronial style. Although roofs have fallen in the walls are sound and consist of two storey accommodation wings dominated by a four storey keep and a connected five storey tower. It stands in a 2000-acre moorland estate. History Kildalton was designed in 1867 by John Burnet and built by 1870 for the Islay distiller and MP John Ramsay. Ramsay had taken out a lease on the rundown Port Ellen distillery and made a success of it, improving Port Ellen's dock facilities and pioneering the export of whisky to America. The house he built stood in a moorland estate of 54,000 acres. Ramsay was a Deputy Lieutenant and a J.P. for Argyllshire and elected MP for Stirling Burghs in 1868 and Falkirk Burghs in 1874. He died in 1892 and the distillery continued under his wife and son, but in 1920 was sold to the Distillers Company. John Talbot Clifton's grave, Cnoc Rhaonastil, Islay Kildalton was sold in 1922 to John Talbot Clifton, a well-to-do landowner from Lytham, Lancashire who was passionately fond of shooting and foreign travel. He had travelled in Canada, Siberia, Burma, Malaya, Indonesia, Africa and South America, and was known for shooting wild animals and eating them. Some of the animals he shot were species new to science and were named after him, such as a type of wild Siberian sheep (Clifton's bighorn) and a Canadian marmot. He once dined on mammoth recovered frozen from the Arctic permafrost. He was married to the equally colourful Violet Beauclerk. His last venture was an expedition with his wife to Timbuktu, but he was taken ill en route and died in 1928 in the Canary Islands on the way home. His wife had his body embalmed and escorted it back to Scotland, where it was buried on Islay at Cnoc Rhaonastil. Violet then left the island to live at their Lytham house and Kildalton was neglected. Gradually the building deteriorated to the stage where floors and roofs collapsed, leaving only the shell standing. It was put on the Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland. The current owners of Kildalton are George and Fiona Middleton, who bought 2000 acres including the ruinous castle structure. Various attempts to achieve the renovation of the castle have failed.

Early life William Owen was born at 13 Broad Street, Ludlow, Shropshire in 1769 and was baptised on 3 November in Ludlow Parish Church. Owen's father, Jeremiah Owen, had trained for the church but instead chose to follow in his father's profession and took over the family barber shop which he later expanded into a stationary and bookshop. Owen found his talent at a young age, and would frequently be found sketching the scenery of his surrounding area, his first identifiable work being a drawing of Ludlow Castle, which is thought to have been given to Margaret Maskelyne, Lady Clive (1735-1817).The Annual Biography and Obituary, vol.X, 1826, p.359.  Career  In 1786 Owen moved to London, where he was apprenticed to the coach painter Charles Cotton, RA (1728‚Äì1798).This position was most likely arranged by his uncle, who was butler to the scholar and art theorist Richard Payne Knight, who lived near Ludlow. It appears that Owen was drawn to figure painting from the outset, and after copying a portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds of the much admired actress Mary Robinson (better known as 'Perdita'),Almost certainly the 'Portrait of Mrs Robinson copy from Joshua Reynolds', sold George Squibb Auctioneers, London, 2 July 1825, lot.118 he was sent on the recommendation of Reynolds to the Royal Academy Schools in 1791. Portrait of a man By 1794 Owen had moved out of his lodgings with Cotton on Gate Street and into a new to studio at No.211 Piccadilly where he remained for two years before moving to No.5 Coventry Street, Haymarket.The Royal Academy of Arts: A complete dictionary of contributors and their works from its foundation in 1769 to 1904 Vol.VI Oakes-Rymsdyck. London, Henry Graves & Co and George Bell & Sons, 1906, p.33 It is whilst living here that he presumably came into contact with future wife Lener Leaf, whose father worked in Haymarket as a shoe maker. By 1797 Owen was working as a studio assistant to John Hoppner, who by this point was struggling to keep up with the demand for copies of his portraits.The Farington Diary, Joseph Farington ed. James Greig, London, Hutchinson & Co, vol.1, p.210 Owen was clearly also experiencing some success in his own right, for in the same year he painted Lener, along with her younger sister, and exhibited the portrait at Somerset House ‚Äì the then location of Royal Academy exhibitions,no.13 ‚Äì Portrait of Two Ladies (The Two Misses Leafes) receiving a great deal of praise and encouragement.The Annual Biography and Obituary, vol.X, 1826, p.359 Owen married Lener later that year on 2 December and their son William was born soon after. In 1800 Owen and his family moved to Pimlico, although choosing to maintain his recently acquired studio at No.51 Leicester Square, next door to the house in which Sir Joshua Reynolds lived. This remained Owen's studio until he became too ill and moved out in 1818.The Royal Academy of Arts: A complete dictionary of contributors and their works from its foundation in 1769 to 1904 Vol.VI Oakes-Rymsdyck. London, Henry Graves & Co and George Bell & Sons, 1906, p.34 The year 1797/8 was perhaps the most significant in Owen's career as a painter; in 1797 he painted the then Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger which he exhibited the following year along with a portrait of the Lord Chancellor Alexander Wedderburn.  Royal appointment  In 1810 following the death of John Hoppner (1758‚Äì1810), Owen was appointed portrait painter to the Prince of Wales, later George IV (1762‚Äì1830). Unfortunately the prince never gave a sitting and instead Owen had to rely on a number of head sketches by his predecessor Hoppner to create a likeness. In 1813 Owen was offered a knighthood however he declined.  Decline in health  In 1818 Owen left his house in Pimlico and his studio in Leicester Square and moved to Bruton Street, most probably due to his slowly decreasing health, his eagerness however remained unscathed and he exhibited eight works at the Royal Academy the following year. In 1819 Owen travelled to Bath to meet a respectable man of medicine named Mr Hicks, however this seemed to have no positive effect and he soon returned to London. By 1820 Owen was confined to his bed where, with the exception of a brief six months spent in Chelsea towards the end of 1824, he remained until his death five years later.  Death  In 1825 Owen died after being accidentally poisoned by an overdose of 'Barclay's Drops' ‚Äì a mixture of aniseed, camphor and opium. Owen was very ill at the time, being confined to his bedroom and unable to move his limbs, relying on a draught medicine to aid his recovery. When the draught ran out his cook was sent to fetch another bottle, along with a bottle of Barclay's Drops, however the chemist labelled the two bottles wrongly and as a result Owen took a fatal dose of the opium-based medicine, dying hours later. At the inquest on 13 March 1825 the following verdict was reached by the jury: Owen was buried on 19 March 1825 at Saint Luke's, Chelsea,London Metropolitan Archives, Saint Luke, Chelsea, Grave Register, P74/LUK, Iten 282; Call Number: p74/luk/282 in a private ceremony attended by family and close friends, including Sir Thomas Lawrence, Sir Richard Westmacott, Thomas Phillips and 'Thompson' ‚Äì most probably Thomas Clement Thompson.The Annual Biography and Obituary, vol.X, 1826, p.366  References External links  Profile on Royal Academy of Arts Collections Category:1769 births Category:1825 deaths Category:18th-century English painters Category:English male painters Category:19th-century English painters Category:Royal Academicians ","title":"William Owen (painter)"},{"id":"38228310","text":"Tasil (, also spelled Tsil) is a town in southern Syria, administratively part of the Izra District of the Daraa Governorate. Nearby localities include Nawa to the northeast, Adwan and al-Shaykh Saad to the east, Jalin and Tafas to the south, Saham al-Jawlan to the southwest and Saida and the Golan Heights to the west. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics, Tasil had a population of 15,985 in the 2004 census. It is the administrative center of a nahiyah (\\"subdistrict\\") consisting of three localities with a combined population of 17,778 in 2004.General Census of Population and Housing 2004. Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). Daraa Governorate. It is situated on an elevation of 1,722 feet (525 meters) above sea level surrounded by extensive tracts of arable, but stony land.Schumacher, 1889, pp. 222-230. History Ancient remains in Tasil indicate that a temple dedicated to one of the Roman emperors Constantine the Great or Constantius II and dated to the early 4th-century CE was located in the village.Moralee, 2004, p. 35. Tasil might be the \\"Tharsila on the Batanea\\" listed by Eusebius as inhabited by Samaritans, though no other literary or archaeological evidence for a Samaritan past is known. Tasil played a role in a number of engagements between the Byzantine and Muslim Arab armies in the Hauran during the Muslim conquest of Syria in the early-mid 7th-century.O'Shea, 2007, pp. 39-42. In 1596, Tasil appeared in Ottoman tax registers as a village in the Nahiya of Jawlan Sargi in the Qada of Hawran. It had a population of 37 Muslim households and 25 bachelors. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 25% on wheat, barley, summer crops, goats or beehives, and a water mill; a total of 4,500 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 198 In the late 19th-century Tasil was a large village with about 90 houses constructed from stone and mud brick. The population was about 300, all Muslims. Its main source of water was natural pool, consisting of 50 square yards, called al-Birkeh (\\"the Pool\\") situated to the north. In dry seasons village residents had to travel to the Allan spring. Most of the archaeological fragments of Tasil were built into the village's houses and mosques, many of them hidden by the plaster. There was a local superstition among Tasil's inhabitants that any resident who removed and gave travelers stones from the village's structures would be punished by God either by death or another misfortune. Israeli paratroopers landed in Tasil on 10 June 1953 according to Syrian officials at the time.Mu ºassasat al-DirƒÅsƒÅt al-Filas·π≠ƒ´nƒ´yah. International Documents on Palestine. (1970).

During the Syrian Civil War, Tasil came under the influence of rebel Free Syrian Army forces. Later in the war, in February 2017, an isolated pocket of ISIL affiliated forces captured it from rebels during the Southwestern Daraa offensive (February 2017) On 27 July 2018, the Syrian army recaptured the town of Tasil from ISIL. Archaeology Two notable ancient structures were located in Tasil, near the residence of the sheikh (\\"local chief.\\") They stood adjacent to each other and were known as \\"Jama'ah\\" and \\"Medany.\\" The Jama'ah served as a mosque with an interior area of 53 x 40 feet and a roof supported by four square pillars. While the mosque appears to be of Islamic construction, it was possibly built on the site of an ancient synagogue or church. It had a courtyard to its east that measured 53 x 37 feet and was enclosed by basalt walls. In the southwestern corner of the mosque stood the ruined Medany tower which had a height of 20 feet and was supported by three columns. In the fields west of Tsil lay numerous dolmens, although most of them are collapsed or ruined.Schumacher et al., 1889, p. 151 ReferencesBibliography   External links * Map of the town, Google Maps *Boutmiye-map, 20K Category:Populated places in Izra' District Category:Towns in Syria ","title":"Tasil"},{"id":"38228359","text":"The gens Coponia was a plebeian family at Rome.

The species is known from Late Cretaceous sediments exposed in the state of New Mexico in the United States of America. It is one of several extinct species placed in the living golden-club genus Orontium. History and classification Orontium mackii has been identified from a series of three exposures in the Jose Creek member of the McRae Formation. These outcrops, near Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, are all from the same horizon of a volcanic ash fall and are separated by a distance of , preserving a warm to subtropical environment in and along a river system. The Jose Creek member is dated as probable Maastrichtian, based on the conformable contact between the Jose Creek member and the overlying Hall Creek member. In addition the site hosts a grouping of conifer megafossils which is comparable to that found in other southern and central North American fossil sites of Maastrichtian age. Of the three sites from which O. mackii is known, two preserve a typical wet environment which had standing water and wet soil conditions, as is seen in modern O. aquaticum habitats. The third site for O. mackii differs, being found in a paleo-flood plain, which was made up of well-drained soils and no obligate aquatic plants. If this is a correct interpretation, it has been suggested that, unlike the other two species in the genus, O. mackii was not dependent on wetland or aquatic conditions for survival. A living relative, O. aquaticum The species was described from a type specimen, the holotype TXSTATE-1001, and a group of five paratypes, all of which are currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections housed at the Texas State University, in San Marcos, Texas. The specimens were studied by a group of paleobotanists led by Josef Bogner, with the team publishing their 2007 type description for O. mackii in the Journal Zitteliana. The etymology of the chosen specific name mackii is in recognition of Gregory H. Mack, in honor of his longtime contributions to New Mexico geology, and for discovering the site which produced O. mackii. Description The leaves of O. mackii are an elliptical oblong shape overall, being over long, though the full length is unknown. The leaves range from in width, with a leaf petiole that is over long. The leaf tips are not known, due to the incomplete nature of the fossils found. As such, it is not certain whether O. mackii had leaf tips which were hooded in shape as are the leaves of both O. wolfei and O. aquaticum. The lateral veins of the leaves are composed of only two orders and are connected by a single order of crossveins while the midrib of the leaves is most distinct towards the leaf base. In the fossils the midrib is noted for a tendency to accumulate iron oxides.

October 2, 1998. Proposed convention center headquarters hotel=Consultant studies= Groundbreaking for the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in 1998 led many to conclude that a \\"convention headquarters hotel\\" was needed. With few hotels near the new convention center, the need for a \\"convention headquarters hotel\\" was seen as urgent early on. In May 1999, Monument Realty proposed constructing a 1,000-room convention headquarters hotel on a lot it owned on a roughly triangular parcel bounded by New York Avenue NW, K Street NW, and 10th Street NW.Haggerty, Maryann. \\"Land Gets New Lease on Life.\\" Washington Post. May 24, 1999. Monument estimated the hotel would cost $206 million. In order to make the venture profitable, the cost would need to be reduced to $169 million. Monument sought $57.3 million in tax increment financing (TIF) but never received approval from the city for the funds.Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"D.C. Weighs Convention Center Hotel Subsidy.\\" Washington Post. August 13, 2001. In late October 2000, Monument Realty sold the parcel for $43.2 million to Boston Properties.Cub√©, Christine. \\"Site Near Convention Center to Fetch $43M.\\" Washington Business Journal. October 23, 2000. Accessed 2013-01-03. (901 New York Avenue was built on the site.) In fall 1999, the Washington Renaissance Hotel at 9th and I Streets NW applied for $25 million in TIF money to expand into a convention headquarters hotel. But city officials turned down this request, saying there was significant risk it would not produce the tax revenue to make the TIF financially viable. D.C. Councilmember Jack Evans introduced legislation to award the TIF to the Washington Renaissance Hotel,Haggerty, Maryann. \\"A TIF Over Building Funds.\\" Washington Post. October 9, 1999. A TIF is a way of financing development. The government issues bonds whose interest and principal are paid by the tax revenues generated by the development. The money generated by the bond issue is given to the developer, who does not have to pay it back. The District of Columbia first authorized TIF in 2003. Up to $300 million in bonds could be issued, although each application must be approved by the chief financial officer, the mayor, and the council before bonds can be issued. but it did not pass and the hotel's owner sold the land on which the expansion would have occurred.The hotel would have expanded onto an empty lot on the northwest corner of 7th and I Streets NW. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Building was constructed on this quarter-block site in 2004. See: Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"D.C. Weighs Convention Center Hotel Subsidy.\\" Washington Post. August 13, 2001. To decide if a convention center headquarters hotel was economically feasible, two studies were conducted in 2000. First, the city commissioned a study by the Chicago firm of C.H. Johnson Consulting. Assuming a 71 percent occupancy rate and average room rate of $215 a night on 1,500 rooms, the Johnson study found the hotel would generate $135 million in gross revenues in its first year, resulting in a $34 million deficit. Nevertheless, the Johnson study called the convention headquarters hotel a \\"necessary ingredient\\", citing the size of the new convention center, the distance (nearly ) to the largest hotel, and the small size of nearby hotels. The Johnson study did not attempt to account for the economic impact of the hotel on other businesses in the city. Another study by PricewaterhouseCoopers, commissioned by the Washington Convention and Sports Authority (WCSA), found that in its fourth year of operation, the convention center would generate a demand for 55,500 more room nights than the city's existing hotels could accommodate. In time, PricewaterhouseCoopers concluded, the new convention center would generate demand for 500,000 room nights a year. However, the study also warned that any convention headquarters hotel would have to rely on non-convention meetings for a substantial portion of its business‚Äîputting it in competition with the smaller hotels in the city.Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"Convention Center Hotel Is a Gamble.\\" Washington Post. April 21, 2003. =Request for proposals for a new hotel= By November 2000, discussion by private developers and the city focused less on whether to build a convention headquarters hotel but how large it should be. The new hotel needed 1,200 to 1,500 rooms and at least of meeting room space. It also needed to be within walking distance of the new convention center. The city hired a consulting firm to determine if it would be financially viable to build a $400 million hotel on the following sites: the old convention center, along Massachusetts Avenue NW, or New York Avenue NW. Several large hotel operators expressed interest in building the new hotel, including the Hyatt and Marriott chains.Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"A Crunch Looms for Hotel Rooms In District.\\" Washington Post. November 27, 2000. However, no additional action was taken at that time. Six months later, in April 2001, D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams announced he was issuing a request for proposals (RFPs) to build a 1,100-room, $200-million convention headquarters hotel near the site of the old convention center. Williams asked private developers to propose privately owned sites for the hotel. If no privately owned site was available, Williams offered to build the hotel on the site of the old convention center (even though a consultant's report said that would limit the development potential of that site). Williams said a decision on a proposal would be made by the end of the year, and left open the possibility that the city would subsidize the hotel's financing. Real estate developer Kingdon Gould III said he was willing to build a hotel on an lot he owned at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue NW and 9th Street NW. Similarly, developer Douglas Jemal offered a site he owned at 7th Street NW and New York Avenue NW.Wilgoren, Debbi and Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"A D.C. Inner Harbor, Without Water.\\" Washington Post. April 13, 2001. Four proposals for the 1,000-plus room hotel (now priced at $300 million) were submitted by the August 2001 deadline. They included proposals by: * Hilton Hotels & Resorts, Douglas Jemal, and Landmark Organization Inc. (a development company based in Austin, Texas) for a hotel on the northeast corner of 7th Street NW and New York Avenue NW * Onyx International for a hotel on the north side of Massachusetts Avenue NW between 4th and 5th Streets NW * Monument Realty for a hotel on K Street NW between 4th and 5th Streets NW * Marriott International and Kingdon Gould III for a hotel along 9th Street NW between L Street NW and Massachusetts Avenue NW The city set a deadline of December 2001 for a decision on the proposals.Hedgpeth, Dana and Spinner, Jackie. \\"Bidders Vie to Build Hotel.\\" Washington Post. August 9, 2001. The award for the convention headquarters hotel went to Marriott International in October 2002. The September 11 attacks caused a severe economic downturn in Washington, D.C., which caused the city to delay its decision on the RFP for more than a year.Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"D.C. Delays Selection of Hotel Developer.\\" Washington Post. December 14, 2001. The award was not made until October 29, 2002. The mayor's office said the city would probably provide TIF financing to the project, which now was projected to have 1,500 rooms, of meeting room space, cost $500 million, and open in late 2006 or early 2007. The Marriott/Gould bid was chosen because the land parcel size, its location near the convention center, and the land, which was already owned by the partners. City officials said they intended to ask the Council for legislation to establish a nonprofit to sell TIF bonds and own the hotel. Marriott said it would buy $24 million of the bonds to create an ownership interest in the hotel, which it said would be built by The JBG Companies. To keep interest on the bonds reasonable, the city stated it would also seek authority to divert up to $19 million in general sales tax revenue in the event the hotel didn't generate enough revenue to pay interest on the TIF bonds.Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"D.C. Envisions Issuing Bonds to Fund Hotel.\\" Washington Post. October 30, 2002. =Initial financing proposal= D.C. Mayor Anthony Williams (pictured) began the process leading to the construction of the Washington Marriott Marquis by issuing an RFP in April 2001. The city's TIF financing proposal was controversial. Critics such as Charles W. McMillion (chief economist at the business consulting firm MBG Information Services) argued that the convention headquarters hotel would lead to lower sales tax revenue by reducing pressure on hotel room rates throughout the city and by keeping attendees away from local restaurants and retail businesses. The convention headquarters hotel, critics also noted, would not have enough attendance to make up the lost sales tax revenue. Executives at other hotel chains said the city's financing deal projected sales tax revenue of $40 million to $48 million a year, but a more reasonable estimate was $25 million to $30 million a year. City officials countered by pointing to the two studies conducted in 2000 which came to different conclusions, and by noting that the convention center had promised those booking large meetings at the site that a headquarters hotel would be open by 2007. Without the hotel, these groups could cancel completely, they said. On March 29, 2003, the $600 million Walter E. Washington Convention Center officially opened.Fernandez, Manny and Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"District Convenes Its Center Celebration.\\" Washington Post. March 30, 2003; Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"Builders of Conference Space Find Perfection Comes at a Price.\\" Washington Post. March 31, 2003. It took more than a year for the city to work out its TIF proposal. On December 16, 2003, the mayor's office finally asked the Council to establish a nonprofit entity authorized to issue tax-exempt bonds and borrow $1 billion. Under the plan, $460 million of the bond issue would go toward building the convention headquarters hotel. (The city said Tishman Urban Development Corp., not JBG Cos., would construct the hotel.) The remaining bond issue would refinance the convention center's existing debt to take advantage of much lower interest rates. The bundled debt issue, the mayor's office said, made the bond issue more attractive to investors because it was backed by revenues from two entities rather than one. To further ensure that the bonds were accepted by Wall Street, the city agreed to guarantee a portion of bonds' interest with general sales tax revenue in case the hotel TIF did not cover the interest.Irwin, Neil. \\"Mayor Wants D.C. to Build, Own Hotel.\\" Washington Post. December 17, 2003. Siting the hotel=The Mariani controversy= The mayor and city council were still negotiating over the TIF deal in March 2004, although both hoped to have legislation passed by May. Even as the Center for Exhibition Industry Research said a headquarters hotel was important for the success of the convention center, there was concern by other hotels in the city that the convention center had not generated enough room nights to justify its construction.Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"Meeting Expectations.\\" Washington Post. March 29, 2004. Washington Post business columnist Steven Pearlstein questioned in April 2004 if such a large hotel, questionably financed by the city, was really needed to make the convention center profitable. Pearlstein argued that two 500-room hotels, built solely with private financing, would be adequate.Pearlstein, Steven. \\"Hotel Plan Offers Right Questions, Wrong Answers.\\" Washington Post. April 23, 2004. D.C. City Council Chair Linda W. Cropp fought a year-long losing battle to put the convention headquarters hotel on the site of the old convention center. In April 2004, the D.C. City Council began debating whether the convention headquarters hotel should be built on the site of the old convention center. This proposal originated with local architect Ted Mariani, who proposed constructing a 1,500-room hotel with extensive meeting room space linked by a tunnel to the new convention center. Mariani convinced several members of the City Council that this would be the best use of the land.Hedgpeth, Dana and Irwin, Neil. \\"New Proposal Emerges for Old Convention Center.\\" Washington Post. April 8, 2004. (Pearlstein suggests that the council's action was also partly taken \\"out of pique at having been largely left out\\" of the previous year's negotiations.) The Williams administration strongly opposed Mariani's plan. Over the next month, members of the Williams administration and city council staff met to discuss Mariani's proposal.\\"Monday Morning.\\" Washington Post. May 17, 2004. Joe Sternlieb, head of the Downtown D.C. Business Improvement District; James A. Jemison, mayoral planning aide; and city development consultant Ron Kaplan met for two to three hours a day, three times a week, with council staff and offered to agree to a hotel and some meeting space so long as the council approved the deal by late June. But Council Chair Linda W. Cropp and Council Member Jack Evans (in whose ward the site was located) both favored the Mariani plan. On July 15, 2004, the two sides reached an agreement to proceed with the existing Williams plan.Irwin, Neil and Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"Library Wins in Current Site Plan.\\" Washington Post. July 16, 2004. However, some city council members and WCSA opposed the agreement. Going a step further, WCSA commissioned a study of the old convention center site from the consulting firm Conventions, Sports & Leisure International (CSIL). WCSA said the report would be ready in August 2004. =The WCSA report= The CSIL report was complete in October 2004. The authority was to vote to accept the consultant's report on October 13, 2004, but delayed the vote after Mayor Williams asked for more time to negotiate a solution.Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"Convention Center Board Delays Hotel Vote.\\" Washington Post. November 5, 2004. The next day, Cropp, supported by the city's hospitality industry, again suggested that the old convention center site be used for a $450 million, 1,500-room convention headquarters hotel.Pearlstein, Steven. \\"Waiting for a Middle-Ground Breaking.\\" Washington Post. October 15, 2004. With the two sides seemingly deadlocked, Greg Fazakerley, a local developer and former president of the D.C. Building Industry Association, stepped in at the end of October to assist the two sides in coming to an agreement. WCSA then scheduled a vote on the consultant's report for November 4.Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"Intermediary Seeks a Deal in Hotel Dispute.\\" Washington Post. November 1, 2004. WCSA again delayed its vote until December, but released CSIL's report on November 4 under pressure from the other parties in the dispute. The report analyzed six sites for the potential convention headquarters hotel as well as financing options. On December 3, the WCSA board voted in favor of the Williams site, but said it would continue to study placing a hotel somewhere on New York Avenue NW.Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"Convention Board Backs Mayor on Hotel Site.\\" Washington Post. December 3, 2004. WCSA said a third option would be to build the hotel on the northeast corner of the old convention center site. Cropp was unhappy with WCSA's action, and the city council continued to defer action on the TIF plan.McElhatton, Jim. \\"Mayor Ties Library, Development.\\" Washington Times. March 24, 2005. =Resolution on the siting issue= Resolution to the dispute came in June 2005, after more than a year's delay. By April 2005, a majority of the city council had come to support the Williams proposal, and the council planned to approve the Williams plan on May 4.Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"Bethesda Community Is Hot Property.\\" April 18, 2005. But Cropp convinced the council to put off the vote, arguing that the bill still gave the mayor absolute discretion over where to build a convention headquarters hotel.Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"D.C.

The agreement said that of land on the northeast corner of the old convention center site would remain undeveloped pending council resolution of what to do with the property. Under the plan, the council also retained authority to change the site of the convention headquarters hotel at any time. Obtaining more land=Purchase of the Pipefitters building= The Pipefitters headquarters, whose purchase by WCSA in August 2005 helped prevent another developer from owning land on the preferred site Further complicating matters was a $30 million bid in August 2005 by Philadelphia-based real estate development company Lubert-Adler Management to purchase a parcel of land on the corner of 9th Street NW and Massachusetts Avenue NW. This land was owned by a trade union, the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry (the Pipefitters), and the union's historic, 90-year-old headquarters occupied the site. Marriott, Gould, and the city hoped to convince the Pipefitters to sell their building for the hotel development. To prevent the Lubert-Adler purchase, WCSA placed a $900,000 deposit on the Pipefitters' property, and pledged that the historic building would be incorporated into the new hotel rather than demolished.Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"District, Developer May Be Competing for Property.\\" Washington Post. August 5, 2005. On August 22, the Pipefitters agreed to sell their parcel to WCSA for $30 million.Madigan, Sean. \\"Mayor Pitches Official Plan for Convention Hotel.\\" Washington Business Journal. February 27, 2006. This sale significantly strengthened the appeal of the Williams-preferred site. The convention headquarters hotel proposal received a major boost on September 11, 2005, when a second report by CSIL concluded that a $417 million, 1,200-room hotel with of meeting space and 600 parking spaces would be financially viable. CSIL said that a hotel constructed on the old convention center site would take 12 to 15 months longer to build and cost $12 million more.Irwin, Neil. \\"Consultants Endorse Convention Hotel Plan.\\" Washington Post. September 12, 2005. The report appeared to quash any further attempt to build on the old convention site. =The Gould land swap= The lot on the northeast corner of the old convention center, which Kingdon Gould III finally obtained in a land swap in November 2007 After council approval for Williams site, the city and Kingdon Gould III became locked in negotiations over Gould's land which would take nearly two years to resolve. The reason for the negotiations is not clear. Gould joined the original proposal by Marriott to build the hotel, and seemed willing to use his land for it. But at some point between October 2002 and January 2006, it became clear that private financing for the convention headquarters hotel could not be obtained with so many property owners.Hedgpeth, Dana and Lazo, Alejandro. \\"Convention Center Hotel in Jeopardy.\\" Washington Post. September 12, 2007. Gould was the smallest property holder and was not providing equity for the project, which led to negotiations to obtain his land. Initially, the city and Gould discussed two options: buying Gould's land outright, or permitting Gould to swap his land for city-owned land elsewhere. The two sides settled on a land swap, but negotiations stalled after Gould argued that his parcel (valued at $72.6 million) was more valuable than the city-owned parcel on the northeast corner of the old convention center site (valued at $75.9 million). Furthermore, Gould wanted zoning changes made to the old convention center site. City zoning laws required that 200 units of housing be built on the site. Gould wanted guarantees that he would receive a waiver for this regulation.Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"Gould Made Peace and a Deal for Hotel Site.\\" Washington Post. February 6, 2006.

The agreement also said, in part, that the city would seek changes to restrictive zoning regulations on the old convention center site.Local zoning regulations required that 200 units of housing by built on the old convention site. The letter of intent signed by the two sides also made one of Gould's companiesFor several decades, Gould was a partner in PMI Parking, one of the largest parking lot and parking garage companies in the D.C. metro area. manager of a parking garage at the new convention headquarters hotel and included late fee payments if the city did not act quickly to finalized the swap. Since the site preferred by Williams was not large enough for the planned hotel and the city-owned lots in the area not contiguous, Gould's land swap created a more unified site with fewer owners. By February 2007, the land swap agreement still had not been finalized. The zoning changes had not occurred, although city officials pledged they were coming. No agreement over parking garage management had been signed, either. The city declined to get involved in operation of the hotel, and advised Gould to negotiate with Marriott about parking garage management. The long negotiations triggered the late-fee clause that required the city to pay Gould $2.2 million. This, too, delayed the swap, since payment of fees greater than $1 million required city council approval. In September, Gould and the city public accused each other of stalling the deal. The Gould land swap deal was finally approved by the city council on November 1, 2007.Lazo, Alejandro. \\"D.C. Land Deal Clears Way For Convention Center Hotel.\\" Washington Post. November 2, 2007. It had taken 22 months to change local zoning regulations so Gould was exempted from building housing on the new site. =Miscellaneous other land parcels= The city had trouble obtaining title to other pieces of the hotel site as well. Two small parcels on 9th and L Streets NW still remained in their owners' hands in early 2007. Although the city could have used its eminent domain powers (approved in June 2006), it instead engaged in negotiations over the price of the land. These negotiations took nearly two years. It was not until December 2006 that the city used its eminent domain powers to secure the land.\\"D.C. Officials Plan to Acquire Site in Path of Downtown Hotel.\\" Washington Post. December 18, 2006. First financing package With council approval of the siting plan complete in June 2005, the council came under pressure to approve the financing package for the convention headquarters hotel. But with little movement on the issue, Marriott and RLJ Development (the development fund owned by billionaire cable executive hedge fund owner Robert L. Johnson) said on September 11, 2005, that they were working on a plan to privately finance the hotel and avoid the city council altogether. But no private financing fell into place, either. In February 2006, Mayor Williams resubmitted to the city council his three-year-old proposal for public financing the convention headquarters hotel. With the likely cost of the hotel now at $650 million, Williams asked the city to sell $187 million in TIF bonds to WCSA, which in turn would sell WCSA bonds based on its own revenues as well as those of the TIF. WCSA would use its own bond sales to pay $187 million of the hotel's construction costs, with the remainder to be privately financed by Marriott and RLJ Development. The Williams proposal also leased the publicly owned land to Marriott and its partners for 99 years at a cost of $37 million. The deal permitted Marriott to build a 1,434-room hotel with of meeting space and 600 parking spaces. Additionally, Marriott would permit WCSA to build a meeting center on the site. (WCSA said it would finance this center separately from the WCSA bond sale.) Although city chief financial officer Natwar Gandhi doubted the hotel would generate enough tax revenue to meet TIF needs, Marriott consultant MuniCap estimated the hotel would generate $44.2 million in tax revenue three years after its completion. To ensure that construction began by 2008, the legislation also contained eminent domain language allowing the city to obtain title to two small properties within the parcel which it had not yet acquired. Approval of this financing package was relatively swift. In June 2006, the council passed the Williams proposal. Only $135 million in TIF bonds were approved, but the eminent domain provisions were included as submitted.Hedgpeth, Dana and Kirkham, Chris. \\"Not Ready to Make Way for Marriott.\\" Washington Post. July 24, 2006. In November 2006, Adrian Fenty was elected mayor of Washington, D.C., after Anthony Williams declined to seek a third term in office. Fenty was sworn into office in January 2007. Second financing package and construction agreement=Financial viability and financing concerns= Concerns about the viability of the convention center headquarters hotel occurred again in 2007. Convention hotel room bookings in Washington, D.C., fell 13 percent in 2006 and were estimated to fall another 24 percent in 2007 and 29 percent in 2008, bringing into question the need for a headquarters hotel.Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"Convention Center Not Living Up to Lofty Goals.\\" Washington Post. February 19, 2007. In Baltimore, Maryland, a convention center headquarters hotel approved in 2006 failed to boost convention bookings. Furthermore, Gaylord Entertainment Company was constructing a 2,000-room hotel and meeting complex at its Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in Prince George's County, Maryland, just across the city line. The Gaylord complex, the Washington Post said, was likely to draw business away from the proposed D.C. convention headquarters hotel.Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"In Need of a Place to Stay.\\" Washington Post. February 19, 2007. Reviewing these developments, Heywood Sanders, a professor of public administration at the University of Texas at San Antonio concluded that \\"Putting in a hotel is no guarantee that it will improve the [Walter E. Washington Convention Center's] performance.\\" But others defended the need for a convention headquarters hotel. Convention center officials and William Hanbury, president and chief executive officer of Washington Convention & Tourism Corp. (a nonprofit group promoting conventions and tourism in the city), blamed the bookings drop on the lack of a headquarters hotel. Hanbury estimated the loss of convention business at $200 million. Additionally, the Washington Post reported that hotel occupancy in the city was still so high that few hotels were willing to give conventions the significant rate discounts they usually received. This, too, was hurting convention center bookings. Other issues threatened to raise the cost of the hotel and put its viability in question as well. A new sticking point was how many rooms the hotel would have to set aside each night for convention business. Marriott and its finance partners wanted fewer rooms dedicated to convention business so that its operating margins would be higher. Marriott also wanted to build multiple mid-size meeting rooms rather a few large ballrooms. No agreement had been reached on these issues by February 2007, despite several months of negotiations. However, the two sides did agree that the underground portion of the hotel would include a meeting center that would include at least one ballroom and multiple meeting rooms. The long negotiations were, according to RLJ Development executives, leading to higher costs and could lead Marriott and its partners to ask for more public money. The negotiations did not seem to impede construction, however. Construction on the hotel was scheduled to begin in early 2010 in time for a late 2011 opening. Despite questions about the need for the hotel, private financing fell into place by February 2007. Marriott and RLJ Development announced that Quadrangle Development Corporation was joining the project as a financing partner for the hotel, whose cost had fallen to $550 million. Even though the city had not issued any approval for alley closures, historic building preservation, excavations down to below ground, or zoning changes, the addition of private equity investment in the hotel was considered a positive sign. =Request for more public funds= D.C. Chief Financial Officer Natwar Gandhi warned that public funding for the hotel would breach the city's debt cap. He later helped negotiate the final financing package. Not only did existing finance deals fall apart in 2008, but costs on the project rose. As the developers asked for additional public financing, the city's debt cap began to play a role in negotiations. In February 2007, RLJ Development officials warned that the excessive delay in approving the project was leading to higher costs, and might lead Marriott and its partners to seek additional public funding. City CFO Natwar Gandhi warned in June 2007 that the project risked breaching the city's voluntary debt cap of 12 percent of total expenditures.Washington, D.C., had a legal debt limit of 17 percent of expenditures. To improve the city's dismal bond rating and low interest payments, the city adopted a voluntary debt cap of 12 percent.O'Connell, Jonathan. \\"CFO Reissues Debt Warning to Mayor, D.C. Council.\\" Washington Business Journal. July 10, 2008. Accessed 2013-01-12. On March 23, 2007, the Washington Post reported that the city would not offer Marriott additional tax increment financing for the project.Pearlstein, Steven. \\"It's Time for Subsidies to Subside in D.C.\\" Washington Post. March 23, 2007. Marriott asked for additional public financing in early September 2007. The cost of the facility had risen to $750 million, and a worsening economic climate made less credit available. Marriott and RLJ Development said that, without additional public funds, they would not turn a profit on the hotel. In response, council member Jack Evans (long a supporter of the hotel) suggested that the city cancel the project. A side-issue involved construction of the meeting center, agreed to in February 2006. At that time, Marriott agreed to let the city build this meeting center on part of Marriott-owned land just north of the convention headquarters hotel site. Marriott would build zoning-required housing on the rest of the land. But Marriott changed its mind, and asked the city to buy the parcel for $50 million. The city declined to do so, which put the February 2006 construction agreement in jeopardy. Even if the city did purchase the land, Marriott would be forced to lease it back for the convention headquarters hotel. The city said it would do so for $5 million a year, but Marriott balked and offered to pay $500,000 to $600,000 a year. =Final construction agreement= To save the project, Marriott agreed to scale back the size of the hotel. Shortly after the request for more public funding, District asked Marriott to cut the cost of the facility by reducing the number of rooms to about 1,000. Marriott agreed to build only 1,150 rooms, and to scrap the underground ballroom and meeting space (saving an estimated $100 million).Lazo, Alejandro and Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"Marriott Agrees to Smaller Hotel.\\" Washington Post. September 22, 2007. Marriott and the city also resolved their dispute over the room set-aside for convention business. This issue had been coming to a conclusion since early 2007, when Mayor Fenty gave Marriott a take-it-or-leave-it offer to reserve 80 percent of the rooms for the convention center, so long as convention center business was booked three years in advance. Marriott agreed to the 80 percent set-aside in September. The concessions by Marriott worked. On September 24, 2007, Marriott, WCSA, and the city signed an agreement to jointly finance the 1,150-room hotel.Schwartzman, Paul. \\"D.C. Convention Center's Hotel Set to Open in 2011.\\" Washington Post. September 25, 2007. Design work Marriott released details about the hotel's ongoing design effort in October 2008, more than a year after the structure's specifications had been agreed to by the city. The company said the convention headquarters hotel would break ground in 2009 and open in 2012. Marriott planned for the hotel to have six restaurants, five at street-level. These first floor restaurants would include a traditional restaurant, a \\"concept\\" restaurant, a cafe, a sports bar, and an upscale liquor bar. Marriott submitted its plans to the D.C. zoning commission for approval in November 2008.\\"Mixed-Use Project Awaits D.C. Approval, Crucial Financing.\\" Washington Post. November 24, 2008. The Marriott Marquis' design was submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission in late 2008. The designs outlined a 14-story, hotel with a glass and steel facade. The facade of the historic 1916 Pipefitters building would be incorporated into the facade. The design required digging below ground to build 1,000 parking spaces and two levels of usable space to accommodate of ballroom and meeting room space (which had been restored to the project). The plans also called for a tunnel beneath 9th Street NW to link the hotel and the convention center.Rein, Lisa. \\"D.C.

Third financing agreement=Collapse of private financing= As the recession deepened and the debt crisis worsened, the hotel's developers pleaded for yet more public funding. But in July 2008, city CFO Gandhi repeated his warning from June 2007 that the city would breach its debt cap by doing so. The city had already committed to public funding to redevelop the Southwest waterfront, the O Street Market mixed-use project, and the purchase of Skyland Shopping Center, and Gandhi warned that funding might need to be diverted from these and other projects or the city would be left with just $122 million to spend on development and infrastructure between 2008 and 2014. Marriott tried to calm the city's fears by saying it had not yet approached the capital markets to seek private financing, and would not do so until at least April 2009.Frederick, Missy. \\"Marriott International Not Worried About Financing.\\" Washington Business Journal. October 6, 2008. Accessed 2013-01-12. Private financing for the hotel collapsed in June 2009. RLJ Development dropped out of the project some time between September 2007 and June 2009, but Marriott added Capstone Development (led by a former Marriott executive) as a new financing partner. However, Marriott, Capstone, and Quadrangle Development were unable to find the funds needed to begin construction. In an attempt to rescue the project, on May 29, WCSA authorized the sale of $750 million in bonds to pay for the hotel. To issue these bonds, WCSA needed city council approval. But with the city facing an $800 million budget deficit in fiscal 2010 and a $1 billion deficit in 2011, such approval seemed unlikely.O'Connell, Jonathan. \\"Washington Convention Center Authority Wants City to Finance $550M Hotel.\\" Washington Business Journal.

June 19, 2009. =Third financing package= On June 17, 2009, the city council and WCSA came to an agreement on a new financing plan crafted by city CFO Natwar Gandhi. Under the plan, the city would loan Marriott $80 million in return for Marriott, Capstone, and Quadrangle raising their equity contribution to $320 million from $135 million. To obtain the additional equity money, ING Clarion Real Estate Investment was added as a new partner in the project.

The D.C. City Council voted unanimously on June 29, 2009, in favor of the new financing package. The deal was revised somewhat from the June 17 agreement. The city agreed to issue $225 million in bonds (down from $267 million) in order to give Marriott $159 million in equity financing (an increase from $135 million). TIF revenues from the hotel project itself would pay for $135 million in equity financing, while the other $24 million in equity money would come from other TIF revenue sources in the city.O'Connell, Jonathan. \\"D.C.

The JBG Cos. lawsuit=Initiation of the lawsuit= JBG Cos. allegedly sued to stop the Washington Marriott Marquis project in order to obtain favorable action by Marriott on condo conversions at the Marriott Wardman Park (pictured). Construction of the Marriott Marquis was placed on hold on September 4, 2009. A subsidiary of the JBG Cos., Wardman Investor LLC, filed a notice with the city's Contract Appeals Board in early 2009 to have the entire project set aside for being an \\"invalid sole source procurement\\". JBG Cos. argued that the original proposal required the hotel to be built on private land and financed with private money. JBG did not submit a proposal because it could not meet these conditions. Subsequently, the city negotiated only with Marriott, eliminated the private investment requirement, added $272 million in public financing, and gave Marriott an \\"extraordinarily favorable\\" lease. JBG argued that these changes so altered the terms of the project that it should be put out for public bid again. The appeals board said in July 2009 that JBG Cos. lacked standing to protest the award since it never bid on the job. Even if the company did have standing, the appeals board said, it lost the right to protest after the council passed legislation removing the project from the regular contracting process in 2006.Castro, Melissa. \\"JBG Sues D.C.

The JBG Cos. motive for filing the lawsuit may not have been to contest the construction of the convention headquarters hotel, however. The Washington Business Journal, quoting unnamed business sources, said that the lawsuit was really prompted by a dispute between JBG Cos. and Marriott over turning a portion of the Marriott Wardman Park (which JBG and another firm, CIM Group, purchased from Marriott in 2005) into condominiums.Marriott had sold the Marriott Wardman Park to JB Cos. and CIM, which allowed the two companies to turn a substantial number of the hotel's rooms into condominium. However, the deal included a clause that allowed Marriott to back out of the deal if revenues on the remaining hotel section, which Marriott now leased, fell below a specified number. When these hotel revenues declined significantly during the Great Recession, Marriott exercised its right to stop the condo conversions. JBG Cos. wanted Marriott to release the rooms.

History and development Event Cinema was set up at the start of the century with rock concerts by Bon Jovi (2001), David Bowie (2003), and Robbie Williams (2005) bringing non-film audiences into cinemas that had newly installed digital equipment. The Metropolitan Opera in New York through their partnership with Fathom Events is acknowledged as the trailblazer in this area, aggressively seeking out new markets and setting high standards for live broadcasts via satellite. Emulated by other opera houses worldwide such as the Royal Opera House following a close second, Glyndebourne, La Scala and the Sydney Opera House the genre of opera within the 'Event Cinema' industry has been a huge success, and has brought new, younger audiences into cash-strapped opera houses depended on state funding and wealthy benefactors for the first time - an unforeseen and happy consequence of digitisation. Ballet and theater have also been very successful, as have rock concerts, both live and recorded. The UK's National Theatre has been a huge success here with their season of live broadcasts under the banner 'NT Live', featuring big name casts such as Helen Mirren, whose recent turn as Queen Elizabeth II in The Audience was a sell out everywhere. (This was in partnership with another West End theatre and the NT are keen to help other theatres maximise their potential through live broadcasts). The Globe and the Royal Shakespeare Company are also producing work for live broadcast and recorded exhibition. As digitisation of cinemas matures, the Event Cinema industry is growing. The strongest territory is the US, followed by the UK and mainland European territories. Latin America is also a very strong market. Recent additions include Pompeii Live, a unique exhibition by the UK's British Museum, featuring celebrities and curators taking the audience on a live tour around the recreated set of Pompeii within the museum itself, and they are also exploring the schools market for the first time, following the live broadcast on June 18 with a daytime broadcast aimed at UK schools for the first time. If successful this will no doubt prove a model for future museums to emulate. Art galleries have also been a major player in the Event Cinema genre since the original EXHIBITION ON SCREEN title Leonardo Live in 2011. Such films combine gallery tours (sometimes but not always broadcast live) with a documentary-style exploration of the art and artist(s), and have featured leading institutions such as the Royal Academy of Arts, National Gallery, Mus√©e d'Orsay and Museum of Modern Art. An added incentive for exhibitors is the ability to show alternative content, i.e. alternative to mainstream, studio-driven content, such as live special events, sports, pre-show advertising and other digital or video content. In industry terms this has become known as 'Alternative Content', but has recently become known more widely as 'Event Cinema'. =Expanding markets= Some low-budget films that would normally not have a theatrical release because of distribution costs might be shown in smaller engagements than the typical large release studio pictures. The cost of duplicating a digital \\"print\\" is very low, so adding more theaters to a release has a small additional cost to the distributor. Movies that start with a small release could scale to a much larger release quickly if they were sufficiently successful, opening up the possibility that smaller movies could achieve box office success previously out of their reach.  Technical Specifications  Event Cinema is also finding a market in 3rd world countries in which the higher costs and quality of DCI equipment are not yet affordable, as crucially there are no DCI specifications for Alternative Content as there is in mainstream [studio] content. This has led to an explosion in the variety of content on offer, but lack of standardisation has led to questionable quality at times. As the industry matures, this lack of regulation is expected to change and there are moves afoot to introduce codes of practice and technical specifications. Recorded content complements mainstream studio content by maximising the 'downtime' that plagues the cinema industry, where screens worldwide spend a large proportion of their time in darkness and cinemas empty. Some cinema chains have targeted pensioners in particular, offering free tea and coffee for afternoon matinees of recorded opera, for example. DCPs have been useful to cinemas not yet equipped with satellite broadcasting capability and has enabled exhibitors to build their Event Cinema audience, which is not generally the 18-24 demographic that multiplexes are targeting.  New Audiences  Event Cinema has seen a return of an older, affluent audience, previously turned off by the multiplex experience, and cinemas are starting to capitalise on this by offering waiter-serviced, high class finger food and alcoholic beverages, complete with bars and restaurants, a world away from the traditional popcorn/soft drink model; art house cinemas are increasingly marketing themselves as 'destination' venues for an evening's entertainment, somewhere to spend an entire evening, rather than just a couple of hours. As exhibition admissions have plateau'd in recent years due to the explosion in VOD, tablet and mobile content technology, this new revenue stream has been a surprise and welcome addition to the cinema industry, though the US studios have been cautious in embracing the change as yet. The thrill of Live broadcasts means they are generally regarded as more popular than recorded events, but there are exceptions; artists with a loyal cult or teenage following tend to do particularly well in this area, as concert films featuring artists such as the Grateful Dead, Pearl Jam, JLS, Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones have shown.  The Future  As more and more distributors are emerging, offering an increasingly broad range of content to cinemas worldwide, the landscape itself is shifting: screen advertising companies, technical providers, and exhibitors themselves are reinventing themselves as Alternative Content or Event Cinema distributors, and the industry is witnessing a re-evaluation of business models and practices worldwide. Predictions are that this industry could be work in excess of US$1bn by 2015. An illustration of the growth of this industry is the news the establishment of a European trade association promoting the industry to the general public and supporting those involved in it and the Event Cinema Association.  Democratise DCP creation  With the digitization of the cinema content, Movie Theaters have taken upon themself to create their own DCP content, as free tools and services have made it accessible for all. Free software like DCP-o-matic or OpenDCP can convert from normal video format to DCI compliant DCP format, and services like Butler.film offers free cinema content related to event cinema.

In his only Manchester City appearance, he became the club's youngest ever goalscorer, a record he held until 2013. During the 1990s he played for a number of clubs in the lower divisions of the Football League, and made a total of 150 league appearances. Career Thompstone was born in Bury, Greater Manchester. He started his career with Manchester City, who in the 1980s had a strong reputation for youth development. He received a call-up to the first team for a match against Middlesbrough in April 1988, when several senior players were unavailable due to injury. Thompstone was named as a substitute. He replaced Trevor Morley in the second half, and scored with his second touch of the ball. The goal made him the youngest known goalscorer in club history, aged 17 years and 82 days. The record stood until January 2013, when it was broken by Marcos Lopes. As Lopes' goal came in an FA Cup match, Thompstone's goal remains a record for a Manchester City player in a Football League match. Despite his goalscoring debut, Thompstone never played for the club again. Thompstone was still eligible for youth team football in the 1988‚Äì89 season, despite having made his first team debut. Manchester City's youth team progressed to the final of the 1989 FA Youth Cup, where they faced Watford. Thompstone played both legs of the final. In the first leg, Thompstone redirected a Michael Hughes corner into the path of Mike Wallace, who scored the only goal of the game. However, Watford won the second leg 2‚Äì0 to win the cup. An ankle injury sidelined Thompstone for much of the following season. Manchester City offered him a short-term contract, but he opted to sign a longer deal at Oldham Athletic instead. Injury disrupted Thompstone's Oldham career, in which he failed to make a senior appearance. In the 1992 close season he moved to Exeter City on a free transfer. In one of his early games for the club he scored a hat-trick against Northampton Town. In early January his total for Halifax reached nine with two goals at Darlington, though those were his last for the club. On the March 1993 transfer deadline day he moved from Halifax to Scunthorpe for a ¬£15,000 fee. In October 1993 he scored in a 7‚Äì0 win for Scunthorpe against Northampton Town. Thompstone left Scunthorpe in the 1995 close season, and joined Rochdale. In total, he made 70 appearances for Scunthorpe, and scored nine goals. At Rochdale Thompstone played in an FA Cup tie against Liverpool at Anfield, though his team ended the match on the wrong side of a 7‚Äì0 scoreline. At the end of the season he again changed clubs, with a move to Scarborough. The Yorkshire club was where Thompstone made his final Football League appearances; he had a short spell at Bury in 1997 but did not play any first team matches. In April 1997 he moved from Bury to non-league Atherton LR. He proceeded to play for a number of non-league teams in North West England, including Flixton and Walshaw Sports. As of 2013, Thompstone was working as a financial advisor.

Man and Mountain: An Archaeological Overview of the Shenandoah National Park. Thesis U of Virginia, 1977. a group that also includes the Paine Run Rockshelter and the Blackrock Springs Site. Site 44-AU-154 lies on the southern side of Paine Run at the mouth of its hollow, on the edge of the national park and at the foot of the Blue Ridge, thus occupying a transition zone between the Shenandoah Valley and the mountain. It extends from the stream to the base of the mountain, approximately north to south, while east to west it is four times as long. At the time of its discovery, a Forest Service fire road bisected the site; the northern half was partially occupied by a privately owned house, while the southern half was part of the national park. Approximately east of the site is a rock outcrop with several rockshelters, including the significant Paine Run Rockshelter. Out of more than 2,000 artifacts discovered in a cursory excavation of the road and roadside sections of the site, more than 98% were locally obtainable jasper and quartzite. Some of the projectile points found at the site were characteristic of the Savannah River and Halifax cultures, allowing the site's occupation to be dated as occurring between 3000 and 1000 BC. During this time, the site is likely to have been used as a semipermanent base camp for Indians relying either on the mountain resources or the resources of the valley, whether for tool-manufacturing, processing hunted animals, or using plants found nearby. Because AU-154 bears evidence of a wider range of activities than do some of the smaller sites located higher up on Paine Run, it may have been a central point for activities occurring at the single-use higher camps. The site's archaeological value is so significant that it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in December 1985, together with the Paine Run shelter and the Blackrock Springs Site.

He previously played in the Brazilian Serie A for Atl√©tico Mineiro and Coritiba, in Serie B for Na√∫tico and Ponte Preta, in the Campeonato Paulista for Ponte Preta and XV de Piracicaba, in the Campeonato Potiguar for ABC Futebol Clube, in the Campeonato Goiano for Novo Hamburgo and on the Campeonato Paraibano for Treze. Career=Atl√©tico Mineiro= Bruno Fuso began his professional career at Atl√©tico Mineiro, where he had been part of the youth team. He made his league debut in August 2009 in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Palmeiras. He went on to play 7 league fixtures in the 2009 season, and made two appearances in the 2009 Copa Sudamericana. Loan spells In 2010, he was loaned to Oeste Futebol Clube to play Campeonato Paulista, but only made the substitute bench. For the second half of the year he was loaned to N√°utico to play 2010 Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie B. His debut came as a substitute on 1 June 2010 against S√£o Caetano, a game which ended in a 5‚Äì0 defeat. N√°utico were already 2‚Äì0 when he entered the field, after starting goalkeeper Rodrigo Carvalho was sent off. His first job was to face a penalty taken by Eduardo Pacheco. He went on to make a total of 10 league appearances for the club before the end of the season. =Ponte Preta= He was signed by Ponte Preta for the 2011 campaign, making his debut against Mirassol in a 2‚Äì1 2011 Campeonato Paulista defeat. He made 23 appearances in the Campeonato Paulista season, and one in 2011 Copa do Brasil, but only played once when the club competed in 2011 Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie B in the second half of the year. In the 2012 season he remained out of favour until late in the 2012 Campeonato Paulista campaign, making just four appearances. He also played three 2012 Copa do Brasil games. In the last of these, against S√£o Paulo, he made a bizarre error which cost his side a quarter-final place. Despite being contracted until the end of 2015, he was loaned to Coritiba the following month. Loan spells He made just one appearance for Coritiba in 2012 Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A, a 3‚Äì1 defeat to S√£o Paulo on 8 July 2012, however he signed a pre-contract to return for 2013 Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A. He returned to Ponte Preta, and accepted another loan in January 2013 to XV de Piracicaba for 2013 Campeonato Paulista in order to be closer to his family. He made 11 appearances and returned to Ponte Preta on 23 April, and then rejoined Coritiba on 21 May. He made no further appearances for Coritiba in this loan spell. In 2014 he was loaned on a full-year contract to ABC Futebol Clube. He played all 20 ties for the club in 2014 Campeonato Potiguar, but did not feature in the 2014 Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie B and returned to Ponte Preta in early November. He was loaned to Villa Nova-MG for the 2015 season, but made no appearances. =Novo Hamburgo= When his Ponte Preta contract ended, he signed with Novo Hamburgo to play 2016 Campeonato Ga√∫cho. He made 8 appearances, with his debut being against Ypiranga de Erechim, a 3‚Äì1 victory. =Treze= On 7 November 2016, he joined Treze to play 2017 Campeonato Paraibano.

One of several sites in the Big Meadows complex, Cliff Kill lies at the meadow's eastern side, immediately east of a 10-meter cliff; boulders mark the northern edge, and the headwaters of a small stream form the boundaries to the east and south. The surveyors test excavated the site, discovering that Cliff Kill yielded the fewest artifacts of any site so investigated (seventy-one, versus hundreds or thousands at other sites), and almost half of these items were broken pieces of stone tools whose original purpose could not be identified. Quartzite was the dominant material, being used for more than three-quarters of artifacts. Some pieces of projectile points were identifiable as to their cultural affiliation, including three dating from the middle to late Archaic period and one Woodland point, thousands of years newer than the other three. Given the paucity of artifacts, the appearance of flakes that had been reused for some purpose, and the total absence of evidence for on-site lithic reduction, the surveyors concluded that the site was periodically used as a specialty hunting camp, not as a base camp where daily tasks (such as repairing stone tools) would have been undertaken; if the site indeed were used as a buffalo jump, the animals would have been butchered at the cliff's base and the meat removed for consumption elsewhere.

The club was founded as a ski racing club and with the purpose of promoting downhill and slalom racing at a time when Alpine skiing competitions were not recognised internationally. The Kandahar Ski Club takes its name from the Roberts of Kandahar Challenge Cup; the first ski race held was in 1911 over the Plaine Morte Glacier in Crans-Montana,Chamonix World Cup \\"History\\" Switzerland for a trophy donated by Field Marshal Earl Roberts of Kandahar.Roberts took his title from the relief of Kandahar in the Second Anglo‚ÄìAfghan War. The winner was Cecil Hopkinson. History The first Winter Olympic Games also took place in 1924 as did the foundation of the FIS. There were only Nordic events at these games and the FIS was concerned only with these. The club's aim was to ensure that the Alpine disciplines were included in the future. In the same year the club issued a challenge to the British skiers in Wengen across the valley. The competition was for a slalom and a downhill race, which was won by the Kandahar. The skiers from Wengen went on to form the Downhill Only Ski Club (DHO). Swiss skiers also shared the objectives of the Kandahar. In M√ºrren were brothers Walter and Max Amstutz, both of whom were keen downhill skiers and were friends with the British. Walter Amstutz founded the Schweizerischen Akademischen Skiklub in November 1924. By 1927 the club had attracted over 200 members, but Alpine skiing still was not recognised by the various National Ski associations, although at university level, international competitions were being held between the Swiss, Germans, Austrians and British. The first Inferno Race took place in January 1928 when 19 members of Kandahar Ski Club climbed the Schilthorn (2,970m) above M√ºrren to race down the 2,100 metres to Lauterbrunnen, 14 kilometres away. The FIS finally admitted the Alpine events to its programme in 1930 and in 1931 the FIS held their Alpine Championship in M√ºrren. It was organised by the British. At the end of the 1930s, the objectives of the club had been achieved - downhill and slalom racing were internationally accepted under the rules that they had helped develop. The club had over 600 members. M√ºrren The Kandahar Ski Club has its clubhouse in M√ºrren, where the Scaramanga Roped Race is organised by the club around New Years Day each year. Inferno Race The International Inferno Race takes place in M√ºrren at the end of January each year with over 100 club members taking part. The race is now organised by the Skiclub M√ºrren, attracting more than 1,700 competitors from 25 countrieshttps://www.inferno- muerren.ch/en/archives/statistics/participating-nations Race Training The Kandahar Ski Club organises Junior Race Training to support British ski racing.

It was commissioned for St Matthew's Church, Northampton and first performed on 21 September 1946, St Matthew's Day, three days after its composition. It uses a theme from a motet by the Spanish composer Vittoria, both in the prelude (where it is played repeatedly on the pedals) and as the basis for the fugue. The piece, which lasts about five minutes in performance, has had a mixed reception. One writer has noted the difficulty on finding a suitable organ on which to perform the piece, given the difficulties in finding appropriate registration to meet Britten's requirements. A reviewer of a concert performance in the 1960s called it \\"a contrived attempt to make bricks without straw\\", although other commentators have been more favourable about the piece. Background The English composer Benjamin Britten was asked to write the Prelude and Fugue for St Matthew's Church, Northampton. It was first performed there on St Matthew's Day (21 September) 1946, three days after it was composed. There is a story that he wrote it in bed one morning before breakfast. Britten had previously been commissioned by the vicar of St Matthew's, Walter Hussey, to write a cantata, Rejoice in the Lamb, for the church's fiftieth anniversary in 1943; the organ accompaniment for the cantata used the organ in a \\"strikingly original way\\". The Prelude and Fugue was one of two pieces based on themes by other composers that Britten wrote in 1946; the other was the Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra, which was based on a piece by Henry Purcell. Structure Tom√°s Luis de Victoria, composer of the theme upon which the piece is based Both sections of the piece are based on a theme from a motet, Ecce sacerdos magnus (\\"Behold a great priest\\"), by the Spanish composer Tom√°s Luis de Victoria (or \\"Vittoria\\", 1548‚Äì1611). The theme, which comes from a plainchant melody used in Vittoria's day on the feast day of a saint and bishop, is nine notes long and does not range widely. The Prelude, which is in time (four minims to a bar), opens with a statement of the theme played on the pedals in quintuplets (five quavers played in the time of four), marked ff, (fortissimo, \\"very loud\\"). The theme is repeated frequently in the pedals during the prelude, which is marked \\"largamente\\" (\\"broadly\\"). The prelude, which takes about one and a half minutes in performance, is thirteen bars long. Vittoria's theme is also used (with little development) as the subject of the fugue. This section is in time (three crochets to a bar) and is marked \\"Andante con moto\\" (\\"at a walking pace, with movement\\"). The fugue, which is mainly in four-part writing with frequent rhythmic changes, gradually builds to a climax. In bar 69, a new louder melody is added in the right hand against the fugue theme in the pedals. Gradually, the piece dies away to two parts and ppp (pianississimo, \\"very, very quietly\\") as the left and right hands play the fugue theme a bar apart from each other, in canon. The whole piece lasts about five minutes. Assessment The piece has had a mixed reception. Even one of its supporters says that \\"players do not seem to like it much\\", despite it being written so that \\"the average parish organist might have a fair chance to play it.\\" The American musician Luther Noss reviewed the piece upon its publication by Boosey & Hawkes in 1952, stating that it was \\"well written for the organ\\" and \\"remarkably free\\" of some of the problems found in other modern organ music. He thought that it gave the impression of having been written with the organ in mind rather adapted from a piece intended for another instrument, unlike some other contemporary organ works. However, he commented that the theme provided little melodic or rhythmic interest and Britten used it, he thought, \\"not without a suggestion of monotony.\\" Although the theme is \\"not the stuff of which great music is made\\", Noss remarked on the \\"exciting\\" pedal flourish at the opening of the piece, the attractive use of melody and harmony, and \\"grand crescendos and lingering diminuendos\\" to keep the listener interested. Another early reviewer described it as \\"spacious\\", with a \\"by no means academic\\" fugue and a style that \\"suggests a modern romantic composer's appreciation of the more austere aspects of the classical organ school.\\" The review also noted that many of the accents marked in the piece \\"seem incapable of realization by any of the usual methods of suggesting accentuation of the organ.\\" It was included in a concert at St Clement Danes, London, in November 1963 that honoured Britten's fiftieth birthday with performances of some of his lesser-known works. The review in The Times remarked favourably on the Te Deum in C and the Six Metamorphoses after Ovid for solo oboe. Of the organ piece, though, the critic said that it was \\"a contrived attempt to make bricks without straw.\\" The organist Alan Harverson describes it as \\"excellent\\" and notes its \\"orthodox layout and textures\\", in comparison to the organ writing of Rejoice in the Lamb and the Festival Te Deum (1944). He regards the Prelude as \\"concise and majestic\\" and describes the ending as \\"touchingly serene\\" with a \\"charming canon\\". The musicologist and Britten expert Philip Brett describes the piece (without naming it) in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians as a \\"slight organ work\\". The organist Timothy Bond disagrees with the piece's \\"bad press\\" and the \\"dismissive\\" comments made about it by Brett and others. According to Bond, this \\"fresh and vital\\" work is \\"a finer, more accomplished piece than it sometimes sounds in performance.\\" He notes the difficulty of finding the best registration ‚Äì no registration suggestions are given ‚Äì and the best organ to perform the piece on, since it seems to require steady and considerable changes in volume without changes in the tone quality produced by the organ yet also demands neoclassical \\"brightness and clarity\\", a combination of requirements that it is difficult for organs to meet. On the right organ, however, Bond says that the piece can sound \\"particularly striking\\" and \\"harmonically bold and telling, if occasionally gauche\\", as it moves through passages that are \\"serene\\", \\"creepy\\", \\"vigorous\\", \\"nostalgic\\" and finally \\"serene\\", albeit with a \\"rather pedestrian\\" cadence.

Recorded during the early 1970s as part of a comprehensive survey of the national park, the Gentle Site is distinctive because of the lithic cores that it yielded, many of which were tiny articles of cryptocrystalline smaller than cores from any other site noted by the survey. Shallower than many of the other sites, just deep versus the 20 cm or deeper of other survey-recorded sites, it was nevertheless one of the survey's largest sites, yielding more than five thousand artifacts over a surface area of approximately . The site lies near the Big Meadows complex of sites at the headwaters of the Rose River, at the confluence of the juvenile river with a small tributary, Hogcamp Branch; its elevation is approximately , but it sits just below the saddle of Fisher's Gap at an elevation of more than . Its location along the river, near a set of pools and waterfalls, suggest that it might have been used for catching fish such as the brook trout. Previous surveys had recorded the site, due to the numerous artifacts exposed in the surrounding terrain. The 1970s survey recorded early and late dates from a collection of projectile points found beneath the footpath that traverses the site; most were of a form found in Woodland-period sites postdating AD 1300, while the site also yielded a smaller collection resembling points from Early Archaic sites predating 4500 BC. A small collection of pottery, approximately 25 sherds, also was discovered; most of the pieces were of a form known as the Albemarle series. Overall, the stone artifacts found at Gentle were predominately quartzite, with cryptocrystalline and quartz representing most of the remainder. Most of these artifacts were tiny lithic flakes, many so small that they presumably could have been created only by the resharpening of existing blades made elsewhere, although the site also yielded two scrapers, a chopper that had been used as a basic millstone, and a hand drill. The period between occupations, with thousands of years separating the earlier Archaic occupiers and the later Woodland tribesmen, is typical of major Virginia sites discovered in the 1970s, at which time there was a significant gap in the knowledge of the ancient hillmen living within the future state's borders. The presence of cryptocrystalline found in the Shenandoah Valley but not in the immediate vicinity of the site, together with numerous projectile points, prompted the surveyors to interpret it as a base camp for hunting and gathering in the mountains; apparently by Valley villagers who would have visited it during the summer and autumn. In 1985, Gentle was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its archaeological value.

Man and Mountain: An Archaeological Overview of the Shenandoah National Park. Thesis U of Virginia, 1977. a group that also includes archaeological site 44-AU-154 and the Blackrock Springs Site. Located in a mountainside hollow, near three other rockshelters, the site is deeply stratified. It is a small shelter, only about in area, and little taller than the average man. The shelter faces northward, toward the narrow floodplain and Paine Run, which flows approximately away; it sits just east of site 44-AU-154. While other archaeological sites in Paine Run Hollow date primarily from the Archaic period, the rockshelter appears to have been occupied at a period of culture change, as the inhabitants were in the process of transitioning from the use of quartzite to cryptocrystalline for their stone tools. Evidence of occupation persists as late as the fourteenth century AD. The site's two components yielded eight hundred and fifteen hundred separate artifacts in total; its artifactual density was the highest of any site recorded by the survey, prompting its interpretation as a regional base camp used frequently by larger groups of people. The surveyors readily conducted a test excavation after finding many lithic flakes, pieces of pottery, and projectile points on the surface. The ceramics are dominated by a form known as \\"Albemarle cord-marked\\", which represents nearly two-thirds of potsherds found in the shelter. Meanwhile, the shapes of the surviving lithic flakes (small pieces with almost no cores) appears to indicate that toolmaking done in the shelter consisted of refining rough work that had been performed elsewhere. The site's archaeological value is so significant that it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in December 1985, together with 44-AU-154 and the Blackrock Springs Site.

It is his second depiction, after Circe Offering the Cup to Ulysses (1891), of the classical mythological character Circe. This particular mythological portrayal is based on Ovid's tale in Metamorphoses, wherein Circe turns Scylla into a sea monster, solely because Glaucus scorned the enchantress' romantic advances in hopes of attaining Scylla's love instead. Waterhouse later returned to the subject of Circe a third time with The Sorceress (1911). Circe Invidiosa is part of the collection of the Art Gallery of South Australia, which also owns Waterhouse's The Favourites of the Emperor Honorius.Art Gallery of South Australia: Collection  Description  The myth of Circe, Glaucus, and Scylla originates in Book XIV of Metamorphoses. The specific scene that Waterhouse bases this painting on occurs in lines 52‚Äì65 of the epic poem: > There was a cove, a little inlet shaped like a bent bow, a quiet place where > Scylla, at midday, sought shelter when the sea and sky were hot; and, in > midcourse, the sun scorched with full force, reducing shadows to a narrow > thread. And Circe now contaminates this bay, polluting it with noxious > poisons; there she scatters venom drawn from dreadful roots and, three- > times-nine times, murmurs an obscure and tangled maze of words, a labyrinth‚Äî > the magic chant that issues from her lips. Then Scylla comes; no sooner has > she plunged waist-deep into the water than she sees, around her hips, the > horrid barking shapes.Mandelbaum, Allen. 1995. The Metamorphoses of Ovid. > Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Lines 52-65, page 475 Waterhouse's version similarly shows Circe floating over the water in the cove, pouring bright green poison into the pool below. Under her feet, Scylla's \\"barking shapes\\" already swirl in the bubbling depths below; the transformation is well underway. Neither Scylla's human form nor her monster form is the emphasis here. Rather, the power of Circe's grave face and tangible jealousy rules this scene, as the vivid colors swirl all around her figure.  Analysis  While this painting is an homage to Ovid, Waterhouse spins the classical in imaginative and poetic ways. Anthony Hobson describes the painting as being \\"invested with an aura of menace, which has much to do with the powerful colour scheme of deep greens and blues [Waterhouse] employed so well.\\"Hobson, Anthony. 1989. J. W. Waterhouse. Oxford: Phaidon Christie's. pages 48-49, 52. Those colors are \\"near stained glass or jewels,\\" according to Gleeson White.White, Gleeson. 1909. The Master Painters of Britain. International Studio. page 318. Judith Yarnall also echoes the sentiment about the colors and mentions an \\"integrity of line\\" in the painting. She says that taken as a pair, Waterhouse's first two Circes prompt the question: \\"is she goddess or woman?\\"Yarnall, Judith. 1994. Transformations of Circe: The History of an Enchantress. University of Illinois Press. page 166 Circe Invidiosa exemplifies Waterhouse's experimentation with the femme fatale archetype, which pervaded an immense amount of late nineteenth-century art. However, Chris Woods argues that Waterhouse's portrayals of Circe are not wholly evil, destructive, or monstrous, much like one sees in paintings of female mythological figures by Gustave Moreau or other European Symbolists. In this painting, Circe becomes a tragic figure: she \\"cannot help what [she is] doing, and rather regret[s] it.\\" Woods, Christopher. 1981. The Pre-Raphaelites. The Viking Press. page 144.

Plot  Future Ted explains to his kids that, while he had previously claimed to be ready to stop dating and settle down with one woman, he enjoyed being single and dating different women. However, his relationship with Jeanette, the last woman he dated before meeting their mother, would be what made him decide to settle down, especially after an incident where she destroyed his apartment in a fiery wreckage. The story flashes back several weeks earlier, as Marshall and Barney use Ted's apartment to store some things Lily and Robin will not let them keep. The three men discuss Jeanette's psychotic behavior, including destroying his television with a beer bottle. Ted decides he has to break up with her, and plans to do so at the Barclays Center ‚Äì even after discovering that being in a public place does not deter Jeanette from violence. Ted reports to Marshall and Barney that they were both kicked out of the venue, and asks them not to let her into the apartment. Robin's aversion to holding babies continues to assert itself; she has never held Marvin in the eight months since he was born. When Lily leaves Marvin's favorite pacifier on a city bus, she asks Robin to watch Marvin as she chases down the bus. In Lily's absence, Robin tries to rock a crying baby Marvin by lifting the stroller. An old woman comes by and helps her comfort the baby. However, as Robin and the old woman talk, the stroller with baby Marvin on it rolls into the street. Noticing that Robin is shaking from the cold after safely retrieving the stroller, the old woman accompanies them to the Lusty Leopard and Robin leaves Marvin in the woman's care while going to the bathroom. Robin returns with Marvin to the same spot before Lily comes back with the pacifier, and initially claims nothing unusual happened. However, flashforwards show that Robin gradually confesses everything during wine-drinking sessions with Lily over the years, with Lily getting progressively angrier at Robin's irresponsibility ‚Äì until Robin admits that the \\"old woman\\" was Mike Tyson, who is a senator in 2030. Marshall and Barney later admit Jeanette to Ted's apartment, where she barricades herself into his bedroom and begins destroying his belongings. Ted calls the police, but realizes she is a police officer after hearing Jeanette respond to the police dispatcher. He arms himself in a comical manner to confront her but still fails to eject her. Robin and Lily have since arrived at Ted's apartment, and Robin, recalling Tyson saying that when a woman seems crazy, her boyfriend is often at least as crazy, questions if Ted's own behavior and mixed signals have led to Jeanette's craziness. He admits that he made out with her at Barclays Center (their escalating intimacy being the reason they were thrown out) and just before in his room. Lily advises him to continue seeing Jeanette for the time being, since he is slightly unstable as well and needs to get it out of his system. During the conversation, Robin is shocked and excited to realize she is holding Marvin. Late at night, Robin is in a rocking chair and still holding Marvin. She tells Lily she is happy to continue doing so rather than put him in his crib, but immediately after Lily leaves Robin is dismayed to realize that Marvin has soiled his diaper and calls Lily back into the room. Critical reception Donna Bowman of the A.V. Club gave the episode a C. TV.com's Bill Kuchman said the episode seemed designed around the possibility of the show's renewal, especially given the numerous episodes in recent weeks. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly stated that the episode gave Ted lessons about commitment. She added that the writers found a way to place Tyson's appearance into the story.

Early life Mazzocchi attended the University of Pittsburgh, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in life sciences and biochemistry. He then completed graduate studies in biophysics at UCLA. Entrepreneurship Mazzocchi's first medical start-up was the firm Microvena, a producer of medical devices he founded in 1989 as a co-venture with Phillips Plastics. Soon after its founding Microvena began operating independently of Phillips, and within four years had over seven million dollars in annual sales. In 1997 groundwork for a potential Microvena IPO led Piper Jaffray to determine that the value of Microvena was between $170 million to $185 million. That year Mazzocchi received the inaugural \\"technology leader\\" award from Minnesota Technology Inc. Mazzocchi remained CEO until 1998, after which Mazzocchi joined a lawsuit launched by minority shareholders against the majority owners for opting against company expansion and growth into new areas. After leaving Microvena Mazzocchi co-founded the medical company Vascular Science, Inc, where he served on the board of directors. In 1999 the company was sold to St. Jude Medical, in a deal worth $100 million (including $20 million in milestone payments).

In 2008 Mazzocchi became CEO of NovaVision. Then in 2010 he was named CEO of Elenza. The company is developing the first auto-focusing intraocular lens replacements for people with cataracts and presbyopia. As of 2015, Elenza was in litigation proceedings against Novartis in relation to its technologies. He was also on the Board of Directors of Greatbatch, serving on the Technology Development and Innovation and Corporate Governance and Nominating committees, and has served as a Director of NexGen Medical Systems. Books Mazzocchi published the novel Equity of Evil, a medical thriller based on true events. The book drew off Mazzocchi's experience in medical venture capitalism and was awarded the Global eBook Award for best suspense novel and an eLit award for best suspense/thriller novel. In a 2012 interview with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Mazzocchi wrote of the prologue that it \\"is actually a snap-shot of my work experience in a human genetics lab during my college years as a pre-med student. We were forbidden from discussing what happened there behind those closed doors and it took nearly 30 years for me to eventually 'tell the story'\\". The book itself is about a new method of abortion that resulted in the pirating of intact human fetuses that became a supply of harvested organs that were grown like hydroponic vegetables to supply the multi-billion dollar black market of human organ transplants. Mazzochi's follow-up novel Equity of Fear was released in 2013 by Twilight Times Books. Broadway World Books stated that Equity of Fear offered \\"the same suspense, intensity and international intrigue\\" as the first installment of the series. In late 2013, Mazzocchi then released his first non-fiction book STORYTELLING - The Indispensable Art of Entrepreneurism, also published by Twilight Times Books. Patents Mazzocchi has authored more than 70 patents, including patents in the fields of cardiology, oncology, orthopedics, neurosurgery, ophthalmology and embryonic stem-cell development. For a few brief examples, in 2001 Mazzocchi was a part of the team that patented a new medical grafting apparatus, granted to St. Jude Medical. In 2003 Mazzocchi authored a patent for a method and apparatus for occluding aneurysms, assigned to AGA Medical Corporation. In 2010 he authored patents for a fiducial marker devices, tools, and methods (awarded to Medtronic, Inc.) and a method and device for filtering body fluid (awarded to ev3 Inc). In 2011 Mazzocchi was named as one of the three inventors of a trajectory guide with angled/patterned guide lumens, given to the University of South Florida. Awards Mazzocchi was the recipient of the 2004 Ernst & Young annual Entrepreneur of the Year Award, and received the 2013 Global Entrepreneur of the Year Award by the Business International Group.

Rebuilt several times in its history, the castle was originally built in the 14th‚Äì15th century by a wealthy noble family.\\"Podzamcze ‚Äì Ogrodzieniec Castle\\", Castles in Poland The castle is situated on the 515.5-metre-high Castle Mountain (Polish: G√≥ra Zamkowa), the highest hill of the Krak√≥w-Czƒôstochowa Upland. Located on the Trail of the Eagles' Nests, the ruins are open to visitors.  History  Established in the early 12th century, during the reign of Boleslaus III Wrymouth, the first stronghold was razed by the Tatars in 1241. In the mid-14th century a new gothic castle was built here to accommodate the W≈Çodek Sulima family. Surrounded by three high rocks, the castle was well integrated into the area. The defensive walls were built to close the circuit formed by the rocks, and a narrow opening between two of the rocks served as an entrance. In 1470, the castle and lands were bought by the wealthy Cracovian townsmen, Ibram and Piotr Salomon. Then, Ogrodzieniec became the property of Jan Feliks Rzeszowski, the rector of Przemy≈õl and the canon of Krak√≥w. Around 1488, the castle was owned by Jan and subsequently Andrzej Rzeszowski and, later, the Pilecki and Che≈Çmi≈Ñski families. In 1523 the castle was bought by Jan Boner. After his death, the castle passed to his nephew, Seweryn Boner, who replaced the medieval stronghold with a renaissance castle in 1530‚Äì1545. In 1562, the castle became the property of the Great Marshal of the Crown Jan Firlej, as a result of his marriage to Zofia, the daughter of Seweryn Boner. In 1587, the castle was captured by the Austrian archduke Maximilian III, the rejected candidate to the Polish-Lithuanian throne. In 1655, it was partly burnt by the Swedish troops, who ‚Äì deployed there for almost two years ‚Äì damaged the buildings considerably. From 1669 on, the castle belonged to Stanis≈Çaw Warszycki, the Krak√≥w's castellan, who managed to partly rebuild the castle after the Swedish devastations. About 1695, the castle changed hands once again, becoming the property of the Mƒôci≈Ñski family. Seven years later, in 1702, over half of the castle burned in a fire set by troops of Charles XII of Sweden. After that fire, it was never rebuilt. About 1784, the ruined castle was purchased by Tomasz Jakli≈Ñski. The last tenants left the devastated castle about 1810. The next owner was Ludwik Koz≈Çowski, who used the remains of the castle as a source of building material and sold many items from castle to merchants. The last proprietor of the castle was the neighbouring Wo≈Çoczy≈Ñski family. After the Second World War, the castle was nationalized. The work to preserve the ruins and open them to visitors was started in 1949 and finished in 1973.  Interesting facts  View of the ward. On the bottom floor, fragments of the renaissance frescos of lilies are still visible. Close to the castle, on the market of Podzamcze village, stands a chapel built from architectural elements (portal, volutes, cornice) of the castle. Inside the chapel are original elements of the castle chapel: the vault keystone, round shot said to have fallen into the castle during the Swedish Deluge (1655‚Äì1660), and a Renaissance Our Lady sculpture. The sculpture has been painted in the folk style (with oil paint) by the locals, obscuring its original appearance. According to local folklore, the Ogrodzieniec Castle is haunted by the \\"Black Dog of Ogrodzieniec\\", seen prowling the ruins at night, pulling a heavy chain. The dog is to be the soul of the Castellan of Krak√≥w, Stanis≈Çaw Warszycki, whose soul also supposedly haunts the ruins of the Da≈Ñk√≥w Castle, where it appears as a headless horseman.Bogna Wiernikowska, Maciej Koz≈Çowski \\"Duchy polskie\\" 1985  In film and television  In 1973, Ogrodzieniec Castle was used for outdoor scenes in the television series Janosik. In 1980, the film The Knight by Lech Majewski was shot in the castle. In 1984, the castle was used in the band Iron Maiden's Behind The Iron Curtain, in the video for the song \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\". In 1995, the castle was used to depict the ruins of the old Spellbinder's castle in the Australian television series Spellbinder. In 2001, the ruins were used as scenery for Andrzej Wajda's film The Revenge. For the purpose of filmmaking, large decorations were built in the castle; these remained there after filming was finished. In 2018, the ruins of the castle were used during filming of The Witcher - Netflix's 2019 series, starring Henry Cavill.

Biography Baƒçeviƒá studied painting at the workshop of Vasilije Romanovich and Jov Vasilijevich who came to Sremski Karlovci from Kyiv, Imperial Russia, in 1741. It was in Vasilievich's atelier that the first Serbian Baroque artists were trained, including Janko Halkozoviƒá, Vasa Ostojiƒá, Teodor Kraƒçun, Grigorije Davidoviƒá-Ob≈°iƒá, Aksentije Ostojiƒá and Nikolaj Petroviƒá and later at Baƒçeviƒá's own workshop in Sremski Karlovci. He is considered the most important representative of the Ukrainian baroque for the painted icons for the Nikolajevska crkva (Church of St. Nicholas) in Zemun in 1762. He also painted the iconostasis in Kru≈°edol village church (1767-1769), in the upper church in Sremski Karlovci and the large iconostasis in Jaska Monastery, significant for its numerous figures of Serbian rulers and saints. The icons in the upper tiers of the iconostasis in Beoƒçin Monastery, and the iconostasis in the village of Servas by Osijek are attributed to him as well. Among his icons the most significant are: the icon of St. John the Baptist (depicted with wings) in Kovilj Monastery, and the head of Christ kept in the National Museum in Belgrade. His icons have the dark gamma and dark green shades of the saints. The style of painter Dimitrije Popoviƒá who did the iconostasis in Ciacova (1771), Orlovat, Itebej, and Srpski Pardanj was very close to Baƒçeviƒá's.

He was created Count (Graf) Bentinck of the Holy Roman Empire in 1732. Bentinck played a leading role in the Orangist revolution of 1747 in the Netherlands. Early life Bentinck was the first son in the marriage of William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland and his second wife Jane Martha Temple. As there was an older brother from the first marriage, Henry Bentinck, 1st Duke of Portland, he did not inherit the English possessions of his father under the rules of primogeniture, but he and his brother Charles did inherit some of their father's Dutch estates, Willem inheriting the lordships of Rhoon and Pendrecht which gave him a seat in the Ridderschap, the estate of nobles in the States of Holland and West Friesland, which would become his power base in the Dutch politics of the Second Stadtholderless Period as an Orangist partisan. In 1719 Willem and his younger brother Charles were sent to the Netherlands to complete their education under the guardianship of Johan Hendrik, Count of Wassenaar. He first enrolled at Leiden university and completed his studies in The Hague. From 1725 till 1728 he went on the usual Grand Tour through most of western Continental Europe. After his return to the Netherlands and his elevation to the States of Holland in 1727 he made an arranged marriage with Charlotte Sophie of Aldenburg in 1733. As the social status of the spouses was considered too unequal (Willem being the social inferior) Bentinck bought his elevation to the rank of Imperial Count of the Holy Roman Empire in 1732 from the German emperor. The marriage was not happy and the wife soon entered an adulterous relationship, leading to a factual separation in 1738 and a formal divorce in 1743, after which Charlotte attempted to regain the possessions she had brought into the marriage, which had been granted to Willem. This led to a series of lawsuits between the former spouses which brought eventual success to Willem, but meanwhile were a heavy burden on his finances.NNBW, p. 302 Orangist Revolution As an Orangist Bentinck was in opposition to the regime during the Stadtholderless period. He championed the cause of William IV, Prince of Orange who was stadtholder of the province of Friesland in the Dutch Republic, but was denied that dignity in most of the other provinces. When the Dutch Republic became involved in the War of the Austrian Succession despite its attempts to remain neutral, and the French army successfully invaded the country at the end of 1747, the people rose against the regime of the Regenten, who were held responsible for the turn of affairs. There was a general demand for the appointment of the Prince to the stadtholdership in all provinces of the Dutch Republic and to make that office hereditary in the male and female line, not just by the Orangist faction, but also by democratic agitators like Daniel Raap and Jean Rousset de Missy. As a leader of the Orangist opposition in the States of Holland Bentinck adroitly manipulated the popular anger against the Regents, fanning the flames on the one hand, but often intervening to save Regents from mob violence, if necessary. He acted as agent of the Prince in the coup in September 1748, in which the city government of Amsterdam was overturned and put in dependably Orangist hands. His political successes made him a favorite of William IV, though he met much opposition from the prince's wife, the English Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange, and her Frisian favorites at the court of the stadtholder (like Douwe Sirtema van Grovestins). The courtiers managed to thwart most of Bentinck's attempts at political reform.NNBW, p. 302; Israel, pp. 1068‚Äì1080 Diplomatic career House of Willem Bentinck at Lange Voorhout Nr. 7 in The Hague. Print by Paulus Constantijn la Fargue in 1751. Bentinck was more successful in his diplomatic career, which started with a mission in 1747 to coordinate military efforts against France with Great Britain. At the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) where the eponymous peace Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) was negotiated, Bentinck was one of the leading delegates of the Dutch Republic. He was unsuccessful in his attempt to renew the full recognition of the Barrier Treaty by Austria, though the Dutch Republic was allowed to resume possession of the Barrier Fortresses in the Austrian Netherlands. While on mission in Austria in 1750 he worked hard to get permission to engage Duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, an Austrian fieldmarshal, as commander in chief of the ailing Dutch States Army, which permission eventually was obtained.NNBW, p. 302 Later life After the premature death of William IV, Bentinck was instrumental in putting the regency of the Princess Anne in place for her infant son William V, Prince of Orange as hereditary stadtholder- general in the Dutch Republic. His relationship with the Princess and her favorites remained tense, however, and Bentinck never regained his political influence. When the duke of Brunswick gained more and more influence Bentinck actively opposed him. He openly denounced the Acte van Consulentschap which gave the duke the factual power to continue his \\"regency\\" over William V, after the latter had come of age in 1766. This put an end to any illusion Bentinck might have had of regaining his old political position at the court of the stadtholder.NNBW, p. 303 Family Willem Bentinck was the father of the British naval officer and mechanical inventor John Bentinck.

Note that AVLS is different from AVCS used on other Subaru engines. AVLS improves performance and efficiency by changing which camshaft is operating which of the two intake valves. The camshafts on all AVLS Subaru engines have specially designed lobes for intake valves. They feature two different cam profiles: a low/mid lift profile or a high lift profile. The two intake valves in each cylinder are operated by a rocker arm with its own cam lobe. The cam utilized is selected by the Engine Control Unit (ECU). To select different valve lift modes, oil pressure generated by the engine moves a pin which locks the two lobes together. At low engine speeds the low/mid lift camshafts increases the speed of air rushing into the engine thereby increasing torque and efficiency. At higher engine speeds the high lift camshafts fully open the intake valves, reducing resistance to incoming air and improving power. AVLS only operates one of the intake valves in each cylinder as the other is always open to promote swirl.

In 1941 he established Shabab Mohammad (Mohammad Youth), a religious paramilitary group based on the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. Shabab Mohammad allied itself with the National Bloc in resisting the French mandate. In 1946, al-Siba'i founded a Syrian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, leading it through several parliamentary campaigns. After the United Arab Republic was formed in 1958, Gamal Nasser outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood and arrested hundreds of members. Joining the underground, Siba'i supported the 1961 coup ending the UAR. However, the Ba'ath government which came to power in 1963 again outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood, and banned many of Siba'i's works. al-Siba'i's The Socialism of Islam (1959) argued that Islam was compatible with socialism. It was reprinted in Egypt and endorsed by several members of the Egyptian government, though al-Siba'i complained at the use of his book to justify Nasserism. Sickness and death al-Siba'i suffered from Hemiparesis for 8 years before death on 3 October 1964.

A tame mouse runs across a woman's hand. A tame animal is an animal that is relatively tolerant of human presence. Tameness may arise naturally (as in the case, for example, of island tameness) or due to the deliberate, human-directed process of training an animal against its initially wild or natural instincts to avoid or attack humans. The tameability of an animal is the level of ease it takes humans to train the animal, and varies among individual animals, breeds, or species. In other languages, the word for taming is the same as the word for domestication. However, in the English language, the two words refer to two partially overlapping but distinct concepts. For example feral animals are domesticated, but not tamed. Similarly, taming is not the same as animal training, although in some contexts these terms may be used interchangeably. Taming implies that the animal tolerates not merely human proximity, but at minimum human touching.See, e.g., Geist 2011a,b. Yet, more common usage limits the label \\"tame\\" to animals which do not threaten or injure humans who do not harm or threaten them. Tameness, in this sense, should be distinguished from \\"socialization\\" wherein the animals treat humans much like conspecifics, for instance by trying to dominate humans.For examples with mountain sheep Ovis spp., see Geist 2011a,b. Taming versus domestication Domestication and taming are related but distinct concepts. Taming is the conditioned behavioral modification of a wild-born animal when its natural avoidance of humans is reduced and it accepts the presence of humans, but domestication is the permanent genetic modification of a bred lineage that leads to an inherited predisposition toward humans. Human selection included tameness, but domestication is not achieved without a suitable evolutionary response. Domestic animals need not be tame in the behavioral sense, such as the Spanish fighting bull. Wild animals can be tame, such as a hand-raised cheetah. A domestic animal's breeding is controlled by humans and its tameness and tolerance of humans is genetically determined. Thus, an animal bred in captivity is not necessarily domesticated; tigers, gorillas, and polar bears breed readily in captivity but are not domesticated. Asian elephants are wild animals that with taming manifest outward signs of domestication, yet their breeding is not human controlled and thus they are not true domesticates.

Od Yosef Chai includes several related institutions; a yeshiva high school, a yeshiva gedola (post-high school yeshiva), a kollel (yeshiva for married men) and the publishing house that released \\"The King's Torah\\", and other materials. The yeshiva was initially located at Joseph's Tomb in Nablus, but was relocated to the settlement of Yitzhar after the original site was abandoned following the outbreak of the Al-Aqsa Intifada. In April 2014 The IDF seized the yeshiva, which functioned as the headquarters from where violent attacks on both nearby Palestinian villages and Israeli security forces were launched, and Talmudic studies there were suspended.Yoav Zitun, 'IDF takes over extremist yeshiva in Yitzhar,' Ynet, 11 April 2014. \\"The yeshiva occupies an unusual discursive space ‚Äì neither mainstream religious Zionist (though some of its teaching staff were educated in this tradition) nor formally affiliated with the Hasidic movement, despite Ginsburgh‚Äôs own affiliation with Chabad and despite his teachings being steeped in its Kabbalistic inheritance\\". Leadership In 2003 the president of the yeshiva Yitzhak Ginzburg was charged with incitement to racism for authoring a book calling Arabs a \\"cancer\\". One of the yeshiva heads, Yitzhak Shapira, was investigated by Israeli police for his book, The King's Torah whose main focus is the halachic adjudications of killing non- Jews. The book proved controversial in its declaration that the killing of gentile babies was permissible because of \\"the future danger that will arise if they are allowed to grow into evil people like their parents.\\" Shapira was arrested for direct involvement in an arson attack on a West Bank mosque. He denied involvement and was later released due to lack of evidence. Shapira was filmed accompanying some of his students to an Arab village where he watched them throwing stones. Yeshiva high school closure In November 2011 the Israeli Education Ministry closed the religious school associated with the yeshiva. The closure was approved by Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein following the recommendation of Shin Bet on the basis of student and staff involvement in violence against Palestinians and Israeli security services. Over a period of years students had been arrested in connection with price tag attacks. Shimshon Shoshani, the Director General of the Education Ministry, stated that evidence showed the students were perpetrating violent acts against Arabs and Israeli security services with the active support of the Yeshiva Rabbis. He said that the Rabbis were both involved in the violence and the incitement of their students to commit violent acts. Shimshon stated that the violence even occurred during class time and that the school's activities were of minimal educational value. In April 2014, following assaults by Yitzhar residents on an IDF unit sent to supervise the dismantlement of illegal outposts in the settlement, the Israeli government, under the approval of Defence Minister Moshe Ya'alon, cracked down by setting up an army post in Yitzhar, and occupying the yeshiva. Major General Avi Mizrahi said to the press that, \\"This yeshiva doesn't teach Torah. It teaches evil that needs to be eliminated.\\" Yeshiva authorities denounced the precedent of a government closing a place of Torah study and branded the transformation of the yeshiva building into a military post as desecration of a holy place, according to the Jewish halacha. Funding Prior to 2013, the yeshiva received government funding associated with four different line items of the Israeli state budget: As of 2009 it received NIS 468,000 from the Education Ministry for the yeshiva high school and NIS 847,000 for the yeshiva gedola (post-high school yeshiva); NIS 707,000 from the Social Affairs Ministry for an rehabilitation project for ultra-Orthodox drop-outs and plus NIS 156,000 for the running costs of a dormitory. Philip Weiss reported on the Mondoweiss website that payments to the New York-based Central Fund of Israel were directed to the yeshiva.

Description There are six main Journey Girls; Chavonne, Kelsey, Meredith, Callie, Kyla, and Dana, each with unique personalities. A seventh Journey Girl, Jordanna, was released as a special edition doll in late 2013 as part of the Paris collection. They are targeted at girls ages 6‚Äì12 and are sold at Toys R Us. Toys R Us added another new Journey Girl doll, named Mikaella, for the Italy line, who had previously been released as the London holiday special edition doll in 2014. Likewise, the New York holiday doll, Ilee, has become a member of the main group with the Australia line, after her original introduction in 2016. The Italy holiday doll, Giovanna was not rereleased after her initial release in 2015. The top portion of their bodies are made of vinyl and the lower half is made of cloth. They have rooted hair and inset eyes. Journey Girls dolls come in a wide variety of skin tones, hair colors, and hair textures. Chavonne, originally named Taryn, is African American, a leader, and a singer. Kyla, originally named Alana, is Latina, an artist, and is shy. Meredith is blonde that is very athletic, and is out spoken. Kelsey is a pale redhead that is adventurous and loves to be outdoors. Dana is the only doll with short hair and glasses; she loves animals and is always trying to help at her local shelter. Callie is biracial, of Japanese and Mexican descent, she loves to dance, and is the fashion guru of the group. Their clothes differentiate from doll to doll and come with a wide range of accessories. The Journey Girls dolls are released about once a year with a new outfit. Each year they are realized with a different local in mind. 2013 was the Paris line; 2014 was the London line; 2015 saw the girls visiting Italy; in 2016 they went to New York; and the line released in 2017 takes them to Australia. Each line also includes outfits that correspond to the area that the girls are visiting. There are also general accessories that are always available, such as a bike, a sleepover set, a travel set, bunk beds, and a wheelchair set. The Journey Girls are produced by Lotus Onda, the same corporation that manufactures Newberry and Espari dolls, lines of 18 inch dolls sold at K-mart and exclusively at the Barnes and Noble bookstore, respectively. The Journey Girls dolls are 18 inches tall, similar to the American Girl dolls. The Journey Girls are slightly thinner than American Girl Dolls. Journey Girls can wear most American Girl doll clothes, although they may be a little loose on them. American Girl doll shoes, however, are too large for the shorter, narrower Journey Girl feet. This is especially true of pants, shorts, skirts and other clothing that is centered on the waist. American Girl Dolls usually cannot wear Journey Girls outfits. The Journey Girls range from about $30-$40.http://www.toysrus.com/shop/index.jsp?categoryId=11890194 See also *American Girl References Category:Fashion dolls ","title":"Journey Girls"},{"id":"38229912","text":"Eastern Maine Medical Center (frequently shorted to Eastern Maine or simply EMMC) is a hospital located in Bangor, Maine that serves communities throughout central, eastern, and northern Maine. EMMC is the second largest hospital in the state with 411 inpatient beds, serves more than 40% of the population of the state, and is the sixth largest employer in the state. EMMC a Level II trauma center and a home for one of three helicopters from Lifeflight of Maine. Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center is also a major training affiliate of the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine. According to Leapfrog Group, EMMC is one of 16 hospitals that were \\"A\\"-rated for safety in Maine; 80% of the state's hospitals received \\"A\\"-grades, surpassed only by Massachusetts with 83%. History In March 1891, a public meeting in Bangor resulting in a petition being circulated calling for the \\"establishment, operation, and maintenance of a General Hospital for the charitable and benevolent purposes of aiding, treating and relieving the sick, injured and disabled...\\" The petition was signed by 70 citizens. A year later, five physicians: Doctors William Mason, Walter Hunt, Everett Nealey, William Baxter and William Simmons published a notice in a local newspaper announcing that a Bangor General Hospital would open its doors on June 7, 1892; this caused some controversy over whether such a notice constituted \\"advertising\\" and thus violated the Medical Code of Ethics. A paper was read on the issue at the annual AMA meeting in Milwaukee, and a Dr. D. A. Robinson argued for the hospital. left The new hospital opened on schedule in a rented space in the Mace House. A Boston City Hospital graduate, Elizabeth Spratt, was hired as superintendent of the hospital and organized a school for nurses. That summer, three students enrolled into the program, and those students served as the primary nursing staff under Spratt. December saw the incorporation of the hospital, and Charles Hamlin stepping up as president of what is now the board of trustees; one hundred other citizens step up as well to provide funding, most notably Pricilla Blake, who provides $1,000 to the hospital. In 1893, Ellen Paine was headhunted from Mass General to replace Spratt as superintendent. The hospital trustees made plans to approach the Maine State Legislature to request funding, as over 2/3 of the patients being admitted were from outside of Bangor, but the plans were abandoned to allow for the money to fund the construction of the Eastern Maine Insane Asylum, now the Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center. Instead, it purchased the Mace house with the pledges paid by the trustees. However, overcrowding quickly becomes an issue, and to free up interior beds, the hospital pitches a tent during the summer to provide a recovery room for male outpatient surgery patients. The hospital staff divided itself in two in October 1895; a medical staff, headed by Drs. Woodcock, McCann, Swett, and Edmunds; and a surgical staff headed by Drs. Simmons, Mason, Hunt, Robinson and Phillips. Later that same year, the board of trustees voted to allow the hospital matron to set the cost of boarding at the hospital and arrange for bill collections. They also voted to disallow nonresidents of Bangor from being admitted to the hospital, except in an emergency, without a letter from their primary care physician stating the reason for their admission and a statement as to the patient's ability to pay. Charles Hamlin explained that \\"while certain regulations are necessary and it is not practicable to admit a large number of patients free, the trustees believe that it is better to err on the side of liberality and they have deemed the wisest policy to be a liberal one.\\" A dental surgeon, Dr. Langdon S. Chilcott, began work for the hospital the same year, and later the hospital was converted to electric lighting and laundry facilities were added in the basement. In 1896, the name of the hospital was changed to Eastern Maine General Hospital, to reflect the fact that most of its financial support came from the state, not the city. An addition was constructed to the Mace House, a horse shed was added, \\"a very commodious bathroom\\" was built on the second floor, and the outside of the facilities were improved. Dr. Harry Butler, an ear, nose, and throat surgeon, was also hired on. Donations to the hospital this year were expansive, including barrels of apples, canned fruit, fresh flower, and at Christmastime, holiday cakes and gifts. The hospital was chartered in 1897 by the Maine State Legislature, and a committee came to inspect the facilities. Mabel Hammons, a nursing student, recalls that \\"the always immaculate little building had an extra going over; nurses wore their best uniforms, patients were implored to smile, look comfortable and not require bedpans while the Legislature was here.\\" A new building to ease overcrowding and provide additional surgical theaters was proposed, and $20,000 was set aside for the project. Work on the foundation for the building began soon after. The board of trustees voted to tear down the existing Hospital and use its materials to help reduce the cost of constructing the new, larger building. Another doctor, Bertram L. Bryant, specializing in \\"pathology and bacteriology\\", was hired into the medical team as well. One of the three entrances to EMMC. The new ward was opened in October 1899. Extra trolley cars had to be put into service in Bangor and Old Town to help transport the large crowds, who came to take tours of the new facilities. The first interns were appointed soon after, in 1900. The hospital also purchases its first ambulance. There was a 50% increase in the number of admitted patients between 1900 and 1901, bringing the number of patients admitted in 1901 to 799. The same year, a separate building was constructed to house contagious disease patients. Overcrowding became a problem again. In 1902, a children's ward was suggested, and in 1903 the hospital began to fundraise for its construction. The project was postponed in 1904 due to a typhoid fever outbreak. The 54-bed hospital housed 75 typhoid patients, who slept in linen closets and offices. Hospital physicians blame the outbreak on the city's drinking water supply, which was piped in from the Penobscot River. Ellen Paine resigned from her position as hospital superintendent in 1906, and opened her own Paine Hospital. This hospital was later sold to the Felician Sisters and became St. Joseph's Hospital, which still exists. Ida Washburne, another Mass General employee, steps up to take her place. Later, in 1907, the state legislature approved a grant of $15,000 to the hospital for the construction of a children's ward, provided that the hospital raises $25,000 on its own. Two private citizens donate the required $25,000 in 1908. Construction of the ward began in 1909, and the ward opened on January 1, 1910. The hospital also took the opportunity to install its first set of x-ray equipment. =2012 expansion= In late 2012, the EMMC board of directors gave the final approval to a $287 million expansion project, to be taken on by Morris Switzer. The expansion consists of a $247 million building renovation and expansion project and a $40 million equipment upgrading project. The new building will allow the hospital to operate at its licences capacity of 411 beds, as well as being home to expanded and upgraded neonatal care facilities, obstetrics, cardiac healthcare services, and new operating theaters. Wal- Mart clinics Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center and its parent company, Northern Light Health, collaborated with Aroostook Medical Center, Inland Hospital, Sebasticook Valley Health, and six Wal-Mart stores, to open up The Clinic at Wal-Marts inside the stores in 2009. The stores were located in Bangor, Brewer, Palmyra, Augusta, Waterville, and Presque Isle. The clinics were an attempt to improve rural access to healthcare. Healthcare at the Wal- Mart clinics was limited to simple health problems, such as colds; ear, nose, and throat issues; and minor burns. All of the clinics except the Waterville clinic were closed in 2011 due to low patient volume, and the clinic staff were reassigned to other positions within their respective health networks. Criticism=2002 bylaw changes= In June 2002, EMMC was criticized by its own doctors for proposing a change to its bylaws that would give the hospital the ability to discipline or fire doctors who said anything that could \\"undermine an individual's trust in a practitioner or the hospital.\\" The executive director of the Maine Medical Association, Gordon Smith, stated that the bylaw was \\"really a gag order.\\" The bylaw would have prevented doctors from addressing concerns they had with how the hospital is run. A similar issue had been raised a few years earlier banning criticism of HMO plans, but had been struck down. =2010-2012 nursing strikes= In 2011, the hospital's Maine State Nurses Association member staff went on strike, complaining of issues with the hospital's nurse-to-patient ratio. The hospital has a track record of poor relationships with the nurse's union; nurses had previously threatened to strike in 2007 over the same issue, but the strike was called off two days after the strike warning had been issued to the hospital. The union threatened a strike in late 2010, again citing failed discussions regarding nurse-patient ratios and outdated health insurance coverage. The nurses took up a one-day picket near the hospital, the first nurses' strike in EMMC's history and creating public concern that the hospital would be understaffed during the strike. The Hospital responded by initiating a three- day lockout of its unionized nursing staff. Further controversy was generated when it was discovered that the hospital's recruiting service was seeking scabs on Craigslist.

In his last report, Silva Moreno covered an oil theft investigation and a gunfight where organized crime was involved, but was later killed by gunfire when unidentified gunmen tracked him down and shot him from two moving vehicles. The assassins managed to escape, and the crime has not been solved. The motives behind his killing are unknown. Early life and career Silva Moreno was born in Orizaba, Veracruz on 26 August 1978. He was a journalist collaborated for the outlets Glob@l M√©xico, Puntual Puebla, Radio Global, Diario Puntual, El Mundo de Tehuac√°n, where he covered their crime and police sections. Initially, Silva Moreno was hired in 2010 by the daily Diario Puntual to cover the local elections in the state of Puebla, and later continued his collaborative work by sending his police reports to the daily. Silva Moreno also worked for the Puebla government under the governorship of Mario Plutarco Mar√≠n Torres. Global M√©xico, one of the outlets that Moreno Silva worked for, however, stated that the reporter did not work for the government. Assassination In the afternoon of 14 November 2012, Silva Moreno and his friend Misrael L√≥pez Gonz√°lez were covering a crime scene where the Mexican military discovered a warehouse that stashed several stolen oil products reportedly owned by an organized crime group. After concluding the oil theft investigation, both of them witnessed a gunfight between Mexican soldiers and alleged drug traffickers in Tehuac√°n, Puebla. While driving back six minutes later, two trucks cut them off the road and opened fire at their vehicle. Silva Moreno was killed instantly, while L√≥pez Gonz√°lez tried to escape by running away but was caught up and shot dead by gunmen about a block away from the scene in front of several onlookers. According to eyewitnesses, the gunmen were traveling in a stolen red Ford Lobo and a Suburban SUV; the latter was abandoned a few blocks away from the crime scene after one of the tires went flat. The motives behind his assassination are still unclear, but the journalists close to Silva Moreno alleged that he was probably killed for reporting on the oil theft activities of a Mexican organized crime group or because he may have identified the drug traffickers involved in the shootout. Nearly 100 journalists, bloggers and writers have been kidnapped or killed in Mexico since 2000, making the country one of the most dangerous places on the planet in which to exercise journalism and press freedom. Most of these crimes, too, have remained unsolved, and only a few perpetrators have been brought to justice. =Funeral= Family and friends held a wake in memory of Silva Moreno on 16 November 2012 in Tehuac√°n, the city where he was killed. The funeral home urged for an intensive surveillance operation and for law enforcement presence after rumors that the family had received death threats from organized crime. =Background= Silva Moreno was killed after reporting on an oil theft investigation. The Mexican drug trafficking organizations have been reported to steal fuel from the government-owned Pemex industry to later supply them to local vendors in exchange for cash. Most of these vendors are threatened and forced by drug lords to sell the stolen fuels to other users within the country or to refineries in the United States. For most of its history, Pemex has been subject to robberies, sometimes stemmed from internal distributors or from low-level gangs who look into selling the stolen fuel at a price lower than the one available in market. But when President Felipe Calder√≥n came into office in 2006, the theft dynamics within Pemex changed; instead of being small-scale gangs, transnational criminal organizations ‚Äì like Los Zetas and the Sinaloa Cartel ‚Äì stood up to take over the illegal activities. By doing so, they managed to extend their oil theft operatives outside Mexico and began stealing crude oil in growing numbers. Los Zetas, unlike other traditional criminal gangs in Mexico, tends to favor other illegal activities besides drug trafficking; the Sinaloa Cartel, on the other hand, tends to focus solely on drug trafficking and reportedly avoids carrying out kidnappings and extortions. If the Sinaloa Cartel oil theft allegations are true, it can be suspected that the modus operandi of the organization can change, and that the advantages of stealing from Pemex sums up as an \\"attractive business\\" for both groups. Although the criminal gangs are much to blame, some members within the Pemex administration are allegedly corrupt and are \\"directly involved\\" in the illegal business. To illustrate this point, the Mexican Armed Forces seized more than 4 tons of cannabis inside a Pemex installation at Reynosa, Tamaulipas in February 2010 after security personnel notified them of several trucks carrying large sums of marijuana inside the facility, with armed men guarding them.

In 1932, he was made a FRCS. He was senior general surgeon in the Brighton and Lewes and Mid-Sussex hospital groups. In 1936, Forrester-Wood was elected to the senior staff of the Royal Sussex County Hospital, and was a consulting surgeon to several other hospitals, including the Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital, the Haywards Heath Hospital, the Heritage Craft Schools and Hospitals for Crippled Children, the St. Francis Hospital in London (1895‚Äì1991) and the Hurstwood Park Hospital. He was also later appointed to the staff of Cuckfield Hospital, built during the Second World War for Canadian forces, after it was taken over by the National Health Service (NHS). Forrester-Wood specialised in children's surgery as well as thoracic surgery and was in very wide demand thanks to his reputation. He frequently contributed to the British Journal of Surgery and the Royal Society of Medicine's Clinical Section. Forrester-Wood was secretary of the Brighton and Sussex Medico-chirurgical Society and for many years served on the executive committee British Medical Association's local division, including as chairman. After the rise of the NHS, Forrester-Wood's responsibilities expanded, and sat on numerous committees as hospitals expanded and were reorganised. As was noted by the British Medical Journal, \\"He was the unchallenged and universal choice for these offices, for his hospital colleagues had implicit trust in his judgment and integrity, and his outwardly calm temperament combined with firmness and humour to control many difficult situations.\\" Illness and death The stress apparently became too much, and Forrester-Wood suffered a heart attack in 1958. While he recovered, he was still in heavy demand, and tried to relax with other activities. In addition to his interest in stamps, he enjoyed fishing, gardening, shooting and horseback riding. He suffered a detached retina in his good eye during a fall off a horse, but his sight was saved by successful surgery. He was also a freemason with provincial rank in the Craft and Royal Arch. He was a President of the Sarawak Specialists' Society. Forrester-Wood had apparently been considered fully recovered as his death at age 57, during his sleep at home in Brighton, was considered a shock. He died before the Crawford Medal was to have been presented to him. He was survived by his widow and a son. He was eulogised in the British Medical Journal: Selected publications *The stamps and postal history of Sarawak. Sarawak Specialists' Society, 1959. (Supplement by L.H.

He previously helped the St. Louis Cardinals make draft picks. Mejdal turned his personal interest in baseball into a career after being inspired by Moneyball in 2003. Biography Sig Mejdal grew up in San Jose, California. His mother was a nurse and his father was a career army officer. In his youth, Mejdal played little league baseball for six years. He was a fan of the Oakland A's and a member of the Society for American Baseball Research. According to UC Davis magazine, Sig Mejdal was \\"fascinated with the stats on the backs of baseball cards.\\" Mejdal graduated from University of California, Davis with bachelor's degrees in mechanical engineering and aeronautical engineering. He later earned master's degrees in operations research and cognitive psychology from San Jose State University. While attending college in the late 1980s, he worked as a blackjack dealer at High Sierra in Lake Tahoe. After graduating from UC Davis in 1989, Mejdal worked for Lockheed Martin's satellite operations unit at the Onizuka Air Force Station. Mejdal's interest in baseball was recreational until 2003, when Moneyball inspired him to consider pursuing a career in sabermetrics. He attended the Winter Meetings in search for a job in baseball, but ended up working for NASA as a biomathematician in the Fatigue Countermeasures Group. Mejdal studied sleep patterns of astronauts on the International Space Station in order to optimize their sleep schedules. While working for NASA, Mejdal had a side job as the chief quantitative analyst for Sam Walker's fantasy baseball team Streetwalkers Baseball Club, which was participating in the Tout Wars competition's \\"Battle of the Experts.\\" The fantasy team would later become the subject of Walker's book: Fantasyland: A Sportswriter's Obsessive Bid to Win the World's Most Ruthless Fantasy Baseball. In 2005, Sig Mejdal was recruited to do sabermetrics for the St. Louis Cardinals' new analytics department. He took 22 months of data from college baseball games and ran it through an algorithm to determine the likely performance and stats baseball players would achieve. According to Sports Illustrated, \\"[o]ver the next seven seasons the Cardinals would draft more players who became big leaguers than any other organization.\\" He was promoted to senior quantitative analyst in 2008 and director of amateur draft analysis in January 2011. Mejdal created a formula to predict the risk of injury to baseball players and contributed a section on injury probability to The Bill James Handbook. In 2012, Mejdal became the Director of Decision Sciences for the Houston Astros, where he supported recruitment decisions based on physical tests and historical player performance. Hiring Mejdal to apply an analytics- based decision tree on their player choices was part of the effort to revitalize the team and address performance issues in prior seasons. He helped the team create the STOUT system, named after the combination of \\"stat\\" and \\"scout,\\" for making player choices. The system was criticized for de- humanizing players, but after trading off some players and making new recruits, the Astro's farm system became ranked among the best in baseball. The Astros also used analytics to persuade players that were uncomfortable with non-traditional positions on the field to embrace shifts, which the team now uses very heavily. In 2015, Mejdal was one of the team's advisers whose login credentials were believed to have been used to hack into the team's database. When Mike Elias was hired from the Astros as general manager of the Baltimore Orioles, Elias hired Mejdal as his assistant general manager.https://www.mlb.com/orioles/news/orioles-using-analytics-sign-of- culture-change Bibliography * Further reading  * References Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:People from San Jose, California Category:San Jose State University alumni Category:University of California, Davis alumni Category:Baseball statisticians Category:NASA people Category:St. Louis Cardinals executives Category:Houston Astros executives Category:Baltimore Orioles executives ","title":"Sig Mejdal"},{"id":"38230299","text":"Mellow is an album by saxophonist Sonny Stitt recorded in 1975 and released on the Muse label.Fitzgerald, M & Ziegler, F.

It was the second established irrigation district in California, using the resources of the Tuolumne River. The district now supplies irrigation water to 3,100 agricultural customers, electrical service to over 120,000 customers, and drinking water to the city of Modesto. History The Modesto Irrigation District was the second irrigation district to be established in California, in July 1887, under the Wright Act of 1887, which allowed the formation of special-purpose districts throughout California. The voters within the district's proposed boundaries were overwhelmingly in favor of the formation, but a determined opposition to the district's formation and taxing authority carried on a legal battle with the district until the US Supreme Court sided with the district in 1898. Anti-irrigationists continued to prevent the collection of taxes until 1901. The district initially sought to divert water from the Stanislaus River, but ultimately decided that the Tuolumne River was a better source of water. In 1893, the La Grange Dam was completed, enclosing La Grange Reservoir. This small dam provided a diversion point for water delivered to the Turlock Irrigation District, which provided 2/3rds of the building cost. After a long delay caused by legal battles, the district finally started providing irrigation water in 1903. Between 1904 and 1913 the Modesto Irrigation District, Turlock Irrigation District, and the city of San Francisco were embroiled in a dispute over the use of the Tuolumne River. San Francisco needed more drinking water, and the two districts wanted to continue exclusive use of the river. Despite opposition from John Muir and the Sierra Club, San Francisco ultimately prevailed with the passing of the Raker Act, which authorized construction of the O'Shaughnessy Dam on the Tuolumne River, and eventually turned the Hetch Hetchy Valley into the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. By 1940, San Francisco and the two districts had become allies to protect and develop the Tuolumne River watershed. In 1911, the Modesto Dam was completed, enclosing the Modesto Reservoir. The first Don Pedro Dam was completed in 1923, enclosing Don Pedro Reservoir. The dam construction costs were divided between the district and the Turlock Irrigation district. In 1971, the second Don Pedro Dam was completed, enlarging the reservoir from 290,000 acre feet to 2,030,000 acre feet. Electrical service started in 1923, after the Don Pedro Powerhouse connected with the Don Pedro Dam was completed. In 1978, the district merged with the Waterford Irrigation District. In 1994, the district started drinking water service to Modesto after the Modesto Regional Water Treatment Plant was completed. Reservoirs and dams There are three reservoirs operated by the Modesto Irrigation District: *Don Pedro Reservoir (New Don Pedro Dam) - 2,030,000 acre feet *Modesto Reservoir (Modesto Dam) - 29,000 acre feet *La Grange Reservoir (La Grange Dam) - 500 acre feet  Other facilities  The district operates several major facilities: *Don Pedro Powerhouse - Electricity Generation *McClure Generation Station - Electricity Generation *Ripon Generation Station - Electricity Generation *Woodland Generation Stations - Electricity Generation *Stone Drop Generation Station - Electricity Generation *New Hogan Powerhouse - Electricity Generation *Modesto Regional Water Treatment Plant - Water Treatment Governance and management The Modesto Irrigation District is governed by a Board of Directors.

Dylan first appeared on January 29, 2013. He is initially involved in a story arc involving Avery Bailey Clark (Jessica Collins), his former lover who believes he died during the war in Afghanistan. Avery is stunned by Dylan's return, but remains in a relationship with Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). Burton noted the extreme differences between Dylan and Jason Morgan. The actor was able to have a new wardrobe and look. While Jason was confined and \\"Stone Cold\\", Dylan has been credited by Burton as allowing him to portray his lighter side in addition to more of his own personality. The character was later paired with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan); their short-lived romance received negative reviews from viewers and critics alike. In October 2013, it was revealed that Dylan is in fact the long-lost son of Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott), Nicholas' mother, making them half-brothers. In June 2014, it was revealed that Dylan's biological father is Nikki's childhood friend, and chief of police, Paul Williams (Doug Davidson). Burton's performance earned him a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2014 and 2016. In October 2016, Burton announced his decision to not renew his deal with The Young and the Restless. He made his final appearance on January 27, 2017.  Casting  In October 2012, Burton departed the role of fan favorite Jason Morgan on ABC Daytime's General Hospital. That November, news broke that The Young and the Restless put out a casting call for a character named Dylan, who was slated to \\"hit the airwaves\\" in early 2013. The casting call described him as a \\"rugged, dynamic, energetic man in his mid-30s\\" who \\"comes from humble, blue-collar beginnings, was studying to be an architect when his construction/contractor father was injured and Dylan had to drop out of college to take over the business. He's done two tours of duty in the Middle East, army special ops. The war left a mark on him. He's done his best to bury it with optimism and a wry, sometimes offbeat sense of humor\\". After the casting call was issued, there was brief speculation that the character was a recast for Chance Chancellor, who was also a war veteran. Later, Burton's name was attached to the role. During an appearance on The Talk the following January, Burton officially confirmed that he was cast as Dylan. The episode of The Talk was described as \\"phenomenal\\"; Burton had no idea it would have been \\"New Year's Eve kinda crazy.\\" After one of the show's co-hosts Julie Chen made the announcement of his casting and welcomed Burton to the CBS family, confetti dropped while another co-host Sheryl Underwood did a \\"wild happy dance\\". Burton said, \\"I had no idea about the CBS badge or the welcome basket, or anything. That‚Äôs not how I think. I understood why CBS did it, because it‚Äôs a big deal. I get it. It‚Äôs so strange for me, because I have never been one for all this publicity. They have been so gracious to me, and it was so overwhelming that they would do something like that.\\" Burton made his first on-screen appearance during the episode dated January 29, 2013. He attributed much of his success going back to the 1990s when he studied acting at Theater Theater in Hollywood, California, coached by Chris Aable. Burton's casting attracted a significant amount of media attention. The Hollywood Reporters Lesley Goldberg noted that it reunited Burton with executive producer Jill Farren Phelps, who was previously the executive producer of General Hospital. Speaking about the decision to cast him, Phelps told TV Guide that the casting department were seeing several actors for the role, and the thought of Burton was \\"just a dream\\". She then contacted his manager and together they were \\"able to make it work out so that Steve could continue to have the life he wants in Nashville.\\" Discussing his decision to join The Young and the Restless, Burton said on The Talk, \\"I told my manager if I can keep my family there and I can spend time with them and come back and forth, I would do that in a second. Without hesitation, CBS Daytime made that deal. Really quickly. This is crazy, but I'm just so happy to have the best of both worlds for my family, because before, I couldn't.\\" Burton was happy with the flexibility of his \\"short term\\" contract, \\"I'll get a lot of long weekends and frequent weeks off so I can get back to Nashville. I don't want to work five days a week like I did at GH\\", he said during a TV Guide interview. The actor said he had \\"those first-day-of-school jitters\\" when he first arrived at the CBS building, but was welcomed by everyone. A week before Burton's debut on the series, a promotional ad aired, teasing his arrival with the slogan Daytime's Hottest Soap Just Got Hotter!. In November 2014, Burton confirmed he had re-signed for another year with the series. On October 6, 2016, Burton announced via-social media that he would not renew his deal with the soap, and would exit the role of Dylan.  Development =Characterization and portrayal= Burton as Jason Morgan, seen wearing a typical black T-shirt, on General Hospital (2010). The actor found Dylan to be more like himself in contrast to Jason. Burton \\"loved the idea\\" of playing a character \\"very different\\" from Jason Morgan, who was characterized as \\"Stone Cold\\". The role of Dylan allowed him to wear colors other than black, which he was famed for at General Hospital. Of returning to daytime television without Jason Morgan's \\"uniform\\" and \\"black T-shirt\\", Burton described the experience as \\"refreshing\\". Explaining his wardrobe process, he said: \\"I never had to try stuff on. I'm not used to wardrobe fittings. I had to try on about 20 different outfits! That was really grueling. It was important to shake the leather coat and black t-shirt and do my hair different, because I know people are always going to see me as Jason.\\" Burton revealed that Dylan is \\"a lot more\\" like himself. \\"Jason was so stoic and didn't really get to show a lot of personality, unless it was with Spinelli or Sam,\\" he said. Dylan has a sense of humor, and the actor felt that it would bring out a \\"lighter side\\" of his acting. In addition to his \\"entire makeover\\" which included a new hairstyle, Burton lost weight to play Dylan, as the costume department wanted him to look younger. Burton admitted during an interview with Entertainment Weekly that he was worried about how Dylan would be received, considering the \\"persona\\" of Jason is out there; he hoped \\"people will buy\\" Dylan, although some people would say \\"You are Jason and that's it.\\" Burton told Yahoo! that: \\"[Dylan is] extremely different. That's the biggest thing for me, that after playing a character, which I loved, for 21 years, coming here and trying to do something different - 'cause I know fans are always gonna see me as that character if they watch the show and if they watch both shows... So, it's definitely a challenge because I was so used to playing that character.\\" Jason's \\"confined\\" ways allowed Dylan to have a \\"little more\\" of Burton's own personality. Before his debut, Phelps revealed that Dylan was \\"greatly traumatized by what happened to him in Afghanistan\\" and had been \\"severely injured\\" but rescued, which is why people believed he had died. Along with being a war veteran, Dylan takes over his family's construction business. = Relationships = Upon Burton's casting, it was revealed by MSN that Dylan, who was described as \\"the mysterious ex Avery keeps bringing up\\" by Jillian Bowe of Zap2it, would be involved in a love triangle with his ex- girlfriend Avery Bailey Clark (Jessica Collins) and her current lover, Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). Of Dylan's storyline and involvement in the love triangle, Phelps said: \\"Dylan does come to town to find Avery but this story has much more complexity than that [...] What you think is going to happen is not what's going to happen.\\" She noted that Avery was the \\"great love of his life\\", though she may not have \\"the same feelings for him.\\" Avery believed that Dylan died during war; TVLine commented that \\"such a resurrection\\" would \\"surely\\" derail her romance with Nick. During an interview with MSN, Burton said, \\"Nick and Dylan will definitely fight for her, but ultimately, it's going to be her choice.\\" Dylan and Avery had an affair while she was still married to her ex-husband, but still had a \\"great relationship\\", which was shown through flashbacks. Dylan's primary goal in coming to Genoa City was to make sure she was happy, and if she wanted to get back together. Burton said that Dylan can't get Avery off his mind despite the fact that she had moved on. Fans of the show speculated that Dylan would be paired with Nick's ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), to which Case responded by stating, \\"Everybody‚Äôs speculating about Dylan, the new character coming to town but, all I can say is, I think it‚Äôs fun because it‚Äôs a hoot to speculate\\". Luke Kerr of Zap2it noted how fast Dylan met Sharon, and said they could potentially be a \\"popular pairing with fans\\". Of working with Case, Burton stated: \\"Sharon Case is actually very fun, and she makes me laugh. So half the time in scenes where I am laughing, I am really laughing at Sharon! She has that personality where she makes me laugh.\\" He also noted that fans of the show on Twitter have seen how \\"comfortable\\" and \\"easy\\" the character's on- screen relationship is. Dylan later shares a one-night stand with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), who was pregnant with Adam Newman's (Michael Muhney) child; she decides to pass the baby off as Dylan's, and the two later marry. Egan described the character's decision to keep the child's paternity a secret as a \\"ticking time bomb\\". Burton stated that Dylan is \\"not the sharpest tool in the shed\\", since he believed what Chelsea was telling him. When asked about the child, Burton said: \\"This kid is everything to him, so once we figure out whose it is, if it‚Äôs not his, it‚Äôs not going to be a good situation for anybody.\\" When asked if Dylan could forgive Chelsea, Burton added: \\"That‚Äôs a tough one. I don‚Äôt know what kind of mental state this is going to put Dylan in, to even think about that.\\" =Maternity reveal= In October 2013, it was revealed on-screen that Dylan is in fact the long-lost son of Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott). Scott had previously previewed her upcoming storyline in an interview with On-Air On-Soaps, stating: \\"I love this story! Now, I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs all going to turn out, but the premise, the people I get to work with, and the writing, has been spectacular. That‚Äôs all you need; good actors performing a good script, and our fabulous new directing team, and I love them all. I have not been this happy at work in a while.\\" Burton stated in an interview that he enjoyed the plot twist, and compared it to Jason Morgan being Monica Quartermaine's (Leslie Charleson) son on General Hospital. He said that he felt a connection while working with Scott, stating: \\"There is vulnerability there between us, and it‚Äôs not on purpose. It‚Äôs just something that is there. It was actually kind of there before it happened that we were on-screen mother and son.\\" In a separate interview with Michael Logan of TV Guide, Scott stated: \\"Nikki thinks she has come up with a good way of having everyone informed in the kindest way possible. If it were me, I would think, \\"I can only go through this once. It's too emotional! Let's sit everybody down at the same time and get it over with.\\" Nikki had intended to reveal the news privately to Dylan but that opportunity never comes up.\\" Speaking of how the revelation would affect Nicholas, Scott added, \\"She feels very badly about Nick losing Avery but not bad enough that she doesn't expect Nick to play nice and accept this man ‚Äî not necessarily as a brother but still as a member of the family. She expects him to find a way to be civil. She wants everyone to be happy together.\\" Speculation also arose that Nikki's son could be Dylan's best friend Stitch Rayburn (Sean Carrigan), to which Scott teased, \\"Maybe that's coming. Nikki had cult twins! You never know. I think Sean Carrigan could believably play my son. I think he looks a little like me, probably more like me than Steve Burton does.\\"  Storylines  Dylan McAvoy grew up in Darien, Connecticut, and befriended Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) during his childhood. He moved to Chicago and as a young adult took over his father's construction company after he became injured in an accident. He did construction work for Phyllis' sister, defense attorney Avery Bailey Clark (Jessica Collins). Avery's husband, Joe, neglected her and she began an affair with Dylan. Before being deployed overseas with the U.S. Army, Dylan buys Avery a ring and asks her to leave her husband for him, but she refuses, wanting to work on her marriage. Later, Joe finds out about the affair and divorces Avery. While reading a newspaper months later, Avery discovers that Dylan had been killed in Afghanistan during the war. She moves to Genoa City and begins a relationship with Phyllis' ex-husband, Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). After acting mysterious about her past, Avery admits to Nick that she had an affair with Dylan, who had died. In 2013, Dylan arrives in Genoa City, having survived the war and wanting to make sure Avery is happy. He runs into Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), Nick's ex-wife who gives him directions to Nick's club, The Underground. While posing under the name \\"Mack\\", Dylan gets a job as bartender at The Underground, so he could see Avery from afar. During The Underground's opening night, Avery sees a rock which she gave to Dylan years ago sitting on the bar. She later goes to the basement and comes face to face with Dylan. In a state of confusion, shock and disbelief, Avery hides her emotions when Nick closely follows. Later, she confronts Dylan at his apartment, angry for not telling her he was alive earlier. She tells Nick about this, who fires Dylan. Despite spending a friendly night with Dylan, Avery chooses to remain with Nick, leaving Dylan shattered. While driving out of town, Dylan's car collides with Sharon's during a major snowstorm. She calls an ambulance, as Dylan shouts for someone named \\"Sully\\". Dylan is taken to the hospital where it is revealed Sully was Sullivan, a friend of his who was shot and killed in Afghanistan while trying to shove Dylan a weapon. Sharon hires Dylan as a contractor to fix her roof, and entire kitchen, after it is damaged by the storm. Dylan bonds with Sharon's daughter Faith Newman (Alyvia Alyn Lind). During a hike in the snow with Dylan and Faith, Sharon injures her leg and Faith goes missing briefly; Dylan manages to find her. Sharon and Dylan grow closer. Later, Dylan's father's (Steve Gagnon) condition worsens, and Dylan brings him to Genoa City so he can keep an eye on him while working on Sharon's kitchen. His father dies, and he finishes Sharon's kitchen, and decides to leave town. However, he has a one-night stand with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), who is already pregnant and considering finding a fake father for her child, as she was divorcing the child's real father, Adam Newman (Michael Muhney). Dylan comforts Avery when she is being followed by men working for Marcus Wheeler (Mark Pinter), as a result of a dangerous case she is working on. Later, Dylan gets into a fight at Jimmy's Bar and is arrested. Avery pays his bail, but he can't leave town for another month until his hearing date, angering Nick. Chelsea then decides to pass her child off as Dylan's, and the two begin a genuine relationship despite Adam's suspicions that the child is actually his. Dylan later moves Chelsea into his new loft and proposes to her, to which she accepts, and he then arranges an impromptu wedding. Following the ceremony, Chelsea goes into labor and Dylan delivers the child, whom they name Terrence Connor McAvoy, after Dylan's father. However, the marriage ends when Dylan learns that Connor is Adam's son, not his. He also gets another shock when he discovers that he was adopted, and that his birth mother is none other than Nick's mother, Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott).  Reception =Casting= In December 2012, while Burton's casting was only rumored, Deanna Barnert of MSN's TV Buzz Blog wrote: \\"Assuming Burton actually comes to The Young and the Restless, the biggest question on everyone's mind is whether the former mob hit man will show up as a good guy, play another a toughie with a heart or go pure villain.\\" Barnert also said it would be \\"interesting\\" to see whether \\"[Burton's] legion of fans from Port Charles will follow him to Genoa City.\\" Jill Farren Phelps developed a reputation and \\"bad rap\\" because she \\"uses people\\" according to Mark Pinter, an actor and friend of Phelps who had been hired by her to portray Marcus Wheeler on The Young and the Restless. Barnert noted that Burton is \\"someone who has made his allegiance to Phelps clear\\" which is why \\"many fans\\" had expected him to show up in Genoa City \\"eventually\\". TV Guides Michael Logan had also weighed in on the rumors, calling Burton's \\"willingness\\" to work in Los Angeles after leaving General Hospital to live in Nashville a \\"puzzler\\". Logan suggested that there could have been more to his decision to quit General Hospital. Stephen Nichols, who had portrayed Tucker McCall on The Young and the Restless for over three years, was fired that December. Logan said Phelps, who was \\"under orders\\" to trim the show's budget, may have fired Nichols in order to afford Burton in lieu of him. Once news of Burton's official casting broke, fans of General Hospital reacted with disappointment and mixed feelings, unaware of his reasoning. While some fans were willing to support his move, others felt \\"duped\\". Burton felt that reactions from people who knew the story were \\"good\\", but it was at first \\"difficult\\". When asked by TV Guide if he would've remained on General Hospital had the show's producers \\"tried harder\\" to accommodate his personal life, Burton stated: \\"I don't want to point fingers. I know there are a lot of disappointed fans. They don't really understand what goes on behind the doors. They don't understand why I wouldn't go back to play Jason if I'm ready to work again. But what happens at GH should stay at GH.\\" Phelps dismissed rumors that she has \\"lured\\" Burton away from General Hospital. While clarifying rumors about him leaving General Hospital because of Phelps' appointment as executive producer of The Young and the Restless, Burton described them as \\"interesting\\". He told On-Air On-Soaps that he knew people would try to put \\"two and two together\\", but it was never his intention to leave General Hospital purposely, as he just couldn't reach a contractual agreement with the show. \\"It‚Äôs just like a sports player...when a deal does not work out with his team, there might be another team out there that might want him,\\" Burton said. During the week Burton debuted on the series as Dylan, the show experienced an increase of over 105,000 viewers, averaging 4.7 million viewers. Michael Fairman, during an interview with Burton, noted the \\"significant increase\\" in viewers, which Burton was a \\"big reason\\" for. =Performance and storylines= Burton's portrayal of Dylan has been generally well received. The character's romance with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), however, garnered a negative response from viewers and critics alike. Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that their storyline was \\"everyone‚Äôs favorite storyline for curing insomnia\\". Despite negative reviews, Burton's portrayal during the storyline was praised, specifically by journalist Connie Passalacqua Hayman, who wrote: \\"But it was Steve Burton as Dylan who stole the show with Dylan‚Äôs tearful and very sensitive reaction to the news, as his character loves what he believed to be his baby very much.\\" When the truth about the paternity of Chelsea's child was revealed, Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps remarked (in reference to Burton), \\"When the truth came out it provided some meaty material for this fan favorite.\\" Sara Bibel of Xfinity gave a mixed review when Dylan was revealed as Nikki's son, writing: \\"However, the foreshadowing that Dylan (Steve Burton) is going to turn out to be Nikki‚Äôs long-lost son is so heavy-handed that it seems hard to believe that the show is going in any other direction. Dylan is the right age. He looks like he could be related to Nikki. The character is in desperate need of a more ties to the canvas; being Avery‚Äôs ex is not enough to keep him in town, much less front-and-center. My big objection to this twist is, what‚Äôs the actual story? We have spent months learning every single thing about this character who probably would not exist if Y&R; hadn‚Äôt jumped at the chance to poach Burton from GH.\\" She added: \\"Dylan would get a mother to replace his father that passed away. Nikki would get a child who can use his carpentry skills to build her a nice bookcase. That‚Äôs sweet, but it‚Äôs a situation, not a plot. There really aren‚Äôt any consequences. Nick would be angry that the guy he‚Äôs convinced Avery still loves is his half-brother, but he already has one half- brother he despises. Another one really isn‚Äôt a big deal.\\" Burton's portrayal earned him a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2014 and 2016.

Education As a scholarship student, Tossani formally studied Italian language and culture at the Dante Alighieri Society and developed a fascination with form and design, originally planning a career in aviation as an aircraft designer and aviator. Opportunities for pursuing those goals were limited in Adelaide so he chose to study architecture, graduating with Honours from the Bachelor of Architecture degree program at the University of Adelaide in April, 1981. There he developed a world view drawn from a strong focus on Italian history, culture and language.Changing the face of Japan, Lumen, The University of Adelaide Alumni Magazine, Summer 2010 While at university Tossani developed a strong interest in sustainable and environmentally appropriate design, enhanced by 18 months of work experience for architect Robert Marshall, controversial Mayor of the Shire of Eltham, Melbourne and Australian architect renowned for advancing the design of contemporary earth-built architecture.Leopard‚Äôs Lair, Indesign, Indesign Publishing, April/May 2002It‚Äôs Not Just Science And Technology, Indesign, Indesign Publishing, Vol.22, August 2005 Tossani later studied urban planning in Italy at the University of Florence, then moved to the US to consolidate with a Masters of Architecture and Urban Design degree at Harvard University Graduate School of Design, where he graduated with distinction. Early career In December 1980, just prior to graduating from the University of Adelaide, Tossani founded his first practice in Adelaide specializing in contemporary residences and with a focus on environmental and thermal performance design, with projects featured in Adelaide media leading to a rapid expansion of his office, as well as invitations to lecture at local colleges on contemporary architecture and earth-building techniques. He soon partnered with prominent Australian architect Peter Villis to form the practice Villis+Tossani Architects in Adelaide.Tom Baker, The Tossani Touch, Deluxe Adelaide, 2011 During the next several years of practice Tossani's interest in the nature of beauty in architecture as well as the complexity of design issues at larger scales in urban settings, compelled him to embark on a study tour of Asia, China and Europe from February 1984. During these travels, particularly in China, Tossani studied the confluence of politics, ideology and metaphysics in design thinking at all scales, and the application in this regard of the Renaissance notion of the architect as the multi-talented artist whose creative fluency spans multiple disciplines. Intending to pursue these themes and broaden his expertise in architecture and Urban Design, he settled in Florence (Firenze), Italy, in September 1984 to work for the architecture and urban design practice of Arcoprogetti, a collaborative of professors of architecture from the University of Florence, nominally headed by Prof. Paolo Sica, architect of several notable contemporary works including the Ponte all'Indiano bridge over the Arno River. At Arcoprogetti Tossani participated in various design projects including the new science campus for the University of Florence with prominent collaborating architects including Norman Foster, Mario Botta, Richard Meier and Cesar Pelli, as well as the urban design of city precincts in Florence scheduled to be impacted by the Strada di grande comunicazione Firenze-Pisa-Livorno, an inter-urban motorway planned to bisect the city.World Design, Shotenkenchiku, Shotenkenchiku Publishing, Japan, Vol.47, October 2002 Tossani also studied urban planning at the University of Florence, tutored architecture students at the Florence campus of Penn State and translated academic papers and Grazia Gobbi Sica's book on modern architecture in Florence.Grazia Gobbi Sica (English Translation by Riccardo Tossani), Itinerari Di Firenze Moderna, A Guide to Modern Architecture in Florence, Alinea Editrice s.r.l., Firenze, 1987 In September 1986 Tossani moved to the U.S. to pursue a master's degree in architecture and urban design at Harvard University Graduate School of Design (GSD). Cross-registered at the MIT School of Architecture and Planning, he graduated at the top of his GSD class in 1988 earning a Masters of Architecture in urban design, with distinction and received the ‚ÄúAward for Greatest Overall Achievement in the Class of 1988 for Leadership and Excellence in Academic Studies‚Äù. Upon graduating from Harvard, Tossani turned down an offer to work on the Canary Wharf project for the London office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), choosing instead to relocate to Los Angeles to work for Scott Johnson and Bill Fain at Pereira Associates, (later renamed Johnson Fain (JF)), in order to pursue his interest in architecture and urban design in a city increasingly recognized for its avant-garde architecture and urbanism. At JF Tossani became the founding Director of the Guam office, and participated as architect and urban designer on a range of diverse projects including upscale residences, resorts in the South Pacific, the research campus for the Superconducting Super Collider in Texas as well as community and city master plans in Sacramento and Bangkok.

Philosophy Tossani rejects the tendency of architects to specialize in limited functional categories, and instead subscribes to the renaissance notion of architecture as a multi-disciplinary vocation whose practitioners use their intellectual and creative skills to integrate building and interior design, urban planning and industrial design. Tossani's work is characterized by the use of a limited palette of carefully selected materials, simple yet innovative forms with emphasis on natural materials, space and light, as well as the incorporation of alternative energy sources where appropriate. Tossani's architecture strives for a positive engagement with the cultural and physical context, and is heavily inflected by metaphoric forms drawn from elements found in nature. Pro bono work Tossani has created both the village master plan for the Niseko town of Hirafu in Hokkaido, Japan,Rob Gilhooly, Bigger picture in sight for local development, The Japan Times, 5 Jun 2010 as well as the Hirafu-zaka Main Street master plan, as part of an urban revitalization strategy for this rapidly developing international resort destination.

The court- ordered wiretap that made it possible to identify and prosecute Ardita was the first of its kind. From his apartment in Buenos Aires, Ardita accessed a computer network at Harvard. He stole passwords as Harvard users accessed other networks. By the time he was caught, Ardita had hacked into the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA Ames Research Center, the Naval Research Laboratory, and the Naval Command Control and Ocean Surveillance Center. Heymann said investigators worked with Harvard so they could track an intruder without violating users' privacy. He said the compromised Harvard network comprised 16,500 accounts and 13,000 users, sending out about 60,000 email messages daily. Investigators, he explained used a high-speed computer to sift through messages, focusing on 10 to 15 keywords that matched the suspect's profile. According to Heymann, investigators believed there were only two instances in which they had read a complete message that did not come from Ardita. In a press release after the warrant for Ardita's arrest was announced, Attorney General Janet Reno said, \\"This case demonstrates that the real threat to computer privacy comes from unscrupulous intruders, not government investigators\\", going on to praise the creation of procedures that focused on the intruder's unlawful activities. \\"This is doing it the right way,\\" she said. \\"We are using a traditional court order and new technology to defeat a criminal, while protecting individual rights and Constitutional principles that are important to all Americans.\\" At her weekly press conference, she elaborated: \\"This is an example of how the Fourth Amendment and a court order can be used to protect rights while adapting to modern technology.\\" The case was complicated by the fact that Ardita resided in Argentina, where the charged felonies were not extraditable offenses.

Today it is closely associated with the University of Bologna. Origins By the end of the seventeenth century the University of Bologna, one of the world's oldest and once a thriving center of artistic and scientific discovery, had entered a long period of decline. The Academy degli Inquieti was founded in Bologna around 1690 by Eustachio Manfredi as a place where mathematical topics could be discussed. At first, the academy held its meetings in Manfredi's house, where it began to attract scholars working in other disciplines such as anatomy and physiology, from Bologna and from nearby provinces. In 1694 the academy moved to the house of Jacopo Sandri, a professor of anatomy and medicine at the University of Bologna. In 1704 the academy acquired a more formal structure with the appointment of a president and a secretary. In 1705 the academy moved again to the palazzo of Conte Luigi Ferdinando Marsigli. Marsigli was a polymath, widely seen as the founder of the sciences of oceanography and marine geology. His ambition, never fulfilled, was to complete his Treatise on the Structure of the Earthy Globe, of which about 200 sheets have been preserved in the University of Bologna's library. Marsigli's goal with the institute was to gather all modern scientific knowledge within the rooms of an old senatorial residence, the Palazzo Poggi. A constitution for the Institute of Science was approved on 12 December 1711. In 1712 Marsigli donated his museum to the city of Bologna, and it was moved to the Palazzo Poggi. Early years Luigi Ferdinando Marsigli, the founder of the Institute Jacopo Riccati, who introduced the Riccati equation and was regarded as one of the most influential mathematicians of the 2nd millennium The Accademia delle Scienze dell'Istituto di Bologna was formally inaugurated in 1714, and the Accademia degli Inquieti merged into it. Marsigli had also founded an Academy of Fine Arts in his house for painting, sculpture and architecture. The Senate allowed him to join this academy, the Accademia di Belle Arti di Bologna, to the Science Academy. Pope Clement XI was a strong supporter of the Fine Arts Academy and supplied it with its statutes. The Arts Academy was sometimes called the Accademia Clementina di Bologna in his honor. The Accademia Clementina was on the first floor of the Institute in the Palazzo Poggi, the Accademia delle Scienze on the second floor and the observatory on the third floor. The science academy initially had five professorial chairs. Marsigli's vision was that the Accademia delle Scienze would carry out scientific research in the tradition of Galileo and Newton. At first, the institute did not come up to Marsigli's expectations. He found that it was used only as a place for intellectual entertainment, a place to show off to visitors to the city, and few people attended the lectures or scientific demonstrations. In 1723 a serious conflict arose between Marsigli, who had largely funded the institute, and the Senate of Bologna, who were in charge of it. The Senate had not, in Marsigli's view, met the conditions of his donation. With pressure from the Pope, the issues were temporarily resolved to Marsigli's satisfaction in 1726, but his enemies continued to be obstructive, and in 1728 Marsigli abandoned his project in disgust. Marsigli died in 1730. Various changes and additions were made to the two-story Palazzo Poggi to accommodate the needs of the institute. The Astronomical Observatory Tower (Specola) was built in 1725 to a design by Carlo Francesco Dotti. Laboratories, galleries and workshops were set up, and the institute became a research facility as well as a venue for exchanging information. In 1727 Marsigli transferred his collection of materials from the Dutch East and West Indies to the institute. The institute published its first volume of Proceedings in 1731, three volumes between 1745 and 1747, and five more volumes before the end of the eighteenth century. The institute helped pull Bologna out of its provincial isolation, reengaging with centers such as the French Academy of Sciences and the British Royal Society. Age of Enlightenment Pope Benedict XIV was a major benefactor of the Institute. Prospero Lambertini, archbishop of Bologna and later Pope Benedict XIV, was a strong supporter of the institute. Elected Pope in 1741, he arranged for purchase of astronomical instruments for the Specola observatory from Jonathan Sisson of London. He launched a major project to reorganize the library of the Istituto delle Scienze e della Arti, building the \\"Benedictine\\" wing of the Aula Magna reading room, now part of the university library. The collections and library of the Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522-1605), the natural historian, were transferred from the university to the institute. The influence of Aldrovandi may be seen in the \\"liberal Diluvianism\\" of the institute's scientists at this time, who believed in a \\"balanced integration of science, philosophy and religion.\\" In 1742 Ercole Lelli was asked to supply wax anatomical models for the institute's Museum of Anatomy. In 1743 the institute obtained the donation of the Naturalia Museum collection of natural objects that had been assembled by Senator Ferdinando Cospi. In 1744 the advice of Pieter van Musschenbroek and Willem 's Gravesande was sought in acquiring instruments from the Netherlands to teach and explore the theories of Galileo and Newton. In 1745 the institute opened a Gabinetto di Fisica, a room that held a museum and a laboratory for exploring physics. The entire workshop of the optical instrument maker Giuseppe Campani (1635-1715) was donated to the Gabinetto di Fisica in 1747. Additional funds were supplied to improve the chemical laboratories and support the Professor of Chemistry. In 1754 Cardinal Filippo Maria Monti gave the institute his 12,000-volume library and a collection of paintings that included portraits of major scientific figures. The library was formally opened in 1756. In 1757 Giovanni Antonio Galli was made Professor of Obstetrics, and the next year the Pope overrode opposition and established a school of obstetrics at the institute. After the reforms by Pope Benedict XIV, the Science Academy became a center for all who wanted to advance sciences in Bologna. A new interest arose in the theories of Marcello Malpighi, Ren√© Descartes and Isaac Newton, and in the teachings of Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo Galilei and Francis Bacon, as well as interest in social issues. The physicist Laura Bassi, who in 1732 had become the second European woman to be awarded a university degree, became a member of the institute where she presented annual papers such as her 1746 On the compression of air. Another early female member was √âmilie du Ch√¢telet. The chemist Bartolomeo Beccari looked for ways to make populations resistant to famine through a new type of emergency diet. The academy reached a high level of scientific progress towards the end of the eighteenth century under its President Luigi Galvani. In 1791 he published his revolutionary treaty de viribus electricitatis in motu musculari (\\"Commentary on the Force of Electricity on Muscular Motion\\"). Later history Seventeenth century globe in the Palazzo Poggi The Napoleonic period caused great upheavals. Around 1802 or 1803 the Accademia Clementina was dissolved, leaving only the Science Academy. In 1804 the academy was temporarily suspended. It reopened in 1829 at the command of Bartolomeo Alberto Cappellari, the future Pope Gregory XVI (Pope from 1831 to 1846), who saw the academy as the authoritative source for scientific opinions and advice to the Papal States. Pope Pius IX (Pope from 1846 to 1878) considered it an important vehicle for achieving scientific and social progress. Prominent members during those years included Antonio Alessandrini, Antonio Bertoloni, his son Giuseppe Bertoloni, Giovanni Giuseppe Bianconi, and Charles Lucien Bonaparte. The institute experienced serious economic problems during the years that immediately followed the annexation of the Papal Legation of Bologna by the Kingdom of Italy in 1859, in which the city of Bologna lost much of its political importance. In 1883 \\"Royal\\" was added to the academy's name. This was dropped in 1945. In the later nineteenth century and the first part of the twentieth century the academy revived and was home to many famous scientists including Francesco Rizzoli, Augusto Righi, Giovanni Capellini, Luigi Calori and Pietro Albertoni. At the start of the twentieth century there was a move to establish a new faculty of human sciences, led by scholars such as Giosu√® Carducci and Giovanni Pascoli. In 1907, the academy admitted legal scholars for the first time. Under the Fascist regime, the academy played a leading role in the new Royal Academy of Italy, due to important scholars such as Guglielmo Marconi and Alessandro Ghigi. After World War II the Academy of Italy was dissolved, and the Bologna Academy found itself again in serious financial difficulties. Today The academy today publishes original work in the fields of the humanities and the sciences, and promotes conferences and debates. The academy cooperates with the University of Bologna to arrange seminars attended by about 1,500 academics annually. With its legacy of frescoes by Pellegrino Tibaldi, it is particularly involved in the history of art and restoration of art. Scientific journals The Academy has published several journals during its history, some of which have been digitised and are accessible online. Typically, each journal was published in a series of up to about 10 volumes, the last in each series including a general index. Those journals include: * Annali di storia naturale, 1829-1830. * Novi Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Instituti Bononiensis, 1834-1849. * Nuovi annali delle scienze naturali, 1838-1854. * Memorie della Accademia delle Scienze dell'Istituto di Bologna, 1850at least 1923. * Rendiconti delle Sessioni dell'Accademia delle Scienze dell'Istituto di Bologna, 1851-1857.

The books investigates the potential identity of the person who became known as Cemetery John through testimony provided by the author's father. The pseudonym \\"Cemetery John\\" was used in the Lindbergh kidnapping case to refer a kidnapper calling himself ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù who collected a $50,000 ransom from a Bronx cemetery on April 2, 1932. A month earlier Charlie Lindbergh, the infant son of world- famous aviator Charles Lindbergh, had been kidnapped from the family home near Hopewell, New Jersey on March 1. However, the body of the 20-month-old boy was discovered in woods about from the Lindbergh estate on May 12.  Summary  The identity of Cemetery John has eluded generations of investigators and researchers of the Lindbergh case. In his book, Robert Zorn contends that a German immigrant previously unknown to history named John Knoll was Cemetery John. Robert Zorn's father, Eugene C. Zorn, Jr., had been the teenage neighbor of John Knoll in the South Bronx at the time of the kidnapping in 1932. By December 1963, Eugene Zorn had become a nationally renowned economist. One day he came across an article about the Lindbergh kidnapping in True magazine while waiting to get a haircut in Dallas. The article contained details about the Lindbergh case with which he had been unfamiliar. These details convinced Eugene Zorn that as a 15-year-old boy, he had unwittingly witnessed his older neighbor John Knoll with his younger brother, Walter Knoll, conspiring at Palisades Amusement Park in New Jersey with Bruno Richard Hauptmann, the man who went to the electric chair for the murder of the Lindbergh baby. Eugene Zorn recalled that although the men spoke German, he recognized the words \\"Bruno\\" (the name of one of the men) and \\"Englewood,\\" the suburb where the Lindbergh family lived. Another thing the father remembered was that John Knoll had an interest in stamp collecting, and the ransom note used a variety of odd stamps. Robert Zorn wrote the book using the recollections his father had of John Knoll. In its foreword, retired criminal profiler John Douglas, who founded and ran the FBI‚Äôs Behavioral Science Unit for 25 years, and his frequent co-author, Mark Olshaker, called John and Walter Knoll ‚Äúthe best fit anyone had ever come up with\\" as suspects in the Lindbergh case. \\"If this had been an actual police investigation, this is where we would advise them to concentrate their investigative efforts.\\"Cemetery John, p. 13  References  Category:American non-fiction books Category:Lindbergh kidnapping ","title":"Cemetery John"},{"id":"38231068","text":"Karl Justus Blochmann (1843); lithograph by Adolf Hohneck Karl Justus Blochmann (19 February 1786, Reichst√§dt ‚Äì 31 May 1855) was a German educator known for being among the first to introduce the \\"Pestalozzi method\\" of education into Saxony. From 1805 he studied theology in Leipzig. In 1809 he relocated to Switzerland, where he spent eight years teaching classes at Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi's institute in Yverdon-les- Bains.

Agile BI Agile Business Intelligence (BI) refers to the use of the agile software development methodology for BI projects to reduce the time-to-value of traditional BI and helps in quickly adapting to changing business needs. Agile BI enables the BI team and managers to make better business decisions. Agile methodology works on the iterative principle; this provides the new features of software to the end users sooner than the traditional waterfall process which delivers only the final product. With Agile the requirements and design phases overlap with development, thus reducing the development cycles for faster delivery. It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development and delivery, a time- boxed iterative approach, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change.Agile software development Agile BI encourages business users and IT professionals to think about their data differently and it characterized by low Total Cost of Change (TCC).

Twelve Agile Principles There are 12 Agile Principles (Manifesto) Agile Manifesto grouped as Process, People, and Other. =Process= 1\\\\. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.\\"Agile ‚Äì Does It Work With Data Warehouse\\" 2\\\\. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. 3\\\\. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. 4\\\\. Working software is the primary measure of progress. =People= 5\\\\. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 6\\\\. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 7\\\\. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. =Other= 8\\\\. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information is face-to-face conversation. 9\\\\. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior. 10\\\\. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. 11\\\\. Simplicity-the art of maximizing the amount of work not done-is essential. 12\\\\. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. BI model and its characteristic goals Kernochan, in his two-year study of organization‚Äôs BI process came up with the below model and its characteristic goals: # Data entry ‚Äî accuracy # Data consolidation ‚Äî consistency # Data aggregation ‚Äî scope # Information targeting ‚Äî fit # Information delivery ‚Äî timeliness # Information analysis ‚Äî analyzability =Common Issues= Kernochan‚Äôs study found these common issues with the current BI processes: * 20% of data has error in it (accuracy) * 50% of data is inconsistent (consistency) * It typically takes 7 days to get data to the end user (timeliness) * It isn't possible to do a cross-database query on 70% of company data (scope) * 65% of the time, executives don't receive the data they need (fit) * 60% of the time, users can't do immediate online analysis of data they receive (analyzability) * 75% of new key information sources that surface on the Web are not passed on to users within the year (agility) The result concluded that the adding of agility to existing business intelligence will minimize problems. Organizations are slowly trying to move the entire organization processes to agile methodology and development. Agile BI will play a big part in company‚Äôs success as it \\"emphasizes integration with agile development and innovation\\". Improving Business Intelligence Agility There are couple of factors that influence the success of Business Intelligence Agility. =Data Entry= 20% of data is inaccurate and about 50% is inconsistent and these numbers increases with new type of data. Processes need to be re-evaluated and corrected to minimize data entry errors. =Data Consolidation= Often companies have multiple data stores and data is scattered across multiple data stores. \\"Agility theory emphasizes auto- discovery of each new data source, and automated upgrade of metadata repositories to automatically accommodate the new information\\". =Data Aggregation= Is a process in which information from many data stores is pulled and displayed in a summary report. Online analytical processing (OLAP) is a simple type of data aggregation tools which is commonly used. =Information Delivery= One of the key principal of Agile BI is to deliver the right data at the right time to the right individual. Historical data should also be maintained for comparing the current performance with the past. =Information Analysis= One of the largest benefits of Agile BI is in improving the decision-making of its users. Real Agile BI should focus on analysis tools that make an operational process or new product development better. The Agile BI approach will save company money, time, and resources that would otherwise be needed to build a traditional data warehouse using the Waterfall methodology. Agile BI Checklist * A team of developers and business representatives should be assembled to work together * Select either a business stakeholder or technical liaisons to represent the business * Identify and prioritize appropriate user stories or requirements to address during an initial project * Assess various Agile BI delivery tools that can integrate with your existing data warehouse and BI environment * Initiate iterative development process Advantages of using Agile BI Agile BI drives its users to self-serve BI. It offers organizations flexibility in terms of delivery, user adoption, and ROI. =Faster to Deliver= Using Agile methodology, the product is delivered in shorter development cycles with multiple iterations. Each iteration is a working software and can be deployed to production. =Increased User Acceptance= In an Agile development environment, IT and business work together (often in the same room) refining the business needs in each iteration. \\"This increases user adoption by focusing on the frequently changing needs of the non-technical business user, leading to high end-user engagement, and resulting in higher user adoption rates\\". =Increased ROI= Organizations can achieve increased rate-of-return (ROI) due to shorter development cycles. This minimizes the IT resources and time while delivering working, relevant reports to end-users. Agile BI Best Practices # A program charter should be created, which will set the stakeholder expectations on how Agile BI system will work.Larson, Deanne. \\"BI Principles for Agile Development\\", Business Intelligence Journal, Volume 14, Number 4, Pg 41, 2009 # Start with the business information needs to provide context for scope. # Iterations should be time-boxed. # Stress on data discovery through the requirements and design phase. # Use the Agile process of incremental and iterative development and deployment. # Validate the BI Architecture and get approval on the proof of concept. # Data validation and verification should be completed for each development iteration. # Use flow charts or diagram to explain the BI process along with some documentation. # Any change that will be deployed to production should be thoroughly tested in regression environment. # Have a formal change control; this will minimize the risk as all changes have to be approved before it goes into production.

On November 27, 2012, the second song was released in promotion of the mixtape titled \\"Bodies\\" featuring Lil Reese. The music video for \\"Bodies\\" was released on January 14, 2013. On January 8, 2013, the third song was released in promotion of the mixtape titled \\"Soft\\" featuring Rick Ross, Meek Mill and Fabolous. On January 9, 2013, the fourth song was released in promotion of the mixtape titled \\"Sho Nuff\\". On January 28, 2013, the music video for \\"Nobody Knows\\" featuring Future was released. On February 13, 2013, the music video for \\"Awesome\\" featuring Wale was released. On February 18, 2013, the music video was released for \\"Everything Is Good\\" featuring Wiz Khalifa and Bucksy Luciano.  Critical response  God Will'n was met with generally mixed reviews from music critics. Dan Reagans of BET gave the mixtape three out of five stars, saying \\"Ultimately it will be up to fans to determine if God Will‚Äôn is enough of a peace offering to make up for the frustrating inconsistency they've been through with the Harlem MC.

It has been found at depths of from . This species grows to a length of SL. This species is the only known member of its genus.  Description  The threadfin snailfish is a deep-sea, cold water, probably benthic type of snailfish. Not much is known about its lifestyle, but it is probably a benthic fish that spends its time near the seafloor rather than the water column, but may be able to swim a lot in the open water if it needs it. The body is stout and robust, and it narrows drastically near the tail, giving the fish the profile of a droplet or a tadpole. The caudal fin is narrow, small, and usually gets mistaken with the fish's dorsal and anal fins (which in some snailfish and cusk-eels, morph together and replace the caudal fin) but this snailfish does have a caudal fin, but it is too small to propel the fish in the water, so it probably moves like the already mentioned cusk eels. It has a blunt snout and a wide, cavernous mouth, and has a pale pinkish coloration when alive and in the deep, but if brought to the surface, its skin and flesh will become translucent and slimy, showing the dark-colored organs which are placed in the wide part of the body (near the head). It has no comercial value.

She was the illegitimate daughter of Guillem Ramon de Borja and Sanoguera (who was in Rome in the service of Pope Alexander VI, died in 1503), son of Otic de Borja y Montcada and his wife Violant Sanoguera. Otic was son of Escriv√† Galceran de Borja and his wife Isabel de Moncada, Moncada Ot daughter of his second wife, Constan√ßa Diec. Her mother was Isabel de Montcada. She was also a niece of Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia, later Pope Alexander VI . She is not to be confused with her sister Angela Borgia and Castellverd; born of the marriage by her father with Violant Castellverd San√ß, who married Rodrigo Rois de Corella, becoming the Countess of Cocentaina or with a third figure of the same name (and not last), Angela Borgia and Moncada Llan√ßol and that, too, in 1506 settled its Llan√ßol Llu√≠s married.  Youth  In her youth she lived in Rome alongside her cousin Lucretia Borgia, whom she accompanied to Ferrara when she married Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara .  Appreciation of her beauty  Considered as a woman of great beauty, elegance, romantic, with an exquisitely feminine personality. She was absolutely trustworthy friend, confidant of the innermost secrets, favorite companion and assistant to her favorite cousin Lucretia. She won the praise of men of letters as Diomede Guidalotti who dedicated two sonnets to her, and even Ludovico Ariosto I dedicate the last song of the Orlando Furioso . Pietro Bembo 's ideal, as an \\"angel that can pray for me.\\" On 1 August 1504, from Venice, in the dedication of his \\"Gli devastate\\" the duchess Lucrezia Borgia (published in Venice in 1505), refers back to his Angela, indicating that Lucrecia, his cousin and maiden, is \\"the brave face and Angela Borgia Madonna\\".  Lady of discord: the rivalry of her two suitors of the House of Este  While in Ferrara serving Lucretia, she attracted the attentions of both Cardinal Ippolito and his illegitimate brother, Giulio. The two men were already estranged from each other due to previous and continuing disagreements, with mutual resentment between them. This situation between them escalated when both fell in love with Angela. The two brothers began competing for her love and affection. The beautiful and very young girl said one day that she preferred Giulio, and went on to state publicly that only the eyes of her favourite were worth more than the whole person of the Cardinal. At this, Ippolito's hatred towards his brother reached its peak. Several days later, in November 1505, in the fields near the Palace of Belriguardo, the two rivals met. Giulio, to his misfortune, was alone and could do nothing when the Cardinal ordered his vassals to capture him, kill him and put out his eyes in revenge for Angela's statement. The terrible command was not completely carried out, and Giulio survived, but was beaten badly and lost the use of one eye. From that moment on he began to plot the death of Ippolito, and joined forces with another brother, Ferrante, who aspired to usurp the Duke's position. The plot was directed in a disorganized manner and was quickly discovered. All conspirators and allies were sentenced to death, but the death sentences for the two princes themselves were \\"generously\\" transmuted into jail for life. In 1506, the two were imprisoned in the dungeons of the Castle of the East. Ferrante died there. Giulio survived and regained his freedom in 1559, by the grace of Alfonso II. He had served 81 years, of which fifty-three held captive.  Ancestry  Marriage and descendants  On December 6, 1506, Lucretia Borgia had Angela married off to Alessandro Pio di Savoia, lord of Sassuolo. The wedding took place in Ferrara, with dancing and comedy coinciding with the Carnival. From this marriage the following children were born: Gilbert (1508‚Äì1554), who married the illegitimate daughter of Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, Elisabetta or Isabella. Camilla, a nun of the convent of San Bernardino of Ferrara. Eleonora, a nun of the convent of San Bernardino of Ferrara. Alessandra, a nun of the convent of San Bernardino of Ferrara  Death  \\" Young Profile with Renaissance Dress \\" or \\" The Beautiful Princess \\" According to tradition, his mother Eleonora Bentivoglio, who lived in and ruled the lordship of Sassuolo, was poisoned. She died between 1520‚Äì1522, in Sassuolo and was buried in the convent of San Jos√©, in the community, with her consort Alexander, died in 1517. By then, Sassuolo was in ruins because of the incessant wars between pro - Papal and pro - French and shifting alliances in which Angela was also involved. In 1537, his eldest son Gilberto, Eleonora still alive, was simple to do and put a plaque in memory of their parents, which currently does not exist, next to the front door of the convent of San Jos√©.  Possible model for a work of Leonardo da Vinci  It has been said, by certain experts that the portrait originally known under the title of \\"Young Profile with Renaissance Dress\\", initially attributed the authorship of an unknown German painter of the nineteenth century, which recently have also been called \\"The Beautiful Princess\\", is actually a creation of the great master Leonardo da Vinci, indicating that the profile, it is appreciated that belongs to Bianca Sforza, the illegitimate daughter of the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza or Ludovico \\"the Moor\\" . However, other experts are of the opinion that this is the profile of Angela Borgia.

Melick (born December 21, 1929) is an American bandleader, pianist and arranger.  Early life  Melick was born and raised in North Plainfield, New Jersey. Like most American children of his era, piano lessons were an early part of his education. His mother was a school teacher and his father was an insurance salesman; both recognized his early interest and talent as a musician and encouraged his pursuit of a musical life. He proclaimed his intention to become a band leader at the age of 7, and has spent more than 65 years as an active band leader and pianist. Raised on the Great American Songbook of the 1930s and 1940s, he became immersed in the jazz and big band cultures of his youth. Among others, his early musical influences included legendary jazz musicians like Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Stan Kenton. His career would be most influenced by popular band leaders like Freddy Martin, Harry James, and Orrin Tucker. Melick formed his first band at the age of 13 and had his first paying gig at the age of 14, playing piano for students at a local dance studio. At the age of 16, fate offered him (and other musicians his age) a unique opportunity to perform publicly as the older, more experienced musicians were in Europe or Asia fighting World War II. He began playing local dance gigs culminating in a summer 1946 engagement at Camp Sagamore (an adult resort) in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania. It was an engagement he and his young band would play for the following two summers. Another primary influence in the direction of his career was a contemporary musician. William John \\"Bill\\" Evans was his classmate at North Plainfield High School and a friendly \\"competitor\\" for local music jobs during their high school years. A future jazz star and Grammy winner, Evans was usually the first choice to play piano at local proms and social events. Rather than remain constantly in Evans' shadow as a pianist, Melick decided the best route to success on the local scene was to be the \\"leader of the band\\" and concentrate on commercial dance music. Some 69 years later, the Jack Melick Orchestra is still going strong.  College and the Korean War = Oberlin College = Melick entered the Oberlin Conservatory of Music at Oberlin College (Ohio) in the Fall of 1947. He originally intended to enroll in the Conservatory as a piano major, but quickly came to realize that the hours of practice and focus on piano didn't fit his ultimate desire to be a dance band leader, so he switched his major to public school music education. Music education not only better suited his career path, it was also something he could pursue in the event he didn't make it in the dance band business. In fact, he thrived in his high school band. One of his early heroes was his high school band director ‚Äì Joe Schaedel. Melick's musicianship and leadership skills served him well when he was named the band's director ‚Äì as a high school senior ‚Äì as Schaedel suffered from a short-term illness. Schaedel recovered, but Melick led his classmates in the marching band all through the football season of 1946 and beyond. Schaedel had taught him how to play the clarinet so he could be in the marching band. He continued on the clarinet through college and played in the Oberlin marching band was well. Melick's College Big Band as He Strikes His Stan Kenton Pose He began working almost immediately to form his own band at Oberlin. By his second year, he and his dance band played almost every weekend throughout northwestern Ohio; parties at small colleges like Kenyon, Antioch, Wittenberg, Hiram, and Wooster. In addition, he returned to Camp Sagamore in the summer of 1948 with his high school band. In the summer of 1949, he would begin a three-summer solo engagement at a local hangout called The Club in Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey. = Military service = He graduated from Oberlin in June 1951 and headed straight home to his piano gig in Point Pleasant, but with an inkling about what might happen next. Most of his non-college friends had already been drafted for the Korean War. In early August, the letter arrived, and he reported for processing at Camp Kilmer in Edison, New Jersey. Shortly after that, he was on his way to basic training at Camp Chaffee, Arkansas. A classmate and trombonist at Oberlin, Dick Strang, had arrived at Camp Chaffee a month before. When basic training finished for Strang, he went immediately into the Army Band at Camp Chaffee. Melick figured the Army Band was his destiny in the service as well. But then, for reasons not explained to the draftees, all specialties were cancelled, and everyone was put into the pipeline to fight in Korea. The staging point was Camp Drake outside Tokyo and he was on his way there in January 1952. While awaiting his assignment, he found the camp's Service Club. The Service Clubs all had pianos, and he took the opportunity to play whenever he could. Soon after his arrival at Camp Drake, another soldier heard Melick's rendition of \\"Ain't Misbehavin'\\". Admiring Melick's play, the soldier ‚Äì just a private himself ‚Äì thought something could be done to get Melick out of the pipeline and into Special Services. The soldier turned out to be a young Hollywood actor named Richard Long. Melick didn't know him, and in his own mind, didn't give Long's suggestion a lot of thought. However, the next day, Melick began to receive calls from various Army musical commands in Japan regarding his background. Two days later, he was on his way to Yokohama. Melick didn't see Richard Long again until Melick's arrival in Hollywood in the late 1950s, but he began to tell the story that Richard Long saved his life by getting him an assignment in Yokohama instead of Korea. Pvt. Melick Entertains at the Yokohama R&R; Center in 1953 For the next year, he was stationed at Special Services in Camp Yokohama. In addition to his own playing, he booked a series of talented Japanese entertainers to perform at the EM HUT ‚Äì the enlisted men's club at the Yokohama R&R; Center. During this time, he met actor and comedian Jim MacGeorge. Melick, MacGeorge, and a handful of Japanese entertainers formed the Jack Melick Show and they toured Japan on 10-day leaves. He also met Miyoshi \\"Nancy\\" Umeki, whom he dated in Japan for more than a year. She was a well-known singer in Japan, and would later go on to Hollywood stardom. Melick's military draft period ended in August 1953 and he returned briefly to The Club in Point Pleasant Beach. However, he was so intrigued by his experience in Japan that he asked a Japanese agent, Tats Nagashima, to arrange a working visa so that he could return to Japan to resume entertaining. In November 1953, his solo piano act began playing with house musicians at Japanese clubs and U.S. military installations. Career Melick spent another year entertaining in Japan, and in November 1954 decided it was time to begin his \\"real career\\" in the United States. So he returned home at the age of 24. He placed an ad in The Billboard magazine promoting himself as a pianist and within two days had telegrams and phone calls from numerous bands. He selected a band led by the only name he recognized ‚Äì Leo Peeper ‚Äì and joined Peeper's \\"territory band\\" in Muscatine, Iowa in late 1954. Soon, the band's publicity began touting \\"Leo Peeper and His Orchestra, featuring Jack Melick.\\" The \\"territories\\" comprised numerous dance ballrooms throughout the United States, most notably in the midwest and southwest from Minnesota to Texas. Most towns, even the small ones, had a dance ballroom or hall, such as an Elks Club or Moose Lodge. Dozens of territory bands played one-nighters at these halls from the 1920s through the 1960s. Melick had been with Leo Peeper for just 4 months when he got a call from Jimmy \\"Dancing Shoes\\" Palmer ‚Äì a Chicago band leader. He offered Melick a job at considerably higher pay, but what intrigued Melick the most was an ambitious schedule that culminated in a two-week engagement at the world-famous Hollywood Palladium. He accepted the position and joined Palmer's band in early 1955. By the time they reached Los Angeles, he was Palmer's featured pianist and had two solos during each performance.  The Hollywood years  The Jimmy Palmer Orchestra on \\"Palladium Dance Time.\\" Melick is at the piano far left. = On KTLA = The Hollywood Palladium hosted a TV show ‚Äì broadcast on KTLA ‚Äì called Palladium Dance Time every Tuesday night. It was the practice of the Palladium to feature the current band on the television show. So Palmer's band arrived on a Monday night and was performing on television the very next night. Melick had a solo in each half-hour of the show. His performances that first Tuesday caught the attention of the show's director. The next morning he was invited to the KTLA studios to meet with television pioneer and station manager, Klaus Landsberg, about a new Friday night show to replace Lawrence Welk, who had departed KTLA for the ABC television network. Melick, along with a handful of other featured players, was hand-selected by Landsberg to join renowned band leader Orrin Tucker on a new dance music program; The Orrin Tucker Show.\\"House Band Policy Looms For Palladium,\\" The Billboard, May 28, 1955 Melick was briefly the center of controversy as Jimmy Palmer publicly accused Landsberg of stealing his piano player.\\"Jimmy Palmer Assails 'Raiding' By Landsberg During Coast Date,\\" DownBeat, May 29, 1955 It didn't last long and everyone involved got a bit of free publicity. Melick remained the featured pianist on The Orrin Tucker Show until it was cancelled in October 1956 shortly after Landsberg's death.\\"KTLA Drops 2 TV Music Segs,\\" The Billboard, October 20, 1954 Melick settled in Hollywood during these years and Los Angeles remained his home base until 1966. While playing for Orrin Tucker on television one night a week, Melick also began playing across the street from Universal Studios at a local piano bar called The Keys. The studio system was still in force in Hollywood in 1955‚Äì1956, and The Keys was a favorite local hangout for such young stars as Clint Eastwood, William Reynolds, and David Janssen, in addition to the many crew members and stunt men. He also renewed his friendship with two fellow soldiers from the Korean War; Jim MacGeorge and Richard Long. MacGeorge had embarked on a very successful career as a voice actor and comedian. Long had resumed his busy career in film and television (but never accepted the idea that he had saved Melick's life). = MCA Calls = Melick remained briefly at KTLA once The Orrin Tucker Show went off the air, and played as a guest performer on the station's remaining music shows like Bandstand Revue. During these remaining months at KTLA, he was approached by the booking division of MCA, Inc., one of the largest talent agencies at the time. Lured by MCA's belief they could make him the next big band star, Melick signed. They would be his first and only agent. The desired level of name recognition never quite materialized, but MCA would keep him busy in quality roles as a band leader or piano soloist for the next several years. The Jack Melick Orchestra ‚Äì Melick's first Big Band at the Hotel Statler in Boston He began touring immediately and his first assignment was to organize a band from southern California for a 3-month engagement in Boston in the dead of winter. It was the beginning of real life in the band business. He called Los Angeles his home, but didn't spend much time there. Early bookings included recurring engagements in Los Angeles, Hollywood, Albuquerque, Phoenix, the High Desert of California, and Reno. An early fan was Charles Mapes, proprietor of the Mapes Hotel in Reno. MCA had booked Melick in the hotel's casino lounge, as a trio, beginning in 1957.\\"Jack Melick Trio Is Popular at Mapes,\\" Nevada State Journal, August 15, 1958 At Mapes' request, Melick returned regularly for a couple years, and his fortunes changed for the better in late 1959. The Sky Room ‚Äì the hotel's main show room ‚Äì had been closed for that summer, and the show room's house band, Eddie Fitzpatrick and His Orchestra, moved across the street to the Riverside Hotel. Mapes was planning a grand re-opening to coincide with the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley and was looking for a new band leader. MCA highly recommended Melick be promoted from the lounge to the Sky Room. Mapes contacted Eddie Fitzpatrick and he agreed with MCA. Melick became the house band leader at the famous Sky Room until it closed for good in the summer of 1960.\\"Orc Leader Jack Melick Returns to Mapes Hotel,\\" Reno Evening Gazette, November 27, 1959 His band played for the likes of Ken Murray, Jan Murray, Mickey Rooney, Lili St. Cyr, Sammy Davis, Jr., Myron Cohen, Betty Grable, George Gobel, Dennis Morgan, Billy Eckstine, Jack Carson, and Milton Berle, among others. White Tie and Tails at the Sultan's Table in 1966 Once the Sky Room closed, MCA brought him back to California where he resumed some of his prior regular engagements including the Casino Room at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles and comedian Jerry Lewis's restaurant in Hollywood. In addition, he began a solo gig at the Dunes Hotel in Las Vegas which would become part of his regular schedule every summer during the years he was based in Los Angeles. The Dunes had an exclusive restaurant called The Sultan's Table. White tie and tails was his \\"uniform\\" and a 9-foot grand piano was his instrument. The Sultan's Table was a favorite among the celebrities working in Las Vegas at the time. Comedian Louie Nye and the legendary Frank Sinatra were among Melick's fans. Liberace, the headliner at the neighboring Riviera Hotel, was a regular at the restaurant when Melick played. Melick also developed a relationship with Bobby Sherwood, a well-known band leader and performer, who often played at The Dunes when Melick did. = \\"Jack, this is Guy\\" = In August 1960, in between MCA engagements, he got an early-morning phone call from Guy Lombardo. Lombardo had temporarily lost Fred Kreitzer ‚Äì one of his twin piano players ‚Äì to injury. As the leader of an east coast band, Lombardo was unfamiliar with the artists that toured the western venues, so he contacted his friend and well-known band leader, Freddy Martin. Martin and Melick had worked together at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles where Martin was the band leader at the famous Cocoanut Grove while Melick headlined the Casino Room. Martin recommended Melick. Melick located his red coat and joined Lombardo's band in Lake Tahoe as one of their twin piano players. He toured as a member of the Royal Canadians until his next MCA commitment in December of that year ‚Äì the Chaparral Club in Dallas. = On the Road Again = What he didn't know at the time was that the Chaparral Club would become a regular engagement every year for the next 34 years. The southwest in general, and Dallas in particular, remained a viable market for big band dance music long after the Great American Songbook faded away in most areas of the country. The Chaparral Club became his \\"home away from home\\" throughout the 1960s. For the next few years, Melick toured from Las Vegas to Dallas to Los Angeles. In early 1964, Melick replaced his winter stops in LA with a return to his beloved Japan where he did what he did in his wartime days ‚Äì touring with local musicians at clubs and military bases throughout Japan, and southeast Asia.Max E. Lash, \\"Jazz in Japan: Welcome Sound of Pianist Melick,\\" Japan Times, March 10, 1965 In 1967, he ended his regular visits to Las Vegas and the Far East and focused his efforts entirely in the southwest, adding the Warwick Hotel in Houston. At the urging of his many Dallas-based patrons, he focused primarily on the lucrative society band business based in Dallas with occasional one-nighters around Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. The long one-nighter tours were over. Melick had firmly established himself in the society band business, based in Dallas.Tony Zoppi, \\"Bandleader Melick Finds Home,\\" Dallas Morning News, December 11, 1966 = Dallas career = Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the society band business in Dallas had been led by a relocated New York band leader named Joe Reichman. When Melick shifted his residence from Los Angeles and moved permanently to Dallas in December 1966, he had already been playing in Dallas for many years so he was well known in Dallas musical society. Reichman and another Dallas band leader Herman Waldman welcomed Melick to Dallas as a permanent resident. In fact, Reichman was instrumental in helping Melick acquire his local musician‚Äôs union card. Throughout the 1960s Melick had become well-known and in-demand on the Dallas country club circuit. Therefore, it was Reichman‚Äôs opinion that Melick should be welcomed with open arms. Among Melick‚Äôs patrons in those years were the icons of modern Dallas ‚Äì R.L. Thornton, Jr., John M. Stemmons, John W. Carpenter, Felix McKnight, Joe Dealey, Dick Blair, Harwood K. Smith, and many others. Melick also endeared himself to the Dallas Jewish community. He met several of the Jewish members of the Chaparral Club including Howard B. Wolfe, an entrepreneur in the garment industry. One of Wolfe's daughters was getting married and he asked Melick if he had ever played a Jewish wedding. As a \\"Jersey boy,\\" he had indeed, as far back as high school. Wolfe asked him to do the job, and another market opened up for him. He went on to play for other Dallas business icons from the Jewish community such as Donald Zale and Lester Melnick. One of Melick's band members, Marshall Head ‚Äì who still plays with him today ‚Äì acquired a book of clarinet solos from a well-known Jewish musician on the California social circuit named Mickey Katz. Soon he was accurately emulating Katz's playing style and the Jack Melick Orchestra became known as the \\"best Jewish band\\" in town.Interview with Jack Melick, August 7, 2011 Melick's principal rival in the society band business was a band leader and arranger named Mal Fitch. While Melick's home venue was the Chaparral Club, Fitch was the principal act at the Cipango Club. Both were waiting for the imminent retirement of Reichman. Intense rivals throughout the period, Melick and Fitch eventually became friends, and there was more than enough work to keep them both busy, even as Reichman continued to work in Dallas. As societal trends changed more and more away from the pure big bands, Melick found an opportunity to co-exist with the new sounds of the 1960s and beyond at weddings, debutante parties, and other social events. It's one of the reasons he's still in business today. In Melick's own words, \\"When rock and roll started to become real popular, I would meet with the debutante or bride, her mother, and sometimes her grandmother ‚Äì you know, the one who was paying for the whole thing. The bride or the debutante would always ask if we could mix in some rock and roll with our music. I'd say, 'Sorry, we don't do that, but those bands don't try to play \\"In the Mood\\" either!' So I proposed a new program. We'd play from 8:00 until 11:00 or so while grandma was there, and then we'd fold up and bring a local rock band in to go until 1:00 or so in the morning. That was not my original idea, but that's what started to happen. And we became very successful with it.\\" He was so successful with it, in fact, that many society parties took it to the next level. The Jack Melick Orchestra played one early 1970s event in Corpus Christi. His band was outside where the owners had built a temporary dance floor over the swimming pool. Meanwhile, inside the residence, the rock band set up. More or less on cue at 11:00pm, Melick's band hit their last note and inside the house, Chubby Checker and his band struck the first note of \\"The Twist\\", and the transition to rock and roll for the rest of the evening was complete.  And the Beat Goes On  Jack Melick in 2012 Melick is a Founding Member of the Big Band Academy of America (BBAA), and is a member of the North Plainfield High School Alumni Hall of Fame. The sounds of the Jack Melick Orchestra are alive and well today. Based in north Dallas, he and his 11-piece band play a \\"semi-retired\\" schedule of 4 ‚Äì 6 dates per month at dance halls, hotel ballrooms, and clubs around the southwest in Dallas, Houston, Tyler, and other cities. In fact, in September 2012, the Jack Melick Orchestra played a charity ball named the Highland Springs Gala. Sixty-nine years after his first paying gig at Doris Mae's Dance Studio, the Jack Melick Orchestra played the largest dance it has ever played.  Personal  Melick was married to Nancy Dow from 1956 through 1961. The couple had one son, John T. Melick, III, (born 1959).

When it was dedicated on December 25th, 1900, Rev. H. William Stiles was the first pastor to serve in that building, the first brick church in Ada. Edward F. Wheeler, pastor from 1886-90, helped acquire the church bell by writing to his mother in New England and informing her of their need. She enlisted the aid of several churches in her vicinity to secure the money necessary and sent it to her son. In April, 1938, it was discovered that bees had made a home in the belfry. A beekeeper was called in to smoke out the bees. A large quantity of honey was revealed, which was canned by the Ladies' Aid after being extracted from the combs. Nearly a hundred quarts were obtained and cold to the local stores. On June 5th, 1970, the congregation voted to combine with the United Methodist Church of Ada and form a new congregation, Faith United Church, whose building would be built on the west side of Ada on Hwy. 200. Their current building was donated to the Norman County Historical Society who housed their museum there until the Flood of 1997. Rev. Rolf Stohler was the last pastor to serve in this building. In 1984, the Norman County Historical Society applied for and were granted approval to the National List of Historic Places. P.S. Before designing this church, Charles Waterbury had attended MIT and graduated in 1895. He became a member of the American Institute of Architects in 1909 and after working in Chicago, he moved to Washington D.C. in 1918. In May 1918 he became an Army Captain and served in the Construction Division of the Army as Chief until his death in Oct. of that year.

Background  A lattice is called algebraic if it is complete and compactly generated. In 1963, Gr√§tzer and Schmidt proved that every algebraic lattice is isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some algebra.G. Gr√§tzer and E. T. Schmidt, Characterizations of congruence lattices of abstract algebras, Acta Sci. Math. (Szeged) 24 (1963), 34‚Äì59. Thus there is essentially no restriction on the shape of a congruence lattice of an algebra. The finite lattice representation problem asks whether the same is true for finite lattices and finite algebras. That is, does every finite lattice occur as the congruence lattice of a finite algebra? In 1980, P√°lfy and Pudl√°k proved that this problem is equivalent to the problem of deciding whether every finite lattice occurs as an interval in the subgroup lattice of a finite group.P√°lfy and Pudl√°k.

Early life and education Born in Alameda County, California to Marilyn (n√©e Burgesen) and Glenn Willis, Mark is the elder of two children. His sister is two years younger than he. He grew up in Paradise, California, graduating from Paradise High School in 1987. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in international relations from California State University, Chico. He went on to garner his Master of Science in Management Information Systems at Bowie State University in Maryland, and a Juris Doctorate from George Mason University School of Law. Military service Willis was a counterintelligence agent in the United States Army from 1993 to 1999, serving in Haiti as well as Bosnia. He worked with the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) from 1999 to 2008. During that time, from 2000 until 2005, he served as an information technology liaison between INSCOM and the National Security Agency (NSA) personnel divisions. He has been an application security manager and analyst for a Fortune 100 company from 2009 until the present time. Personal life Willis and his wife, Violet, own Kilby Ridge Farm, in Dennysville. They raise Icelandic sheep, heritage poultry, and heirloom vegetables. They have been married eighteen years and have two children. Their son, Declan, is 12, and their daughter, Brynne, is 4. Politics Willis served the Maine Republican Party as the Dennysville Town Chair and is also on the Dennysville School Board. He was a member of the Maine Republican Liberty Caucus and has been endorsed by the National Republican Liberty Caucus. Other endorsements have come from Lambda Legal, the National Rifle Association, Maine's Tea Party. In 2013, Willis announced his intention to run for the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee, pledging to identify and support other libertarian and constitutionalist candidates if successful. He also advocated for the abolition of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the repeal of Section 1021 of the NDAA. Willis was a Ron Paul delegate for the State of Maine in the 2012 Republican National Convention, during which the RNC removed half of that delegation. Willis and the delegation staged a walkout from the convention when their appeals were denied. Objections to the 2012 RNC Rules Changes Willis has criticized the rules adopted by the RNC, particularly Rules 12, 16, and 40, which were instituted in what many believe to be a dubious manner during the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa. Rule 12 allows members of the Republican National Committee to amend the party's rules (except for Rule 12 itself) at any time, rather than during national conventions, as had previously been the case. To do so requires a three- quarters vote of the body of the RNC. Rule 16 forces individual state Republican Party committees to use statewide \\"presidential preference polls,\\" such as straw polls or primaries, to determine which candidate delegates will be bound to. This is counter to many of the states' procedures. Rule 16 also allows the presumptive presidential candidate to disavow or veto any bound or allocated delegate for any reason whatsoever. In other words, the candidate who is most likely to win the vote at the convention will be allowed to remove delegates who are likely to vote for other candidates. This is to be done before the presumptive candidate is elected. Rule 40 removes the former requirement for a plurality of five states in order to nominate a candidate for president and/or vice president and replaces that requirement with the requirement of a majority of eight states. 2013 Election of the RNC Chair After a grassroots organization called for Priebus to step down and collected nominations from readers, Mark Willis, the front runner, agreed to run for RNC Chair if he were nominated. The election of the RNC Chair was held on January 25, 2013, and won by Priebus.  Resignation from the Republican Party  In August 2013, Willis, until then a member of the Republican National Committee, was one of thirteen Maine Republicans to resign en masse from the Republican Party, saying, \\"We can no longer associate ourselves with a political party that goes out of its way to continually restrict our freedoms and liberties as well as reaching deeper and deeper into our wallets.\\"Gentilviso, Chris. \\"13 Maine Republicans Are Done With The GOP, Decide To Leave Party\\" Huffington Post August 19, 2013 References Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:Maine Republicans Category:People from Paradise, California Category:California State University, Chico alumni Category:Bowie State University alumni Category:Antonin Scalia Law School alumni Category:People from Washington County, Maine ","title":"Mark Willis (politician)"},{"id":"38231844","text":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 2085, adopted unanimously on 20 December 2012, authorized the deployment of the African-led International Support Mission to Mali (AFISMA).

Janson had previously founded the Free Christian Church of Minneapolis, later known as the Nazareth Church. The organizers of the church in Hanska asked Janson to be their minister, and he came to the area and established the church in January 1882. By the fall of 1882, the congregation had raised enough money to build a church. It was built the next spring and hosted its first service on July 8, 1883. The next week's service on July 15 would be the last, because the building was demolished by a tornado on July 21. Some critics said it was God's punishment for a group of dissenters. Nora church museum The church was rebuilt later in 1883, and it was dedicated on July 13, 1884.

He had more than 60 solo exhibitions in his career, and his works are held in the collections of many top public museums. Life and career Harvey Quaytman was born on April 20, 1937 in Far Rockaway, Queens, New York. His father, Marcus Quaytman, was a 1920 Jewish immigrant from Lodz, Poland and a certified public accountant, and his mother Rose Quaytman was a piano teacher from Lawrence, Long Island, New York. In 1940 his father and grandfather were killed in a train crash in Queens NY. From 1955-1957, he attended Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York, but graduated in 1959 with a BFA from Tufts University and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, MA. It was there he met and married fellow painting student, future award-winning American postmodern poet Susan Howe, and in 1961 they had a daughter, Rebecca Quaytman, who is now a well-regarded abstract painter.Cate McQuaid. In 1963 the family moved to Soho, New York City, but two years later the parents divorced, and Susan married Harvey's close friend, sculptor David von Schlegell. In 1966 Harvey met and later married the painter Frances Barth. They were together until their divorce in 1980. In November 1989, Quaytman was married for a third time, in his studio, to Margaret Moorman, a writer. Their daughter Emma was born in 1989. Harvey Quaytman died in New York on April 8, 2002 from cancer. Awards and honors In both 1972 and 1975, he was awarded a CAPS Grant, and in both 1979 and 1985, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1983, he received an Artist‚Äôs Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, and by 1993 he became a Member of the National Academy of Design. In 1994, he won the Elizabeth Foundation Prize for Painting, and finally, in 1997, he received the Academy Award in Art from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Works In the context of artistic movements, Harvey Quaytman was considered an anachronism. During his career, from the late 1960s to late 1990s, he continued to relentlessly explore Geometric Abstraction and Modernism - fields in which the innovation had been considered largely developed by the end of the 1950s and 1960s. Yet he pushed ahead, and according to critics he became bolder over time - more innovative, assured and successful in each decade. Even in his later years, he was recognized for finding dynamic, new forms of abstraction.Curt Barnes. Moon Fancy, 1969 In the late 1960s and 1970s, situated in settings like the Whitney Biennials, his paintings were easily recognized among the crowd due to his masterful use of shaped canvases.Donald Goddard. They were large, often curved, and frequently enclosing wall space. The painting itself blended elements from abstract expressionism and geometric abstraction, over time shifting further towards geometry. The surfaces were never simple. By the 1980s, he returned to the rectangular and square canvas, and eventually to the cruciform (cross) shape, which would become a focus for the next decade. \\"Harvey Quaytman's shaped canvases are among the most impressive;\\"Vivien Raynor. and \\"Some of the best shaped canvases of the last two decades have come from Harvey Quaytman. But in this selection of new work, the painter has, so to speak, drawn in his horns, confining himself to the right angle and in most cases to a cruciform image.\\" -Vivien Raynor, New York Times, 1986Vivien Raynor. Untitled, 1991 By the 1990s, he had abandoned the curve, and remained fixed to the cross, often in the shape of the canvas or upon it. He frequently blended rust (which he first used in 1969) and acrylic, as well as glass - creating a spectrum of textures. After 1998, he was unable to work. After his death in 2002, McKee Gallery, his longtime representative, organized a lauded retrospective titled \\"Harvey Quaytman: A Survey of Paintings and Drawings 1969-1998\\". Later retrospectives were organized by McKee in 2005, \\"Harvey Quaytman‚Äôs current show, Flying the Colors, is strong, deep, and soaring.

Many world-renowned architects participated, among whom were: Mario Botta, Norman Foster, Gae Aulenti, Hans Hollein and Vittorio Gregotti. As part of the Grandi Uffizi initiative, a 60 million euro renovation and development project for the overall museum, the loggia's construction became a controversial subject for Florentines and thus has been at a standstill since its original scheduled completion date of 2003. The project was envisioned as a large steel and stone loggia that would echo its counterpart, the Loggia dei Lanzi on Piazza della Signoria. While at the same time, it would comment on the precarious balance that exists between tradition and modernity in a context that seldom sees large architectural change. Concept Loggia are common and prominent public structures in Florence; to cite two examples, Loggia dei Lanzi, or the Loggia del Grano. For the final proposal at the competition, the architect Arata Isozaki and Andrea Maffei replicate this traditional form for both its historic but also functional aspects: providing cover and protection from the elements when necessary yet also establishing a new public reference point for Florentine people. The light trapezoidal cover of the loggia, narrows where it connects to the museum, and references, according to the architects, brunelleschian themes from Renaissance. The structure intended to allow the public to interact with the city by providing not only necessary programme and space for the museum's expansion, but to allow for a constant flow of people through a neglected space within the current fabric of the city. In 1990, a design for the exit had already been proposed before the competition. The project by Giovanni Michelucci consisted primarily of a glass prism that would lead people out; it would become a landmark to decorate the back of Giorgio Vasari's famous structure. Though never realized, this endeavor became a forerunner to the competition of 1998. =Gallery= File:Isozaki Maffei model of intervention. Uffizi Exit.jpgModel of proposal. File:Isozaki Maffei model of intervention img 2. Uffizi Exit.jpgModel of proposal in context. Building The proposal for the building was designed as a structure with limited connection to the ground. The use of a historic typology to define the form was an aesthetic choice the competition judges appreciated and awarded. A tall fan-shaped structure, large enough to span the entire slanted site, would be made principally of steel, pietra serena and glass. The new exit was created not to compete with the existing grand entrance, or to deviate visitors from the main promenade through the museum. Instead it was focused on revitalizing the area by Piazza Castellani, which had become an afterthought. The loggia was designed as a piece that would settle amongst the existing buildings, yet stand in contrast as a modernist addition to the city. The simplicity allowed the architects to create a continuous space, one that would blur the interior with the exterior. Pietra serena was chosen to pave the ground of the exterior sloping plane and outdoor areas, visually merging the space. The canopy was composed of a series of horizontal beams, arranged in a radial manner within a trapezoidal frame. Covered with glass panels, the Tuscan sunlight would filter through the space creating interesting shadows as the sun traversed the sky. Four thick columns support the large horizontal plane, and serve to highlight the existing beauty of Giorgio Vasari's windows, which were not altered in the architect's proposition. The back columns are connected to a stone block that covers the exits, but manages at the same time, to highlight the back facade of the existing building. The areas below the ramp, of approximately 300 square meters, would be designated to the museum's extension, principally in the form of storage. The slope of the site, an important historic element was extended in order to connect the existing Vicolo dell'Oro street and the network of smaller passageways with Via dei Leoni. At the center of the space, the architects decided to place four of the Uffizi's sculptures on pedestals matching the exit sequence at the back. The new intervention intended to create an interesting reciprocity between the new structure and that of the Loggia del Grano (its historic complement that dominates the corner across the street) and \\"become an instrument for the museum to communicate with the city\\". Current debate Excavation under plaza area The project for the new exit of the museum continues to be a sensitive subject for Florentines. The project has been at a stand-still since 2003 when it was originally intended to be unveiled. The debate over the loggia became both a political argument as well as an aesthetic one. Ruins below the Uffizi were discovered not long after excavations began which made the project even harder to realize due to strict preservation policies. Today, the debate continues to divide the city in two, those who support the project and those who stand against it. The new changes within the Uffizi building have made the realization of the modern loggia even less of a possibility; thus creating what the media has coined as a \\"cultural wound\\". However, even to this day appeals are continuously made by groups of architects, artists and art collectors to build the project, all in the hope of introducing a modern project amidst the grandiose historic buildings of Florence's core.

Ford Presidential Library and Museum in Michigan, United States. Didier worked at the University of Michigan from 1977 to 1999, where she earned her Doctorate (PhD) in 1982. She was appointed as a board member in October 1997 at Compuware, a Detroit, Michigan based software company with products aimed at the information technology departments of large businesses. In July 1999, Didier left the University of Michigan to become dean of Kresge Library at Oakland University. Didier became director of the Ford Presidential Library and Museum in January 2005. Didier led efforts to increase attendance to the museum. For her accomplishments, she received the University of Michigan Distinguished Alumni Award and the Rotary Club Distinguished Service Award. Early life When she was 18, Didier enrolled at the University of Michigan, where she met Gordon Didier, an economics student in 1969. After dating only three weeks, Didier and Gordon were involved in a rollover of an MGB sports car in which Didier suffered a broken vertebra. In 1969, Didier earned a Bachelor of Arts (BA) (Honors English) degree in Library Science. She completed her Master of Arts in Library Science (AMLS) at the University of Michigan in 1971, which is the same year she married Gordon. Didier earned a Doctorate (PhD) degree at the University of Michigan in 1982, and studied at Oxford University. Career Didier began working at the University of Michigan in 1977, and held a variety of positions there over the next 22 years, including: director of information resources at the School of Business Administration, director of the Microcomputer Education Center, assistant director of the University Computer Center, director and assistant director of instructional strategy services, visiting assistant professor in the schools of Education and Information, and library media consultant to the Bureau of School Services. In 1987, Didier was elected president of the Association for Educational Communications and Technology, an academic and professional association dedicated to improving education through technology. At Michigan's Business School Library in the early 1990s, Didier promoted experimentation with full-text digital archives as a substitute to paper business journals in anticipation of future delivery of electronic information. In 1993, Didier was the first woman elected president of the Ann Arbor Rotary Club, a branch of the international service club whose stated purpose is to bring together business and professional leaders in order to provide humanitarian services, encourage high ethical standards in all vocations, and help build goodwill and peace in the world. In the fall of 1993, Didier resigned her position as director of information resources in the Kresge Business Administration Library to become associate dean of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies. As associate dean, Didier oversaw a US$29 million budget and 55-member staff. In 1994, Didier served as a first-time regional chair of the University of Michigan's United Way Campaign after being involved in the campaign for years. In 1996, Didier became an adjunct associate professor in the University of Michigan School of Information and director of Residential and Research University Programs, Academic Outreach, an extended learning program of the University of Michigan's libraries that offered online distant learning to people worldwide. In her position as director of Residential and Research University Programs, Didier oversaw expansion of the library information systems, spring/summer programs, and the University's distance education programs, including its intellectual property guidelines. In November 1997, Provost Nancy Cantor appointed Didier as interim director of the entire Academic Outreach program. A few months prior, the Michigan Women's Foundation and Crain's Detroit Business added Didier to a database that helped companies find qualified women for their boards of directors. That led to Didier's October 1997 appointment as a board member of Compuware, a Detroit, Michigan based software company with products aimed at the information technology departments of large businesses. At the time, Compuware had more than US$800 million in sales and earned nearly US$100 million in 1997. Didier's work with the University of Michigan's library information systems gave her a unique perspective that \\"added to Compuware's technology-focused board.\\" In November 1998, Didier was elected as the 1998‚Äì99 vice chair of the Midwest Universities Consortium for International Activities, a Midwestern United States consortium of 10 Big Ten public research universities that collaborates on large-scale projects in developing countries. In addition, the University Continuing Education Association in Washington D.C. appointed Didier that same month to a three-year term on the Learning and Technologies Commission, then one of three national commissions guiding the future directions of providing continuous open and distance education learning opportunities in the United States for adults and non-traditional students. =Beyond the University of Michigan= In July 1999, Didier left the University of Michigan to become dean of Kresge Library at Oakland University, a public university co-founded by Matilda Dodge Wilson and John A. Hannah whose campus is located in central Oakland County, Michigan. In March 2000, Didier was appointed to Oakland University's Information Technology Strategic Planning Task Force, where she developed plans for the University's new Information Technology Institute. About a year later, Didier was elected president of the Michigan Library Association, a United States professional association headquartered in Lansing, Michigan that advocates for libraries in Michigan on behalf of the state's residents. As the representative of the Michigan Library Association, Didier was appointed to the Board of Trustees of the Library of Michigan, Michigan's official state library agency that additionally serves as a historical center. Didier's position as president of the Michigan Library Association expired in 2005. In 2003, Didier was elected chair of the Library of Michigan Board of Trustees. In her capacity as chair of the Library of Michigan board, Didier also served as a member of the Library of Michigan Foundation board of directors. In 2004, Didier was elected to the board of directors of the Association of College and Research Libraries, a division of the American Library Association that serves as a professional association of academic librarians and other interested individuals. In September 2004, Didier was one of three finalists seeking the position of director of the Grand Rapids Public Library system. However, Didier withdrew before the interviews for the public library position after learning that the position of director of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum was available due to the retirement of former director Dennis Daellenbach. Four months later, Didier was named as the director of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum. On the first day of her job, U.S. President Gerald Ford told Didier that, \\"I stand ready to assist you in any way,\\" for which Didier thanked him and asked about the museum's collection of footballs signed by former Ohio State coach Woody Hayes. =At the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum= Didier at the Museum on June 17, 2008 with the three millionth visitor, Cindy Lund. Cindy Lund (in green) was given an autographed copy of President Ford's autobiography. The Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum opened to the public in September 1981. It houses documents, audio-visual materials, and artifacts on the life, career, and presidency of Gerald Ford, the 38th President of the United States. When archivist John W. Carlin selected Didier as director in January 2005, President Ford announced, In singling out Didier's ideas on how to use online technology to expand educational outreach efforts at the library and museum as a main reason for the appointment, the Archivist of the United States noted that Didier was someone with a \\"wealth of experience as a leader in higher education in Michigan and as an executive leader facilitating outreach and alliances in support of learning programs.\\" At the time, Didier wanted to raise the museum's profile, facilitate distance learning and research, and display museum exhibits at the library and make available library resources at the museum, given that the museum and library are located approximately apart. U.S. baseball player Hank Aaron to the White House on October 2, 1975, used in the Ford complex's 2005 \\"Play Ball Mr. President!\\" exhibit. In May 2005, Didier had 4-foot (1.2-meter), blue neon letters installed on the museum to make the museum more visible across the Grand River running next to the museum. Although the sign was about 12 times larger than allowed by the city's zoning ordinance, the museum was exempt from local zoning ordinances as a federal governmental installation. A few months later, Didier oversaw \\"Play Ball Mr. President!,\\" an exhibit at the museum that celebrated ties between U.S. presidents and baseball through a display of more than 75 photographs of presidents playing or otherwise participating in the game. She noted that the exhibit was conceived in connection with an upcoming 2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Comerica Park in Detroit. One photo unearthed from the archives showed President Ford in black tuxedo welcoming U.S. baseball player Hank Aaron to the White House during an October 2, 1975 state dinner for Emperor Hirohito of Japan. In October 2005, Didier spoke at Northwood University about the purpose and functions of presidential libraries and the future of the Ford museum and library complex. In February 2006, Grand Valley State University Didier delivered the keynote address at an event that honored the accomplishments of local women. Didier with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger prior to Kissinger's October 24, 2006 talk at the library In the years 2001 to 2004, just before Didier took over as director at the Ford Presidential Library and Museum, the complex experienced a significant drop in attendance, largely as a result of a 2001 to 2003 remodel. In a 2006 article, Didier addressed the prior 2001 to 2004 low attendance issue and noted it additionally was a result of the struggling local Michigan economy, where people had less money for discretionary spending. In particular, Didier identified tight local school budgets as accounting for the biggest \\"visit-killer,\\" which Didier successfully addressed by getting Italian-American diplomat, businessman, and longtime friend of President Ford Peter Secchia to provide a US$300,000 grant that would cover the busing costs from 2006 to 2011 and allow schools to reinstate field trip programs to the Ford complex. In December 2006, President Gerald Ford died, and Didier commented on Ford's views of the complex, stating, \\"[Ford] wanted both the Library and the Museum to have vibrant educational programs, and he delighted in the thousands of archival research visits made by University of Michigan students and other scholars over the years.\\" She also agreed with Ford's desire that the library and museum be living institutions rather than warehouses preserving documents and artifacts as monuments to Ford. Didier at the Ford Library on March 21, 2006 with Henry Catto, an ambassador of the United States to a variety of countries In 2007, Didier increased the number of public events at the library, including visits by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Charlie Savage, the Washington Post's Bob Woodward, former U.S. ambassador to Britain Henry Catto, former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft, and others in a series of lectures that resulted in increased reference requests at the library. In August 2007, Didier was appointed to a selection panel of judges to choose the official symbol of the 100th anniversary of the Boy Scouts of America. Two months later in October 2007, Didier was filmed in two-hour live broadcast on C-SPAN that featured the 21 million pages of documents and 500,000 audio-visual materials in Gerald Ford's library. In the C-SPAN series, entitled \\"Presidential Libraries: History Uncovered,\\" Didier and supervisory archivist David Horrocks showed off special documents that have been used by researchers like Bob Woodward and artifacts such as Ford's Eagle Scout medal and the Profile in Courage Award he received at the Kennedy Library in 2001. In October 2010, Didier received the University of Michigan Distinguished Alumni Award. The award, given to \\"alumni who have at least 25 years of professional service in the information professions and have made outstanding contributions,\\" honored Didier for her role in introducing a broad agenda that expanded the programs and feature exhibits of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum as well as increased the visibility of the library and museum both locally and nationally. The University also highlighted her work to advance women in leadership roles by participating in organizations such as International Women's Forum and Michigan's Network for Women Leaders. In October 2012, Didier received the Rotary Club's Distinguished Service Award, the club's highest award. Personal Didier lives in Plymouth, Michigan with her husband Gordon, an attorney at the Detroit-based Butzel Long law firm. Didier serves as Assistant Secretary and her husband Gordon serves as Treasurer at St. John's Episcopal Church in Downtown Detroit.

History APAP's story begins in the 1950s when college and university concert managers directed their interests toward the educational role of the arts and the unique issues related to professional performing arts on campus. Fan Taylor, presenter at the Wisconsin Union Theater, became the founder of APAP. The University of Wisconsin in Madison initially housed the staff. During the 1960s and 1970s, the presenting field and membership expanded to a variety of organizations, prompting the association to change its name to the Association of College, University and Community Arts Administrators (ACUCAA) in 1973. By the mid-1980s, colleges and universities no longer dominated the membership, and the association's spectrum expanded. The organization's name was changed to the Association of Performing Arts Presenters in 1988. Fan Taylor led the organization for 24 years. Bill Dawson succeeded Taylor in 1971 and served until 1986, when Susie Farr became the third executive director until her departure in 1999. During her tenure the national office relocated to Washington, D.C. Sandra Gibson served as president and CEO from 2000 until 2011. In October 2011, the board of directors appointed Mario Garcia Durham as president and CEO, the fifth leader of APAP. Membership Membership in the association was 29 in 1957; by 1966 it had increased to 275. Today APAP has 1,600 organizational and individual members and serves more than 5,000 performing arts professionals every year.

They are both founding members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Vanderbilt and Tennessee have played 113 times since 1892. Tennessee leads the all-time series 76‚Äì33‚Äì5. History Tennessee vs. Vanderbilt 2007 From 1892‚Äì1927, Vanderbilt went 19‚Äì2‚Äì3 against Tennessee. Tennessee's hiring of Robert Neyland in 1926 reversed completely the on field rivalry. Nathan Dougherty hired him with the explicit goal to \\"even the score with Vanderbilt.\\" Vanderbilt's Dan McGugin (1904‚Äì17, 1919‚Äì34) was 13‚Äì8‚Äì3 all-time against the Vols. Vanderbilt's longest win streak is 9 from 1901 to 1913. Tennessee's longest win streak is 22 from 1983 to 2004. From 1928 to 2011, Tennessee went 71‚Äì9‚Äì2 against Vanderbilt. But since 2012, Vanderbilt has won five of the last eight. Game resultsNotable games=1892: The rivalry's first two games= 1892 saw the first ever matchup between the Vanderbilt Commodores and the Tennessee Volunteers. The two schools played each other twice during the year; Vanderbilt won both games. On the first matchup; for the Volunteers it was their third ever game in the second season of play and their first season with more than one game. For the Commodores it was their seventh ever game and third season of play. The first game was played in Nashville on October 21, 1892. The Volunteers only managed one score as the Commodores rolled to a 22‚Äì4 victory. The second game was played in Knoxville on November 17. The Vols did not manage a single score as Vanderbilt won 12‚Äì0. The captain of Vanderbilt was Elliott Jones and its quarterback was William E. Beard. =1900: Tie at Vanderbilt jubilee= A game was played between the schools as part of Vanderbilt's celebrations surrounding its 25th anniversary. It ended a scoreless tie. =1902: Edgerton scores= 1902 had one of Tennessee's strongest early elevens. Vanderbilt won 12‚Äì5 despite a weak line due to its running game. John Edgerton scored both Vanderbilt touchdowns. Tennessee's only score was provided by an A. H. Douglas run around right end, breaking two tackles and getting the touchdown. Nash Buckingham had a 40-yard run through the line. Jones Beene blocked and tackled well. =1908: Vandy wins despite Leach= Ray Morrison saved a touchdown in 1908. 1908 was a down year for Vanderbilt with a wealth of sophomores; guided shrewdly by McGugin to its success. The Volunteers had compiled four wins in conference play. It was widely considered the best Tennessee football season up to that point. Vanderbilt won the match between the two schools 16‚Äì9. Walker Leach made a 41-yard field goal to put the Vols up 4‚Äì0. \\"This seemed to arouse the local team\\" and Vanderbilt drove down the field for a touchdown. On a fake kick, Leach circled Vanderbilt's left end for 60 yards. Ray Morrison stopped him short of the goal. Nathan Dougherty was on Tennessee's squad. =1913: Tennessee mistakes help Vanderbilt= Red Rainey scored Tennessee's touchdown. Goat Carroll missed the kick. Tennessee's right guard S. D. Bayer drew a 33-yard, half the distance to the goal penalty for slugging, and was ejected by umpire Bradley Walker. The first down after, Hord Boensch threw a touchdown pass to Enoch Brown. Brown ran the last ten yards shaking off several defenders. Boensch kicked goal and won the game for Vanderbilt. =1914: UT's first victory= In 1914, Tennessee was undefeated Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) champions. It was the first championship of any kind for the Tennessee program. The 1914 Vols were retroactively awarded a national championship by 1st-N-Goal, though this remains largely unrecognized. Alonzo \\"Goat\\" Carroll scored all of Tennessee's points in the 16‚Äì14 victory, Tennessee's first over Vandy. Graham Vowell. An account of the first touchdown reads, \\"Four minutes of play had barely drifted by when Tennessee's weird, mystic, elusive forward pass, May to Carroll, deadly in accuracy, went sailing home for the first touchdown of the game. The chesty Tennessee quarterback sent the oval whizzing for a distance of thirty-five yards and Carroll gathered in the ball near his goal line, when he hurried beneath the posts with all the speed at his command.\\" =1916: UT surprises= Tennessee upset Vanderbilt 10‚Äì6 in 1916. Vanderbilt's lone score came on a 70-yard run by Rabbit Curry. The year's only unanimous All-Southern Graham Vowell scored Tennessee's winning touchdown. Tennessee and Georgia Tech finished the season as conference co-champions. =1918: Berryhill scores six times= In 1918, Vanderbilt beat Tennessee by its largest ever margin; 76‚Äì0. Grailey Berryhill scored six touchdowns.Russell, Fred, and Maxwell Edward Benson. Fifty Years of Vanderbilt Football. Nashville, Tennessee, 1938, p. 36 The Student Army Training Corps represented UT, and so Tennessee does not count the game, however, Vanderbilt does. =1919: A tie in the rain= A steady rain soaked spectators and both squads. The contest ended tied at three. Josh Cody scored on a 30-yard drop kick, while Buck Hatcher made a 25-yard drop kick. =1920: Vanderbilt avenges '16 on Waite Field= In what was expected to be a hard match, the Commodores got vengeance for Curry, who died in aerial combat over France during the First World War, and lost to Tennessee on Waite Field in 1916, by netting a 20 to 0 victory at the Vols' home field. All three of Vandy's touchdowns were owed to passes from Jess Neely to Gink Hendrick. =1921: Kuhn acts as captain= Doc Kuhn. The Vanderbilt Commodores went undefeated in 1921. Vanderbilt played the Tennessee Volunteers on a soggy Old Dudley Field, winning by a score of 14 to 0. Team captain Pink Wade did not play due to a case of lumbago. Acting as the captain in his absence, Doc Kuhn scored all of Vanderbilt's touchdowns. Fatty Lawrence also did not play in the game. Tennessee was excited for the game, preparing for weeks with new plays and persistent drilling. It was said Vanderbilt was \\"the one team that Tennessee enjoys defeating.\\"Volunteer Yearbook 1922, p. 138 During the first quarter, an end run of about 20 yards from Kuhn first made the score 7‚Äì0. In the second, after the Commodores obtained good field position from the punt returns of Rupert Smith, Kuhn had a 30 or 35-yard touchdown run utilizing Lynn Bomar as a lead blocker. At one point in the second half, Freddie \\"Froggie\\" Meiers carried an onside kick over for a touchdown, but it was called back. The Tennessee backs were repeatedly thrown for no gain or losses all game, and steady improvement from the Commodore eleven had been noticed. =1922: Vanderbilt triumphs at Shields‚ÄìWatkins Field= The Vanderbilt Commodores were undefeated conference champions in the first year of the Southern Conference. The Commodores beat Tennessee at Knoxville by a score of 14 to 6. The eighteenth meeting between Vanderbilt and Tennessee saw a packed stadium, the largest crowd of the season for Shields‚ÄìWatkins Field.\\"Vanderbilt Wins From Volunteers.\\" The State [Columbia, South Carolina] November 5, 1922: 11. It was Vanderbilt's first game at the new stadium, which opened September 24, 1921. Roe Campbell. Tennessee was out for revenge, as they had only beaten the Commodores twice, and Vanderbilt was ahead in points scored in the series by a vast margin, 347 to 53. Tennessee also hoped to better its Southern Conference record after having lost to Georgia. Both teams had last week rested their starters, Vanderbilt winning over Mercer, and Tennessee beating Mississippi by a score of 49 to 0. It was therefore thought the game should be a closer one than in years past, with Vanderbilt only slight favorites.\\"Hard Contests Are Scheduled\\" The Lexington Herald November 6, 1922: 3. The game turned out to be hotly contested, so much so that many felt Vanderbilt was outplayed but not outfought. Perhaps the week off for many Commodore starters had hindered Vanderbilt's ability to play its best. Tennessee drove down to the 7-yard line in the first quarter, but was held on downs. The first score came from Vanderbilt in the second quarter on a 31-yard touchdown pass from Jess Neely to Doc Kuhn. Wakefield kicked goal. In the fourth quarter, Tennessee got to the 1-yard line after a series of long passes. Tennessee fullback Roe Campbell charged over the line for the touchdown. The Volunteers' Clayton failed to kick goal. Later in the fourth, Vanderbilt intercepted a Tennessee pass in Volunteer territory, leading to a chance to score. After runs at the line failed, a 5-yard pass from Neely to Lynn Bomar got the touchdown. Hek Wakefield's try was successful.The Volunteer Yearbook (1923) p. 110‚Äì111 Lynn Bomar, Scotty Neill, Gil Reese, and Fatty Lawrence were mentioned as the players of the game for the Commodores, and Campbell was cited as the star for the Volunteers. It was said Neill out-punted the Volunteers on nearly every occasion.\\"Tennessee Fights Hard, but Loses to Vanderbilt.\\" The Montgomery Advertiser November 5, 1922: 11. The Nashville Banner said Lawrence had been \\"in there doing a man's job blocking a kick and tackling with the deadliness of a tiger unleashed in a cave of lions.\\" =1923: Vanderbilt unleashes pent up fury= Gil Reese. After two undefeated seasons and a scoreless tie with Michigan, hopes were high going into the 1923 season. Michigan this year were national champions and edged out the Commodores 3‚Äì0. Vanderbilt then was upset by Texas. The week before the Tennessee game, Vanderbilt suffered a scoreless tie with Mississippi A&M; in the rain. With a 51‚Äì7 victory over the Tennessee Volunteers the next week, the Commodores regained \\"all the power and smoothness with which it had started the 1923 season.\\" Ralph McGill reflected the sentiment, \\"All the pent-up fury of misunderstanding and disappointment burst out like a flood. The Vols might as well have flung themselves in the way of a runaway train. It was a machine that found itself. The power was there and the Commodores took a fierce joy in using it.\\" The Volunteers were led by M. B. Banks, in his third year as head coach. Vanderbilt gained 455 yards of total offense. Gil Reese rushed for 214 yards, as well as 95 yards on punt returns. Reese scored five times, with touchdown runs of 70 yards, 45 yards, and 29 yards respectively. Red Rountree scored another, a 63-yard run. Captain Doc Kuhn got the other touchdown, and Wakefield made a drop kick. Lynn Bomar, Alf Sharpe, and Bob Rives on defense helped hold the Volunteers to only 7. With the win Vanderbilt was still a contender for the Southern title. J. G. Lowe played best for Tennessee, getting its lone touchdown. =1927: Dodson gets Neyland a tie= Coach Neyland. In 1927, two hall of fame coaches without a conference loss battle to a tie. Robert Neyland was hired to coach Tennessee in 1926 by Nathan Dougherty with the explicit goal to \\"even the score with Vanderbilt.\\" 1927 is his first great team, tying with others as victors of the Southern Conference. Dan McGugin's Commodores led 7‚Äì0 until a late Dick Dodson run tied the score. \\"After the game McGugin questioned each of his players as to his whereabouts during the run. Without exception the players claimed that two men had blocked them. McGugin shrugged. \\"Well, we'll just protest the play. It's perfectly obvious that Tennessee had twenty-two men on the field.\\" =1928: Vols pass to victory= Tennessee remained undefeated on the season with a 6‚Äì0 victory over Vanderbilt; its first win in the series since 1916. Before 1928, Vanderbilt held a strong advantage over the Volunteers with a record of 18‚Äì2‚Äì3. Since 1928, Tennessee has dominated the rivalry. The crowd of 22,000 was the largest ever to see a game in Tennessee up to that point. A 16-yard pass from Roy Witt to Paul Hug in the second quarter was the lone score of the contest. Jimmy Armistead ran all over Tennessee, once stopped short of the goal by Witt. Buddy Hackman provided strong defense against the forward pass. =1932: A scoreless tie= Clyde Roberts outrushed Beattie Feathers as the SoCon champion Vols tied the Commodores 0‚Äì0. The game's lone scoring play was a catch by Feathers, called out of bounds in front of the Vanderbilt bench. =2005: Cutler ends Vols' longest win streak= The Commodores ended their season, and Jay Cutler's Vanderbilt career, at Tennessee against the Tennessee Volunteers with a 28‚Äì24 win. The victory was Vanderbilt's first over the Volunteers since 1982, the year before Cutler was born. The win also marked Vanderbilt's first victory over Tennessee on the Volunteers' home field in Knoxville since 1975. Cutler passed for three touchdowns and 315 yards during the game, becoming the first quarterback in school history to record four consecutive 300-yard passing performances. Cutler's final play in college was the game-winning (and streak-ending) touchdown pass to teammate Earl Bennett against Tennessee. =2015: Tennessee finishes with best record since '07= In the 110th meeting between Vanderbilt and Volunteers, Tennessee, who had some heartbreaking losses and blew leads in big games, ended the season on a high note, finishing with their best record since 2007, when they went 10‚Äì4. The Volunteers defeated instate rival, 53‚Äì28. The Volunteers had 523 total yards, but they also surrendered 411 yards to Vanderbilt. It was the 2nd straight win for Tennessee over Vanderbilt, extending their lead in the series 75‚Äì30‚Äì5. =2016: Commodores spoil Volunteer Sugar Bowl hopes= Just one year later, the Vols would fall to a 6‚Äì6 Vanderbilt team 45‚Äì34. Vanderbilt outscored Tennessee 21‚Äì3 in the second half to spoil the Sugar Bowl hopes of the Vols. The 45 points scored for the Commodores was their most against Tennessee since the 1923 meeting. Ralph Webb would overtake Zac Stacy's career rushing record and Kyle Shurmur would go on to throw for 416 yards. Josh Dobbs would go 31‚Äì34 for 340 yards with 2 TDs, but a late 3rd quarter fumble shifted momentum in the Commodores' favor. Derek Barnett tied Reggie White for the Volunteer career sack record, which stands at 32. =2017: Worst SEC game in 50 years?= The 2017 edition pitted two 4‚Äì7 teams, each seeking their first conference win in the finale. One commentator suggested that \\"statistically speaking\\" the game might be \\"the worst Southeastern Conference matchup of the last 50 years,\\" based on an analysis of each team's margin of victory in SEC play to that point.Chris Lee, VandySports.com. https://vanderbilt.rivals.com/news/the-3-2-1-tennessee-week Vanderbilt broke the game open with three fourth-quarter touchdowns to prevail, 42‚Äì24. =2019: Volunteers end three game losing streak to Vanderbilt= Tennessee ended a three game losing streak to Vanderbilt 28‚Äì10 on a stormy evening in Knoxville. True freshman running back Eric Gray rushed for 246 yards on 25 carries and had three rushing touchdowns. Gray had the fifth-highest single-game rushing total ever by a Tennessee player. Tennessee finished the regular season 7‚Äì5 and 5‚Äì3 in conference play.

Suharto was born in a small village, Kemusuk, in the Godean area near Yogyakarta, during the Dutch colonial era.Soeharto, as related to G. Dwipayana and Ramadhan K.H. (1989), Soeharto: Pikiran, ucapan dan tindakan saya: otobiographi (Soeharto: My thoughts, words and deeds: an autobiography), PT Citra Lamtoro Gung Persada, Jakarta. . He grew up in humble circumstances.See the details in Chapter 2, 'Akar saya dari desa' (My village roots), in Soeharto, op. cit. His Javanese Muslim parents divorced not long after his birth, and he was passed between foster parents for much of his childhood. During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, Suharto served in Japanese-organised Indonesian security forces. Indonesia's independence struggle saw him joining the newly formed Indonesian army. Suharto rose to the rank of major general following Indonesian independence. Early life Suharto was born on 8 June 1921 during the Dutch East Indies era, in a plaited bamboo walled house in the hamlet of Kemusuk, a part of the larger village of Godean. The village is west of Yogyakarta, the cultural heartland of the Javanese. Born to ethnic Javanese parents of peasant class, he was the only child of his father's second marriage. His father, Kertosudiro had two children from his previous marriage, and was a village irrigation official. His mother Sukirah, a local woman, was distantly related to Sultan Hamengkubuwono V by his first concubine.Tempo (Jakarta), 11 November 1974. Official portrait of Suharto and First Lady Siti Hartinah Five weeks after Suharto's birth, his mother suffered a nervous breakdown and he was placed in the care of his paternal great-aunt, Kromodirjo. Kertosudiro and Sukirah divorced early in Suharto's life and both later remarried. At the age of three, Suharto was returned to his mother who had remarried a local farmer whom Suharto helped in the rice paddies. In 1929, Suharto's father took him to live with his sister who was married to an agricultural supervisor, Prawirowihardjo, in the town of Wuryantoro in a poor and low-yield farming area near Wonogiri. Over the following two years, he was taken back to his mother in Kemusuk by his stepfather and then back again to Wuryantoro by his father. Prawirowihardjo took to raising the boy as his own, which provided Suharto a father-figure and a stable home in Wuryantoro. In 1931, he moved to town of Wonogiri to attend the primary school (schakelschool), living first with Prawirohardjo's son Sulardi, and later with his father's relative Hardjowijono. While living with Hardjowijono, Suharto became acquinted with Darjatmo, a dukun (\\"guru\\") of Javanese mystical arts and faith healing. The experience deeply affected him and later, as president, Suharto surrounded himself with powerful symbolic language. Difficulties in paying the fees for his education in Wonogiri resulted in another move back with his father in Kemusuk, where he continued studying at a lower-fee Muhammadiyah middle school in the city of Yogyakarta until 1939. Like many Javanese, Suharto had only one name.Haskin, Colin, \\"Suharto dead at 86\\", The Globe and Mail, 27 January 2008 In religious contexts in recent years he has sometimes been called ‚ÄúHaji‚Äù or ‚Äúel-Haj Mohammed Suharto‚Äù but these names were not part of his formal name or generally used. The spelling \\"Suharto\\" reflects modern Indonesian spelling although the general approach in Indonesia is to rely on the spelling preferred by the person concerned. At the time of his birth, the standard transcription was \\"Soeharto\\" and he preferred the original spelling. The international English-language press generally uses the spelling 'Suharto' while the Indonesian government and media use 'Soeharto'. Suharto's upbringing contrasts with that of leading Indonesian nationalists such as Sukarno in that he is believed to have had little interest in anti-colonialism, or political concerns beyond his immediate surroundings. Unlike Sukarno and his circle, Suharto had little to no contact with European colonizers. Consequently, he did not learn to speak Dutch or other European languages in his youth. He learned to speak Dutch after his induction into the Dutch military in 1940. Military career=World War II and Japanese occupation= Suharto finished middle school at the age of 18 and took a clerical job at a bank in Wuryantaro. He was forced to resign after a bicycle mishap tore his only working clothes. Following a spell of unemployment, he joined the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) in June 1940, and undertook basic training in Gombong near Yogyakarta. With the Netherlands under German occupation and the Japanese pressing for access to Indonesian oil supplies, the Dutch had opened up the KNIL to large intakes of previously excluded Javanese. Suharto was assigned to Battalion XIII at Rampal, graduated from short training at KNIL Kaderschool in Gombong to become sergeant, and was posted to KNIL reserve battalion in Cisarua. Following the Dutch surrender to the invading Japanese forces in March 1942, Suharto abandoned his KNIL uniform and went back to Wurjantoro. After months of unemployment, he then became one of thousands of Indonesians who took the opportunity to join Japanese-organised security forces by joining the Yogyakarta police force. In October 1943, Suharto was transferred from the police force to the newly formed Japanese-sponsored militia, the PETA (Defenders of the Fatherland) in which Indonesians served as officers. In his training to serve at the rank of shodancho (platoon commander) he encountered a localised version of the Japanese bushido, or \\"way of the warrior\\", used to indoctrinate troops. This training encouraged an anti-Dutch and pro-nationalist thought, although toward the aims of the Imperial Japanese militarists. The encounter with a nationalistic and militarist ideology is believed to have profoundly influenced Suharto's own way of thinking. Suharto was posted at a PETA coastal defence battalion at Wates, south of Yogyakarta, until he was admitted for training for company commander (chudancho) in Bogor from April to August 1944. As company commander, he conducted training for new PETA recruits in Surakarta, Jakarta, and Madiun. The Japanese surrender and Proclamation of Indonesian Independence in August 1945 occurred when Suharto was posted at remote Brebeg area (on the slopes of Mount Wilis) to train new NCOs to replace those executed by the Japanese in the aftermath of failed PETA rebellion of February 1945 in Blitar, led by Supriyadi. =Indonesian National Revolution= Two days after the Japanese surrender in the Pacific, independence leaders Sukarno and Hatta declared Indonesian independence, and were appointed president and vice- President respectively of the new Republic. Suharto disbanded his regiment in accordance with orders from the Japanese command and returned to Yogyakarta. As republican groups rose to assert Indonesian independence, Suharto helped to establish a fighting unit together with a former PETA colleague, Umar Slamet. This unit was amalgamated into the newly formed Indonesian armed forces (Tentara Keamanan Rakjat / TKR) which was established on 5 October 1945. His leadership skills in leading several attacks against Japanese soldiers in Yogyakarta area to seize their weapons led to Suharto's promotion to major. He was given command of newly formed Battalion X of Regiment I, which was in turn part of Division IX led by Colonel Sudarsono. By October 1945, this division has secured full control of Yogyakarta area by forcing the surrender of remaining Japanese soldiers. The arrival of the Allies, under a mandate to return the situation to the status quo ante bellum, quickly led to clashes between Indonesian republicans and Allied forces, namely returning Dutch and assisting British forces. Suharto led his Battalion X when it was sent northwards to repel the British advance towards Yogyakarta from British- occupied port of Semarang. In a series of battles at Magelang and Ambarawa lasting from late-October to December 1945, Republican forces forced the British regroup at the confines of Semarang. Suharto's battle performance attracted attention of Sudirman, the Republican armed forces commander, who promoted him to lead newly formed Regiment III of Division IX (2,250 men) with rank of lieutenant-colonel on early 1946. In May 1946, Suharto's umbrella Division IX was amalgamated into new Division III under leadership of newly promoted Major-General Sudarsono. On 17 May 1946, the British handed-over control of Semarang to the Dutch T (\\"Tijger\\") Brigade. Suharto participated in a battle at Kendal where Division III successfully halted a southward advance by the Dutch brigade. As evidence of Suharto's increasing stature, in June 1946 Lieutenant-Colonel Sunarto Kusumodirdjo invited him to draft the working guidelines for the Battle Leadership Headquarters (MPP), a body created to organise and unify the command structure of the Indonesian nationalist forces. The transfer of Republican capital from Jakarta to Yogyakarta in January 1946 exposed the armed units there to civilian political intrigue, most notably the \\"3 July Affair\\". Sukarno government's decision to commence negotiations with the Dutch caused much opposition from various Indonesian factions, which coalesced into a group called PP (Persatoean Perdjoangan) led by communist politician Tan Malaka. PP's opposition to negotiation with the Dutch received sympathy from many sections of the armed forces, including its commander Sudirman and Suharto's direct superior Major-General Sudarsono. On 27 June 1946, Sudarsono ordered the kidnapping of Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir who was leading the negotiations with the Dutch. When Sukarno issued order for Sudarsono's arrest, the plot leader took refuge in Suharto's regimental headquarters at the outskirts of Yogyakarta, bringing the kidnapped Sjahrir with him. Suharto, while providing protection to his superior Sudarsono, was also secretly in contact with Sudirman to find-out whether the commander decided to support Sudarsono's kidnapping plot. When Sudirman indicated that Sukarno has convinced him not to support Sudarsono, Suharto helped loyal government forces to arrest Sudarsono and release the kidnapped Sjahrir on 3 July 1946, hence protecting himself from the subsequent purge of Division III in the aftermath of the affair. The 3 July Affair led to further restructuring of Division III. By August 1946, Suharto was head of Yogyakarta-based 22nd Regiment, one of the six regiments of Division III (now named the \\"Diponegoro Division\\") which is responsible for the Central Java area. According to Dutch intelligence reports, by mid-1947, Suharto's regiment consisted of four battalions who were regularly rotated northwards to the frontlines surrounding Semarang to help contain the Dutch forces there. Dutch intelligence reported that Suharto was assisting smuggling syndicates in the transport of opium through the territory he controlled with the help of Chinese-Indonesian merchant Liem Sioe Liong to be bartered with weapons, clothes, food, and other supplies. Lieutenant Colonel Suharto in 1947 On 21 July 1947, the Dutch launched Operatie Product, a military invasion into Republican-held areas. In Central Java, the Dutch T-Brigade pushed the Republican forces from Semarang to Magelang before a United Nations-brokered ceasefire was announced on 4 August. Suharto led his troops in the defence against this assault, and later was regularly rotated as frontline commander responsible for guarding the ceasefire line (Van Mook Line) north of Yogyakarta. On 26 December 1947, Suharto married Siti Hartinah (known as Madam Tien), the daughter of a minor noble in the Mangkunegaran royal house of Solo. The arranged marriage was enduring and supportive, lasting until Tien's death in 1996. The couple had six children: Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana (Tutut, born 1949), Sigit Harjojudanto (born 1951), Bambang Trihatmodjo (born 1953), Siti Hediati (Titiek, born 1959), Hutomo Mandala Putra (Tommy, born 1962), and Siti Hutami Endang Adiningish (Mamiek, born 1964). The signing of highly disadvantageous Renville Agreement in January 1948 resulted in evacuation of 35,000 Republican fighters from the Dutch-occupied side of the ceasefire line into the shrunk Republican- controlled territory. To control the unwieldy myriad of armed groups proliferating the Republican areas, Prime Minister Mohammad Hatta undertook rationalisation of the armed forces. In April 1948, Division III (\\"Diponegoro Division\\") was reduced from 16,000 to 7,000 men. Suharto was reshuffled as commander of Brigade III of the Division III, commanding four battalions. The unpopular rationalisation policies met often bloody resistance from many factions of the Republican forces, which again coalesced around the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) under the leadership of Musso who recently returned from the Soviet Union. On late-September 1948, PKI-linked armed units seized control of Madiun in East Java and declared a \\"Soviet Republic of Indonesia\\" in opposition of Sukarno and Hatta. On 22 September, Republican commander Sudirman sent Suharto to communist-occupied Madiun to meet Musso in an unsuccessful attempt to reach a peaceful reconciliation. On 30 September, loyal troops launched assault on Madiun, which resulted in the killing of Musso and total defeat of the rebels by end-October 1948. Suharto's brigade participated in anti-communist operations in the areas east of Yogyakarta. On 19 December 1948, to take advantage of the Republic's weak situation following the communist rebellion, the Dutch launched Operatie Kraai, designed to destroy the Republic once and for all. This invasion, initiated with an airborne assault on Yogyakarta, resulted in the capture of Sukarno, Hatta, and other Republican civilian leaders. Meanwhile, the Republican army was forced into the countryside to wage guerrilla resistance inline with Sudirman's Wehrkreise strategy. Suharto, leaving his pregnant wife behind in Dutch- occupied Yogyakarta, led guerrilla operations from the rural areas south of the city. On 28 December 1948, Division III commander Colonel Bambang Soegeng divided Central Java into three defence areas (\\"Wehrkreise\\"). Suharto was appointed to command Wehrkreise III, consisting of two battalions operating in the areas surrounding Yogyakarta, with its headquarters at the Menorah hills in Bantul area. From January to February 1949, the Dutch T-Brigade incurred losses of 44 dead and 129 wounded from guerrilla attacks in areas under Suharto's control. In dawn raids on 1 March 1949, Suharto's forces and local militia re-captured large parts of Yogyakarta city, holding it until noon. Suharto's later accounts had him as the lone plotter, although other sources say Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX of Yogyakarta and the Division III commander ordered the attack. However, General Nasution said that Suharto took great care in preparing the \\"General Offensive\\" (Indonesian Serangan Umum). The attack proved that the Dutch was very far from winning the guerrilla war. International opinion condemned the Dutch violation over internationally brokered Renville Agreement, with the United States and United Nations Security Council pressured the Dutch to cease the military offensive and to re-commence negotiations. These pressures resulted in Roem‚ÄìVan Roijen Agreement of 7 May 1949, whereby the Dutch agreed to release captured Republican leaders and return area surrounding Yogyakarta to Republican control in exchange of ceasefire. Suharto was responsible for the take-over of Yogyakarta city from the withdrawing Dutch forces on 29 June 1949. On 9 July 1949, Suharto led the welcoming parade for recently released Republican leaders (including Sukarno and Hatta) to Yogyakarta while the following day he led similar parade for tuberculosis-ridden Sudirman back into the city from his rural guerrilla base. On 27 December 1949, the Dutch surrendered sovereignty to the United States of Indonesia. = Post-Independence military career = Suharto with his wife and six children in 1967 By 1950, Suharto served as commander of Brigade X (\\"Garuda Mataram Brigade\\") of Diponegoro Division, consisting of four battalions of around 800 men each. In April 1950, Suharto led this brigade to Makassar as part of expeditionary force to suppress a rebellion of former KNIL supporters of the Dutch-established State of East Indonesia led by Andi Azis (Makassar Uprising). During his stay in Makassar, Suharto became acquainted with his neighbours the Habibie family, whose eldest son B. J. Habibie would later become Suharto's vice-president and went on to succeed him as president. Suharto's brigade later engaged in the difficult mission of disarming and integrating both former KNIL soldiers and former pro-Republican guerillas into the army. His brigade defeated an unruly former guerrilla unit under Arief Rate (who was killed) and hostile former KNIL soldiers in heavy urban combat in Makassar city centre during June 1950, losing seventeen men killed in action. Suharto and his brigade returned to Central Java in September 1950 with the successful dissolution of State of East Indonesia into newly formed Unitary Republic of Indonesia. In November 1951, Suharto was appointed to lead enlarged Pragola Brigade (consisting of nine battalions) based in Salatiga. In December 1951, one of Suharto's battalions (Battalion 426) which consisted of former Islamic militias, rebelled in support of ongoing Darul Islam insurgency in West Java. From late- December 1951 to late-January 1952, Suharto led \\"Operasi Merdeka Timur V\\" which successfully defeated the rebellious battalion in vicious fighting in Klaten area. Remnants of Battalion 426 joined Darul Islam insurgents operating in northwestern part of Central Java which were only defeated in 1957. In March 1953, Suharto was appointed commander of Infantry Regiment III consisting of four battalions (3,704 men) based in Surakarta, organizing its participation in battling Darul Islam insurgents in northwestern Central Java and anti-bandit operations in Mount Merapi area. He also sought to stem pervasive leftist sympathies amongst his troops (one of his leftist-leaning subordinates in this period was Untung bin Sjamsuri who would later lead the 30 September Movement in 1965). His experience in this period left Suharto with deep distaste for both Islamic and communist radicalism which he believed could be countered only with material and financial sufficiency on the part of the people. On 3 September 1956 Suharto was promoted to command the Diponegoro Division with the rank of colonel, based in Semarang and responsible for Central Java and Yogyakarta provinces. Upon a series of anti-Jakarta \\"regional coups\\" by military commanders in Sumatera and Sulawesi islands, and the subsequent declaration of martial law (Staat van Oorlog en Beleg) by President Sukarno in March 1957, Suharto became regional martial law administrator for the two provinces. With wide-ranging power over civilian affairs in his hands, Suharto began organizing various fund-raising activities to finance his poorly paid troops under the coordination of the division's \\"finance and economic office\\". Developing on the fund-raising tactics he used during the revolutionary war, Suharto established charitable organizations (\\"jajasan\\") which would receive \\"donations\\" from all enterprises operating in the provinces as well as levying \\"unofficial tax\\" on provision of goods and services. With the aid of ethnic-Chinese businessmen such as Bob Hasan, Suharto organized bartering of sugar and copra to Singapore in exchange with much-needed food supplies. By 1959, Suharto's jajasans had acquired capital of Rp 75,750,800 (equivalent to 1959 US$1,683,351 and a current value of US$13.3 million). The defeat of the PRRI-Permesta rebellions (in which Suharto's divisional soldiers were heavily involved) was followed by President Sukarno's decree of 5 July 1959 concentrating power at the president. As part of re- assertion of central government control, army chief General Abdul Haris Nasution launched a nationwide crackdown on regional military corruption, including Suharto's commercial activities in Central Java. In July 1959, Nasution sent army internal audit chief Brigadier-General Sungkono to audit financial dealings of Diponegoro Division. The investigation found that while some of the proceeds from Suharto's jajasans were used for charitable purposes, most of the money raised could not be accounted for responsibly. On 1 November 1959, Suharto was removed from his divisional command and was instructed to attend army staff and command training (SSKAD, now SESKOAD) in Bandung. Despite this setback, Suharto's past services and strong backers meant that his future career remained undisturbed. While in Bandung he was promoted to brigadier-general in January 1960. Suharto graduated from SSKAD in December 1960 with a thesis on greater military role in political, economic, and social development of Indonesia. He was then appointed as operational deputy to army chief-of-staff based in Jakarta. In March 1961, he was given an additional command, as head of the army's new general reserve force called Tjadangan Umum Angkatan Darat / TJADUAD (later renamed Komando Strategis Angkatan Darat / KOSTRAD), a ready-reaction air-mobile force. Additionally, he was appointed to lead the new army air-defence command (Komando Pertahanan Udara Angkatan Darat / KOHANUDAD) in October 1961. On 9 January 1962, Suharto was promoted to the rank of major-general and appointed to lead Mandala Command, a joint army-navy-air force command of 42,000 soldiers formed the organize the military aspect of the campaign to win Netherlands New Guinea (whom Indonesians referred to as \\"West Irian\\"), from the Dutch who were preparing it for independence outside of Indonesia, contrary to the provisions of Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference of 1949. His position as Mandala commander, based in Makassar, provided martial-law power over Sulawesi, Maluku Islands, and Lesser Sunda Islands covering 5 million square kilometres. Suharto organized infiltration of around 3,000 Indonesian soldiers into the disputed territory by air and sea, although these infiltrators were mostly dropped deep in the jungle with no effect on Dutch control over population centers. With massive Soviet armaments and even manpower aid, Suharto formulated a highly risky plan to invade and capture Dutch military headquarters in Biak using 25,000 soldiers in an airborne and amphibious operation code-named Operasi Djajawidjaja set for 15 August 1962. However, Suharto received orders to abort the operation while he was already in-place at advanced headquarters in Peleng island, off Sulawesi. On 15 August, under heavy American pressure, the Dutch signed the New York Agreement whereby control over West Irian was relinquished to UNTEA (United National Temporary Executive Authority) in October 1962. On 1 May 1963, UNTEA handed-control of the territory to Indonesia. On that day, Suharto led a \\"victory parade\\" of Indonesian soldiers in front of President Sukarno at West Irian's capital Sukarnapura (formerly Hollandia, now Jayapura). After the disbandment of Mandala Command in May 1963, Suharto returned to Jakarta to his post as KOSTRAD (formerly TJADUAD) commander. As evidence of his seniority, he was appointed as deputy head of army advisory board on senior-level promotions (WANDJAKTI) in July 1963. Again showing his penchant for commercial dealings, Suharto used his KOSTRAD command to establish several jajasans which ostensibly functioned to raise funds to cover KOSTRAD's operational needs. In April 1964, Suharto established Jajasan Darma Putra, which over-time acquired shares in raft of businesses from transportation, banking, and manufacturing sectors (such as Mandala Airlines and Bank Windu Kentjana). During this period, Sukarno gradually shifted the country to the left by promoting the growth of Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) in order to counter the power of the military within his Guided Democracy system. In May 1964, Sukarno declared military confrontation against newly formed Malaysia, with the stated objective of establishing \\"State of North Kalimantan\\" under leadership of North Kalimantan Communist Party. To organize the military aspect of this confrontation, Sukarno formed the Vigilance Command (Komando Siaga / KOGA) commanded by air force commander Omar Dhani. In October 1964, KOGA was transformed into Vigilance Mandala Command (Komando Mandala Siaga / KOLAGA) with wide-ranging martial law powers over the islands of Sumatera and Kalimantan which borders Malaysia. Dhani remained as KOLAGA commander, while Suharto was appointed as KOLAGA first deputy with authority over operational affairs. KOLAGA organized infiltration of Indonesian soldiers and volunteers (as well as Malaysian communists) into Malaysia where they engaged in jungle warfare with British and Commonwealth soldiers deployed to protect the nascent Malaysia. While publicly supportive of Sukarno's confrontation policy, the army leadership was very reluctant to commit to the military confrontation against Malaysia, which they considered to benefit only the PKI at expense of the military. Additionally, the army was slighted by appointment of airforce commander Dhani, a known communist sympathiser, as KOLAGA commander. Army chief Lieutenant-General Ahmad Yani and Suharto ensured that the best-prepared troops and vital supplies remained in Java to ensure no escalation of the conflict. This strategy was supported by army commander in North Sumatera, Colonel Kemal Idris, who was an avowed anti-communist. However, the army commander in Kalimantan, Brigadier-General Mustafa Sjarif Supardjo, was a committed communist sympathiser who strongly resented the army headquarters' barely disguised sabotage policy. He would later become a key participant in the 30 September Movement against top army leadership. Unlike Yani who barely disguised his disapproval of confrontation policy, Suharto managed to maintain his public appearance as enthusiastic supporter of Sukarno's anti-Malaysian policies. In August 1964, Suharto authorised KOSTRAD's intelligence officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Ali Murtopo, to send several officers (including future Armed Forces chief Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani) to spread secret peace-feelers to the Malaysian government. Suharto's position in KOLAGA also provided him with more sinister commercial opportunity in organizing the smuggling of rubber, timber, and other primary products from North Sumatera to Malaysia using ethnic-Chinese fishermen.

In case of a hung jury during the penalty phase of the trial, a retrial happens before another jury. If the second jury is also deadlocked, a life sentence is issued. The Governor of Arizona can grant clemency only with advice and consent of the five-member Arizona Board of Executive Clemency.  Capital crimes  The following aggravating circumstances constitute capital murder in the State of Arizona: # prior conviction for which a sentence of life imprisonment or death was imposable; # prior serious offense involving the use or threat of violence; # grave risk of death to others; # procurement of murder by payment or promise of payment; #commission of murder for pecuniary gain; # murder committed in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner; # murder committed while in custody; # multiple homicides; # murder of a victim under 15 years of age or of a victim 70 years of age or older; and # murder of a law enforcement officer.  Executions and death row  The method of execution employed in Arizona is lethal injection.

Set against the backdrop of the political violence that rocked India, and West Bengal in particular, in the late 1960s, it tells the story of an aged widow in a village who goes to Calcutta to stay with relatives, but faces only exploitation. She moves to a slum, and finds her \\"own people\\" in a group of educated, unemployed youth, who are caught up inexorably in the prevalent violence. The film was a commercial success, and also won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Bengali, as well as several BFJA Awards. In 1971, it was remade in Hindi as Mere Apne by Gulzar and in 1984, in Kannada as Benki Birugali.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bengali/movies/news/remakes- of-bengali-films-whats-new-in-this-trend/articleshow/72241437.cms Plot Anandamoyee (Chhaya Devi) is a childless widow in a Bengal village. One day a man turns up, claiming to be her nephew. He takes her to live with him and his family in Calcutta. In the city, she experiences something akin to culture shock, as she encounters children begging on the streets and day-to-day violence. She finds the idea of women working at office jobs very strange, and even wearing any kind of footwear is new for her. The couple with whom she lives want her to look after their child, which she does gladly since they are her \\"own people\\". However, eventually she realises that she is being exploited as an unpaid nanny. She moves out to a downbeat area of the city, to look after two street children. They are part of the 'family' of Robi (Swaroop Dutta), the leader of a gang of educated young men who are active participants in the street violence that engulfs the city. With these outsiders, Anandamoyee feels a sort of kinship, and even a sense of being in a family, which she never enjoyed with her actor husband. Robi's gang is always at daggers drawn with a rival gang led by Chheno (Samit Bhanja). The two gangs are enlisted by cynical politicians, to serve their own ends. The gang war continues, albeit with an ostensibly political colour, reaching a melodramatic climax, with a tragic resolution. Cast * Chhaya Devi as Anandamoyee * Swarup Dutta as Robi * Samit Bhanja as Chheno * Rabi Ghosh * Sumita Sanyal * Juin Banerjee * Chinmoy Roy as Anandamoyee's husband * Bhanu Bandopadhyay Reception Apanjan was the first film to deal with contemporary political violence and urban angst in West Bengal, and indeed India. It was a good two years ahead of better known films that dealt with urban issues, such as Satyajit Ray's Pratidwandi and Mrinal Sen's Interview. When it was released in 1968, it struck a chord with urban audiences, and was a commercial success. It gave a boost to the careers of Swaroop Dutta and Samit Bhanja, catapulting the latter to stardom. The use of Rabindrasangeet in the film was unusual, and added to its popularity with middle-class audiences. Critically, too, the film was well received at the time. It dominated the 1969 BFJA Awards, besides winning the National Award for Best Feature Film in Bengali. Three years later, Tapan Sinha returned to the problems faced by urban youth in Ekhoni, which was also well received.  Preservation  Apanjan has been restored and digitised by the National Film Archive of India. Remake In 1971, Gulzar made his directorial debut with Mere Apne, which was almost a frame by frame remake of Apanjan. It starred Meena Kumari in the lead role which was successful at Box office.

He is a Winthrop Professor at the University of Western Australia, an infectious diseases consultant at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, and an Honorary Distinguished Research Fellow of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. Carapetis is the Director of the Telethon Kids Institute in Perth, Western Australia. He is a medical practitioner, specialist paediatric physician, infectious diseases physician, and a public health physician. Early life and background Carapetis was born in Port Pirie, South Australia. He moved to Washington DC in the mid-1970s where he lived for four years while his father worked as a civil engineer for the World Bank in Africa. It was during frequent visits to Africa to see his father that Carapetis developed an awareness and understanding of other cultures and governments. The majority of his high school years were spent at an International school in the US completing the International Baccalaureate before he returned to Australia to study medicine at the University of Melbourne. He spent many of his university holidays flying back to Africa to spend time with his father and it was in Tanzania where he conducted his university related practical medical elective, immersing himself in a local community near Mt Kilimanjaro. It was here Carapetis developed an interest in child health and saw first-hand the challenges facing families struggling with poverty and with major health crises such as the onset of HIV, malaria, pneumonia and malnutrition. Career Carapetis undertook his internship and initial postgraduate medical training at the Royal Melbourne Hospital and at the Royal Children‚Äôs Hospital, Melbourne between 1987 and 1992 (interspersed with a year of traveling in 1990). He then worked as Chief Resident and Fellow in Infectious Diseases at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne, as part of his specialisation training in paediatrics. In 1994 he conducted doctoral studies at the Menzies School of Health Research, Charles Darwin University, into group A streptococcal diseases in the Aboriginal population. This work translated into important public health interventions, including the establishment of Australia's first rheumatic heart disease control program in the north of Australia. He also worked as a paediatrician at Royal Darwin Hospital. Carapetis was awarded a PhD by the University of Sydney for his thesis: Ending the heartache; the epidemiology and control of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease in the Top End of the Northern Territory. After a year spent working overseas as a Paediatric Infectious Diseases Fellow in Canada, Carapetis returned to Australia in 1999 where he was instrumental in setting up the Centre for International Child Health at the University of Melbourne. There he spent a lot of his time focusing on child health in developing countries and led some ground-breaking work in the development of affordable and effective vaccines to help children in both Fiji and Vietnam. During this time in Melbourne Carapetis was also a Theme Director at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and Consultant in Paediatric Infectious Diseases at Royal Children‚Äôs Hospital. In 2006 returned to Darwin where he had spent time in the mid-1990s to further his work in child health research with a particular focus on indigenous health. He held the position of Director of the Menzies School of Health Research from 2006 until June 2012. During the six years that Carapetis headed Menzies, funding was boosted by 20 million per annum, the school more than doubled in size, and Menzies developed a reputation as Australia‚Äôs leading research institute into Aboriginal and tropical health. In July 2012 Carapetis was appointed the Director of the Telethon Kids Institute. He also is a Winthrop Professor at the University of Western Australia and an infectious diseases consultant at the Perth Children's Hospital (formerly known as Princess Margaret Hospital for Children). Awards, honours and other recognition In 2013, Carapetis was awarded Honorary Doctor of Science, Charles Darwin University, Northern Territory. In 2008 Carapetis was named the Northern Territory Australian of the Year and was selected as one of Australia‚Äôs 100 Smartest people (one of the Top Ten in Medicine and Health) in The Bulletin magazine \\"Smart 100\\" list. In 2006, he was selected as one of Australia‚Äôs Top Ten Scientific Minds aged under 45 years by Cosmos Magazine.The \\"Bright Sparks\\" Awards Carapetis has written numerous textbook chapters on rheumatic fever, has been an invited speaker at more than 40 national and international conferences, and has over 150 peer reviewed publications. Carapetis' wide range of research interests includes group A streptococcal and pneumococcal diseases, other vaccine preventable diseases, vitamin D deficiency in refugees, and urinary tract infections in children. Carapetis is an Honorary Professorial Fellow, Faculty of Engineering, Health Science and Environment, Charles Darwin University; a Professor, University of Queensland; an Honorary Distinguished Research Fellow, Menzies School of Health Research; an Honorary Fellow, Murdoch Children‚Äôs Research Institute; and an Honorary Distinguished Research Fellow of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. He was elected Fellow of the Australian Academy of Health and Medical Sciences in 2015. Personal life Carapetis is married to paediatrician and epidemiologist Associate Professor Sue Skull. Together they have two daughters.

Joan Nestle later elaborated on the impetus for the Archives, writing \\"The roots of the Archives lie in the silent voices, the love letters destroyed, the pronouns changed, the diaries carefully edited, the pictures never taken, the euphemized distortions that patriarchy would let pass.\\" The motto of the Lesbian Herstory Archives is \\"In memory of the voices we have lost.\\" The original statement of purpose for the organization provided that the collection must never be bartered or sold, that it should be housed in a lesbian community space staffed by lesbians, and that all women should have access to it. The founding members of the Lesbian Herstory Archives had backgrounds in lesbian feminism and political lesbianism and included Joan Nestle, Deborah Edel, Sahli Cavallo, Pamela Oline, and Julia Penelope Stanley. Lesbian activist Mabel Hampton, who had worked as a housecleaner for Nestle's family when Nestle was growing up, was also an early collaborator. The founders started gathering and preserving documents and artifacts related to lesbian history. They were interested in the social history of the community and collected all manner of materials related to lesbian history, regardless of whether the lesbian was famous or part of a marginalized group. Edel later related how they would joke that if an object was touched by a lesbian, they would collect it. The Archives debuted in 1974 and were housed in the pantry of an Upper West Side apartment belonging to Nestle. The location of the original archives was recognized as a Women's Rights Historic Site by the borough of Manhattan in 2008. LHA began producing a newsletter, the Lesbian Herstory Archives News, in June 1975 and opened their archives to the community in 1976. In 1979 LHA became one of the earliest queer non-profits in New York when they incorporated as the Lesbian Herstory Educational Foundation. =Move to Park Slope= The Archives eventually took over much of Nestle's apartment and it was necessary to find a new home for materials. After years of fundraising that began in 1985, LHA purchased a four-story brownstone at 484 14th Street in Park Slope in 1990. The Archives were relocated to their new home in 1992 and an official opening took place in June 1993. The 16th issue of the Lesbian Herstory Archives Newsletter from December 1996 announced that the mortgage for the building had been paid off. Today its holdings include some 11,000 books and 1,300 periodical titles, as well as an unknown number of photographs. Organization and exhibitions LGBT Pride March hold a banner for the Lesbian Herstory Archives with the byline \\"In memory of the voices we have lost\\". The Lesbian Herstory Archives are run by a coordinating committee who determine which items are accepted into the archives. The Archives are entirely staffed by volunteers and interns. LHA hosts events in its space, including courses, speakers, marathon poetry readings, and an annual Valentine's Day event. Archivists from LHA regularly march in the New York City Dyke March and until 2014 in the LGBT Pride March.coordinator In the early years of the Lesbian Herstory Archives, samples of materials from the Archives were brought to speaking engagements. In order to preserve them, a traveling slide show was developed. LHA also sponsors traveling exhibits organized around various themes. Its \\"Keepin' On\\" exhibit features African American lesbians.coordinator =Collections= The Lesbian Herstory Archives began with personal materials donated by the founders. It includes everything written by founder Joan Nestle. The founders also put out a call for donations of materials and gradually increased their collection over the years. Today the collection holds all manner of historical artifacts, including papers, diaries, journals, photographs, tapes, posters, buttons, periodicals, zines, T-shirts, and videos. Copies of films are available for viewing at the Archives and originals are stored off-site in a climate- controlled storage facility. LHA has accepted donations of materials for the Archives throughout its history. Mabel Hampton donated her extensive lesbian pulp fiction collection to the Archives in 1976. Files from both the New York Lesbian and Gay Historical Society and the Lesbian History Project were donated to the Archives upon the dissolution of those organizations. The Archives hosts the Red Dot Collection, which consists of the library of the New York City chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis, the first national lesbian organization in the United States. Writer and activist Audre Lorde donated some of her manuscripts and personal papers to the Archives. The Marge MacDonald Special Collection consists of the books, papers, and journals of Marge MacDonald, who left the materials to LHA in her will over the objection of her family, who wanted to destroy them. The L Word production donated their press materials in 2010. The LHA website, which debuted in 1997, has evolved to include a digital collection featuring a virtual tour of the Archives. The digital collection is hosted by the Pratt Institute School of Information. LHA is in the process of digitizing its audio and newsprint collections and the video oral histories of the Daughters of Bilitis. LHA maintains over 1500 subject files on various topics that they microfilmed with the help of Primary Source Microfilm into a set of 175 reels.

The structure of the protein suggests that the enzymatic mechanism of flavin reductase is of a bisubstrate-biproduct nature3. Due to its structural features, the enzyme is not able to bind both NAD(P)H and flavin at the same time. Therefore, in the proposed mechanism the flavin reductase first binds NAD(P)H and stabilizes the release of a hydride3. Next, NAD(P)+ is released and the flavin mononucleotide binds to the enzyme. This is followed by further protonation when the hydride attacks a nitrogen atom on the flavin mononucleotide3. Finally, the reduced flavin is released from flavin reductase. If this mechanism is indeed correct, it suggests that the reduction of flavin by flavin reductase is dependent on the enzyme binding first to NAD(P)H3.

It is a heritage architectural monument and landmark of Baripada town, which was the erstwhile capital of the Mayurbhanj State. History The extravagantly decorated palace of the Maharaja of Mayurbhanj is a heritage building depicting the rarest engineering skill and architectural excellence of a bygone era. The construction of the first phase of the palace began on orders of Maharani Sumitra Devi Bhanj Deo in 1804, who ruled the state from 1796 to 1810. In phased development, the palace could get its aura of majesty with intricate designs during the rule of Maharaja Krushna Chandra Bhanj Deo (1868-1882), Maharaja Sriram Chandra Bhanj Deo (1882-1912) and finally during the rule of Maharaja Pratap Chandra Bhanj Deo (1928-1948). It is a brick-built double-storey structure in the classical Western style having of Doric-Corinthian column and a mixture of Greek and Victorian architecture. Lime-mortar has been used in construction of this palace. Sriram Chandra Bhanj Deo did major additions to palace in 1892, which has 126 rooms. The front of the palace, which resembles the Buckingham Palace, was also built during his reign in 1908. Local people address this palace as Rajbadi. The huge wooden doors have royal insignia carved of them. The palace is surrounded by acres of lush green ground marked by boundary. The walls of the royal bathing ghat was studded with mirrors reflecting the sun's rays on the water sprouting from a fountain illuminating the already ghat. This wonderful specimen of engineering was short-lived when the heritage building was taken over by the government. The pool was covered with wooden floors and converted into a library-cum-reading room for Maharaja Purna Chandra College that shifted to the palace in 1960. An old temple behind the main college building is on the verge of collapse. It is built like a pagoda housing several Jain and Buddhist icons. The Mayurbhanj Palace also once housed the temple of their kuladevi, Goddess Kichakeshwari, which was not only ishtadevata of Bhanj dynasty but also the State deity. Its idol was brought here from their old palace in Khiching. =Transfer of ownership= The Palace was home to six generations of rulers of Bhanj dynasty of Mayurbhanj since its foundation in 1804 till 1956. But after independence of India, Maharaja Pratap Chandra Bhanj Deo, the last ruler of the Bhanj dynasty, sold the palace along with the royals' bathing ghat at a throw-away price of in 1956, to the government of Orissa. Fading Splendor The palace needs urgent conservation and protection of this two century old heritage by the Archaeological Survey of India, historians feel. The historical palace, an example of opulence, is facing a bleak future sans proper up-keep. The double ceiling roofs have become the abode of numerous pipistrelle and pigeons. The leaky roof and decaying walls characterize the once palatial building, which now houses two colleges. The colleges the erstwhile Palace building houses are Maharaja Purna Chandra College with more than 2,000 students and Government Women's College with about 500 students. There is a growing demand since 2011, for conservation of the priceless heritage raised by town's population, historians, researchers, cultural bodies and even student's body of the college. At present the monument is repaired and looked after by Public Works Department of Orissa, which lacks expertise to handle the maintenance of the palace and such people are demanding that government should handover the repair and rehabilitation works to the Archaeological Survey of India.

Location It is located about north west of Elliott and north east of Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory. Walhallow shares a boundary to the north with Mallapunyah Station, to the south and east with Cresswell Downs, and to the south and west with Anthony Lagoon. Description Occupying an area of of open plains, mitchell grass downs, coolabah woodland and spinifex desert situated on the Barkly Tableland. The station has a carrying capacity of 50,000 head of Brahman cattle. The neighbouring property to the south is Anthony Lagoon. History The first Europeans to explore the area, which was Kotandji land , were Ernest Favenc and Nathaniel Buchanan who conducted expeditions around the Barkly Tableland area in 1878. The property was first settled by John Bassett and William Christian in 1881. Christian was still an owner of the station in 1907 a mob of 1,325 cattle were droved to Springfield. Walhallow was sold in 1913 along with all of the plant and stock to Messrs Cumming and Capper. The station was reported to have an area of approximately at this time. Very heavy rains fell in 1925 with the station recording of rain in the first three months of the year. Borroloola on the McArthur River received an equivalent amount. In 1929 an Aboriginal employee at the station was murdered by two caucasian employees. The aborigine named Paddy had stolen some sweet potatoes from the homestead garden and was confronted by the white-man, William John Everitt.

It stars the voices of Will Arnett, Brendan Fraser, Gabriel Iglesias, Jeff Dunham and Liam Neeson. Katherine Heigl, Stephen Lang, Maya Rudolph and Sarah Gadon feature in supporting roles. The film is based on Lepeniotis' 2005 short animated film Surly Squirrel. Produced by Gulfstream Pictures, Redrover International and ToonBox Entertainment, it was released in the United States on January 17, 2014, by Open Road Films. With a budget of $43 million, it is the most expensive animated film co-produced in South Korea. The film grossed $64.3 million in North America, for a worldwide total of $120.9 million. A sequel titled The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature was released on August 11, 2017. Plot In the late 1950s fictional town of Oakton City, a purple squirrel named Surly (Will Arnett) and his mute rat partner Buddy (Rob Tinkler) reside in Liberty Park where their thieving reputation has made them outcasts. A group of urban animals led by Raccoon (Liam Neeson) and his cardinal assistant are running low on food for winter. Compassionate Red squirrel Andie (Katherine Heigl) and glory hogging gray squirrel Grayson (Brendan Fraser) compete with Surly and Buddy to scavenge from a peanut cart manned by Lucky (Scott Yaphe) and Fingers (James Rankin) who are casing a bank. The squirrels' efforts inadvertently end with the cart's propane tank exploding in the park after its cord was bitten by Fingers' pug Precious (Maya Rudolph). The runaway cart ends up destroying and burning the tree, where the animals store their food. Surly is banished and Buddy follows him. In the city, they find Maury's Nut Shop. Adjacent to the bank, it is a criminal hideout used by Lucky, Fingers, their boss Percy \\"King\\" Dimpleweed (Stephen Lang) and Knuckles, who plan to break through the wall and replace the bank's cash with nuts. King's girlfriend Lana (Sarah Gadon) believes King has gone straight and the nut store is legitimate. Raccoon sends Andie and Grayson to the city to find food, but they get separated when a street rat approaches them. Andie recovers Fingers' dog whistle, which Knuckles threw out and Surly had used against Precious, and threatens to dispose of it if Surly does not share the nuts he is going to take. Surly accepts and unwittingly befriends Precious after threatening her with the whistle. Andie informs the park community of the plan. Raccoon reluctantly goes with the plan (though planning to deny Surly his share) and assigns Mole (Jeff Dunham) and the Bruisers to go with her. Surly eventually learns from Mole that Raccoon's policy is to control the food supply in order to control the animals, and that Raccoon plans on sabotaging the nut bonanza. When Andie does not believe him, Surly leaves after Grayson reunites with them. While collecting the nuts, Surly is captured by King, but he gets freed by Lana since he doesn't have the whistle anymore. Lana then leaves King. After fending off street rats who work for Raccoon, Surly and Grayson chase the criminal gang's getaway truck, which carries Raccoon and the other animals. Surly fights off Cardinal, and Mole defects from Raccoon and reveals the truth to the animals, resulting in Raccoon being voted out of the park community. King and Knuckles use the dynamite inside the empty truck to blow up a police barricade at a dam, but the police shoots the tire on the truck that falls from the dam. It explodes after Surly gets himself and Andie off it, and they fall into the river below. Surly makes it to a log, but finds out that Raccoon, King and Knuckles survived the explosion. Raccoon tries to kill Surly, but the nuts' weight begins to break the log. Knuckles slips and falls into a waterfall, presumably dead. The animals arrive to rescue Surly, but Surly, deciding to be selfless in order to protect his friends, lets go of the log and falls into the waterfall with Raccoon. The park community now sees the good side of Surly, and mourns him. The nuts make their way to Liberty Park. King and his associates are arrested as Lana breaks up with King. Andie and Buddy are still mourning over Surly, and when Precious learns what happened, she has Buddy come look at an unconscious Surly, who wakes up and hugs Buddy. Afterward, Precious leaves to meet Lana, who plans to run Maury's Nut Shop. Finding Surly alive, Andie embraces him and suggests to tell the other animals of his heroism. However, Surly declines, yet gains a willingness to work with others, and goes into the city with Buddy, allowing Grayson to take credit for the nuts making it to the park. During the credits, the animals and humans dance with an animated Psy as he performs \\"Gangnam Style\\". In a mid-credits scene, Raccoon and Cardinal are shown to have survived their ordeal and are sulking on a harbor buoy surrounded by sharks while coming up with another plan. In a post-credits scene, Precious chases Mole to get the bone he is holding that she wants and he drives her away with the dog whistle.

Reception=Critical response= On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 13%, based on 95 reviews, and an average score of 4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Hampered by an unlikable central character and source material stretched too thin to cover its brief running time, The Nut Job will provoke an allergic reaction in all but the least demanding moviegoers.\\" On Metacritic, which calculates a normalized rating from reviews, the film has an average weighted score of 37 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a \\"B\\" grade, on an A+ to F scale. Peter Debruge of Variety wrote, \\"The Nut Job comes up short compared with a film like Ratatouille, which, despite its less-than-adorable rodents, won audiences over through appealing voicework and writing.\\" Alonso Duralde of The Wrap wrote, \\"The Nut Job is merely shrill and frantic, chock-full of uninspired characters and tedious wackiness.\\" Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"A whimsical period setting helps this 3D animated caper escape some overly familiar trappings.\\" Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic wrote, \\"Arnett is a great comedic actor, an acidic wit. But here his Surly is just a selfish jerk. If there weren't some redemption involved, this wouldn't be a by-the- numbers animated feature. But it is, and there is, and it is wholly predictable.\\" Linda Barnard of the Toronto Star gave the film two out of four stars, saying, \\"If The Nut Job fails to connect through its characters it deserves praise for being a visually inspired effort, with clear homage paid to 1950s animation styles, especially Warner Bros. classics.\\" Chris Cabin of Slant Magazine gave the film one out of four stars, saying, \\"There's no personality in the design or the script, which only renders the cynical aftertaste of this convoluted one-squirrel-against the-world story all the more potent.\\" Jordan Hoffman of the New York Daily News gave the film two out of five stars, saying, \\"The cartoon is stuffed with exhausting visual mayhem. Some jokes land, but most kids over 10 will roll their eyes.\\" Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying, \\"The burnished backgrounds are pleasant to look at, but finding something to savor in the story is a tough nut to crack.\\" Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film one out of four stars, saying, \\"The Nut Job fights its protagonist's own charmlessness from the first scene. Turning a dislikable leading character a little less dislikable by the end credits sets an awfully low bar for this sort of thing.\\" Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying, \\"The overall mood resembles a furry, nut-based version of Stanley Kubrick's The Killing.\\" Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film two out of four stars, saying, \\"Someone spent a lot of time making the architecture and production design match the era. Grandparents getting dragged to The Nut Job will be appreciative.\\" Annlee Ellingson of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"The Nut Job features decent CG animation, especially of animals, but the writing isn't particularly clever, relying on obvious puns and slapstick humor.\\" Stephanie Merry of The Washington Post gave the film two out of five stars, saying, \\"That feeling of been-there-done-that is pervasive, with many of the jokes sounding like they were ripped off from other movies.\\" Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club gave the film an F, saying, \\"The most egregious problem with The Nut Job is how shamelessly it fills in the gaps left by expanding Lepeniotis‚Äô short with generic and tedious rogue-to-hero clich√©.\\" Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying, \\"The small- town setting of a half-century ago is beautifully animated by director Peter Lepenotis and his team, and there are some nicely staged old-school action sequences.\\" Scott Bowles of USA Today gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying, \\"When the story gets stale, the movie inserts a 'nuts' pun or, worse, resorts to a gas or burp joke. It doesn't work the first time, nor the fifth.\\" Miriam Bale of The New York Times wrote, \\"The Nut Job features muddy-colored and often ugly animation, a plot that feels too stretched out and loaded with details to hold the attention of most children, and more flatulence jokes than anyone deserves.\\" Adam Nayman of The Globe and Mail gave the film two out of four stars, saying, \\"Only a multilevel chase sequence involving Surly and some glowing-eyed street rats has any real kinetic excitement, and the supporting characters lack visual distinction.\\" Bill Zwecker of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying, \\"The bottom line: Kids may be mildly amused by The Nut Job, but adults accompanying them won't find much to capture their interest.\\" Kimberley Jones of The Austin Chronicle gave the film two out of five stars, saying, \\"The richly hued CG animation is quite nice ‚Äì a mix of hyperdetailed character work and painterly cityscapes and pastorals ‚Äì and the script putters along with small but regular amusements.\\" Tom Russo of The Boston Globe gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying, \\"The plot doesn‚Äôt take clever turns, the visual thrills aren‚Äôt all that thrilling, and you‚Äôre ultimately left to get your heist-movie kicks elsewhere.\\" Joel Arnold of NPR wrote, \\"Once Surly and Buddy case the joint, develop a plan, and deal with the inevitable surprises, The Nut Job could be any classic caper flick.\\" =Box office= The Nut Job grossed $64,251,541 in North America, and $56,633,986 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $120,885,527.

Act 1 takes place in the dining hall of a general, but in Act 2 the waki character, Tsuna, climbs the Rasho Gate to determine the truth of a story that a demon resides on the gate top.Asian theatre journal: ATJ - Volume 22 - Page 41 Asian Theatre Program (University and College Theatre Association) - 2005 \\"We see similar shifts in Kanze Nobumitsu's and Nagatoshi's plays. For instance, in two of Kanze Nobumitsu's plays, Rashomon (Gate of Rasho) and Funabenkei (Benkei on Board),17 the audience follows the characters from one venue to another as the story develops. Part 1 of Rashomon takes place in the dining hall of a general, whereas Part 2 sees the waki character, Tsuna, ascending the Rasho Gate in an attempt to determine the truth of the rumor that a demon is residing on the gate.\\" References Category:Noh plays Category:Rash≈çmon ","title":"Rash≈çmon (Noh play)"},{"id":"38233107","text":"Dniester in Mohyliv-Podilskyi Dniester in Soroca Euroregion Dniester (; ; ) is a euroregion located in the Moldova and Ukraine.
