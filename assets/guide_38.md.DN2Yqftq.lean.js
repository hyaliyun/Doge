They were planning to adopt a child, and had purchased a house in Massapequa. Just hours after the closing of their house, Spicehandler was struck by an automobile in Manhattan. Spicehandler subsequently died following treatment at Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center. Survivor Langan brought a malpractice suit against the Hospital, arguing standing as a \\"spouse\\" for purposes of New York's wrongful death statute. Lower court ruling In 2003, the New York Supreme Court (the state's trial court) held that Langan had standing as a \\"spouse\\" for the purposes of New York's wrongful death statute. New York courts, under principles of full faith and credit and comity recognize valid contracts established under the laws of her sister states so long as they do not offend a New York state policy. This policy is especially true of marriages celebrated in other states. Spouses in out-of-state marriages would thus be extended the privileges and immunities the marriage laws of New York extend to marriages officiated in-state. Even common law marriages, which are not recognized for in-state New York cohabiting partners, are recognized for purposes of New York spousal benefits so long as the common law marriage was validly entered into in another state. The court ruled that partners in a civil union, a relationship status wholly legal in Vermont, are therefore indistinguishable from spouses in marriage to the extent of the rights conferred to a \\"spouse\\" under New York's wrongful death statute. Intermediate court ruling On October 11, 2005, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division (intermediate appellate level court) overturned the lower court ruling. The appellate court concluded that the state legislature did not contemplate protecting same-sex couples when it enacted the wrongful death statute and that Langan had failed to demonstrate that there was no legitimate purpose for the statute's exclusion of same-sex couples. Langan v. St. Vincent‚Äôs Hospital, 802 N.Y.S.2d 476 (N.Y. App. Div. 2005). Highest court ruling The New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, affirmed in 2006 the intermediate court's decision to deny Langan standing as surviving \\"spouse\\", thus blocking Langan from bringing suit against St. Vincent's Hospital.

Her personal best jump is 1.93 metres, achieved in June 2010 at a national competition at Lillehammer. She has 1.92 metres on the indoor track, achieved in February 2010 in Eskilstuna. She is also the Norwegian record holder in the standing high jump (1,53m). Early life and career She grew up in Buvika, a settlement which had 1,856 inhabitants in 2009. She represented the club Trondheim Friidrett. In 2003, she recorded 1.78 metres as a personal best. This was recorded in the qualification round at the 2003 European Youth Olympic Festival. In the final round she jumped 1.76 metres to record a fifth place. She also won her first national championship medal, a bronze. She struggled more in the 2004 season, recording 1.73 as a season's best. Near the end of the year it became clear that she had struggled with infectious mononucleosis. In 2005 a \\"lift project\\" was set up by the national association. It was spearheaded by former World Championships competitor Anne Gerd Eieland, and in total, seven women were a part of the project. Coaches were Dan Simion and Adrian Proteasa while the architect of the project was Terje Totland. Simion soon left, but Hanne Haugland was added as a coach. Also, the project was shrunk to four jumpers, because injury struck some of the project members. The goal was to have two jumpers qualified for the 2008 Olympic Games. Around this time, Kufaas still lived in Buvika, and trained in the nearby city Trondheim (Strinda) as well as in the local B√∏ndernes Hus. Traditionally a social house for the farmers' community, B√∏ndernes Hus was reinvented by Kufaas and her coach as a makeshift high jump arena, with modest economic support from Skaun municipality and local businesses. The \\"lift project\\" was disestablished after the 2006 season, however. Later career Her result progression was positive. She achieved a new personal best in August 2005, when jumping 1.81 at the Norwegian Championships at Fana stadion to win the silver behind Anne Gerd Eieland. In early 2006 she improved further at the Norwegian Indoor Championships. She did not win, but beat Anne Gerd Eieland and achieved the same result as the winner √òyunn Grindem, with 1.83 metres. She beat Eieland again at the 2006 Norwegian Championships at Bislett stadion, when she won her first national title with 1.83 metres. Her personal best had been improved to 1.85 metres in May. She added another centimetre to this in June 2007 in Stj√∏rdalshalsen. In the summer she took a national silver medal, behind Eieland, and competed at the European U23 Championships. Here she finished sixth in the final, equalling her personal best with 1.86 metres. 2008 In early 2008 she repeated her intention to qualify for the 2008 Olympics. She made her European Cup debut in the last edition of the competition, winning the Second League with 1.85 metres, and at the Norwegian Championships that year at Trondheim stadion, she won the gold medal in the high jump with 1.87 metres. This was a new personal best as well as a stadium record. She also finished fourth in the 200 metres event, and won a gold medal with her club in the Swedish relay. In the autumn of 2008 she moved to Oslo and enrolled at the Norwegian Police University College. She was reunited with Hanne Haugland as a coach, and joined the club IL i BUL from New Year's. 2009 In the 2009 indoor season she quickly equalled her personal best of 1.87 metres, during a meet in Gothenburg. At the Norwegian Indoor Championships she started by setting her first ever Norwegian record, in the standing high jump. Her new record was 1.53 metres, an improvement from 1.52 which had stood since 1984. After passing 1.53, she declined to continue the competition. She won the high jump event the next day, and also the standing long jump. Her 2.91 metres is only one centimetre behind the Norwegian record in that event; in fact she was only millimetres from achieving 2.92. In total, she has six national titles in the standing high jump (2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009) and three in the standing long jump (2006, 2008, 2009). These are indoor only. She competed at the 2009 European Indoor Championships. With 1.80 metres she failed to reach the final. In the early 2009 outdoor season, Kufaas made a definite breakthrough. She improved her personal best by four centimetres to 1.91 metres, winning for Norway at the 2009 European Team Championships First League. Norway surprisingly won promotion to the Super League, and Kufaas had achieved the qualifying standard for the 2009 World Championships. At the high jump competition there she failed to reach the final. She stated that she did not like the track of the Olympiastadion, comparing it to a sponge. 2010 She started the 2010 indoor season with a few mediocre competitions before leaping to 1.92 metres on 6 February in Eskilstuna. Two weeks later she won the 2010 Norwegian Indoor Championships in a new championship record (counted since 2004) of 1.87 metres. At the 2010 World Indoor Championships she managed 1.89 metres, but it was not enough to reach the final. In the outdoor season she jumped a personal best at a national competition at Lillehammer and qualified for the European Championships in Barcelona. Later she became again national champion in Stavanger (1.89m). 2011 Kufaas was less successful in the 2011 season which was hampered by neck problems. At the European Indoor Championships in Paris she jumped to 12th place with 1,89 m. In the outdoor season her best performance was 1,88 m achieved during a high jump meeting in Sollentuna, Sweden. She could not defend her inndoor or outdoor national championships from 2010 and became second behind Tonje Angelsen in both events. Kufaas graduated from the Norwegian Police University College in 2011.

They were viewed as symbols of the authority given to the ruler by the mandate of heaven. At the time of the Shang dynasty during the 2nd millennium , the tripod cauldrons came to symbolize the power and authority of the ruling dynasty with strict regulations imposed as to their use. Members of the scholarly gentry class were permitted to use one or three cauldrons; the ministers of state (, d√†f≈´) five; the vassal lords seven; and only the sovereign Son of Heaven was entitled to use nine.Gongyang Zhuan's Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals - The use of the nine tripod cauldrons to offer ritual sacrifices to the ancestors from heaven and earth was a major ceremonial occasion so that by natural progression the ding came to symbolize national political powerStrategies of the Warring States, Scroll 1 - Eastern Zhou The Qin State Dispatched Troops to the Borders of Zhou to Demand the Nine Tripod Cauldrons (). and later to be regarded as a National Treasure. Sources state that two years after the fall of the Zhou dynasty at the hands of what would become the Qin dynasty the nine tripod cauldrons were taken from the Zhou royal palace and moved westward to the Qin capital at Xianyang.Records of the Grand Historian - Scrolls 6, 28 of Qin ShihuangLunheng - Scroll 26 However, by the time Qin Shi Huang had eliminated the other six Warring States to become the first emperor of China in 221 , the whereabouts of the nine tripod cauldrons were unknown. Sima Qian records in his Records of the Grand Historian that they were lost in the Si River to where Qin Shi Huang later dispatched a thousand men to search for the cauldrons but to no avail. Origin The Records of the Grand Historian recount that once Yu the Great had finished taming the floods that once engulfed the land, he divided the territory into the Nine Provinces and collected bronze in tribute from each one. Thereafter he cast the metal into nine large tripod cauldrons.Records of the Grand Historian - Scroll 28 \\"\\" Legend says that each ding weighed around 30,000 catties equivalent to 7.5 tons. However, the Zuo Zhuan or Commentary of Zuo, states that the nine tripod cauldrons were cast by Yu the Great's son, Qi of Xia, the second Xia Emperor, and it was he who received the tributes of bronze from the Nine Provinces.Zuo Zhuan, Third year of Duke XuanRecords of the Grand Historian Chu Family Records () The Xia Shu () section of the Book of Documents contains the Yu Gong or \\"Tribute of Yu\\" that describes the rivers and mountains of the Nine Provinces. Vicissitudes of the cauldrons After Tang of Shang overthrew Jie of Xia, the nine tripod cauldrons were moved to the Shang capital at Yan. Later, when the Shang king Pan Geng moved his capital to Yin (), the cauldrons again went with him. Following the overthrow of the Shang Dynasty by the Zhou Dynasty, the new King Wu of Zhou put the nine tripod cauldrons on public display for the first time.Records of the Grand Historian Scroll 4, Zhou Biography When King Cheng of Zhou ascended the throne, the Duke of Zhou built the eastern capital of Luoyi (later Luoyang), he moved the cauldrons there, at the same time asking King Cheng to carry out their ritual installation in the settlement's Ancestral Hall ().According to an annotation to the text of Mozi by his disciple Geng Zhuzi (), After the Xia Dynasty lost the cauldrons, the Yin (Shang) Dynasty received them, when they lost them, the Zhou Dynasty received them. \\"\\" The power of the Zhou royal family began to decline at the start of the Eastern Zhou Period in 771 , with each vassal state clamoring for kingship. At the time of King Ding of Zhou (r. 605-506 ), King Zhuang of Chu inquired for the first time regarding the \\"weight of the cauldrons\\" () only to be rebuffed by the Zhou minister Prince Man (). Asking such a question was at that time a direct challenge to the power of the reigning dynasty. King Ling of Chu (r. 540 - 529 ) later again inquired of the cauldrons but was unsuccessful due to unrest sweeping the countryRecords of the Grand Historian - Chu Family Records During the reign of King Huiwen of Qin (r.338 - 311 ), the strategist Zhang Yi formulated a plan by which he hoped to seize the Nine Tripod Cauldrons and thus gain command of the other Zhou vassal states.Strategies of the Warring States - Scroll 3 King Qingxiang of Chu, along with the king of the State of Qi also sought possession of the treasures as did the states of Wei and Han. The last Eastern Zhou monarch King Nan of Zhou (314-256 ) dealt with all these rival claimants by playing them off against one another and thus kept possession of the cauldrons. Loss and recasting After the overthrow of Zhou and the foundation of the new Qin Dynasty, the Nine Tripod Cauldrons disappeared. Theories as to their fate abound with no clear agreement amongst scholars. Amongst these theories are claims that the cauldrons were: *lost in the Si River near Pencheng () by King Zhaoxiang of Qin (r. 306-250 ) en route to the Qin Capital *stolen by Quanrong nomads following the fall of Haojing in 771 ; *melted down and recast into coins or weapons in the final years of the Zhou Dynasty. According to historical records, both Qin Shi Huang and Emperor Wen of Han (r. 180-157 )Lunheng - Scroll 13 searched for the nine tripod cauldrons in the Si River but with no success. Later emperors time and again recast the cauldrons, the most well known examples being Wu Zetian in the fourth month of 697 CE Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government ‚Äì Scroll 206 and the two recastings by Song Dynasty Huizong Emperor in 1105 CE.Book of Song ‚Äì Scroll 66 Cauldrons were also cast by other dynasties in the Sinosphere, such as the Nguyen dynasty. The Nine Cauldrons of the Nguyen dynasty are placed in front of the Ancestral Temple in Hue Imperial Palace. In 2006, the National Museum of China in Beijing cast Nine Tripod Cauldrons which are now on permanent display as a tourist attraction.(in Japanese) Treasures of the Zhou Royal Family on Display in Beijing Cultural influence Baopuzi mentions \\"Records on the Nine Cauldrons\\" (Jiu ding ji ), an alleged description of the vessels commenting on their protective function. In all Chinese speaking societies, if someone commented on someone's words as having the weight of nine tripod cauldrons (), this was a great compliment to the person. It meant that the person was very trustworthy and would never break their promises.

The movie features Kajol, Arjun Rampal and Kareena Kapoor in the lead roles, and is an official remake of the 1998 film Stepmom. It released worldwide on 3 September 2010, and a day before in India and UAE. Upon release, it received positive reviews from critics. In particular Kajol and Kareena Kapoor's performance were much acclaimed. Plot Maya is a perfect mother whose life revolves around her three children, Aaliya, Ankush, and Anjali. Despite being divorced from Aman, Maya has ensured that they remain a happy family unit. However, things take an unexpected turn when Aman's girlfriend, Shreya Arora, a career-oriented fashion designer with a lot to learn about children, joins the family. When Aman introduces Shreya at Anjali's birthday party, she accidentally drops Anjali's birthday cake, which leads the children to perceive her as evil. At a fashion show, Anjali helps Shreya with one of the outfits for the models. When Shreya goes to get ice cream for the children, Aaliya tells her siblings that she is using them so she can take their father away, and Anjali goes missing after. At the police station, Anjali is found and Aman tells Shreya that she cannot go near the children without Maya's permission. Maya finds out that she has cervical cancer and tells Aman, which prompts him to move back in with the family and leave Shreya. However, he is unable to forget her, which Maya notices. Maya tells their children that she has cancer and Aaliya retaliates by going to a party with an older boy. Maya then tells Shreya that she has cancer, and tells her she wants her to take care of the kids after she's gone, as they‚Äôll need a mother in their lives. Shreya refuses at first, not believing herself to be the ‚Äòmom type,‚Äô but agrees to move in and leave her career. In the following days, the children develop an attachment towards Shreya but when Maya and Shreya have an argument, it is revealed that Shreya is an orphan. After the argument, Aman tells Maya that they should not be competing with each other for the children's love. Maya faints and is brought to the hospital, where the doctor tells her that she has only a few days left. Shreya decides to take care of the children while Aman tends to Maya. When Shreya and the children go to visit Maya at the hospital, the two women have a private conversation. Shreya admits that the children need their real mother, not her. Maya bequeaths guardianship of the children to Shreya, and confesses a mistake she made that almost killed Anjali. She explains to Shreya that not every mother is perfect but that she needs to keep trying. Maya tells Aman she wants to return home for Diwali as the last chance to see her house before she dies. During the festival, the children hold a special event for her, replaying the memories they had together. When they take a family photograph, Maya asks Shreya to join, as she is now family. Ten years later, it is Aaliya‚Äôs wedding and Shreya gifts her a bracelet which belonged to Maya. Shreya speaks to the family portrait and says to Maya‚Äôs photo that she eventually became the mom type. During the marriage rounds, Shreya looks at the sky and recalls Maya saying she had their yesterday and Shreya has their tomorrow and she smiles.

Unlike the backspin and topspin the ball is hit with a swipe at neutral level. This effect is created by driving through the ball to push it forward rather than brushing up or down the back creating spin. The shot is commonly used for power and helps quicken the pace on the ball during play. Uses of the Flat Shot Goran Ivani≈°eviƒá prepares to serve in Wimbledon in 2004. Ivani≈°eviƒá is considered to have one of the greatest serves in tennis history. Flat shots have many applications in tennis, particularly on the serve. The flat serve is most often used for a first serve, due to its speed and little room for error. Most flat serves fly straight through the air and bounce relatively medium-low in comparison to other types of serves. They are characterized by their speed and placement. A good flat serve should be aimed along the center of the court, where the net is lowest, in order to maximize chances of landing the serve. Although the placement of this serve is generally the same, its speed at arrival is often used to generate aces or service winners. Many professional players utilize strong flat serves, such as Robin S√∂derling and Andy Roddick. Advantages of the Flat Shot * Power * Good for tricking opponents that expect other shots * more force Which causes giving less time fore opponent to react Disadvantages of the Flat Shot * Smaller margin for error * Little to no spin * Gives little time for player to get set-up * Requires skill * Requires adequate ability to hit with power Some of the notable players who usually use flat groundstrokes * Chris Evert * Serena Williams (Although she currently employs more variety of spins in her shots, at the beginning of her career she was a master of flattening out her shots and is still near the top when it comes to this ability) * Maria Sharapova * Venus Williams * Petra Kvitov√° * Andy Roddick * Fernando Gonz√°lez * Ivo Karloviƒá * James Blake * Jimmy Connors * Miloslav Meƒç√≠≈ô * Nikolay Davydenko * Robin S√∂derling * Andy Murray * Tom√°≈° Berdych * Luk√°≈° Rosol * Roger Federer (More so at the beginning of his career, possessed the remarkable ability to flatten out his shots with extreme precision.

Landrigan) of The Arnhold Global Health Institute, a division of The Mount Sinai Medical Center dedicated to finding evidence-based solutions to global health problems. In 1996, Muller co-founded the Mount Sinai Visiting Doctors Program, now the largest academic physician home visiting program in the country. Biography Muller was born in 1964 in Tel Aviv, Israel. He received his BA from Johns Hopkins University in 1986 and his M.D. from the New York University School of Medicine in 1991. Postdoctoral training included an internship and residency in internal medicine at The Mount Sinai Medical Center, where he was Chief Resident from 1994 to 1995. Muller joined the faculty at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in 1993. In 2004, he was named associate professor of medicine; in 2005 he was named dean and associate professor of medical education. In September, 2005, he was named Chairman of the Department of Medical Education. Muller‚Äôs Visiting Doctors Program was conceived in 2005 as a response to the concern that the demands of residency training were creating a breed of physicians who needed to be reminded that \\"patients are people, not biochemical analyses.\\" The program, the largest of its kind in the United States, services approximately 1,000 homebound elderly patients annually and trains approximately 200 medical students, residents, and fellows annually in the provision of home care. Muller holds a dual citizenship in Israel and the United States.

The series was set in a Roger Rabbit-like world where \\"toons\\" and humans co-exist. The premise of the series was that Bonkers D. Bobcat, an anthropomorphic bobcat who was a popular cartoon star (he appeared in Disney's Raw Toonage shorts in the fictional world of Bonkers as well) had washed out of show business and became a cop. He was made the junior partner of Detective Lucky Piquel, a grim and ill-tempered human who hates toons. Throughout the series, the pair work together to solve crimes in the Hollywood, Los Angeles, California region. Bonkers repeatedly tried to win Piquel's praise, but usually just ended up ruining missions with his antics. After some years of working with Bonkers, Piquel was given an FBI job in Washington, D.C., and with great glee was finally able to leave Bonkers, but finally realized that after all the time spent hating working with Bonkers, he had grown to love him. At the end of the \\"Lucky\\" episodes, Bonkers was given a new partner, the attractive Sergeant Miranda Wright. Although also human, she was far more patient and tolerant of his antics than was Piquel. With Miranda, Bonkers was more the brunt of the slapstick. Broadcast chronology Bonkers' 65 episodes all aired on The Disney Afternoon during the 1993‚Äì94 television season. However, the series can be broken up into multiple groups of episodes, based on when they originally aired and from which set of episodes they came (i.e., the Lucky Piquel episodes, the Miranda Wright episodes, or the Raw Toonage compilation episodes). Nine of the 19 Miranda Wright episodes first aired on The Disney Channel between February and June 1993 as a preview for the series. These are referred to here as \\"Group 1.\\" The syndicated run of the show began with a special hour-long airing of the Lucky Piquel pilot story (\\"Going Bonkers\\"/\\"Gone Bonkers\\"), that aired the weekend before the series' Disney Afternoon premiere. This first episode was later split into two parts, which are treated as separate episodes. Nineteen more Lucky episodes subsequently premiered in September and October 1993. These 21 episodes are referred to here as \\"Group 2.\\" In October 1993, the 19 Miranda Wright episodes aired on The Disney Afternoon, preceded by a special crossover episode, \\"New Partners on the Block,\\" which tied the previously produced Miranda episodes into the continuity of the Lucky Piquel episodes. Along with the 9 Miranda episodes previously shown on The Disney Channel, 10 more Miranda episodes made their debut. The 10 new Miranda episodes, along with \\"New Partners on the Block,\\" are referred to here as \\"Group 3.\\" In November 1993, 20 more Lucky Piquel episodes began airing on The Disney Afternoon. Fifteen of them premiered in November, with the last 5 being held over until February 1993 (most likely to coincide with the February ratings sweeps). The last 20 Lucky episodes are referred to here as \\"Group 4.\\" In addition, four compilation episodes, featuring the Bonkers segments from Raw Toonage were interspersed among the other episodes. These episodes are listed separately. When the series went into reruns, the Lucky Piquel and Miranda Wright episodes were usually rerun separately (i.e., all of the Lucky episodes, then all of the Miranda episodes, then the Lucky episodes again, etc.), even if the episodes were rerun out of order. (The compilation episodes would be rerun with the Lucky episodes.) Each episode was given a production code by Walt Disney Television Animation. These codes are in the format \\"4311-xxx\\"; the Miranda episodes are numbered \\"4311-0xx\\", while the Lucky episodes (along with \\"New Partners on the Block\\" and the compilation episodes) are numbered \\"4311-1xx.\\" The Miranda episodes' production numbers are not consecutive; several numbers are skipped over. The production codes have been sourced from the individual episode registration records in the U.S. Copyright Office catalog. (Since not all of these episode records have a listed production code, and because of the skips in the Miranda episode numbering, the codes for \\"The Stork Exchange\\" and \\"Toon for a Day\\" are not known.) In addition, Disney's distribution arm Buena Vista Television used a different numbering system, with all of the Lucky Piquel episodes in production code order, followed by \\"New Partners on the Block\\", then all of the Miranda Wright episodes in production code order, with the four compilation episodes randomly interspersed among the Lucky episodes (except for \\"If,\\" which is placed between \\"New Partners on the Block\\" and the rest of the Miranda episodes). BVTV's episode codes carry the prefix \\"BK-xx\\". This numbering was also the order generally used when the series was broadcast outside of North America, except with \\"Going Bonkers\\" and \\"Gone Bonkers\\" moved to the beginning of the order. The resultant \\"international\\" order (excluding the compilation episodes) perhaps most closely reflects the series' in- universe chronology.

Danilevsky is well known as the author of the novel Beglye v Novorossii (Fugitives in New Russia, 1862). Life Born into the family of an impoverished landowner, Petr Ivanovich Danilevsky, in the Izyumsky district of Kharkov Governorate, Grigory was educated in the Moscow Dvoryansky institut (Institute of the Nobility) from 1841 to 1846, then studied law at Saint Petersburg University. In 1849 he was mistakenly arrested in connection with the Petrashevsky case and spent several months in the prison of the Peter and Paul Fortress, but he was released and received his certification as kandidat in 1850. From 1850 to 1857 he served in the Ministry of Education, where he was sent a number of times to examine the archives of monasteries in the south. In 1856 he was one of the writers sent by Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolaevich to study the borderlands of Russia. In 1857 he retired to his estates in the Kharkov Governorate, serving in various local offices, but in 1869 he became an assistant editor of the new Pravitelstvenny vestnik (Government Herald) and in 1881 was named the chief editor, thus becoming part of the council supervising the Russian press. He died in December 1890 in Saint Petersburg and was buried in the village of Prishib in the Kharkov region, Ukraine. Literary career Aside from some minor verses and translations, Danilevsky's first literary work was a series of stories of Ukrainian life and traditions, collected in 1854 in the book Slobozhane (Sloboda dwellers). His first novel, Beglye v Novorossii (Fugitives in Novorossiya, 1862), published under the pseudonym D. Skavronsky, brought him wide success; it was followed by Beglye vorotilis (The return of the fugitives, 1863) and Novye mesta (New places, 1867), the whole trilogy describing the settlement of the Ukrainian steppe by runaway serfs.Myroslav Shkandrij, Russia and Ukraine: Literature and the Discourse of Empire from Napoleonic to Postcolonial Times (McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 2001: ), p. 169. His 1868 story \\"Zhizn cherez sto let\\" (Life a hundred years from now, 1868) was a work of science fiction imagining the year 1968. Better known are his novels of the following decades, published in Vestnik Evropy and Russkaya Mysl (Russian Thought). In 1874 appeared Devyaty val (The ninth wave), about the struggle between conservatives and reformers in the 1860s. The following year he wrote Mirovich, which \\"deals with the tragic fate of the deposed child-emperor Ioann Antonovich and the foiled attempt by Lieutenant Mirovich to free him from Shlisselburg,\\" but it was banned by the censor and did not appear until 1879;Dan Ungurianu, Plotting History: The Russian Historical Novel in the Imperial Age (University of Wisconsin Press, 2007: ), p. 128. Isabel Florence Hapgood called it his best novel, \\"though it takes unwarrantable liberties with the personages of the epoch depicted.\\"Isabel Florence Hapgood, A Survey of Russian Literature, with Selections (Chautauqua Press, 1902), p. 230. It was followed by Na Indiyu pri Petre (To India in Peter's day, 1880); Knyazhna Tarakanova (Princess Tarakanova, 1883), about the self-proclaimed daughter of Empress Elizabeth; Sozhzhennaya Moskva (Moscow destroyed by fire, 1886), about Napoleon's invasion in 1812; Cherny god (The black year, 1888), about Pugachev's Rebellion; and a series of short stories.

As a result, the three states were often referred to as the \\"Three Jins\\" (). Because the process took several decades, there is some debate between scholars as to the year which best marks the true partition of Jin. state the most common dates picked by historians are 481, 475, 468, and 403 BCE. The last date, according to Sima Guang marks the conferring of Marquessates by King Weilie of Zhou on Wei Si, ruler of the State of Wei; Zhao Ji, ruler of the State of Zhao, and Han Qian, ruler of the State of Han.Sima Guang, \\"Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government\\" In 386 BCE, the states of Han, Wei and Zhao deposed Duke Jing of Jin and divided the last remaining Jin territory between themselves, which marked the end of the Jin state. Background Succession issues were constant in Jin as far back as seventh century BCE. Even when, for example, King Xi of Zhou used his royal clout to give legitimacy to Wu of Quwo as the rightful duke of Jin in 678 BCE, succession issues continued to arise. At the same time that the Jin duke was conquering new lands, a process of \\"subinfeudation\\" or \\"rear vassalage\\" occurred in the early and middle parts of the Spring and Autumn period, wherein aristocratic title and territory were awarded to vassals loyal to Jin, rather than to the Zhou royalty. However, Jin was unique among the major states in a major respect; whereas other states often enfeoffed the cadet branches of the ruling house, Jin had a policy of exiling or disempowering its own cadet houses. Instead, powerful ministerial families arose which were given fiefs like cadet houses in other states. For example, the house of Zhao descended from Zhao Cui, while the house of Wei descended from Wei Chou, both of whom were retainers of Duke Wen of Jin; the house of Han in turn descended from Han Wan, who was an uncle of Duke Wu of Jin. Over time, while other powerful states (like Chu) were centralizing power through a rising bureaucracy, Jin continued to have a feudal power structure with aristocratic families ruling even individual counties. Over the course of a few generations, the major aristocratic families gained enough power to undermine the ruling duke's authority. During most of the seventh and sixth centuries BCE, Jin was composed of an assortment of semi-independent city- states fighting each other and the Jin Duke as much as they fought other states. In one extreme case, Viscount Xian of Xi, a retainer of Duke Jing of Jin, attempted to invade the state of Qi with only the troops under his command.Zuo Zhuan, Duke Xuan, 17th year of Growing aristocracy The House of Zhao (Ë∂ô/Ëµµ) gained in prominence after Duke Wen placed them in charge of newly conquered lands. such that, in 607 BCE, they deposed a duke that attempted to curb their political power. The Xian clan (ÂÖà) was eliminated in 596 BCE. Duke Li of Jin encouraged the Luan clan (Ê†æ) to lead a military coalition that squashed the rising power of the Xi clan (ÈÉ§). Subsequently, in 573, Luan supporters had Duke Li murdered and placed a puppet on the throne and the clan was then itself eliminated by 550, making the Zhi, Zhao, and Han (Èü©) clans the most powerful at about this time. Soon after, the Wei clan (È≠è) also grew in power. In the leadup to the civil war, the dominant clans were the Zhao, Wei, Han, Fan (ËåÉ), Zhi (Êô∫) and Zhonghang (‰∏≠Ë°å) who were collectively called the \\"Six Titled Retainers\\" (). These six aristocratic families dominated Jin in the late Spring and Autumn period, basically using the ruling duke as a figurehead until Jin was split into three separate states. Civil war After the 546 BCE truce agreement between Jin and Chu (itself prompted in part by Jin's internal difficulties), conflicts between aristocrats and with the Duke escalated and a civil war (497-453 BCE) commenced. In 514 BCE, Yangshe clan and Qi clan's force was destroyed by the conspiracy of Zhao, Han, Wei, Zhi, Zhonghang and Fan clan. During the time of Duke Ding of Jin (511-475), the Fan and Zhonghang clans were in turn eliminated, leaving only the Zhi, Zhao, Han, and Wei clans remaining. By about 450s BCE, the Zhi clan was the most dominant and began demanding territory from the other clans.  Zhao's internal conflicts  In 497 BCE, Handan Wu of Handan's Zhao and Jianzi of Jinyang's Zhao became enemies with each other over 500 hundred soldiers' ownership. Jianzi of Zhao insisted that Handan should transfer the 500 soldiers to Jinyang. After consulting with his clansmen, Handan Wu (or Zhao Wu of Handan) refused his cousin Jianzi. Jianzi summoned Wu and imprisoned him for his trespass against the main branch of Zhao clan. Later, Wu was executed by Jianzi. The clan conflicts within the Zhao clan escalated to a higher level after the execution of Handan Wu. Wenzi of Zhonghang, whose nephew was executed, was enraged. Zhaozi of Fan, who intermarried with Zhonghang clan, was also concerned with Zhao's imprudence on the matter of Handan's execution. When Handan Ji and Shebing started their rebellion against Jinyang's Zhao, Zhonghang and Fan clan intervened and supported the demands of Handan clan. In August, 497 BCE, Zhonghang, Fan and Handan attacked Zhao's force and defeated him. Zhonghang and Fan's triumphs caused other vassal clans of the Duke of Jin to worry. Jianzi of Han, Xiangzi of Wei and Wenzi of Zhi invaded Zhonghang and Fan's fief under the name of Duke Ding of Jin. Wenzi of Zhonghang and Zhaozi of Fan eventually lost their struggle against Han, Zhao, Wei and Zhi. Their attempt of attacking the united force with the Jin duke inside was disastrous. After the battle, Zhonghang and Fan fled to Chao Ge while Jianzi of Zhao returned to the state of Jin. The Handan conflict led to the decline of Zhonghang and Fan clan which prepared the way for the formation of Han, Zhao and Wei's hegemony in Jin's court.Zuo Zhuan, Duke Ding, 13th year of. Fan clan's resistance in Chao Ge was supported by Zhou dynasty, Qi, Lu, Wey and Zheng. Jianzi of Zhao waged numerous battles with the aim of eliminating Fan clan. In 471 BCE, Handan clan was eliminated by Jianzi. In 470 BCE, Zhaozi of Fan lost all his lands and fled to the state of Qi.Zuo Zhuan, Duke Ai, 4th, 5th year of. The Battle of Jinyang Acting on his own accord, the Jin Minister Zhi Xiangzi () used the Zhi clan's place in the Jin court to intimidate and demand territory from ministers Han Kangzi () of the Han clan and Wei Huanzi of the Wei clan. After Zhao Xiangzi () of the Zhao clan rejected Zhi Xiangzi's demands in 455 BCE, Zhi Xiangzi attacked the Zhao clan while compelling the Han and Wei clans to send troops. Zhao Xiangzi retreated to the Jin city of Jinyang in 455 BCE, and the united forces laid siege for two years while also diverting water supplies away from the city. Faced with a critical situation, Zhao Xiangzi sent an envoy who persuaded the Han and Wei clans to change sides. They arrived and diverted a huge stream of water that split Zhi Xiangzi's camp in two, then captured and killed Zhi Xiangzi. In 453 BCE, the Zhao, Han, and Wei clans annihilated the Zhi clan. As their respective powers were so balanced, none of the three remaining aristocratic families felt they could feasibly gain an upper hand over the others. So, in 403 BCE, they divided the state's lands among themselves into the \\"three Jins\\" of Wei, Han, and Zhao. All three states quickly formed strong bureaucracies, thereby weakening the potential for any aristocratic families from encroaching on their power. This same year, King Weilie of Zhou proclaimed Jin, Wei, Han, and Zhao as equals. Remaining Jin lands Duke Ai of Jin died in 434 BCE and was succeeded by Duke You of Jin. The Han, Zhao and Wei clans divided up surplus Jin territory amongst themselves, leaving only Jiang County and Quwo County (both in modern-day Shanxi Province) for Duke You of Jin. Because Zhao Xiangzi was the younger son who forced his way to the inheritance, he decided to name his elder brother Zhao Bolu () and his descendants as heir, with Bolu's grandson Zhao Xianzi () eventually becoming heir apparent. However, after Zhao Xiangzi died, his son Zhao Huanzi () banished Zhao Xianzi and appointed himself ruler of the Zhao estates and paramount minister of Jin. Zhao Huanzi himself died a year later, whereupon the Zhao clan and vassals killed all of his sons and invited Zhao Xianzi back. Later on, Zhao Xianzi's son Marquess Lie of Zhao succeeded as ruler. In 349 BCE, the Han and Zhao states divided the remaining Jin territory between themselves, thus marked the end of the state of State of Jin.

He was born and raised in the West Riding of Yorkshire in Northern England. He earned his B.A. degree from Oxford University, and was ordained at age 23. Methodist connections from Oxford led to a colonial mission in America where he developed a keen interest in the Moravian church from German missionaries. Following a 1738 visit to Germany for greater exposure to the Moravian faith, Ingham returned to preaching in Yorkshire for the next four years. During this time he built up a following of more societies than he could manage. Ingham relinquished control of his societies to the Moravian Brethren in 1742. Ingham‚Äôs Moravian transformation occurred the year following his marriage to Lady Margaret Hastings. The Moravians, or Unitas Fratrum, were recognized by the British Crown in 1749 thereby creating the Moravian Church in England. While Ingham‚Äôs bond with his Brethren strengthened, it was a relationship that was to evolve. By the early 1750s Ingham found his views differing from the Oxford Methodists. When the viewpoints of the Moravian elders clashed with those representing the Church of England, Ingham used this 1753 scandal to distance himself from his Brethren and reestablish his own Inghamite societies. Still insecure as an independent church, Ingham turned to Sandemanianism during the final years of his life as a viable option forward for his followers. While he shared many Sandemanian views he chose independence instead. The majority of his societies splintered and joined with other denominations which included Methodists, Sandemanians and Congregationalists. He died at Aberford in 1772, four years after his wife. He left his fortune to his nephew Joseph Whitaker of the Whitaker family. Early life Benjamin Ingham was born in Ossett, Yorkshire, on 11 June 1712 [O.S.]. His father, William Ingham, was a descendant of a group of clergy ejected from the Church of England by the Act of Uniformity 1662.See page 57 of Tyerman (1895). He attended Batley Grammar School and Queen‚Äôs College, Oxford, where he completed a B.A. degree in 1734. He was ordained the following year by the Bishop of Oxford, Dr. John Potter. While at Oxford, Ingham made the acquaintance of the Wesley brothers, John and Charles, and George Whitefield, all of whom had joined John Wesley‚Äôs society of Methodists at Oxford. This society has been referred to as the Holy Club.See page 60 of Tyerman (1895). Missionary Work in Georgia Colonial Map of North America. On 9 June 1732 [O.S.], King George II of Great Britain enacted a corporate charter authorizing James Oglethorpe to colonize the Province of Georgia. Oglethorpe planted his original colony near an Indian village along the banks of the Savannah River. The city that later formed here took on the name of the river that flowed past. Tomochichi, a Yamacraw chief, together with John and Mary Musgrove (outpost traders), were instrumental to Oglethorpe as mediators and interpreters in the establishment of peaceful relations between the original European settlers in Georgia and the Lower Creek people. Word travelled quickly throughout Europe that both land and English citizenship were available in Georgia. Count Nicolous Ludwig von Zinzendorf arranged for August Gottlieb Spangenberg to lead a party of 10 Moravians to the province in January 1736, just ahead of Oglethorpe‚Äôs return. Scotch Highlanders sailed from Inverness aboard the Prince of Wales in October. They arrived in January 1736 and established their town of New Inverness. Rev. John McLeod was their minister.See pages 62, 123-5, and 127 of Stevens (1847). After a four-month stay in England, Tomochichi's Creek party returned to Georgia with the first group of 56 Salzburgers.See pages 146-150 of Bruce (1890). During his return to Georgia, Oglethorpe‚Äôs party of 231 persons set sail from Gravesend, Kent in December aboard the brigs Simond and London Merchant. They were accompanied on part of their journey by the sloop HMS Hawke. Among the passengers were the brothers, John and Charles Wesley, Benjamin Ingham, Chas. Delamotte, 26 Moravians led by their bishop, David Nitschman, and a second group of Salzburgers headed by Baron Philip George Friederich von Reck.See page 131 of Stevens (1847). The Salzburgers were a group of Lutherans expelled around 1731 by the Catholic Ruler of Austria (see Early modern Europe). There were many other nationalities represented in this group of immigrants. These colonists arrived off Savannah on 8 February 1736 [O.S.].See page 767 Julian (1892).See pages 185, 186, and 245 of Spangenberg (1838).See pages 51-53 of Stevens (1878). 1736 Map of New Ebenezer drawn by Philipp Georg Friedrich von Reck. This Salzburger community was located about 15 miles upriver from Savannah, Georgia. During the first months ashore, this second wave of colonists established fortifications and dwellings among and around the various settlements as they adjusted to their Georgian setting. The community leaders incessantly communicated with one another discussing future plans. The Moravian Brethren, at the inclination of Oglethorpe, built a schoolhouse near Tomochichi‚Äôs village to teach reading and writing to the Creek children. The site was named Irene, and was built over the grave of an earlier chief. John T√∂ltschig led five other Moravians to the island location and started the construction on 13 August 1736 [N.S.].See page 152 of Fries (1905). The German writer of this text wrote dates using only the Gregorian calendar.See page 365 of Stevens (1847). The building had three rooms: one for Benjamin Ingham, one for Peter Rose and his wife, and the third would be the schoolroom for the children. The hut was finished the next month allowing the mission to proceed. This arrangement initially worked well for all parties. Benjamin Ingham acted as liaison between the main settlement in Savannah and this school, where he and the Roses instructed the children. The Indian village went on the warpath, and Ingham sailed to England, via Pennsylvania on 9 March 1737 [N.S.]. He returned to London to rally support for the colony. In his possession were letters from Spangenberg to the Trustees of the Province of Georgia. John Wesley followed Ingham to London some months later.See pages 152-155, and 168 of Fries (1905). Upon John Wesley‚Äôs return, the two journeyed with John T√∂ltschig to Marienborn, home of Zinzendorf, and Herrnhut for greater exposure to Moravian Christianity.See \\"Inghamites\\" and \\"Moravians\\" in Canney (1921).See page 245 of Spangenberg (1838). John Wesley was replaced by George Whitefield as Oglethorpe‚Äôs Chaplain to Georgia.See pages 16-23 of Smith (1877). Fetter Lane, the London influence James Hutton was a London bookseller who made the acquaintance of the Wesley brothers during their Oxford schooling. While sending John Wesley off on his Georgian mission, Hutton was transformed by the experience he had on board Simond with the Moravian Brethren. Hutton recorded the date in his memoirs as Tuesday, 14 October 1735[O.S.].See page 11 of Benham (1856). So moved was he by this experience with them that he formed a society which met weekly in his home to pray. They concluded each meeting with a reading of the latest Wesley correspondence describing the ongoing mission with the Moravian Brethren. In this way they practiced until John Wesley‚Äôs return to England in 1738. Inghamite Church, Salterforth. It was during this period that another young Moravian missionary, Peter Boehler, en route to America, was invited to one of these meetings at Fetter Lane. He had studied at the University of Jena and had been ordained by Count Zinzendorf. Peter‚Äôs inspiring presence transformed Hutton‚Äôs Society into \\"The Great Meeting House\\" which became the \\"First Religious Society in Fetter Lane, London\\". This 1738 event could be described as planting the seed of the Moravian Church in England. This gathering, or \\"Vestry Society\\", rightly considered themselves as part of the Church of England, and at times included members of the Holy Club. Peter Boehler established the rules he had learned under Zinzendorf, James Hutton presided, and Philip Henry Molther ministered. This society was repeatedly slandered for their \\"non-traditional\\" approach to Christianity. In response to the church doors being closed to their preaching, they shared the word in fields and on street corners to those who would listen. The Fetter Lane Society continued to grow and looked to the Moravian connection for recognition of their achievement. Spangenberg returned to London in November 1742 to elevate the status of the society at Fetter Lane. He recognized the \\"First Religious Society in Fetter Lane, London\\" as a full congregation of Brethren and after introducing them to the rules and Officers of the German Congregation referred to them as the \\"London Church\\". He saw this congregation as the union between the Moravian Church and the Church of England whose duty was to preach the Gospel.See page 186-88 of Hutton (1895). Spangenberg's words were echoed by Zinzendorf to this London Church upon his return from America in March 1743.See pages 318 and 319 of Spangenberg (1838). Return to Yorkshire, preaching Inghamite church, near Colne, Lancashire (closed 1992). Ingham returned to Yorkshire from his 1738 visit to Saxony where he reestablished his ministry in The North, primarily the countryside surrounding Wakefield, Leeds, and Halifax. The following summer the English clergy responded to the Methodists. Ingham, like his fellow ministers from Oxford, was forbidden to preach inside English churches, a condition that lasted some five years. These evangelists responded with open air preaching on street corners in London, and in the fields of Yorkshire to further the Gospel. Despite this opposition, Ingham strengthened his Moravian connection. T√∂ltschig made his first visit to Yorkshire in 1739. Boehler followed in 1741 upon his return from America.See pages 244 - 246 of Seymour (1840). The Fetter Lane society served as the nerve center for Methodist communications throughout England. As Wesleys' theological views shifted away from those of the United Brethren, the chapel at 32 Fetter Lane was turned over to them.See pages 41, 228 and 229 of Benham (1856). Marriage Ingham made the lasting acquaintance of a Lady Margaret Hastings upon his return to Yorkshire. They were married on 12 November 1741 [O.S.]. Following this union, he relocated his residence to Aberford.See pages 121 and 127 of Tyerman (1873). Beyond his personal life, Ingham cultivated tremendous growth from among his societies. He turned to Spangenberg, then residing in London, for help relinquishing personal control. Spangenberg immediately called for a pilgrimage. These settlers were organized along the lines of German communities in Herrnhut.See \\"Moravians\\" in Canney (1921).See pages 192 - 199 of Hutton (1895). In addition to Spangenberg, the list of Moravians that answered this call to Yorkshire included T√∂ltschig, Hutton and a great many others. This transfer of power strengthened the bond of trust between the Moravian Church and those English in communion with them on 30 July 1742 [O.S.]. Birth of a settlement Beyond Ingham‚Äôs societal reorganization, the Brethren needed land to farm. Zinzendorf‚Äôs 1743 visit to Yorkshire strengthened the fraternal bond with Ingham, who reciprocated to attend the Synod held in Vogtland later that year with his wife, Lady Margaret. The decision to purchase the property for the Fulneck pilgrim settlement was made at this Synod. Ingham purchased the Fallneck (or Fallen Oak) Estate in 1744 as a gift to the Brethren.See pages 111, 230, 234 and 268 of Benham (1856). This location was originally named Lamb‚Äôs Hill by Count Zinzendorf on one of his walks with Ingham. The foundation of Grace Hall, within the Fulneck settlement, was laid on 10 May 1746 with Br. T√∂ltschig leading the congregation in the ceremony. This building was followed by the girls' school in October 1749 and the boys' school in 1753.See pages 223 and 285 of Benham (1856). Among the listed workers was an Ignatius Ingham. While the Fulneck settlement developed, the United Brethren Church continued to press for recognition from Great Britain in order to safeguard their missionaries from military service in the United Kingdom and overseas. Ingham, Hutton, and Bell aided this cause when they attained an audience with the King to demonstrate the loyalty of the United Brethren on 27 April 1744.See pages 3 and 150 of Benham (1856). Benham indicated this event was not recorded in the usual manner. Parliament, with the firm backing of the Church of England, enacted legislation in 1749 championed by James Oglethorpe that recognized the \\"ancient Protestant Episcopal church\\" of these Moravian Brethren as being the same as their own.See pages 211 and 212 of Hutton (1895). While portions of this Act were subsequently repealed in 1867 (United States achieved independence in 1783), the recognition of the Brethren Church would remain intact. The Royal Assent was provided the following month. The vast support for this Act by both the House of Lords and Church of England indicate the positive press the Moravians garnered for all of their tireless efforts dating back to the 1732 Georgia mission.See pages 388-390 of Spangenberg (1835).See pages 193 and 194 of Cooper (1904).See page 542 of The Statutes: Revised Edition, Vol. II. (1871). Detachment By 1753 the leading Methodist personalities had distanced their theological views from those of the United Brethren. That same year, Count Zinzendorf‚Äôs Church suffered a credit crisis which severely strained what was left of those underlying friendships. This rift coincided with the end of Oglethorpe‚Äôs Charter to Georgia. Among the key issues during the transformation to a Crown colony were military service and slavery, both of which the Moravian Brethren opposed. Most of their settlements in Georgia had long since relocated to Pennsylvania. In response to this unfortunate situation, Ingham distanced himself and his societies from both the Moravian Church and the Church of England. He softened his initial demand for full payment of the land surrounding Grace Hall, to require only an annual rent for some 500 years.See pages 100, 123, and 124 of Tyerman (1873).See page 280 of Benham (1856). His followers were referred to as Inghamites.See page 198 of Fries (1905). Ingham considered reunification for his societies with his associates from Oxford, the Wesley brothers, in 1755, but was unable to get John Wesley‚Äôs full support. Later that year in Lancashire, Ingham was elected to the position of \\"General Overseer\\" of his societies,See page 138 of Tyerman (1873). with James Allen and William Batty chosen as his two principal helpers.See \\"Moravians\\" in Canney (1921). By that time, Ingham had near 80 flourishing congregations that viewed him as their head Pastor. In search of Inghamite church, Wheatley Lane, Lancashire. In 1759, Benjamin Ingham read Glas‚Äôs Testimony of the king of martyrs concerning his kingdom, and Sandeman's Letters on Theron and Aspasio.See pages 55-6 of Cantor (1991). Ingham, by way of correspondence with Glas and Sandeman, joined into discussion with them in an attempt to save his Inghamites through unification with congregations that most closely resembled those of the Moravian- Methodists he had established in Yorkshire. The following year, Ingham sent two of his ministers, James Allen and William Batty, on a discreet mission to Scotland to learn first-hand about Glasite practices. They formally reported to Ingham in October 1761. While their report swayed the conference decision from Methodism to Sandemanianism, they could not agree on the specifics of this transformation as Ingham intended to maintain his position as \\"General Overseer\\".See page 145 of Tyerman (1873). The resulting split left Batty supporting Ingham, neither of whom was willing to fully convert. The formal conversion would mean confessing their faith amongst a Sandemanian (or Glasite) congregation and being accepted as members of that community.See pages 43, 44, and 47 of Cantor (1991).See page 83 of Smith (2008). Allen returned to Scotland, converted, became an Elder, returned to Yorkshire as a missionary, and converted several Inghamite congregations to Sandemanianism.See pages 84-5 of Smith (2008). Through visitation by their elders, Sandemanians maintained an even handed discipline. Ingham‚Äôs congregations continued to act in an independent manner. They lacked the unifying organizational structure inherent in either the Moravian or the elder-led Sandemanian congregations. In the absence of such discipline, the Inghamite societies have slowly unraveled and have nearly been overtaken by Methodism, Sandemanianism, Congregationalism and others. In 1762, Ingham was elected an elder to the Church at Tadcaster, and continued in the office of \\"General Overseer\\" until his parting.See page 152 of Tyerman (1873). At the age of 60, Benjamin Ingham died in 1772, some four years after his wife, Lady Margaret, at Aberford. By 1863, the number of Inghamite chapels had been reduced to half a dozen. there remain but two active Inghamite chapels located at Salterforth and Wheatley Lane.

General description  The MAP75 consists of an all-welded body with a fully enclosed troop compartment built on a modified Mercedes-Benz 7.5 ton Series LA1113/42 truck chassis ('Rodef 45').Touchard, Guerre dans le bush! Les blind√©s de l'Arm√©e rhod√©sienne au combat (1964-1979), p. 73. Adapted from the Crocodile Armoured Personnel Carrier, the open-topped hull or 'capsule' is faceted at the sides, which were designed to deflect small-arms' rounds, and a flat deck reinforced by a v-shaped 'crush box' meant to deflect landmine blasts. Three inverted U-shaped 'roll bars' shorter than those on the Crocodile were fitted to protect the fighting compartment from being crushed in case the vehicle turned and roll over after a mine detonation. However, the reduced height of the 'roll bars' often hampered the crew's movements inside the vehicle, though the problem was rectified only in the post-war Zimbabwean versions by fitting higher bars. Access to the vehicle's interior is made by means of two medium-sized doors at the vertical hull rear whilst two square hatches placed low at the hull sides allowed for rapid debussing, an innovation that reflected the vehicle's combat offensive role. Protection The hull was made of ballistic 10mm mild steel plate; front windscreen and side windows had 40mm bullet-proof laminated glass. Armament Rhodesian MAP75s were usually armed with a FN MAG-58 7.62mm Light Machine Gun (LMG), sometimes installed on a locally produced one-man MG armoured turret to protect the gunner. Vehicles assigned to convoy escorting duties ('E-type') had a Browning M1919A4 7.62mm medium machine gun mounted on an open-topped, cylinder-shaped turret (dubbed 'the dustbin'). Twin Browning MG pintle mounts placed behind the driver‚Äôs compartment were often added on 'Seven fives' employed for 'externals'.

After independence, the MAP75 entered service with the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) in early 1980 and equipped both the 1st and 2nd Battalions, RAR, which participated in the large military exercises conducted at Somabula Plain, Matabeleland that same year. ZNA's 'Seven Fives' were thrown into action in November 1980 against ZIPRA troops at the 1st Battle of Entumbane and later at the February 1981 2nd Battle of Entumbane (near Bulawayo, Matabeleland), and later again after February 1982 by helping to put down the Super-ZAPU insurgency in Matabeleland. During the Mozambican Civil War, 'Seven Fives' were also employed by the ZNA forces in Mozambique guarding the Mutare-Beira oil pipeline in 1982-1993 from RENAMO guerrilla attacks.

Some of the primary ones are: * Polyethylene ‚Äì The most common plastic film is made of one of the varieties of polyethylene: low- density polyethylene, medium-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, or linear low-density polyethylene. * Polypropylene ‚Äì Polypropylene can be made a cast film, biaxially oriented film (BOPP), or as a uniaxially oriented film. * Polyester ‚Äì BoPET is a biaxially oriented polyester film * Nylon * Polyvinyl chloride ‚Äì film can be with or without a Plasticizer * Cellulose acetate - an early bioplastic * Cellophane - made of regenerated cellulose * A variety of bioplastics and biodegradable plastics are available. * Semiembossed film ‚Äì Semiembossed film can be used as a liner to the calendered rubber to retain the properties of rubber and also to prevent dust and other foreign matters from sticking to the rubber while calendering and during storage Processes A tube of extruded film being blown to expand Plastic films are usually thermoplastics and are formed by melting for forming the film. * Cast ‚Äì Plastics extrusion can cast film which is cooled or quenched then wound up on a roll. * Extruded film can be stretched, thinned, or oriented in one or two directions. Blown or tubular process forces air into an extruded ring to expand the film. Flat tenter frames stretch the extruded film before annealing. * Calender rolls can be used to form film from hot polymers * Solution deposition is another film forming process. * Skiving is used to scrape off a film from a solid core (sometimes used to make PTFE thread seal tape) * Coextrusion involves extruding two or more layers of dissimilar polymers into a single film * Lamination combines two or more films (or other materials) into a sandwich. * Extrusion coating is used to form a film onto another film or substrate Further processing Plastic films are typically formed into rolls by roll slitting. Often additional coating or printing operations are also used. Films can be modified by physical vapor deposition to make metallised films. Films can be subjected to corona treatment or Plasma processing; films can have release agents applied as needed.

It was written in 2008 by a group of library directors from law schools in the United States. Background and development In 2007, Richard Danner presented two different papers arguing that John Willinsky's open access principles were also applicable to legal scholarship and information. He also presented information on the work Duke University School of Law had done to improve electronic access to journals and faculty scholarship. In October 2008, Danner met with library directors from 11 other law schools at Duke's campus in Durham, North Carolina to discuss the topic. The resulting statement issued by the group called for all law schools to stop publishing their law journals in print format and to rely instead on open access electronic publication coupled with a commitment to keep the electronic versions available in stable, open, digital formats. An important motivation underlying this call was not only improving access, but also that \\"very few law journals receive enough in subscription income and royalties to cover their costs of operation.\\" Response and legacy In a discussion of the Durham Statement published two years after it was issued, Danner noted that \\"[the] call to end print publication of law reviews was more controversial than that regarding open access.\\" Law librarians have raised questions about the ability to effectively digitally preserve materials and whether the \\"stable, open, digital formats\\" the statement suggests are more of an ideal than an attainable goal.

It received its wide release on March 12, 2010. Plot Marcus Boyd (Lance Gross), a young African-American, has recently graduated from Columbia Medical School and is headed to Laos for a year to work with Doctors Without Boarders. Lucia Ramirez (America Ferrera), who is Mexican-American, volunteers at a charter school for recent immigrants as an English teacher, having dropped out of Columbia Law School to pursue her passion, although she has neglected to tell her parents. Unbeknownst to their respective families, they have been living together for several months and are planning to wed before heading to Laos together. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, Marcus' father Brad (Forest Whitaker), a successful radio host, is returning from a typical one-night-stand with a younger woman when he sees his car being towed by Miguel (Carlos Mencia), who happens to be Lucia's father and runs a successful auto shop and towing business. Brad tries unsuccessfully to halt the tow by holding on to the door of his car. Both Miguel and Brad hurl various racially based insults at one another. That night, Marcus and Lucia invite their families to a joint dinner, where Miguel is surprised to learn of Marcus's existence, and Brad brings a much younger date who is in fact an old high school friend of Lucia's. As a shock to both families, the couple reveal their engagement and travel plans, with Brad and Miguel incredulous that they will soon be in-laws. As the wedding planning begins, both families attempt to dominate it with their respective traditions, while Brad's long-time friend Angie helps to mediate things, stressing the phrase \\"Our marriage, their wedding\\" to Marcus and Lucia to help them understand how much they must compromise to keep peace between their loved ones. The wedding is set to take place at Brad's estate, much to his chagrin, and Brad tries to dissuade Marcus from rushing into a marriage as he feels he did with Marcus's mother. Meanwhile, Miguel feels that Marcus is not good enough for Lucia because she did not feel comfortable enough to mention him before the engagement. While out dress shopping, Lucia's sister Isabel (Anjelah Johnson), who helps run the auto shop with Miguel, argues with Lucia about marrying young like their other sisters, something they vowed not to do as teenagers. Their mother Sonia overhears their conversation, which quickly shifts to mocking her life as a homemaker who is clearly living vicariously through the wedding, which upsets her. While out to secure a DJ for the reception, Miguel and Brad become drunk at a club and get arrested after an altercation. When Marcus and Lucia go to pick them up from the station, an argument erupts in which Miguel feels that Marcus is freeloading off of Lucia since he will be working as a doctor without pay and still believes that she is becoming a lawyer. When Lucia does not come to his defense, Marcus feels abandoned, leading to another argument between them. When Lucia questions if Marcus still wants to get married, he replies \\"I don't know\\", which leads her to call off the nuptials. Angered when Sonia refers to the wedding as \\"our wedding\\" and Miguel offers to \\"toss the ball\\" at the news, Lucia finally admits all the secrets she has been keeping from her parents, leaving them shocked. Brad and Angie have begun seeing each other after a lifetime of friendship, which ends quickly once Angie sees another one-night-stand in Brad's home. Marcus and Brad have a sincere conversation while attempting to cope with their mutual loss and help each other realize how much they truly love their significant others. Miguel assures Lucia that he will always love and be proud of her as long as she is honest with him, and only wants her to be happy. He also gifts a classic lowrider he was renovating for Lucia as a graduation/wedding gift to Sonia to apologize for how he has let their marriage stagnate, assuring her he will always find her attractive and want to have fun with her. Isabel helps Lucia realize that she still loves Marcus, and pushes her to reunite with him. Lucia goes to Brad's home and tries to serenade Marcus, saying she is happy to marry Marcus in a way that is only for them, while Marcus apologizes for making her feel she must choose between him and her family. The day of the wedding arrives, and events quickly turn chaotic as the extended families begin to clash, while Miguel and Brad finally seem to be working together for their children's happiness. Just before the ceremony begins, Marcus asks Miguel for Lucia's hand in marriage as a gesture of good will, which Miguel grants as a sign of respect and acceptance. The ceremony honors traditions from both families, and the reception becomes a joyous occasion. Brad makes an attempt to atone with Angie, apologizing for threatening their relationship and not pursuing her long ago, and promising to commit to her. Marcus and Lucia share a dance, happy that they are married and that their families have found a way to be together. During the end credits, several pictures of the two families are shown depicting family events, including Isabel's engagement to Harry (Harry Shum Jr.), who is Asian-American, while Miguel is seen weeping at the troubles ahead.

The Tristan Quilt, sometimes called the Tristan and Isolde Quilt or the Guicciardini Quilt, is one of the earliest surviving quilts in the world.The Tristan and Isolde Quilt. Accessed 7-02-2010 Depicting scenes from the story of Tristan and Isolde, an influential romance and tragedy, it was made in Sicily during the second half of the 14th century.The Tristan Quilt in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Accessed 5-2-2010 There are at least two extant sections of the quilt, one of which is displayed in the Victoria and Albert Museum's Medieval and Renaissance Galleries, and the other in the Bargello in Florence. A third quilt, also depicting Tristan and Isolde, but not thought to be part of the V&A; and Bargello examples, is held in private hands. The Tristan Quilts are the only known surviving examples of medieval quilts. Material and construction Detail of a knight's hands and arms. Surface wear has exposed the wadding beneath. The quilt is made from two layers of linen, stitched together with wadding in between. Backstitch in cream and brown linen thread defines a series of pictures with captions that have been brought into relief by inserting rolls of cotton stuffing to raise sections of the design, a technique known as trapunto. The stuffing could have been introduced during the quilting process, or because the backing layer is looser in weave, its threads could have been parted to introduce the stuffing; some elements are done using cord quilting. Subjects Detail of Tristan from scene 7 Detail of King Mark from scene 7 Detail of rowers from scene 8 The imagery on the quilt resembles the narrative of chapters 17‚Äì19 of a 14th-century novella, La Tavola Rotonda o L'Istoria di Tristano, which describes the oppression of Cornwall by Languis of Ireland and his champion Amoroldo (a variation on \\"Morholt\\"), and the battle of Tristan on behalf of King Mark of Cornwall. The foliage on the quilt includes ivy and grape vines, a reference to the plants that grew and intertwined from the tombs of the doomed Tristan and Isolde. The scenes on the V&A; quilt are not in their original order, having been re- arranged at some point. Each scene has a caption in the Sicilian language. There are six scenes in the central section of the V&A; quilt, with a border of four-leaf clovers: : 1: Morholt, bearing a fleur-de-lis shield, is shown shooting with a bow whilst on horseback in a boat. A page rows the boat. Caption: ' (\\"How the Morholt wounded Tristan\\") : 2: A castle with a king and queen and a third person looking out, possibly Languis and Lotta and their daughter Isolde waiting for Morholt. Partial caption: ' (\\"...in Ireland\\") : 3: Tristan, with a three-horned shield, fights Morholt on an island. Caption: ' (\\"How Tristan wounded Morholt in the head\\") : 4: A page with a saddled horse. Caption: ' (\\"How the Morholt's page waited for his master\\") : 5: A ship being pushed away by Tristan's foot. Caption: ' (\\"How Tristan struck his boat behind him into the sea\\") : 6: Tristan with his horse and shield. Caption: ' (\\"How Tristan awaits Morholt on the isle Sanza Ventura in the sea\\") There are also eight scenes in the border. Along the lower edge are two scenes: : 7: Mark of Cornwall receives a letter from two kneeling ambassadors while Tristan stands behind them. Caption:' (\\"How the ambassadors are come to King Mark for the tribute of seven years\\") : 8: The ambassadors, in a ship rowed by soldiers and bearing a fleur-de-lis banner. Caption: ' (\\"How Languis sent to Cornwall for the tribute\\") On the left side, from the top: : 9: A ship, bearing fleur-de- lis banners with a man blowing a boatswain's call in the poop deck. Caption: ' (\\"How Morholt came to Cornwall with forty galleys\\") : 10: Tristan giving his glove to Morholt. Caption: ' (\\"How Tristan gives the glove of battle to Morholt\\") : 11: A Cornish noble paying money to seven of Morholt's men. Caption: ' (\\"How Morholt made the people pay\\") On the right side, from the top: : 12: A ship bearing a fleur-de-lis banner with Morholt in the poop deck with a man blowing a boatswain's call. Caption: ' (\\"How Morholt comes to Cornwall\\") : 13: King Languis, with three nobles behind him, gives a letter to two kneeling ambassadors, while Morholt stands behind them. Caption: ' (\\"How King Languis ordered that the host should go to Cornwall\\") : 14: Morholt, with a mace, with a herald blowing a trumpet. Caption: ' (\\"How Morholt made the host go to Cornwall\\") The Bargello quilt has eight scenes and is made from three longitudinal strips joined together. Some of the scenes on the Bargello quilt portray Tristan leaving his foster-father's court to go to Mark of Cornwall; the meeting of Tristan with Morholt for combat; and their fight on horseback. A third quilt in a private collection, thought to be from the same atelier but not actually part of these two quilts, includes a central medallion showing Tristan and Isolde on a field of fleur de lis. Dimensions The V&A; quilt measures 320 cm high by 287 cm wide. These measurements were verified in 2006 when it was prepared for display in the new Medieval and Renaissance Galleries. The Bargello quilt measures 2.47m high by 2.07m wide. Purpose Recent research has suggested that the quilts were made as a pair of wall hangings, and subsequently altered. Some sources state that there was a third quilt, believed to have been made for the royal Capetian House of Anjou. This third fragment, known as the Pianetti or Azzolini quilt, is in private hands and is thought to come from the same source as the V&A; and Bargello quilts. The textile historian Sarah Randles argues that the two quilts were originally one large quilt, measuring a monumental 6 metres high by 4 metres wide, and that significant sections are missing. Randles' plan for the quilt suggests that the scenes would have been arranged clockwise in the border, with the central images paired and reading bottom to top. Ultraviolet light tests on the Bargello quilt revealed traces of calcium on the reverse, which could have come from its use as a wall hanging, though such use may not have been the original intention. History Tristan's shield with three hunting horns. It was long believed that the quilts were made to be given as a wedding gift to Pietro di Luigi Guicciardini and Laodomia Acciaiuli in 1395. although recent research suggests an earlier date. The three hunting horns on Tristan's shield are the coat of arms of the Guicciardini family. The inventories of the Guicciardini family do not include a definitive reference to the quilts, but do mention \\"three quilted bedcovers\\". The V&A; quilt, according to its museum number (1391-1904), was acquired in 1904. The Bargello acquired their quilt in July 1927 from Count Paolo Guicciardini, to whose family it is believed the quilt had always belonged.

(ProQuest subscription required) Retrieved 7 February 2010 Biography Heiliger began his artistic education with an apprenticeship as a stone carver and a course of study at the Stettiner Werkschule f√ºr Gestaltende Arbeiten from 1933-36 under Kurt Schwerdtfeger, who had been a student of the Bauhaus. After this he attended the Staatlichen Hochschule f√ºr bildende K√ºnste (National College of Visual Arts) in 1938, where he studied under Arno Breker. In 1941 he was drafted into the army and served as a radio operator on the Eastern Front for two years, before he received an exemption from military service through the intervention of Breker. Despite this he was drafted again in 1944, after which he fled as a deserter through northern Germany. In May 1946 Heiliger exhibits with the painter Fritz Ascher at the Karl Buchholz Gallery in Berlin. Heiliger's design for the Memorial to Unknown Political Prisoners (1953) brought him his first international recognition, earning him the Prize of the National Government and a prize from the Institute of Contemporary Arts. This was followed by his participation in several prominent international exhibits, such as the documenta I & II in Kassel (1955 and 1959) and the Venice Biennale (1956), and by commissions such as sculptures for the German pavilion at the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels. In 1956 he became a member of the Berlin Academy of Art. In 1974 he was recognized with the Federal Cross of Merit, and in 1984 was awarded an honorary membership in the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund. He died in Berlin in 1995, and was buried in Berlin's Dahlem Cemetery (Friedhof Dahlem). Work Heiliger's diverse output stretches from his early, organically abstracted figures to his late nonobjective, geometric abstractions. His early work (1945‚Äì1962), focuses on the human figure, which is treated in an organic style influenced by Aristide Maillol and Henry Moore. Also from this period is a series of portrait busts of prominent contemporary Germans. The artist departed from the human figure in his second period (1962‚Äì1970), instead developing imagery of the \\"flight of birds and vegetable forms\\"Ulrike Lehmann. \\"Heiliger, Bernhard.\\" Grove Art Online.

The seven-meter-high The Flame (Flamme, 1962‚Äì63), commissioned by the city of Berlin for Ernst-Reuter-Platz, is considered the key work in the transition between the early and middle periods. The Five Continents (Die f√ºnf Erdteile, 1961), by contrast, still alludes to the human figure in the torso-like shapes that make up the composition. Kosmos 70, commissioned in 1970 by the city of Berlin for the restored Reichstag building, marks the transition into Heiliger's final period, where spheres and angular forms linked by lines of wire allude to planets and solar systems. The different stylistic phases in Heiliger's career are connected to changes in material: whereas his works from the 1950s and 1960s are cast materials, such as cast stone or bronze, the works from the 1970s onward are most often made of stainless steel or corten steel.

The first Bah√° º√≠ to visit the island was Mrs. Harriet Gibbs Marshall, from 1922‚Äì1928. Another early Bah√° º√≠ to visit Haiti was Leonora Armstrong in 1927. After that, others visited Haiti, and by January 1937 Louis George Gregory visited the island and cited the presence of a small community of Bah√° º√≠s. The first long term pioneers, Ruth and Ellsworth Blackwell, arrived in 1940. Following their arrival the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly of Haiti was formed in 1942 in Port-au- Prince. From 1951 the Haitian Bah√° º√≠s participated in regional organizations of the religion until 1961 when Haitian Bah√° º√≠s elected their own National Spiritual Assembly and soon took on goals reaching out into neighboring islands. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 23,000 Bah√° º√≠s in Haiti in 2005, and about the same in 2010.  Early phase   ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916‚Äì1917; these letters were compiled together in a book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention Latin American regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919‚Äîafter the end of the First World War and the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919. > His Christ Holiness says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the world > and summon the people to the Kingdom of God.‚Ä¶(travel to) the Islands of the > West Indies, such as Cuba, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, the Islands of the > Lesser Antilles, Bahama Islands, even the small Watling Island, have great > importance‚Ä¶ In 1922 Harriet Gibbs Marshall accompanied her husband to Haiti, where he was sent by President Warren G. Harding to be a part of the U.S. legation. They lived there for six years, during which time she founded the Jean Joseph Industrial School in Port-au-Prince and worked extensively with Haitian social welfare charities. She had been a Baha'i since 1912 and is famous for having provided the venue for the first integrated Baha'i Feast in the Southern United States at her 902 T Street Music School. She also opened schools serving those of African Descent in Kentucky in 1900 and DC in 1902. Five years later, Leonora Armstrong visited Haiti in 1927 as part of her plan to complement and complete Martha Root's unfulfilled intention of visiting all the Latin American countries for the purpose of presenting the religion to an audience. In 1929 Keith Ransom-Kehler visited Haiti.  Seven Year Plan and succeeding decades  Shoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, wrote a cable on May 1, 1936 to the Bah√° º√≠ Annual Convention of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s vision to begin. In his cable he wrote: > Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° > in Tablets of the Divine Plan. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming > National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of > Bah√° º√≠ Era drawing to a close.

Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. > Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in > American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace > the light of the Faith of Bah√° ºu'll√°h and establish structural basis of His > World Order. Following the May 1 cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent pioneers to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Bah√° º√≠ National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bah√° º√≠ North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bah√° º√≠s to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois. In 1937 the First Seven Year Plan (1937‚Äì44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bah√° º√≠s the goal of establishing the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in every country in Latin America.  Establishment  Just before this plan was announced, the next Bah√° º√≠s to visit were Louis George Gregory and his wife, who could speak French, in January 1937. While there they had a chance to meet Oswald Garrison Villard. Gregory indicated a community of at least 5 active members who had French translations of Some Answered Questions, and that the community was refused permission to hold public meetings. Several Bah√° º√≠s then made stops of varying lengths in Haiti. Ruth and Ellsworth Blackwell are noted as pioneers starting around 1940. By 1941 three converts to the religion include Mr. and Mrs. McBean and Muriel Johnson, a Jamaican couple and niece. The first Local Spiritual Assembly of Haiti was formed in 1942 in Port-au-Prince. Further translations, including the Will and Testament of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, arrived later in 1942. The Blackwells left by July 1943 though the community continued functioning. Word is received of two converts, Royer Dejean and Andre Paul, by January 1944. In 1943 writer and Bah√° º√≠ Alain Locke was on leave as Inter-American exchange Professor to Haiti under the joint auspices of the American Committee for Inter-American Artistic and Intellectual Relations and the Haitian Ministry of Education. Towards the end of his stay there, President √âlie Lescot personally decorated Locke with the National Order of Honour and Merit, grade of Commandeur. In March 1946 Dr. Malcolm King moved to Haiti. By August there were some 20 Bah√° º√≠s in Port-au-Prince and the assembly was able to register with the national government. King moved away in 1947 while other pioneers move to Haiti. In early 1948 a Latin American Congress was called in Mexico to coordinate institutional growth across the region and the delegate from Haiti was Martial Coulange. In late 1948 Gayle Woolson and early 1949 Louise Caswell each were able to travel through Haiti communities like Saint Marc and elsewhere and gave public talks. By 1949 Bah√° º√≠s of Port-au-Prince had a working center which served to have children and adult oriented events including classes, free medical, dental, and legal services as well as chances to hear about the religion. The Blackwell's returned to Haiti in 1950.  Growth   Internationally  From the early period of development the Bah√° º√≠ community in Haiti grew in relation to its regional neighbors as well as internally. The Bah√° º√≠s of the region of northern Latin America were first organized under the regional national assembly of Central America, Mexico and the Antilles from 1951. The inaugural convention was witnessed by Hand of the Cause Dorothy Beecher Baker at which the Bah√° º√≠s of Haiti were assigned two delegates from its local assembly of Port-au-Prince. Then Haitian Bah√° º√≠s were assigned to the regional assembly of the Greater Antilles from 1957 until 1961, when the Haitian Bah√° º√≠s elected their own National Spiritual Assembly with Hand of the Cause Ugo Giachery representing the Bah√° º√≠ International Community. The members of the first National Spiritual Assembly of Haiti were: Eustace Bailey, Alcide Narcisse, Jean Desert, Joseph Albert Bajeux, Ellsworth Blackwell, Andr√© St. Louis, Joseph C. Pierre, Ruth Blackwell, and Circ√© Brantome. In 1963 the Bah√° º√≠s of the world looked to the election of the Universal House of Justice as the new head of the religion. The delegates for the international convention were the members of the national assemblies then in existence. The members of the Haitian National Assembly who participated in the election were: Eustace Bailey, Odette Benjamin, Ellsworth Blackwell, Ruth Blackwell, Circe Brantome, Jean Desert, Alcide Narcisse, Speline Posy, Andr√© St. Louis (all of whom voted in absentia). In 1964 Haitian Bah√° º√≠s were then given goal areas to spread the religion including Barbuda, St. Kitts-Nevis, Saba, St. Eustatis, St. Martin, Guadeloupe, Antigua and Martinique. In 1965 Guadeloupe and Martinique had families from Haiti pioneer there while members of the national assembly attended a Honduran conference on the progress of the religion there. Over the next few years pioneers from Haiti went to Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic, and Dahomey (now called Benin) followed by Dominica in 1971 \\\\- Hand of the Cause,  ªAl√≠-Muhammad Varq√°, offered a conference workshop on pioneering at the Amelia Collins Bah√° º√≠ School at Liancourt later in 1971.  Internally  Internally in 1953 Guillermo Aguilar, former chairman of the Lima, Peru local assembly, directed the establishment of a technological school for Haiti on behalf of the United Nations and took several opportunities for talks on the religion and the United Nations. In 1955 the regional assembly began publishing a National Bulletin which would be published in English, Spanish and French. 1956 was a year of several developments in Haiti. The first local assembly of Cap-Ha√Øtien was elected in April and traveling Bah√° º√≠s visited communities across Haiti. The national center was acquired in February and dedicated in May. 1956 also marked the first national conference on the progress of the religion - members of four cities of Haiti were represented. By 1957 the Blackwells had again returned to Haiti for a shorter stay. In 1958 a United Nations Day celebration was set by the Bah√° º√≠s at which some 70 non-Bah√° º√≠s attended and Bah√° º√≠ marriage ceremonies were accepted legally. In 1958 Haiti hosted the convention to elect the regional assembly of the Greater Antilles as well as the first international school of the Antilles with attendees from Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Haiti. Hand of the Cause Ugo Giachery and then US National Assembly member Glenford Mitchell met with the Antillees assembly as well as giving talks in February 1959 in Haiti. Two conferences on the progress of the religion as well as international schools were again held in Haiti and another set in the Dominican republic were held in 1960 \\\\- the Haitian school having Giachery, Mitchell and others giving talks. Public talks on the religion were held in Port-au-Prince and Liancourt. The Blackwells again returned to Haiti November 1960. An organized campaign in 1962 used techniques learned in Africa (see Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Uganda for example) establishing communities of dozens of Bah√° º√≠s. In 1963 there were Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assemblies in 10 towns including Cap-Ha√Øtien, Port-au-Prince, and Saint-Marc - a registered group of Bah√° º√≠s in P√©tion-Ville and isolated Bah√° º√≠s in 5 other locations.The Bah√° º√≠ Faith: 1844-1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bah√° º√≠ Teaching & Consolidation Plan 1953-1963, Compiled by Hands of the Cause Residing in the Holy Land, page 88. The 1964 national convention had 19 delegates from across Haiti representing thirteen local assemblies. In 1969 Ellswoorth Blackwell was able to present a talk to the Toastmasters International club on the subject of \\"Equality of the Sexes.\\" In December 1976 a traveling Bah√° º√≠ from France, Andre Brugiroux, visited Haiti for a weeklong tour and was able to show a film of his at the Haitian French Institute on two occasions for an audience ultimately of some 670 people. In 1977 secretaries and treasurers of more than half the local assemblies of Haiti were gathered for a one-day institute conducted in the Creole language by native believers about assembly functions. The 1979 national convention had 49 delegates present to elect the national assembly. In 1989 the leadership of the Haitian Cayemites island's population made a decision to adopt the religion for the island and a school was established in 1989.  Socio- economic development projects  Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. In 1978-9 articles relating to International Year of the Child were placed by Bah√° º√≠s in national and local newspapers and three radio stations in Haiti carried announcements of public meetings. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. In December 1983 the national assembly registered with the government as an NGO. Bah√° º√≠s were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bah√° º√≠ teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bah√° º√≠ socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In 1980, the Haitian Bah√° º√≠ community started an elementary school (An√≠s Zun√∫z√≠), later joined by a forest protection program, and a variety of village kindergartens.  An√≠s Zun√∫z√≠ Bah√° º√≠ School  The An√≠s Zun√∫z√≠ Bah√° º√≠ School is a Bah√° º√≠ School near Port-au-Prince which first began to hold classes in 1980. In October 1982 R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum, a Hand of the Cause, a position of prominence in the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, presided at the official inauguration ceremony for the school. The initial board of directors were Counsellor Farzam Arbab, Dr. Nabil Hanna, Benjamin Levy, Dr. Iraj Majzub and Georges Marcellus. It reached the point of offering classes K through 10th grade. The student population comes mostly from no to low-income families, and most students are only paying minimal or no fees to attend the school. It follows the national curriculum but also provides moral education and English classes. It is situated on about three acres of land in what has become a suburb several miles north east of Port-au-Prince proper (and a few north west of Croix-des-Bouquets.) More recently the whole area has been built up with both private homes and businesses. More recently the Mona Foundation has supported the school with funding for support of satellite schools, scholarships, regular summer camps, and general funding as well as acting as a mediator of larger scale funding for infrastructure improvements.  CAFT (Centre d'apprentissage et de Formation pour la Transformation) Program  Another Bah√° º√≠ development program in Haiti, CAFT (Centre d'apprentissage et de Formation pour la Transformation) Program, is also supported by the Mona Foundation, which offers teacher-training programs in cooperation with other NGOs helping schools across Haiti and is registered with the Haitian Ministry of Social Affairs and is authorized to function as a training agency by the Ministry of Education. Its projects began in 2000 with Plan International, then YELE Haiti 2005‚Äì6, UNICEF 2006, 2007 and currently is managing the training component of the Rewriting the Future project of Save the Children (2008‚Äì2010).  Modern community  A decade of collaboration was developed between a village and a network of people in the United States through Bah√° º√≠ contacts. Others had made trips recently as part of a documentary on Bah√° º√≠ efforts in Haiti. Two of the schools recently added include New Horizon School, which is run by Bernard Martinod, a French architect, outside Port-au-Prince that serves some of the small villages in the area, and the Georges Marcellus School in the rural village of Gureot. The government of Haiti voted in favor of a United Nations General Assembly Resolution on the \\"Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran\\" (UN document no. A/C.3/56/L.50) on 19 December 2001. See Persecution of Bah√° º√≠s. Various Bah√° º√≠s continue to explore Haiti as a place to offer services. In 2007, following the United Nations' adoption of the \\"Draft Guiding Principles on Extreme poverty and Human Rights\\", the Bah√° º√≠ International Community organized local consultations with Bah√° º√≠ communities in Haiti and several other countries around the world in order to draw out their perspectives on the meaning and experience of poverty, and its connection to human rights in order to provide its comment on the Draft Guiding Principles and submitted to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.  After the 2010 Haiti earthquake  The United States National Spiritual Assembly directed prayers to be offered at the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship, posted messages about individuals, and commented on the spiritual import of such events from the Bah√° º√≠ writings: > \\"... When such a crisis sweeps over the world no person should hope to > remain intact. We belong to an organic unit and when one part of the > organism suffers all the rest of the body will feel its consequence. This is > in fact the reason why Baha'u'llah calls our attention to the unity of > mankind. But as Bah√° º√≠s we should not let such hardship weaken our hope in > the future... \\"Bahai.us: Prayers for Haiti . Quotation from a letter written > on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to a Bah√° º√≠ family, April 14, 1932. Prayers and raising donations were also offered at the Green Acre Bah√° º√≠ School. News of the Bah√° º√≠s as of January 16 reported that the community was generally accounted for with no deaths. The principal of Anis Zununi school in 2010 reported on January 17 on Facebook that the school was generally still standing and its staff and others with CAFT were cooperating in relief efforts and sharing space and support with neighbors. A clinic was run at the Zunuzi school by a medical team from the United States and Canada.  Demographics  The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 23,055 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005, and about the same in 2010. The Institut Ha√Øtien de Statistique et d'Informatique does not offer breakdowns of religions for 5% of the Haitian population, and the only non- Christian group mentioned are the Haitian Vodou (aka Vodouisant.)

First, the distaste for the simple and life; secondly, repugnance to suffering of any kind; thirdly, the forgetfulness of the future life. \\"[W]e have constantly besought citizens who were conspicuous by genius, industry, family, or fortune, to join together in common counsel and action to safeguard and to promote whatever would tend to the strength and well-being of the community.\\"Pope Leo XIII, Laetitiae sanctae, September 8, 1893, Libreria Editrice Vaticana \\"We deplore ‚Ä¶ the growing contempt of those homely duties and virtues which make up the beauty of humble life.\\" He sees a disdain of the simple life leading to jealousy, the trampling of rights, \\"...and finally, the people, betrayed in their expectations, attack public order, and place themselves in conflict with those who are charged to maintain it.\\" \\"People come to see happiness and comfort as things to which they are entitled, rather than things to work for.\\"Pope, Charles. \\"Three Insights of Pope Leo XIII That Diagnose Our Cultural Malaise\\", Community in Mission, Archdiocese of Washington D.C., June 11, 2018 Pope Leo offers, in contrast, the House of Nazareth, contemplated in the Joyful Mysteries as \\"an all-perfect model of domestic society!\\" \\"While one can and should try to address unnecessary hazards and seek to ease one another‚Äôs burdens, suffering, sorrows, accidents, and difficulties are all part of life.\\" \\"An abhorrence of all that is inconvenient or hard to endure leads people to avoid doing what is right. Leo finds support for the virtues of patience and fortitude in a consideration of the Sorrowful Mysteries.\\" Leo noted that even the pagan world \\"recognized that this life was not a home but a dwelling-place, not our destination, but a stage in the journey. But men of our day, ...pursue the false goods of this world in such wise that the thought of their true Fatherland of enduring happiness is not only set aside, but, to their shame be it said, banished and entirely erased from their memory\\". He recommended contemplation of the Glorious Mysteries, from which one learns that death is not an annihilation which ends all things, but merely a migration and passage from life to life.\\" In Laetitiae Sanctae Leo enumerated the three causes of evils in his era: \\"There are three influences which appear to Us to have the chief place in effecting this downgrade movement of society. These are -- first, the distaste for a simple and laborious life; secondly, repugnance to suffering of any kind; thirdly, the forgetfulness of the future life.\\" The \\"repugnance to suffering\\" found sympathy in those who supported the utopian life popular in 1893 in which \\"they dream of a chimeric civilization in which all that is unpleasant shall be removed, and all that is pleasant shall be supplied.\\" See also * List of encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII * Rosary devotions and spirituality * List of encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII on the Rosary References External links * Vatican website: Laetitiae sanctae Category:1893 documents Category:1893 in Christianity Category:September 1893 events Category:Rosary Category:Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII ","title":"Laetitiae sanctae"},{"id":"26112706","text":"ISFuel Inc.

The company was acquired in January 2007 by Hastings International, Cura√ßao, Netherlands Antilles, a company managed by a corporate services provider called HBM Group. Caribbean 21 controversy In 2004 the company hit the news when a player won $1.3 million from a $1,000 deposit, playing Caribbean 21 for high stakes at Hampton Casino. The same player also won $96,000 at Delano casino, another RTG-powered site. The player was accused of cheating by the casino, who said he used a robot (automated playing program), and that he would not be paid.NBC News Bettor wins $1.3 million; Net casino won't pay Since the game has a casino advantage (albeit a low advantage, somewhere over 0.1%http://wizardofodds.com/caribbean21), the casino should still have held the edge, though good luck can overcome an edge in the short and medium-term. The details of the player's final settlement with the casino were never published. RTG subsequently limited the maximum bet size of the game to $5, before removing it entirely. Operators One of the largest RTG casino operators was the Crystal Palace group, mooted for a ¬£140m flotation on London's AIM market in 2005. The group, owned by South African Warren Cloud, made a pre-tax profit that year of ¬£20.4m. Cloud's casinos were the subject of numerous complaints particularly overpayment of players who accepted bonuses from the casino. Cloud died suddenly on his yacht off Ibiza in July 2008, aged 34. Aside from the Crystal Palace group, other RTG casinos have been the subject of criticism. The Casinomeister website maintains a list of RTG casinos, which lists several sites as 'rogue'. Software features The company indicates that operators are not able to choose between payout settings for their slots and video poker games. They have expressed intentions to limit operator liability for a single game to $50,000 by default, by reducing maximum bet sizes. Some RTG casinos offer progressive jackpot games with jackpots that are pooled between all the different casinos that offer these games. The largest of these jackpots are usually Jackpot Pi√±atas and Aztec's Millions. Compared to similarly-sized multi-million dollar jackpots offered by competing game developers such as Microgaming or Playtech, these jackpots are rarely won and their slow rate of increase suggests that they are not particularly popular. In addition the non-progressive RTG \\"Real Series\\" slot machines may be configured with tiered random progressive jackpots that are local to a specific casino, or a group of casinos that are run by the same operator. These local jackpots can be won randomly and independently of the alignment of symbols on the game reels on any spin. Operators are able to configure the jackpots on a per-game basis or group several games together in order to contribute to a shared local jackpot. Slots manufacturers such as RTG began to produce cabinet-based video slots games with increasing numbers of special features like Feature Guarantee, Jackpot Pyramid, Boiling Point Jackpot, Suit ‚Äôem Up, Vegas Three Card Rummy. Additionally, the most popular games were migrated to Mobile versions, and such features like Instant Play and Download are also available for RTG-powered casinos . Perhaps the single biggest breakthrough of the latter half of the 20th century in slots came in the form of multiple payline slots.

The Parahyangan area is the heartland of Sundanese culture, the total surface area of this area is approximately a little less than 1/6 of Java. Parahyangan is bordered in the West by the province of Banten, in the North by the northern coast region of Subang, Cirebon and Indramayu (former residencies of Batavia and Cheribon), in the east by the province of Central Java (former residencies of Banyumas and Pekalongan), in the south by the Indian Ocean. Etymology The name \\"Parahyangan\\" is originated from Sundanese words which means \\"the abode of hyangs (gods)\\". Parahyangan is a mountainous region, and ancient Indonesians believed that the gods resided in the mountain tops. The \\"hyang\\" derivation in other placenames on the island of Java, as in the Dieng Plateau in the centre, or the Hyang Plateau in the east. A Sundanese legend of Sangkuriang contain the memory of the prehistoric ancient lake in Bandung basin highland, which suggest that Sundanese already inhabit the region since stone age era. Another popular Sundanese proverb and legend mentioned about the creation of Parahyangan highlands, the heartland of Sundanese realm; \\"When the hyangs (gods) were smiling, the land of Parahyangan was created\\".

The temple is estimated to be dated from early 7th century CE, around the same period ‚Äî or even earlier, than Dieng temples of Central Java. The oldest written historical reference to the Priangan region dates back to circa 14th century was found in Cikapundung inscription, where the region was one of the settlement within the Kingdom of Pajajaran. Parahyangan is a part of the former Sunda Kingdom. The inland mountainous region of Parahyangan was considered as sacred place in Sunda Wiwitan beliefs. The kabuyutan or mandala (sacred sanctuary) of Jayagiri was mentioned in ancient Sundanese texts and located somewhere in Parahyangan highlands, probably north of modern-day Bandung in the slopes of Mount Tangkuban Perahu. After the fall of Sunda Kingdom in the 16th century, Priangan was administrated by the nobles and aristocrats of Cianjur, Sumedang and Ciamis. Those princes claimed as the rightful heir and descendants of Sunda kings lineage, King Siliwangi. Although the dominant power at that time was held by Banten and Cirebon Sultanates, the Sundanese aristocrats of Parahyangan highland enjoyed relatively internal freedom and autonomy. In 1617, Sultan Agung of Mataram launched a military campaign throughout Java and vassalized Sultanate of Cirebon. In 1618 Mataram troops conquered Ciamis and Sumedang and ruled most of Parahyangan region. Mataram Sultanate was involved in a power contest with Dutch East India Company (VOC) centered in Batavia. Later Mataram was gradually weakened through a struggle of successions of Javanese princes and Dutch involvements in internal Mataram court affair. To secure their positions, later Mataram kings have made significant concessions with VOC and have given up many of its lands that originally acquired by Sultan Agung, that including Priangan. Since early 18th century Priangan was under Dutch rule. During the Dutch colonial time, this area was known as De Preanger. The capital of Preanger initially located in Tjiandjoer (Cianjur), and later moved to Bandung that gradually developed into an important settlement. By 19th century Colonial Dutch has established its holds over most of Java. And through the construction of Daendels' Java Great Post Road that connected Preanger plantation area with the port of Batavia and many other parts of Java, the Preanger was open for investment, exploitations and business. Preanger was an important and productive plantation area during Dutch East Indies era that produce coffee, tea, quinine and many cash crops that benefited many of wealthy Dutch plantation owners. The Java coffee, promoted worldwide by the Dutch, was actually the coffee grown in Parahyangan area. In the early 20th century, Bandung grew into an important settlement and planned city. The pre-war Bandung was designed as the new capital of Dutch East Indies, however the World War II brought this plan to end. After Indonesian independence, Parahyangan is considered as the romantic historical name for the mountainous region of West Java surrounding Bandung.

It was the site of two Dnepr radar (NATO \\"Hen House\\") radar installations constructed in the 1960s. A Daryal radar was being built there before the collapse of the Soviet Union. Skrunda was strategically important to the Soviet Union as its radars covered Western Europe. The two barn-like radars were one of the most important Soviet early warning radar stations for listening to objects in space and for tracking possible incoming ICBMs.  Military installation  Pursuant to an agreement On the Legal Status of the Skrunda Radar Station During its temporary Operation and Dismantling, signed by Latvia and the Russian Federation on 30 April 1994, the Russian Federation had been allowed to run the radar station for four years, after which it was obliged to dismantle the station within eighteen months. The deadline for dismantling was 29 February 2000. Russia asked Latvia to extend the lease on the Dnepr station at Skrunda for at least two years, until the new Volga station under construction near Baranovichi in Belarus became operational. Riga rejected these requests, and the radar was verified closed on 4 September 1998 by an inspection team from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. On 4 May 1995 American demolition experts blew up a 19-storey tower in Skrunda-1. It housed a former Soviet Daryal radar system, one of the most advanced bistatic early-warning radars in the world. It served as one of the USSR's most important radar stations as it was responsible for scanning skies to the west for incoming bombers or nuclear missiles before the USSR disintegrated. The event spilled tens of thousands of Latvian people onto country roads and fields to watch the early morning spectacle, which was also televised nationwide. Latvian leaders, diplomats and other officials toasted the blast with champagne. The demolition was sponsored by the United States, the Soviet Union's main nuclear rival, as they paid 7 million US dollars for the destruction, while the US-based firm Controlled Demolition, Inc. was hired for the destruction job. In a joint New Year 1998 statement, the presidents of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania urged Russian President Boris Yeltsin to complete the pullout of all Russian troops from the region, as Russia had promised four years prior in 1994. All materials of value were removed from the site and carried back to Russia when the last Russian troops left in 1998; the 60 buildings that comprised the former complex and town, including apartment blocks, a school, barracks and an officers club, remained. The dilapidated buildings were still standing in 2010. The Latvian government decided to sell the Skrunda-1 site in 2008, and on 5 February 2010, the entire former town was sold as a single lot at auction in Riga. The starting bid was 150,000 lats (290,000 USD; 211,000 EUR). The winning bid was by Russian firm Alekseevskoye-Serviss for 1.55 million lats (3.1 million USD; 2.2 million EUR). The auction, which lasted two hours, was also contested by another Russian firm, as well as a bidder from Azerbaijan. The winning bidder pulled out of the auction, as did the runner up. The town was reauctioned in June 2010 for only 170,000 Lats. In 2015 the site was bought by Skrunda Municipality for ‚Ç¨12,000. Around half the area has been handed over to the Latvian National Armed Forces as a training ground. The remainder is to be leased by the local government with the stipulation that potential investors develop the area economically. Demolition of selected derelict buildings has since commenced. From February 2016 in response to increased interest at the site, the municipality began charging an entrance fee of 4 euros for individuals. As of 21 October 2018, Skrunda 1 is closed for visitors.

Nilakantha somayaji was an important astronomer-mathematician of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics and was the author of the much celebrated astronomical work titled Tantrasamgraha. This book stresses the necessity and importance of astronomical observations to obtain correct parameters for computations and to develop more and more accurate theories. It even discounts the role of revealed wisdom and divine intuitions in studying astronomical phenomena. Jyotirmimamsa is sometimes cited as proof to establish that modern methodologies of scientific investigations are not unknown to ancient and medieval Indians. The nature of the astronomical and mathematical work, the divine intuition, the experimental details of the science, corrections to the planetary parameters, reasons for the corrections for the planetary revolutions, Vedic authority for inference in astronomy, relative accuracy of different systems, and correction through eclipses, true motion, position, etc., of planets are some of the topics discussed in Jyotirmimamsa.

It is situated in the middle of the state of Nevada, running north and south in a columnar area, extending \\"northward from Nye County to the Tuscaroara Mountains, to north of the Humboldt River.\\" The county was formed to help the residents of the township of Eureka. Before the creation of Eureka County, the residents had to travel to Lander County for county government business. For the convenience of the residents of Eureka, the new county was formed, and was named after the town of Eureka.Rufus Wood Leigh, Nevada Place Names: Their Origin and Significance, (Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1964). This in turn aided the residents of Ruby Hill. Mining boomed in Ruby Hill around 1878, when the population grew to its maximum of 2,500 residents. The majority of the 900 residents were miners and their respective families. The town was a bustling center with many stores, schools, churches, a theater, a miner‚Äôs union, a brewery, and a printing shop. In the printing shop, the first copies of the Mining Report were produced. It was later renamed the Mining News. By 1880, the population of Ruby Hill had declined, and by 1885, 700 remained. They continued to mine until the end of the 19th century. Miners were able to lease land and prospect for ore. Some of them did find an untouched vein of ore. By the start of the 20th century, the population of the town was so small that only three businesses remained. In 1910 a powerful storm washed away the railroad and buildings, and many townspeople left. Of the buildings left standing, only one was built in the 19th century. Ruby Hill, NevadaThis small mining camp was active for many years and produced nearly $200,000. The initial location was the Cow and Calf Mine discovered in 1871. The Ruby Hill Mining District was organized in July 1872. By August, Ruby Hill reached its peak population of approximately 150. The town had two restaurants, two stores, a bar, and a boardinghouse. By fall, the smaller mines were depleted and only the four largest mines were producing. Legal problems forced the mines to close and emptied the once bustling camp. In the early 1880s some mines reopened. That was short lived, and by 1885 only two residents remained. There was intermittent activity until 1928, when all mining activity ended. Because the camp was active for only a few years at a time, few permanent buildings were constructed. Most of the mines are high in the mountains, and access is extremely difficult.

History In the second half of the 19th century - particularly since the 1870s - the popularization of evolutionary theories on the rise in Europe, led to large increase of scientific institutions in Latin America, and made the museum the preferential sites of exposure of these theories . Such theories have been adapted and took specific format in Brazil in order to legitimize some speculation about the position as they would be blacks and mestizos in the evolutionary chain suggested by Darwin. It was in this context that, in 1882, the National Museum, directed by Ladislau Netto, as a generator of research and academic issues, promoted the Brazilian Anthropological Exhibition. To bring the collection to be shown in the exhibition, Netto sent requests to all provinces molds Botocudo arrived from Goias and Esp√≠rito Santo came ethnological objects of Amazonas and Mato Grosso, lithic and ceramic pieces were sent by the Museum of Paran√°, and private collections. The books were borrowed from the National Library. According to the Show Guide, the collections were organized in eight halls, especially redecorated for the occasion, receiving the names of naturalists and missionaries of the past, such as Pero Vaz de Caminha, Jean de Lery, Gabriel Soares de Sousa, Jos√© de Anchieta, Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira, and contemporary scientists, such as Martius, Hartt and Lund. In each of these sections were displayed various archaeological objects to a greater or lesser number. The room Lund was the one that got fossilized human remains, while the Hartt contained most of the ceramic fragments and Lery the remains of middens. For reporting on the event to the general public, the exhibition was attended by journalists of the leading journals of the city, including the famous (and feared) cartoonist, Angelo Agostini, and photographer Marc Ferrez. As special attraction, were brought a small group of Indians Botocudos, from Esp√≠rito Santo, and three other Indians Xerente of Minas Gerais. Prestigious by the presence of the emperor himself, D. Pedro II and his daughter, Princess Isabel, the Exhibition was inaugurated on July 29, 1882, extending over three months. He had an audience of over a thousand visitors, a real success in the country, with international repercussions. References * Lopes, Maria Margaret (1997).

It is headquartered at Gowen Field, Boise, Idaho. It has been reorganized into an Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) but remains the only unit to be designated a \\"Cavalry Brigade Combat Team\\" by special appointment of the US Army. The 116th Cavalry Brigade Combat Team has units located throughout Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Nevada. It was reorganized into a heavy armor brigade in 1989. Often referred to as the Snake River Brigade and formerly known as the 116th Armored Cavalry Regiment, the unit includes about 3,000 citizen-soldiers from Idaho.

It organized between March ‚Äì November 1920 in the valley of the Snake River. It was redesignated on 12 October 1921 as the 116th Cavalry (less 2nd and 3rd Squadrons): Headquarters was federally recognized on 11 February 1922 at Boise (2nd and 3rd Squadrons were allotted in 1929 to the Idaho National Guard). The location of headquarters changed on 15 March 1929 to Weiser; and on 9 December 1930 back to Boise. The 116th Cavalry (less 3rd Squadron) converted and was redesignated on 16 September 1940 to the 183rd Field Artillery (the 3rd Squadron concurrently converted and was redesignated as elements of the 148th Field Artillery‚Äîhereafter separate lineage). The 183rd Field Artillery Battalion was inducted into federal service on 1 April 1941 at home stations. The regiment was broken up on 8 February 1943 and its elements were reorganized and redesignated as follows: Headquarters and Headquarters Battery as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 183 Field Artillery Group; the 1st Battalion as the 183rd Field Artillery Battalion (it inactivated on 30 October 1944, Camp Myles Standish, Massachusetts); the 2nd Battalion as the 951st Field Artillery Battalion (it inactivated on 13 October 1945 also at Camp Myles Standish. The above units were reorganized as elements of the 183rd Infantry (Headquarters was federally recognized on 10 January 1947 at Twin Falls) and the 116th Mechanized Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron (Headquarters was federally recognized on 8 January 1947 at Caldwell). The 183rd Infantry (less 3rd Battalion) and 116th Mechanized Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron were consolidated, reorganized, and redesignated on 12 September 1949 as the 116th Armored Cavalry with headquarters at Twin Falls. The 3rd Battalion, 183rd Infantry, was concurrently converted and redesignated as the 116th Engineer Combat Battalion‚Äîhereafter separate lineage. The 3rd Squadron was allotted on 15 December 1967 to the Nevada Army National Guard; it was relieved on 11 May 1974 from allotment to the Nevada Army National Guard and allotted to the Oregon Army National Guard. The 1st Squadron was relieved on 1 May 1977 from allotment to the Idaho Army National Guard. The Attack Helicopter Company was allotted on 1 September 1975 to the Washington and Wyoming Army National Guard. The unit reorganized and was redesignated on 1 September 1989 in the Idaho and Oregon Army National Guard as the 116th Cavalry, a parent regiment under the United States Army Regiment System, to consist of the 2nd and 3rd Battalions and Troop E, elements of the 116th Cavalry Brigade, and Troop F, and element of the 41st Infantry Brigade. The 116th Cavalry Brigade then joined the 4th Infantry Division as the roundout brigade. It was reorganized on 1 October 1995 to consist of the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, elements of the 116th Cavalry Brigade and in 1996 the brigade left the 4th Infantry Division.  Operation Joint Forge (SFOR XI)  Approximately 300 Idaho and Montana Army National Guardsmen and women of the 116th served in Bosnia in 2001 and 2002. The 116th Cavalry Brigade, headquartered at Gowen Field, deployed approximately 100 soldiers in March 2002, returning in October 2002. The 116th was under the command and control of the Army's 25th Infantry Division, Hawaii, during the deployment. The 91st Division (Training Support) trained the 116th Cavalry Brigade prior to its deployment to Bosnia for Stabilization Force 11.  Operation Iraqi Freedom III  In the early part of 2004 the 116th Cavalry Brigade was alerted for a mobilization to support Operation Iraqi Freedom. In June that year the entire brigade deployed for 18 months. The brigade spent the first six months at Fort Bliss, TX and Fort Polk, LA training for their combat mission. The majority of the brigade arrived in Iraq late 2004. The 116th Cavalry Brigade was assigned to the northern part of Iraq, primarily in and around the oil-rich city of Kirkuk with elements occupying FOB Warrior, FOB McHenry and Gains Mills. For nearly a full year the soldiers of the 116th Cavalry Brigade conducted full spectrum operations in and around Kirkuk, stabilizing the region for national elections, and training the Iraqi Army and police forces. The Iraq deployment marked the first time in the 116th Cavalry Brigade's history that the entire brigade had deployed together. This was also the first time that the 116th shoulder sleeve insignia was authorized to wear as the shoulder sleeve insignia ‚Äì Former Wartime Service (often referred to as a combat patch). As a cavalry unit, many soldiers serving in the brigade during the deployment were authorized to wear the gold combat spurs. In November 2005 the 116th Cavalry Brigade redeployed to the United States. After redeployment the 116th Cavalry was officially redesignated from 116th Cavalry Brigade to 116th Cavalry Brigade Combat Team.  Operation New Dawn  On 17 September 2010 the brigade began a 12-month deployment to Iraq, first traveling to Camp Shelby, Mississippi, for training and premobilization certification. After serving for a year in various locations in Iraq performing Force Protection missions, the brigade returned to Idaho in September 2011. During their deployment, they conducted numerous Force Protection missions. The unit was spread all over Iraq, being the main controlling task force for the country, from Late November 2010 to early September 2011, when they turned the country over to the Kentucky National Guard. From Quick Reaction Force platoons, convoy security teams, to ECP operations as well as administrative and biometrics operations, UAV operations, the 116th play a major role in initiating Operation New Dawn and the overall turnover of the country to the Iraqi Government.  Insignia  Shoulder Sleeve Insignia  Description: On a scarlet disc with a yellow border in diameter overall, a yellow sun emitting twelve rays surmounted by a blue horizontal wavy band bearing a yellow gliding snake. Symbolism: The wavy band and the snake are taken from the coat of arms of the former organization, the 116th Armored Cavalry Regiment. The wavy band and snake represent the Snake River, and refer to the home area of the former organization, the Snake River Valley. The sun alludes to the state of Idaho, noted for the beauty of its sunrises. The name is taken from Shoshoni Indian words meaning \\" the sun comes down the mountain\\" or \\"it is morning.\\" The predominant color, yellow, is representative of Armored Cavalry units. Background: The shoulder sleeve insignia was originally approved for the 116th Armored Cavalry Regiment on 9 October 1967. The insignia was redesignated and the symbolism revised on 1 September 1989.  Distinctive Unit Insignia  A gold color metal and enamel device high, consisting of a bundle of five gold arrows, points up, encompassed on either side of the tripartite black scroll passing across the center of the arrows and inscribed \\"MOVE STRIKE DESTROY\\" in gold letters; overall in base a red coiled rattlesnake. Symbolism: Yellow/gold is the color traditionally associated with Cavalry. The coiled rattlesnake epitomizes the unit's motto ‚Äì capabilities and military preparedness. The snake also alludes to the unit's association with the old 116th Armored Cavalry Regiment. The five arrows symbolize the unit's five campaign credits during World War II as Field Artillery; scarlet and yellow/gold are the colors associated with Field Artillery. Background: The distinctive unit insignia was authorized on 2 May 1989.

He is most commonly referred to as Donnell O'Donevane of Castledonovan in contemporary references of his time. His elder brother Diarmaid O'Donovan was slain by Donal Cam O'Sullivan Beare in 1581 following a raid urged by Elizabeth I into O'Sullivan territory.O'Sullivan Beare, Chapters, p. 26 Donal is credited with taking the leadership of Clan Cathail following the death of his father, and was inaugurated and granted the White Rod by the MacCarthy Reagh, his father-in-law Owen MacCarthy Reagh, Prince of Carbery, in 1584. He was then later recognized by the Lord Chancellor Adam Loftus in 1592, defeating an attempt by his younger brother Teige, who alleged Donal to be a bastard, to depose him. He was the last of his line so inaugurated in the ancient Gaelic manner. Following his adherence to Philip III of Spain during the Nine Years' War, in 1608 Donal surrendered his territory to James I of England, receiving a regrant of the entire estate to himself personally in 1615.D'Alton, pp. 709‚Äì10Burke 1899, p. 342 A series of inquisitions from 1599 to 1636 show his to have been the greatest land holdings during that period in Carbery after the territories of the MacCarthy princes,Butler, \\"The Barony of Carbery\\" although how this came about is a matter of some controversy. Inauguration and lawsuit Donal II's inauguration in 1584 by his father-in-law Owen MacCarthy Reagh is testified to in a complicated lawsuit filed essentially against the both of them by O'Donovan's younger brother Teige sometime previous to 12 February 1592. The suit was concurrent with the anticipated surrender of the sept lands by Donnel O‚ÄôDonovane (with similar surrender of other sept lands being undertaken by other chiefs, namely Conoghor O‚ÄôKallaghane, Conoghor O‚ÄôMahoney and Teig M‚ÄôOwen Carty) in exchange of a regrant of the lands into the personal estate property of the respective chief by patent.CALENDAR OP THE STATE PAPERS, RELATING TO I R E L A N D, OF THE REIGNS OF ELIZABETH, 1592, October 1596, June. PRESERVED IN THE PUBLIC RECORD OFFICE. EDITED BY HANS CLAUDE HAMILTON, ESQ., P.S.A., LONDON:PRINTED FOR HER MAJESTY'S STATIONERY OFFICE, BY EYRE AND SPOTTISWOODE, PRINTERS TO THE QUEEN'S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY, item 68, 1592 The surviving court document from that date contains a summary of the case and the decision of the Lord Chancellor Adam Loftus on the matter.O'Donovan, Hy-Fiachrach, pp. 444‚Äì8 In the suit Teige alleges that Donal was born before his father Donal I and mother Ellen O'Leary were married, and thus that he was in fact (according to Teige) illegitimate or a bastard and had no rights to the Lordship of Clancahill, with Teige even questioning whether Donal was a son of his father, Donal of the Hides, at all.O'Donovan, Hy-Fiachrach, p. 446 According to Teige, Donal owed his entire position to Owen MacCarthy Reagh, a man of great wealth and influence and to whose daughter Joane was joined in marriage, and who Teige alleges was not himself even the legitimate MacCarthy Reagh (Prince of Carbery) but an \\"intruder\\", the rightful ruler supposedly being Donal of the Pipes,O'Donovan, Hy-Fiachrach, p. 447 Owen's nephew. Loftus decided in Donal II O'Donovan and MacCarthy Reagh's favour, declaring them legitimate and rightful, with Teige getting nothing, however it is possible there were related events back in Carbery because Owen was deposed by his nephew later that year. MacCarthy Reagh was not popular in all circles, and influencing Loftus' decision was the testimony of another son-in-law, O'Donovan's brother- in-law Sir Fineen O'Driscoll, who was widely popular with the English and Crown government. O'Driscoll bore witness that O'Donovan \\"was born many years after the marriage [of his mother and father] solemnised at Dromale\\". Scholars of Gaelic Ireland frequently mention or refer to the case. First of all, it substantiates the report made a century later by Sir Richard Cox, 1st Baronet in 1690 that the O'Donovans were considered one of the four families in Carbery of royal extraction,Cox, Carberiae Notitia. With the MacCarthys obvious, the O'Mahonys and O'Driscolls were the others. See also Smith, Ancient and Present State because the White Rod or slat, mentioned in the case as received by O'Donovan from MacCarthy Reagh, was for a king or R√≠ of some grade in origin, in this case a subordinate lord princeps (prince) or petty king, in the Irish understanding, receiving his rod from his superior or overking.Dillon, pp. 4, 8; FitzPatrick, passim; Simms, p. 31; Nicholls, pp. 30‚Äì311 Also one of very last known uses of the slat in Irish history, as found in the lawsuit \\"its citation as formal evidence of legitimate holding of lordship and lands\\" is considered by Elizabeth FitzPatrick to be the strongest evidence of its symbolizing \\"legitimate authority\\" even at this late date in Gaelic Ireland.FitzPatrick, p. 214 Returning to the relationship between the MacCarthy Reagh and O'Donovan, it has been pointed out that the O'Donovan family in Carbery apparently had a privileged position because the head paid to his superior a significantly smaller rent than the other leading families enjoyed, possibly originating from the O'Donovans' close association with F√≠nghin Mac Carthaigh in the 13th century and their certain support given to him at the Battle of Callann in 1261.Butler, \\"The Barony of Carbery\\"; √ì Murchadha, p. 125 Donal II is the last of Clan Cathal, and the only one recorded as having received, the white rod. Curiously, in spite of Crown policy, which forbid the use of Gaelic titles, Loftus refers to Donel O'Donevane as simply O'Donovan (meaning the head of his sept and thus Lord of Clancahill, etc.), confirming it in the final paragraph of the document.O'Donovan, Hy-Fiachrach, p. 448 This recognized O'Donovan as Chief of the Name or Captain of his countrie.Ellis, p. 147 The designation of Donal as Chief by the English court of Loftus served the Crown's purposes: by formally \\"recognizing\\" Donal as \\"Chief\\", there could be no subsequent legal doubt he was authorized to surrender clan lands of approximately 60,000 acres to the English crown. Through the surrender and re-grant of clan lands, Donal obtained granted title to the lands vested in himself as an individual. Commenting on Donal and his contemporary descendants 250 years later, Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, noted that Donal and his heirs \\"held landlord possession of lands that belonged equally to their clansmen; England protected them in that landlord possession of the robbery from their own people.\\"Rossa's Recollections, O'Donovan Rossa 1898, republished 2004, Lyons Press, p.348 Career O'Donovan is first noted in 1586 for burning to the ground the newly built house of the Protestant Bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross, William Lyon.O'Donovan, Four Masters, vol. VI, p. 2441O'Hart, p. 200 Not only was the new house rather ostentatious, but Lyon was also accused of stealing and selling priceless gold and silver artifacts from the early period of the church. It is possible, however, that O'Donovan was guilty of burning the whole town of Ross or Rosscarbery itself, and his men appear to have killed one of Lyon's daughters in the attack.Vigors, p. 303 Although not among the major figures of his time, Donal II was in their company and active in Munster affairs during the Nine Years' War, being one of the few southern lords to support Hugh O'Neill.√ì Murchadha, p. 127; MacCarthy Glas, Life and Letters, p. 191 In March 1599 pledges of loyalty to the English Crown were received from all the lords in Carbery except for O'Donovan and some MacCarthys, and because of this Sir Thomas Norris \\"... caused their castles and houses to be taken and razed, and their people and lands to be spoiled\\", as he wrote to the Privy Council. But a year later O'Neill was both widely regarded and acting as virtual King of Ireland, or much of it, and was acknowledged by his supporters in Munster as such, including O'Donovan,A Compendium of Irish Biography: Hugh O'Neill wisely because those who refused had their lands wasted. In 1600 Donal joined Florence MacCarthy, whom O'Neill was acknowledging the MacCarthy M√≥r and King of Desmond,Irish Pedigrees: MacCarthy Mor #123 (O'Hart 1892) and Owen Mac Egan in O'Neill's camp at Inniscarra near Cork city, in writing an appeal to Donogh Moyle MacCarthy, one of Owen MacCarthy Reagh's sons and thus O'Donovan's brother-in-law, to join them.Carew, vol. ?, p. ? The letter was intercepted, and for his part and signature Donal's people were \\"pacified\\" savagely by the English forces under the command of Captain George Flower, who related: The plan was that O'Donovan and Florence's brother, Dermod Maol MacCarthy, would invade a number of territories to the north of Carbery, but it is uncertain if this was ever accomplished. In any event, not long after, when Philip III of Spain sent his forces to Munster, 100 men out of the 700 were assigned to Donal's command, fully equipped and paid for, to supplement his own forces.Stafford and Carew, Pacata Hibernia, vol. ?, p. ? According to Philip O'Sullivan Beare, he was one of the principal men of the relief army led by Donal Cam O'Sullivan Beare (slayer of his brother Diarmaid) to support Pedro de Zubiaur at Castlehaven in early December 1601, which led to what was according to O'Sullivan Beare a small but spectacular victory for the Spaniards and Irish:O'Sullivan Beare, Chapters, p. 143 Carbery in Tudor times However the English also claimed victory and moderns scholars are very divided on who should be considered the winners. Two months later, an apparently poorly informed or otherwise motivated Sir George Carew wrote to the English government on 15 February 1602:Calendar of State Papers, 1601‚Äì1603, p. 296Baltimore, the O\`Driscolls, and the end of Gaelic civilisation, 1538-1615 by Edward O'Mahony But this was only true in the sense that they were not all present at the final Battle of Kinsale itself in late December/early January, almost a month after Castlehaven, although O'Donovan may have made an appearance earlier at the siege.O'Mahony, West Cork and its Story, p. ? Changing allegiance after this ruinous event, O'Donovan joined Owen's sons Finghin and Donogh Maol, and O'Driscoll, in siding with the English, and O'Sullivan Beare wasted the territory of Clancahill after hearing of it.O'Sullivan Beare, Chapters, p. 152; Amory, p. 606 A surprising event occurred shortly after when some of O'Donovan's men, under the command of Finghin, killed Dermod Maol MacCarthy (cousin of O'Donovan) who was engaged in a cattle-raid into O'Donovan's territory.√ì Murchadha, pp. 55, 127 Dermod Maol was regarded as the chief threat after Florence to the English in Munster (now along with O'Sullivan Beare, who joined the cause late) He and O'Sullivan Beare had been joined in continuing against the English by Cornelius O'Driscoll, son of Sir Fineen who was now opposing them. After a period Finghin and Donogh Maol MacCarthy may have gone back to the rebel side but O'Donovan remained loyal to the English, even though his sept was divided in their allegiances. In July 1606, Donell M'Carthy, the M'Carthy Riough, petitioned the Earl of Salisbury that Donell O'Donevan, for whose loyalty petitioner's son was made surety and suffered four and a half years of imprisonment during the recent wars, should pay damages to him.'Cecil Papers: July 1606', Calendar of the Cecil Papers in Hatfield House, Volume 24: Addenda, 1605-1668. (1976), pp. 82-88. Prior to the fall of the Gaelic order, it was common that pledges were secured by the holding of the offspring of those making the pledge, or in this case, those guarantying the conduct of those under them. After the war O'Donovan fared particularly well and ended up in control of more territories than he began with, the result a combination of the government granting him lands seized from septs of the MacCarthys and others, and his own aggressive efforts.O'Donovan, Four Masters, Vol. VI, pp. 2441 ff; Butler, \\"The Barony of Carbery\\" In 1611, he was one of those accused by Florence MacCarthy of occupying some of his estates while he was being held in the Tower of London.MacCarthy Glas, Life and Letters, p. 396 Little of Donal II's later life to his death in 1639 remains known, besides what the inquisitions offer, but he was of considerable age by that period. Marriages and issue O'Donovan firstly married Helena de Barry, daughter of Shely MacCarthy(?) Probably Shely (Julia), daughter of (Sir) Finin MacCarthy (Reagh) and William de Barry, son of Ellen MacCarthy Reaghdaughter of Cormac na Haoine MacCarthy Reagh and James FitzRichard de Barry, Lord Ibane and Viscount Buttevant, and by her had 1) Donal III O'Donovan; 2) Conogher,O'Donovan of Brisbane and Queensland) entered the Austrian Army and never returned to Ireland; 3), 4) possibly two other sons. He married secondly Joanna MacCarthy Reagh, daughter of Ellen O'Callaghandaughter of Dermod O'Callaghan, Lord of Clonmeen and Owen MacCarthy Reagh, and by her had sons 1) Teige, for whom see below; 2) Capt. Murrough, royalist killed in command of a company of foot in the Battle of Rathmines; 3) Donough; 4) Dermot; 5) Capt. Richard, royalist, slain in foreign parts; 6) Keadagh. Of his three daughters 1) Honora became the second wife of Teige-an-Duna MacCarthy, Lord of Glean-na-Chroim; 2) m. MacCarthy of Mourne (junior sept of MacCarthy of Muskerry);Irish Pedigrees: MacCarthy na Mona 3;) m. O'Mahony Fionn (senior sept of O'Mahony, Prince of Raithlin). From his eldest son Donal III descended his male offspring through General Richard II O'Donovan (d. 1829), first to re-establish use of the designation \\"O'Donovan (Mor)\\" (based on regional public recognition of his right) since the fall of the Gaelic order around 1600. After the death of General O'Donovan, the title passed by agreement to the cadet line descending from 2) Teige above, who still hold it to this day. The first known male line descendant of Teige with a military career was Morgan William II O'Donovan. The famous scholar and topographer John O'Donovan claimed descent from Donal II's unnamed sons, first claiming his ancestor Edmund was the eldest son, and after some twenty years of research without being able to prove his claim, revised his claim to naming his ancestor Edmund as the youngest son of Donal II.O'Donovan, Annals of the Four Masters, vol. VI, p. 2154 etc Harper Belonging to Donal's household was the blind harper Conchubhar Mac Conghalaigh, for whom the lament Torchoir ce√≥l Cloinne Cathoil was composed by the bardic poet Tadhg Olltach √ì an Ch√°inte.Ua S√∫illeabh√°in and Donnelly Both Donal and the Lady Joanna are mentioned in the poem, where her grief for the harper is described (12th stanza): Also mentioned is D√°ire Cerbba, 4th century progenitor of the U√≠ Fidgenti and more famous U√≠ Liath√°in. The O'Donovans belong to the former.

A catalog based on the short, titled Logobook and written by the film's co-director Ludovic Houplain, was published by Taschen in 2013. Plot The short opens with a panorama of Los Angeles where all of its buildings and inhabitants are in some form of commercial branding: Birds are in the form of Bentley and Aston Martin logos and MSN's butterfly; pedestrians are in the shape of the AIM icon; and overhead highway signs are mounted on Atlantic Records logos, among others. The Original Pringles mascot (voiced by David Fincher) pulls into a Pizza Hut restaurant's parking lot and propositions an Esso Girl waitress (voiced by Aja Evans) on a smoking break (her cigarette is the Air France logo). Meanwhile, BiC Boy students alongside Bob's Big Boy (voiced by Joel Michaely) and Haribo Boy (voiced by Matt Winston) are on a tour at a zoo led by a flamboyant Mr. Clean (voiced by Michaely); hating the tour, Big Boy and Haribo Boy hop off the tour train and soon begin to harass the MGM lion by mooning and throwing a bottle of Coca- Cola at it, prompting the zoo's owner, the Jolly Green Giant (voiced by Michaely), to scold them. As Michelin Man police officers Mitch and Mike (voiced by Bob Stephenson and Sherman Augustus) order lunch at KFC, a call comes in over the radio stating that a criminal named Ronald McDonald (voiced by Stephenson) is on the loose on a red delivery truck; both Mitch and Mike spot Ronald in his truck and chase him. The police pursuit quickly veers out of control, as many innocent bystanders are imperiled/injured. Meanwhile, the BiC students alongside Big Boy and Haribo Boy at the zoo have finished their tour and are back on the school bus, soon nearing the Pizza Hut where Esso Girl is serving the Original Pringles mascot and the Pringles Hot & Spicy mascot. Ronald swerves to avoid the school bus and crashes his truck over in front of the Pizza Hut. Several guns and biological weapons then spill out of the back of the truck, tempting Big Boy and Haribo Boy to steal and sell them at the black market. Ronald gets out of the truck and knocks out Haribo Boy with his foot, before taking Big Boy hostage and running inside the Pizza Hut. Big Boy frees himself by biting Ronald in the arm, before running for cover behind the counter with Esso Girl while an enraged Ronald attempts to shoot him. The police are given the excuse to start firing on Ronald, but Ronald kills one of the police officers. As the gunfight ensues in the streets, a low rumbling is heard across Los Angeles, resulting in a giant earthquake erupting and opening a fissure shaped like Microsoft's Xbox logo that splits the streets wide open. Big Boy and Esso Girl escape the rapidly collapsing Pizza Hut using a hijacked police car while the Original Pringles mascot and the Pringles Hot & Spicy mascot are both crushed inside. After shooting Mitch with his gun (as shown via the gun barrel sequence √† la James Bond), Ronald rides through the city on a stolen Grease 2 motorcycle, but drives into a fallen Weight Watchers sign and is thrown off, sliding and falling into a crevasse shaped like the Zenith Electronics logo. As he pulls himself back up, he is run over by Esso Girl and Big Boy, who barely escape the city and speed along a curved highway shaped like the VAIO logo. As the duo near the Hollywood Chewing Gum Hollywood Sign, it falls apart and sends the giant letters crashing onto the highway in front of them. While evading one of the letters, the duo veer off the highway and down a hill, finally crashing into a tree shaped like the American Century Investments logo. Following this, petroleum oil suddenly erupts from the rifts around town and entirely floods Los Angeles. The hill Esso Girl and Big Boy are stranded on splits into two, revealing a giant North Face logo while the land crumbles around them, swallowed by the sea and leaving the duo on a tiny island together. The film closes with Esso Girl picking up and biting a colored Apple Inc. logo while lying down on the island alongside Big Boy, before zooming out to reveal that California has been separated from mainland and is now shaped like the Nike, Inc. logo, but also revealing that the entire universe is made up of even more logos.

H5 members explained that, \\"Logorama presents us with an over- marketed world built only from logos and real trademarks that are destroyed by a series of natural disasters (including an earthquake and a tidal wave of oil). Logotypes are used to describe an alarming universe (similar to the one that we are living in) with all the graphic signs that accompany us in our lives. This over-organized universe is violently transformed by the cataclysm becoming fantastic and absurd. It shows the victory of the creative against the rational, where nature and human fantasy triumph.\\" Brands, mascots and logos The entirety of Logorama is made up of brand images, logos and mascots, with these brand images, logos and mascots used as characters, props, locations, vehicles and other content. Notable uses within the film include McDonald's mascot Ronald McDonald being depicted as the main antagonist, while Michelin Men are depicted as the police. However, some of the logos are also derived from fictional works, such as Slurm from Futurama, the Ghostbusters logo, the Buy-N-Large (BnL) sign from WALL-E and the South Park sign.

The property was listed on the National Register on February 17, 1983. History The property was purchased by Adam Broom in the late nineteenth century for commercial purposes. He built a large building in 1890 in the Italianate style and operated his grocery at the site until the turn of the century. The building was then purchased by William Harper, another grocer, who ran his store at the location from 1901 until 1917. The building was also used for the Practical Business College.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 552. Appearance The three-story brick building is rectangular in shape to fit its lot. The corner of the building is rounded off and contains the main entrance. Another entrance is located to the right of the main entrance with a large picture window in between. Small rectangular windows line the west facade and illuminate the interior ground floor. Stone surrounds the entrances and windows and breaks up the monotony of the brick face. The second floor contains long rectangular windows which are set within rusticated stone blocks. Brick pilasters line the walls along the rounded corner and are set with windows in between. All windows on this floor are 1/1 sash. The third floor is lined with the same 1/1 sash windows as the floor below, but are surmounted by a brick arch with a decorative keystone of rusticated stone. A stone belt course also lines the third floor at the top of the windows and runs the entire length of the building. A stone block is located on the rounded corner and bears the word \\"Broom\\" in large block letters. The flat roof sets on a metal cornice with a panelled frieze and egg and dart moulding. The overhang is supported by consoles and foliated ornament. Large red brick chimneys rise from the roof. Historic site In early 1983, the Broom Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture. Critical to its designation was its status as one of Cambridge's few remaining Italianate buildings without major modifications: numerous Italianate buildings once lined Wheeling Avenue downtown, but few have survived to the present.

The Old Guard had its roots as the \\"Regulars\\" in the inner party factional war of 1919, which resulted in the fragmentation of the Socialist Party into the Communist Party of America and Communist Labor Party of America. In 1935, the personal and political friction between the Old Guard and the Militants (and their \\"Progressive\\" allies) led to an organizational split, with the Old Guard faction leaving to establish the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). History Formation of the Old Guard faction The Old Guard and their Militant foes both hailed from the broad Marxist tradition, the former seeing democracy as a positive value in itself and emphasizing the efficacy of the electoral road to power while the latter tended to see democracy as a sort of chimera, a tactical expedient propagated by the bourgeois in its maintenance of class power. Beyond this important analytical difference, the divide between these two factional groupings was largely generational, with the Old Guard dominated by middle aged party veterans of large standing while newcomers into the Socialist Party during the Depression years of the early 1930s tended to gravitate as a younger and more aggressive caucus. Historian Irving Howe, himself a young Militant in the SP in the early 1930s, later recalled his own perception of the \\"Old Guard\\": > On the right stood the Old Guard, hard and unyielding. As a youthful > newcomer to the socialist movement, I was of course contemptuous of the Old > Guard, and so was almost every other new member. ... In the American left of > those days anything not 'revolutionary' was dismissed as beneath discussion; > but that didn't bother the Old Guard, which gloried in its distance from the > vulgar ferment of popular radicalism. Perhaps the Old Guard carried within > itself too large a weight of historical pain ‚Äî its admirers would say, > historical knowledge. It had won the struggle against the communists in the > garment unions during the 1920s, but that had drained much of its socialist > spirit. It made of its very moderation a mannerism of excess. With a > principled sort of grouchiness, it seemed almost intent upon showing that > sectarianism can be found anywhere along the socialist spectrum.Irving Howe, > Socialism and America. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985; pp. 54-55. Split of the Old Guard In March 1935 the combined Progressives and Militants of the Socialist Party launched a new weekly newspaper in New York City to supplant the Old Guard-dominated The New Leader ‚Äî The Socialist Call. The Managing Editor of the new 12-page publication was Bruno Fischer, with Miliitant stalwart Jack Altman acting as Business Manager. The paper took direct aim at the Old Guard from the outset in declaring itself to be \\"the organ of revolutionary socialism\\": SPA National Chairman Leo Krzycki sent the new publication his warm greetings at the time of its launch, although beseeching it to \\"steer clear of party controversy.\\"\\"The Socialist Call Needed to Fight 'Radio Misleaders,' Chairman Krzycki Writes,\\" The Socialist Call, vol. 1, no. 1 (March 23, 1935), pg. 4.

It was held at Gotham Hall in New York City. Thirteen teams representing their countries competed for a total of $130,000 USD in prize money. Format All of the competitors participating in the competition Teams consist of two members. One member competes using a QWERTY keyboard, while the other member uses a numeric keypad. Thirteen countries participated in the 2010 competition: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, New Zealand, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, and the United States. Previously, LG hosted texting competitions in individual countries such as the United States and South Korea. The United States had competitions for 2007, 2008, and 2009. South Korea had competitions in 2008 and 2009. However, 2010 was the first year when countries competed against each other. Qualification Teams earned the right to participate in regional qualifiers. Over six million people registered to compete in the tournament. Each team participated in five separate events: \\"break the wall\\", \\"monster popping\\", \\"moving pillar\\", \\"running relay\\", and \\"racing replay\\". The basic premise was to copy a scrolling piece of text as quickly as possible. No errors were allowed in transcription. All of the text messages were in the native language of the participants, but had the same number of characters in order to ensure fairness. Additionally, all participants had to use the LG enV3, LG BL20 or LG GW520 Results Ha Mok-Min and Bae Yeong-Ho Ha Mok-min, aged 16, and her partner, 17-year-old Bae Yeong-ho, won first prize in the competition. Mok-min won the national championship, and was able to text at an average of 7.25 characters per second. She signed up for the competition when she noticed a kiosk in the mall, and saw the opportunity to win free movie tickets. Yeong- ho, a high school dropout, signed up in order to obtain money to buy a new car. The second-place finishers were Kate Moore and Morgan Dynda from the United States. The third place team was from Argentina. The prizes were set at US$100,000 per pair for first place, $20,000 per pair for second place and $10,000 per pair for third place. Records A side competition was offered to see who could beat the Guinness Book of World Records record for fastest text message sent. This record was broken by Pedro Matias from Portugal. He typed a 264-character text message in 1:59. The records for fastest keystrokes per minute on a numeric keyboard was set by Indonesia at 306, while the most keystrokes per minute record on a QWERTY keyboard was set by South Korea at 357.

He was the coordinator of intelligence services and a senior presidential adviser to President of Uganda Yoweri Museveni. He served as army commander and also a member of High Command UPDF, the UPDF defense council and a member of parliament representing the Uganda People's Defence Force. He had a falling out with Museveni and formed the Freedom and Unity Front in exile in the United Kingdom following being charged for plotting a coup where he has been allegedly planning anti-government activities by the Museveni government. Early and personal life Tinyefuza attended Nyakasura High School. He holds the degree of Bachelor of Laws Honours (LLB) and Master of Laws (LLM) from Makerere University. He also attended the Law Development Centre for the Diploma in Legal Practice where he left after a clerkship for cadet training in Tanzania. He was also a student leader at Makerere University. He has obtained the senior command qualifications of PSC from the Uganda Senior Command and Staff College at Kimaka, Jinja, Uganda. He also holds a Certificate in Information Technology from an institution in Canada. He also attended the Police Cadet Course in Tanzania and Senior Command Strategic Course. He is married to Juliet Tinyefuza. Name change On 17 February 2012, David Tinyefuza officially changed his name to David Sejusa. He said that Sejusa is a family name that is also reflected on some of his academic documents but that he had abandoned it \\"around secondary school level\\" but that he would re-claim as \\"everybody back home\\" refers to him as such. He added: \\"There is nothing in reverting to my original name. It is comrades like you who didn‚Äôt know it was my name but those elder comrades have always referred to me as such. And I suggest that from today you quote me as Gen. David Sejusa.\\" The Sejusa name is a Luganda rendering that is loosely translated as \\"I have no regrets;\\" it also has the same meaning in the Ankole rendition of Tinyefuza, which he said was a reason to take a new identity. Military career Prior to 1981, David Tinyefuza was a policeman with the Uganda Police Force serving as Assistant Superintendent of Police. In 1981, he became a combatant in the Uganda Bush War between the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA) of Milton Obote and the National Resistance Army (NRA) of Yoweri Museveni, from 1981 until 1986. For a period of 10 years following the victory of the NRA in 1986, he served as a member of the National Resistance Army Council (NRAC) and the National Executive Committee (NEC). Between 1989 and 1992, he served as Minister of State for Defense. In 1993, he was appointed Presidential Adviser on Peace and Security, serving in that capacity until 1997. He was appointed Senior Presidential Adviser and Coordinator of Intelligence in 2005, a position he held until 2013. Politics The party was founded in November 2013 with an official announcement later made in London, United Kingdom, where former General David Sejusa was in exile. Sejusa said of President Yoweri Museveni: \\"He's had enough time. He can leave and go, and we start a new process of national healing. And we are organising ourselves, we are establishing a constitutional rule which he destroyed.\\" Sejusa denied seeking the presidency and said that it was \\"a waste of time\\" to run against Museveni within the structures of the current system. Two months earlier, Museveni challenged Sejusa to try to overthrow him, but added that whoever uses violence would be stopped. \\"If Sejusa wants to use force, let him come.\\" In turn, Sejusa responded to questions of whether he would use force to bring change and said: \\"It's not so much that we want to do so. But if he continues to unleash terror on the population ours will be self defence.\\" Following a rift with the establishment in May 2013 about Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni's son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, over allegation of nepotism and that he would eventually simply replace his father as president, a motion Kainerugaba denied, he founded the Freedom and Unity Front. Sejusa had earlier called on Ugandans to \\"build alternative capacity\\" and remove Museveni. He added, the week following his departure as an MP representing the military, that \\"no one should imagine that Museveni will be removed through elections.\\" References Category:Ugandan lawyers Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Ugandan generals Category:Members of the Parliament of Uganda Category:Ugandan military personnel Category:Makerere University alumni Category:Uganda Senior Command and Staff College alumni Category:Government ministers of Uganda ","title":"David Sejusa"},{"id":"26114295","text":"Sing Along with Acid House Kings is the fourth studio album by Swedish indie pop band Acid House Kings.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it served as the main capital of the Majeerteen Sultanate. Etymology Alula is derived from the Somali term \\"lul\\", which means pearl. Overview Alula is located about west of Cape Guardafui, at the extremity of the Horn of Africa. 20 nautical miles (23 miles) east of Alula lies the coastal town of Bereeda. 7 nautical miles (8 miles) west lies Ras Filuk, the likely Cape Elephant (Elephas) of Strabo and the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. Adjacent to Alula is a shallow lagoon surrounded by mangrove bushes, which appears to correspond with the \\"large laurel-grove called Acannae\\" also described by the Periplus. An area in Aluula circa 1925-1927. On the coastal plain 20 km to Alula's east are ruins of an ancient monument in a platform style. The structure is formed by a rectangular drystone wall that is low in height; the space in between is filled with rubble and manually covered with small stones. Relatively large standing stones (menhirs) are also positioned on the edifice's corners. Near the platform are graves, which are outlined in stones. 24 m by 17 m in dimension, the structure is the largest of a string of ancient platform and enclosed platform monuments exclusive to far northeastern Somalia. During the mid-1800s to early 1900s, Alula served as the main capital of the Majeerteen Sultanate (Migiurtinia). A castle built in the city for the kingdom's Boqor (King) Osman Mahamuud is one of a number of local remains from this era. In the post- independence period, Alula became the principal town in the Alula District, situated in the autonomous Puntland state. On April 8, 2013, the Puntland government announced the creation of a new region coextensive with Cape Guardafui named Gardafu. Carved out of Bari, it consists of three districts and has its capital at Alula. The new region was officially approved by legislators on July 20, 2013, during the 30th session of the Puntland parliament. Education Alula has a number of academic institutions. According to the Puntland Ministry of Education, there are 11 primary schools in the Alula District. Among these are Xabo, Geesaley, Murcanyo, Xoogad and Alula Primary. Transportation Air transportation in Alula is served by the Alula Airport. According to the Somali government, the town has a small seaport. Climate Alula has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BWh).

Vegetarianism in the Romantic Era refers to the rise of vegetarianism associated with the Romanticism movement in Western Europe from the eighteenth to the nineteenth century. Many of the late Romantics argued in favor of a more natural diet which excluded animal flesh for a plethora of reasons including the state of human and animal health, religious beliefs, economy and class division, animal rights, literary influence, as well as from new ideas about anthropology, consumerism, and evolution. The modern vegetarian and vegan movements borrow some of the same principles from the late Romantics to promote the adoption of diets free from animal products. England, Germany, and France were most affected by the turn to a predominantly meatless diet during this time. Vegetarianism in this period may also have been influenced by views on humanism developed during the Age of Enlightenment in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Romantic literary personalities who gave impetus to the shift to vegetarianism included Percy Shelley in his A Vindication of Natural Diet, Mary Shelley, Alexander Pope, Thomas Tryon, Lord Byron and Joseph Ritson. Romantic Support for Vegetarianism History Thomas Tryon. Though the establishment of the Vegetarian Society begins in 1847, vegetarianism as a practice dates back long before the formation of this organization. Until the creation of the Vegetarian Society, vegetarians were referred to as Pythagoreans.Spencer, Colin However, The Heretic's Feast: A History of Vegetarianism; Great Britain: Hartnolls Ltd, Bodmin. 1993 Romantic writers like Percy and Mary Shelley, Alexander Pope, Thomas Tryon and Joseph Ritson were promoters of vegetarianism. In her Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, Mary Shelley depicts The Creature of Dr. Frankenstein as a vegetarian. In an emotional speech the Creature tells how he will live in his self-imposed exile in South America. > My food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid, to glut > my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My > companion will be of the same nature as myself, and will be content with the > same fare. We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us > as on man, and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful > and human.Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, Frankenstein or, The Modern > Prometheus The 1818 Text, ed. James Rieger (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, > 1974, Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1982), p. 142. Essays and other literary works written by these influential Romantics supported a meatless diet. With ideologies rooted in Romantic aesthetics of compassion and communion with nature, these writers found the consumption of meat sacrilegious and inhumane. With the industrial revolution came a rebellion against the mass market economically centered consumerism that flourished during this period. Romantics favored a more primal communion with nature that had nothing to do with currency or economics. Increased prices on meat products, a result of profit-driven markets, and the growth of humanitarian feelings towards both human and animal rights led to a rise in vegetarianism. During the eighteenth century, with more varieties of vegetables available, practicing a meatless diet became much easier to maintain. Nearly every large town in Western Europe now had numerous gardens fully supplied with fruits and vegetables.'The Heretic's Feast: A History of Vegetarianism; Great Britain: Hartnolls Ltd, Bodmin. 1993, pp 239‚Äì243 Between the new accessibility of meat alternatives, Romantic ideals of nature and humanism, and the desire to rebel against consumerism and class distinctions, the vegetarian movement had begun. Enlightenment and Humanism The vegetarian movement has a beginning during The Enlightenment when a shift in European attitudes towards justice, liberty, freedom, and brotherhood appears.Spencer, Colin, The Heretic's Feast: A History of Vegetarianism; Great Britain: Hartnolls Ltd, Bodmin. 1993, pp 223‚Äì24 The adoption of these new attitudes not only were applied to humans but were extended to all of god's creatures. John Locke thought that observation of animals showed that animals too could communicate, feel pain, and perhaps express emotion. Humanitarianism was extended to the animal kingdom because it was felt that there was little difference separating humans from the creatures. Moved by Locke's arguments people started to think that animals and humans were in some way interconnected. Being unkind toward animals man would most likely be unkind towards his fellow man.Spencer, Colin, The Heretic's Feast: A History of Vegetarianism; Great Britain: Hartnolls Ltd, Bodmin. 1993, pp 225 With such principles in mind, vegetarianism became the proper response, one fueled by both humanitarianism and compassion. Economics and Consumerism Timothy Morton noted that, \\"by the Romantic period 'the consumer' had been born as an economic subject,\\" classifying humans as commodifiable entities for market and economic profit.Morton, Timothy, Cultures of Taste/Theories of Appetite: Eating Romanticism; New York: Palgrave Macmillan. 2004, pp 1 The shift to a meatless diet was seen by many as a way to distinguish oneself from an increasingly consumerist society fueled by industrialized living and profit- driven market conglomerates. An all-plant diet regime allowed those opposed to the present economic practices to exercise protest against consumerism by refusing the purchase of meat products. Romantic vegetarianism was a product of resistance to the \\"culture of luxury\\" which wove its way into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. With literary reformists like Shelley carrying the flag, the public turned to vegetarianism.Morton, Timothy, Cultures of Taste/Theories of Appetite: Eating Romanticism; New York: Palgrave Macmillan. 2004, pp 4‚Äì6 Meat had become a symbol of consumerism, so the Romantics, in an attempt to alleviate the oppressive nature of man and politics, boycotted such consumption. Meat had also become a symbol of class separation, with wealthy class consumers demanding red meat, and lower-class families eating potatoes and vegetables. In order to oppose such social separations, a number of individuals from various classes sought to remove meat consumption, therefore removing such class distinctions in the process. Essentially, vegetarianism became a radical response to a consumer-based pseudo-culture driven primarily by commercialization and market profit. The vegetarian movement established a Romantic form of consumerism that rejected raising meat prices in a newly market-driven mass society. Class The ills of society according to the Romantics had much to do with defining people according to class, both by terms of race and gender as well as economic status. The Romantics were largely concerned with hierarchical oppression within economic classes and on a greater scale were concerned with how humankind fit into the natural world. Eating meat was considered a vice of the wealthy as they were the only class in society at the time who could afford it regularly.Perkins, David. Romanticism and Animal Rights. Cambridge, UK; New York: Cambridge University Press. 2003. Poor society lived on more simple diet consisting of \\"bread, milk, porridge, potatoes and vegetables\\". The inability to buy the newest luxury, meat, led to many grievances between the classes. Often constrained by their finances, \\"vegetarians were to be found almost exclusively among the middle class intellectuals\\". Consuming meat became a symbol of wasteful decadence and greed, and a means to \\"gratify a guilty sensuality\\" as Thomas Day states in the History of Sanford and Merton. As the vegetarian Thomas Tryon espouses, \\"The eating of flesh and killing of creatures for that purpose, was never begun, nor is now continue'd for want of necessity, or for the maintenance of health, but chiefly because the high, lofty, spirit of wrath and sensuality had gotten the dominion of man, over the meek love, and innocent harmless nature, and being so rampant, could not be satisfy'd except it had a proportionable food\\". Consuming meat was a symbol of booming consumerism in the 18th century. The idea emerged that by adopting a simple vegetarian diet that was accessible to all would increase food supply, decrease the demand for land and inevitably, class conflict would decrease. According to Morton, \\"food is the material embodiment of all kinds of social practices\\" and as such, the vegetarians of the Romantic Period took to another form of consumerism: the boycott of meat. It was thought therefore that the link between the oppressive nature of man and an \\"unkind and brutal\\" diet would diminish and man would take to his natural state of being within nature. Evolution and Nature The eighteenth century brought with it new ideas of evolution and nature. Society now saw the environment and the organisms within it as more physically, biologically, and even emotionally complex. Biologists began to study the embryonic development and differences in individual organisms. With these new studies came new insight on the relationship between human and animal. French naturalist, Georges-Louis Leclerc Comte de Buffon addressed ideas of common ancestry in his Histoire naturelle stating that many scientists believed ‚Äúthat man and ape have a common origin; that, in fact, all the families among plants as well as animals, have come from common stock‚Äù.Buffon, Georges-Louis Leclerc Comte de, Histoire naturelle; Vol. 4, pp. 382 Theories of Charles Darwin, who claimed that all species were descended of common ancestors, also became prevalent in the early and mid-nineteenth century. These new scientific ideas stirred a great response from Romantic writers and members of European society who now began to see animals and man as interconnected. Anthropology and Physiognomy In his Moral Essay upon Abstinence (1802), Joseph Ritson claimed \\"how unnatural flesh-eating is to human physiognomy and how such a diet of blood will engender ferocity in those who consume it\\".Spencer, Colin, The Heretic's Feast: A History of Vegetarianism; Great Britain: Hartnolls Ltd, Bodmin. 1993, pp 233 He and other Romantics saw the eating of animals as a violation of nature. Such views on anthropology and physiognomy contributed to the vegetarian movement in Western Europe because of societal desires to both connect with nature, as well as to remain somewhat connected to the past. Much of Romantic literature displayed themes centered on the evocation of the past. Early Romantics, facing a new, modern, shiny, machine-driven world hoped to maintain older values of religion, nature, and imagination by establishing and maintaining attachments to earlier history. A way to maintain this connection with earlier, less mechanic human beings was revert to previous diet practices, and it was thought that the more primitive humans had sustained themselves on a diet closer to a vegetarian lifestyle. Romantic writers including Ritson, Shelley, and Pope perceived the movement to vegetarianism as a way of returning to nature, reclaiming history, and turning away from animal or carnal savagery. Shelley promoted this idealist principle in A Vindication of Natural Diet, writing, \\"It is a man of violent passions, blood-shot eyes, and swollen veins, that alone can grasp the knife of murder...In no cases has a return to vegetable diet produced the slightest injury: in most it has been attended with changes undeniably beneficial\\".Shelley, Percy Bysshe, \\"A Vindication of Natural Diet;\\" London: Smith & Davy. 1813, pp 15‚Äì16 Fueled by literary Romantics like Ritson and Shelley, vegetarianism became a substitute for what had been deemed to be a savage, physiologically conflicted practice of blood consumption. Health In 1699 Edward Tyson documented the overwhelming similarities between humans and animals, particularly apes and monkeys, but it was during the Romantic Era that advances in anthropology and physiognomy began to shape societal views on where humans fit into the world.Ritvo, Harriet. ‚ÄúBorder Trouble: Shifting the Line between People and Other Animals.‚Äù Social Research. Vol. 62. pp. 67-86. 1995. Knowledge about the similarities between human and animal anatomy gave rise to the belief that because non- human animal bodies are alike human bodies in regards to physical senses and emotional responses, consuming animals was morally wrong. Furthermore, it was believed to be beneficial for humans to return to a diet based on plant matter. As Joseph Ritson reasoned, \\"the teeth and intestines of man being like those of frugivorous animals, he should, naturally, be range'd in this class\\".Morton, Timothy. ‚ÄúJoseph Ritson, Percy Shelley and the Making of Romantic Vegetarianism.‚Äù Romanticism. The University of California, Davis. Vol. 12. pp. 52-61. April 2006. Other noted reasons for a vegetarian diet included reduced canine teeth and the lack of claws or talons in the human body which made it almost impossible to hunt and kill another animal without the aid of manufactured tools, as well as the length of the human intestines which made it more difficult to digest meat.Oerlemans, Onno. Romanticism and the Materiality of Nature. Toronto; Buffalo: University of Toronto Press. 2002. George Cheyne, a physician who followed a vegetarian diet, concluded that diseases had increased and longevity had decreased largely due to the incorporation of meat into the diet. A vegetarian diet was promoted as the pure and natural diet, uncorrupted by the flesh of other living beings. As stated by Timothy Morton, \\"vegetarian food was thought to be closer in form to the diet of early humans...it was a symptom of the relatively developed but not yet decadent phase of agricultural society,\\" decadence being the consumption of meat. Humans were not the only ones thought to suffer physically under a diet rich in meat; animals themselves were suffering of infections and disease. Confinement of farm animals provided a conduit for disease and illness to spread among mistreated animals, according to Morris, and the food fed to farm animals was also brought into question as a factor contributing to widespread illness.Adams, Carol. ‚ÄúRobert Morris and a Lost 18th-Century Vegetarian Book.‚Äù Organization and Environment. Vol. 18, no. 4. pp. 458-466. 2005. The notion \\"you are what you eat\\" traces its origins to the Romantic Era, which was intended to have physical and moral implications. Not only was meat thought to desecrate the human body, but it was also accredited with encouraging the consumption of alcohol and \\"other destructive habits of life\\".Ruston, Sharon. ‚ÄúVegetarianism and Vitality in the Work of Thomas Forster, William Lawrence and P.B. Shelley.‚Äù Keats-Shelley Journal. Vol. 54. pp. 113-132. 2005. The Romantics secured the link between the physical and moral natures of man, as Percy Shelley states in Natural Diet, \\"I hold that the depravity of the physical and moral nature of man originated in his unnatural habits of life\\". As man was assumed to be naturally healthy, it was society that polluted his body; a case of diseased health erupting out of a diseased society. Environment Those committed to vegetarianism were also concerned with the health of the environment. Raising animals for food was very taxing on the environment, and highly inefficient as far as yielding the most food. As Shelley noted, \\"the quantity of nutritious vegetable matter, consumed in fattening the carcase of an ox, would afford ten times the sustenance if gathered immediately from the bosom of the earth\\". Animal husbandry was regarded as economically wasteful and an assault upon the relationship between nature's ability to provide food and man's harvesting of that food. Religion Prior to the Romantic Era, \\"vegetarianism had been primarily the reserve of religious mystics, ascetics and the odd quack physician\\". Yet with the rise of Romanticism, religion came under scrutiny and new meaning was found within old doctrine. Considering Christianity, vegetarians noted that only after the Flood was permission given to eat flesh and not beforehand, further promoting the belief that the true natural diet of man did not include meat. Thoughts of reincarnation gave rise to the consideration that animals had souls and as such demanded recognition as sentient beings. This line of thought is represented in A Mouse's Petition: \\"Beware, lest in the worm you crush/A brother's soul you find (lines 33‚Äì34). Discourse on rights Until the Romantic Era, the chain of being that placed man above animal was widely accepted without challenge and was reflected in the understanding of man. Man was the link between nature and God, what was good about man reflected his connection to God, what was bad reflected man's primitive connection to nature and animals. The Romantic Era rebuked this belief. Robert Morris, an eighteenth-century architectural innovator, went as far as to say that \\"to usurp an Authority over any other part of the Chain is indeed Pride, rank Pride, and Haughtiness of Soul\\".Adams 2005 The hierarchical chain of being began to narrow and a more inclusive empathy for all creatures dominated the vegetarian discourse of the period. Allowing for animals to have souls necessitated the reevaluation of man's place in the world, for man was no longer the sole inheritor of moral consideration. Perhaps the most lasting effects of the vegetarian movement during the Romantic Period have to do with the rise of the animal rights movement, as well as the women's rights and civil rights movements that would gain momentum throughout the nineteenth century. Shelley declared that the European diet which included meat \\"was responsible for the worst elements of his society, citing cruelty, tyranny and slavery as direct results. As noted by Ruston, \\"The evidence used in the debates surrounding vegetarianism and vitality in the Romantic Period offered a means to argue for the equal rights of all men whether white or black, for women to be regarded as deserving equal rights to men, for dissenters to ask for toleration and enfranchisement and for the rights of animals. The change in how people viewed their relationships between other humans and animals went through a dramatic change. Taking a lead from Pythagoras's Golden Rule of doing to others as would be done to oneself, a shift was made away from asserting human dominance over nature and in turn led to the notion that humans have no rights to nature as it is common to all creatures. This notion had a profound effect on the vegetarian movement, as Morris stated, \\"If we could claim no right to the bodies of animals, we had no power to destroy. The sparrow and the fish of the sea are in common to all, no man claims a particular right to them, therefore has no power by nature over them to kill\\". As Percy Shelley remarked, \\"Of all rapacious animals, man is the most universal destroyer\\". Vegetarianism was a way for people to return to nature with a more respectful and inclusive approach to the natural world. In Animal Food, Joseph Ritson concludes, \\"The only mode in which man or brute can be useful or happy, with respect either to the generality or to the individual, is to be just, mild, merciful, benevolent, humane, or, at least, innocent or harmless, whether such qualities are natural or not\\". As concluded by Morton, \\"Vegetarianism was many things during the Romantic Period: a cutting edge of bourgeois consumer style; a thread of continuity from the religious radicalism of the seventeenth century; a logical extension of Enlightenment discourse on the rights of women and men\\". The modern vegetarian movement follows much of the same discourse. Late Romantic Contemporaries of Vegetarianism Thomas Tryon Thomas Tryon (1634‚Äì1703), an English merchant and author, was one of the earliest supporters of vegetarianism. He established a connection between carnivorous eating habits and slavery, claiming both were immoral and inhumane. He argued that the eating of flesh was never for necessity, but rather a means for man to satisfy his hunger for dominance. According to Tryon, the killing and consumption of animals is nothing but an assertion of power over innocent, defenseless animals.Morton, Timothy, \\"Joseph Ritson, Percy Shelley and the Making of Romantic Vegetarianism,\\" Romanticism. Vol. 12, Issue 1. pp. 52‚Äì61 Alexander Pope Alexander Pope painted by Michael Dahl. Alexander Pope (1688‚Äì1744) was another literary influence on the practice of vegetarianism. In The Guardian, Pope‚Äôs essay, ‚ÄúAgainst Barbarity to Animals,‚Äù paints a gruesome picture of animal slaughter. He writes, ‚ÄúI know nothing more shocking or horrid than the prospect of one of their [the humans‚Äô] kitchens covered with blood, and filled with the cries of creatures expiring in tortures‚Äù.\\"Against Barbarity to Animals,\\" The Guardian, No. 61, 1713 Pope viewed the slaughter of animals as an exercise of tyranny. Like Tryon, Pope believed animal consumption was the product of man‚Äôs desire for dominion over all those inferior. He too put considerable blame on Enlightenment influences of politics, profit, and industrialization and he advocated in favor of vegetarianism as a means of rebelling against such tyrannical urges. Joseph Ritson Joseph Ritson (1752‚Äì1803), an English antiquary, was a radical vegetarian. Besides his arguments on physiognomy and anthropology in relation to a pro-vegetarian lifestyle, he also saw vegetarianism as a means of preventing medical ailments, advocating vegetarianism as a means of living to a ‚Äúgreen old age‚Äù.Ritson, Joseph, \\"An Essay on Abstinence from Animal Food, as a Moral Duty,\\" edited by Sir Richard Philips; London, 1802, (Kessinger Publishing 2009), pp 5 In his An Essay on Abstinence from Animal Food, as a Moral Duty, he argued that the a complete abstinence from meat consumption would cure any human disease or medical ailment.Spencer, Colin, The Heretic's Feast: A History of Vegetarianism; Great Britain: Hartnolls Ltd, Bodmin. 1993, pp 234 He also argued that the practice of consuming your ‚Äúfellow creatures‚Äù was cruel and unnecessary. He emphasized the unfeeling emotions associated with animal slaughter and the resulting disconnect from nature that it caused. A pursuer of Romantic ideals and aesthetics of nature, Ritson classified the hunting and killing of animals as pure ‚Äúblood sport,‚Äù an act that demoted humans to a savage and diabolical existence.\\"Joseph Ritson, Percy Shelley, and the Making of Romantic Vegetarianism,\\" Romanticism. Vol. 12. Issue 1. pp. 57 He argued that the pursuance of this ‚Äúsport‚Äù only further corrupted humans‚Äô natural temper and turned one away from the appreciation of the sublimity of nature. Percy Bysshe Shelley Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792‚Äì1822) aligned most of his views on vegetarianism with those of Ritson. Like Ritson, Shelley believed that a meatless diet was the best mode of consumption for a healthy, disease-free life. He believed that human disease could be alleviated by a simple reversion back to a plant-based diet.Spencer, Colin, The Heretic's Feast: A History of Vegetarianism; Great Britain: Hartnolls Ltd, Bodmin. 1993, pp 244‚Äì45 The eating of meat, to Shelley, was a practice that polluted the body with syphilis, among other unpleasant ailments. In A Vindication of Natural Diet he wrote, \\"Should ever a physician be born with the genius of Locke, I am persuaded that he might trace all bodily and mental derangements to our unnatural habits,\\"Shelley, Percy Bysshe, \\"A Vindication of Natural Diet;\\" London: Smith & Davy. 1813, pp 16 these unnatural habits being the consumption of meat. He compared the negative effects of a meat-based diet to alcoholism, asking, \\"How many thousands have become murderers and robbers, bigots and domestic tyrants, dissolute and abandoned adventurers, from the use of fermented liquors?\\".Shelley, Percy Bysshe, \\"A Vindication of Natural Diet;\\" London: Smith & Davy. 1813, pp 16 He goes on to suggest that, a human of gentle disposition towards animals, \\"rising from a meal of roots,\\" will be a healthy man whose only threat of death will be that of his own natural, old age.Shelley, Percy Bysshe, \\"A Vindication of Natural Diet;\\" London: Smith & Davy. 1813, pp 1‚Äì36 Notes Bibliography *Berlin, Isaiah, \\"The Counter Enlightenment\\" in The Proper Study of Mankind: An Anthology of Essays. *Buffon, Georges-Louis Leclerc Comte de, Histoire naturelle; Vol. 4, pp. 382\\\\. *Kenyon-Jones, Christine, Kindred Brutes: Animals in Romantic-Period Writing; UK: Ashgate Publishing. 2001. *Morton, Timothy, Cultures of Taste/Theories of Appetite: Eating Romanticism; New York: Palgrave Macmillan. 2004. *Morton, Timothy, \\"Joseph Ritson, Percy Shelley and the Making of Romantic Vegetarianism,\\" Romanticism.

Ltd. He was the pioneer of commercial cable television network in Nepal with over 1,000 kilometres of cable network. He also had two newspapers (now closed) and a television channel Channel Nepal, which was the first satellite television station in Nepal.  Career  Jamin Shah, a media tycoon, was the owner of two newspapers, a television station and had a virtual monopoly in the distribution of satellite television channel in Kathmandu through his large cable network. Jamin Shah worked for the first company in Nepal to uplink via satellite. Two days before the launch, the Ministry of Information and Communication told the Space and Time company it had an incomplete test of its equipment. Space and Time was trying to get the approval from the government to begin. They figured all paperwork was in order. However, the green light was yet to come. Space and Time was also beginning to have issues with India, China, and Pakistan. Space and Time suspended India's viewing for a week. The satellite license was important to Shah because with it, Channel Nepal would be beamed to 52 countries in Asia. Jamin received his license in 1993. However, his license was later revoked by the government on the grounds that the company had not paid its dues. The company was allowed to go ahead with transmission but wanted to expand further. He was accused of being a henchman of Dawood Ibrahim and Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, which he denied, and was blamed for using his television channel to whip up anti-India violence. Channel Nepal was banned temporarily in 2000 after wrongly attributing anti-Nepal comments to Bollywood star Hrithik Roshan, sparking riots which left four people dead and 180 people injured in Nepal.  Death  Jamin Shah was murdered outside the French Embassy (pictured) in Kamandu. Jamin Shah was gunned down by two assailants on motorcycles near the French embassy on 7 February 2010 in Kathmandu. The assailants were on a motorcycle with plate number Ba15Pa8733. Shah was accused of having ties to both a major Indian crime syndicate and to Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency. Shah received two gun shots to the head and one shot to the chest after being shot in broad daylight. He later died of his injuries. Shah had received death threats prior to being gunned down. He was under a lot of stress in the days before the attack.  Investigation  The police linked Shah while alive to the Indian underworld including Dawood Ibrahim, India's most wanted. Shah had previously denied these allegations. India's underworld don Bhagwant Singh, alias Bharat Nepali, confessed to Jamin Shah's death. He said, \\"We killed Jamim.

At large are Jagadish Chand, a former deputy superintendent of the Police and Dri Drishna Poudel, a sub- inspector of the Nepal Police.  Context  Since Jamin Shah was conducting business in the Indian subcontinent, it was believed early on that his murder had something to do with conflict between India and Pakistan. Before Shah's murder, Uma Singh, a reporter for Radio Today FM, was hacked to death in her own home. She was also a Women's Right Advocate. After Singh's murder, violence in Nepal against media increased. Around the time of Shah's death, more journalists were receiving threats. The criminal underworld is still a concern by police, as well. According to a report, three police officers planned Jamin Shahs death.http://www.nepalnews.com/index.php/news/19-news/general/4659-case-filed- against-five-persons-in-connection-with-jamim-shah-murder  Reaction  In popular culture in Nepal, Shah's death attracted national attention and his murder was examined on national TV.

A second major function was to train reinforcements to be sent to the Canadian divisions in Europe. Pacific Command combined the pre-war Military District No. 11 (British Columbia and the Yukon Territory) with Military District No. 13 (Alberta and the District of Mackenzie of the Northwest Territories). The command headquarters was initially housed in Esquimalt Fortress near Victoria, but on November 30, 1942 it was moved to the Old Vancouver Hotel in downtown Vancouver. After the United States entered the war in December 1941, Canada and the U.S. coordinated their defense of the west coast of North America. Thus Pacific Command operated in close cooperation with Western Defense Command to the south and with Alaska Defense Command to the north. The troops of Pacific Command were concentrated in the three strategic coastal centres: * Victoria- Esquimalt, the capital of British Columbia and the location of Canada's Pacific naval base and headquarters * Vancouver, the largest city in British Columbia, Canada's largest port on the Pacific, and the Pacific terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway * Prince Rupert, the second Pacific terminus of the Canadian National Railway (in addition to Vancouver) By the middle of the war a significant proportion of the troops of Pacific Command were conscripts under the National Resources Mobilization Act (NRMA) adopted in June 1940. This act precluded the use of conscripts in overseas operations. However, a plebiscite held in April 1942 released the Canadian government from this restriction (see the Conscription Crisis of 1944). Even after the plebiscite, the government was reluctant to send conscripts into combat outside of North America. The Terrace Mutiny occurred in November 1944 among troops of Pacific Command when it was learned that the government of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King had decided to start sending conscripts to Europe to reinforce depleted combat units. In August 1943 troops of Pacific Command participated in Operation Cottage, in the final stages of the Aleutian Islands campaign. However, that campaign ended without a shot being fired at the enemy when it was discovered that the Japanese occupiers of Kiska had already evacuated the island. The only \\"enemy\\" the Pacific Command troops inflicted upon physically were American forces, after a Canadian soldier mistakenly shot at American lines, causing a sporadic friendly fire incident between the two forces that left 28 Americans and four Canadians dead, with 50 others injured. Apart from one incident when a Japanese submarine shelled the lighthouse at Estevan Point on June 20, 1942, and the arrival of ineffectual fire balloons launched from Japan between November 1944 and April 1945, the feared military threat from Japan never materialized. The two home defence infantry divisions attached to Pacific Command were thus broken up and their personnel were redistributed to other formations. General Order Number 21/1946, dated 28th January 1946, effective 23rd January, 1946 authorized five Commands, among which was the new Western Command (Canada), which appears to have absorbed the area of the former Pacific Command.https://www.canadiansoldiers.com/organization/districts.htm Composition *Victoria and Esquimalt Fortress **31st (Alberta) Reconnaissance Regiment, CAC **5th (B.C.)

Katsura blazed a trail for women in the sport by competing and placing among the best in the male-dominated world of professional billiards. First learning the game from her brother-in-law and then under the tutelage of Japanese champion Kinrey Matsuyama, Katsura became Japan's only female professional player. In competition in Japan, she took second place in the country's national three- cushion billiards championship three times. In exhibition she was noted for 10,000 points at the game of straight rail. After marrying a U.S. Army non- commissioned officer in 1950, Katsura emigrated with him to the United States in 1951. There she was invited to play in the 1952 U.S.-sponsored World Three- Cushion Championship, ultimately taking seventh place at that competition. Katsura was the first woman ever to be included in any world billiards tournament. Her fame cemented, Katsura went on an exhibition tour of the United States with eight-time world champion Welker Cochran, and later with 51-time world champion Willie Hoppe. In 1953 and 1954, she again competed for the world three-cushion crown, taking fifth and fourth places respectively. Little was seen of Katsura for the next few years. She made 30 exhibition appearances in 1958, and went on a one-week exhibition engagement the following year with Harold Worst, but did not compete in any professional tournaments. In 1959, she made two television appearances on ABC's You Asked for It, and one on the CBS primetime television hit What's My Line?. Katsura returned to competition in 1961, playing a challenge match for the World Three-Cushion title against Worst, then reigning world champion, and was defeated by him. Katsura disappeared from the sport thereafter, only making a brief impromptu appearance in 1976. She moved back to Japan around 1990 and died in 1995. Life and career Early years Little is known about Katsura's childhood in Japan. Katsura had three sisters and a brother. Their father died when Katsura was 12 years old and she went to live with her older sister and her sister's husband, Tomio Kobashi, who owned a billiard parlor. By 13 she was spending time in her brother-in-law's billiard room, and by 14 she was working as a billiard attendant there. Kobashi was a fine player and taught Katsura the fundamentals of various carom billiards games. Katsura also had a billiard table at home, bought by her family after she showed intense interest in the sport. Katsura practiced diligently, and began competing against Japanese men and beating them. At just 15, Katsura won the women's championship straight rail tournament of Japan. \\"Then I turned professional and began touring with a sister all over Japan, China and Formosa\\", said Katsura in a 1959 interview. Katsura's two younger sisters, Noriko and Tadako, also won the women's straight rail championship in other years. (Date of world championship provided here (1951 rather than 1952) is incorrect per hundreds of newspaper articles) In 1937, Katsura met Kinrey Matsuyama, who had won Japan's national three-cushion championship multiple times. Matsuyama was also U.S. national champion in 1934, runner-up three other times and had four second-place finishes in world competition at 18.2 balkline prior to World War II. Matsuyama was impressed with Katsura and began teaching her top level play. By 1947, Katsura was a long-established billiard star in Japan‚Äîthe country's only female professional player. Marriage and titles in Japan During 1947 Katsura caught the eye of American serviceman Vernon Greenleaf (no relation to the pool and carom billiards champion Ralph Greenleaf), a master sergeant in the U.S. Army's Quartermaster Corps who had been in the armed services for 22 years. Katsura and Greenleaf first met in a Tokyo service club where she was giving billiard exhibitions. Greenleaf began taking lessons from Katsura and was quickly smitten with her. They were married on November 30, 1950, but never had any children. At the time of their marriage Katsura already boasted two second-place finishes at Japan's national three-cushion championship; one from the year prior to their wedding. She claimed the runner-up spot for a third time the year of her marriage. About that time she accomplished the lofty feat of scoring 10,000 contiguous points at straight rail in an exhibition by the balls around the table 27 times over about hours. She stopped at 10,000 points only because it was a benchmark round number. In later years she said that her high run in three-cushion billiards (number of points scored consecutively in a single inning) was 19. Emigration to the U.S. In 1951 Greenleaf was transferred to a U.S. post from Haneda Air Base in Tokyo. He and Katsura, who spoke little English, set sail for the United States on the USS Breckinridge, debarking in San Francisco at the end of December 1951, just a few months before the 1952 World Three- Cushion Billiards tournament was scheduled to begin in that city on March 6. Katsura had been conditionally invited to play at the world championship after Cochran, whose billiard parlor was hosting the tournament, had heard of her brilliance from Matsuyama. Cochran was an 8-time world champion having won the world crown at three-cushion billiards in 1933, 1935, 1937, 1938, 1944 and 1945, and at 18.2 balkline, in 1927 and 1934. Cochran sent his son, W. R. (Dick) Cochran, a naval officer stationed in Japan, to investigate and received back a glowing report that said (possibly to Cochran's annoyance), \\"this girl is better than you are!\\" Though the decision was ultimately in the hands of the Billiard Congress of America as tournament sponsor, they gave Cochran the option to invite her. After Katsura arrived in the U.S., she gave a private exhibition for Cochran, who wanted to make sure she was as good as reported before finalizing the invitation. At that meeting she clicked off runs of 300 and 400 at straight rail, made in the words of Cochran \\"almost unbelievable shots\\" after switching to balkline, and showed high competence at three-cushion, consistently scoring. Cochran made the invitation \\"final\\" and stated: \\"She's the most marvelous thing I ever saw... She's liable to beat anybody, even Willie Hoppe... I could not see any weak spots... She's going to give lots of those players fits.\\" As a warm-up for the competition Katsura gave a number of billiard exhibitions during February 1952. 1952 World Three-Cushion Billiards tournament First woman to compete for a world title Katsura's participation in the 1952 World Three-Cushion Billiards title marked the first time that a woman had competed for any world billiards title. This was only ten years after Ruth McGinness became the first woman to have ever been invited to play in any men's professional billiard championship (the New York State Championship of 1942). The defending champion was the then 64-year-old internationally renowned Willie Hoppe, who would retire later that year with 51 world titles to his name between 1906 and 1952 in three forms of carom billiards: balkline, one-cushion, and three-cushion. Before the tournament, speculation had it that when Hoppe met Katsura in the championship in the to 50 points format, he would defeat her with Katsura still needing at least 40. After seeing her play, Hoppe said \\"she has a fine stroke and can make shots with either hand. I look forward to playing with her.\\" The public was fascinated by the novelty of a woman player. Life magazine reported that \\"San Franciscans who did not know a cue from a cucumber crowded in to see her... Katy ... stole the show.\\" Tournament roster The 10 champions slated to play in the round robin format tournament were Katsura, her mentor, Matsuyama, favorite and defending champion Willie Hoppe, Mexican champion Joe Chamaco, Herb Hardt of Chicago, New York's Art Rubin, Los Angeles' Joe Procita, Ray Kilgore of San Francisco, Jay Bozeman of Vallejo and Binghamton's Irving Crane. The championship between the invitees was to take place at Cochran's 924 Club, with 45 total games to be played (each player to play every other once) over the 17-day tournament ending on March 22, 1952. The tournament was reported to have \\"The greatest billiard field since before World War II\\". First place earned a $2,000 purse (today $), plus thousands in exhibition fees. Following behind to eight places were prizes of $1,000, $700, $500, $350, $300, $250 and $250 respectively. Detail of play On the second day of the competition, March 7, 1952, Katsura drew Irving Crane for her first match. They made quite a contrast as Crane was the tallest player at the tourney, while Katsura was described by reporter Curley Grieve of the San Francisco Examiner as \\"so small and doll-like she looks like a figurine in her flowing, gold-satin gown.\\" Crane's main discipline was straight pool, at which he won numerous championships, including six world titles. The match was close, but Crane prevailed 50 to 42 in 57 . On March 10, Katsura defeated Herb Hardt 50 to 42 in 58 innings. Katsura was significantly behind at one point but counted 15 points in five innings to take the lead. On March 11, she lost to Chamaco, 50 to 35, but the following day Katsura upset Procita 50‚Äì43 in 63 innings, with runs of six, five and four. \\"Spectators exclaimed 'brilliant' and 'sensational' at some of her shots.\\" On March 14, Katsura faced the undefeated Hoppe, losing 50 to 31 in 36 innings. Though Hoppe was a darling of the public, the crowd of more than 500 spectators was clearly rooting for Katsura throughout. The next day she faced her mentor, Matsuyama, considered the contender with the best shot at beating Hoppe. Matsuyama edged out his prot√©g√© with a close 50 to 48 finish in 51 innings. By the 21st inning Matsuyama held a 29‚Äì21 lead. Katsura battled back, the score 43‚Äì42 in her favor by inning 33, but Matsuyama ran three in the 46th inning, and Katsura could not close the gap. Mentor and prot√©g√© alike posted high runs of six in the match Chart recording final standings for the 1952 World Three-Cushion tournament. The form emulates that of the original handwritten chart used at the tournament. The three numbers in each box are read as follows: the top number is the points scored by the player; at bottom right is the number of innings; at bottom left is the player's high run. On March 18 Katsura trounced Art Rubin 50‚Äì28 in 58 innings. but was handed a worse defeat in her next match on March 20, losing to Bozeman 50 to 18 in 52 innings. In her last match on March 21, Katsura pulled off a 50‚Äì46 win against Kilgore in 61 innings. This was the biggest upset of the tournament. Kilgore, the \\"Giant Killer\\", was the only player other than Matsuyama who was considered to have a fighting chance at dethroning Hoppe. Between this win and her earlier win over Procita, Katsura had beaten the only two players in the tournament that had won their matches against Hoppe. That evening a separate exhibition match between Katsura and Kilgore was featured on KRON-TV, with commentary provided by Cochran. The next day the tournament concluded with Hoppe repeating as champion as he had so many times before. Katsura took seventh place, ahead of Procita at eighth place, Chamaco at ninth and Rubin at tenth. Above her were Crane at sixth, Rubin at fifth, Kilgore at fourth, Bozeman at third and Matsuyama as runner-up. Following the competition, Jay Bozeman, said \\"We've found it hard to believe that a woman could actually step into the best billiard championship in the world and hold her own. Miss Katsura is one of the finest players I've faced in a world's tournament, while Welker Cochran, five-time holder of the Billiards World Crown, predicted: \\"Given another two or three years of American competition and she will be the world's champion.... Masako has opened a new field for women. Her presence has made the game attractive to women for the first time. She has the power of a man and strokes beautifully. Her maneuvers with the cue ball are fantastic. All she needs is a bit more experience and she will be unbeatable.\\" Exhibition tours Soon after the 1952 championship, Cochran announced he was coming out of a seven-year retirement to play an exhibition tour with Katsura. \\"Millions of fans want to see this charming first lady of billiards\\" he said, \\"now some of them can.\\" The duo previewed their tour with a three-day engagement at the Garden City Parlor in San Jose starting on April 18, 1952. Thereafter, they planned stops in Kansas City (May 2‚Äì3); Chicago (May 5‚Äì11); Detroit in mid- May; and on to tentative stops in Cleveland, Buffalo, Boston, Philadelphia, Dallas, San Diego, Los Angeles and Long Beach. The format was to be a 100-point straight-rail match, followed by a 50-point three-cushion game played under tournament conditions with trick or \\"fancy\\" shots to follow. Katsura stated prior to departing: \\"I hope my tour will convince women that billiards is not only a man's game. Women can play just as well as men.\\" Billiards champion Tex Zimmerman (Cochran's partner in the 924 Club) and well known pool hustler Danny McGoorty had a hand in organizing the tour. In preparation, they played up Katsura's exoticness and her physical attractiveness. Tex Zimmerman's wife sewed tight-fitting kimonos for Katsura, slit up the side, which she wore during her exhibitions with high heels. Katsura was a tiny woman, weighing between 88 and 96 pounds. and standing 5 feet tall‚Äîjust about the height of a standard cue stick. McGoorty later mused: \\"Masako was cute! She was thirty-nine years old but she looked twenty-nine. She hopped around that table on her high heels, giving the fans a little smile, and everybody loved her.\\" It was Katsura's playing ability, though, rather than her other charms, that made her a phenomenon. When Cochran returned from his tour with Katsura he told McGoorty, who was a world class player in his own right, \\"you will have trouble with her.\\" When they finally got a chance to play, the match drew crowds. \\"They could have sold seats in the toilet!\\" McGoorty exclaimed. After the match, McGoorty confirmed Cochran's prediction: A number of pre-booked stops on the tour suffered from lack of attendance. Cochran was very bitter about it. NEA sports editor, Harry Grayson indicated that the game was in general decline, and said that Cochran \\"traces the decline of championship and exhibition billiards to manufacturers taking the stars off the payroll during the depression.\\" In a previous exhibition tour by Cochran and Hoppe in 1945, they had sold out in 13 cities. Despite some lackluster stops, upon her return to California, Katsura continued to play exhibition matches with the game's greats. Katsura and Kilgore put on a week-long exhibition in San Francisco in January 1953, where they seesawed back and forth. On January 12, Katsura beat Kilgore in their first match with runs of seven and ten, but lost to him in their second. The total points scored by the two at that time was 349 for Katsura to Kilgore's 379. Katsura started another exhibition series with Cochran at his club in February 1953 and, tuning up for the 1953 world tournament, to start on March 26, went on a nationwide tour with Willie Hoppe in the latter part of February 1953. The 30-day tour of the northeastern U.S. included Chicago, Boston and other locations. Her husband accompanied her to provide translation. In their multiple-day exhibition match in Chicago, it was reported in the midst that Katsura had unsurprisingly won only one out of four matches against Hoppe, often pegged as the greatest player of all time. 1953‚Äì1954 1953 World Three-Cushion tournament With Hoppe retired as of 1952, there was excitement over who would take the 1953 world three-cushion crown, to be held in Chicago at the Chicago Town Club in the Sheraton Hotel. Eleven competitors were slated to play, many repeats of the prior year, including Chamaco, Katsura, Matsuyama, Bozeman, Kilgore, Procita and Rubin. New to the field were Harold Worst of Grand Rapids, Hollywood's John Fitzpatrick, Mel Lundberg of Minneapolis and Ezequiel Navarra of Argentina. Navarra was considered the favorite by experts, having won championships that year in Cuba, Colombia, Peru and Argentina and having just come off an exhibition tour with Cochran in which Navarra averaged a formidable 1.16, scoring 1,295 three-cushions in 1,120 innings over the length of the tour. In Katsura's first match she defeated Lundberg 50‚Äì44, in 71 innings. Thereafter she: lost to Matsuyama 50 to 37 in 39 innings; lost to Rubin, 50‚Äì37, in 52 innings; beat Fitzpatrick 50‚Äì38 in 50 innings, undefeated to that point; beat Chamaco 50 to 44, in 56 innings with a high run of eight; upset favorite Navarra 50 to 40 in 43 innings; followed by a loss to Kilgore, 50 to 41, in 42 innings; and a loss to Harold Worst 50 to 42, in 52 innings; but then defeated Bozeman 50‚Äì48 in 60 innings in her last match. When the dust had settled, Katsura shared fifth place with Matsuyama, each having won and lost five matches. The winner of the world crown was Kilgore with an eight-win, two-loss record. Navarra and Bozeman tied for second. Exhibitions and death of Matsuyama Matsyama exhibition to be held on April 22, 1953, in a Long Beach, California, billiard parlor After the 1953 championship wrapped up, Katsura and Matsuyama gave an exhibition together in Long Beach, California (advertisement at right). The format was 100 points at balkline, followed by a race to 40 at three-cushion and then a trick shot exhibition. Katsura crushed her teacher, 100‚Äì11 and 100‚Äì3 at balkline, but Matsuyama won both the three-cushion matches, 40‚Äì34 and 40‚Äì39. This was Katsura and Matsuyama's last close interaction. After returning to Japan, Matsuyama suffered a heart attack and died on December 20, 1953. He had had plans to move to Honolulu with his family, become an American citizen, and purchase a billiard parlor. His eldest son, Hideo, 18, was attending a San Francisco high school at the time. He was said to have taught all of Japan's top players, among which Katsura was the star pupil. Next, Katsura played a five-day, 600 point three-cushion exhibition series with Ray Kilgore in San Francisco, March 12‚Äì17, 1953. At the end Kilgore was the winner with a final score of 600 to 547. Kilgore said: \\"She played really remarkable billiards and I played a little over my head.\\" The next week Katsura faced Kilgore again in another exhibition at Welker Cochran's room, beating him 50‚Äì33 in 45 innings. 1954 World Three-Cushion tournament The 1954 World Three-Cushion tournament was held in Buenos Aires with only 8 contestants: Katsura; Ray Miller of Jackson, Michigan; Harold Worst; Argentinian brothers Juan and Ezequiel Navarra; Welker Cochran, who had come out of retirement; Chamaco; and defending champion, Kilgore. As usual, Katsura was the sole female contestant. In her first round she was victorious over Miller, 60‚Äì47 in 76 innings, then beat Chamaco 60‚Äì55, but followed with a loss to Ezequiel Navarra 60‚Äì28 in 48 innings. Katsura then beat his brother, Juan Navarra, 60‚Äì52 in 77 innings in her last match to take fourth place overall. On the last day Harold Worst and Ezequiel Navarra ended in a tie with a playoff to be held initially to 60 points, later raised to a 350 point format, at which Worst ultimately prevailed on October 25, 1954. 1955‚Äì1961 Hiatus and exhibition Little was seen of Katsura for the next few years. She made 30 exhibition appearances in 1958 but had been in \\"virtual retirement\\" for about five years. During this break the second of Katsura's two billiards instruction books came out in Japan: ÊíûÁêÉ‰∏äÈÅîÊ≥ï (1956) (\\"Improve Your Billiards\\"). An earlier primer, ÊíûÁêÉÂÖ•ÈñÄ (\\"Introduction to Billiards\\"), was published in 1952. In 1959 it was announced that Katsura and Harold Worst would compete in a one week exhibition match to 1,200 points, beginning February 9 at Randolph Recreations in Chicago. Worst and Katsura moved their show to Philadelphia next where they played six matches at three-cushion billiards to 50 points, and thereafter went to exhibit in New York. TV spots On March 1, 1959, Katsura appeared on CBS' popular primetime television show, What's My Line? The show was in the format of a guessing game, in which a panel attempted to determine the line (occupation), or in the case of a famous \\"mystery guest\\", the identity of the contestant. After she signed in using Japanese characters on a chalk board, show officials listed Katsura's occupation for the audience as \\"Professional Billiard Player (World's Women's Champion)\\". Panelist Arlene Francis was successful in guessing Katsura's occupation, though she admitted that she had read about her but said she had never seen her picture. Later that month Katsura made a guest appearance on ABC's You Asked For It, going behind the scenes of westerns to show how television productions set up and filmed a covered wagon rolling over and crashing on cue. She appeared again on You Asked For It in a November 25, 1960 broadcast, this time operating in her bailiwick, demonstrating trick shots for the camera. 1961 title match with Worst By 1961 and for a few years prior, there was no longer an organized world three-cushion championship. Accordingly, Harold Worst, the reigning champion since 1954, issued a challenge match to Katsura to defend his title, with the match to take place March 13‚Äì18 of that year at the Pantlind Hotel in Grand Rapids, Michigan, for a purse of $2,000. The preceding year Worst had issued a similar title-defending challenge to Joe Chamaco of Mexico, which also took place in Grand Rapids at the same venue. Worst even took unsuccessful legal action to block an Argentinian three-cushion tournament, billed as a \\"world title\\" event, that was scheduled to overlap the dates of his title match with Katsura. Worst defeated Katsura in six out of seven matches, with total three-cushions scored between them, respectively, of 350 and 276. Meanwhile, Chamaco claimed the world crown as well, after winning the tournament in Argentina. After 1961 Little was heard from Katsura for many years after the 1961 world championship. McGoorty lamented her retirement, stating various theories that he had heard bandied about in billiard circles, such as that her husband (who died in June 1967) kept her from playing for various reasons. In 1976 Katsura made an impromptu appearance at Palace Billiards in San Francisco. She borrowed a cue from someone present and proceeded to run 100 points at straight rail without problem. Prolific pool and billiard author Robert Byrne wrote that after Katsura finished that 100-point run, \\"without a miss she smiled and bowed to the applauding crowd, stepping away from the spotlight, and disappeared forever from the American billiard stage.\\" Katsura returned to Japan in or about 1990 to live with her sister, Noriko, where she said she planned to live out her days. Katsura died in 1995. In September 2002 a memorial tournament for Katsura, billed as Katsura Memorial: The First Ladies Three Cushion Grandprix, was held in Japan and aired on SKY PerfecTV!

It tells the tale of an alligator called Alli and his child-friendly experiences with a painful tooth and a dentist's surgery. It was published by Lothrop, Lee & Shepard. Plot synopsis The book tells the story of an alligator named Alli, who lives at the zoo. One morning Alli wakes up with a terrible toothache, and feels miserable. His fellow zoo-animal friends offer well-meaning but non-productive suggestions regarding the toothache, and the zookeeper has nothing in his veterinary supplies to help Alli's pain. So Alli is obliged to catch a city bus to see the dentist, a trip he abhors because he fears that the dentist may be a cruel, sadistic monster whose operation will be even more painful than his toothache. But having never traveled alone before, Alli unknowingly boards the wrong bus, and thus is on his way to an entirely wrong part of the city. His initial mistake turns out to be a stroke of incredibly good luck, however --- while riding the bus through its assigned route, Alli meets a friendly little boy on the bus who is also traveling the same way, and he soon discovers that the lad is, in fact, the dentist's young son! Encouraged by the kind boy's earnest reassurances that his father is, in fact, a kind, caring knowledgeable man, and by his promise to accompany Alli to the dentist's office and hold his hand throughout the operation, Alli at last musters the courage to make the trip to the dentist's office, where he learns, to his great surprise and delight, that his toothache was caused by nothing more than a wisdom tooth that had started to grow in. Reception Kathleen Martin praised both the dialogues and drawings, saying the book \\"shows the exceptional talents of Marguerite Dorian.\\" Martin, who reviewed the book at its time of release, highlighted the \\"natural conversations\\" between the main characters, as well as the author's choice of \\"greens and reds\\". Kirkus Reviews stated \\"The outlandish idea of a cowardly alligator with a toothache will buttress the courage of his human counterparts on future dental safaris.\\" while another review found that \\"Although the story seems over-extended, it has occasional bits of humor and warmth; the writing has a pleasant simplicity, but the plot and its development are very weak.\\" References Category:American picture books Category:1962 children's books Category:Fictional crocodilians Category:Animal tales ","title":"The Alligator's Toothache"},{"id":"26114702","text":"Croatian national costume from Vrlika. Women from Meƒëimurje (northern Croatia) in traditional folk costume. Croatian national costume, also called as Croatian traditional clothing or Croatian dress (, plural: hrvatske narodne no≈°nje), refers to the traditional clothing worn by Croats living in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, with smaller communities in Hungary, Austria, Montenegro, and Romania. Since today Croats wear Western-style clothing on a daily basis, the national costumes are most often worn with connection to special events and celebrations, mostly at ethnic festivals, religious holidays, weddings, and by dancing groups who dance the traditional Croatian kolo, or circle dance. Each cultural and geographical region has its own specific variety of costume that vary in style, material, color, shape, and form. Much of these regional costumes were influenced by the Austrian, Hungarian, German, Italian, or Ottoman Empire presence, due to whichever power ruled the region.Hrvatski foklor: Narodne no≈°nje Main attire Men's Dinaric style costume. For the female dress, attire consists of a plain white dress or blouse (ko≈°ulja) or underskirt (skutiƒái), which is usually the basic form of the costume. It is then added with other clothing and decorations, which may include another overdress or skirt (kotula), a decorative jacket (djaketa, paletun or koret), apron (ogrnjaƒç or pregjaƒça), scarf (ubrsac), kerchief or shawl which are usually decorated with a floral or animal motif. The embroidery is very intricate and is usually red, white, blue, gold, or black. Her jewellery, ranging from necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and rings could consist of gold, silver, beads, pearls, or even corral from the Adriatic. Hair is interwoven into one or two braids and decorated with red ribbons for girls or women that are unmarried, while married women wear woven or silk kerchiefs on their heads. Costumes of brides consists of a crown or wreath often made of flowers (vijenac) and large amounts of jewelry. The woman's head could be adorned by a kerchief, cap, or a headdress, the most famous being the headdresses worn by the women from the island of Pag. The amount of paraphernalia a woman is adorned with, either very much or rarely any at all, depends on the region. Completing the costume are stockings (bjeƒçve) or knee-high socks, and boots or a special kind of sandal called opanci. For the males, the national dress usually consists on loose, wide slacks (gaƒçe ≈°irkoke) and a shirt, and both are usually either black or white, or both. The man may wear a decorative or plain vest (fermen or jaƒçerma), over his shirt, and possibly a waistcoat. The man almost always wears a cap, varying in shape and design depending on the region. The most famous cap is perhaps the Lika cap, worn in the Lika region for centuries by the people. Footwear, like the women's, consists mainly on boots and sandals. Because of the weather, certain places often have woolen vests, cloaks, coats, or fur for the colder regions, and silk and light linens for the warmer climates. There are four main types of costumes associated with the regions: the Pannonian style in the north and east, the continental or Dinaric style, and the coastal style on the coast.Dance Occasions and Festive Dress in Yugoslavia, Elsie Dunin. Croatia Slavonia and Baranya Croatian national dress from Vinkovci Both Slavonia and Baranya are located in the east, and are associated with the Pannonian style of dress and the ≈†okci. In Slavonia, the costumes tend to be very elaborate, with floral designs and clothing with silk or wool, fancy embroidery, decorative silk ribbons and bows, lace work, gold or silver jewelry, corals, amber necklaces and pearls for the women. The colors of the dresses tend to be bright and numerous, with colors ranging from gold, red, blue, white, and black all in one costume. The top shirt, or odnjica, of the costume has fringed-wing sleeves, which is generally associated with the Pannonian style. For the men, they tend to wear not as many colors for the shirt and pants, but often wear thick coats or vests with designs and patterns stitched on and fancy embroidery like the women. Their sleeves might have a slight ruffle at the end, but not as much as the women's In Baranya, a part of the men's costume is a small apron that is worn over the trousers that ranges in color and design. Posavina and Podravina Podravina style dress Posavina and Podravina are both in the north, north-east part of Croatia. Unlike the Slavonians, the costumes from Posavina do not focus on too much elaborate designs and patterns, and instead consists of simple black and white blouses, trousers, and skirts. The men wear black vests and black hats while the women wear beautiful silk shawls, usually blue or red in color with flower motifs. A thick apron with embroidered designs could be worn as well, and their color and detailed patterns are often the main focus of the costume. Although the clothing may be plain, the shawls and/or aprons worn over the blouses and skirts make up for the plain attire in Podravina, and they are sometimes so colorful and richly garnished with patterns that they completely cover up the main dress. The women in Podravina style their own kerchiefs with a unique embroidery from the region, and they wear aprons over their dresses which are colorful and geometric in design and attached with a multi-colored fringe. The men's vests are usually red or black and color and are garnished with intricate patterns and embroidery as well. Meƒëimurje, Zagorje and Zagreb region Dress from the vicinity of Zagreb Dress from Meƒëimurje Meƒëimurje, Zagorje and Zagreb are all located in the north, and are therefore influenced by the continental style. White garments are typical for the continental region, but each has its own decorative scarves, shawls, aprons, and jewellery. Red is the most popular color, especially in Zagorje, and the aprons and vests worn by the men and women are red with elaborate stitching and embroidery, mostly with gold thread. Women wear colorful shawls and kerchiefs which are usually red with flower designs. The second most popular color is black, which could have gold or white embroidery, or none at all. Very often, the men and women would not wear any aprons or shawls, and their costumes would mostly consist of their white garments, which they may stitch a border of color at the ends, or add a sash (tkanica) for some color. Hats are an important part of a male's costume, and can come in two forms: the traditional Pannonian hat (≈°krlak) is black and dome-shaped, with a red wool band embroidered with multi-colored thread and white and gold dots attached, or the black felt box-hat (≈°e≈°ir) folded into a flat bow at the back with a grosgrain ribbon tied around the body.Dance Occasions and Festive Dress in Yugoslavia, by Elsie Dunin. Over the grosgrain ribbon, red, white and blue strings are often tied around the hat (e.g. the Croatian tri-color). Istria Dalmatian style The costumes from Istria are influenced by the Adriatic style of the coast. The men's costumes are typically blue or brown or white, and consist of white, ankle length trousers that are tighter than the Slavonian style, shirts, and leather vests. Coats worn over them are generally short and long-sleeved or long, sleeveless ones. Accessories include wide silk belts, red or black caps, and cotton socks worn over their footwear called opanci (strapped soft soled sandals). Women on the coast wear broad-sleeved white blouses that are embroidered in silk or lace, as well as pleated skirts or dresses varying in color, and stockings under their opanci. They also cover their shoulders with colorful shawls called oplece, which cover the shoulders and tie around the neck, hanging over their arms and upper-chest. Jewellery is made of colorful glass beads and silver coin discs, which are found hanging around the neck and waist by string of leather.The Races and Their Customs Lika Costume from Peru≈°iƒá The costumes of Lika show testament to both the Dinaric and Ottoman influence of the region. Due to the military history of the region, costumes can vary from civilian to military-wear. Because of the ruralness of the region and the prevalence of sheep, wool is spun and dyed (usually red, black, yellow and green) and fur coats and capes are common because of the cold winter weather. Women tend to wear skirts down to their ankles and a white blouse. Their attire is generally in earth-tones, with white, brown, and black being most common, however, blue dresses and aprons are reserved for married women, while white is for the unmarried ones. Unlike the Croats from the north, the special sandals (opanci) are worn daily. However, liberties are taken with the apron, which is often woven with colorful stitching and patterns with geometric motifs. Multi-colored wool socks (priglavci or nazuvci) with various geometric design are worn over the opanci.Dance occasions and festive dress in Yugoslavia, by Elsie Dunin. For headwear, women wear embroidered kerchiefs or white kerchiefs pinned to their hats. Jewelry such as earrings, bracelets, and necklaces are silver, and necklaces (djerdan) and earrings are often made of silver coins, traditionally from the 19th century Austrian coins (talira). The costume of the men varies when taking military uniform in consideration. A simple costume would have trousers and a linen shirt of either white, black or brown color (or blue for military men). The vests can be made of leather, or wool that are either black or red, and can be simple with no designs, or very elaborately designed with intricate patterns. Black or blue coats or capes made of lamb fur are worn during the winter. Red belts or sashes are tied around their waists and used to hold guns or swords, a remnant from the military era. A special carved knife from the Ottoman days (called a hand≈æar or no≈æ) are mainly used. A special cap exclusive to the region is the Lika cap that is worn by all men, regardless of social position. Dalmatia Costume from northern Dalmatia. A man from Sinj. Detail of belt and weapons. Dalmatian costume varies from within its own region; while the coastal areas are Adriatic and Italian in influence, the inner area, called Zagora, shows the Dinaric influence similar to the style of Lika and Herzegovina. Perhaps the most famous example of Zagora costume comes from the small town of Vrlika, rich in dance and tradition still carried on today. Both men and women's dress wear is characterized by multiple subjects of clothing over another.Grad Vrlika: Kultura; Vrliƒçka narodna no≈°nja For men, the costume consists of carefully chosen pieces worn over each other: a red sash is tied around dark pants with a fringe of threads hanging from the belt in red, blue, or green colors. Due to centuries of military mentality, a special leather belt is worn to carry weapons. Over the shirt is a decorated tunic, elaborate in design and custom- made fringe. The vest that is worn is vastly decorated with gold and red embroidery and patterns and designs, with different styles or material and cut depending on the seasonal weather. Much like the men, the women's dress consists of clothing worn over more clothing: a white blouse, skirt or tunic is most common, with a colorful apron consisting of complicated geometric patterns and fringe worn over, as well as a red vest with gold stitching made in a way to make it stand out from the white blouse. Jewellery consists mainly of beads worn around the neck and silver coins adorned around the costume. Both men and women wear red felt pillbox caps (bareta or crvenkapa), with a white habit attached to the women's. From the coast, the national costume of Dubrovnik consists mainly of white, black, gold, and red colors. Both men and women wear vests rich with gold embroidery while the women wear the recognizable gold tassels decorating the front blouse and fine jewelry such as earrings, necklaces and hair clips. Men and women usually wear white or black trousers or skirts respectively. Islands Croatian national dress from the island of Pag The islands of Croatia have the most variation in dress due to their geographic distance and isolation from one another. They find more similarity with Dalmatia and Istria, but many have their own unique styles not seen elsewhere. For example, the national costume from the island of Pag has its origins in the fifteenth century, and is characterized by the intricate lace that decorates the front part of blouses and the edges of kerchiefs.Grad Pag Kultura The famous lace work of Pag is renowned for its precision and beauty, and is the most prominent part of the costume apart from the large white headdresses worn by the women of the island. Women wear long-sleeved blouses and full pleated skirts (usually gold or red in color) with a red silk scarf tied around their waist. The men wear vests over their shirts with form- fitting trousers with a red silk handkerchief worn around the waist and red hats. Bosnia and Herzegovina Costumes of Tomislavgrad Croatian dress from Bosnia and Herzegovina fall under the Dinaric category of dress style, and regional variations between western Herzegovina and central Bosnia is most prominent. In Herzegovina, the style of dress is vastly similar to the inland Dalmatian style. In central Bosnia however, the Ottoman influence is more prominently shown. For women, the dress is mainly white heavy cotton with puckered vertical stripes, while the collar is embroidered with a crocheted trim and dotted with sequins. The vest is generally dark in color with a golden trim embroidered along the edges, and the apron is made of wool, dyed usually red, black, or dark green with minimal designs. If no apron is worn, than the dress may consist of special embroidery and crocheted lace, and pantaloons (gaƒçe) are worn with white, knee-length stockings (ƒçarape). The sash (tkanica) worn around the waist is black with green and gold wool handwoven within. The headscarf can be a kerchief (krpa) with various geometric designs and/or floral embroidery, or more elaborate kind (ƒçember) with a crocheted edge with a wide band of multi-colored geometric embroidery on one side and half of opposite side. For men, white cotton shirts with wide sleeves and black pants with a fringed leg are the basic elements of the costume. The vest is made of thick wool and is dark in color and can be embroidered or crocheted like the females'. The sash around the waist varies in color from region, but is usually dark. Socks are worn to knee length much like the females, and are usually white, red, or gold in color. Elsewhere The Croatian dress from Serbia comes mainly from the Vojvodina region in the north, with the impact of the Pannonian style figuring very strongly. The most common color for both men and women to wear is white, with elaborate embroidery or stitching at the ends or hems or the sleeves, trousers, or skirts. They would wear blue or black aprons and vests over their garments with gold embroidery. But the most notable Croatian costumes come from the Baƒçka region, where for centuries the women have ordered the silk for their costumes from Lyon, France. They come in a rich blue color that has made them recognizable throughout the region. The Croats from Kosovo have a dress that has a more Dinaric style, having adapted many of the Vardarian style of dress into their traditional costumes. They are called Janjevci, derived from the villages the majority are from. Since most are descended from Dubrovnik traders seven centuries back, they have maintained certain elements of Dubrovnik style clothing that is reflected in their national dress. Due to conflicts plaguing Kosovo over the years, many have migrated to Croatia, where a large cultural community has been set up in Zagreb, preserving the songs, dances, and culture of the Janjevci. Croatian girls in folklore costume in Hungary Croatian minorities in nearby countries such as Hungary, Romania, Italy, Montenegro and Austria continue to have their own traditional dress influenced both by their ancestor's original costume and adaptation of certain local regional styles. In Hungary, the native Croats often participate in cultural festivities wearing their national costumes, which have been heavily influence by Hungarian style with elaborate colors and rich material. In Austria, the Croatian Cultural Association helps maintain the culture of the local Croats by sponsoring local kolo, where traditional costumes from Nikitsch show the German and Austrian Alpine influence.

Namoratunga means \\"people of stone\\" in the Turkana language. The site was originally believed to have been created around 300 BC, but recent excavations have yielded an older radiocarbon sample dating to 2398 +/- 44 years BC. Background The site is easily visible on the Lodwar ‚Äì Kalokol roadside, from the road. The Kalokol Pillar Site contains 19 basalt pillars which are surrounded by a circular formation of stones. A number of other pillar sites surround Lake Turkana as well and date to the same time period; Lothagam North and Manemanya, for example, are communal cemeteries. These sites were likely built by the region's earliest herders. Another burial site with stone cairns, Namoratunga I, also known as Lokori, does not have stone pillars. Archaeologists Mark Lynch and L.H. Robbins described the Kalokol Pillar Site in 1978 and identified it as a possible archaeoastronomical site. Lynch believed the basalt pillars tie the constellations or stars to the 12-month 354-day lunar calendar of Cushitic speakers of southern Ethiopia. The pillars were said to align with seven star systems: Triangulum, Pleiades, Bellatrix, Aldebaran, Central Orion, Saiph, and Sirius. Other archaeologists have reanalyzed the archaeoastronomical evidence, and an older radiocarbon date from the Kalokol Pillar Site now calls into question these interpretations.

His great-uncle was Istv√°n Sz√©chenyi. L√°szl√≥ Sz√©chenyi married Gladys Vanderbilt, the youngest daughter of Alice Claypoole Gwynne and Cornelius Vanderbilt II. Early life The Count was born Sz√©chenyi L√°szl√≥ Jen≈ë M√°ria Henrik Simon on February 18, 1879 in Horp√°cs, then a part of Austria-Hungary, a dual monarchy established in 1867. He was a son of Countess Alexandra Sztaray-Szirmay et Nagy-Mih√°ly and Count Imre Sz√©chenyi de S√°rv√°r- fels≈ëvid√©k, the former Austrian Minister at the Court of Berlin. He was the youngest of four brothers, including: Count Dionys, who was Minister of the Austrian Embassy at Paris (he married Comtesse Marie de Caraman et Chimay), Peter Sz√©chenyi, and Istv√°n Sz√©chenyi. All of the brothers were Reserve Lieutenants in the Imperial Hussars as well as Chamberlains at the Court. His father owned thousands of acres divided into scores of farms and forest preserves on which the Sz√©chenyis grew wheat, Turkish pepper, tobacco, hemp, and grapes. Career His wife, Count Sz√©chenyi, and Alice Roosevelt Longworth at the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial, 1922. Count Sz√©chenyi was the inventor of the submarine wireless telegraphy, for sending and receiving sound-wave vibrations underwater. The machine was successfully tested with then U.S. Secretary of the Navy George von Lengerke Meyer, in Newport, Rhode Island. Sz√©chenyi, along with David C. Watts, formed the Submarine Wireless Company to produce it. By 1908, Count L√°szl√≥ Sz√©chenyi de S√°rv√°r-fels≈ëvid√©k was the most prominent member of his family, which was quite numerous. He possessed two great estates in Hungary, Oermezo Castle, which is about three hundred years old and 4,000 acres, in the County of Templen, and Lagoshara Pusbla, a Summer place of about 4,300 acres, in the County of Somogy. The Count also owned a one-story, ten room house at 14 Eotvoss-street in Budapest. Shortly before the War, Count L√°szl√≥ Sz√©chenyi de S√°rv√°r-fels≈ëvid√©k tried to become a financial Napol√©on in Hungary and met his Waterloo very quickly. He is said to have lost $4,000,000 which is supposed to have come largely from his wife. He was a member of the ‚ÄòMagnates Group‚Äô which speculated in mines, railroads and other enterprises. They failed to calculate the impact of the World War, and suffered a complete smash as a result of the fall in value of their shares. Diplomatic career The Kingdom of Hungary and the United States signed a treaty establishing friendly relations on August 29, 1921. On January 11, 1922, Count L√°szl√≥ Sz√©chenyi presented his credentials as Hungary's first Minister to the United States. He served in that role until March 31, 1933. He was transferred to the same post at the Court of Saint James in England in 1933. Personal life Portrait of his wife, Gladys Vanderbilt, two years before their marriage, by John Singer Sargent, 1906.

Gladys grew up in the family home on Fifth Avenue in New York City, and their summer \\"cottage,\\" The Breakers in Newport, Rhode Island. They married on January 27, 1908, at her family home in New York City, after their meeting in Berlin near her twenty-first birthday in 1907.

With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored.

Their four daughters were Margaret (Mrs. J. Fogarty); Kathleen (Mrs. R.A. Strang); Jean (Mrs. J. Wallace); and Patricia (Mrs. P. Steeles). (Death Notice: ANDERSON, Sarah Ann, The Sydney Morning Herald, (Wednesday 15 February 1950), p.30.) He moved to Wagga Wagga from Melbourne in 1919. Football Anderson played on the half-back flank for most of his career at Collingwood. He was recruited from the Howlong Football Club in 1911; and, when he first came to Collingwood he was known as \\"Snowy Martin\\", due to his similarity to an Essendon player of the same name.This \\"Snowy Martin\\" was not Ernest \\"Snowy\\" Martin, who shared a birthday with Anderson; because, in May 1911, Ernest \\"Snowy\\" Martin was just 8 years old.Club Notes, The Argus, (Friday, 26 May 1911), p.4. He was unable to play in the first five matches of the 1911 season because his clearance from the New South Wales league was delayed.The clearance came through on the evening of Friday, 2 June 1911; which allowed him to play, for the first time, on the following day (League Permits, The Argus, (Saturday, 3 June 1911), p.16.). In the meant time, The Argus was reporting that \\"Anderson is showing splendid form at practice\\".Club Notes, The Argus, (Friday, 2 June 1911), p.9. He played his first senior game for Collingwood on his 26th birthday (Saturday, 3 June 1911), against Melbourne in round 6 of the 1911 VFL season on the forward line; he kicked one goal. Noting that he was \\"a player from a rural association\\", the football correspondent of The Age ‚Äî who thought that Collingwood full-forward Dick Lee was quite out of form during the match ‚Äî remarked that \\"in the want of lofty markers in the forward division [for Collingwood]‚Ä¶ Anderson was the most proficient in this department\\" and, further, asserting that \\"[Anderson will undoubtedly prove to be a valuable acquisition to his team\\".The Football Season: Matches for Premiership: League Matches: Collingwood (6.13) Beat Melbourne (5.13), The Age, (Monday, 3 June 1911), p.10.

Smith also approached the Australasian Football Council, which gave him permission to take two teams to the Exposition. By the second half of the year, Smith had formed a company known as The Australian Football Company. The company representatives met with Frederick William Hagelthorn (1864‚Äì1943), who was not only the Victorian Minister for Public Works, but was the Victorian Commissioner to the Panama Exposition; they sought a \\"small subsidy\\" towards their expenses, whilst at the Exposition, on the basis that \\"the men would serve as an admirable advertisement for Australia\\". Hagelthorn's response was that, whilst their endeavour \\"had his hearty sympathy\\", he was unable to grant their request. He promised, however, to see if it was possible to subsidize local advertising for the exhibition games.Australian Football: Proposed World Tour: Visit to Panama Exposition, (Thursday, 23 July 1914), p.6. Anderson was one of the first players chosen for the exhibition teams; however, due to the commencement of the first World War, all of Smith's plans were abandoned, and the proposed exhibition matches never eventuated.Memorial plaque, 1987.

It was built for James Alldis, supervisor at the firm, and a leading citizen of Torrington. The house was built in 1895 and retains most of its original features, including the hardwood floors, most of the original lighting fixtures and door hardware, and the original hot air heat distribution system. and It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Carriage house The property includes a second contributing building, which is a carriage house. The house's \\"irregular plan and massing\\", its round tower with conical roof, and its \\"elaborate porch of sawn and turned woodwork\\", and \\"intricacy of detail\\" elsewhere are all characteristic of Queen Anne style exteriors. Besides variety in massing, variety is also expressed in a wide variety of window designs and surface textures. The first floor exterior is straight-lined, composed of narrow smooth clapboards; the exterior of the second floor and above is textured and wavy in its edges. The house's interior is also Queen Anne style overall in that it includes classical detail work (of a variety of named styles), and it also is very well preserved. Interior details include a tiled fireplace. The house has two colored-glass windows, one believed to be from Tiffany Studios and one from Bigelow Studios. James Alldis James Alldis (1839‚Äì1910) was a leading citizen. English-born, he immigrated to the U.S. at age 14. He was supervisor of the Excelsior Needle Company, a needle manufacturing firm which became the Torrington Company, and which was the largest employer in Torrington. He worked there from 1869 to 1899, when he retired. He was a \\"principal shareholder\\" in the Torrington and Winsted Street Railway and served as its president from 1899 to 1906, when it was sold to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. He was a Democrat in a Republican town. He purchased the property to have this substantial house built in 1895. Recent use In 1895, the house's location was in a \\"fine residential neighborhood\\" although very close to the downtown business area. Currently there is a church and other institutional buildings on the same block, and the Alldis House and at least one other house have been adapted for non- residential use. The house now houses a law firm on two floors and an apartment above.

Founded by Charles Eddy, the EP&NE; was the primary railroad in a system organized under the New Mexico Railway and Coal Company (NMRy&CCo;), a holding company which owned several other railroads and also owned mining and industrial properties served by the lines. The EP&NE; first connected El Paso with Alamogordo, New Mexico, in 1897, further extensions allowed for tourist excursions to the Sacramento Mountains and some timber extraction. A link with the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (CRI&P;) allowed for the introduction of the Golden State Limited in 1902. When a line connecting to lucrative coalfields was secured, the holding company and its system were folded into the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad, an affiliate of the predecessor of the Phelps Dodge Corporation. The lines of the NMRy&CCo; were responsible for the founding of several settlements in the Territory of New Mexico (later New Mexico). History The railroad's beginnings lie in the discovery of gold at White Oaks, New Mexico in 1879, at which point railroads began to gain interest in the Tularosa Basin and Sacramento Mountains. The coal deposits in the area were also enticing as they were perceived to be a good source of fuel for the city of El Paso to the south. An interested railroad promoter, Morris Locke, noted that the forests of the Sacramento Mountains would be a good source of timber. Over the next fifteen years several railroads were projected to link the two settlements but only limited construction had been pursued by the time Charles Eddy developed an interest in linking El Paso with the CRI&P.; Eddy kept his interests somewhat quiet and El Pasoans hopefully speculated that the CRI&P; might build its own line to El Paso. El Paso‚ÄìAlamogordo The first serious attempt to build a railroad north from El Paso and into the Tularosa Basin came in 1885 when the El Paso, St. Louis and Chicago Railway and Telegraph Company prepared a long roadbed. In 1888 CRI&P; engineers began an eastward survey from Liberal, Kansas that projected never built lines through the Maxwell Land Grant to Taos, New Mexico and further west. Meanwhile, some of the partially prepared right-of-way in El Paso was incorporated three years later into the promising Kansas City, El Paso and Mexico Railroad (KCEP&M;, led by Morris Locke) which built of track and graded a further 21 before its debt caught up to it. Construction began in September 1888 with loans from local entrepreneurs and some word of financial commitment from interests in the American Northeast. Just a few days after the first excursion trains operated on the new line, lawsuits were filed in court seeking restitution for the Texas and Pacific Railway, the unpaid shipper of the KCEP&M;'s construction materials. Although the founders continued to solicit funding, in 1892 the Texas and Pacific purchased the stalled KCEP&M.; The new owners did not resume construction. Eddy had been in contact with the leadership of the CRI&P; but had been unsuccessful in his pitch to connect their railroad to El Paso. Eddy had gained an interest in the prospective region after working on engineering projects in southeastern New Mexico. In the Spring of 1897 he led potential investors from Pennsylvania on a camping trip in the Tularosa Basin. Eddy received financial backing from these men but he did immediately not make any major announcements, file for incorporation in the territory or apply for the El Paso‚ÄìWhite Oaks railway franchise. In May 1897 on the other side of the country in New Jersey the New Mexico Railway and Coal Company was incorporated, it would become the holding company for Eddy and his group's vertically integrated interests. When another group of men sought the necessary franchise from the El Paso city council, Eddy intervened and won the franchise because of the rival group's inability to pay a performance bond. A few days later (on October 22, 1897) the El Paso and Northeastern Railroad was incorporated in both New Mexico and Texas. By November 1897 the railroad's first line's route had been determined and orders for supplies were being placed. Using part of the KCEP&M;'s grade, which Eddy had purchased in full, the EP&NE; completed an line north to a ranch owned by Eddy, where a town was being platted in anticipation of the railroad. The town was named Alamogordo after a location Eddy was familiar with in the Pecos River Valley. It would become the main New Mexican town on the EP&NE; in only a matter of a few years. Alamogordo remained the operational base of the EP&NE; system for much of its history. Expansion and affiliated lines the New Mexico Railway and Coal Company's 1903 network and connecting lines Not long after connecting Alamogordo to El Paso, Eddy, his chief engineer Horace Sumner and their crews set about building the Alamogordo and Sacramento Mountain Railway (A&SM;). Described as an \\"engineering marvel\\", were completed by 1898. By 1903 the line climbed over crossing several large trestles and a switchback with ruling grades of 6.4 %. From the outside world it provided improved connections to rich timber country, and later the resort at Cloudcroft‚Äîin addition to small communities like La Luz and Russia. The logs harvested in the mountains provided the Alamogordo Lumber Company (owned by the NMRy&CCo;) with many of the raw materials necessary to make the ties, poles and structures for the EP&NE;'s northward expansion. While work to the east was also under way the EP&NE; under its own name was extended further north to Carrizozo, near White Oaks. In 1899 the EP&NE; opened a extension from Carrizozo to Capitan. With an operational railroad in place extending north-by-northeast from El Paso, Eddy was able to better gain the attentions of the CRI&P; leadership. It was agreed in December 1900 that Eddy's railroad was to meet the CRI&P; in Santa Rosa, New Mexico. The El Paso and Rock Island Railway (EP&RI;) was incorporated in 1900 by Eddy to build the remaining between Santa Rosa and Carrizozo. A tightly-controlled multinational workforce was brought in to expedite construction of the line. This effort was completed on February 1, 1902 when the EP&RI; met the CRI&P;, operating under the name Chicago, Rock Island and El Paso Railway while in New Mexico. It marked the opening of a new transcontinental route that gave the CRI&P; \\"the shortest line from Chicago and Kansas City to El Paso and Mexico, and by way of the Southern Pacific to Los Angeles.\\" The coal deposits near White Oaks proved to be a disappointment. Eddy was still determined to link his railroad system to a mineral rich area so he hedged, on the advice of his trusted attorney William Ashton Hawkins, that the outcome of litigation about the ownership of part of the Maxwell Land Grant in northeastern New Mexico would favor the current tenant, an elderly rancher named John Dawson, and Hawkins secured the eventual purchase of a parcel of the contested land grant from him. The approximately parcel was rich in bituminous coal, and Eddy co-founded the Dawson Fuel Company in 1901 to buy and mine the parcel. Work on the Dawson Railway began at a crossing of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (AT&SF;) at French (near present-day Springer). A second construction gang worked north from Tucumcari. The first section of the Dawson Railway opened in November 1902 and linked the interchange with the AT&SF;'s transcontinental line to the coal mines, sawmills and coke ovens being built near the future townsite of Dawson, New Mexico. Construction of the southern section of the Dawson Railway, from a bridge over the AT&SF; line to a junction at Six Shooter Siding (later Tucumcari, located east-by-northeast of Santa Rosa) with the CRI&P; was held up due to litigation with the owners of the Pablo Montoya Grant over the proposed right-of-way. The outcome of those proceedings allowed for the completion of the originally projected Dawson Railway in 1903. Sale to the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad and Phelps Dodge James Douglas, a representative and co-owner of the growing Phelps Dodge mining corporation who was also the owner of the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad (EP&SW;), entered negotiations with Eddy over the sale of the NMRy&CCo;, the holding company for Eddy's rail and coal properties in the territory and Texas. Eddy was able to convince Phelps Dodge that Dawson coal was better for coking than the coal Phelps Dodge was interested in extracting from northwestern New Mexico so on July 1, 1905 Eddy's properties were transferred to Phelps Dodge, the rail line from El Paso to Dawson becoming the Eastern Division of the EP&SW.; The A&SM; continued to operate for some time as a subsidiary of the EP&SW.; Infrastructure, operations and services The Mexican Canyon Trestle near Cloudcroft Trips to the cool mountain resort of Cloudcroft (elevation ) were a favorite retreat for El Pasoans around the turn of the century. Since the line's opening, Summer excursion trains were operated into the Sacramento Mountains east of Alamogordo via the A&SM; from El Paso, and under new ownership as late as 1930. The EP&SW; continued to encourage tourism on the A&SM; line describing Cloudcroft as the \\"Roof Garden of the Sky\\" or \\"Nature's Roof Garden\\" and building its own hotel, the Lodge. The A&SM; itself became a tourist attraction. The same features that gave the line into the Sacramento Mountains its scenic virtue and tourist draw also made it expensive to build, operate and maintain; by necessity and design hauling timber was the primary activity on the line. The Alamogordo Lumber Company was NMRy&CCo;'s logging enterprise and owned the logging railways, short spurs and branches, that first harvested the territory's trust land in the Sacramento Mountains. The logging lines were temporary constructions, sometimes little more than tracks laid in the dirt, and initially relied on animal labor. The A&SM; carried the lumber company's logs to its sawmill in Alamogordo for processing. While the best consumers for the mill's output were the NMRy&CCo;'s interests, lumber was also shipped out on the EP&NE; destined for other markets, especially the mining districts at Bisbee and Morenci, Arizona. Over the course of one month in 1901 the A&SM; handled 850 log cars. Traffic on the A&SM; line was not restricted to passengers and logs, a wide variety of other cargo was hauled including express, goods, machinery, produce, and livestock. Two daily roundtrips, one a mixed train, were common, though this frequency could increase more than twofold on Summer weekends. Passenger traffic on the Cloudcroft branch ceased in March 1937, having been overtaken by automobiles on improved highways. By late 1944, freight traffic had dwindled to a single round trip weekly, also due to highway traffic. All service was discontinued in the autumn of 1947, and the tracks taken up.\\"SP Abandons Cloudcroft Branch,\\" Trains magazine, February 1948 Some of the large trestles remain, still maintained as historic structures. The railroad founders were also eager to found a major town that would persist after the railroad was completed; they formed the Alamogordo Improvement Company to develop the area, making Alamogordo an early example of a planned community. The Alamogordo Improvement Company owned all the land, platted the streets, built the first houses and commercial buildings, donated land for a college, and placed a restrictive covenant on each deed prohibiting the manufacture, distribution, or sale of intoxicating liquor. Through Eddy's Dawson Fuel Company, the NMRy&CCo; helped spur the early development of Dawson, which is now deserted, in the form of one-hundred dwellings for its workers, in addition to industrial facilities. The premier long distance train service on the joint EP&NE; system was the Winter only Golden State Limited. Year round passenger service was provided by the westbound Chicago and Mexico Express and the eastbound Chicago Express. All of these Chicago‚ÄìLos Angeles trains used the EP&NE; system as an intermediate link between the CRI&P; at Santa Rosa and the Southern Pacific Railroad in El Paso. Following the sale of the NMRy&CCo;, the EP&SW; obtained a lease of the Santa Rosa‚ÄìTucumcari section of the El Paso‚ÄìChicago route (called the 'Golden State Route') to avoid unsatisfactory interline service with the Rock Island system on the Eastern Division between Dawson and El Paso. Another operational hurdle of the original EP&NE; was also solved after the sale; Hawkins was able to secure legal rights to cleaner water from the mountains. Previously the system had relied on alkali and gypsum rich well water that damaged the steam engines' boilers and necessitated frequent repairs.

I Still Love You, released on May 26, 2015, and Always and Forever, Lara Jean, released on May 2, 2017. A film adaptation of the book was released on Netflix in 2018. Its plot is similar to the original book with a few changes. Plot Lara Jean Song Covey is a sixteen-year-old half-Korean, half-white girl living in Virginia. She is extremely close to her older sister Margot and younger sister Kitty. Lara Jean keeps love letters to all the boys she has ever loved in a teal hatbox given to her by her late mother who died by a head injury when Lara Jean was just 9. Just before Margot leaves for university in Scotland, she breaks up with her boyfriend Josh Sanderson, who is also their next-door neighbor and Lara Jean's friend. Lara Jean, who once had a crush on Josh, finds her feelings for him coming back after Margot leaves for school, and Josh admits during a conversation about crushes that his first serious crush was on Lara Jean. To cope with her feelings, Lara Jean writes a long postscript for the letter she wrote when she was fourteen, after Josh asked Margot out instead of her. Peter Kavinsky, one of the guys Lara Jean wrote a letter to, approaches her and tells her he does not have any sort of attraction to her. Lara Jean is confused, but realizes that he is referring to a letter she wrote him years ago after he received it in the mail. Horrified, she tells him she wrote it a long time ago. Lara Jean recounts what prompted her to write the letter: when she was in seventh grade, she and Peter were with a group of mutual friends when Peter kissed her. Lara Jean cannot find her hatbox at home. That night, she hears Josh come over and hides in a treehouse she used to spend a lot of time as a kid. The next morning at school, Josh asks her about the letter to him. She lies and says she no longer has feelings for him and that she is dating someone else. When he asks who it is, she says Peter as he's the first person she thinks of while he walks down the hallway. Lara Jean spontaneously jumps onto Peter and kisses him in front of Josh, and Peter kisses her back. At school, Lara Jean explains her situation to Peter, who decides to go along with the lie, as he has just broken up with his long-term girlfriend Genevieve (who is also Lara Jean‚Äôs enemy) and wants a clean break. Lara Jean and Peter set up a list of ground- rules on how to act around each other. The more time they spend together, the more confused Lara Jean gets about her feelings. As Lara Jean and Peter begin to genuinely fall for each other, Josh becomes jealous of Peter, and when Lara Jean confronts him about it, he kisses her and tells her he wants to be with her, which makes Lara Jean realize that she no longer likes Josh and that she wants to date Peter for real. On a school ski trip, Peter tells Lara Jean he does want to date her and they kiss in a hot tub. The following day, Genevieve tells her that there is a rumor that the two had sex in the hot tub, and Peter did not deny it. Humiliated, Lara Jean avoids Peter during Christmas break. Kitty invites him over to the Covey's recital party, which they had every year before their mother died. When Peter tries to talk to Lara Jean, Josh steps in to try and protect her, and Margot ends up hearing about how Josh and Lara Jean kissed. Margot and Lara Jean eventually reconcile, but Lara Jean remains angry at Peter until Kitty admits that she stole her sister's hatbox and mailed the letters to try and get back at Lara Jean for almost revealing Kitty's crush on Josh. Lara Jean forgives Kitty. Kitty tells Lara Jean that Peter really cares for her and returns the hatbox that is now filled with notes that Peter gave Lara Jean while they were fake-dating. Reading them over, Lara Jean has a change of heart and takes out her pen and paper to write a real love letter to Peter. Reception The novel spent 40 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list in the Young Adult fiction section. It has been published in 30 languages. Film adaptation In June 2014, it was reported that Overbrook Entertainment, actor Will Smith's production company, had secured the film rights to the novel, with Annie Neal hired to adapt the book for the screen. Smith and Overbrook's James Lassiter produced. Carrie Pilby director Susan Johnson directed the film, from a screenplay by Sofia Alvarez, with Lana Condor, Janel Parrish, Anna Cathcart, Noah Centineo, Israel Broussard, and John Corbett starring. Production began in Vancouver in July 2017, and the film was released by Netflix on August 17, 2018. The film received positive reviews.

The character was created by Peter B. Gillis and Brent Anderson. Publication history Toxyn was created by writer Peter B. Gillis and artist Brent Anderson. She made her first cameo appearance, standing in the shadows, in the finale of Strikeforce: Morituri #5 (April 1987). She made her first full appearance in issue #6 and joined the Strikeforce: Morituri in issue #8, as part of the second-generation Morituri. She was a regular cast member until her death in issue #21. Judging from her surname and her relation to a man named \\"Nikos\\", the character appears to be at least partially of Greek origin. Fictional character biography In 2073, Ruth Mastorakis was an ordinary young woman, about to marry her boyfriend, a man named Nikos. For reasons unrevealed, Nikos professed he could not and should not marry her, later claiming that \\"you know what I am. I can't marry you!\\" Furthermore, Nikos beat and humiliated her in front of everybody. Devastated after her breakup, Ruth sought something entirely different in her life. Possibly out of desperation, she decided to enlist to the Morituri program, which granted superhuman powers to its recipients, in exchange of their participating in the ongoing war against the destructive alien race known as the Horde. However, the process has a fatal side-effect: the recipient dies within a year of receiving it, after catastrophically rejecting it. Ruth was genetically compatible for the process and underwent, eventually developing the ability to analyze the biochemistry of others and synthesize poisons and their antidotes that could accordingly tackle her opponents. The nature of her powers also led her into assuming the codename \\"Toxyn\\".Strikeforce: Morituri #6 Sometime later, Toxyn, together with Scaredycat and Scatterbrain, officially debuted in the media as the second generation of Morituri and met with their veteran teammates. Subsequently, Toxyn had her first official mission with the team, in San Francisco. During the course of that mission, senior member Radian, looking for a leader figure after the demise of group leader, Vyking, mistook Toxyn's self-confidence for experience and pressured her into making battle decisions, until she discouraged him from further pressing her into this position. Nevertheless, Toxyn's contribution to that battle was instrumental.Strikeforce: Morituri #8 Later, having watched her achievements through the media, her ex-boyfriend, Nikos, contacted her, wishing to congratulate her. Toxyn was startled and angry that he considered congratulating her, after what he had done to her. Around the same time, the Morituri stood accused by the ruling Paedia Council of breaking regulations and going against the Horde without authorization on a particular occasion. While speaking with a Paedia official, an indignant Toxyn kissed all her teammates and secreted a deadly poison on their lips, wanting to demonstrate to her superiors the desperation the Morituri feel for every moment they are being unfairly kept away from active duty, given the short time they have left on Earth. The Council was convinced by her point and no reprimands were issued. Toxyn then administered the antidote to all her teammates.Strikeforce: Morituri #14 Death Toxyn went through many adventures with the team and eventually found herself the most veteran member of the team still active and alive (with the exception of comatose Scatterbrain). While raiding a Horde ship in orbit, the team rescued a Paedia soldier, Jason Edwards, who had been kept slave by the Horde. Jason and Toxyn flirted and when they returned to Earth, they kissed and agreed to arrange a date. Toxyn was then taken away on an ambulance by paramedics, having sustained a leg injury during the battle. However, just then, the deadly Morituri effect caught up with her and she pushed the paramedics away, proclaiming her love towards Jason. She then pushed the ambulance into a warehouse, where she exploded into oblivion without being seen.Strikeforce: Morituri #21 Powers and abilities Toxyn had the ability to analyze a person's biochemistry, through physical touch, and synthesize and secrete the whole spectrum of poisons, including their antidotes. She could produce both beneficial and harmful biochemical agents that affected both living and inanimate matter, although she needed skin-to-skin contact to produce a species specific toxin. Toxyn often kissed her opponents in battle, thus ensuring the effectiveness of her poisons, often paralyzing or instantly killing her adversaries. As a by-product of her exposure to the Morituri program, she also had enhanced strength and resilience. Like all other team members, she also wore special boots which enabled her to fly.

Developed in 2010 by physicists as the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, the clock was 37 times more precise than the then-existing international standard. The quantum logic clock is based on an aluminium spectroscopy ion with a logic atom. Both the aluminum-based quantum clock and the mercury-based optical atomic clock track time by the ion vibration at an optical frequency using a UV laser, that is 100,000 times higher than the microwave frequencies used in NIST-F1 and other similar time standards around the world. Quantum clocks like this are able to be far more precise than microwave standards.  Accuracy  A NIST 2010 quantum logic clock based on a single aluminum ion The NIST team are not able to measure clock ticks per second because the definition of a second is based on the NIST-F1 which cannot measure a more precise machine. However the aluminum ion clock's measured frequency to the current standard is 1121015393207857.4(7)Hz. NIST have attributed the clock's accuracy to the fact that it is insensitive to background magnetic and electric fields, and unaffected by temperature. In March 2008, physicists at NIST described an experimental quantum logic clock based on individual ions of beryllium and aluminum. This clock was compared to NIST's mercury ion clock. These were the most accurate clocks that had been constructed, with neither clock gaining nor losing time at a rate that would exceed a second in over a billion years. In February 2010, NIST physicists described a second, enhanced version of the quantum logic clock based on individual ions of magnesium and aluminium. Considered the world's most precise clock in 2010 with a fractional frequency inaccuracy of , it offers more than twice the precision of the original.NIST's Second 'Quantum Logic Clock' Based on Aluminum Ion is Now World's Most Precise Clock, NIST, 4 February 2010 In terms of standard deviation, the quantum logic clock deviates one second every 3.68 billion () years, while the then current international standard NIST-F1 Caesium fountain atomic clock uncertainty was about 3.1 √ó 10‚àí16 expected to neither gain nor lose a second in more than 100 million () years. In July 2019, NIST scientists demonstrated such a clock with total uncertainty of (deviates one second every 33.7 billion years), which is the first demonstration of a clock with uncertainty below .  Gravitational time dilation in everyday lab scale  In 2010 an experiment placed two aluminum-ion quantum clocks close to each other, but with the second elevated compared to the first, making the gravitational time dilation effect visible in everyday lab scales. More accurate experimental clocks The accuracy of quantum clocks was briefly superseded by optical lattice clocks based on strontium-87 and ytterbium-171 until 2019. An experimental optical lattice clock was described in a 2014 Nature paper. In 2015 JILA evaluated the absolute frequency uncertainty of their latest strontium-87 optical lattice clock at , which corresponds to a measurable gravitational time dilation for an elevation change of on planet Earth that according to JILA/NIST Fellow Jun Ye is \\"getting really close to being useful for relativistic geodesy\\". At this frequency uncertainty, this JILA optical lattice optical clock is expected to neither gain nor lose a second in more than 15 billion () years.

ISAT is based on multiple linear regressions that are dynamically added as additional information is discovered. The technique is adaptive as it adds new linear regressions dynamically to a store of possible retrieval points. ISAT maintains error control by defining finer granularity in regions of increased nonlinearity. A binary tree search transverses cutting hyper-planes to locate a local linear approximation. ISAT is an alternative to artificial neural networks that is receiving increased attention for desirable characteristics, namely: * scales quadratically with increased dimension * approximates functions with discontinuities * maintains explicit bounds on approximation error * controls local derivatives of the approximating function * delivers new data training without re-optimization ISAT was first proposed by Stephen B. Pope for computational reduction of turbulent combustion simulation and later extended to model predictive control.

Traditional solutions have involved the trapping and removal of all the beavers in an area. While this is sometimes necessary, it is typically a short-lived solution, as beaver populations have made a remarkable comeback in the United States (after near extirpation in the nineteenth century) and rapidly recolonize suitable habitat. In fact, a 2006 survey found that trapping as a solution to beaver problems had a 79% failure rate within two years due to resettlement by new beavers. Flow devices are relatively cost- effective, low-maintenance solutions that regulate the water level of beaver dams and keep culverts open. A 2006 study by the Virginia Department of Transportation found that for every $1 spent on flow-device installation relative to historical preventive maintenance, road repairs, and beaver population control activities, $8 was saved, for a return on investment of nearly 8:1. Benefits of beavers River otter standing on beaver pond flow device in urban Alhambra Creek Re-opening beaver dam to install pipe leveler to regulate height of beaver pond in downtown Martinez, California Beavers faced near extinction from unregulated trapping across North America during the early to mid-nineteenth century. This caused widespread environmental damage including the drying up of many streams and rivers formerly sustained by the high water tables associated with beaver dams. In addition, beavers create wetlands which increase biodiversity and improve water quality by removing sediment and pollutants. In fire-prone areas, beaver ponds serve as fire breaks. Salmon and trout easily cross beaver dams and scientific evidence shows that fish size and fish populations are larger when beaver are present. A keystone species, beavers create habitat for numerous other species, as exemplified by ponds created in Alhambra Creek in Martinez, California, by a new beaver colony in 2007 which colony, in turn, led to the return of numerous birds, steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), river otter (Lontra canadensis) in 2008, and mink (Neovison vison) in 2009. The most common beaver-related flooding issues that people encounter are caused by blocked road culverts or freestanding beaver dams. Beaver-related flooding issues can usually be resolved with properly designed and installed water control devices, also known as flow devices. Flow devices are either specially designed pipes installed through beaver dams, or pipe and/or fence systems that protect road culverts from being blocked. The beneficial effects of beavers on stream flow, riparian habitat, salmon and trout, and wetland creation can be sustained with application of these inexpensive technologies, which require little maintenance. History of flow device solutions to beaver dams In 1952, the concept of installing perforated pipes in dams was introduced to control water levels at the Northeastern Wildlife Conference as a solution for problem beaver ponds. In 1963, Laramie reported that the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department had successfully installed and maintained beaver pipes in 46 dams. In 1978, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation began designing and testing various culvert protection devices, of which the T-culvert guard was the most effective and cost-beneficial. In 1992, Clemson University developed the Clemson Beaver Pond Leveler, a device that prevented beavers from damming areas of concern by directing water through existing dams using a strategically designed pipe system. Over the years, these designs have been modified and improved in order to address flow problems that occur in a variety of different landscapes. The most recent innovations in flow devices combine fencing techniques which exclude beaver with pipe systems which deceive beaver. Contemporary flow devices Before: Culvert fence and pond leveler pipe system installed with beaver pond drained After: Culvert fence and pond leveler pipe after beaver re-build their dam Beaver dam pipes Beavers diligently plug leaks in their dams because their survival depends upon the cover provided by the water in their pond. If a beaver can detect the flow of pond water into a pipe, it will plug the pipe with mud and sticks. To be successful, a beaver dam pipe must eliminate the sound and feel of water flowing into the pipe. Successful pipe designs (e.g. Flexible Pond Leveler, Castor Master, Clemson Pond Leveler) achieve this by protecting the intake end of the pipe with a cylindrical fence enclosure. A beaver swimming along the outside of the fence enclosure is unable to hear or feel the flow of water into the pipe and cannot reach it to block it. The pond level is controlled by the height of the pipe in the dam. Since beavers depend on water for their survival, the more a beaver pond is lowered with a pipe, the more likely it is that the beavers will try to build a new dam to return the water to its previous high level. In addition, the more a beaver pond is lowered, the more valuable wetland acreage is lost. Therefore, it is important to lower a beaver pond only enough to resolve the threat to human health, safety, or property. Culvert protection A culvert pipe under a road is a common target for beaver damming because the constriction speeds up the current and may resemble a hole in a dam. With a little work, a beaver can quickly plug a culvert with mud and sticks, and turn the entire roadbed into a large dam. Highway Departments often spend significant amounts of time and money repeatedly clearing beaver dams from culverts. Culvert protective fences The Beaver Deceiver (a trapezoidal shaped culvert fence) was invented by Skip Lisle in the 1990s while working for the Penobscot Indian Nation in Maine. It is very effective at completely eliminating beaver damming of a culvert. It works in three ways. First, the perimeter of the trapezoidal fence is typically 40 ‚Äì 50 feet long, making it difficult for a beaver to dam the entire fence. Second, as beavers try to dam the culvert, the fence forces them to dam in a direction away from the culvert, which is not in their nature. Third, as they dam farther out on the fence, the opening of the stream into which it flows gets wider. Therefore, the damming stimuli of the sound and feel of moving water decrease the farther they dam on the fence. If the sides of the fence are at least 12 feet long, the beavers will generally leave the fence alone. To be effective, however, a culvert fence must be surrounded by enough water that the beavers will need to dam the entire fence perimeter. In areas where the stream bed is narrow rather than wide, the fence must be narrow so that it is surrounded by water. Being narrow loses one advantage of the trapezoidal shape, but it can still deter beavers from damming the culvert. Since beavers are excellent diggers, a fence floor is usually needed to prevent beaver tunneling under the fence. The fence walls need to be only 24 inches above the water line since beavers do not climb. Fence and pipe culvert system Combining a small culvert Fence with a Pond Leveler Pipe is another effective method to protect culverts from beaver damming. The culvert fence is made small enough to encourage the beavers to dam on it, but the resulting pond is prevented from rising to a dangerous level by a Pond Leveler Pipe installed through the culvert fence. The Fence and Pipe flow device needs very little maintenance and limits where and how high the beavers can dam; however, to be most effective, the intake end of the pipe should usually sit in at least 3 feet of water. When this water depth is not possible, a simple Culvert Protective Fence may be the best option.

On the same date, he inaugurated a local bridge across the Itibou River;Lydie Gis√®le Oko, \\"L'Association convergence pour le Congo participe √† l'implantation d'une chaine de t√©l√©vision √† Mossendjo\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 30 April 2007 . the completion of the bridge, which was needed to facilitate local trade, fulfilled a pledge made by Ngu√©l√© some years before.Jean Dany Ebou√©l√©, \\"Un pont et une piste agricole pour les populations de Mossendjo\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 2 May 2007 . In the June 2007 parliamentary election, Ngu√©l√© ran as an independent candidate in Mossendjo constituency,\\"La liste compl√®te des d√©put√©s\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 11 August 2007 . although he was a member of the ruling Congolese Labour Party (PCT).\\"L√©gislatives au Congo: tension dans une ville en attente des r√©sultats\\", Agence France-Presse, 7 August 2007 . The first round of the election in Mossendjo was held over again in July 2007 due to local difficulties. Ngu√©l√© placed second with 23.30% of the vote, behind Emmanuel Boungouandza, the candidate of the opposition Pan-African Union for Social Democracy (UPADS), who received 34.94%.\\"Premier tour des l√©gislatives, r√©sultat des partielles\\", Congopage website, 23 July 2007 . Because neither of them obtained a first round majority, Ngu√©l√© faced Boungouandza in a second round of voting in August 2007. After the second round, both sides claimed victory as they awaited the publication of results, and police were deployed to deal with the local tensions. Boungouandza claimed to have won by 94 votes, but alleged that some members of the local commission were working separately from the rest in an effort \\"to tilt the results in favor of my opponent\\", and he said that Mossendjo was under a \\"state of siege\\". Ngu√©l√© was subsequently declared the victor,\\"Les r√©sultats des √©lections l√©gislatives, avant l'examen des contentieux √©lectoraux\\", La Semaine Africaine, number 2,720, 21 August 2007, page 7 . credited with a narrow second round majority of 51.91%, but Boungouandza took the matter to the Constitutional Court, arguing that the results should be cancelled; he claimed that the results from three of the 25 polling stations were not included in the total.Roger Ngomb√©, \\"Contentieux √©lectoral : Le verdict est attendu pour demain vendredi 26 octobre\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 25 October 2007 . The Constitutional Court upheld Ngu√©l√©'s victory on 26 October 2007, ruling that Boungouandza did not have enough evidence to warrant the cancellation of the results.Laroche Diaboua, \\"Lamyr Nguele est bel et bien le vainqueur du scrutin du 5 ao√ªt 2007\\", La Semaine Africaine, number 2,740, 30 October 2007, page 3 . On 28-29 August 2008, Ngu√©l√© was present for an operation to demolish homes along a three-mile stretch of the coast at Matombi and evict squatters from the area. The purpose of the demolition project was to clear space for construction of a port for the export of minerals. Ngu√©l√© emphasized that the operation had been explained to residents in advance and denied claims that it was \\"an act of state banditry\\". He said that legal residents of the area would be compensated.\\"D√©molition des habitations des occupants ill√©gaux sur la bande littorale de Matombi dans le d√©partement du Kouilou\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 2 September 2008 .

In the July-August 2012 parliamentary election, Ngu√©l√© sought re-election to the National Assembly as the PCT candidate in Mossendjo, but he was soundly defeated in the second round of voting.

The character was created by Peter B. Gillis and Brent Anderson. Publication history Scaredycat was created by writer Peter B. Gillis and artist Brent Anderson. She had a cameo appearance in Strikeforce: Morituri #5, in the shadows, before making her first full appearance in #6. Subsequently, she joined the cast of Strikeforce: Morituri in #8, up until her death in #19. Notably, her hair was black in her first full appearance, before the artist settled on brown. Fictional character biography Not much is known about Pilar Lisieux, prior to her joining Strikeforce: Morituri. An avid New Age follower, she believed in the existence of spiritual energy in everything and often indulged in meditations, considering herself a mystic. At some point, in 2073, she decided to undergo the Morituri process and assist in the ongoing war of Earth against the formidable alien invaders, known as the Horde. The process was able to grant superhuman abilities to its recipients, proving an invaluable asset in battle. However, it also had a fatal flaw: the recipients of the process could not live more than a year after fully receiving it, because of their organism eventually rejecting the new metabolism inserted in their organism. Having no fear of death, after the guidance she had received from her spiritual guide, Pilar volunteered for the process and after proving genetically compatible for it, underwent it. Eventually, Pilar developed the ability to transmit panic to her opponents, in combination with superhuman speed.Strikeforce: Morituri #6 Pilar was later given the humorous codename \\"Scaredycat\\" by her teammate, Will Deguchi. In retaliation, she gave him the codename \\"Scatterbrain\\", owing for his ability to project unfocused psychological conditions on many people at once. Scaredycat, together with Scatterbrain and Toxyn, soon debuted publicly as the second generation of Morituri and met with their veteran teammates, before participating in their first official mission in San Francisco.Strikeforce: Morituri #8 Later, in the Morituri base, Scaredycat used her terminal to detect any strange messages coming in or out of the base. Soon, she intercepted a communication between the inventor of the Morituri process, Dr. Kimmo Tuolema and a member of the ruling Paedia World Government. Scaredycat was shocked when she realized the official actively discouraged Dr. Tuolema from searching for a cure for the mortal flaw of the Morituri process and instead instructed him to focus his researches on other things. Scaredycat immediately revealed this message to her teammate, Radian.Strikeforce: Morituri #9 Increasingly distrustful of her superiors and feeling that the Morituri were being treated as expendable pawns, Scaredycat later also confided her fears in the rest of the team, informing them of the exchange between Tuolema and his superior.Strikeforce: Morituri #11 Death Despite her suspicions about her superiors, Scaredycat remained on the team. Later, she began flirting with Scatterbrain and provoked him by inviting him to read her thoughts.Strikeforce: Morituri #16 At some point, she finally kissed Scatterbrain and the two began forming a romance. With his clairsentience, Scatterbrain knew she would be the next one to die of the Morituri effect, and informed her of the fact. Scaredycat faced the news quite stoically, stressing that she does not fear anything, including death. Her romance with Scatterbrain was cut short when he slipped into a self-induced coma.Strikeforce: Morituri #18 The team then went on a mission in the Serengeti, in Africa, attacking some Hordians who were slaughtering animals there. Experiencing surges of power, Scaredycat began realizing that her time was up and used her surge to kill the Hordians, before passing away. She was seen in afterlife, being led by another spirit to meet the Morituri that had fallen before her.Strikeforce: Morituri #19 Powers and abilities Scaredycat had the ability to move at superhuman speed, her normal speed being increased by a tenfold, thanks to the Morituri process. She could also project fear, inducing shock and panic to her opponents. This effect did not work on machines.Strikeforce: Morituri #15 Like all recipients of the Morituri process, she also had enhanced strength and resilience. Like all team members, she also donned special boots, which enabled her to fly.

Post-Olympics Maltais found success at the 2012 World Championships. There she won a bronze medal in a photo finish in the 1,000 m. With her success she qualified for the 3,000 m superfinal where she lapped her entire opposition and won the gold medal. Due to her results she also won the silver medal in the overall standings at the competition. In the finals of the relay however, teammate Marie-√àve Drolet fell and put the Canadians in fourth place and Maltais just missed winning a fourth medal at the event. 2014 Sochi Olympics Going into the 2014 Winter Olympics Maltais was no longer a rookie Olympic competitor, though she still found herself as the youngest member of the women's short track team at those games. At the previous games she had not been invited to skate on the relay team and says that she was paralyzed with nerves, whereas going into these games she now found strength in her favour 1,000 and 1,500 m metre events where she liked leading from the front. Maltais talked about her strategy saying that \\"Last year, I spent more time at the front and I think that it's a strategy that works well for me. I have to learn to change my laps and to better control my speed, but I think that this could be a good strategy.\\" This strategy helped her at the national trials and Maltais competed in all three individual events as well as the relay in Sochi. 2018 Winter Olympics In August 2017, Maltais was named to Canada's 2018 Winter Olympics team.

McAlevey is a union organizer, scholar, author, and political commentator. She has contributed to The New York Times, The Nation, Jacobin, In These Times, Catalyst, Politics & Society, AlterNet and other publications. In June 2019, University of California, Berkeley Labor Center announced the appointment of McAlevey as a Senior Policy Fellow. She was also named Strikes correspondent for The Nation magazine. She's written three books about power and strategy and the essential role of workers and trade unions in reversing income inequality and building a stronger democracy: No Shortcuts - Organizing for Power in the New Gilded Age (Oxford University Press, 2016), Raising Expectations and Raising Hell (Verso Books, 2012), and her third book, A Collective Bargain: Unions, Organizing, and the Fight for Democracy, which was published by Ecco Press in January 2020. McAlevey has appeared on numerous television and radio shows as well as podcasts. Early background McAlevey was the youngest of nine children. Her mother died of BRCA#1 breast cancer when she was not yet in kindergarten. Her father was an executive of Rockland County, New York. In high school, she organized student strikes and walk-outs over issues ranging from sexist gym requirements to stopping nuclear energy to the possible reinstatement of the draft. In the spring of 1984, while at the State University of New York at Buffalo, she was elected student body president and ran with a slate of young radicals who swept all student government seats. She went on to be the president of the statewide student union in New York‚Äôs public university system (called the Student Association of the State University of New York (SASU). She orchestrated the takeover of the SUNY state university headquarters, which resulted in the SUNY trustees voting to divest the university system from entities doing business in South Africa. It was the largest act of divestiture by anyone in the USA at that time. Environmental activist to labor union organizer After traveling and working in Central America, McAlevey was recruited to move to California to work out of David Brower‚Äôs new Earth Island Institute on a project aimed at educating the environmental movement in the United States about the ecological consequences of U.S. military and economic policy in Central America. She was co-director of EPOCA, the Environmental Project on Central America, one of Earth Island's projects. After two years working on coalition building in the US and the international environmental movement, she was recruited to work at the Highlander Research and Education Center in New Market, Tennessee, where she helped create a joint program between the Highlander Center and the National Toxics Campaign on globalization. Labor organizer & contract negotiator After the New Voices leadership came to power at the AFL-CIO in 1996, she was recruited by senior AFL-CIO leaders to work for their new organizing department and head up an experimental multi-union campaign in Stamford Connecticut. The Stamford Organizing Project, her first foray into union organizing, developed a model for rank & file worker-based social movement unionism that McAlevey calls the ‚Äúwhole worker organizing approach.‚Äù Rather than unions focusing only on workplace issues, this approach requires equally intense union-based organizing around the many issues afflicting the working class. The key to the method is to deliberately connect workers' non- workplace issues to their relationships in their families and communities. Union members draw on their relationships to their own churches and faith- based institutions, sports clubs, social groups of all kinds, and help carry success on a broad range of issues from the workplace into their own communities and local politics. From the AFL-CIO she was recruited to become the national Deputy Director for Strategic Campaigns of the Health Care Division of the SEIU (2002 to 2004). From there she was hired by SEIU Nevada, a statewide union, as their Executive Director and Chief Negotiator in 2004. From 2004 to 2006, the Nevada local had more hospital organizing wins than any other SEIU local. The Nevada local also reached the highest membership level in a right to work state in the history of the SEIU (more than 70% union wide), leading to unprecedented success in Nevada including achieving fully employer-paid family healthcare, preventing the rollback of public pensions, stopping and in some cases reversing two-tier collective bargaining agreements, and using an approach to contract negotiations that gives every worker the right to sit in on their workplace negotiations. Following her career at SEIU, McAlevey completed a doctorate in sociology at the Graduate Center, CUNY under the supervision of Frances Fox Piven and advised by Dan Clawson.

Based on the novel She Loves Me Not by Edward Hope and the subsequent play by Howard Lindsay, the film is about a cabaret dancer who witnesses a murder and is forced to hide from gangsters by disguising herself as a male Princeton student. Distributed by Paramount Pictures, the film has been remade twice as True to the Army (1942) and as How to Be Very, Very Popular in (1955), the latter starring Betty Grable. The film is notable for containing one of the first major performances of Bing Crosby, and it helped launch him to future stardom. This was also the last film that Miriam Hopkins made under her contract to Paramount Pictures, which began in the early 1930s upon her arrival in Hollywood. In 1935, the film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song for \\"Love in Bloom\\".

B. * Matt McHugh as Andy * Franklyn Cordell as Arkle Reception The film was one of Paramount's biggest hits of the year. Mordaunt Hall, writing in The New York Times, liked it saying, \\"As on the stage, this adaptation is a swift- paced piece of hilarity, with occasional romantic interludes during which Bing Crosby and Kitty Carlisle contribute some tuneful melodies. Some of the farcical episodes in this Paramount offering are apt to recall that famous old comedy, \\"Charley's Aunt\\", but in the present production, instead of having a varsity student in skirts, they dress up a cabaret girl in male attire after she has invaded a dormitory room.\\" Variety had a mixed reaction \\"...But apart from this possible captiousness Par's ‚ÄòShe Loves‚Äô holds plenty for the gate. Crosby is most of it. He looks better than ever (somehow his stature has been built up although the faintest suggestion of embonpoint doesn't quite jell with a Princeton undergrad), but he acts intelligently and sings those tunes. The songs will be no small asset to the film. There are three outstanders, two by Revel and Gordon‚Äî‚ÄòStraight from the Shoulder (Right from the Heart),‚Äô and ‚ÄòI‚Äôm Hummin‚Äô, (I'm Singin‚Äô, I'm Whistlin‚Äô) and one by Robin and Rainger (‚ÄòLove in Bloom‚Äô) ‚Äî and the latter is the smash hit of the flicker and currently Tin Pan Alley's No. 1 song, so it's easy to figure out the b.o. reaction.\\" Songs * \\"Love in Bloom\\" (Leo Robin and Ralph Rainger) ‚Äì sung by Bing Crosby and Kitty Carlisle * \\"After All You're All I'm After\\" (Edward Heyman and Arthur Schwartz) (written for the film but not used) * \\"Straight from the Shoulder\\" (Mack Gordon and Harry Revel) ‚Äì sung by Bing Crosby and Kitty Carlisle * \\"I'm Hummin', I'm Whistlin', I'm Singin'\\" (Mack Gordon and Harry Revel) ‚Äì sung by Bing Crosby. * \\"Put a Little Rhythm in Everything You Do\\" (Mack Gordon and Harry Revel)Burton, Jack.

His name, sometimes spelled Ananjesu or Khnanishu, means 'mercy of Jesus'.  Sources  Brief accounts of Hnanisho's patriarchate are given in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (floruit 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth-century), Amr (fourteenth-century) and Sliba (fourteenth-century).  Hnanisho's patriarchate  The following account of Hnanisho's patriarchate is given by Bar Hebraeus, who was more interested in his influential sponsor Isa the pharmacist than in the patriarch himself: > The catholicus Yaqob died after fulfilling his office for nineteen years, > and was succeeded by Hnanisho II, bishop of Daquqa [Lashom]. He was > consecrated at Seleucia on the recommendation of Isa the pharmacist, and > died after fulfilling his office for four years. It is said of this Isa the > pharmacist that one day while he was sitting in his shop a woman arrived > from the caliph's court with a bottle containing a urine sample. Thinking > that he was a doctor, she showed it to him and asked him whether he could > diagnose the illness suffered by the urine's owner. Isa, who had no > knowledge or experience of the physician‚Äôs art, studied the urine and said, > purely by way of a guess and with downcast eyes, 'This is not the water of a > sick man, but belongs to a woman who carries a male child in her womb who > will one day rule this kingdom.' Now this woman was the maidservant of > Kaizaran, the concubine of the caliph al-Mahdi, and she immediately ran to > her mistress and told her what she had just heard. Her mistress replied, > 'Run back to that man and tell him that if his prophecy comes true, I will > take him into my service and shower wealth upon him.' And so Isa spent all > his time in churches and monasteries, in the company of holy men and > miracle-workers, and in fasting and praying, until his prediction came true. > He was then received with great honour in the caliph's court.Bar Hebraeus, > Ecclesiastical Chronicle (ed. Abeloos and Lamy), ii. 164‚Äì6  Hnanisho and the Nestorian mission to China  Hnanisho is named in both Syriac and Chinese in a conventional dating formula at the end of the main inscription on the Nestorian Stele erected in Ch'angan by the metropolitan Adam of Beth Sinaye (China) in February 781. The Syriac text reads 'In the days of the father of fathers the catholicus-patriarch Mar Hnanisho (b'yawmi aba d'abahatha Mar Hnanisho qatoliqa patrirqis)'. The Chinese text reads 'when the monk Ning-Shu was governing the brilliant congregations of the East'. The news of Hnanisho's death several months earlier had evidently not yet reached the Nestorians of Chang'an.

Career Mammone's research interests lie in computational pattern recognition and signal processing. He performed research on Neural networks and signal processing, generating over 15 patents and producing 150 published papers. Mammone started high-tech companies and serves as consultant to government agencies and industry. As an entrepreneur, his interests lie in the processes involved in creating technology products. In supply chain management, Mammone advocates developing product platforms that can be designed within an existing product‚Äôs value chain. Groundbreaking corneal mapping technology catalyzed his second venture, Computed Anatomy Inc. The firm was first to develop, manufacture and sell computer aided surgery tools for corneal surgery commonly referred to today as LASIK surgery. His software is still used for laser eye surgical procedures. Computed Anatomy was sold in 1986 to a Japanese manufacturer of ophthalmic tools. In 1992, Mammone founded SpeakEZ Inc., a provider of biometric security systems.

In 1994, it was sold to T-Netix (NASDAQ: TNTX), a publicly traded telecommunications company. During his three-year tenure, Mammone rolled out and managed several successful products. At the height of the dot com era in 2000, Mammone launched The mBook Company. The company developed new media alternatives for textbooks and trade books using technology. Although the firm disbanded in 2001 due to investment related issues, it made strides in developing an interactive e-learning platform at a time when high bandwidth video over the internet was unavailable, garnering support from Cisco and other strategic partners. Currently, Mammone serves as the liaison between Rutgers University and Industry by coordinating networking events, web sites and projects that combine business and technology interests. He directs the CAIP center which provides Cyber infrastructure platforms for academic and nonprofit institutions. Mammone's current interests lie in fostering an ecosystem of innovation and new venture development. To that end, he served as the Director of the Business, Engineering, Science, and Technology (BEST) Institute which focuses on starting new companies based on university intellectual property. He is a contributor to Business Week, featuring articles that speak to the challenges faced by entrepreneurs. He is currently involved in launching a start-up, myPowerMap LLC, a firm that specializes in developing home energy consumption monitoring technology.

Located in the eastern part of the town, it is bordered by Balut II to the north, Panilao to the west, Bagumbayan and Landing to the south, and Manila Bay to the east. Majority of Wawa are agricultural lands used as either fishponds or rice paddies. Most of the locals reside in the central portion along the Masuaje River. The barangay's name derives from the Tagalog word wawa, meaning \\"estuary\\" or river mouth owing to its location where the Masuaje River drains to Manila Bay. As of 2015, the local population is around 1,990. Economy Formerly, the barangay's primary source of livelihood was fishing owing to its healthy seas. Fisherfolks usually go to the sea for weeks or even months navigating the whole area of Manila Bay and often reaching as far as Bulacan, Cavite, and Batangas. On their return, the people celebrate as they wait by the sea shore. Today, only a few people depend on fishing, and usually use canoes instead of large barges. Culture The barangay celebrates two festivals, or fiestas, annually: one in May to celebrate the feast of the Holy Cross (Santa Cruz) and the other every October 24 to celebrate the feast of the barangay's patron saint, San Rafael the Archangel. The two fiestas are celebrated differently. The feast of St. Raphael is traditionally celebrated with a festive dance called \\"sambale\\" (also known as \\"karakol\\" in some parts of the Philippines) followed by a fluvial parade starting from the Masuaje River until Manila Bay and back. During the fluvial procession, locals bring the image of Saint Raphael together with a brass band called \\"musico\\" to the sea aboard a large boat (mother \\"pagoda\\") adorned with colorful banderitas. Smaller outrigger boats or bancas follow the mother pagoda. After reaching the open sea, the boats make several rounds that last for hours before heading back to the river. The locals believe the celebration will give them plentiful catch of fish. In May, a \\"kantura\\", a variant of the santacruzan, is held for nine days prior to the feast day. The kantura consists of twelve (sometimes fourteen) young girls between 7 and 12 years old that sing and dance hymns to the Holy Cross every day and night during a procession, symbolizing the role of pilgrims journeying to the Holy Land to visit the Holy Cross. Every night the Holy Cross is transferred to a different house or 'station' and a feast is served for the cantors and the townsfolk, traditionally consisting of green bean soup (nilagang monggo) and paborita. On the ninth and final day, the kantura follows the Reyna Elena on her search for the Holy Cross. A sambale and fluvial parade are also typically held during the day before the night procession.

It was located on the Wairarapa Line between the stations of Mauriceville (to the south) and Eketahuna (to the north) with vehicular access from Station Road. It is the northernmost station site on the Wairarapa Line within the jurisdiction of the Greater Wellington Regional Council before the line passes into territory governed by Horizons Regional Council. The station opened to all traffic in 1887 and was in service for years, closing to general freight traffic in 1966 and three years later to passengers also. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"mƒÅhoe (whiteywood) stream\\" for MangamƒÅhoe.  History   Facilities  Features typical of a small rural railway station were present at Mangamahoe from its early years as official records mention a wooden-fronted passenger platform (1903), goods shed and station building (1905), wooden-fronted loading bank (1924), staff telephone (1929), and Ways and Works Branch shed (1962). A tablet porter's room was located in the station building and water closets were provided for the convenience of staff and passengers. The yard contained, in addition to the main line, crossing loops and a stockyards siding. A request was made in 1958 for the crossing loops to be lifted as they had become surplus to requirements with approval being granted the following year. The Inspector of the Permanent Way advised in June 1959 that trap points had been installed at Mangamahoe and the loop roads closed off. Lifting of the loops was deferred until such time as the track gangs became available and it was intended to move the crossing loop to replace the goods shed road which had been laid with light rails. In 1962 works were undertaken to make the yard fit for the use of Da class locomotives. It was noted that all the tracks remaining in the yard were still required and that both the goods shed and the Way and Works Branch shed had verandas with insufficient clearance for the Da locomotives. As the verandas were no longer required their removal was requested. Commensurate with the size of the station, the staff complement was also small. A new caretaker is mentioned in 1905 and the tablet porter was withdrawn on 7 April 1929. Following the withdrawal of the porter the station was considered to be an unattended flag station though gangers and train crews performing shunting at Mangamahoe continued to make use of the facilities there when in the area.  Services  The first trains to serve Mangamahoe were of the mixed variety, being services that had already been running from Wellington up the Wairarapa Line to Masterton. As the railhead moved further north traffic increased as more communities were served and more primary produce could be railed out. The Wairarapa Line was completed to its ultimate terminus in 1897 which allowed the Railways Department to introduce the Napier Mail train to the Wairarapa Line. This service had been running between Napier and Palmerston North since the line through the Manawatu Gorge had been completed several years earlier. The Napier Mail was the first express passenger service to run regularly on the Wairarapa Line and served the Wairarapa until 1909 when it was diverted to once again run through the Manawatu Gorge and down the North Island Main Trunk to Wellington after the nationalisation of the Wellington and Manawatu Railway the previous year. Thereafter a new express passenger service was introduced to run between Wellington and Woodville, being the Wairarapa Mail, which was essentially the Wellington to Woodville portion of the old Napier Mail. A new passenger service began in 1936 when the Railways Department introduced the Wairarapa railcars, offering passengers from Mangamahoe a faster and more comfortable service both north to Woodville and south to Wellington. The Wairarapa Mail passenger trains continued to run but in 1944 were reduced from their Monday ‚Äì Saturday timetable to a thrice weekly service due to a severe coal shortage. It never recovered from this and was withdrawn completely in 1948. Several years later the Rimutaka Tunnel was opened, bringing an end to the mixed trains that had been plying the Wairarapa Line and the withdrawal of the Wairarapa-type railcars. Thereafter the new twin-set railcars provided the only passenger service to Mangamahoe and remained in service until after Mangamahoe was closed to passenger traffic in 1969. The 1959 railcar timetable lists Mangamahoe as a \\"stops if required\\" station for both northbound and southbound services.  Today  The only remnants of the station still extant at Mangamahoe are the platform and a shelter shed. All sidings and loops have been removed and the yard is overgrown in tall grass. A Track Warrant Control board identifies the site as Mangamahoe.

It was a success in the UK when released largely due to the popularity of the two female stars Hopkins and Lawrence. This also brought to attention the talents of Rex Harrison who made his breakthrough into Hollywood not too long after this film. Gertrude Lawrence, although not so much a movie actress, was at the peak of her stage career when this film was released and her performance was praised. Plot summary In London, critic Mr. Skeates dictates a scathing review of Edmund Davey, the lead actor debuting in the play Othello, to his secretary, Ann Williams. Barbara Albert, Davey's co-star and wife, comes to the newspaper offices to plead her husband's case. Skeates has already left, so she begs Ann for help to save Edmund's career, insisting that he is a great actor who was simply overwhelmed by his great opportunity. Ann is touched and takes a great risk (as Skeates never reads his own work), rewriting the review to praise the actor's performance. The critic, however, finds out when Edmund thanks him for his kind words, and Ann is given the sack. She goes to see the play. She and the rest of the audience are entranced by Edmund's second performance. When Barbara spots her after the show, she introduces Ann to her husband. Ann and Edmund become infatuated with each other, however.

It later spread to cinema also. Art form The roots of Shinpa can be traced to a form of agitation propaganda theater in the 1880s promoted by Liberal Party members Sadanori Sudo and Otojir≈ç Kawakami. Theatre historians have characterized Shinpa as a transitional movement, closely associated with the Meiji restoration, whose primary rationale was the rejection of \\"old\\" values in favor of material that would appeal to a partially westernized urban middle class which still maintained some traditional habits of thought. Some of the innovations associated with Shinpa included: shortened performance times, the occasional re-introduction of female performers to the stage, the abolition of teahouses that had previously controlled ticket sales, the use of contemporary patriotic events as subject matter, and the frequent adaptation of western classics, such as the plays of Shakespeare and The Count of Monte Cristo. It eventually earned the name \\"shinpa\\" (literally meaning \\"new school\\") to contrast it from \\"ky≈´ha\\" (\\"old school\\" or kabuki) due its more contemporary and realistic stories. With the success of the Seibidan troupe, however, shinpa theater ended up with a form that was closer to kabuki than to the later shingeki because of its continued use of onnagata and off-stage music. As a theatrical form, it was most successful in the early 1900s as the works of novelists such as Ky≈çka Izumi, K≈çy≈ç Ozaki, and Roka Tokutomi were adapted for the stage. With the introduction of cinema in Japan, shinpa became one of the first film genres in opposition again to ky≈´ha films, as many films were based on shinpa plays. Spread to cinema Some shinpa stage actors like Masao Inoue were heavily involved in film, and a form called rensageki or literally \\"chain drama\\" appeared which mixed cinema and theater on stage. With the rise of the reformist Pure Film Movement in the 1910s, which strongly criticized shinpa films for their melodramatic tales of women suffering from the strictures of class and social prejudice, films about contemporary subjects eventually were called gendaigeki in opposition to jidaigeki by the 1920s, even though shinpa stories continued to be made into film for decades to come. On the stage, shinpa was no longer as successful after the Taish≈ç era, but good playwrights such as Matsutar≈ç Kawaguchi, actresses like Yaeko Mizutani and such Living National Treasures as Rokur≈ç Kitamura and Sh≈çtar≈ç Hanayagi helped keep the form alive. Shinpa also had an influence on modern Korean theater through the shinp‚Äôa (Ïã†Ìåå) genre.

The set was released and is available through Mountain Retreat, a label run by Newbury and later Newbury's family. While Newbury had an impressive reputation as an artist and songwriter, at the time of the set's release in 1998, these recordings had been out of print for years. The original master tapes were lost by the labels, and so the recordings on the collection are digital transfers from virgin vinyl copies. The packaging replicates the original album art. The collection includes the albums Looks Like Rain (1969), Frisco Mabel Joy (1971), Heaven Help The Child (1973), Live At Montezuma Hall (1973), I Came to Hear the Music (1974), and Lovers (1975) on individual discs, as well as Rusty Tracks (1977), and His Eye Is on the Sparrow (1978), The Sailor (1979) and After All These Years (1981) on two combined discs. Newbury created a remarkable body of work, and while he is often classified as a country artist, the breadth of his artistic reach includes blues, soul, folk, rock, and traditional styles. Newbury frequently includes suites such as \\"Wrote A Song A Song/Angeline,\\" \\"The Sailor/Song of Sorrow/Let's Say Goodbye One More Time,\\" and the epic, and oft-covered \\"An American Trilogy\\" which combines \\"Dixie,\\" \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic,\\" and \\"All My Trials,\\" and includes production effects such as rain, wind chimes, and strings.

Chess engines that continue calculating even when it is not their turn to play end up choosing moves that are stronger than if they are barred from calculating on their opponent's turn.  Use with chess programs  The strength of chess programs depends very much on the amount of time allocated for calculating. Many chess programs use pondering to improve their strength. Current programs cannot create strategic plans, so a program simply tries to predict the opponent's move and begins to calculate its response. If the opponent's move has been guessed correctly, then the program continues to calculate. If the prediction fails, the program begins a new computation. Pondering is less effective than normal thinking. For example, if the program guesses 25% of the opponent's moves correctly, the use of pondering is on average equivalent to increasing the normal calculating time by a factor of 1.25. In chess games between two computers, pondering makes sense only if the competing chess engines use separate processors or cores. If they share the same core, the pondering program steals half of the time from the program thinking in the normal way and uses the stolen time less effectively. For this reason, chess GUIs have an option to turn the permanent brain off.

Blystone and starring Miriam Hopkins and Joel McCrea. Plot B.J. Nolan tries to get his millionaire son Kenneth to invest $100,000 in a housing development called Nolan Heights. However, B.J. has a long history of backing crazy projects (which is why his wife left all her money to her son in her will), so Kenneth turns him down. Architect Virginia Travis, unaware that B.J. has no money and is besieged by process servers, tries to get him to hire her. After B.J. breaks the news to her, she faints, having not eaten in 49 hours. He takes her back to his mansion. When she learns that B.J.'s son is wealthy, she decides to use her wiles to extract the money they need from him, aided by B.J. and her married friends Judy and Hunk. The latter two masquerade as B.J.'s servants (B.J. had to let his old servants go as he could not pay them) when Kenneth returns from a cruise with his girlfriend Nina and her \\"uncle\\" Henri. Nina is in fact a golddigger after Kenneth's money, while Henri is her secret lover. Virginia first concocts a scheme to have Kenneth sign five checks for household expenses at once using a mechanical device, one of B.J.'s many failures. Kenneth signs without noticing that one check is for $100,000, but when Virginia and B.J. go to the bank, Mr. Judd informs them that Kenneth has to authorize any check over $1000. Defeated, they return home. Meanwhile, Nina plots to get Kenneth drunk, so he will propose to her. Virginia has the same general idea. After a few drinks, she and Kenneth discover they like the same things and eventually begin kissing, prompting Virginia to have second thoughts about her scheme. She then passes out from drinking too much. Kenneth carries her off to deposit her in her bed, past a fuming Nina. Shortly afterward, B.J. wakes her up and cajoles her into trying again for the money while his son is still somewhat drunk. She goes to Kenneth's room, but when Nina makes an appearance, hides in a tree outside his window. Her dressing gown gets caught in a branch. Kenneth comes out to free her. He finds the contract B.J. had drawn up and is eager to sign it. Virginia tries to stop him by dousing him with a bucket of water that B.J. had brought. Even in his now sober state and with Virginia confessing all, he still wants to finance the project. He then embraces her.

But tragedy struck in 1881, when the typhoid epidemic that engulfed Britain claimed Jabez and his two sons. The company would have collapsed but it was rescued by Jabez‚Äôs wife, Mary, and his daughter, who kept the business going. In 1882, Mary remarried, to Frederick Joseph Tibbits, a skilled bridlemaker, so the company could now produce saddles and bridles. Their only son, Jabez Cliff Tibbits, joined the company in 1902. Jabez Cliff Tibbits sought to expand the company and put in a bid for the prominent saddlemakers, J A Barnsby & Son, and the offer was accepted. This was made all the easier by the close proximity of the Barnsby works, so the two companies could amalgamate without difficulty. The incorporation resulted in the ‚ÄòCliff-Barnsby‚Äô brand name ‚Äì Barnsby making saddles, while high quality bridles were manufactured under the Cliff name. Jabez‚Äô business judgement was put to the test in the run-up to the First World War. The company‚Äôs main export markets were Germany and Russia, but the political climate of the time made these untenable. Alternative areas for profit had to be found, and Jabez decided to diversify into other products, such as sports equipment, bags, travel goods and leather cases. The company patented a new non-tear football which was used in four FA Cup Finals, and even in the 1928 Olympic Games. During the Second World War the company began making military equipment such as gun pouches and webbing. The connection with the military continued into subsequent conflicts. During the Falklands War, the military found themselves in a difficult position as the terrain was hazardous for motor transport. They were forced to rely on mules to move men and equipment, and turned to Barnsby to urgently make the necessary tack. Jabez, who had become managing director in the 1920s, was knighted in 1948 by George VI, and was later elected Mayor of Walsall. He then became an Alderman of Walsall, and died in 1974. On 17 June 2014, it was reported that Barnsby had ceased trading due to a failed restructure and had gone into administration.

Illumination (e≈°rƒÅq) can be translated as \\"the Rising of the Sun.\\" While the 1258 Mongol Sacking of Baghdad and subsequent invasion effectively ended the Islamic Golden Age, it also paved the way for new ideas like illuminationist philosophy.

He developed a version of illuminationism (Persian ÿ≠ŸÉŸÖÿ™ ÿßÿ¥ÿ±ÿßŸÇ hikmat-i ishrƒÅq, Arabic: ÿ≠ŸÉŸÖÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿ¥ÿ±ÿßŸÇ ·∏•ikmat al-ishrƒÅq).

Omega Publications, New York. 1994. . Avicennism (Ibn Sina‚Äôs early Islamic philosophy), Neoplatonic thought (modified by Ibn Sina), and the original ideas of Suhrawardi. None of Suhrawardi's works was translated into Latin, so he remained unknown in the Latin West, although his work continued to be studied in the Islamic East.Marcotte, Roxanne, \\"Suhrawardi\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2019 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). According to Hosein Nasr, Suhrawardi was unknown to the west until he was translated to western languages by contemporary thinkers such as Henry Corbin, and he remains largely unknown even in countries within the Islamic world. Suhrawardi tried to present a new perspective on questions like those of existence. He not only caused peripatetic philosophers to confront such new questions, but also gave new life to the body of philosophy after Avicenna. According to John Walbridge, Suhrawardi's critiques of Peripatetic philosophy could be counted as an important turning point for his successors. Although Suhravardi was first a pioneer of Peripatetic philosophy, he later became a Platonist following a mystical experience. He is also counted as one who revived the ancient wisdom in Persia by his philosophy of illumination. His followers, such as Shahrzouri and Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi tried to continue the way of their teacher. Suhrewardi makes a distinction between two approaches in the philosophy of illumination: one approach is discursive and another is intuitive. Illuminationist thinkers in the School of Isfahan played a significant role in revitalizing academic life in the Safavid Empire under Shah Abbas I. (1588-1629) Avicennan thought continued to inform philosophy during the reign of the Safavid Empire. Illuminationism was taught in Safavid Madrasas (Place of Study) established by pious shahs.  Early modern illuminationism  Mulla Sadra (·π¢adr ad-Dƒ´n Mu·∏•ammad Shƒ´rƒÅzƒ´) was a 17th century Iranian philosopher was considered a master of illuminationism. He wrote a book titled al-Asfar meaning \\"The Yellow\\" or \\"The Light.\\" The word Asfar also denotes a journey of the soul back to Allah. He developed his book into an entire School of Thought, he did not refer to al-Asfar as a philosophy but as \\"wisdom.\\" Sadra taught how one could be illuminated or given wisdom until becoming a sage. Al-Asfar was one piece of illuminationism which is still an active part of Islamic philosophy today. Al-Asfar was representative of Mulla Sadra's entire philosophical worldview.Like many important Arabian works it is difficult for the western world to understand because it has not been translated into English. Mulla Sadra eventually became the most significant teacher at the religious school known as Madrasa-yi(Royal School.) His philosophies are still taught throughout the Islamic East and South Asia.  Key concepts  In his Philosophy of Illumination, Suhrawardi argued that light operates at all levels and hierarchies of reality (PI, 97.7-98.11). Light produces immaterial and substantial lights, including immaterial intellects (angels), human and animal souls, and even 'dusky substances', such as bodies.Philosophy of Illumination 77.1-78.9 Suhrawardi's metaphysics is based on two principles. The first is a form of the principle of sufficient reason. The second principle is Aristotle's principle that an actual infinity is impossible.Philosophy of Illumination 87.1-89.8  Illuminationism in books  Al-Asfar is Mulla Sadra's book explaining his view of illuminationism. He views problems starting with a Peripatetic sketch. This Aristotelian style of teaching is reminiscent of Islamic Golden Age Philosopher Avicenna. Mulla Sadra often refers to the Qur'an when dealing with philosophical problems. He even quotes Qur'anic verses while explaining philosophy. He wrote exegeses of the Qur'an such as his explanation of Al-Kursi. Asfar means journey. In al- Asfar you are gaining on a journey to gain wisdom. Mulla Sadra used philosophy as a set spiritual exercises to become more wise. Eventually this as you go through life you continue to gain more knowledge until you become a sage, hence godlike. In Mulla Sadra's book The Transcendent Philosophy of the Four Journeys of the Intellect he describes the four journeys of # A journey from creation to the Truth or Creator # A journey from the Truth to the Truth # A journey that stands in relation to the first journey because it is from the Truth to creation with the Truth # A journey that stands in relation to the second journey because it is from the Truth to the creation.

The main science goals are to understand (A) how and where tidal heat is generated inside Io, (B) how tidal heat is transported to the surface, and (C) how Io is evolving. These results are expected to have direct implications for the thermal history of Europa and Ganymede as well as provide insights into other tidally heated worlds such as Titan and Enceladus. The IVO data may also improve our understanding of magma oceans and thus the early evolution of the Earth and Moon. IVO is similar to the Io Orbiter concept suggested for the New Frontiers Program by the 2013-2022 U. S.

IVO was also proposed to NASA's Discovery & Scout Mission Capability Expansion (DSMCE) in 2007 and awarded a concept-study in 2009. In 2020, IVO was selected along with three other Discovery proposals for further study, with one or two expected to be selected to fly. In all cases the Principal Investigator has been Alfred McEwen. Mission profile Jupiter, Io, and Europa by Voyager 1 The proposed baseline launch would allow a MEGA (Mars-Earth Gravity Assist) trajectory, using a gravity assist at both Mars and Earth to reach Jupiter near the end of 2031. Following a flyby of Io on its way in, the Io Volcano Observer would execute a Jupiter orbital insertion burn to go into an inclined orbit around Jupiter. During the remainder of the primary mission, IVO would encounter Io nine times over four years. During each of these encounters, the spacecraft would approach Io from over its north polar region, make its closest approach to Io near its equator at an altitude between 200 and 500 kilometers, and leave Io over its south polar region. The time and location of closest approach are carefully optimized to obtain the clearest observations of Io's induced magnetic field, libration amplitude, and gravity field. Erupting volcanoes will be observed in sunlight and in darkness to best constrain the lava compositions. The distribution of heat emanating from Io will be measured from polar perspectives that were not seen by the Galileo spacecraft and cannot be observed from Earth. IVO will also sample the complex mix of ionized and neutral molecules of plasma and gas around Io. The spacecraft is being designed to survive the primary mission with ample margin which could allow various types of extended missions. Current status Io Volcano Observer (IVO) was proposed to the NASA Discovery Program for a third time in July 2019 and was selected for further study in February 2020.\\"Follow the Heat: Io Volcano Observer\\". AS McEwen, E Turtle, L Kestay, K Khurana, J Westlake, etal. EPSC Abstracts Vol. 13, EPSC-DPS2019-996-1, 2019 EPSC-DPS Joint Meeting 2019. Science Jupiter's moon Io The current hyperactive geology of Io is of great scientific interest in of itself but IVO seeks to understand fundamental processes that have implications far beyond this very unusual moon. The theme connecting the diverse science to be done at Io is \\"Follow the Heat.\\" There is a continuing debate about where the tidal heat is produced within Io with some observations suggesting that it is primarily in the shallow mantle while others suggest that the heating is broadly distributed. It is also unclear how much of the heating is from deforming solid rock versus pushing liquid magma around. There is evidence suggesting that there is a global layer of melt (sometimes called a magma ocean) under Io's frozen crust but there are also reasons why such a layer of melt cannot persist. IVO uses four independent experiments to determine if a magma ocean exists and, if it does exist, measure its basic properties. Magma oceans are thought to have been common in the earliest history of most of the bodies in the inner Solar System so IVO may have the opportunity to investigate a key process that died about 4 billion years ago everywhere else in our solar system. It is also conceivable that some of the lessons learned about magma oceans may also be a applicable to oceans of water within tidally heated icy moons of the outer solar system. For example, the way Io loses its internal heat is very different from how the Earth and other rocky planets lose heat at this time. Io appears to lose almost all its heat via a \\"heat pipe\\" process where volcanic eruptions that cover about 1% of the surface of the body. On Earth, plate tectonics mixes large slabs of cold oceanic crust into the warm mantle. On the Moon and Mars, most of the current heat loss is by conduction through the crust. By examining how the cold 99% of Io's crust is involved in the heat pipe tectonics, IVO may have a window into how the early Earth, Moon, and Mars operated. Follow the heat beyond Io bring IVO science to consider the effect tides have on the orbit of Io and the volcanic pollution it spreads across the Jovian system. Io, Europa and Ganymede have their tidal evolution locked to each other via the Laplace resonance, so the system is well-understood only if one combines measurements of all three moons. IVO, Europa Clipper, and JUICE would do precisely this. The tons of volcanic gasses stripped from Io every second is spread widely by Jupiter's powerful magnetic field. IVO will fly through this material providing new insight into how this material is removed and where it goes. This is the first step in understanding how the chemistry of Io has been altered from its initial state and may provide useful clues to how atmospheres on other bodies have evolved over time. Overall, the IVO intends to use Io as a planet-sized natural laboratory to better understand processes that are important across the Solar System and even affect exoplanets.  Science objectives  The science objectives of this proposed mission are: *Determine the degree and distribution of melt in Io's mantle *Determine Io's lithospheric structure *Determine where and how Io is losing heat *Measure Io's orbital evolution *Determine the current rate of volatile loss from Io Scientific payload IVO's highly capable science payload is all based on instruments that have been developed for other missions. *Narrow-Angle Camera (NAC): 10 Œºrad/pixel CMOS detector, pushbroom color imaging in 12 bandpasses from 350‚Äì1050 nm, panchromatic framing images for movies and geodesy.

The record is noted for Newbury's stunning interpretations of four traditional songs, \\"Shenandoah\\", \\"That Lucky Old Sun\\", \\"Danny Boy\\", and \\"In The Pines\\". Rusty Tracks was collected for CD issue on the eight-disc Mickey Newbury Collection from Mountain Retreat, Newbury's own label in the mid-1990s, along with nine other Newbury albums from 1969‚Äì1981. Background By 1976, after a string of stellar but commercially unsuccessful albums, Newbury and Elektra Records parted ways. As Thom Jurek notes in his AllMusic review of Newbury's 1975 LP Lovers, \\"As solid as Lovers is, it still failed to ignite on the chart level. It was greeted with indifference by radio and, hence, Elektra - which had believed and invested in Newbury's creative vision and proven credibility as a songwriter - let him go.\\" Newbury biographer Joe Ziemer sums up the singer's dilemma in his book Crystal and Stone: \\"Though diversity derives from aptitude and ability, diversity was Newbury's problem with radio stations. One dominant characteristic of his music is eclecticism, and that's what made his albums unattractive to strict radio formats.\\" Newbury had made several high profile appearances to promote Lovers, including on the Tonight Show, but began to sour on touring, telling Rich Wiseman of Rolling Stone in 1975, \\"I'll probably quit performing and just record on an album-to- album basis. I'm hating what I'm doing now.\\" In 1977 he elaborated to the Omaha Review, \\"I worked a few concerts, mostly college concerts, just to prove to Elektra that it wouldn't help. They kept blaming the lack of sales on me.\\" Ironically, Newbury's profile could not have been higher on the radio in 1977, albeit in a reverential way; in April outlaw country superstar Waylon Jennings released the #1 country smash \\"Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)\\", which contains the lines \\"Between Hank Williams' pain songs, Newbury's train songs...\\" The song became an instant classic but most of the listeners who sang along with the tune likely had no idea who Newbury was. Although cited by Jennings, Kris Kristofferson, David Allan Coe, and several other country stars as a primary influence on their songwriting and albums, Newbury had little interest in cashing in on the outlaw country movement; according to Ziemer, Newbury was pressured by his record company to record an album called Newbury's Train Songs but Newbury turned them down: \\"They couldn't understand why I refused to do it. But I figured what little audience I did have would have immediately seen it for what it was: Jumping on the bandwagon when I didn't fit the mold.\\" Recording and composition Newbury had started recording songs for what would become Rusty Tracks with Bobby Bare producing while he was still with Elektra but, after signing with ABC Hickory Records, he took those tracks with him (ABC also secured the rights to all of Newbury's Elektra masters). He continued working on the album with producer Ronnie Gant and a legion of Nashville's best musicians. Rusty Tracks was far more rooted in country music than Newbury's previous albums I Came to Hear the Music and Lovers had been, and he continued to explore the darker side of the human experience in his songs, as is evident in the LP's opening track \\"Leaving Kentucky\\". Newbury, who battled depression in his life, later reflected, \\"How many people have listened to my songs and thought, 'He must have a bottle of whiskey in one hand and a pistol in the opther.' Well, I don't. I write my sadness.\\" \\"Makes Me Wonder If I Ever Said Goodbye\\" and \\"Hand Me Another One of Those\\" both address the classic country theme of getting plastered and drowning sorrows (\\"Pour some whiskey on my flame and burn another memory\\") while \\"People Are Talking\\" appears to reflect Newbury's growing disenchantment with the music business and play up to his reputation as a hermit. Rather than throw his lot in with the outlaw movement, Rusty Tracks saw Newbury radically rework several Americana classics like \\"In the Pines\\" and \\"Shenandoah\\" with such emotive phrasing and powerful singing that he \\"made the songs his own.\\" Reminiscent of his early masterpiece \\"An American Trilogy\\", Newbury seamlessly weaves together a quartet of songs that brought the LP to a dazzling conclusion. In its review of the album, AllMusic states: > He doesn't merely sing these songs - he is them, a part and parcel of the > fabric of the notes themselves and what they represent. Just when Americans > were trying to forget who they were by embracing European disco and punk > rock as well as dumbed-down versions of both country and jazz, Newbury > reveals - much to his own commercial detriment - who and what we are as a > nation. Unlike Newbury's earlier Elektra albums, which featured a small group of top Nashville session players, Rusty Tracks includes contributions from a host of musicians and singers, including keyboardist Bobby Emmons (who co-wrote \\"Luckenback, Texas\\"), steel guitarist Buddy Emmons, guitarist Reggie Young, and budding country stars Janie Fricke and Larry Gatlin. Reception Like most of the albums Newbury released, Rusty Tracks did not chart. \\"Hand Me Another One of Those\\" was released as a single and peaked at #94 on the Billboard country chart. Biographer Joe Ziemer writes, \\"The songs carry on with perceptive lyrics, masterly delivered in memorable melodies.\\" AllMusic: \\"This concentration on one music and its classic themes and rougher-edged production proved to be as great as anything he had done since his early records.\\" Track listing All tracks composed by Mickey Newbury; except where indicated #\\"Leavin' Kentucky\\" - 3:50 #\\"Makes Me Wonder If I Ever Said Goodbye\\" - 2:43 #\\"Bless Us All\\" - 2:27 #\\"Hand Me Another Of Those\\" (Mickey Newbury, Lee Fry) - 1:55 #\\"People Are Talking\\" - 2:54 #\\"Tell Him Boys\\" - 2:27 #\\"Shenandoah\\" (Traditional) - 3:36 #\\"That Lucky Old Sun (Just Rolls Around Heaven All Day)\\" (Haven Gillespie, Harry Beasley Smith) - 2:26 #\\"Danny Boy\\" (Frederic Weatherly) - 4:39 #\\"In the Pines\\" (Traditional) - 4:05 Personnel *Guitar and vocals - Mickey Newbury *Guitar - Billy Sanford, Bobby Thompson, David Kirby, Johnny Christopher, Phil Baugh, Reggie Young *Steel guitar - Buddy Emmons, Lloyd Green *Bass - Henry Strzelecki, Joe Allen, Norbert Putnam *Keyboards - Alan Moore, Bobby Emmons, Bobby Wood, Ron Oates *Fiddle - Buddy Spicher *Drums - Farrell Morris, Hayward Bishop, Jimmy Isbell, Larrie Londin *Harmonica - Terry McMillan *Harp - Cindy Reynolds *French horn - Everhard Ramm *Background vocals - Alan Moore, Bergen White, Bobby Hardin, Buzz Cason, Don Gant, Duane West, Janie Frick, Larry Gatlin, Lea Jane Berinati, Rita Figlio, Suzie Calloway, Tom Brannon, Yvonne Hodges *Strings - Ann Migliore, Christian Teal, David Vanderkooi, Gary Vanosdale, John Catchings, Kathryn Plummer, Marilyn Kay Smith, Pam Sixfin, Steven Smith, Wilfred Lehmen *Conductor & Arranger - Alan Moore References ;Citations ;Bibliography  Category:Mickey Newbury albums Category:1977 albums ","title":"Rusty Tracks"},{"id":"26117758","text":"Lovers is the 1975 album by singer-songwriter Mickey Newbury.

Chet Atkins played guitar on \\"Apples Dipped in Candy\\" and Bergen White arranged the strings on the album. Lovers was collected for CD issue on the eight-disc Mickey Newbury Collection from Mountain Retreat, Newbury's own label in the mid-1990s, along with nine other Newbury albums from 1969-1981. Recording and composition The period leading up to the recording of Lovers was not a good one for Newbury; his father had suffered a stroke, he had endured painful back surgery and had been hospitalized for pneumonia, and he was drinking heavily. AllMusic's Tom Jurek, who compares the album to Frank Sinatra's In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning, writes, \\"It's as if he's trying, through hard country, blues, gospel, R&B;, lounge jazz, folk balladry, and even rock, to plead, beg, borrow, and scheme his way (apparently unsuccessfully) from under the bleak cloud that surrounds him.\\" The album was produced by Chip Young, who had helmed Newbury's previous release I Came to Hear the Music, and was recorded at Youngun Sound Studios in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Although primarily recognized as a country singer and songwriter, Newbury stocked Lovers with a plethora of musical styles, including blues (\\"You've Always Got the Blues\\"), gospel (\\"Lead On\\") and heartfelt balladry (\\"Lovers\\", \\"Goodnight\\"). The title track's evocative line, \\"To think they once tore down a wall for a door\\" was inspired, by songwriter Hank Cochran, who lived in an adjoining apartment to country singer Jeannie Seely and, having grown tired of going into the hall to knock on her door, cut a hole through the wall with a chainsaw. Newbury continued to mine new territory, especially for country music, by including a drum solo on \\"Let Me Sleep.\\" In his Omaha Rainbow interview, Newbury stated that \\"Apples Dipped in Candy \\"was a reminiscent kind of thing, going into those kind of songs you hear on the riverboats. Kind of a blues, New Orleans feel.\\" The album marked the end of Newbury's remarkable artistic run with Elektra. Peter Blackstock of No Depression proclaims the early seventies \\"was a fertile time for budding songwriters, and Newbury was the best.\\" Reception Lovers peaked at #172 on the Billboard albums chart.

The text of the treaty sets out boundary in the Strait of Otranto composed of 16 straight-line maritime segments defined by 17 individual coordinate points. The boundary represents an approximate equidistant line between Italy and Albania. The northernmost point of the boundary forms a maritime tripoint with Montenegro; the southernmost point forms a maritime tripoint with Greece. The treaty is unique among maritime boundary treaties in that it allows any dispute regarding the boundary to be referred by either of the countries to the International Court of Justice if it cannot be resolved by diplomatic means within four months.Charney, Jonathan I. et al.

It is best known for its style of adjustable wrench.  History  The Crescent Tool Company was founded in Jamestown, New York, by Karl Peterson and Edward J. Worcester in 1907. It is considered \\"one of the crown jewels of Jamestown's industry\\". The company soon became known for its adjustable wrenches. On his famous 1927 solo flight across the Atlantic, Charles Lindbergh said that he took only \\"gasoline, sandwiches, a bottle of water, and a Crescent wrench and pliers\\". There was a rumor that Richard Evelyn Byrd, on his initial journey to Alaska, had a Crescent wrench in his provisions. The Crescent Tool Company was acquired by a group of investors in 1960 after Marvin Peterson, Karl's son, sold it. The company was renamed the Crescent Niagara Corporation. In 1968, Crescent Niagara was acquired by Cooper Industries. In 2010, the tool divisions of Cooper Industries and Danaher Corporation formed a joint venture, Apex Tool Group, LLC.

History The Island was named by the Chevalier du Roslan in 1771 after his ship Marie Louise. Since the end of the 19th century, the island has been leased and inhabited without interruption. In 1905, the population numbered 86. There was an export of 3500 tons of guano that year. Guano had been the main economy until 1963, when still 3000 tons were produced. Additional products were copra and dried fish. In the 1980s there have been attempts in developing the island into a tourist destination. Some bungalows were constructed. The attempts failed because of air traffic limitations due to the large number of seabirds. Additionally, aircraft landing is difficult, because of the steep coast that is littered with rocks. In 2012 the government established a new prison on the island.State report 2012New prison costs, September 2012October 2012July 2013Prison, June 2014August 2014 Geography Marie Louise Island, with an area of 55.6 ha, is located at the southern end of the Amirantes 13 km from its nearest neighbor, Desnoeufs Island. The island is a low and sandy coral cay, roughly oval in shape, and has a maximum elevation of 9 m. More than half of the island, in the northwestern part, is cultivated with coconut palms. There is a coral reef on the east side of the island which breaks. Landing by boat is difficult. Demographics It is permanently inhabited with a population of about 11.Info on population 6 are IDC staff members, 1 is a medic person for the island, and there is one remaining family at the original village. The villagers are agricultural workers and beach fishermen and are based in a small settlement on the north-west coast above the beach and opposite the only safe anchorage. There are also 98 inmates in the state prison guarded by 3 Seychelles officers, and 30 gurkha security guards.June 2014February 2015 With a population of 142 as of February 2015, this made Marie Louise Island the most populated of the Amirantes at that time.

Administration The island belongs to Outer Islands District.District map Being an island with a small population, there are not any government buildings or services. For many services, people have to go to Victoria, which is a difficult task. Transport The island is bisected by a unpaved airstrip (ICAO code FSMA) that follows the north‚Äìsouth axis. currently there are no regular air services.Flight company Economics The inhabitants on the island are engaged in very small scale farming and fishing which are mainly for the island consumption. Flora and fauna The vegetation is dominated by coconut-palms and Casuarina equisetifolia trees. It is used as a support base for the harvesting of sooty tern eggs on neighboring Desnoeufs Island during the nesting season from June to August. Marie Louise has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports breeding colonies of brown (2000 pairs) and lesser noddies (3500 pairs), and white terns (3000 pairs). Green and hawksbill sea turtles also nest there. Fauna of the islandIDC site The island is known for its rich fish life.

The text of the treaty sets out a complex boundary in the Strait of Sicily representing an equidistant line between Sicily and Tunisia, with the exception of Pantelleria and the Pelagie Islands (Lampedusa, Linosa and Lampione) treated as Italian exclaves in the Tunisian side with specific arcs of territorial sea. The boundary terminates just short of an equidistant line between Malta and the Italian Pelagie Islands and the westernmost point of the boundary line forms a maritime tripoint with Algeria.Charney, Jonathan I. et al. (2005). International Maritime Boundaries, p. 2863. On 23 January 1975, the countries by agreement added supplemental minutes to the treaty, including a map of the boundary and 32 individual coordinate points that define it. It came into force on 6 December 1978 after it was ratified by both countries. The treaty was signed in Tunis on 20 August 1971 and its full name is the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Tunisia and the Government of the Italian Republic concerning the Delimitation of the Continental Shelf between the two Countries.

History At the end of the 1970s, the Swiss watch industry was being affected by the Quartz crisis, and Japanese watchmakers supplied the world market with large quantities of quartz watches. Rolex decided to put forward a new line of watches to combat this situation, and the Datejust Oysterquartz was born. Although not designed to turn the company‚Äôs tradition of producing mechanical watches upside down, it faced the international, namely Asian, markets seeking to keep alive interest in Swiss luxury watchmaking; an industry that seemed at that moment to have been completely absorbed by the Japanese quartz watch. The conception of the Datejust Oysterquartz dates to the beginning of the 1970s. The design of the watch is far removed from the classic Rolex line and carved characteristics of the period: a completely angular case, an integrated band with a polished finish and sapphire glass. Regarding the materials used to make this watch, the whole range consisted of three versions: gold, steel with white gold bezel and steel and yellow gold. At the start, the Datejust Oysterquartz was somewhat overlooked in Europe; however, it was much sought after on the Asian and American markets. A renewed interest in the watch was sparked when Rolex decided to take the Oysterquartz out of its catalogue and thus out of production. The era of the Rolex quartz watch ended in 2001, having lasted less than three decades. The Rolex Datejust Oysterquartz began to appear in the most important auction houses‚Äô catalogues, becoming a highly valued object on the collector's market.

Sir William Curtis (25 January 1752 ‚Äì 18 January 1829) was an English businessman, banker and politician. Although he had a long political and business career (the two significantly intertwined), he was probably best known for the banquets he hosted. Life Born in Wapping, London, Curtis was the son of a sea biscuit manufacturer, Joseph Curtis, and his wife Mary Tennant. The family business was making ship's biscuit and other dry provisions for the Royal Navy. They were also shipowners whose vessels carried convicts to Australia and engaged in South Sea whaling.Jane M. Clayton & Charles A. Clayton, Shipowners investing in the South Sea whale fishery from Britain; 1775 to 1815, Hassobury, 2016, p.89. A lifelong Tory, he was elected as a Member of Parliament for the City of London at the 1790 general election. He held the seat continuously for 28 years until his defeat at the 1818 general election. He was returned to the Commons in February 1819 at a by- election for Bletchingley,Stooks Smith, page 545 and at the 1820 general election he was returned again for the City of London. He did not contest London again at the 1826 election, when he was returned for Hastings.Stooks Smith, page 338 He resigned that seat later the same year. Curtis was also Alderman of the city, becoming Sheriff of London in 1788 and Lord Mayor in 1795‚Äì96. He was known for the lavish banquets he gave at his estate, Cullands Grove. He was created a Baronet of Cullonds Grove in 1802. Memorial to Sir William Curtis in St George's Church, Ramsgate, Kent Curtis died in 1829.

It was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Miriam Hopkins was loaned out to MGM for the picture while under contract to Paramount. Plot Miriam Hopkins plays Louise Storr, a recently divorced New Yorker who travels west to Iowa to visit her paternal grandfather, a relation she has never met. Grandpa Storr (Lionel Barrymore) an 85-year-old patriarch, presides over his large farm and its employees. A number of distant relatives are long time residents in his household. They receive the city-girl granddaughter with reserved solicitude. Miriam meets the owner of the adjoining property, the married farmer Guy Crane (Franchot Tone), an Eastern-educated Iowan she finds attractive. Grandfather Storr's unconcealed preference for his close blood-kin Louise creates tension in the household. She is tested by the resident relatives and farm hands in her performance of her duties on the spread. Her essential good sense and self-esteem serve her well, despite her urban upbringing. Grandpa Storr, a military veteran of the Civil War, begins to display signs of dementia and the coterie of resident relatives quickly call for a mental evaluation to deem him legally unfit to operate the farm. The old man's apparent decent into madness is only a clever ruse to expose their avarice. He alters his will to disinherit the scheming relations and bequeaths the farm to Louise‚Äîthe medical examiners acting as witnesses. His ultimate task in life completed, he dies peacefully.

Location The Monastery in 2009 The monastery is in the Nishava river gorge in the most western part of Bulgaria. It is situated close to the Razboishte village, Sofia Province, at about 10 km to the west of the town of Godech. The village can be reached by car through the roads from the towns of Dragoman or Godech, but the monastery buildings are accessible by car only by a dirt road, when the land is dry, from Kalotina and Cheparlintsi village. Most visitors prefer to walk about a kilometer from the village of Razboishte. History The oldest piece of information about Razboishte Monastery dates as far back as the 4th century A.D. The rock caves around were populated by monks-hermits during the Middle Ages. The caves were also been used as a shelter by St. Sava. According to legend, the Long Lent find the Saint here in the course of his journey to Jerusalem so he stayed for 40 days. During the 18th century the monastery itself came into existence. A small single-nave church was built outside the walls into the nearby rocks just above the Nishava river. The cook-house was added in 1861. It is known that the buildings were set on fire three times by Ottoman conquerors. The Bulgarian revolutionary Vasil Levski stayed at the monastery several times. Nowadays In the beginning of 20th century Razboishte Monastery became desolated until 1947 when three nuns settled here. They found the buildings in decay and the priceless frescoes in the old church almost completely destroyed. In the course of time the nuns, with the help from the local people, succeeded in restoring the Monastery and reconstructing the church. The new chancel-screen is from 1950, but the remnants from the old one are kept in the monastery. There are some old frescoes preserved on the west facade of the initial church. The last of the nuns died in 2007.

He was one of only four clowns ever to have been given the title \\"Master Clown\\" by the Ringling organization. Early life Born in 1925 in Genoa, Nebraska to Elsie and Glen Little. Little saw his first circus at the age of seven, which instilled a lifelong love of the circus in him. His nickname \\"Frosty\\" was given to him as a boy by his grandfather, who compared him to Jack Frost due to his love of playing in the snow. Little used the pseudonym extensively, even signing his checks \\"Frosty Little\\". Little served in the US Navy during World War II, and was wounded. He learned juggling from a fellow patient while convalescing, a skill that would later help him land his first clowning jobs. In 1971, he married his wife, Patricia, a photographer and former schoolteacher, with whom he had two daughters. He had an additional daughter by a prior marriage. Early career Prior to joining the Ringling outfit, Little worked as a postal employee and land surveyor in Colorado. From 1954 to 1956, he performed as a clown at a local amusement park on weekends, wearing a rented costume. In 1956, he went into clowning full- time after he was hired by the Joe King Circus, with which he toured the Rocky Mountain States for half of the year. The rest of the year, he freelanced as a clown at birthday parties and special events. He continued working for the Joe King circus for seven years until its closure in 1962. With Ringling Brothers Little also worked for other small outfits like the Tom Mix Show and Sells Floto Circus, but he had long had his eye on \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" - Ringling Bros. In 1968, he finally got his chance when Ringling Bros. created the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Clown College; Little was in its first graduating class, and at the age of 44, he landed a job with Ringling's newly split-off second touring unit.\\"Clowning Around\\". Sarasota Herald-Tribune, October 27, 1979. In 1970 Little was promoted to \\"Boss Clown\\" of his unit, and from 1980 until his retirement in 1991, he was the circus' \\"Executive Clown Director\\", overseeing clowns in both units, and writing new gags for the clowns to perform. In his lifetime, he wrote over 300 gag routines. In his later career, Little also served as an advance man for the circus. From 1980 until its closure in 1997, Little also taught at his alma mater, the Ringling Brothers clown college. In 1988, Little also helped establish the Ringling circus' first overseas touring unit (based in Japan), choreographing gags and training members of their clown staff. Among the dignitaries he entertained were US Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and US President Richard Nixon. He also appeared on 12 Ringling Bros. TV specials. Little sustained several injuries over the course of his career, including seven broken ribs, ruined knees, and numerous other injuries that left him with \\"crooked fingers\\". After one accident, he was rushed to the hospital (after completing his performance) still wearing his clown suit. Honors In 1983, Little was named \\"Master Clown\\" by the Ringling organization, only the fourth clown ever to be so named (after Otto Griebling, Bobby Kaye, and Lou Jacobs - Little's mentor).Clown Has 'Mastered' Comedy at Ringling\\". Sarasota Herald-Tribune. April 22, 1983.

In 1977 Little was asked by the Sarasota Herald-Tribune what he would do after he retired from the circus. Little replied, \\"Leave here? Are you out of your mind? I'm never going to leave here. I'll always be a clown.\\" On October 26, 2010, Little died in Kimberly, Idaho at age 84. He was survived by his wife Patricia.

Ambassadorship  In the summer of 1970, Belyakov was transferred as ambassador to Finland. His designation as ambassador was mainly because Moscow was interested in increasing the influence of the Finnish Communist Party in Finland. Belyakov mainly created relationships with the Finnish Communist Party's far left Stalinist wing and became its spiritual leader. Belyakov's rival counselor Viktor Vladimirov estimated that in Finland there would be some kind of revolution and he supported it by sympathizing with the strikes and writing articles in Pravda about what he perceived were Finland's \\"class exploitation\\". Another political idea of Belyakov was to encourage the Finnish Communist Party not to accept any Comprehensive Income Policy Agreements. President Urho Kekkonen invited the counselor Vladimirov to his official residence and reproached him about Belyakov. Vladimirov sent a telegram to Moscow and criticized Belyakov's actions in Finland. Kremlin responded to the telegram by sending the Deputy Foreign Minister Vasili Vasilyevich Kuznetsov to Finland. At a secret meeting, he convinced Kekkonen that the Soviet policy towards Finland hadn't changed and Finland had a right to solve its internal policy alone. After the visit Belyakov started to create contacts outside the Finnish Communist Party, especially with the centre-right National Coalition Party and industrialists and bankers. Belyakov's countdown to leaving Finland started at President Kekkonen's dinner party in Kekkonen's official Tamminiemi residence where he was very drunk and behaved badly. Vladimirov sent a telegram to the Kremlin on the following day, and suggested that Belyakov be sent back to Moscow. Belyakov left in February 1971 for Moscow, never to visit Finland again.

This includes the supervision of banks, insurance companies, stock exchanges and securities dealers, as well as other financial intermediaries in Switzerland. The FINMA is an independent institution with its own legal personality based in Bern. It is institutionally, functionally and financially independent from the central federal administration and the Federal Department of Finance and reports directly to the Swiss parliament. The FINMA is called , , . Its main name and its acronym are expressed in English so as to avoid the semblance of favouring any one of Switzerland's linguistic regions. Anne H√©ritier Lachat was Chairwoman of the Board of Directors from 2011 until 1 January 2016 when Thomas Bauer, former Ernst & Young partner became Chairman. History FINMA was founded on the 22 June 2007 with the passing of the Federal Act on the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMASA). This merged the Federal Office of Private Insurance (FOPI), the Swiss Federal Banking Commission (German acronym: EBK) and the Anti-Money Laundering Control Authority into one agency responsible for all financial regulation in Switzerland. Banking and financial regulation has a long history in Switzerland and the Swiss Federal Banking Commission was in existence since at least 1934, before it was merged into the FINMA. Switzerland is home to two of the worlds major banks UBS and Credit Suisse and as these are significant to the Swiss economy, FINMA has a special regulatory team dedicated to each of these two institutions. UBS and US tax affair On 19 February 2009, the US government filed suit against UBS to reveal the names of all 52,000 American customers, alleging that the bank and these customers conspired to defraud the US tax authority IRS of legitimately owed tax revenue. However revealing customer names was contrary to Swiss law and put UBS in a difficult position. Eventually UBS, with the support of FINMA, agreed to provide the names of 250 to 300 clients through FINMA and pay U.S. $780 million fines to settle the matter. FINMA used a section of the Act provided for situations where a bank is threatened with bankruptcy to allow this to happen. Subsequently, in February 2009 the Federal Administrative Court of Switzerland ordered FINMA to stop the transmission to the U.S. tax authorities. However it is believed that data from 250 UBS clients had already been transmitted. Responsibilities and functions As a state regulatory body, the FINMA is endowed with supreme authority over banks, insurance companies, stock exchanges, securities dealers and collective investment schemes. It is responsible for combating money laundering and, where necessary, conducts financial restructuring and bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, it has supervisory powers with respect to the disclosure of participations and is the complaints body for decisions of the Takeover Board in the area of public takeover bids for listed companies. The FINMA grants operating licences for companies and organisations subject to its supervision, monitors the supervised institutions with respect to their compliance with the requisite laws, ordinances, directives and regulations, as well as with the conditions for the granting of licences that must be complied with at all times. Where necessary and to the extent permissible by law, the FINMA imposes sanctions, provides administrative assistance and regulates. In other words, it participates in the amendment of laws and corresponding ordinances, issues circulars and, where it is authorized to do so, its own ordinances. FINMA is also responsible for ensuring that self-regulation is acknowledged appropriately. The FINMA provides supervision where there is a risk to creditors, investors and policy holders and can penalise individuals or authority, its decision, however, can be challenged in a court. It can also ensure compliance, issue warnings, cancel licenses and liquidate companies. Supervision: FINMA takes a risk-based approach to its supervision of financial institutions, working to identify threats that could affect individual institutions or the entire financial system. FINMA is particularly vigilant about money laundering and the financing of terrorism and closely monitors the Swiss financial markets for AML/CFT compliance. Organisational structure The FINMA is made up of a board of directors, an executive board and an extended executive board. The Board of Directors is a strategic management body and has seven to nine independent expert members appointed via parliament. It decides on matters of substantial importance, issues ordinances and circulars, and is responsible for FINMA‚Äôs budget. It also ensures internal controls by means of an internal audit unit and oversees the Executive Board. The Board of Directors maintains institutionalised contact at the highest management level with key authorities and organisations in Switzerland and abroad. It thus has the opportunity to raise important developments and issues with selected stakeholders. The Executive Board is FINMA's operational management body and is responsible for ensuring that banks, insurance companies, stock exchanges, securities dealers and other financial intermediaries are supervised in accordance with the law and respective strategy. The Executive Board decides on matters such as the granting of licences, key management, organisational and personnel issues, directives and supervisory matters of cross-divisional significance. The Executive Board prepares the necessary files and materials for decisions on items of business that fall under the remit of the Board of Directors and is responsible for implementing the resolutions of the Board of Directors and its committees. The Extended Executive Board assists and relieves the burden on the Executive Board. It performs key functions in relation to strategy implementation, staff development and the representation of the FINMA towards external audiences.

He is best remembered for his recordings, including \\"A Little Every Day\\" and \\"Everybody's Boogie\\". Biography Davis was born in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and relocated with his family to Chicago at the age of two. Seven years later he had lost his sight. In his early years Davis backed Merline Johnson, and by his mid- twenties he was a well-known and reliable accompanying pianist. Between 1937 and 1942, he recorded with Big Bill Broonzy, Sonny Boy Williamson I, Tampa Red, Red Nelson, Merline Johnson, and others. He also made several records of his own, singing in his lightweight voice. Having played in various recording sessions with Lonnie Johnson, Davis teamed up with him in the 1940s. He recorded later on his own. His \\"No Mail Today\\" (1949) was a minor hit. Most of Doctor Clayton's later recordings featured Davis on piano. He toured Europe with Broonzy in 1952, the first blues pianist to do so. In later years Davis toured and recorded frequently in Europe, where he enjoyed a higher profile than in the United States. In 1955, Davis's house in Chicago burned down. His wife died in the fire, and his collection of 1700 78-rpm records, some of them unissued, was destroyed.Olderen, Martin van (1997). Liner notes.

Biography Antonio Marcegaglia obtained an honours degree in business studies from Milan's Luigi Bocconi University in 1987 and joined the Marcegaglia full-time a few days later. He forged an indissoluble bond between his personal career and the growth of this fine mid-sized Italian company of those days, later transforming it into today's major global player. Led by Antonio Marcegaglia, the diversification of the group was then extended with the establishment of Bioindustrie Mantovane and the acquisition of Oskar of Osteria Grande (Bologna), Nuova Omec, Ennepi of Lugo di Romagna (Ravenna) and Imat of Fontanafredda (Pordenone) in 1988 and of CCT of Gallarate (Varese) and Elet.Ca of Capalle (Florence) in 1989, as well as the foundation in 1989 of Marcegaglia Impianti of Saronno (Varese). In the same year, Marcegaglia acquired holdings in Fergallo of Motteggiana (Mantua), SIM of Sant'Atto (Teramo) and Elletre of Montebello Vicentino (Vicenza). In 1991 the Group acquired Resco Tubi of Cusago (Milan) and OMF of Fiume Veneto (Pordenone). In 1994 it acquired Brollo Profilati of Desio (Milan), later moved to the ‚Äúformer Breda‚Äù area just outside Milan, on a site totalling 8 hectares purchased in 1996, and then in 1995 ETA Euro Tubi Acciaio of Milan, followed by a stake in Allu's of Sesto al Reghena (Pordenone). The new business and production constellation enabled the group to have a presence also in the sectors of metal household items, electrostatic paint for metals and metal components for the electrical appliance industry. Meanwhile, its metallurgical sector grew with the production of fine stainless steel tubes and cold-rolled profiles. In 1996, the Euro Energy Group was also established in order to create plants for the production of energy from renewable sources. In January 1997 Nuova Forsidera Spa,Corriere della Sera Marcegaglia rileva Forsidera specialising in steel cold rolling and galvanising processes, was acquired with its plants in Corsico (Milan) and Albignasego (Padua). The group's energy division was expanded in 1997 under the guidance of Antonio Marcegaglia with the establishment of Green Power, for the development of strategies and systems for energy generation through the gasification of waste and biomass. Further expansion came in 1998, with the creation of Boiler Expertise to design and construct the industrial and power boilers. In that same year came the acquisition of Astra of Mezzolara, Budrio (Bologna), and the Siderplating establishment was also acquired, under the name of Marcegaglia San Giorgio of Nogaro (Udine), producing rolling mill plates. Antonio Marcegaglia's corporate development programme continued in 1999 with the acquisition of Morteo Nord of Pozzolo Formigaro (Alessandria),La Stampa Marcegaglia: rilancio della Morteo in 3 anni and Ponteggi Dalmine of Milan, Graffignana (Lodi) and Potenza. This was followed in 2001 by the acquisition, in the tourism sector, of the holiday resort of Pugnochiuso, situated on the Gargano promontory in Apulia. In December 2001, following an investment of over 500 million euros over very few years, a large new centre of production was opened in Ravenna, the second largest iron and steel centre in Italy. And in 2002, in the former Belleli area in Taranto, its second largest production plant in the South, after the one in Potenza, entered into operation In 2003, the sector of products for the household electrical appliance industry expanded further with the acquisition of BVB of San Lorenzo in Campo (Pesaro). While in 2004 the group took a fundamental step in the development of its activities in the tourism sector by acquiring, with Banca Intesa and the Ifil group, 49% of Sviluppo Italia Turismo In 2007 Antonio Marcegaglia acquired the stake in Gabetti Property Solutions and upgraded the Ravenna plant with a further investment of 300 million euros. The Group continued its expansion in the energy sector where, with its subsidiary Arendi, began production of photovoltaic panels. Likewise, its presence in tourism grew further with the acquisition of the management of Forte Village of Santa Margherita di Pula, in Sardinia, the largest hotel complex in Italy and Europe. This was followed soon after by the ‚ÄúLe Tonnare‚Äù holiday resort in Stintino, in the province of Sassari. In 2007 the production plant at Boltiere (Bergamo) was also enlarged. In 2008 the Group acquired the holiday location at Castel Monastero di Castelnuovo Berardenga (Siena) and the \\"Former Arsenale\\" property complex at La Maddalena (Sassari). Since 2017, following the assignment of the Ilva Group to AM Investco (the joint-venture consisting of ArcelorMittal and Marcegaglia), Antonio Marcegaglia has been promoting the relaunch of this great European steelworks asset. The objective is to strengthen its position as a market leader and to increase the company's market share in the European and World iron and steel works industry.  Internationalisation of the Group  In 1989, Antonio Marcegaglia launched the Marcegaglia Group's internationalisation policy which has strengthened its direct presence in the international markets. Marcegaglia Deutschland of D√ºsseldorf was established in 1989 for the distribution of the Group's own products on the German market and in Scandinavia. United Stainless Steel was also created in the UK near London, followed by Marcegaglia U.K., for the production of welded tubes from hot and cold rolled strip, and then by Marcegaglia UK at Dudley, West Midlands. In 1991 Antonio Marcegaglia launched the project which would see the group enter into the transatlantic markets. In the second half of the year The New Bishop Tube of Philadelphia was acquired in the US, and, in February 1992, Damascus of Greenville. Two major production units which then led to the creation of Damascus-Bishop Tube Company, specialising in the production of stainless steel. In 1993 Antonio Marcegaglia acquired the Belgian Cotubel group, a distributor of stainless steel products and tubes in France and Benelux, and founded the trading company Central Bright Steel for the distribution of welded tubes in the UK; it also began production of these same products near Birmingham in 1997. In the summer of 1998, a large industrial area in Munhall, near Pittsburgh, was acquired to accommodate the new Marcegaglia USA, which would also incorporate the Damascus-Bishop Tube Company. During the same period, two other companies were formed in the United States, as subsidiaries of the parent companies in Italy: Oskar Usa in Birmingham (Alabama) and Oto Mills Usa in Wheaton (Illinois). In 1999 Antonio Marcegaglia's efforts led to the incorporation of Marcegaglia Iberica, Marcegaglia Ireland, Marcegaglia France, Marcegaglia Austria and Marcegaglia do Brasil, the latter tripling its turnover by 2005, extending its plant and taking the number of its employees to 1000. Meanwhile, in Bremen, in joint venture with the Arbed Group, the first Marcegaglia company to produce quality steel was formed. In 2000, the Group acquired Earcanal of Leioa, Spain. Following the joint venture with Arbed, in 2004 the Marcegaglia Group signed an agreement with the Corus group for the 10-year co-management of its British steelworks on Teesside, guaranteeing the supply at cost price of one million tonnes per year of slabs for the production of coils and sheets. Oto Mills do Brasil was founded in San Paolo in the same year. In 2005 the Group proceeded with the expansion of Marcegaglia do Brasil, and in June Antonio Marcegaglia opened its fourth overseas production plant in Praszka (Poland), to manufacture tubes for refrigeration, panels and corrugated steel sheets. One year later, 20 kilometres away, the plant at Kluczbork was added, for the production of tubes and drawn products. Marcegaglia established Marcegaglia Gulf at Doha, Qatar in 2007. The expansion of its industrial activities continued in 2008 with its entry into China, where, in Yangzhou, 350 km north- west of Shanghai,Agichina24 - Marcegaglia investe a Shanghai it created its first Asian plant for the production of stainless steel tubes and high- precision carbon steel, with the establishment of Marcegaglia Romania at Cluj, and with the start of work on the new production plant at Vladimir, Russia.

An influential woman politician in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth during the reign of Augustus II the Strong, she was deeply embroiled in the Great Northern War and in R√°k√≥czi's War for [Hungarian] Independence. She was considered the most powerful woman in the Commonwealth and was called \\"the uncrowned Queen of Poland\\". Biography Early life El≈ºbieta was the only child of Prince Stanis≈Çaw Herakliusz Lubomirski by his first wife Countess Zofia Opali≈Ñska. Her father, a neostoic known as the Polish Solomon, had a great influence on her education and politics. After her father's death she inherited many of his estates, including Pu≈Çawy, ≈Åubnice, Siekierki, Czerniak√≥w and many other properties in Warsaw. She was educated in the Visitationist Sisters boarding- school in Warsaw and in 1680 she was admitted at the court as a lady-in- waiting of Queen Marie Casimire. In 1687, she married Adam Miko≈Çaj Sieniawski, Grand Hetman of the Crown, and despite her husband's demands she stayed in Warsaw, where she got involved in a famed romance with Jan Stanis≈Çaw Jab≈Çonowski. She was reconciled with her husband, but soon after, her affair with Aleksander Benedykt Sobieski became well known. Her financial independence caused conflict with her husband and she was forced to defend her property and income from his interference. Eventually, the hetmaness achieved equilibrium within their marriage, and sometimes even underlined her leadership role in their intimate relations addressing Sieniawski as My dear Maiden in her letters. Monsieur de Mongrillon, secretary of the French Embassy in the period 1694-1698, recalled in his memoirs: she is a true Amazon [...] She smokes like a man. It is said that the Tatar ambassador who came to Poland with peace overtures came to smoke by her bed and she smoked with him. Stateswoman El≈ºbieta Sieniawska by √Åd√°m M√°nyoki The hetmaness was \\"a lady of great wisdom, reason and shrewdness\\" and she was deployed by her husband on diplomatic missions, duties and obligations that he could not cope with. Otwinowski called her \\"a great owner of such shrewdness that she had meetings with the whole of Europe\\". Others called her \\"a great ruler and the First Lady of the Republic\\" and Augustus II had her portrait amid the effigies of distinguished women. After John III Sobieski's death she supported the French candidature of Fran√ßois Louis, Prince of Conti for the Polish throne and became a leader of his party. When she became disillusioned with his candidature, she affiliated with Augustus II. After Queen Marie Casimire's departure to Rome, she administered her widow dowry in Warsaw. Between 1701 and 1703, due to incitement of the French diplomacy, she was involved in the anti-Habsburg insurrection in Hungary, which she financially and politically supported. The rebellion's leader Francis II R√°k√≥czi, Prince of Transylvania, became her lover. In the Sieniawskis' estate in Berezhany, R√°k√≥czi issued a proclamation To all Hungarians considered as the beginning of the uprising. Their discreet romance flourished in the turbulent years of war. He wrote a madrigal in French dedicated to the hetmaness and his love letters are interesting examples of epistolography. When in 1704, Jakub and Konstanty Sobieskis were kidnapped and imprisoned in Saxony, Aleksander resigned from the rivalry for the crown, afraid of revenge from his former lover (at that time Wettin partisan). Sarmatian pose and in male delia cloak, by Louis de Silvestre In 1706, after Augustus II's abdication, she engaged in the negotiations to reach an agreement between the tsar Peter I of Russia and king Charles XII of Sweden. During the negotiations she met with her former lover Jab≈Çonowski, King Leszczy≈Ñski's envoy. Sieniawska was abducted in November 1707 by the Swedish Army and met with the king himself. She was released after a month due to French mediation. After Augustus' abdication Sieniawska's husband become one of the most significant players in the struggle for Polish crown. He was considered as one of the leaders of the Sandomierz Confederation, and starting from 1707 he negotiated with the Tsar Peter I his own candidature to the throne. But his wife strongly opposed his candidacy and threatened him with divorce. She did however support the candidature of her lover Francis R√°k√≥czi as the most appropriate in a very difficult political situation of the Serenissima. With a support of a French diplomat Jean Victor de Besenval she was involved in peace mediations. After the declaration of interregnum in the Commonwealth in July 1707 an agreement was reached and on 8 August 1707 the Lublin Council was appointed. Because of robberies and other abuses by Russian troops, Sejm began to enforce the Sieniawska's protegee. When those plans failed, she endeavoured to legalise Leszczy≈Ñski's election and to remove all foreign troops from the country. In her politics, she also aimed to reduce the Russian influences in the Commonwealth. She was an unscrupulous politician participating in political affairs on a large scale, establishing secret contacts with different camps and conducting various personal intrigues ‚Äì Charles XII of Sweden referred to her as \\"that most accursed woman\\". Since 1709, she fostered Konstanty's candidature to the throne (he visited her together with Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñksi in Lviv in Spring 1709), and though she was against the Wettin restoration, she could accommodate to Augustus II being already in possession of the Polish crown. To the baptism of her only daughter in 1711 in Jaros≈Çaw she invited the powerful of the age. Among the godparents were Tsar Peter I, King Augustus II and prince R√°k√≥czi, accompanied by about 15000 soldiers. The tsar Peter I was attracted by her unusual intelligence and it is believed that she became his mistress. During his stay in Jawor√≥w in May 1711, according to the French ambassador Sieur Baluze, they talked endlessly and built a boat together. Later life Maria Zofia Czartoryska, heiress of Sieniawska's fortune In the following years, the hetmaness retired from politics, and concentrated on administration of her vast estates and their economic development. In one of her letters of 17 July 1726 Sieniawska reprimanded an accountant in the Tenczyn Castle, Monsieur Zabag≈Çowicz: Among her close collaborators were Ko≈Ñskowola canon Andrzej Stanis≈Çaw Tucci and a Jewish woman Feyga Leybowiczowa, to whom she entrusted the management of mills and inns in Ko≈Ñskowola. She also supported Jewish settlement on her lands (on 2 May 1718 she issued a privilege for the Jews to settle in Stasz√≥w and build a synagogue). Sieniawski family, 1724‚Äì1726 She also focused on constructional foundations. In 1720, she established the new orangery of the Wilan√≥w Palace, in 1722 she started the reconstruction of the Pu≈Çawy Palace and in 1730 she enlarged the ≈Åubnice Palace, at that time artistic center of Sieniawska's properties. From Konstanty she purchased Olesko and Ternopil and in 1720 the Sobieskis colifichet de gentillesse (the most pleasant trinket) ‚Äì Wilan√≥w Palace. Among her most notable foundations are the church and monastery for the Capuchin friars in Lviv founded in 1708 and accomplished in 1718, the wooden mansion in Oleszyce (1713), a palace-orangery in Sieniawa (1718), the Discalced Carmelite Sisters Church in Lublin (before 1721), the palace in Wysocko (1720s), the two storied palace in Przybys≈Çawice (1720s), reconstruction of the Founding of Holy Cross Parish Church in Ko≈Ñskowola (1724), the St. Elisabeth's Church in Powsin (1725), reconstruction of the Lubomirski Palace in Lublin (1725‚Äì1728) ‚Äì some of them she erected together with her husband. When Sieniawska's daughter widowed in 1728 her new marriage become a significant matter, not only in the Commonwealth but also in Europe. After her father's death in 1726 Maria Zofia inherited his Ruthenian estates including 35 towns, 235 villages and Berezhany fortress, she was also the only inheritor of her husband's estates and of her mother's fortune. Among the candidates to the hand of one of the wealthiest women in Europe were Charles de Bourbon-Cond√©, Count of Charolais supported by France (Louis XV even invited Maria Zofia to Versailles), Portuguese infante Dom Manuel de Bragan√ßa supported by the Habsburgs (proposed as the next King of Poland, due to the tenets of the L√∂wenwolde's Treaty), Jan Klemens Branicki, Franciszek Salezy Potocki, Jan Tar≈Ço and August Aleksander Czartoryski, who eventually won the competition full of duels and speech encounters due to support of Augustus II, as the latter was afraid of increase of power of his opponents. Patronage El≈ºbieta Sieniawska as Flora by Giuseppe Rossi Through her extensive contacts from Neuburg court, through Prague, Vienna and Wroc≈Çaw, the hetmaness brought to Poland many renowned artists. √Åd√°m M√°nyoki, R√°k√≥czi's court painter, before he was appointed official court painter of Augustus II was at Sieniawska's service in Warsaw since 1713. She employed the most prominent artists active in the Commonwealth. Among them there were architects Giovanni Spazzio, J√≥zef Fontana, Karol Bay, Efraim Szreger and Franti≈°ek Mayer of Moravia, painters Jan Jerzy Plersch and Giuseppe Rossi, eminent sculptors of Bohemian Baroque Jan Elij√°≈° and Hynek Hoffmanns, stucco decorators Francesco Fumo and Pietro Innocente Comparetti, gardener Georg Zeidler of Saxony. She also employed Dresden court artists such as Johann Sigmund Deybel, Louis de Silvestre and sculptor Jean-Joseph Vinache and was a patron of young talented artists, like Julius Perty son of her architect Jacob, who was trained in Charles de Prevot's atelier in Sandomierz between 1726‚Äì1730. Among her protegees was also a poet El≈ºbieta Dru≈ºbacka known as the Sarmatian Muse. The Wilan√≥w Palace wings were constructed by Sieniawska between 1720‚Äì1729. In 1713, the king Augustus II purchased the Morsztyn Palace and neighbouring allotments and started the construction of a new palace ‚Äì so called Saxon Palace. Modelled after Versailles, it was the largest building in Warsaw, apart from the Sobieski's Marywil. It was a time of late baroque and rococo, when theatrum mundi, with its theatrical decorations played an essential role, not only in founder's glorification but also in politics to confirm the status. That is why the facade of the new palace was considered as rather poor (all the major funds were intended to embellished the prince-elector's capital in Dresden, Germany). Sieniawska, who competed with the king in architectural foundations, choose an old Royal edifice ‚Äì the Visitationist Church established by Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga, as her major propaganda investment in the capital. Probably the most important was its location at the Cracow Suburb Street, in front of the main entrance to the new royal residence, so everyone who visited the king must pass before the ornate Sieniawska's magnum opus. She appointed her court architect Karol Bay to design a new rococo facade profusely embellished with columns and sculptures. The conservation and enlargement of the former residence of Victorious King, John III Sobieski, is considered as her most significant achievement in the field of architecture. She embellished the palace facades and garden parterres with her coat of arms Szreniawa and monograms. For the decoration of the palace's interiors she nominated an Italian fresco painter Giuseppe Rossi, who adorned the chambers with trompe-l'≈ìil paintings and mythological plafonds. By taking the example of Queen Marie Casimire, that ordered to paint her as a goddess in palace plafonds, the hetmaness decorated the Lower Vestibule with a fresco depicting her as a Roman goddess of fertility ‚Äì Flora (she was almost 60 at that time). In 1729, she erected the mausoleum in Berezhany to commemorate her husband, the last male line descendant of the Sieniawski family, but she did not complete the interior. El≈ºbieta Sieniawska died the same year in Oleszyce.

Situated at an altitude of 642 m, it overlooks the other two castles. History Ch√¢teau du Haut-Ribeaupierre is the oldest of the Ribeaupierre's castles, its existence being known from 1084. It was constructed on an ancient Roman site. Then known as the \\"Altenkastel\\", it was Anselme de Ribeaupierre who took possession of the castle in 1288. Around 1368, Brunon de Ribeaupierre became owner. Dedicated to a ferocious hatred for the English, he imprisoned Sir John Harleston, who had an imperial safe conduct, in the keep from 1384 to 1387. He was only freed with the payment of a large ransom and after pressure from the Holy Roman Empire. At the end of the 13th century, the castle became a residence of the Ribeaupierres. Another noted prisoner was held in the keep in 1477. Philippe de Croy, Count of Chimay, ally of Charles the Bold, was captured by a Ribeaupierre at Nancy.

It is the last French factory of Swimmers, Poupons and traditional dolls still operating. It still manufactures the plastic version of the swimming doll Petit Collin, production of which began around 1924-26. History The Petitcollin factory floor. In the early 1800s, Nicolas Petitcollin, the company's founder, manufactured horn combs in √âtain, Meuse, France. Since 1864, the company has been headquartered in Paris. Nicolas Petitcollin began working in celluloid in the late 1800s. In 1901, the company adopted an eagle's head logo, which it retains to this day. It has been listed on the Paris Stock Exchange since November 27, 1906. It began manufacturing dolls in 1912. During World War I, the factory in √âtain was completely destroyed. Nonetheless Petitcollin thrived during the interwar period. Around 1924-1926, the Petitcollin company innovated by launching on the market a baby doll which can be bathed, the swimming doll \\"Petit Collin\\". With the arrival of polyester resins, Petitcollin decided to specialize in manufacturing objects made from the material. In 1961 it became the first French manufacturer of polyester resin helmets, operating from a rebuilt factory in √âtain. In 1995, Vilac acquired the company, which became known as SARL Jouets Petitcollin. The factory has been open to the public since 1998. It is the only operational doll factory in France; the company was given the Label Entreprise du partimoine vivant (Living Heritage Company label) by the French government in 2007.

Life He was the son of Luke Milbourne (1622‚Äì1668), an ejected minister who was the incumbent of Wroxhall, Warwickshire, where he was born. His mother's name was Ph≈ìbe. The antiquarian John Nelson states that the family lived at Newington Green, well known for its dissenting academies, where they kept a boarding school; Phoebe taught, because her husband was barred from doing so. The younger Luke was educated at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1667, and graduated B.A. in 1670. After graduating he appears to have held chaplaincies to the English merchants at Hamburg and at St Mary's Church, Rotterdam. He was afterwards at Harwich, and was beneficed in the beginning of William III's reign at Great Yarmouth. There he associated much with Rowland Davies, later dean of Cork, and wrote a lampoon on the town, entitled Ostia. In 1688 he had become lecturer of St Leonard's, Shoreditch, and in 1704 he succeeded Samuel Harris as rector of St Ethelburga's Bishopsgate. He is ‚Äòthe priest of the church of England and rector of a church in the city of London‚Äô who, in a published Letter (1713) to Roger Laurence, author of Lay Baptism Invalid, rejected the validity of lay baptism by the authority of Calvin and of French Protestant writers. Many of his numerous printed sermons touched on the martyrdom of Charles I, and enforcing the duty of passive obedience. After listening to one of Milbourne's high-flying sermons in January 1713, Bishop White Kennett asked indignantly ‚Äòwhy he did not stay in Holland?‚Äô and ‚Äòwhy he is suffered to stay in England?‚Äô He died in London 15 April 1720. Critic Milbourne is mainly remembered on account of his strictures on John Dryden's translation of Virgil, and of the retaliation made upon him both by Dryden, and by Alexander Pope on Dryden's behalf. He was coupled with Sir Richard Blackmore in Pope's Art of Criticism as the type of all that is contemptible in a critic. Milbourne attempted an English rendering of Virgil before Dryden. According to an advertisementAt the close of ‚ÄòThe Comparison of Pindar and Horace: written in French by M. Blondel, Master in Mathematics to the Dauphin. English'd by Sir Edward Sherburn,‚Äô and published in 1696. Milbourne had then issued The First Book of Virgil's √Üneis made English. No copy may be now known. Dryden's translation appeared in 1697, and its success inspired Milbourne's attack on it.In his Notes on Dryden's Virgil, in a Letter to a Friend, with an Essay on the same Poet, London, 1698. In order to demonstrate his own superiority, Milbourne supplemented criticisms by specimens of his own translation of the first and fourth Eclogues and the first Georgic. Dryden complained in the preface to the Fables (1700) that his critic's scurrility was unprovoked. One of Milbourne's avowed reasons for not sparing Dryden was that Dryden had never spared a clergyman. Dryden replied that if he had fallen foul of the priesthood he had only to ask pardon of good priests, and was afraid Milbourne's ‚Äòpart of the reparation would come to little.‚Äô ‚ÄòI am satisfied,‚Äô he concludes, ‚Äòthat while he and I live together I shall not be thought the worst poet of the age.‚Äô The morals of Milbourne, who, according to Dryden, had lost his living for libelling his parishioners, were severely handled in a poem entitled The Pacificator, 1699. Works He contributed Latin verses to Lacrym√¶ Cantabrigienses, 1670, on the death of Henrietta, Duchess of Orleans. Milbourne's other works, apart from 31 single sermons and some tracts, are: * ‚ÄòA Short Defence of the Order of the Church of England, by a Presbyter of the Diocese of Norwich‚Äô (anon.), 1688. * ‚ÄòMysteries in Religion vindicated, or the Filiation, Deity, and Satisfaction of our Saviour asserted against Socinians and others, with occasional reflections on several late pamphlets,‚Äô London, 1692. * A metrical version of ‚ÄòThe Imitation of Christ,‚Äô entitled ‚ÄòThe Christian Pattern Paraphrased,‚Äô 1697. * ‚ÄòThe Psalms of David in English Metre,‚Äô 1698. * ‚ÄòTom of Bedlam's answer to his Brother, Ben Hoadly,‚Äô 1709. * ‚ÄòThe Moderate Cabal, a Satyr in Verse,‚Äô 1710 (anon.). * ‚ÄòThe Two Wolves in Lamb's Skins, or Old Eli's sorrowful Lamentations over his two Sons,‚Äô 1716. * ‚ÄòA Legacy to the Church of England, vindicating her Orders from the Objections of Papists and Dissenters,‚Äô 2 vols.

Life and career Otis Leavill Cobb was born in Dewey Rose, Elbert County, Georgia, and moved with his family to the West Side of Chicago at the age of two. His father was pastor of the First Church of Deliverance on South Wabash Avenue, and he started singing in the family's gospel group, the Cobb Quartet.[ Biography by Andrew Hamilton at AllMusic]. Accessed 8 February 2010 In his teens, he took part in amateur boxing with his friend Major Lance, graduated from Crane High School, and attended college. With Lance and Barbara Tyson, he formed a short-lived vocal group, The Floats, who recorded an unreleased demo record in 1958/59. He released his first record, \\"Rise Sally Rise\\" coupled with \\"I Gotta Right To Cry\\" - written by another friend, Curtis Mayfield - on the small Lucky label in 1963, and then issued two singles on the Limelight label. His fourth record, \\"Let Her Love Me\\", written by Billy Butler, produced by Major Lance, and with The Impressions on backing vocals, was issued by Blue Rock Records in late 1964, and rose to # 31 on the Billboard R&B; chart, its success leading to Leavill touring with Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars. However, follow-up records on Blue Rock were unsuccessful, and he moved to on to record in the 1960s for several other labels. As a talent scout and assistant producer, he worked with Carl Davis at both Okeh and Brunswick, where he was credited with discovering The Chi-Lites, Tyrone Davis, Hamilton Bohannon, and Yvette Stevens who became better known as Chaka Khan. In 1967 Davis formed Dakar Records, and Leavill joined him as Vice- President. Leavill also recorded with Dakar, and in 1969 \\"I Love You\\", written by Eugene Record of The Chi-Lites and with backing vocals by Record and Barbara Acklin, became his biggest chart hit, reaching # 10 on the R&B; chart. The follow-up, \\"Love Uprising\\", also written by Record (and credited to \\"Otis Leaville\\"), again made the R&B; charts. His later records were unsuccessful, but Leavill continued to work with, and write songs for, such artists as Major Lance, Tyrone Davis, and Gene Chandler on labels including Brunswick and Chi- Sound. He also coached football at Hyde Park High for several years, and worked as a policeman. In 1999 he toured Europe with The Dells, and in 2000 he formed the OK Records label.

The film premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival on 11 February 2009 and was released theatrically in the United States on 19 February 2010. Plot synopsis Jayne (Posey) and Laura (Moore) play sisters helping their crude but endearing father Joe (Torn) deal with age-related health and mental problems. Wealthy by marriage, Jayne is otherwise psychologically fragile. Conversely, Laura has her hands full with domestic responsibilities but is considerably more grounded. Upon returning to their childhood home to help their father, they face difficult, frequently comic situations. The home, their deceased mother's effects, and their father's eccentricities evoke memories and sentiments, especially for Jayne. The sisters bicker over the seriousness of their father's condition. They also contend with a romantic dalliance between Joe and his equally eccentric, wigged-out \\"nurse\\" Shelly (Barkin).

The full form is the difficult Paripurna Matsyendrasana. A common and easier variant is Ardha Matsyendrasana. The asana usually appears as a seated spinal twist with many variations, and in its half form is one of the twelve basic asanas in many systems of hatha yoga.  Etymology and origins Historic halftone engraving of the pose from the cover of Yoga Sopana, 1905, the first modern illustrated book on yoga The name comes from the Sanskrit words ‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§£ Paripurna, perfected; ‡§Æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç Matsyendra, one of the founders of hatha yoga, whose name in turn means \\"lord of the fishes\\"; and ‡§Ü‡§∏‡§® asana, posture or seat; ‡§Ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§ß ardha means half. The asana is medieval, described in the 15th century Ha·π≠ha Yoga Pradƒ´pikƒÅ 1.26-7, which states that it destroys many diseases, and the 17th century Ghera·πá·∏ça Sa·πÉhitƒÅ 2.22-23. Yogi Ghamande chose the asana for the cover of his historic 1905 book Yogasopana Purvacatuska; he represented the pose using a halftone plate, giving for the first time a realistic impression of the body of the yogi.  Description  One foot is placed flat on the floor outside the opposite leg and torso twists toward the top leg. The bottom leg may be bent with the foot outside the opposite hip or extended with toes vertically. The arms help leverage the torso into the twist and may be bound (Baddha Ardha Matsyendrasana) in a number of configurations by clutching either feet or opposite hands. Variations Ardha Matsyendrasana I In this pose, sit with one leg bent on the ground, the foot tucked in close to the body, and cross the other leg over across the body, the knee raised and bent, and the foot on the ground by the outside of the other leg. Twist the body and grasp the raised knee; or, bring the arm over to press against the raised knee; or clasp the hands behind the back. Ardha Matsyendrasana II This variant has one leg straight out on the ground, the other bent as for Padmasana; the hand on the bent leg side grasps the outside of the outstretched boot, and the other hand reaches round the back to grasp the calf of the bent leg. Ardha Matsyendrasana III From Ardha Matsyendrasana I, the bottom leg moves into Padmasana, and the arms bind by grabbing both feet. Supta Matsyendrasana For the reclining variant of the pose, starting from a supine position, stretch the arms out at shoulder level, bend one knee and rotate it and the hips across to the opposite side.

He took part in the bitter fighting at Tobruk during the North Africa campaign. From North Africa he joined the Royal Air Force in England. In 1942 he was accepted for training in the Royal Air Force. While serving near Nottingham he married a fellow Pole in the WRAF, Danuta Banszel. He was then posted to No. 307 Polish Night Fighter Squadron at Exeter. Sculpture After the war he moved to Nottingham and continued his studies in sculpture at Nottingham College of Art. In 1953 he opened his first studio and produced much of his work in alabaster. The themes of his abstract forms were influenced by his experiences during World War II. In 1959 he had a piece selected for the Royal Academy summer exhibition, and in 1963 his exhibition at the Drian Gallery led to his connection with the hospice movement. His best known work is the sculpture for Dame Cicely Saunders‚Äôs St Christopher's Hospice at Sydenham. It shows St Christopher carrying Christ across the water. The sculpture was unveiled by Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy.

The model uses stack sizes alone to determine how often a player will finish in each position (1st, 2nd, etc.). A player's probability of finishing in each position is then multiplied by the prize amount for that position and those numbers are added together to determine the player's overall equity. The term ICM is often misunderstood to mean a simulator that helps a player make decisions in a tournament. Such simulators often make use of the Independent Chip Model but are not strictly speaking ICM calculators. A true ICM calculator will have the chip counts of all players, as well as the payout structure of the tournament, as input and each player's equity as output. The ICM can be applied to answer specific questions, such as: * The range of hands that a player can move all in with, considering the action so far and the stack sizes of the other players still in the hand * The range of hands that a player can call another player's all in with, and recommends either calling or moving all in over the top, considering all the stacks still in the hand * When discussing a deal, how much money each player should get References Further reading * Harrington discusses the ICM on pages 108-122.

She was a granddaughter of Robert Wood Johnson I (co-founder of Johnson & Johnson), and of Bermudan politician, soldier, and lawyer, Colonel Thomas Melville Dill. She was the first baby to appear on a Johnson's baby powder label. Pg. 129 \\"For six years, he committed incest with Mary Lea...\\" Pg. 126  Early life  Johnson was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Her father was John Seward Johnson I, and her mother was Ruth Dill, the sister of actress Diana Dill, therefore made her a first cousin of actor Michael Douglas. Johnson grew up with five siblings: Elaine Johnson, John Seward Johnson II, Diana Melville Johnson, Jennifer Underwood Johnson, and James Loring \\"Jimmy\\" Johnson. She was sexually abused by her father from age nine to fifteen. \\"She did anything that men wanted,\\" Richards says, sadly, \\"because of the abuse with her father.\\" Her parents divorced around 1937, and her father remarried two years later, producing two half siblings, including Jimmy Johnson, which made her an aunt of film director Jamie Johnson. Johnson graduated from the Masters School in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., and the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts.  Career  Johnson was a founder and partner of Producer Circle, a film and theater production company, which produced Broadway shows such as Sweeney Todd, and Broadway producer. Personal life Johnson was excluded from her father's will, which left the bulk of his fortune to Barbara Piasecka Johnson, her father's wife and former chambermaid. She and her siblings sued on grounds that their father wasn't mentally competent at the time he signed the will. It was settled out of court, and the children were granted about 12% of the fortune. During the largest inheritance battle in history, it was revealed that Johnson was a victim of incest. \\"Mary Lea Johnson was a victim of incest...\\" Johnson's first marriage was to William Ryan, a press agent turned farmer. Before they divorced, the pair had six children: Eric Ryan, Seward Ryan, Hillary Ryan, Quentin Ryan, Roderick Newbold Ryan, and Alice Ryan Marriott. In 1972, she married Dr. Victor D'Arc, a psychiatrist, whom she met while seeking treatment for her son's drug addiction. In 1976, she publicly declared that her estranged husband and his homosexual loverhttp://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20093724,00.html had hired hitmen to have her murdered. Pp. 254. Johnson, who was living with gay Broadway producer Marty Richards, hired a bodyguard, who was beaten almost to death during a break-in that almost killed Johnson and Richards. Subsequently, the Bronx D.A's office made a case, and opened an investigation. No charges were brought, and the pair divorced in 1978. Johnson's third marriage would be to Richards, and last until her death. Her family had a twelve-year-long court battle regarding her husband's eligibility for a share of the Johnson & Johnson fortune. The court ruled in favor of Richards. In 1990, Johnson died of liver cancer at the age of 63. The NYU Mary Lea Johnson Richards Organ Transplantation Center is named after her. See also * Johnson v.

Built as a bakery and shop for a local family, with two floors of living accommodation above, it later passed to another Brighton family who kept up the baking tradition until the mid-20th century. Since then it has had various commercial uses. Described as \\"one of the most famous surviving early buildings\\" in Brighton and \\"a charming relic\\", the exterior is clad in distinctive black glazed mathematical tiles. English Heritage has listed it at Grade II* for its architectural and historical importance. History Brighton is situated on the English Channel coast at a point where several valleys meet the sea. One of these was formed by the flow of the River Wellesbourne, a winterbourne which came to the surface at Patcham. The intermittent flow of the stream created a boggy, marshy area of land around which the old village of Brighthelmstone developed. Just before entering the sea, it formed a small pool. As demand for land grew in the late 18th century during a period of rapid growth, the Wellesbourne was diverted into a culvert and built over: the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Marlborough paid for this. The pool was hidden under a new road, Pool Valley, in 1792‚Äì93. Pool Valley connected the south end of Old Steine and the seafront. Old Steine (or The Steine) was the name now given to the marshy valley bottom previously used by fishermen drying their nets, and for the growing of hemp: it had been drained, and by 1790 it formed the focal point of the growing town of Brighton. Houses and entertainment venues surrounded it and faced the grass, which was used for promenading; railings were built around the land; and the fishermen were evicted. As soon as the new road opened, buildings were built on both sides. The structure at number 9, on the northwest side of the street, was built for both commercial and residential use: the ground floor was used as a bakery, and there were two floors of accommodation above. It may have been built for the Streeters, a local family who were involved in the baking trade. In 1845, the business was run as a bakery and shop by Sarah Streeter. The Cowley family, long established in Brighton, took over at some point before the 1861 Census, after which the business became known as Cowley's Bun Shop and, later, Ye Olde Bunn Shoppe. Around the middle of the 20th century, the building passed out of the Cowley family's ownership, and the ground-floor shop unit was converted to other commercial uses such as a restaurant. The building was listed at Grade II* on 13 October 1952. Such buildings are defined as being \\"particularly important ... [and] of more than special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 70 Grade II*-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. Architecture The building is one of the oldest surviving houses in Brighton, and has been called \\"one of [its] most famous surviving early buildings\\". Its modest appearance and small size prompted architectural historian Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel, a former resident of Brighton, to call it \\"as charming a relic of ... Brighthelmstone [Brighton's former name] as anyone could wish to see\\". It is a three-storey building with a modern shopfront on the lowest floor, two storeys in residential use above, and a large hipped roof with dormer windows. Two missing tiles show the structure of the top floors' cladding The top two floors are laid with black glazed mathematical tiles‚Äîoften used in the 18th and 19th centuries on buildings in Brighton, and a characteristic feature of the local architecture. The second and third storeys also have canted bay windows; to the sides and rear (facing an ancient alleyway), original sash windows remain. The left dormer window is a casement, while the right has a sash window.

Begun in 2007, the initial three-year database project is led by Semitic and Arabic studies Prof. Angelika Neuwirth at the Free University of Berlin. The project is currently funded till 2025, but could well take longer to complete.Andrew Higgins and Almut Schoenfeld, \\"The Lost Archive: Missing for a half century, a cache of photos spurs sensitive research on Islam's holy text\\", Wall Street Journal, 12 January 2008. Retrieved 2010-02-07. Outside of Corpus Coranicum, critical work is scarce. Abdelmajid Charfi printed a critical historical edition in 2018, and Qur'an Gateway provides a commercial database of textual variants of the Quran. Goals and methodology The project will document the Quran in its handwritten form and oral tradition, and include an extensive commentary interpreting the text in the context of its historical development.Corpus Coranicum , retrieved 2010-02-07. Much of the Corpus Coranicum source material consists of photographs of ancient Quran manuscripts collected before World War II by Gotthelf Bergstr√§sser and Otto Pretzl. After the British RAF on 24 April 1944 bombarded the building where they were housed, Arabic studies scholar Anton Spitaler claimed the photograph collection had been destroyed. Towards the end of his life, however, he confessed to Neuwirth that he had hidden the photos for almost half a century, and Neuwirth assumed responsibility for the archive. The project's research director, Michael Marx, told Der Spiegel that the Quran did not arise in a vacuum, as for the sake of simplicity some western researchers had supposed. The Arabian peninsula in the 7th century was exposed to the great Byzantine and Persian Empires as well as the ideas of Gnosticism, early Christianity, the ideals of ancient Arabic poetry and the ideas of rabbinic Judaism. Only in light of this world of ideas, Marx added, \\"can the innovations of the Quran be clearly seen,\\"Yassin Musharbash, \\"Die Klimaforscher des Korans\\" (\\"Climate researchers of the Quran\\") in Der Spiegel, 1 November 2007.

Secondly, a database of international texts (including pre-Quranic and Judeo-Christian texts)\\"Corpus Coranicum prospectus\\".

The third part of the project is to create a commentary focusing not only on individual problems but also including form-critical analyses. The commentary is constructed discursively, taking note of earlier opinions and research on the Quran. The ultimate critical edition will compare surviving pre-Uthmanic variants, variants between the Qira'at (the roughly two dozen versions of Uthman's Quran), manuscript variants within individual Qira'at, and the variants chosen by the 1924 Cairo edition of the Hafs Qira'at. These variants include consonantal mutations, and encompass the addition and removal of whole words. Student Humanities Laboratory In April 2008, Yvonne Pauly wrote that the academy's Student Humanities Laboratory had created a teaching unit on Quranic research, declaring: \\"While the Quran is religiously, culturally and politically influential, it is also controversial, though the heated debate surrounding the text often stands in contrast to an actual knowledge of its contents.\\"\\"Den Koran verstehen lernen\\", press release, 2 April 2008.

Through the example of one of the shorter suras, teenagers would explore the text through the tools of modern philology while experiencing it orally and through calligraphy as well, with the aim of increasing the students' curiosity and scientific interest in the humanities during their transition to university. Controversy In 2007 journalist- publisher Frank Schirrmacher wrote an article for the Frankfurt Book Fair suggesting that the Academy's preparation of a historically critical Quran edition had been motivated by Pope Benedict XVI's ill-received Regensburg lecture of 2006 and predicting that the Corpus Coranicum would spark similar outrage among Muslims, comparing it to the punishment of Prometheus for bringing fire to mankind. He was enthusiastic that the fruits of their research might even \\"overthrow rulers and topple kingdoms\\".Frank Schirrmacher, \\"B√ºcher k√∂nnen Berge versetzen\\" (\\"Books can move mountains\\"), Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung B√ºcher, 10 October 2007. Retrieved 2010-02-06. Marx promptly called the Al-Jazeera television network to deny any attempt to attack Islamic tenets. Angelika Neuwirth demurred: \\"It would be quite wrong to claim triumphantly that we had found the key to the Quran and that Muslims for 14 long centuries had not.\\" Instead, she and her colleagues have chosen a nonconfrontational approach that includes regular dialogue with the Islamic world and aims \\"to give the Quran the same attention as the Bible.\\" Michael Marx, Neuwirth and Nicolai Sinai spiritedly defended the project, writing that negative reaction to the papal speech should not be equated with Islamic hostility towards a historical-textual or philological approach to the Quran.Michael Marx, Angelika Neuwirth and Nicolai Sinai, \\"Koran, aber in Kontext ‚Äî Eine Replik\\" (\\"The Quran, but in context ‚Äî a reply\\"), Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 6 November 2007. On the contrary, they asserted, classical commentaries within the Islamic tradition are concerned with the \\"occasions of revelation\\" (asb√¢b an-nuz√ªl) of particular suras, while Islamic literature discussing alternative interpretations of the Qur'an ‚Äî \\"a sort of textual criticism avant la lettre\\" ‚Äî can fill library shelves. In discussions with Iranian, Arab and Turkish scholars in Tehran, Qom, Damascus, Fez, Rabat, Cairo and Istanbul Marx, Neuwirth and Sinai had contended that even if one considered the Quran as the literal words of God, a contextual reading as a legitimate subject of historical inquiry could create a climate of healthy inquiry and debate among Islamic and non-Islamic researchers alike. The trio's letter also pointed out that the Corpus Coranicum project was in any case not directed to Islamic fundamentalists, but to Germans and other Europeans.

Following its break with the Roman Catholic Church, England attacked Scotland, partly to destroy the Auld Alliance and prevent Scotland being used as a springboard for future invasion by France, partly to weaken Scotland, and partly to force Scotland to agree to a marriage alliance between Mary, Queen of Scots (born 8 December 1542), and the English heir apparent Edward, son of King Henry VIII, (born 12 October 1537). An invasion of France was also contemplated. Henry declared war in an attempt to force the Scots to agree to a marriage between Edward, who was six years old at the start of the war, and the infant queen, thereby creating a new alliance between Scotland and England. Upon Edward's accession to the throne in 1547 at the age of nine, the war continued for a time under the direction of the Duke of Somerset, before Somerset's removal from power in 1549 and replacement by the Duke of Northumberland, who wished for a less costly foreign policy than his predecessor. It was the last major conflict between Scotland and England before the Union of the Crowns in 1603, excepting perhaps the English intervention at the Siege of Leith in 1560, and was part of the Anglo-Scottish Wars of the 16th century. Etymology In Scotland, the war was called the \\"Eight\\" or \\"Nine Years' War\\".Maitland James, A Narrative of the Minority of Mary Queen of Scots, Ipswich (1842) The idea of the war as a \\"Wooing\\" was popularised many years later by Sir Walter Scott,Scott, Walter, Tales of a Grandfather, (1866), 103, (Chp. 29). and the phrase \\"Rough Wooing\\" appeared in several history books from the 1850s onwards.Example; 'A Review of Teulet's France & Scotland,' in North British Review, vol.24 (February 1856), 167 The phrase appears to derive from a famous remark attributed to George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly by Patrick Abercromby in his edition of Jean de Beaugu√©'s history of the war: \\"We liked not the manner of the wooing, and we could not stoop to being bullied into love\\", or, as William Patten reported, \\"I lyke not thys wooyng.\\"Beaugu√©, Jean de, History of the campaigns in Scotland, (1707), lii: from Robert Gordon's manuscript History of the House of Sutherland, according to Crawford's Lives and Characters of the Officers of State, (1726), p.84 footnote (f). The historian William Ferguson contrasted this jocular nickname with the savagery and devastation of the war: More recently, Marcus Merriman titled his book The Rough Wooings to emphasise the division of the conflict into two or three distinct phases.Merriman, Marcus, The Rough Wooings, Tuckwell, (2000), 6‚Äì10 From Solway Moss to Ancrum burnt Edinburgh in May 1544 Surviving buildings in the Old Town of Edinburgh In 1542, a Scottish army suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Solway MossPaterson, pp. 166‚Äì168 and James V died soon after. He was succeeded by his daughter, Mary I, born six days earlier, in the care of her mother, Mary of Guise. The English marriage for James's successor proposed by the Treaty of Greenwich was conditionally accepted by the Scottish government led by Regent Arran. Arran was slow to advance the marriage due to strong internal factions favouring alliance with France and the continuance of the Catholic religion in Scotland. Twenty years later, the English diplomat Ralph Sadler reported Adam Otterburn's words to him on the Scottish opinion of the marriage: In Scotland civil war ensued with the Regent opposed by the Douglas faction in the east and Matthew, Earl of Lennox in the west at the Battle of Glasgow. With this internal background, the Scots then faced the anger of Henry VIII, after the Scottish Parliament renounced the Treaty of Greenwich in December 1543. Five days later, on 20 December, war was declared in Edinburgh by the messenger Henry Ray, Berwick Pursuivant.Merriman (2000), 137. Henry had released Scottish noblemen captured at the Battle of Solway Moss on licence, hoping they would build consensus for the marriage. In March 1544, he sent his Richmond Herald to the Privy Council of Scotland to demand their return. Major hostilities began with an attack on Edinburgh on 3 May 1544,Merriman (2000), 145. led by the Earl of Hertford and Viscount Lisle. Hertford had instructions to burn Edinburgh and issue Henry's proclamation of 24 March 1544, which laid the blame on Cardinal Beaton's \\"sinister enticement\\" of Regent Arran.Letters & Papers of Henry VIII, vol.19 part 1, (1903), nos. 319, 348, 389. Hertford had also considered establishing an English garrison at Leith but the Privy Council had vetoed this plan. Henry VIII had also asked him to destroy St Andrews, but Hertford pointed out the extra distance would be troublesome. After burning St Mynettes on the north side of the Firth of Forth and taking fishing boats for landing-craft, the English army landed at Granton, then occupied Leith.The Late Expedition in Scotland, 1544, London (1544), reprinted in Tudor Tracts, London (1903) 41, 44: Stevenson, Joseph ed., The History of Mary Stewart by Claude Nau, Edinburgh, (1883), 318, 338‚Äì9 Hertford parleyed with Adam Otterburn who was Provost of Edinburgh but he had been instructed not to make terms. The next day the troops entered Edinburgh's Canongate, and set the city on fire. Edinburgh Castle was defended by cannon fire commanding the Royal Mile. Hertford decided not to lay siege but thoroughly burn the city. According to the English contemporary account, all the houses within the suburbs and city walls were burnt including Holyroodhouse and the Abbey. The English ships at Leith were loaded with looted goods and sailed with the captured Unicorn and Salamander. The army returned to England by land, burning towns and villages along the way.Grafton, Richard, A Chronicle at Large, 1569, vol. 2, London (1809), 490‚Äì1: Expedition into Scotland, (1544) Soon after the English force landed, Regent Arran released the Earl of Angus and George Douglas of Pittendreich who had been imprisoned in Blackness Castle. Although they had been supporters of the English marriage, Arran now needed the support of the Douglas family against an English invasion.Laing, David, ed., The Works of John Knox, vol. 1, Bannatyne Society (1846) p. 120. Following this attack, Sir William Eure and Ralph Eure made raids across the border from Berwick upon Tweed, burning houses and buying the loyalty of Scots who became \\"assured men\\". Against these English invasions, the Scots won a victory at the Battle of Ancrum Moor in February 1545.Paterson, pp. 182‚Äì184 Scotland was included in the Treaty of Camp, or Treaty of Ardres, of 6 June 1546, which concluded the Italian War of 1542‚Äì1546. This brought 18 months of peace between England and Scotland.Merriman, Marcus, The Rough Wooings, Tuckwell (2000), 163, 195‚Äì201. In May 1546, Fife lairds had murdered the Francophile Cardinal Beaton at St Andrews Castle. These Protestant lairds became known as the Castilians, and garrisoned the castle against Regent Arran, hoping for English military support.Elizabeth Bonner, (1996) Pinkie to the peace The English retained a fort they had established at Langholm in the Scottish borders. Unable to secure its return by diplomatic leverage, Regent Arran reduced it by force on 17 July 1547 following an unsuccessful attempt in June. At the same time, a French naval force took St Andrews Castle from the Castilians.Merriman, Marcus, The Rough Wooings, Tuckwell (2000), 221‚Äì229. On 24 July Arran ordered seven signal beacons to be prepared to warn of an expected English invasion by sea. The first was at St Abb's Head, the second at Dowhill near Fast Castle, next on the Doun Law near Spott, North Berwick Law, 'Dounprenderlaw', at Arthur's Seat or Edinburgh Castle, and at 'Binning's Craig' near Linlithgow. The keepers of these 'bailes' were instructed to have horsemen ready to carry news of the invasion to the next beacon if it came in daylight. The towns of Lothian, the borders and Forth valley were ordered to ensure that all men between sixty and sixteen living in sight of the beacons were ready to respond to the signal.Hill Burton, John, ed., Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol.1 (1877), pp.73-75 An English invasion in September 1547 won a major encounter at the Battle of Pinkie close to Musselburgh, and put much of southern Scotland under military occupation.Paterson, pp. 195‚Äì198 Haddington was occupied, along with Broughty Castle near Dundee. Beginning on 5 April 1548, Sir Robert Bowes built a fort at Lauder.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (1898), 106, 108. Increased French support included the services of military engineers like Migliorino Ubaldini who strengthened Edinburgh Castle and Dunbar. At the command of Grey of Wilton, Musselburgh was burnt by the English on 9 June 1548 and Dunbar on 12 June. On 16 June 10,000 French troops arrived at Leith, and besieged Haddington with artillery.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (1898), 118, 119, 122, 132‚Äì133, Grey to Somerset.

Treaty of Boulogne The English abandoned Haddington on 19 September 1549. Hostilities ended with Scotland comprehended in the of 24 March 1550, which was primarily between France and England. Peace was declared in England on Saturday 29 March 1550; a week earlier the Privy Council had sent secret orders to English commanders telling them not to move cannon that would be abandoned to the Scots.John Roche Dasent, ed., Acts of the Privy Council, vol. 2 (London, 1890), pp. 416, 421. There were conditions to return prisoners and dismantle border fortifications. As part of the treaty six French and English hostages were to be exchanged on 7 April.

In August 1550, Regent Arran taxed forty of the chief trading burghs of Scotland to fund an embassy to Charles V. This treaty was concluded in Antwerp by Thomas, Master of Erskine on 1 May 1551.Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh, 1528‚Äì1557 (Edinburgh, 1871), p. 149: Ledger of Andrew Halyburton (Edinburgh, 1867), pp.lxxxv-lxxxvi, quoting a copy of the treaty from Edinburgh city archives (not in the published records). The Treaty of Norham in 1551 formally ended the war and the English military presence withdrew from Scotland.Paterson, pp. 202‚Äì204 By October 1551, Mary of Guise herself was welcomed in England and she travelled from Portsmouth to meet Edward VI in London.WK Jordan, (1966), 89‚Äì94: CSP Foreign: Edward VI (London, 1861), 190‚Äì1. Treaty of Norham The peace concluded at Norham Castle and church on 10 June 1551 was negotiated by Thomas Erskine, Master of Erskine, Lord Maxwell, Sir Robert Carnegy of Kinnaird, and Robert Reid, Bishop of Orkney with Louis St Gelais, Seigneur de Lansac, representing Henry II of France. The English delegation included Sir Robert Bowes, Sir Leonard Beckwith, Sir Thomas Challoner and Richard Sampson, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry.CSP Foreign Edward, (1861), 87. The terms included: the English abandoning their holdings in Scotland; the border and Debatable Lands to revert to original lines and usage; Edrington and fishing rights on the Tweed returned to Scotland; all captives, pledges, and hostages to be returned.Rhymer, Thomas ed., Foedera, vol. 15, (1704), 263‚Äì273. Edward VI ratified the treaty on 30 June and Mary on 14 August 1551.Ritchie, Pamela E., Mary of Guise, 1548‚Äì1560, Tuckwell (2002), 57‚Äì60. Propaganda war Sir John Luttrell, English commander at Inchcolm and Broughty Castle The English objective to forward a union between Scotland and England had wavering support among some sectors of the Scots population. These Scots may not have relished French domination of Scottish affairs or may have seen the alliance with England as furthering the Protestant cause. A number of books and pamphlets were published in England as propaganda to encourage such feelings. They focused on three aspects of the conflict: long-standing debates about the rights of the English crown in Scotland, the perceived injustice of the Scottish rejection of the Treaty of Greenwich and the merit of the Protestant religion. The English commander at Broughty, Andrew Dudley, hoped to distribute Bibles printed in English, which were not freely available in Scotland. Scotland countered the English propaganda with the Complaynt of Scotland, probably printed in France in 1549. Another work, Ane Resonyng by William Lamb, did not make it to the press. The first of these books was written before the Battle of Solway Moss: A Declaration, conteyning the iust causes and consyderations, of this present warre with the Scottis, wherein alsoo appereth the trewe & right title, that the kings most royall maiesty hath to the soveraynitie of Scotlande. A journal of Hertford's raid on Edinburgh of 1544 was printed as The Late expedicion of the Earl of Hertford into Scotland. A contribution by a Scot in England, John Elder, remained unpublished. It was intended to preface a detailed description and map of Scotland. Elder claimed that the northern lords of Scotland, who were 'red-shanks' of Irish descent would be loyal to Henry VIII, and reject the French culture imposed by Cardinal Beaton and the Scottish court.Elder, John, 'A Proposal for uniting Scotland and England' (1827), Bannatyne Miscellany, vol.1, (1827), pp. 1‚Äì18. (Elder later became the tutor of Lord Darnley.) Somerset began a new round in 1547 shortly before the Battle of Pinkie by publishing the Scot James Henrisoun's An Exhortacion to the Scottes to conforme themselfes to the honourable, Expedient & godly Union betweene the two realmes of Englande & Scotland. It was followed by Somerset's printed Proclamation of 4 September 1547, and the Epistle or Exhortation of February 1548. The Pinkie campaign was described by William Patten in The Expedition into Scotland of the most worthy Prince, Edward Duke of Somerset. A Welshman, Nicholas Bodrugan, added his Epitome of the title of the kynges majestie of Englande, which looks back to Geoffrey of Monmouth to justify English claims and seeks to reassure Scottish fears that the civil law of England was harsher than Scots law.Merriman, Marcus, The Rough Wooings, Tuckwell (2000), 265‚Äì291: These English pamphlets were reprinted in the EETS edition of the Complaynt of Scotlande, (1872) David Lindsay's poem The Tragedy of the Cardinal was published in London with an account of the death of George Wishart, with a preface encouraging religious reform by Robert Burrant.The Tragical Death of Dauid Beaton, Bishoppe of Sainct Andrewes in Scotland: whereunto is joyned the martyrdom of Maister George Wyseharte, John Day & William Seres, London (1548) In October 1548, Sir John Mason and other clerks were rewarded ¬£20 for their archival researches into \\"records of matters of Scotland\\" for these tracts.John Roche Dasent, ed., Acts of the Privy Council, vol. 2, HMSO (1890), 225. Lord Methven understood the effect of the English propaganda and raised his concern with Mary of Guise in June 1548.Cameron, Annie I., ed., The Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine, SHS (1927), 240‚Äì243. The Protestant Fife lairds who had killed David Beaton and held the Regent's son, James Hamilton hostage at St Andrews Castle gambled on English assistance. In East Lothian, three friends of the Protestant preacher George Wishart, John Cockburn of Ormiston, Ninian Cockburn, and Alexander Crichton of Brunstane lent their support to England. Lord Gray and the Master of Ruthven were also happy to deal with the English. Other Scots were induced to sign bonds and take payments from the English and became \\"assured men\\". A sample bond for assurance was drafted by a Scot, Henry Balnaves, at St Andrews Castle in December 1546. That mostly happened in the war zones of the border and around English garrisons. After the war ended, many Scots were accused of assurance or collaboration as a crime; 192 citizens of Dundee were acquitted in 1553, and the whole town of Dumfries received a pardon.Merriman, Marcus, The Rough Wooing, Tuckwell, (2000), 364. In July 1549 with English losses in France the assurance system ceased.Merriman, Marcus, The Rough Wooings, Tuckwell, (2000), 342. James Henrisoun then asked his English masters \\"Whether it were better to conquer hearts without charges, or burn, and build forts at great charges, which will never conquer Scotland?\\"Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (1898), 180, no. 357. At the end of the war, the French celebrated their successful intervention at f√™tes like the entry to Rouen. The details of these events were published in illustrated festival books. In England a number of the English commanders had their portraits painted celebrating their martial prowess, including John Luttrell, James Wilford, Thomas Wyndham, and a picture (now lost) was made to commemorate Edward Shelley who was killed at Pinkie.Cust, Lionel, 'The Painter HE', 2nd Annual Volume of the Walpole Society, Oxford (1913). Exploits during the siege of Haddington were later celebrated by the Elizabethan author Ulpian Fulwell in 1575.

It is situated at an altitude of 528 m. The present name of the site is from the chapel dedicated to Saint Ulrich of Augsburg which is found in the castle. Medieval texts never gave the present name - the castle had the name of the Rappolstein dynasty (or Ribeaupierre in the French style). History From the 11th to the 16th centuries, the castle was the principal residence of the powerful lords of Ribeaupierre. There must have been another castle on the same site which belonged in 1114 to the Bishop of Basle. It was occupied militarily by Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor, who used it as a strongpoint in his war against the Eguisheims. It was then returned to the Bishop of Basle who restored it to the Ribeaupierres. Anselme II de Ribeaupierre, who chased the other members of the family from the castle, successfully survived two sieges, in 1287 by Rudolph I of Germany and, in 1293, his successor Adolf. A celebrated crimal, Dame Cun√©gonde d'Hungersheim, was incarcerated in the keep and tried to escape with the aid of a guard. The castle is a very fine example of the military architecture of Alsace in the Middle Ages, including a keep erected in the 12th century and a residence with chimney of the 12th century. In the 13th century, the salle des chevaliers (knights' hall) was decorated with nine beautiful windows in the Romanesque style which can still be seen. In the same period (1435), the chapel dedicated to Saint Ulrich, Bishop of Augsburg, was built. The Ribeaupierre family left this castle in the 16th century for a Renaissance-style mansion (the present school in Ribeauvill√©). The castle was dismantled during the Thirty Years' War.  The castle today  The visible remains date from several epochs: * 12th century : Square keep and the corps de logis * 13th century : Salle des chevaliers, and the residential tower * 14th century : Barbican and outer enceinte * 15th century: Chapel (Saint- Ulrich) The Ch√¢teau de Saint-Ulrich has been listed since 1841 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.

They had arranged a signal: the first to wake would fire an arrow at the other's shutters. The Saint- Ulrich brother awoke first and shot an arrow towards his brother's shutters. But the latter, at the moment the arrow arrived, opened his shutters. He died, his heart pierced.

One of his contributions was to bring TNT into use as an explosive for Royal Navy ordnance, thus following a practice that was already well known in Germany. In 1906 he left the institute, and in 1907 founded the Silberrad Research Laboratories, first at 22 Stag Lane, Buckhurst Hill, and later moved to Loughton, where he had a special laboratory block added to his new house. As a consulting chemist, he mainly focused on the study of explosives. He also developed a new alloy, solving the problem of the erosion of warships' bronze propellers. In 1921 he campaigned unsuccessfully for a position at the Royal Society. Silberrad is buried at the parish church in Loughton. His home, Dryad's Hall, became that of barrister John Silberrad, and, on his death, was sold out of the family in 2005.

History World War I Organized in France in April 1918, the Photographic Section No. 1 processed aerial photographs taken by flying units working with the I Corps (American) and the French 38th Army Corps, 5 April‚ÄìNovember 1918. Inter-war years The 1st Photographic Section, from September 1919 until becoming the 3d Observation Squadron on 1 June 1937, processed aerial photography of associated observation squadrons in Texas. World War II At Langley Field, Virginia, the squadron engaged in aerial observation work with the Coast Artillery School until April 1942. It supported ground forces on maneuvers during 1942, and served as a training and demonstration unit January 1943 ‚Äì February 1944. The squadron was not manned or equipped, 1 Mar ‚Äì 2 July 1944. Strategic Reconnaissance Activated again in May 1952 under Strategic Air Command as part of its global reconnaissance mission. The squadron did not receive its first aircraft until 1 July 1953, when it immediately began familiarization training, followed by in-flight refueling training in February 1954. It received Boeing RB-47E Stratojet aircraft in March 1954, and conducted its first long-range mission (6 planes to Alaska for 10 days) in May 1954. The squadron deployed at RAF Upper Heyford, England, 14 September ‚Äì 3 November 1954. Some of these flights were mounted from Thule in Greenland and probed deep into the heart of the Soviet Union, taking a photographic and radar recording of the route attacking SAC bombers would follow to reach their targets. Flights which involved penetrating mainland Russia were termed SENSINT (Sensitive Intelligence) missions. One RB-47 even managed to fly 450 miles inland and photograph the city of Igarka in Siberia. It photographed numerous Air Force bases and American cities, 1954‚Äì1958, and participated regularly in SAC exercises. Missions flown on a reduced scale after February 1958 when events showed the vulnerability of the RB-47 to Soviet air defenses and the development of the U-2 aircraft. Became non-operational, 15 April ‚Äì 1 July 1958. when it inactivated. Vietnam War As the 3d Air Commando Squadron in South Vietnam, it absorbed resources of the 14th Air Commando Squadron. It flew combat missions in Douglas AC-47D gunships in close air support of ground forces, providing flare illumination and gunfire in support of strategic hamlets, out¬¨posts, and friendly forces under night attack. From 16 February ‚Äì 1 May 1969, all squadron aircraft were maintained on ground alert when not flying, due to the Tet (New Year) offensive. It began transferring its gunships to the Vietnamese Air Force in June 1969 and flew its last mission on 7 August 1969. Electronic warfare training The 3d Tactical Electronic Warfare Training Squadron was not equipped with aircraft. Rather, it operated Camp O'Donnell, Philippines, the Pacific Air Forces Electronic Warfare Range, the Crowe Valley Aerial Gunnery Range, and associated facilities. It provided realistic conventional, tactical, and electronic warfare training in a simulated combat environment during Cope Thunder exercises. These exercises provided combat training for fighter aircrews of not only the US Air Force, but also fighter crews of the US Marine Corps, US Navy, and allied air forces in the western Pacific area. Following the eruption of Mt Pinatubo in June 1991, personnel were evacuated, and the squadron remained unmanned until its inactivation.

Life Early life Yiwu was one of the nine sons of Duke Xian. His mother was Xiao Rongzi. He was the younger sibling of Shensheng and Chong'er (later Duke Wen) and the older sibling of Xiqi. As part of her scheme to secure the succession to her son, the concubine Li Ji removed Xiqi's older siblings from the capital on the pretext of pacifying their territories. Prince Yiwu was sent to defend Erqu in what is now Ji County, Shanxi. After the death of Duke Xian in the ninth lunar month during 651, Li Ji placed the 15-year-old Xiqi on the throne and made Xun Xi chancellor to help him with administration. In the tenth lunar month of 651, before Duke Xian had even been properly buried, a Jin minister named Li Ke killed Xiqi. The chancellor Xun Xi then placed Zhuozi, the youngest son of Duke Xian, on the throne even though he was still just a toddler at that time. Xun Xi then finished the burial of Duke Xian. In the eleventh lunar month of 651, Li Ke killed Zhuozi and his aunt Li Ji. Xun Xi then committed suicide by hanging himself. Shao Ji the younger sister of Li Ji and mother of Zhuozi, was imprisoned. Li Ke first invited Prince Chong'er (then in the State of Qi) to return to Jin to become the next duke. After Chong'er declined, Li Ke extended the same offer to his younger brother Prince Yiwu, then in the State of Liang. Yiwu accepted and was enthroned as the next duke of Jin. As duke As duke, Yiwu sentenced Li Ke to commit suicide to atone for his role in the deaths of his two predecessors. In the fourth year of his reign (647), Jin experienced a famine and requested that the State of Qin sell some of its grain. Duke Mu of Qin agreed and sold the grain to Jin. In the fifth year of his reign (646), Qin experienced a famine but Yiwu refused to sell any grain to them, despite its assistance the year before and the advice of the minister Qing Zheng . Enraged, Duke Mu invaded Jin's territory in Han. Prior to battle, Yiwu refused to let Qing Zheng drive his chariot. When it became stuck in the mud during the battle, Yiwu then demanded that Qing Zheng help him; instead, the minister simply walked away. Liang Yao then attempted to free the chariot while Guo She protected the duke, even attacking Duke Mu. In the end, the Jin troops fled in retreat and Yiwu was captured and taken as a captive back to Qin. On the day that he was to be killed as an offering to the gods, his half-sister Bo Ji wept and wore mourning clothes. Her husband Duke Mu admonished her and told her that the capture of the enemy of their state should be celebrated. He then repeated a story he had heard that the famous politician Jizi had once praised the Jin patriarch Shu Yu, saying that his descendants would thrive and be prosperous. He agreed to spare Yiwu's life, escorting him back to Jin and forming an alliance with Jin in the eleventh lunar month. Restored to power, Yiwu immediately killed Qing Zheng and reordered the government of Jin. Because many of his ministers held his older brother in affection and were open to the idea of a change in leadership, Yiwu sent assassins to the Di tribe of the northern Rong to kill him. Prince Chong'er and his attendants heard about this, however, and escaped to Qi. In the eighth year of his reign (643), he sent his son Crown Prince Yu to Qin as a hostage. In 641, Duke Mu invaded Liang, the small state which had once sheltered Yiwu. The count had been attempting to massively fortify his capital but construction was not complete, his people were tired and dissatisfied from their forced work, and Qin was able to conquer them easily. In the thirteenth year of his reign (638), Yiwu grew gravely ill. Crown Prince Yu and his wife Huai Ying heard of this and fled their captivity in Qin, arriving in Jin before the duke had died. In the ninth lunar month of the fourteenth year of his reign (637), Yiwu died and was posthumously entitled Duke Hui of Jin (\\"The Benevolent Duke of Jin\\"). Crown Prince Yu ascended the throne, later becoming known as Duke Huai.

The Labour Party had been previously unsuccessful in establishing any central Labour club, in London; earlier attempts by Arthur Henderson, and Herbert Morrison had failed.Owen 2007, p. 41. Also established by Webb, the Parliamentary Labour Club was opened in May 1924, with donations from Liberal Sir Arthur Acland and wealthy Labour Party members. The Club struggled to attract members; few Labour MPs or trade unionists joined.Owen 2007, pp. 41‚Äì42. The Club changed its name to the National Labour Club in 1928. In 1930, Webb wrote about the membership of the Club in her diary, remarking that one could find \\"short-haired typists from the trade union offices, M.P.s, Cabinet Ministers, all being served in strict order to their coming, and all chatting together indiscriminately\\".

Biography Born Martha B. Links in Oakland, California, she moved with her family to San Francisco, where she grew up. For six months she attended San Francisco's Fashion Art Institute, her only art training, and then began painting murals in the teenage departments of San Francisco department stores--the Emporium, the City of Paris and O'Connor Moffat. In 1940, she arrived at the San Francisco Chronicle where she drew for the \\"Women's World\\" department. Comic strips After landing an assignment to create fashion drawings for a major advertising campaign, she delivered her artwork to an ad agency account executive, who rejected the drawings and said, \\"This isn't what we want. These kids look more like bobby-soxers.\\" The reaction gave her the idea for a cartoon character, and in 1944, she launched her comic strip Bobby Sox about a teenager named Mimi. It was distributed by Consolidated News Features. The Chronicle described Mimi as a \\"precocious sub-deb with a flair for trouble.\\" Chronicle writer Carl Nolte noted the role of Links and her husband in San Francisco history: :Mimi, who had a pug nose and a short skirt, was a somewhat older version of Emmy Lou, the gawky teenager who could have been her younger sister. By 1946, Marty Links had drawn over 600 cartoons for the Chronicle, mostly about teenagers, had signed up with a syndicate and was a local celebrity. In the meantime, she had married Alexander Arguello, her high school sweetheart. He was a descendant of Jose Dario Arguello, a Spanish army officer who was commandant of the Presidio of San Francisco and a governor of Alta California. Jose's son was Luis Arguello, also commandant of the Presidio and a governor of California in the Mexican era. Arguello Boulevard in San Francisco and Point Arguello on the Southern California coast are named for the family. Alexander Arguello died in 1966 after the couple had been married for 25 years. Bobby Sox becomes Emmy Lou Marty Links' Emmy Lou (November 14, 1966): \\"I suppose it's called 'mad money' because fathers always get so mad when you ask for some!\\" As the footgear fashions of the 1940s became passe, the title Bobby Sox became outdated, so Links changed it to Emmy Lou, as noted by comics historian Don Markstein: :If you happen to be confused by the given name of the cartoonist, you're not alone. So, apparently, was the National Cartoonists Society, of which she was one of the first female members. Correspondence from the Society was addressed to \\"Mr. Marty Links\\" even after she'd given birth to her first child. She offered to send them her bust size. Like most slang describing teenagers, \\"Bobby Sox\\" was destined eventually to sound quaint. In 1951, when the term was still a couple of years away from the dustbin of history, Links renamed the feature after its star, Emmy Lou. Unencumbered by obsolescent expressions, she and her boyfriend, Alvin, continued in the same vein for decades.Emmy Lou at Don Markstein's Toonopedia Links had three children, and her daughters served as models for Emmy Lou. In 1954, Links lived at 215 32nd Avenue in San Francisco. In 1957, she described her working methods: :When I first started with the syndicate, I drew only daily panels. After we sold to a few papers, they asked for a Sunday page. This was impossible to handle alone, so Jerry Bundsen and Ted Martine came into my life. Jerry, who works for The San Francisco Examiner with Herb Caen, the columnist, has been writing my daily gags for 11 years. Once a week, he sends me a large batch of gags from which I select what I want and like. If there aren't enough to make up a week, I fill out with my own ideas--which drives Jerry mad! He claims if he sent me 60 gags I would be unable psychologically to select more than four out of the bunch. This isn't so at all. After selecting the four best gags, I pencil in the whole week of dailies. These go to Ted Martine, the world's best artist. (I should be working for him.) He inks in all the pencilled backgrounds. When they are returned I ink in the figures. I have pencilled them in rough enough so that I change as I go along. This keeps the action loose and fresh. In addition, I draw from models constantly, then use the sketches as reference. With the outlines of the furniture inked, for instance, I add details like prints and upholstery, flowers in bowls, fringe on curtains, etc. My husband claims I can't stand a plain white space. But it's this detail which gives a homey touch. As a matter of fact I draw all the furniture in our home. I often think I'd like to recover the worn up holstery in a Popsicle-colored background so the Popsicle stains will not show. As to the Sunday panels, these I dream up myself, and it is more work than everything else put together. I feel each idea is the last one I'll ever be able to eke out. Also I meditate (or should I say brood?) on my own girlhood, which was a long time ago, believe me. But once the mind starts going back, it's amazing how much it remembers.Links, Marty. \\"Post Strips\\", The Cartoonist, Summer, 1957. The pilot for a proposed series based on Emmy Lou aired as a second-season episode of Mister Ed. The role of Emmy Lou was played by Noanna Dix. Her parents were played by George O'Hanlon and Jeff Donnell. By the time her children became adults, Links felt the strip no longer represented teens, as she told columnist Caen, \\"Everything I know about teenagers today is unprintable.\\" Thus, she brought Emmy Lou to an end in December 1979. Hallmark She then began doing ceramic sculptures and working for Hallmark as an illustrator of greeting cards, developing a group of child characters for a series called Kidlinks. At age 82, she retired from Hallmark. During the 1990s, she lived at 64 Manzanita Way in San Francisco. She continued to do watercolor paintings until the last year of her life. She died on a Sunday, January 6, 2008, of heart failure at a San Rafael assisted living facility. She was survived by two daughters, Victoria Arguello of San Rafael, and Elizabeth Arguello of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and by six grandchildren.

Part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes, it is part of the Altiplano- Puna volcanic complex, a major caldera and silicic ignimbrite volcanic field. This volcanic field is located in remote regions at the Zapaleri tripoint between Chile, Bolivia and Argentina. La Pacana along with other regional volcanoes was formed by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate in the Peru-Chile Trench. La Pacana is situated in a basement formed by various Paleozoic formations and Tertiary ignimbrites and volcanoes. Several major faults cross the region at La Pacana and have influenced its volcanic activity. La Pacana is a supervolcano and is responsible for the eruption of the giant Atana ignimbrite, which reaches a volume of and constitutes the fifth-largest explosive eruption known. The Atana ignimbrite was erupted 3.8 ¬± 0.1 and 4.2 ¬± 0.1 million years ago, almost simultaneously with the much smaller (volume of ) Toconao ignimbrite. The Pujsa ignimbrite was erupted by La Pacana before the Atana/Toconao ignimbrites, and the Filo Delgado and Pampa Chamaca/Talabre ignimbrites afterwards.  Geography and structure  La Pacana lies in the Antofagasta Region of Chile, in the Andes just north of the Tropic of Capricorn. The border between Chile and Bolivia crosses the northern sector of the caldera. The area of La Pacana is largely uninhabitated; small settlements such as Socaire, Talabre and Toconao exist close to the Salar de Atacama, where streams descend the mountain slopes to the salar. The caldera was discovered during mapping efforts in the region between 1980‚Äì1985. La Pacana is part of the Central Volcanic Zone, one of the four volcanic zones that make up the Andean Volcanic Belt and which are separated from each other by gaps without ongoing volcanic activity. A number of stratovolcanoes and ignimbrite-forming centres have erupted in the Central Volcanic Zone since the Miocene, about 50 of which are considered to be active. In addition, the Central Volcanic Zone features about 18 minor volcanic fields. The largest historical eruption of the Andes occurred in 1600 at Huaynaputina in Peru in the Central Volcanic Zone, and the most active volcano of the Central Volcanic Zone is L√°scar in Chile. La Pacana has a diameter of with a north-south elongation. This is one of the best exposed and largest calderas in the world; the largest caldera known is Toba in Sumatra with a maximum length of . La Pacana might not be a single caldera; some reconstructions imply that the northern parts of the caldera are actually a separate collapse structure. The floor of the caldera lies at an elevation of , the central uplift and the caldera rim are higher and reach . The caldera rim is well exposed except in the northern and western sides, where later volcanism has buried it. After the formation of the caldera, sediments and tuffs within the caldera were uplifted over an angular area of , forming the high resurgent dome known as Cord√≥n La Pacana. This resurgent dome is cut by numerous faults and features a poorly developed graben on its summit. Originally it was believed that the present-day calder rim did not coincide with the caldera ring fault, which was instead identified to coincide with margins of the resurgent dome; later research however indicates the present- day topographic margin as the caldera edge. The resurgent dome is separated from the caldera rim by a wide moat that makes up about two thirds of the entire surface of the caldera, but is interrupted on the northern side of the caldera by the \\"hinge\\" of the caldera collapse, which assumed the form of a trap-door. The moat is filled by sediments formed by erosion and by alluvial, evaporite and lacustrine sediments left behind by lakes. The Guayaques volcanic group The collapse of the caldera cut through older volcanic centres, exposing the Ceja Alta and Quilapana porphyry deposits. Other older volcanic centres exposed in the walls of the caldera are the Cerro Aguas Calientes stratovolcano in the eastern wall and the Cerro Gigantes in the western wall. Volcanic activity resumed within the caldera and at the edge of the resurgent dome, forming lava domes between 4.1 and at least 1.6 million years ago. These volcanic centres include the Corral de Coquena crater and the lava domes of Morro Negro east, Cerro Bola and Purifican west and Cerros de Guayaques north of the resurgent dome. The Arenoso, Chamaca and Chivato Muerto lava domes in the southern wall of the caldera were originally considered to be pre-caldera; later these three domes were identified as post-caldera domes. Stratovolcanoes inside the caldera include the cones associated with the Cerros de Guayaques lava domes and the volcanoes Cerro Incaguasi, Cerros de Pili, Cerros Negros and Huailitas. Some extant hot springs within the caldera may indicate that there is still a geothermal system associated with La Pacana, although not a very important one considering their low temperature (less than ). A few lakes such as the spring-fed Laguna de Chivato Muerto, Laguna Trinchera and Ojos del Ri√≥ Salado, as well as salt pans such as Salar de Aguas Calientes Norte, Salar de Aguas Calientes Sur, Salar de Pujsa and Salar de Quisquiro have developed within the moat. Streams such as R√≠o de Pili and R√≠o Salado complete the hydrology of the caldera. Gravimetric observations have been conducted on La Pacana. A large negative anomaly (an anomaly with less-than-expected mass crust) coincides with the surface of the La Pacana caldera and extends past its borders; it may be a consequence of the caldera being infilled with low- density material. Positive anomalies (anomalies with more-than-expected mass in the crust) are found in the areas surrounding the caldera and dot discrete zones within it; the former represent the dense basement and the latter may be intrusions associated with individual vents.  Geology  In the Peru-Chile Trench, the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South American Plate at a rate of about , leading to volcanic activity at distances of from the trench. Research indicates that subduction has been ongoing since the Jurassic 200 million years ago but accelerated 26 million years ago. After a phase of andesitic volcanism lasting from the late Tertiary to the Miocene, large scale ignimbritic volcanism commenced about 23 million years ago and is still ongoing. It began north of 21¬∞ southern latitude with the 23-18 million years old Oxaya formation and the 15‚Äì17 million years old Altos de Pica formation. Later the San Bartolo and Silapeti groups were generated, ending by the early Pleistocene. Volcanic activity at La Pacana is more recent than elsewhere in the region, with the oldest volcanic rocks that crop out in La Pacana being between 11 and 7.5 million years old. Large scale ignimbritic activity continued until 2 million years ago.  Regional  The Central Andes are the site of extensive ignimbrites that were erupted from large calderas usually located within the adjacent Altiplano, east of the principal volcanic arc. Many of these calderas are part of the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex, a large volcanic complex covering a surface area of with about of ignimbrites. La Pacana is the largest caldera of the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex. The ignimbrites form a surface that lies at an average elevation of . Stratovolcanoes developed on top of these ignimbrite sheets and today form the most clear expression of volcanic activity in the region, with some of them exceeding the height of above sea level. The long-lasting dry climate means that traces of volcanic activity can be recognizable over long timeframes. The Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex is underpinned by a large seismic velocity anomaly at a depth of , which may be the largest structure consisting of near- molten (10‚Äì20%) rock on Earth. This partial melt zone was formed by the injection of mafic magmas into the lower crust; a major episode of overturning before 10.6 million years ago caused crustal anatexis and started the onset of ignimbritic volcanism. Magmas formed within this melt zone rose into the upper crust and differentiated between depths of to form the ignimbrite-forming secondary magmas. Presently, the inferred margin of this partially molten zone coincides fairly well with a negative gravimetric anomaly that clusters around the tripoint between Argentina, Bolivia and Chile and with the extent of the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex.  Local  The basement beneath La Pacana is formed by sediments of Ordovician age, Devonian-Permian quartzites, the mixed Salta formation also of Permian age and sediments of Cretaceous-Tertiary age. At the eastern margin of La Pacana in Argentina, they overlay an even older Precambrian basement. Most of this original basement however is covered by Miocene ignimbrites from centres that may coincide with the La Pacana caldera. Two of these older ignimbrites are known as the Pampa M√∫car and Antigua Chacaliri ignimbrites. La Pacana together with the Cerro Guacha and Purico Complex calderas forms the La Pacana Complex. Guacha experienced two major eruptions, of which one occurred 4.1 million years ago. The Purico complex began erupting 1.3 million years ago; it is the youngest centre of the La Pacana Complex with the youngest eruptions occurring during the Holocene. Additional volcanic centres west and southwest of La Pacana are Acamarachi, L√°scar, Colachi and Cord√≥n de Puntas Negras. A number of faults transect the region at La Pacana, including the north-south Miscanti Lineament and the Socompa and Quisiquiro lineaments. These lineaments or faults have influenced volcanism and geomorphology in the region, with volcanoes and vents aligning along these lineaments.  Composition  The Toconao and Atana ignimbrites are formed by rhyolite and dacite-rhyodacite, respectively. They form a potassium-rich calc-alkaline suite. Both contain pumices, three different types of which are found in the Atana ignimbrite. Phenocrysts within the ignimbrite are chiefly formed by plagioclase. Both the Atana and the Toconao ignimbrite include minerals like allanite, apatite, biotite, epidote, hornblende, ilmenite, magnetite, monazite, orthopyroxene, plagioclase, quartz, sanidine, titanite and zircon. Not all of these minerals are found in both ignimbrites, and not always in the same phase (crystals or matrix). Ultimately, the magmas at La Pacana are the products of mantle melts interacting with various crustal domains deep in the crust, within the partially molten zone that has been found at depths of beneath the Altiplano- Puna volcanic complex. Various geothermometers indicate that the Toconao ignimbrite was colder than the Atana ignimbrite; temperatures have been estimated at and respectively. While the depth at which the Toconao ignimbrite formed is unknown, the Atana ignimbrite formed at a depth of . Such a formation depth is comparable to depths estimated for other magmatic systems such as Fish Canyon, Long Valley and Yellowstone.  Climate and biota  Weather records are available for the Salar de Aguas Calientes. There, an average temperature of and average precipitation of have been recorded. There is little vegetation in the dry Altiplano. Nevertheless a number of animal species are found, such as Andean moles, rheas, vicu√±as and vizcachas. Ducks, geese and flamingos frequent waterbodies and salars.  Eruption history  La Pacana has erupted two ignimbrites which differ in composition and were emplaced one shortly after the other: The dacitic Atana ignimbrite and the rhyolitic Toconao ignimbrite. The Atana ignimbrite was once considered part of the Guaitiquina ignimbrite, which was later split off, while the Puripicar ignimbrite may be correlated with the Atana instead. Also, some of the ignimbrites erupted by La Pacana originally were attributed to Cerro Guacha. Both ignimbrites originated from different parts of the same magma chamber and their origin in the La Pacana caldera is established by isotope ratios of the rocks and the geographical distribution of their outcrops. Before the eruption of the Toconao and Atana ignimbrites, early activity generated the Pujsa ignimbrite between 5.8 ¬± 0.1 and 5.7 ¬± 0.4 million years ago and some stratovolcanoes and porphyries that are cut by the caldera walls. The Pujsa ignimbrite resembles the Atana ignimbrite and like the Toconao ignimbrite is mainly exposed on the western side of the caldera. The first large eruption, which took place between 4 ¬± 0.9 and 5.3 ¬± 1.1 million years ago, formed the Toconao ignimbrite. The Toconao ignimbrite crops out mainly west of the caldera; only later were units of the Toconao identified on the eastern side of La Pacana. This ignimbrite has a volume of approximately and is formed by a lower un-indurated and an upper indurated subunit. Tube pumices are contained in the lower subunit and in a less than Plinian deposit that was emplaced beneath the Toconao ignimbrite. The formation of the caldera coincided with the eruption of the Atana ignimbrite; the eruption was still underway when the terrain subsided to a depth of beneath the previous surface in the northwestern segment of La Pacana. Dates obtained on the Atana ignimbrite are between 3.8 ¬± 0.1 and 4.2 ¬± 0.1 million years ago, which is not clearly distinguishable from the dates of the Toconao ignimbrite seeing as there is no indication that a pause occurred between the eruption of the two ignimbrites. This ignimbrite is considerably larger than the Toconao ignimbrite, reaching a volume of and a volcanic explosivity index of 8. This makes the Atana eruption the fifth-largest explosive eruption known and La Pacana a supervolcano. The Atana ignimbrite forms a flow sheet that extends from within the caldera to the outside in the form of a thick structure. This flow sheet originally probably covered a surface area of about , part of which was later eroded away. The Atana ignimbrite is fairly welded, rich in crystals and poor in lithics. It is underlaid by pumice and ash deposits. Pumice is also found as fragments within the ignimbrite, ranging from white rhyolite to gray andesite. After its eruption, wind and water driven erosion occurred on the Atana ignimbrite, carving valleys and yardangs into it. Some differences exist between the facies of the ignimbrite inside and outside of the caldera, as well as between the western and eastern outcrops. Such differences concern the degree of welding of the ignimbrite, the occurrence or absence of devitrification and the jointing patterns. In fact, a segment of the northern Atana ignimbrite was later considered to not be actually part of the Atana ignimbrite at all because of the different facies and petrology. This separate ignimbrite was christened to be an upper and a lower Tara ignimbrite, possibly erupted by the Cerro Guacha caldera. The Tara ignimbrite fills part of the La Pacana caldera. The total volume of the La Pacana ignimbrites proper is estimated to be about , on the basis of gravimetric information about the volume of the caldera and the infill ignimbrites. The most likely theory for the origin of both Atana and Toconao ignimbrites is that they formed by crystal fractionation within a magma chamber, where the Toconao magma was extracted from convecting dacitic magma that was undergoing crystallization. This volatile-rich and crystal-poor extracted magma erupted first as a Plinian eruption. Then a tectonic event, most likely a movement along a fault cutting through the caldera, prompted the rise and eruption of the Atana ignimbrite. Two potential vents have been found at the northern and western margins of the caldera, where breccia deposits occur within the Atana ignimbrite. Some of the magma that gave rise to the Atana ignimbrite was erupted after the ignimbrite; the lava domes formed after the caldera collapse were generated by this magma. This category of dependent postcaldera volcanism includes Corral de Coquena and Morro Negro; other postcaldera volcanic centres have different compositions and thus probably formed from different sources than the Atana magma. Ignimbrite eruptions continued after the formation of the caldera. The Filo Delgado ignimbrite was erupted at some time during the Pliocene from the Huailitas volcano. Its volume is about . 2.4 ¬± 0.4 million years ago, the Pampa Chamaca ignimbrite filled the moat between the resurgent dome and the caldera rim. The Pampa Chamaca or Talabre ignimbrite was erupted from a vent probably buried beneath the present-day Cordon de Puntas Negras or the Salar de Aguas Calientes and reached a volume of about .

Dedicated to St Mary and St John the Baptist, the chapel was largely completed in its present form by the end of the 13th century. The building retains a number of original stained glass windows, and is noted for its acoustics. A choral foundation was established in 2008 by Peter Phillips. History 13th century origins On 13 September 1266 the church of St John the Baptist was granted to the scholars of Merton College by the Abbey of Reading.Henderson, Bernard William, p.26, Merton College, (1899). Retrieved 9 February 2010 However, by the late 1280s it had fallen into \\"a ruinous condition\\",Anthony Wood, quoted in Bott, p.24 and Merton college accounts show that work on a new church on the same site began in about 1290. The present choir with its enormous east window was complete by 1294. The window is an important example (because it is so well dated) of how the strict geometrical conventions of the Early English Period of architecture were beginning to be relaxed at the end of the 13th century.Pevsner, p.25 Unusually for an English religious building, much medieval glass survives intact. Of the seven pairs of windows in the side walls of the Quire, twelve retain original 13th century glass, set in Decorated tracery. The glass was donated to the Chapel sometime between 1289 and 1296 by Henry Mansfield. The scene of the Annunciation in the East Window also dates from the late 13th century. 14th century The south transept was built in the 14th century, the north transept in the early years of the 15th century. The great tower was complete by 1450. The chapel replaced the parish church of St. John and continued to serve as the parish church as well as the chapel until 1891. Because of this, it is generally referred to as Merton Church in older documents, and there is a north door into the street as well as doors into the college. This dual role also probably explains the enormous scale of the chapel, which in its original design was to have a nave and two aisles extending to the west.See Bott, pp.24‚Äì37 16th century and Reformation Merton College Chapel in 2017 In the early 16th century, the college appears to have abandoned plans to extend the chapel, as the land on which the nave would have been built was leased in 1517 to Richard Foxe (c. 1448‚Äì1528), Bishop of Winchester, founder of Corpus Christi College, next door to Merton.History of Merton College Chapel. Retrieved 16 July 2020. The lecturn, one of the finest examples of its kind, dates from the pre-Reformation era; it was a gift from John Martock in 1504. The Reformation did not leave Merton Chapel untouched. During the reign of the zealously Protestant Edward VI (1547‚Äì1553), traditional forms of worship began to change, and it was most likely at this time that the medieval stained glass was removed or hidden. The glass in the chancel windows, for example, was protected by being boarded over and whitewashed.Highfield, p.150 The wall paintings behind the stalls were also saved at this time, though they would not survive the next century, being destroyed in 1651 \\"to the sorrow of curious men that were admirers of ancient painting\\". The Edwardian reforms also saw the removal from the Chapel of the traditional service books, vestments, furnishings, and images, all considered offensive to the new religion. King Edward died young, and during the reign of his sister Mary I (1553‚Äì1558) Catholicism was restored, and enthusiastically embraced by the college. Soon afterwards, under Elizabeth I, Protestantism was once again enforced and Merton College found itself facing a siege by Elizabeth's Archbishop of Canterbury, Matthew Parker, for three weeks, in defence of the old religion. 17th century The church was in a bad physical state by the 17th century. We do not know when the Medieval glass of the transepts and the lower part of the Great East Window were broken, but this seems to have taken place between 1646 and 1655. Highfield, p.211 In any event, by 1634 the building was in considerable disrepair, and the decision was taken to replace the medieval floor tiles with black and white marble. Highfield, p.216In 1655 the roof of the South Transept roof collapsed, damaging many of the medieval monuments. This led to a number of rebuilding projects by architects including Christopher Wren and Edward Blore. In 1671 Wren was instructed to install a new screen at the then considerable cost of ¬£1,130, as well as stalls carved in the classical style. 20th century During World War II the ancient stained glass was removed from the chapel windows to protect it from enemy bombs; the glass was stored in a vault under the New Bodleian Library.Highfield, p.341 On 23 January 1967 Fr Michael Hollings celebrated the first Roman Catholic Mass to have been held in the chapel since the Reformation.

The College Choir consists of twenty-eight singers, of whom eighteen are choral scholars; there are also two organ scholars. The choir has toured in France (2009 and 2010), in the USA (2011) and in Sweden (2013) and features prominently during Merton's annual festival Passiontide at Merton. The choir's repertoire includes a number of pieces written for it by Howard Skempton, Gabriel Jackson and John Tavener. The college celebrated its 750th anniversary in 2014, when the Merton Choirbook was premiered. The College also recently commissioned a new organ to be installed, to coincide with the anniversary celebrations. The organ was built by Dobson Pipe Organ Builders from Lake City, Iowa and arrived in August 2013. It was officially opened at the Organ Festival weekend in April 2014. A spire from the chapel has resided in Pavilion Garden VI of the University of Virginia since 1928, when \\"it was given to the University to honor Jefferson's educational ideals\\".

Aiming for compatibility, it supports standard BIOS features and calling interfaces that are implemented by a typical proprietary x86 BIOS. SeaBIOS can either run on bare hardware as a coreboot payload, or can be used directly in emulators such as QEMU and Bochs. Initially, SeaBIOS was based on the open-source BIOS implementation included with the Bochs emulator. The project was created with intentions to allow native usage on x86 hardware, and to be based on an improved and more easily extendable internal source code implementation.  Features  Features supported by SeaBIOS include the following: * Graphical bootsplash screen (JPEG and BMP) * USB keyboard and mouse support * USB drive booting support * Boot from USB Attached SCSI * Support for 32-bit PCI BIOS calls * ATA DMA and bus mastering support * Support Universal Host Controller Interface (UHCI), Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI), Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI), and Extensible Host Controller Interface (xHCI) * Support systems with multiple VGA cards * Boot menu that allow booting from any drive or any CD-ROM (El Torito) * BIOS Boot Specification (BBS) calls * Rebooting on Control-Alt- Delete key press * Dynamic e820 map generation * Logical block addressing (LBA) 48-bit * POST Memory Manager (PMM) * Paravirtualization, Xen HVM, Virtio * Payloads (LZMA compressed) * VESA BIOS Extensions (VBE) 3.0 * PCI Firmware Specification v3.0 * SeaBIOS as a Compatibility Support Module (CSM) for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) and Open Virtual Machine Firmware (OVMF) * Virtual machine host notification of paravirtualized guests which panic via the pvpanic driver * A patch exists to load the SLIC table from a licensed OEM Windows BIOS. * Trusted Platform Module hardware and BIOS calls SeaBIOS has support for APM 1.2 (limited), Enhanced Disk Drive (EDD) 3.0 (INT 13H extensions), SMBIOS 2.4, MultiProcessor Specification, BIOS Boot Specification (BBS) and ACPI. It does not support ESCD or PnP BIOS (other than parts needed for BBS). SeaBIOS's boot device selection menu can be accessed by pressing during the boot process.  Uses  SeaBIOS can run natively on x86 hardware, in which case it is loaded by coreboot as a payload; it runs on 386 and later processors, and requires a minimum of 1 MB of RAM. Compiled SeaBIOS images can be flashed into supported motherboards using flashrom. SeaBIOS also runs inside an emulator; it is the default BIOS for the QEMU and KVM virtualization environments, and can be used with the Bochs emulator. It is also included in some Chromebooks, although it is not used by the Chrome OS.  Development  Most of the SeaBIOS source code is written in C, with its build system relying on the standard GNU toolchain. SeaBIOS has been tested with various bootloaders and operating systems, including GNU GRUB, LILO, SYSLINUX, Microsoft Windows, Linux, FreeDOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD.

Palaeographically it has been assigned to the 13th century.K. Aland, M. Welte, B. K√∂ster, K. Junack, \\"Kurzgefasste Liste der griechischen Handschriften des Neues Testaments\\", Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, New York 1994, p. 83. The manuscript is lacunose. Tischendorf labelled it by 137a and 176p. According to some scholars, it is one of very few witnesses of the Western text-type with complete text of the Book of Acts.David Alan Black, New Testament Textual Criticism. A Concise Guide, Baker Books 2006, p. 65. But Robert Waltz categorizes it with the Harklean Family (Family 2138) in a subgroup with its close relative Minuscule 2412. The earliest representative of this family is the marginal readings of the seventh-century Harklean Syriac version.http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/Manuscripts501-1000.html#614  Description  The codex contains the text of the Acts of the Apostles, Catholic epistles, and Pauline epistles on 276 parchment leaves (size ), with only one lacuna (Jude 3-25). The text is written in one column per page, 23 lines per page.Handschriftenliste at the M√ºnster Institute It contains Prolegomena, lectionary markings at the margin, incipits, anagnoseis (lessons), subscriptions at the end, and stichoi. Synaxarion, Menologion, and liturgical notes were added by a later hand. It contains additional material Journeys and death of Paul (as 102, 206, 216, 256, 468, 665, 912), it was added by a later hand. The order of books: Acts, Pauline epistles, and Catholic epistles.

Text  The Greek text of the codex has been described as a representative of the Western text-type. Aland placed it in Category III. It is a sister manuscript to Minuscule 2412; they share slight variations of the Harklean marginal addition to Acts 18:21, Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºÄŒΩŒÆœáŒ∏Œ∑ ·ºÄœÄ·Ω∏ œÑ·øÜœÇ ·ºòœÜŒ≠œÉŒøœÖ, œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ Œ¥·Ω≤ ·ºàŒ∫œçŒªŒ±ŒΩ Œµ·º¥Œ±œÉŒµŒΩ ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜŒ≠œÉ·ø≥ (and he sailed from Ephesus, but left Aquila in Ephesus). In the Catholic epistles Aland placed it in Category V. The same text is found at the margin of the Book of Acts in Harklean Syriac. It has some the Caesarean readings in the Catholic epistles.K. W. Clark, Eight American Praxapostoloi (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1941) In Pauline epistles its text is almost pure the Byzantine text.Robert Waltz, Encyclopedia of New Testament Textual Criticism 2003, p. 230. Bruce M. Metzger noted: \\"It contains a large number of pre-Byzantine readings, many of them of the Western type of text.\\"Bruce M. Metzger, Bart D. Ehrman, \\"The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption and Restoration\\", Oxford University Press (New York - Oxford, 2005), p. 89. Clark and Riddle, who collated and published text of 2412, speculated that 614 might even have been copied from 2412. The text is similar to Codex Bezae and Codex Laudianus. It is important witness of the Western text in that parts of the Acts where these two manuscripts are mutilated, especially at the end, because they do not have ending parts (Codex Beae lacks Acts 22:29‚Äì28:31; Codex Laudianus ‚Äì Acts 26:29‚Äì28:26).Nestle-Aland, Novum Testamentum Graece, 26th edition, pp. 689-690.

Silvester was born in Tallinn, Estonia. He graduated from the Camegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie-Mellon University) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1956. After a period of industrial practice, he continued his studies at the University of Toronto, obtaining the MASc in 1958, and then at McGill University (Montreal), where he was awarded the PhD in Electrical Engineering, in 1964. He initially joined the Department of Electrical Engineering at McGill as Lecturer, then as Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Full Professor. In 1996, he was honored with the titles of emeritus professor at McGill University, and Honorary Professor at the University of British Columbia. Silvester devoted a large part of his career to the numerical analysis of electromagnetic field], with applications to magnetics, microwaves, geomagnetics, antennas, and bioelectricity. His main research focused on the finite element method, as applied to electromagnetics, where he was a pioneer. His paper, Finite-Element Solution of Homogeneous- Waveguide Problems, presented at the 1968 URSI Symposium on Electromagnetic Waves, and later on, published in the Italian technical journal, Alta Frequenza, was definitely the first FEM application to electronic engineering. In this field, his contributions were valuable, both from the theoretical and the applications side. He studied topics which ranged from potential and scalar-wave problems, in the first years, to applications to microwave devices, antennas, electric machines, as well as new kinds of elements and formulations, open-boundary problems, and parallel computing. His book, Finite Elements for Electrical Engineering, written with Ron Ferrari, has been the only textbook on this specific topic for many years, and it has been translated into many languages, among which are Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and Spanish. He founded the Computational Analysis and Design Laboratory (CAD- Lab) at the Electrical Engineering Department of McGill University, in 1978, which has now become probably the largest research organization of its kind in Canada, and one of the largest in the world. Peter Silvester also was a founder of Infolytica Corporation (Montreal), a consulting and engineering simulation software (computer-aided engineering, or CAE) company. Silvester maintained strong research ties with colleagues of several other institutions, notably the University of Cambridge and the University of Florence, creatively sharing his knowledge. He also acted as a consultant to a number of major corporations and government agencies. He was a member of major professional organizations in his field, a member of steering committees and boards of various scientific and professional conferences, and was elected a Fellow of the IEEE for \\"...contributions to the art of finite-element analysis.\\" He was also a Fellow of the IEE, and of the Royal Society of Canada. His archives are held at the McGill University Archives. Books * Peter P. Silvester, M. V. K. Chari, Finite Elements in Electrical and Magnetic Field Problems, John Wiley & Sons Inc, 1980. * Peter P.

He is worshipped as Shri Akrurji Maharaj by the present-day Varshney community and is also known as Babrhu.Garg, pp. 305-306. The life of Akrura is depicted in the ancient Indian texts known as the Puranas. Life Akrura Speaks to the Cowherds Akrura (whose name derives from the Sanskrit akrur, meaning \\"who is not cruel\\")http://www.naamkaran.com/babynames/meaning-of-akrur.html was one of twelve sons born to ≈övaphalka and GƒÅndinƒ´. ≈övaphalka was a son of PrsniPargiter, p. 107, 280. and GƒÅndinƒ´a was a daughter of the king of Kashi. Though sections of the relevant Puranas are missing, and remaining ones are unclear, there is a general recognition that a direct line of descent exists from Yadu through Krostu, Satvata, Vrishni, YudhƒÅjit and then to Prsni, ≈övaphalka and Akrura. In Vrishni, Akrura shared the same great-great- grandfather as Krishna.Pargiter, pp. 102-109. Akrura married Sutanu, who was the daughter of Ahuka, and with her had two sons, Devaka and Updevaka. He reigned at DvƒÅrakƒÅ and Pargiter believes that this was the family's chiefdom as far back as Vrishni.Pargiter, p. 280. Kamsa ruled over the area as king, being based in the capital at Mathura. Prophesied to be killed by The Lord Krishna, he ordered Akrura to go and invite the cowherd to Mathura. He ,thus, had a desire to see Krishna and Baladeva, his brother, killed. Kamsa was earlier witness to \\"akaash vani\\", a celestial announcement from the sky, suggesting that he would meet his end from the eighth of the Devaki's sons - Krishna. To achieve this end he ordered Akrura to bring them from Ambadi, where they were staying, on the pretext of an invitation to view a ceremony known as \\"worshipping the bow\\".Swami, p. 782. Akrura was given Syamantaka, a significant jewel in Hindu mythology, for safekeeping. Akrura in Hindu scriptures Akrura's Mystic Vision of Krishna, Bhagavata Purana ≈övaphalka, of the Vrsni dynasty, married Nandini, daughter of the king of Kasi, and Akrura was born to them. Akrura was an uncle of Krishna but is respected more as a worshipper of Krishna. He is mentioned in Hindu scriptures in the following ways. *He rose to fame as a commander of the Yadava army. (Chapter 220 of Adi Parva, Mahabharat). *Akrura was also present for the Swayamvara (wedding) of Draupadi. (Sloka 18, Chapter 185 of Adi Parva, Mahabharat). *At the time that Arjuna eloped with Subhadra, a grand festival was being held in the Raivataka mountain, which Akrura partook in (Sloka 10, Chapter 218, Adi Parva, Mahabharat). *Akrura accompanied Krishna to the marriage of Subhadra (Sloka 29, Chapter 220, Adi Parva, Mahabharat). *Akrura came to Upaplavya to attend the marriage of Abhimanyu. (Sloka 22, chapter 72, Virata Parva, Mahabharat). *Akrura and Ahuka always quarrelled with each other. Both accused the other of siding with the camp of Krishna (Sloka 9 to 11, Chapter 81, Santi Parva, Mahabharat). *Kamsa, who was planning to kill Balarama and Krishna, conducted a festival called Capapuja (worship of the bow). Akura was sent by Kamsa to bring Balarama and Krishna to the festival. Akrura saw through the plot, informed Krishna about it and advised him to kill Kamsa (Dasama Skandha, Bhagvata). *Akrura fought against Jarasandha, alongside Krishna (Dashama Skandha, Bhagvata). *On another occasion Krishna, Balarama and Uddhava sent Akura to Hastinapura to gather news about Kunti and the Pandavas. Akura met Vasudev's sister Kunti and the king of Hastinapura, Dhritarashtra, and talked to them, after which he returned to Dvaraka (Dashama Skandha, Bhagvata). *Akrura married Sutanu, daughter of Ahuka, and had two sons named Devaka and Upadevaka (Navama Skandha, Bhagvata). Shri Akrura Maharaj Temples Shree Akrura with Krishna and Balarama, Gopi Nath Temple Akrur Ghat Akrura Ghat is one of the bathing ghats at Vrindavan, Mathura district. This is the place where Lord Krishna and Lord Balarama are believed to have revealed their forms of Lord Vishnu and Sesha Naga to Akrura. The text Adi Varaha Purana illustrates Akrura Ghat as the king of all holy places. One of the major attractions is an ancient Gopi Nath temple dedicated to Krishna and Balarama. Akrura is depicted standing in between the two. It is believed that one can eradicate all his sins by bathing here during a full moon.

A member of the Conservative Party, Coffey has served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Suffolk Coastal since 2010. She retained her seat at the 2015, 2017 and 2019 general elections. Early life and career Coffey was born on 18 November 1971 in Billinge, Lancashire, and grew up in Liverpool. She attended St Mary's College, Crosby, St Edward's College, Liverpool, Somerville College, Oxford, and then University College London, where she was awarded a PhD in Chemistry in 1998. Coffey stood as Conservative Party candidate for the Wrexham constituency, in Wales, at the 2005 general election. She came third with 6,079 votes (20% of the vote). In the European Parliament elections in June 2004, Coffey stood for election to the European Parliament for the South East region of England. The Conservative Party won 35.2% of the vote, giving it four seats, but Coffey was seventh on the list in this proportional representation system, meaning that she failed to be elected. In 2009, at the next European elections, Coffey was living in Andover, Hampshire; she missed out by one place on being elected to the European Parliament for the South East region. The Conservative Party won 34.79% of the vote, giving it four seats, but she was fifth on the party list. Parliamentary career After being selected on 6 February 2010 to stand as Conservative candidate in the Suffolk Coastal constituency, Coffey moved from Hampshire to Westleton. The Rev. David Miller, vice-chairman of the local Liberal Democrats, raised questions over the status of her residency there, claiming with reference to her Westleton property that \\"The address at which Ms Coffey currently resides is a holiday let\\". She owns a flat and partly owns a house, both in Hampshire, and has the tenancy of a house in Westleton. At the general election on 6 May 2010 she won the Suffolk Coastal seat, becoming the constituency's first female Member of Parliament. Coffey received 25,475 votes (46.4% of the vote), an increase of 1.8% on John Gummer's 2005 campaign. She is a supporter of the Free Enterprise Group. On 6 July 2011, she defended Rebekah Brooks over the News of the Worlds involvement in the news media phone hacking scandal. She said a \\"witch hunt\\" was developing against Brooks, and that simply to say Brooks was editor of the newspaper at the time was not enough evidence against her. Coffey became a member of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee inquiry into the hacking scandal in 2012. In that committee, she declined to support any motions critical of Rupert and James Murdoch.The Guardian 2 May 2012 However, she later joined the majority of her party in voting for exemplary damages to be a default consequence to deter press misbehaviour.The Public Whip Retrieved 26 March 2013 Frontbench career Coffey was a member of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee from July 2010 to October 2012, when she was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to Michael Fallon, Minister for Business and Energy. In July 2014, she was appointed an Assistant Government Whip. In 2013 she voted against the legalisation of same- sex marriage, stating: \\"I shall be voting against the Bill because my perspective on what marriage is really about is different from that of some other Members... for me it is fundamentally still about family, the bedrock of society.\\"Hansard, Commons Debates, col 220, 5 February 2013. She again voted against same-sex marriage in 2019 when Parliament considered the same question for Northern Ireland. She was appointed Deputy Leader of the House of Commons on 11 May 2015. In the House of Commons she sits on the Environmental Audit Committee and has previously sat on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee. Coffey's decision to author a paper for the Free Enterprise Group recommending pensioners should be forced to pay National Insurance provoked a backlash among older constituents, who claimed that in an already tough economic environment, it was wrong to tax pensioners further. However, she said that she had \\"no regrets writing about National Insurance\\" and that it was \\"a policy proposal ‚Äì it is by no means, at this stage, anymore than that.\\" Coffey also faced criticism from Suffolk residents over her support for the Government's proposal to sell off forestry and woodland in public ownership, in 2011. Protestors argued that \\"previous experience shows us that when private landowners come in they close car parks and make access as difficult as possible.\\" Coffey voted for the bill, but the proposal was afterward dropped by the government. In October 2016, she was criticised by the then Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron for accepting hospitality worth ¬£890 from Ladbrokes after supporting the gambling industry in parliament as part of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee. Coffey denied that she had been \\"influenced in her considerations on matters of related policy by any hospitality received\\". In January 2016, an amendment intended to force rented homes to be maintained as \\"fit for human habitation\\" was defeated in parliament. Coffey was one of the 72 MPs voting against it who were themselves landlords who derived an income from a property. In July 2016, Coffey joined the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as Parliamentary Under- Secretary of State for Environment and Rural Opportunities, under Theresa May. When Boris Johnson became Prime Minister in July 2019, Coffey was promoted to Minister of State.  Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  Following the resignation of Amber Rudd in September 2019, Coffey joined the cabinet as the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. Upon her appointment, she was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council, giving her the honorific title \\"The Right Honourable\\" for life. Initially a stop-gap appointment, she retained her position in Boris Johnson's February 2020 post-Brexit cabinet reshuffle. In June 2020, Coffey responded to footballer Marcus Rashford's campaign for free school meals for children during the COVID-19 pandemic by replying \\"Water cannot be disconnected though\\" to a tweet from Rashford urging the government to remember Britain's poorest families, and which included the sentence: \\"When you wake up this morning and run your shower, take a second to think about parents who have had their water turned off during lockdown.\\" Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said \\"Imagine having priorities so warped that a snarky comment is your response to Marcus Rashford's powerful campaign. Therese Coffey do the right thing: apologise and vote for free school meals for children in poverty this summer.\\" Coffey subsequently deleted her earlier comments and stated her help and support for Rashford. Personal life An avid football fan, she supports Liverpool F.C., and signed the Early Day Motion set down by Labour Liverpool Walton MP Steve Rotheram requesting a knighthood for Kenny Dalglish. She is a keen fan of the rock band Muse. Her sister Clare has worked in her parliamentary office as a secretary since 2015.

Daguerreotype from 1845 Mads Alstrup (1808-1876) was the first Danish portrait photographer with his own studio. For 16 years, he produced an enormous number of daguerreotypes, in Copenhagen and the provinces, before his business suffered from the financial crisis of 1857. He moved to Sweden in 1858 and continued to take portraits there for the remainder of his life. He is considered to be one of Denmark's pioneers in the practice of photography. Daguerreotype portraits in Denmark Born in Viborg and trained as a goldsmith, Alstrup initially had a business in Randers in Jutland. In the summer of 1842, he moved to Copenhagen and set up a daguerreotype studio behind the Hercules Pavilion in the Rosenborg Gardens. In this popular area of the city, he had no difficulty in finding clients interested in having their portraits taken.Dansk Fotografihistorie, ed. Mette Sandbye. Gyldendal, Copenhagen. 2004, p. 29. From 1843 to 1848, he travelled around Denmark, spending a few days or weeks in different towns where he set up temporary studios. In 1849, he finally settled in Copenhagen, opening a studio at a central location on √òstergade near Kongens Nytorv. While Alstrup was by no means an artist, he was a competent tradesman and, unlike some of the more artistic photographers of his day, he could run a profitable business. Constantly investing in new equipment, the quality of his work improved year by year. Indeed, it is estimated he produced some 33,000 daguerreotypes in the 16 years he worked in Denmark.Marie-Louise Berner, \\"Mads Alstrups virsomhed som daguerreotypist 1842‚Äì1858 \\".

Although Houghton had little compositional training, his music has achieved critical acclaim. In particular, his piece St√©l√© was recorded by John Williams in his 1998 album The Guitarist.

Houghton composed music for film and Television, including the motion picture \\"The Custodian\\" (John Dingwall) and the animation series Plasmo (Tony Lawrence). He wrote a large number of unpublished sketches for electronic media and produced a record of his own experimental improvisations on electric guitar and piano frame, distributed privately.

The college is one of the oldest colleges in the present- day Tamilnadu state and one of the first to be started in the erstwhile princely state of Travancore. The alumni of the college are called Scottians. History The college had its origins in a village-church school founded in 1809 at Mylaudy by the Revd William Tobias Ringeltaube, the pioneering missionary of the London Missionary Society in South Travancore. This Central School or Seminary was shifted to Nagercoil in 1818 by the Revd Charles Mead. The Revd Dr James Duthie took charge of the Seminary in 1860, and played a vital role in raising it to a College. In 1893 the Seminary was elevated to a Second Grade College affiliated to the University of Madras with twelve students under the Revd Dr James Duthie as the first Principal. He was succeeded by Mr. J.E. Dennison who was the Principal of the College from 1894 to 1898. After Mr Dennison severed his connection with the South Travancore Mission in 1898 the Revd Duthie nourished the young institution till the arrival of the Revd George Parker who assumed charge in January 1901. The College recorded rapid progress under the Revd Parker's care. The Indian Universities' Act of 1904 introduced the Intermediate Examination course in the place of First in Arts (F.A) Examination course. The Revd Parker built the Science Block for the College in 1908-1910 with a legacy of ¬£1000 from the family of Mr. Septimus Scott and a grant from the government of Travancore. With money donated by the Revd Parker's father-in-law, Mr. E. D. Pochin of Manchester an extensive plot of ground was purchased for the recreation of students. During the Revd Parker's furlough, the Revd Dr Sydney Cave was in charge of the College from 1909 to 1911. The Revd Parker returned in February 1911 and resumed charge. The Revd R. H. Eastaff who was appointed to assist the Revd Parker arrived on 3 February 1921 and took over as Principal in June, 1921 when the Revd Parker left on furlough. To the Revd Eastaff goes the honour of having started The Scott Christian College and School Magazine which was published every term during his period of service in the College. On the return of the Revd Parker in November 1923 the Revd Eastaff left the College and took charge of the Divinity School in Trivandrum. The Library was equipped with up-to-date volumes which ran up to 4000 in 1924. During the year 1924-25 in addition to the Literary Associations in English, Tamil and Malayalam, a Science Association was formed and students themselves presided over meetings. In 1925 H.E. Viscount Goshen, Governor of Madras visited the College. The Silver Jubilee of Mr. Parker's service was celebrated on 12 February 1926. On 1 February 1927, Mr. G.H. Marsden, M.A. Tripos of the University of Cambridge took charge as Principal. He took special care in increasing the facilities for the Science Department. By selfless and untiring work he built up the small Intermediate College of about 140 students. Women students in regular batches were admitted from 1927 onwards and he introduced an annual medical inspection of students in 1928. Compulsory games were introduced for the men students in 1927. Scott Christian became the first Mofussil College in the Madras University to have Compulsory Physical Education for men students under a qualified Physical Director with the status of a Lecturer. There was provision for Badminton and Tennikoit for the women students. Lord Irwin the Viceroy with Lady Irwin paid a visit to the College on 9 December 1929. In 1934 Intramural games were organised and so enthusiastically did the students participate in these events that from among them blossomed forth outstanding sportspersons. In 1936, Mr. Marsden's great interest in Astronomy brought him the rare distinction of being chosen to observe the Solar Eclipse in Japan. When the University of Travancore was established in 1938 the Scott Christian College was admitted to its privileges. By 1943 the number of students in the College had increased to nearly 300 including about 20 women. Since 1948 a period of expansion commenced. The Travancore University sent a Commission which suggested the strength of the Intermediate Classes to be doubled as a prelude to the introduction of degree classes. Mr. A. Nesamony, who had played a distinguished role in Church and public life, took up the responsibility of building the new Degree College block. His persistence, patience and hard work yielded spectacular results. The year 1950 saw the introduction of Degree courses at Scott Christian. The first majors introduced were Mathematics and History, and this was followed by Chemistry (1952), Economics (1954), Physics (1954) and Zoology (1956). Mr. B. Arumai Raj succeeded Mr. Marsden in 1957. The Linguistic Reorganisation of States caused this area to be merged with Madras State and the College had to be affiliated to the University of Madras in 1957. A General Inspection Commission led by Dr. A. Lakshmanaswamy Mudaliar, Vice-Chancellor of Madras University visited the College and recommended moving the College to a more spacious campus. Soon 43 acres of land was purchased for the New Campus on the National Highway 47. B.Sc. Botany Major was introduced in June 1966. The college was affiliated to the Madurai University in the same year. Mr. Arumai Raj retired in 1966 and Dr. John D.K. Sundersingh took over as Principal. In 1967 the Scott Christian College celebrated its 75th Anniversary as the Platinum Jubilee. The Degree Classes were shifted to the New Campus during 1970 -1971. The College progressively introduced new courses for the undergraduates: B.A. English (1971), B.Com. (1978), B.A. Tamil (1979) and self-financed B.Sc. Computer Science (1997), B.Sc. Physical Education (2002), B.Com. (2002), BBA (2003), BBM (2007) and BCA (2007). The commencing of post-graduate courses in 1971 was a significant landmark in the history of this College and now there are eleven postgraduate courses in arts, science and commerce subjects. The courses offered at the postgraduate level include M.A. English Literature (1971), M.A. Economics (1971), M.Sc. Zoology (1980), M.Com. (1981), M.Sc. Chemistry (1982), M.Sc. Botany (1983), M.Sc. Physics (1987), M.Sc. Mathematics (1988) and self- financed M.A. History (1992), M.A. Tamil (1994), M.Sc. Computer Science (2003), PGDCA (2006), M.Sc. Micro-biology (2007) and PGDBM (2007). Pre- doctoral courses were introduced in 1984. The following M.Phil. courses are offered by the college. They include Zoology (1984), Botany (1986), Economics (1986), Commerce (1991), Tamil (1996), Physics (1996), English (2001), Chemistry (2006), History (2006) and Mathematics (2006). In 1990 the Madurai University recognized Scott Christian as a Research Centre for Economics and sanction was given for Ph.D. in Economics from June 1990. in addition to the following Centres that offer facilities for doctoral research - Zoology(1996), Tamil (1998), Botany (1999), Commerce (2000), English (2003), Chemistry (2004), History (2008) and Physics (2010). Intercom facilities were introduced in 1972 followed by Fax and Internet in 1999. A web page was added in 2001. The Status of Autonomy was conferred on Scott Christian College, in April 2005, perhaps the most historic moment in the annals of this pioneering seat of higher learning in the South. The NAAC Peer team visit in campus in April 2009 and College was awarded ‚ÄòA‚Äô the highest grade. The Ida Marsden Hostel was extended accommodation 500 students in 2009. The UGC has constituted an Expert Committee to evaluate the performance and academic attainments for the Extension of Autonomous Status. The process is expect to be completed within couple of months.

Renaming of \\"Shaolin Sect\\" to \\"Monks' Sect\\" In the series, the Shaolin Sect (or Shaolin Monastery) has been renamed to \\"Monks' Sect\\" (ÂÉß‰∫∫Ê¥æ). The change is believed to be because the producers wanted to avoid trademark infringement, since Shaolin Monastery has officially registered \\"Shaolin\\" as a trademark and has been involved in lawsuits with commercial companies over the use of \\"Shaolin\\" as a brand name or trademark.

The Glasgow Society of Lady Artists was founded in 1882 by eight female students of the Glasgow School of Art with the aim of affording due recognition to women in the field of art. It has been described by Jude Burkhauser as \\"the first residential club in Scotland run by and for women\\". In the early days of the club, they met at 136 Wellington Street, Glasgow. Glasgow Society of Lady Artists‚Äô Club, external wall carving The names of the founding members are somewhat under discussion, but they are thought to include: first president Georgina Mossman Greenlees, Mrs Joseph Agnew, Elizabeth Patrick, Margaret M Campbell, Henrietta Robertson, treasurer Frieda Rohl, Jane Nisbet, Helen Salmon, Jane Cowan Wyper, Margaret Macdonald (not Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh), Isabella Ure and Mrs Provan. They were all students of staff at Glasgow School of Art, and were successful artists, teachers and art workers. Their first meeting, in 1882, was held in the studio of Robert Greenlees, Georgina Greenlees' father, who helped the group write a book of rules. The object of the society was \\"The study of Art, to be promoted by means of life classes and monthly meetings at which members will be required to exhibit sketches, and by an annual exhibition of members' work\\". By 1895, the group had accumulated sufficient funds to allow the purchase of a house at No. 5 Blythswood Square. By 1897 the partnership of George Henry Walton and Fred Rowntree had designed and constructed a gallery for the Club's fourteenth Annual Exhibition. In 1898, a fire in the club buildings destroyed the early records of the club. Another disastrous fire on 27 May 1901 destroyed the Gallery and pictures for a special Summer Exhibition mounted in conjunction with the International Exhibition at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. The Gallery was rebuilt to the design of George Henry Walton and the first exhibition was held on 25 October 1902. In 1907 a Decoration Committee commissioned Charles Rennie Mackintosh to carry out certain interior work and the striking black pedimented neo-classical front door. The Club thrived over the following 64 years until 1971 when it was sold to the Scottish Arts Council. Some members were determined to revive the Society, which duly happened in 1975 when it was renamed The Glasgow Society of Women Artists with a Centenary Exhibition being held in the Collins Gallery in 1982.

Early life and career Gianni was born in Viareggio, Tuscany, Italy. He served as a soldier during the Italo-Turkish War and World War I, becoming a diver after seeing divers on warships. In 1911 he plugged a leak on the Italian battleship Regina Elena after it had collided with the Saint-Bon in stormy seas. In 1916 he suffered from decompression sickness after participating in a submarine recovery in La Spezia. Diving equipment Gianni is best known for building a decompression chamber, which he called the cassa disazotatrice, in 1916. Another of his major achievements was the \\"torretta butoscopica\\", (direct translation: exploration turret), a one-man atmospheric pressure underwater observation chamber deployed by a lifting cable from a ship, provided with a telephone, and supplied with breathing air from the surface, which he designed, built and tested. Recovery operations Gianni gained international fame for his work as a diver. He worked on the case of the Spanish steamship Cruz, sunk on Scoglio del Catalano (Catalan Cliff) on the west coast of Sardinia. Because the shipwreck seemed suspicious, British insurers sought divers able to check it, but none accepted the job due to its technical difficulty. Gianni accepted on condition that he would receive twice the compensation offered because of the difficulty of the job. The request was accepted and Gianni accomplished his task, finding the intentional nature of the shipwreck. He then appeared in court in London to confirm the findings, earning recognition for himself and the superiority of Italian divers. Another famous case was the recovery in Lake Como of the Lariana company's boat Lecco, sunk on the evening of 18 February 1927 in the port of Como. Gianni's most widely known achievement was probably the discovery of the wreck of the SS Egypt, sunk in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Brest in Brittany, France, at a depth of about 120m and carrying a precious cargo of gold bullion and silver. Attempts to locate the ship and recover the treasure had been made by the most famous companies of the time. In the end Lloyd's of London commissioned the credible and organized SO.RI.MA. (\\"Society for Maritime Recovery\\") founded by Commendatore Giovanni Quaglia, who finally succeeded with the recovery ship Artiglio (\\"Talon\\"), on which Gianni worked as chief diver and underwater operations manager. His exploits were described by journalist David Scott, who followed all the events of recoveries on behalf of the SO.RI.MA. company for The Times of London, living aboard its ships and writing numerous articles and two books. Death Aristide Franceschi, Alberto Gianni, Alberto Bargellini After locating the SS Egypt, due to bad weather and the inability to carry out its recovery, while waiting for suitable weather conditions, the SO.RI.MA. company got the job to carry out some recovery operations near the island of Belle √éle, south of Brest, sending the ship Artiglio with Gianni as head of operations. Gianni died on 7 December 1930 during the dismantling of the SS Florence H., sunk full of explosives and ammunition. The Artiglio was swept away, destroyed and sunk by the explosion. Two other famous divers, Alberto Bargellini and Aristide Franceschi, and nine other crew members perished with Gianni. The tragedy occurred at a time of great euphoria given the real possibility of recovering the valuable sunken treasure of the Egypt. The gold of the Egypt The \\"torretta butoscopica\\" The recovery of the Egypt's treasure was then carried out by the SO.RI.MA. company outfitting a new ship, called the Nuovo Artiglio, for the occasion. The operation achieved a resounding success at the international level since it was the first step in the world of deep- water recovery, something considered impossible at the time, carried out by Italian divers and which became possible thanks to the organization left by Gianni and the use of his inventions, especially the \\"torretta butoscopica\\". Congratulations were sent from all over the world, including from George V (King of the United Kingdom), Benito Mussolini, and then-communications minister Costanzo Ciano.

The idea was formed by the Swedish entrepreneur Dan Olofsson and his wife Christin. Their goal was to help young African people actualize their dreams and to support them to live an AIDS-free life by refraining from having unsafe sex. Over 60,000 youths are educated in the prevention of HIV/AIDS by Star for Life in South Africa and Namibia. These youths are students at the 62 schools run by Star for Life there. The first school was started in the autumn of 2005 in the South African province KwaZulu-Natal. Olofsson paid for the expenses (15 million kronor) of this school by himself; the rest of the schools were paid for by sponsors. A fund was created for the programme and, as of 2008, 55 million kronor had been raised from donations by various Swedish company leaders such as Stefan Persson (H&M;) and AB Volvo. Alf Svensson, one of the people behind Star for Life, has commented on the advice given to youths by the programme: \\"It's either safe sex or no sex at all. The results have been fantastic. We have lowered the amount of teen pregnancies significantly.\\" The school programme lasts three years and uses colours, art, music, and sports as important parts of the education. They also work with strengthening the school children's self-esteem through coaching and support. Many South African youths have been given the opportunity to travel to Sweden to perform at concerts to raise money for the programme. These concerts help the youths to strengthen their esteem. The Swedish band Triple & Touch has done several concerts with African youths to support Star for Life. In addition to music, several football teams have been created in Africa. Star for Life has received support from Mandla Mandela, Nelson Mandela's grandson, who helped raise money for the project when he came to Sweden in late 2009. The Star for Life logo appeared on the front of the professional football club Malm√∂ FF's shirts during the 2009 Allsvenskan season. Olofsson received a Global Business Coalition award in 2008 for Star for Life. Among the 700 guests at the award ceremony were Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon, who praised the programme.

Written by Kie≈õlowski and Hanna Krall, the film is about the workers protests in June '76 in Radom, as seen from the perspective of the local Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party. The film is based on real events, but the characters are fictional. Short Working Day was filmed in 1981, but had its official premiere on television only in 1996. During these 15 years, however, it was shown many times in film clubs and at special movie show-times. Plot In 1968, a young man addresses a meeting of protesters by condemning the firebrands who are agitating the students. Eight years later, in Radom, Poland during the June 1976 protests, the young man is now the local First Secretary of the Communist Party (Wenceslaus Ulewicz). He is facing a mob of strikers protesting a 69 percent increase in food prices by the central government. Demonstrations in the industrial towns of Radom and Plock quickly lead to the beating and firing of thousands of workers. The party secretary tries to appease the crowds of workers massing beneath his window. Despite the growing threat, he decides to stick it out at the party's office instead of making the recommended hasty escape. While the protesters become increasingly hostile in their calls for a repeal of the price increases, the party secretary remains strong outwardly in his speeches. With bullhorn in hand, he believes he can talk and reason with the protesters. When he is alone, however, he seems lost in his private thoughts and fears. As the morning passes, the secretary becomes increasingly vulnerable because the central government refuses to yield to the protesters' demands. By the afternoon, the party secretary finally yields to the police chief's orders that he leave his office. As the secretary exits the building, the protesters set fire to his office furniture. Five years later, the same secretary is on television explaining his actions during the June 1976 protests.

They recorded their debut album with producer Mark Dodson, though M√∂tley Cr√ºe's Tommy Lee co-produced two songs. The album featured contributions from Stephen Perkins of Jane's Addiction, John Norwood Fisher of Fishbone and Bronx Style Bob among others. The same year, Kushner contributed guitars to the song \\"Punk It Up\\" for the Infectious Grooves debut album The Plague That Makes Your Booty Move...It's the Infectious Grooves, also produced by Dodson, released in 1991 before touring with the band for a short time.

Munich (, ) is a Spanish company and brand specialized in sport and fashion shoes. The company headquarters are located in Capellades, province of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Munich produces more than 850.000 pairs of shoes per year, 46% of sports type, and 54% of fashion type. The company has reached a privileged position in the field of fashion,Fashion from Spain, Interview with Xavier Berneda, marketing director of Munich growing in many European and Asian countries, mainly Japan. The X symbol is what makes its shoes special and identifiable.  History  Munich shoe with the characteristic \\"X\\" symbol. The company was founded by Lu√≠s Berneda in year 1939 at the city of Sant Boi de Llobregat, with the initial company name Berneda, manufacturer of shoes for rugby football, futsal, handball and boxing, among other sports. In 1953 the brothers Javier and Francisco, second generation of the family, entered the track and field athletics market, and were the pioneers in sports shoe making in Spain. In 1964 they added the characteristic \\"X\\" symbol and changed the company and brand name from \\"Berneda\\" to \\"Munich\\". The production remained Spanish, with design and technology influences from Italy and Germany. The brand became popular and its shoes were used by soccer players such as Ladislao Kubala and Hugo Sotil. Marko Krivokapic from Club Balonmano Valladolid, sponsored by Munich In year 1999 Xavier Berneda, marketing manager of the company, and his brother David, financial manager, both of them grandsons of the company founder, convinced the father and uncle to diversify the company and enter the field of street shoes and fashion. The Asian production, specially from China, was already a fierce competitor.El Periodico, Munich, en Capellades Thanks to this initiative, Xavier Berneda won in year 2008 the Spanish award \\"Young Entrepreneur\\". Xavier has changed the company, entering the streetwear fashion market, keeping the company design and quality standards but opening it to new markets. Around half of the production is sold to fashion victims ready to spend from 120 to 300 euros in a pair of sports shoes. The Munich shoes are used by well known people such as John Elkann, vice-president of Fiat, √Ängel Ll√†cer, Jes√∫s V√°zquez, Rafael Amargo, Boris Izaguirre and Manuel Fuentes. One of the most innovative activities of the company is the website Munich My Way, launched in 2009. On that site everybody is welcomed to personalize and design a pair of shoes combining many possible colors and textures, resulting in up to 333 million different combinations. The user can select the color of any of the main 9 parts of a shoe, including the sole, flap, heel and cords. When Munich receives the order, the factory produces those shoes, and delivers it within 2 weeks. Munich My Way also offers the possibility of buying a different size of the right shoe compared to the left one. This is specially useful for soccer and futsal players who often require a bigger size for the shoe used to shoot.Anoia Diari, Munich My Way, 333 milions de Munich possibles via internet  Awards  * E-COMM Award 2010, category ‚ÄúSportive equipment‚Äù.noticierotextil.net, La firma Munich, premiada  References   External links  *Munich site *Munich My Way Category:Sporting goods manufacturers of Spain Category:Clothing companies of Spain Category:Shoe brands Category:Spanish brands Category:Sportswear brands Category:Athletic shoe brands Category:Clothing companies established in 1939 Category:Companies based in Catalonia Category:Anoia Category:Shoe companies of Spain Category:1939 establishments in Spain ","title":"Munich (sport shoes)"},{"id":"26120254","text":"Chodavaram is a village in Kondapi mandal, Prakasam District, Andhra Pradesh, India.

There are three Class ratings that can be included in the licence. Microlight, Simple Single Engine Aircraft (SSEA) and Self Launched Motor Glider (SLMG). Each Class has its own training syllabus. Further details of each Class and training requirements are published on the NPPL website. Legal authority The National Private Pilot Licence is issued by the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority. Holders are entitled to fly UK registered single-engined aircraft or microlights and self-powered gliders within UK airspace. Aircraft pilots may carry up to 3 passengers and fly using VFR Visual Flight Rules during daylight hours. It has more restrictions than a full Private Pilot Licence (PPL), but requires fewer hours of practical training and less stringent medical checks. The NPPL may be taken as a goal in its own right, or used as a step towards the full PPL which permits flying in other countries and other qualifications. Thirty hours of practical flying instruction counts towards the 45 hours minimum requirements of the PPL. There are separate syllabuses for aeroplanes and self-launching motor gliders.http://www.nationalprivatepilotslicence.co.uk/New/Syllabus.htm The principal reference for flight crew licensing in the UK is LASORS,http://www.caa.co.uk/application.aspx?categoryid=33&pagetype;=65&applicationid;=11&mode;=detail&id;=1591(1) which is published annually by the CAA on paper and online. After 17 September 2012, this will be replaced by CAP 804.http://www.caa.co.uk/application.aspx?catid=33&pagetype;=65&appid;=11&mode;=detail&id;=5000 Territory Holders of the NPPL are qualified to fly within UK airspace including the Isle of Man,http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/dti/aircraftRegistry/Exemptions_Permissions/ex032010npplandppl1.pdf Channel Islands and now France.http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/175/090928_UK%20NPPL_Explanatory%20Note_Initial%20Issue.pdf Flights must be conducted according to Visual Flight Rules (i.e. in sight of the ground and away from cloud). This includes both controlled and uncontrolled airspace. Special VFR flights may be permitted on request of air traffic control, enabling transit through a control zone which would otherwise be out of bounds. Aircraft Only UK registered aircraft of up to four seats and with a maximum indicated airspeed (IAS) of 140 knots may be flown. NPPL holders can be licensed to fly different types of aircraft. They will require a few hours of additional differences training on each new type of aircraft and an additional type rating licence to be issued. Passengers An NPPL pilot with the appropriate medical declaration may take up to three passengers (i.e. a total of four on board). This must not be for remuneration, although costs of the flight may be shared. Before taking passengers, pilots must have conducted three take-offs and full-stop landings in the same aircraft type within the preceding 90 days. Medical requirements The NPPL has much less stringent medical requirements than a full PPL. The pilot's General Practitioner, who has access to the medical records of the applicant, can sign the medical declaration.http://www.caa.co.uk/default.aspx?catid=49&pagetype;=90&pageid;=873 The GP is allowed to charge for this service, but in practice many do not. There are two levels which match those required for professional drivers ‚Äì DVLA Class 1 permits solo flight and flight with another pilot, while DVLA Class 2 permits flights with up to three passengers. The medical declaration form must be signed off prior to the first solo flight and lasts for five years up to the age of 64 and beyond 65 years of age lasts for one year. Training Flight training is available from most flight schools around the UK. Instruction is given by qualified PPL flight instructors ‚Äì there is no separate or reduced grading for NPPL instructors themselves. A minimum of 25 hours flying time is required (for microlight aircraft, 32 for light aircraft), of which at least 10 hours must be solo. The solo flight time must include 4 hours of cross country which may include the solo qualifying cross country flight of at least 100 nm with two landings away. A further 2 to 3 hours flying time should be allowed for the two practical tests that follow. Seven theory exams must be passed ‚Äì these are the same syllabus and level as for the PPL although the authorities are considering introducing a simplified syllabus. A practical VHF radio operator examination with a qualified examiner must be attained. This is not required for flights (including solo flights) while still under training. Competency in the use of the English Language must be certified. Two practical tests must be passed: * A Navigation Skills Test,http://www.nationalprivatepilotslicence.co.uk/New/SLMG%20-%20NST%20notes.pdf which involves flying a distance of 100 nm. This is shorter than the 150 nm required for the PPL, and many choose to undertake the longer test to avoid retaking it when upgrading to PPL later. * A General Skills Test, where the pilot is required to demonstrate competence across the whole range of abilities for safe flying. Licensing Once the requirements and tests have been passed, the NPPL Licence itself is issued within a few weeks through the National Pilot Licensing Group Limited,http://www.nppl.uk.com/ authorised by the CAA who publish a guide on the requirements and how to obtain one. The licence must be re-validated every 2 years. In order to remain current, NPPL pilots are required to: * have flown for 12 hours within the previous 24 months * have flown for 6 hours within the previous 12 months * have had 1 hour of dual-instruction from a qualified instructor * have a valid medical declaration Alternatively, another General Skills Test may be taken. Limitations NPPL holders may not: * fly non-UK registered aircraft * fly outside UK territorial waters except for Channel Islands, Isle of Man or France. * qualify directly for night flying or Instrument Flying Rules Future changes The European flight crew regulations are expected to change in 2012 and be centrally administered by the European Aviation Safety Authority. Proposals have been made to introduce an EU-wide light aircraft pilot licence (LAPL) in the future, replacing national licences such as the UK NPPL.http://www.easa.europa.eu/ws_prod/r/doc/NPA/NPA%202008-17a.pdf Existing NPPL pilots are likely to be able to transfer to this new scheme without further (re)tests. This may allow today's NPPL pilots to fly in other EU countries. The CAA's interpretation of the expected effects of this new European legislation were updated in June 2011.http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/620/e-June2011v41.pdf References External links * Category:Aviation licenses and certifications Category:Aviation in the United Kingdom ","title":"National Private Pilot Licence"},{"id":"26120313","text":"Valeri Ivanovich Shikunov (; born 28 October 1968) is a former Russian professional football player.

It is considered a facet of human capital. Cross-cultural capital is conceived as a broad construct and it is composed of both dispositional (or, more trait-like) and experience-based elements (more statelike), including personality dispositions (e.g., openness to experience), values and beliefs (e.g.,pro-diversity beliefs), cognitive style (cognitive flexibility) and acquired specific skills (e.g., mastery of several languages) as well as of relevant experiences (e.g., traveling, living and working in different countries; growing up in a multicultural environment). Some scholars include cultural intelligence (CQ) as one of the state-like components of cross-cultural capital. This corresponds to Ang and Van Dyne's (2008) nomological network of cultural intelligence model, where cultural intelligence is conceptualized as a more of state-like construct that mediates distal factors, which are typified as trait-like (e.g., personality traits) and intermediate constructs such as communication apprehension and anxiety, which, in turn, are postulated to affect a host of individual and interpersonal outcomes that can be broadly classified into performance and cultural adaptation.

It concentrates on mostly single releases from the mid to late 60's, which fluctuates between adult contemporary pop and jazzy swing. The album opens up with Sinatra's recent number one hit \\"Strangers in the Night\\" and continues through the varied styles of music Sinatra recorded in the 60's, from easy listening ballads like \\"It Was a Very Good Year\\" and \\"Softly, as I Leave You\\" to contemporary pop like \\"When Somebody Loves You\\" and \\"That's Life\\". Greatest Hits was a modest hit, peaking at #55 on the album charts in late 1968. A second volume was issued in 1972, Frank Sinatra's Greatest Hits, Vol. 2.

It was first published by McPhee Gribble in 1980. Garner's second published book, it was written while she lived in Paris, France. Australian literary critic Peter Craven described Garner's second published work as \\"less vigorous perhaps than Monkey Grip, but showing greater artistry.\\" \\"Honour\\" Honour is about the relationship between two people, separated but still legally married and with a child of the marriage, their ongoing friendship, and the changes to relationship when the former husband re-partners. \\"Other People's Children\\" Other People's Children is about the disruption and end of relationship between two women, Scotty and Ruth, who live in a collective household. Scotty loves Ruth's daughter \\"as only the childless can love other people's children\\". Into Scotty's life comes Madigan, \\"a great lump of a fellow with yellow eyes, who bunched his thick fingers together in front of him when he entered a room\\". Reception Honour & Other People's Children was well received both in Australia and internationally. The book was released in the United States in April 1982 and received an enthusiastic review in The New York Times, where Carolyn See wrote: \\"Helen Garner's Australia is a land both bucolic and exotic, a land of junkies and wallabies, of women's rights and outdoor plumbing, of homeless children in a beneficent atmosphere, of people looking up at night to see a thousand stars, a land where they jump on their bikes and ride through the warm, grass-scented evening air down to public parks without the slightest thought of being mugged. In other words - though it may be a shamelessly provincial way of perceiving it - the Australian world we see here is America in a time warp.\\" References Category:1980 short story collections Category:Single-writer short story collections ","title":"Honour &amp; Other People's Children"},{"id":"26120444","text":"Sir Clifford Charles Butler FRS (20 May 1922 ‚Äì 30 June 1999) was an English physicist, best known for the discovery of the hyperon and meson types of particles. In later life, Butler was involved in educational policy, serving as director of the Nuffield Foundation and vice-chancellor of Loughborough University. Life Butler was born in Reading on 20 May 1922, the son of Charles Hannington James Butler, a clerk and buyer to a local wholesale grocer, and his wife Olive Pembroke. He attended both Reading School and the University of Reading, becoming both a Bachelor of Science and a Doctor of Philosophy there. He was appointed assistant lecturer in physics at the University of Manchester in 1945, and lecturer in 1947. In the same year he married Kathleen Betty Collins. They had two daughters. He died in Glenfield Hospital, near Leicester on 30 June 1999. Work At Manchester, Butler worked with G. D. Rochester, studying cosmic rays using a cloud chamber. During this research, they found two unexpected events, one in October 1946 and one in May 1947, showing previously unknown particles. These V particles were a thousand times heavier than the electron and long-lived on nuclear timescales. In order to increase the rate of detection with a higher flux of cosmic rays, the equipment was moved to the Pic du Midi de Bigorre observatory in the Pyrenees. The existence of the particles was confirmed by a group from the California Institute of Technology led by Carl Anderson, and the Butler group continued to study them and found that there were two types, hyperons and mesons. Butler's and Rochester's discovery may be seen as the first step towards understanding of the quark structure of matter. In 1953, Butler left Manchester to lead a high-energy nuclear physics group at Imperial College in London. He was promoted to professor in 1957, and head of the physics department in 1963. While at Imperial College London, Butler chaired the consortium established to design the British National Hydrogen Bubble Chamber, which was operated at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and CERN. From 1964, he chaired the CERN Track Chamber Committee. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1961, and served as dean of the Royal College of Science between 1966 and 1969. Over this period he became increasingly interested in educational policy, joining the academic planning board of the University of Kent in 1963, the Schools Council in 1965, and the University Grants Committee in 1966. He eventually served on the Schools Council for 19 years. In 1970, Butler resigned from Imperial College and his active involvement in physical research ceased. He accepted the role of director of the Nuffield Foundation, a charitable foundation influential in education. During his time there he set up a group for research and innovation in higher education, a programme for law and society, and the centre for agricultural strategy at the University of Reading. His role in the establishment of the Open University was also important, since the Nuffield Foundation funded a course on genetics as a test bed for other courses. He was appointed to the council of the Open University in 1971 and stayed as a member until 1995, serving as vice-chairman from 1986 to 1995. In 1975, Butler was appointed vice-chancellor of Loughborough University, retaining that post until he retired in 1985. Honours Butler was knighted in 1983 for his services to education.
