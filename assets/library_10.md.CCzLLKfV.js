It had two tracks and two side platforms. It was located in the New Brighton section of Staten Island, at the north end of Westervelt Avenue and Richmond Terrace (near Jersey Street). It was the closest original North Shore station to the Saint George Terminal, from the station. History The station opened on February 23, 1886 along with the rest of the North Shore branch west to Elm Park. The station was located near the edge of the Kill Van Kull, several feet below street level. The southernmost (St. George-bound) platform was constructed directly at the rear of apartment buildings. A wooden stationhouse, signed \\"NEW BRIGHTON R.R. STATION,\\" was located at street level at the foot of Westervelt Avenue between the buildings. The stationhouse led to an overpass and stairs down to the northern (west-bound) platform. Canopies were located at the eastern end of the station. West of the station, the line crossed Jersey Street at-grade. The New Brighton station is referred to as Westervelt Avenue on the map of the 1939 IND Second System plan, which would have connected the SIRT to subway lines in Brooklyn via the incomplete Staten Island Tunnel; New Brighton would have been the last stop on the North Shore Branch before entering the tunnel.Project for Expanded Rapid Transit Facilities, New York City Transit System, dated July 5, 1939 The station was closed and abandoned on March 31, 1953, along with the other passenger stations on the North Shore Branch. No trace of the station exist today. In the late 1990s, the Bank Street Bridge, which crossed over the line from Richmond Terrace near Jersey Street, was eliminated due to safety issues. Around that same time, Bank Street was extended east of Jersey Street adjacent to the former SIR right-of-way and parallel to Richmond Terrace, to provide access to the parking lot for the Richmond County Bank Ballpark. As of 2015, there are plans to reconstruct the bridge. New Brighton is one of the stations to be returned to operation under the proposals for reactivation of the North Shore branch for rapid transit, light rail, or bus rapid transit service. The potential station site has been moved farther west between Frankling and Lafayette Avenues, currently used by a farmer's market and the Atlantic Salt corporation; the latter owns the North Shore right-of-way east to Bank Street.

He appeared in over 300 films between 1927 and 1963. http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/person/p0283520.htm accessed 29 May 2009 Career Born to a sake brewing family in Kyoto, he first appeared on stage at age five in a theater run by his family as a side business. In 1918, he became a student of Nakamura Ganjir≈ç I and performed kabuki in the Kansai region. He joined the Shochiku studio in 1927 and made his film debut in Chigo no kenp≈ç under the name Ch≈çjir≈ç Hayashi. His good looks and graceful fighting style made him a major jidaigeki star, and he appeared in over 120 films for Shochiku in 11 years, with the best works being directed by Teinosuke Kinugasa. The 1935 Yukinoj≈ç henge was a significant hit. He moved to the Toho studio in 1937. On 11 November 1937, however, he was attacked by ruffians and his face slashed with razor blades. According to the historian Daisuke Miyao, \\"Even though there was no clear evidence, it was widely assumed that this violent incident was Shochiku's retaliatory measure against Hayashi's so- called betrayal.\\" He recovered and changed his stage name to his real name, Kazuo Hasegawa. Hasegawa appeared in many successful films for Toho, including several \\"national-policy pictures with Chinese settings\\", such as Song of the White Orchid (1939) and China Night (1940), with co-star Ri Koran. He moved to Daiei Film in 1950 and continued appearing in the popular Zenigata Heiji series. He also appeared in many classic films including Kozaburo Yoshimura's The Tale of Genji (1951), Kinugasa's Gate of Hell (1953), and Kenji Mizoguchi's The Crucified Lovers (1954). He was appointed to Daiei's board of directors in 1957. To celebrate his 300th film, Hasegawa appeared in a new version of Yukinoj≈ç henge (known abroad as An Actor's Revenge) in 1963 directed by Kon Ichikawa. He left Daiei that year and continued to appear on stage and television, including starring in the second NHK Taiga drama Ak≈ç R≈çshi in 1964. He also directed the Takarazuka Revue version of The Rose of Versailles in 1974.

Exit stairs and the overpass to Richmond Terrace were located at the east end of the station. The station was closed on March 31, 1953 along with all other stations on the North Shore Branch. =Current status= While the platforms of the station have been removed, the two stairways leading down to the former station and dock, and the retaining wall between the stairways, inscribed as \\"Sailors Snug Harbor\\" still stand today.

It had two side platforms and two tracks. It was located at-grade in the West New Brighton section of Staten Island, north of Richmond Terrace between North Burgher Avenue and Broadway. The station site is from the Saint George terminus. No trace of the station exists today. History The station opened on February 23, 1886. Constructed of wood, it had two high-level side platforms designed with Victorian features. A stationhouse and overpass were located in the center of the station, with the stationhouse sitting on the southern (eastbound) platform. West of the station, the line crossed an eight-foot high suspension bridge over Bodine Creek towards Port Richmond. The low clearance of the bridge attracted some individuals to fish and crab from the trestle, leading to several accidents. The low bridge was replaced with a concrete trestle between 1935 and 1937, ending just west of West Brighton station. The station closed on March 31, 1953, along with the rest of the North Shore branch as well as the South Beach branch. West New Brighton is one of the stations to be returned to operation under the proposals for reactivation of the North Shore branch for rapid transit, light rail, or bus rapid transit service. Though New York City owns the right-of-way of the line at the former station site, its location on developed property has made it difficult to restore service on the North Shore Branch line. The Arlington bound tracks of the right-of-way have been removed entirely and the Saint George bound tracks were left in place after freight operations ceased in the late 80's and were filled in with wood planks by the property owner and paved over for truck use at the dockyard location, although they have started to become visible through wear and tear of the paved roadway along the site Kill Van Kull.

Les Poup√©es de Paris (The Dolls of Paris) was a musical puppet show created, produced and directed by Sid and Marty Krofft, that toured the United States throughout the 1960s. History Puppeteers Sid and Marty Krofft had had a successful career on stages in America and Europe throughout the 1950s. One morning, Sid awoke with the idea to create a show with his marionettes for adults only,Sid & Marty Krofft Interview, Part 1 of 5 on YouTube. Retrieved January 17, 2009. complete with music, comedy, horror, celebrities and topless puppets. Nat Hart, a ma√Ætre d' at the Flamingo Hotel, became a fan of the Krofft's work during repeated viewings of their shows at the hotel. Hart approached the Kroffts one day and announced that he was going to open a club, and he asked the Kroffts to put together a puppet show as an attraction for the new club. The resulting show, which came to be known as Les Poup√©es de Paris, was modeled after the Paris revues Lido and Folies Berg√®re. The Kroffts opened the show at their newly built theater the Gilded Rafters in the San Fernando Valley, California in October 1961,Ogden Standard Examiner, August 24, 1962 \\"Guys Make Dough with Their 'Dolls'\\" though the show was later relocated to P.J.'s, a 200-seat dinner theatre in Los Angeles.\\"The Marquee\\" by Barbara Blayden, The Times, June 18, 1965 In addition to original characters, many of the puppets were modeled after celebrities. The Kroffts had previously been the opening act for entertainers like Judy Garland and Sammy Davis Jr., so they were able to get many celebrities to record voices for their puppets. Some of these puppets included Pearl Bailey, Milton Berle, Cyd Charisse, Gene Kelly, Liberace, Jayne Mansfield, Tony Martin, Phil Silvers, Loretta Young, and Mae West, whose puppet appeared topless. Les Poup√©es de Paris Souvenir Program A handful of puppets were unofficially modeled after other celebrities (Pelvis Essley), and several weren't created specifically for the show ‚Äî their Frankenstein, Dracula and Madame Jenkins Foster puppets all made brief appearances in the 1957 television pilot Here's Irving. The show was a success, and became a key attraction at the Seattle World's Fair in 1962, the New York World's Fair in 1964-1965, and the San Antonio HemisFair '68 in 1968. The lavish production cost $200,000\\"Adults Only\\" Time magazine, to produce; the elaborate sets took three months to install and included a revolving theatre, elevators, an ice- skating rink and waterfall. The Reverend Billy Graham caught the premiered World's Fair performance of the show and immediately denounced it, complaining that the \\"women don't wear bras\\". He failed to mention that the \\"women\\" were puppets. This anti-endorsement, coupled with a write-up in Time magazine, resulted in the show taking in record crowds ‚Äî the Kroffts claimed that tickets were scalped, and the performances were so packed that they couldn't let in personal friends. \\"Be sure to mention it's dirty, that will give them the picture,\\" Marty explained. The show traveled around the country for the remainder of the decade and was seen by an estimated nine and a half million people. Television Although there was a common practice of filming live shows to be broadcast as American television specials, Les Poup√©es de Paris was a bit too risque to air on television. However, the Kroffts did appear on several popular television shows to promote their live show, including The Jack Paar Show (November 1961) and The Bell Telephone Hour (December 8, 1964). Les Poup√©es led to a brief stint on The Dean Martin Show. In 1964, producer of The Dean Martin Show caught Les Poup√©es de Paris at the New York World's Fair, and recruited the Kroffts to create a puppet segment on Martin's variety show that captured the essence of Les Poup√©es. This was their first break into television, but it was to be short-lived; the Kroffts were fired after eight episodesHal Erickson, \\"E!

Buildings =Justizpalast = The palatial (old) Palace of Justice was constructed in 1890‚Äì97 by the architect Friedrich von Thiersch in neo-baroque style at the west side of the Karlsplatz (Stachus). The building of the Gr√ºnderzeit is dominated by a central glass dome (67 meters). The building is 138 meters long and 80 meters deep. The center of the building, which was designed around two courtyards, is the central hall measuring 19 m x 29 m. The four fa√ßades of the freestanding building are of varying proportions, but they have similarities with the granite base as a substructure and the colossal arrangement of pilasters or columns on the central structure and the corners. The three upper floors are surrounded by window frames and gables, the second floor being emphasized the most. On the northern fa√ßade, the east and west wings are projected as a corner avant-corps and the central section. Six columns with Corinthian capitals here form the upper floor. The longitudinal fronts and corner protrusions of the southern fa√ßade are similar to those of the northern fa√ßade, but the middle avant-corps is less prominent and is divided by pilasters. On the ground floor there is an open porch, which once served as an underpass for carriages. On the first floor, the front porch serves as a balcony. The three central axes of the avant-corps are crowned by a gable with the Bavarian coat of arms. On the pediment stands the statue of Justitia, flanked by Innocence and Vice. The east facade is strongly marked by the central avant-corps with a convex front and obelisks at all four corner points. The Justizpalast houses the Bavarian Department of Justice and the District Court I of Munich. The People's Court sentenced the members of the White Rose in the Justizpalast in 1943. Room 253 is today a memorial place. In 1962 Vera Br√ºhne and in 2014 Uli Hoene√ü were convicted in the Justizpalast. =New Justizpalast = New Justizpalast Munich Since the huge building turned out to be too small Friedrich von Thiersch constructed already in 1905 at the west side of the building the so-called New Justizpalast. This time he created the courthouse in strong contrast to the Justizpalast in red brick stone in northern neo-gothic style with two towers. The New Justice Building was once decorated with facade murals, now gone. The end facades are marked by high stepped gables and central dock towers on each of the sides are flanked by similar gables. The New Justizpalast houses the Bavarian Constitutional Court and the Higher Regional Court.

It is based on the book Annie's Coming Out which was written by Rosemary Crossley, allegedly with the assistance of Anne McDonald. The book tells the story of McDonald's early life in a government institution for people with severe disabilities and her subsequent release, as well as her therapist's attempts to communicate with her through the pseudoscientific method of facilitated communication. Premise Annie O'Farrell (based on Anne McDonald) is a 13-year-old girl with athetoid cerebral palsy who is unable to communicate and has been living in a government institution from an early age. Jessica Hathaway (based on Rosemary Crossley) is a therapist who learns to communicate with Annie using an alphabet board and comes to believe that although physically disabled, Annie is not intellectually impaired. When Annie turns 18, Jessica begins a legal fight to get her released.

It was originally intended that Ann McDonald play herself but she had grown too big by the time she left hospital so 9 year old Tina Arhondis was cast instead. Shooting started in September 1983 and went for four weeks, mostly at the Convent of the Good Shepherd in Melbourne. Reception Annie's Coming Out won three 1984 Australian Film Institute Awards for Best Film, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Lead Actress (Angela Punch McGregor). It was nominated for four other AFI awards. The film won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the 1984 Montr√©al World Film Festival. The film was not a large commercial success but it screened in the US as A Test of Love. Home media Annie's Coming Out was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in October 2010.

In 1982, the Fortnox song \\"Storm Inside My Head\\" went to number 44 in US AOR airplay and the band‚Äôs video reached the top 20 on MTV. The band toured non-stop for a year in support of the record, headlining medium venues and performing in stadiums as the supporting act for top rock acts. However, their success was short-lived. In 1984, Fowler's band Bombay recorded an album with British producer Eddy Offord. The record was supported by the MTV video \\"Rumble Tonight\\". He moved to Athens, Georgia in 1991 after months of touring overseas with Bad Fun, a band. He began performing with a number of Athens-based artists, including Ralph Roddenberry, Redneck Greece, and The Lonely White Boys (a band he formed with Drivin' N' Cryin guitarist Buren Fowler, Dreams So Real drummer Drew Worsham, and Normaltown Flyers bassist Greg Veale). Fowler played guitar in side band projects with Bill Berry (R.E.M.), Dave Schools (Widespread Panic, Government Mule), Randall Bramblett (Traffic), and a number of other well-known musicians from the area. In 1997, he organized a band to perform a rock concert benefit for Tourette syndrome awareness. Bill Berry, who was at the time retiring from the mega-star band R.E.M., made the show his farewell retirement performance, allowing his drums to be auctioned off for charity at the end of the night. Welcome Companions, a CD recorded by the benefit concert band, was released by Polyglot Records under the band name Rick Fowler and Friends in mid-2000.

Located north of Richmond Terrace at Bard Avenue in the Livingston section of Staten Island, it had two tracks and two side platforms. The site is from the Saint George terminal. Closed in 1953, the station was demolished, with few remnants of the site today. History The remaining St. George-bound trackway and the restaurant (left) along the ROW. The station opened on February 23, 1886 along with the other North Shore stations from St. George west to Elm Park. It sits on land formerly occupied by the mansion of Livingston namesake Anson Livingston, also known as the \\"Bleak House,\\" which was purchased by the North Shore Railroad in 1886. The town name \\"Livingston\\" was coined by SIRT officials. The station was located on a wooden trestle on the shore of the Kill Van Kull on the edge of the island, built with two wooden high-level side platforms. The former mansion was used as the stationhouse, with an overpass between the platforms on the west end of the station. Industrial buildings were located adjacent to the station, including a power plant of the Richmond Light and Railroad Company, which operated a streetcar line along Richmond Terrace parallel to the SIRT until 1934. The station was abandoned on March 31, 1953, along with the South Beach Branch and the rest of the North Shore Branch. Currently, the station site is occupied by an employee parking lot for the Con Edison facility located across the street. Just east of the site is a restaurant, R.H. Tugs, which sits adjacent to the tracks. The restaurant closed in August 2011 after 25 years of operation, reopening as Blue Restaurant. The northern of the line's two tracks has been taken up, and due to coastal erosion of the line's retaining wall, part of the trestle has slid into the Kill Van Kull along with some of the trackage east and west of here. Livingston is one of the stations to be returned to operation under the proposals for reactivation of the North Shore branch for rapid transit, light rail, or bus rapid transit service. Under the proposal, the right-of-way would be moved from the coastline to the parking lot site.

He praised the suite's firewall capabilities but criticized its antimalware capabilities. On 28 May 2009, Roboert Vamosi of PC World reviewed Comodo Internet Security 3.8 and gave it a score of 1 out of 5, criticizing it for its \\"disappointing malware detection\\" based on AV-TEST result and \\"limited feature set\\". Three years and three version later, Comodo Antivirus results became significantly better. On 30 January 2012, Rubenking reviewed Comodo Internet Security 2012 Pro (v5.0), giving it 4 stars out of 5.

During his career he played professionally for Borac Banja Luka, Zagreb, Celje and Prule 67. He won a total of 18 domestic trophies. He has won the elite EHF Champions League in 1992 and 1993, both times with Zagreb. He is one of very few handball players who represented three different countries at the Summer Olympics (Yugoslavia, Croatia and Slovenia), winning bronze with Yugoslavia in 1988 and gold with Croatia in 1996. In 2009, he was named the best overall player in the history of Slovenian handball. After his death an award named in his honour was introduced and is awarded annually to the most promising young handball players in Slovenia and Croatia, given alternately one year to Slovenian and another year to Croatian player. Early life Puc was born in Slovenj Gradec, SR Slovenia, SFR Yugoslavia on 14 September 1966. During his youth he lived in ≈†o≈°tanj with his mother and without his father, whom he met for the first time at the age of 25. In elementary school a gym teacher named Miro Po≈æun, who was aware of the situation at Puc's home, took young Puc under his wing and became his mentor. Po≈æun, who eventually became one of the best coaches in history of Slovenian handball, was the first who noticed the enormous talent that Puc had and eventually introduced him to the local handball club RK ≈†o≈°tanj, which he also coached. There Puc became the most promising young player of Yugoslav handball. Club career Puc was first noticed by RK Borac in 1983 when their goalkeeper, Yugoslav international Zlatan Arnautoviƒá, spotted him and reported his findings to the club officials. He was then tracked by the club and their scouting service and a few years later the young promising player was given an offer to join their club. Abas Arslanagiƒá, the coach of Borac, which was one of the top Yugoslav clubs at the time, wanted the young teenager to join his team immediately, however, Puc was persuaded by Miro Po≈æun to finish high school first and complete at least some form of education. Puc listened to his mentor, finished high school one year later and finally joined Borac in 1985 where he signed his first professional contract. Upon his arrival in Banja Luka, he immediately became the best player of the team and the best goalscorer of the entire league. Although he never won any major domestic honours with Borac, he is considered as one of the best players in the club's history. He later played for RK Zagreb from Croatia, and Celje and Prule 67 from Slovenia. During his career he won a total of 18 domestic trophies and was a member of the Zagreb squad which won the elite EHF Champions League in 1992 and 1993. He is most remembered for the game-winning goal in the 1993 Champions League final where he scored in the final seconds of the game. He has also won three Croatian league and three Croatian cup titles. His longest spell was with Celje, where he played for five years during which time he won five Slovenian league and five Slovenian cup titles and played in the EHF Champions League semi-final three times in a row. Miro Po≈æun was the head coach of Celje during the 1994‚Äì95 season with whom Puc won his first Slovenian league and cup title. He made a total of 136 appearances for Celje, scoring 630 goals in the process. Puc last played for Prule 67 where he won both domestic titles, league and cup, in the 2001‚Äì02 season and appeared in another Champions league semi-final one year later. International career His first taste of international success came at the 1987 Junior World Championship when Yugoslavia won gold, and Puc was noticed as the most prominent player of the winning team. Puc also captained his side during that tournament. One year later he won a bronze medal with the Yugoslav senior team at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. He played his last game for Yugoslavia at the 1990 World Championship where his team finished fourth. With 97 appearances, he is the third most capped Slovenian player in history of the Yugoslav national team. Following his move to RK Zagreb in 1990 and the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, Puc became a Croatian citizen and played for the Croatian team with whom he won a gold medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. He won two other medals in major tournaments with Croatia, a bronze medal at the 1994 European Championship and a silver medal at the 1995 World Championship. In 1995 he was awarded the Order of Danica Hrvatska, and in 1996 he was the recipient of the Franjo Buƒçar Award. In the late 1990s he switched his national side allegiance in favour of Slovenia, the country of his birth. He then played for the Slovenian team at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where the team finished eighth. Slovenia qualified for the Sydney tournament after finishing fifth at the 2000 European Championship. The fifth place play-off match was played in Zagreb against host nation Croatia, Puc's former team. Puc was one of the best players of the game and Slovenia won the match 25‚Äì24, thus securing the last available spot for the 2000 Olympics. He played 34 games for Slovenia, during which he scored 120 goals. Retirement After his retirement at Prule 67 he assumed the role of sports director at the club. Soon afterwards he moved to Florida together with his wife Jasenka, who is the daughter of the Croatian handball player and 1972 Olympic gold medalist Hrvoje Horvat, in support of their son's Borut tennis career. He and his wife sold all of their family possessions and enrolled their son to the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy. At the time of his father's death, Borut Puc was ranked 502nd on the ATP list with Goran Ivani≈°eviƒá as his tennis coach. Similar to his father, he also represented both Slovenia and Croatia. He started his career representing Slovenia and did so until the late 2000s (decade) when he changed his allegiance to Croatia. Illness and death In early 2011, Puc was diagnosed with lung cancer that spread to his liver and bones, and succumbed to the disease on 19 October 2011 in a San Diego hospital, just a few days before the Champions League game between Zagreb and Barcelona, with the revenue of the match intended to be donated to help cover the costs for his treatment. On 5 November 2011, a Handball Day was held in Celje, Slovenia, where two matches were played. In the first one, the 2000 Olympics Slovenian squad beat the Croatian squad composed of players who won the 1996 Olympic gold medal 29-25, while in the second match the regular squad of Slovenia beat the squad of Celje 35‚Äì32. This event was organized prior to Puc's death and matches would have been played even if he would still had been alive, as the main purpose was to gather donations for Puc and his family as financial aid for his treatment. Organizers collected around 17,000 euros and the revenue was bestowed on Puc's family. At the end of the match, which was seen by 4,000 spectators, the arena was completely dimmed. He is survived by his wife Jasenka and son Borut, a tennis player who resides in Florida, where the family moved to in 2005. Legacy Despite being known for his relaxed approach to training, Puc was described as a fiercely competitive and mentally tough player. At the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the Handball Federation of Slovenia in 2009, Puc was named the best left back and the best overall player in the history of Slovenian handball. Three days after his death, his former club RK Zagreb hosted Barcelona in an EHF Champions League match at Arena Zagreb. A clip of his match-winning goal for Zagreb in the 1993 EHF Champions League final was shown and 15,000 people joined in a minute-long standing ovation in his memory. In 2011 the Slovenian Olympic Committee together with the Croatian Olympic Committee and in collaboration with the Handball Federation of Slovenia and Croatian Handball Federation, introduced a joint award named in honour of Puc (Iztok Puc Award) that is awarded annually to the most promising U‚Äì18 handball player. The award is alternating between the two nations every year and is given alternately one year to Slovenian and another year to Croatian player.

Here, a homogenous status of a variable is a state which can be described by a set of coefficients of a formula. For example, of homogenous statuses, we can bring status of constant ('ON' of a switch) and linear (60 miles or 96 km per hour for speed). Mathematically, a segment is a function mapping from a set of times which can be defined by a real interval, to the set Z [Zeigler76],[ZPK00], [Hwang13]. A trajectory of a system variable is a sequence of segments concatenated. We call a trajectory constant (respectively linear) if its concatenating segments are constant (respectively linear). An event segment is a special class of the constant segment with a constraint in which the constant segment is either one of a timed event or a null-segment. The event segments are used to define Timed Event Systems such as DEVS, timed automata, and timed petri nets.  Event segments  = Time base = The time base of the concerning systems is denoted by \\\\mathbb{T} , and defined \\\\mathbb{T}=[0,\\\\infty) as the set of non-negative real numbers. = Event and null event = An event is a label that abstracts a change.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). This protein is a member of the MRP subfamily which is involved in multi-drug resistance. This protein is thought to form ATP-sensitive potassium channels in cardiac, skeletal, and vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle. Protein structure suggests a role as the drug- binding channel-modulating subunit of the extrapancreatic ATP-sensitive potassium channels.

Colony Shale Oil Project was an oil shale development project at the Piceance Basin near Parachute Creek, Colorado. The project consisted of an oil shale mine and pilot-scale shale oil plant, which used the TOSCO II retorting technology, developed by Tosco Corporation. Over time the project was developed by a consortium of different companies until it was terminated by Exxon on 2 May 1982 a day which is known amongst locals as \\"Black Sunday\\". History The project started in 1964 when Tosco, Standard Oil of Ohio, and Cleveland Cliffs Iron Company formed the Colony Development joint venture. The aim of the newly formed joint venture was to develop the Colony Oil Shale Project and to commercialize the TOSCO II technology. Starting in 1965 the consortium operated a shale oil pilot plant and in 1968 the Colony Development started preparations to build a commercial-scale plant. In 1969 Atlantic Richfield Company joined the project acquiring part of Tosco's stake. However the commercial project was delayed by economic uncertainties and then resurrected in the 1970s after the Arab oil embargo. In 1972 the consortium stopped the pilot plant and the development of the commercial plant was suspended in November 1974 when more detailed economic studies indicated a more than three times higher cost than previously anticipated. In 1974 Ashland Oil and Shell Oil Company joined the project. In the late 1970s Standard Oil of Ohio, Cleveland Cliffs Iron Company, Shell and Ashaland Oil sold their shares to Atlantic Richfield Company. As a result of these transactions Tosco owned 40% of shares and Atlantic Richfield Company owned 60% of shares in the project. In 1980 Atlantic Richfield Company sold its share to Exxon for $300 million. In 1981 the Colony Development started a construction of the commercial scale shale oil plant. On 2 May 1982 Exxon announced the termination of the project because of low oil-prices and increased expenses laying off more than 2,000 workers resulting in the date becoming known among locals as \\"Black Sunday\\". According to the shareholders agreement in a case of project termination Exxon had an obligation to buy out Tosco's shares. It paid $380 million worth of compensation. During its existence the project produced of shale oil. Location The Colony Development's property located in the southern edge of the Piceance Basin in northwestern Colorado, approximately west of Denver. It located next to the Union Shale Oil property, developed by Unocal Corporation. Technical description The pilot stage of the project consisted of underground room- and-pillar type oil shale mine and aboveground shale oil pilot plant with input capacity of 1,000 ton of oil shale per day which used TOSCO II retort a horizontal rotating kiln-type retort classified as a hot recycled solids technology. Mining was conducted in a -thick portion of the Mahogany Zone in the Parachute Creek Member of the Green River Formation at depths of and by a one-bench system. Pillar dimensions were by and rooms were wide. The planned commercial scale plant was to contain six TOSCO II retorts with total input capacity of 66,000 ton of oil shale per day. The proposed plant was to produce about of shale oil per day. The project was also to consists of shale oil upgrading plant for hydrogen treating to remove nitrogen and sulfur compounds. This plant was scheduled to produce about of premium petroleum products, 52,000 long ton of sulfur, and 41,000 long tons of ammonia per year. At the moment of cancellation the estimated costs would exceed $5.5 billion in then- year dollars or about $10 billion in 2005 dollars.

It was a spur route of U.S. Route 9 (US 9) that largely followed the eastern bank of the Schroon River. The southern terminus of the route was at NY 8 in the town of Horicon near the hamlet of Starbuckville. Its northern terminus was at US 9 in the Chester hamlet of Pottersville. NY 9M was known as East Schroon River Road and Glendale Road and crossed over the southern tip of Schroon Lake. NY 9M was assigned to what had been designated as legislative Route 22-c from 1913 to 1921. It lasted for less than a decade as it was removed . Its former routing is now maintained by Warren County as part of three county routes, namely County Route 55 (CR 55), CR 62, and County Route 64\\\\. Route description NY 9M began at an intersection with NY 8 (now CR 53) north of the hamlet of Starbuckville in the town of Horicon. The route followed Valentine Pond Road north for a negligible distance, then progressed westward along the eastern bank of the Schroon River on East Schroon River Road. Across the river, Carl Turner Road, a locally maintained highway, followed a routing parallel to that of NY 9M on the other shore. Both roads gradually curved northward, mirroring a similar turn in the river's course. Carl Turner Road came to an end here; however, NY 9M continued on. Near a junction with modern-day Short Street, NY 9M began to deviate from the river. North of Short Street, NY 9M curved back to the northwest, passing Smith Pond and traveling through woodlands as it approached Schroon Lake. It then crossed over the southern tip of the lake and entered the town of Chester on the opposite bank. The route came to an end shortly afterward at a junction with US 9 in the hamlet of Pottersville. History In 1913, the New York State Legislature created Route 22-c, an unsigned legislative route extending from State Highway 1023 (later NY 8 and now CR 53) near Starbuckville to legislative Route 22 (modern US 9) in Pottersville. The Route 22-c designation was eliminated on March 1, 1921, as part of a partial renumbering of New York's legislative route system. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, hundreds of state-maintained highways that did not have a signed designation were assigned one. The former routing of legislative Route 22-c was designated as NY 9M by the following year. NY 9M was short-lived, however, as it ceased to exist . Its former routing is now maintained by Warren County as CR 55 from former NY 8 (CR 53) to East Schroon River Road, CR 64 from Valentine Pond Road to East Shore Road, and CR 62 from East Shore Road to US 9.

Club history A rugby union team has played in the Fishguard and Goodwick area since the first decade of the twentieth century, with the earliest photo showing a Goodwick Rugby Football team from the 1907/08 season. However, the first Fishguard team was formed sometime in 1887 during the 1887/1888 season.https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3061670/3061672/13/football Rugby football was suspended during both World Wars, but by the 1950s a joint Fishguard and Goodwick team was reformed and playing in minor leagues against local opposition, with their traditional rivals being St. Davids RFC. By the 1990s the club was a member of the Welsh Rugby Union and was playing in the Pembrokeshire League (Jewson League). With the introduction of the professional era, Fishguard and Goodwick found themselves in the West region of the WRU leagues, becoming a feeder club for the Scarlets. The last three years have seen the club finish in the mid to top regions of WRU Division Five West finishing third in the 2009/10 season. In 2011 the club benefited from a ¬£1.3 million grant to build a new sports facility for the area. Fishguard and Goodwick RFC contributed ¬£50,000 to the build, which included ¬£20,000 from the Millennium Stadium Charitable Trust, a grassroots improvement scheme which is funded through all ticket sales from the National Stadium. The new centre included new team changing rooms and a referee changing room for use by the club. During the 2012-2013 season, Fishguard and Goodwick RFC reached the final of the SWALEC Bowl competition, with the final being held at the Millennium Stadium. They lost 27-17 to Wattstown RFC, however it is the highest achievement the club has to date, with no other Pembrokeshire club having reached any national final.

The second USS Mystery (ID-2744), often identified as SP-2744, was a minesweeper support ship that served in the United States Navy from 1918 to 1919. thumb Mystery was built in 1886 by A. C. Brown at Tottenville, New York, as a commercial fishing trawler. The 3rd Naval District inspected her on May 7, 1918 for possible World War I U.S. Navy service. The Navy chartered her from Empire Water Co., Inc., of New York City on 18 July 1918, took her over 20 August 1918, assigned her Identification Number (ID. No. 2744) and commissioned her as USS Mystery (ID-2744) on 2 September 1918. Confusingly, the designation \\"SP-2744\\" was painted on her bow and this designation is reported as her official one by many sources,See, for example, the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships (at http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m16/mystery-ii.htm) and Navsource Online (at http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/172744.htm). although this contradicted her official data card, which identifies her as \\"Id.

In 1908 the congregation moved into a new temple at Crawford at Lamar Street, in an area that was a Jewish community. After the congregation left the Lamar site, the New Day Temple occupied it. The Grove at Discovery Green occupies the former Lamar site. A new temple at Austin Street and Holman Avenue was dedicated in 1925.

The former Temple Beth Israel, the annex since 1966 for HISD's vocational San Jacinto High School [renamed Houston Technical Institute on June 1, 1971], seemed best suited for HSPVA's temporary use. Despite five years of district neglect, the sanctuary, attached two-story Levy Memorial Hall, and adjacent one-story Mendelsohn Education Building had the essential components for a small arts high school; use of this campus would only be necessary until HISD could pass a bond issue including funds for a new state- of-the-art building (...)\\" >>.

In the years leading to 1967, the Jewish community was moving to Meyerland. To follow the community, in 1967 the congregation moved to a new temple on North Braeswood Boulevard. The former temple building on Austin Street became the first home of Houston's High School for the Performing and Visual Arts and was renamed the Ruth Denney Theatre. When the high school moved to new quarters, the building became a performance venue for Houston Community College's Central Fine Arts division and was renamed the Heinen Theatre.

History  On February 22, 1974, the Central Iowa Railway took over operations of a 63.41-mile branch line that its owners had purchased from the line's former owner, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. The Central Iowa operated in Amish-settled country and had one locomotive: a 600-horsepower EMD SW1 that formerly had been owned by the Burlington Northern Railroad. The railroad's founders gave the blue and black SW1 locomotive the unusual unit number of J33-3 after verse 33:3 in the Book of Jeremiah in the Bible, which says, \\"Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.\\"Trains magazine, January 1974, p. 14. The Central Iowa Railway was headquartered at 425 B Avenue in Kalona, Iowa, and its president was Harlan A. Stubbs (1909-2003). Extending south and west from Hills, the railroad's freight stations were in the towns of Hills, Riverside, Kalona, Wellman, Kinross, South English, Webster, Keswick, Thornburg, Gibson, Barnes City and finally, Montezuma. The Central Iowa Railway was short-lived; it couldn't cover its costs and suspended operations in October 1974. The Central Iowa Railway is not to be confused with the Des Moines and Central Iowa Railway, which now is part of the Union Pacific Railroad, or with the Central Railroad of Iowa, which operated in Iowa in the 1800s.  Abandonment  The federal government formally approved abandonment of the Central Iowa Railway's entire 63.4-mile line between Hills and Montezuma on May 4, 1978. The tracks were later removed. A small section of track just south of Hills, Iowa remained in place until it was removed in June 1992, however.  Today  The Central Iowa Railway's line never was brought back into service, and its right-of-way largely reverted to adjacent farms. However, the Central Iowa's connection to the outside world, at Hills, changed hands in 1980, when the trustees of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad sold the Rock Island's 7-mile line between Hills and Iowa City to the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City Railway. The CRANDIC owns the Hills-Iowa City line to the present day. Until 2018 the line was operated by the Iowa Interstate Railroad from its own yard in Iowa City. Since then the CRANDIC has once again assumed operations with a captive locomotive interchanging cars with the IAIS at Iowa City.

Passenger traffic ceased in 1962 and all services were withdrawn in 1988. The line was then dismantled.  Planning and construction  Originally there were plans in which Aidenbach was seen as the crossing station on a line from Vilshofen via Aidenbach to Pfarrkirchen. The railway from Landau an der Isar to Kr√∂hstorf was to be extended to Aidenbach. In that way a local railway network and diversionary route would have been achieved. Aidenbach station in 2001 On 6 January 1883 a meeting took place in Aidenbach, which discussed the construction of a railway from Vilshofen via Aidenbach to Pfarrkirchen. This had been set up by the Gutsinspektor of the Aretin estates in Haidenburg, Baron von Hafenbr√§dl. Led by Reichsrat Aretin they decided, to send a petition to the Royal Bavarian State Government in Munich. On 29 February 1884 the railway committee responsible considered this Sekund√§rbahn ('secondary line'). However, according to a statement by the committee spokesman, Freiherr von Soden, a plan had already been agreed in 1869, in which this option had no place. On the contrary, the Rot Valley railway between Neumarkt-St. Veit and Pocking had been built in 1879; and the Pocking‚ÄìPassau route was established in 1888. On 17 May 1885 representatives of the local communities gathered in Aidenbach to form a committee for the construction of a Lokalbahn ('local line'). Their plan envisaged a stub line from Vilshofen to Aidenbach. Farmers and businessmen provided the incentive. They argued that they could transport their products more easily on the railway. Once again they submitted a resolution to the Royal Ministry of Transport in Munich for building this 12.5 kilometre long route and offered financial support. The county (Kreis), district and private investors put up 31,000 marks. In addition, Aidenbach said it was prepared to make land available for the line, and to provide 100,000 bricks free of charge for the construction of Aidenbach station. On 16 March 1896, after planning had been completed, land purchased, the donated real estate from Aidenbach and Vilshofen acquired, profitability calculated and many other processes concluded, the Royal Bavarian State Railways in Munich gave permission for the construction of the line. The line was tested with a technical trial run by state railway management on 12 November 1898 and on 21 November 1898 it was opened for public services. The total cost of the line, including structures, came to 744,086 marks.  Operations  Trains needed about 35 minutes to travel the 12.5 kilometres. The goods-only stop of Taferl at kilometre marker 4.0, with it extensive industrial railway system (Feldbahn), acted as a transhipment site for the adjacent granite works and was served daily by goods trains. The cost of the line had been covered within ten years.  Closure  The growth of private transport in the second half of the 20th century led to a sharp decline in the numbers of passengers. The Deutsche Bundesbahn reacted by reducing services. In the 1960 summer timetable only one pair of trains ran daily on workdays. On 12 October 1961 the railway division responsible, the Bundesbahndirektion Regensburg, started moves for withdrawing passenger services; this was finally agreed by their management on 18 July 1962 and the Federal Transport Minister on 14 September 1962. As a result, passenger traffic ceased on 30 September 1962. By contrast, the situation for goods traffic was initially much better. Admittedly, since the cessation of granite transportation, the trains carried little else but agricultural produce, but this was so much in demand, that the Deutsche Bundesbahn decided in 1985, to continue maintaining the track which, in places, was in very poor condition. In the first two kilometres alone, 700,000 DM were invested. However, no work was carried out on the second section, when the sugar beet firm cancelled its existing contract with the Bundesbahn. Because the transportation of sugar beet had amounted to over half the annual revenue, in spring 1987 steps were taken to close the line entirely. On 30 December 1987 the last train ran from Aidenbach to Vilshofen and on the 31 December 1987 the branch line was finally closed. Today about half the former trackbed has been converted into a footpath and cycle way.

Adherents of Azraqism participated in an armed struggle against the rulers of the Umayyad Caliphate, and they declared those who avoided this duty infidels - kafirs - and allowed their murder. Nafi ibn al-Azraq even permitted the killing of women and children of his opponents. At the same time, the Azraqites did not extend the principle of killing ‚Äúapostates‚Äù to Christians and Jews, since they believed that they did not betray the teachings of the prophets Jesus and Moses. Like all Kharijites, they declared Muslims who committed great sins (al-KabƒÅ'ir) to be unfaithful, and claimed that they would eternally suffer in hellfire. The Azraqites denied the principle of ‚Äúprudent concealment of faith‚Äù (takiya). They recognized the imamate as ‚Äúworthy‚Äù (  æaf·∏çal), that is, the applicant who would come up with arms and call people to fight ‚Äúunbelievers‚Äù and would not allow the imamate to be ‚Äúsurpassed‚Äù ( maf·∏ç≈´l). Based on this, they declared the caliph Ali ibn Abu Talib, Uthman ibn Affan and their adherents unbelievers. The Azraqites considered the territories beyond their control to be the \\"land of war\\" ( DƒÅr al-·∏§arb), and its population was subject to extermination. History In the 680s, Nafi ibn al-Azraq at the head of a 30 thousand-strong army launched an uprising in Iraq, directed against both the Umayyads and Shiites. The Kharijites of Oman and Yamama joined the rebels. Nafi ibn al-Azraq marched from Basra to Ahwaz and took control of it along with Fars and Kirman. Freeing slaves and acting as defenders of the oppressed, the Azariqa found support among the rural population of the Umayyad Caliphate, mainly among the Persians. However, their fanatical intolerance and cruelty towards those who did not share their views narrowed the social base of the movement. In addition, hostility broke out between the Persians and Arabs in the Azraqite camp itself. After the death of Nafi ibn al-Azraq in 685 at the Battle of Dulab, the leadership was passed on to Ubayd-Allah ibn al-Makhuz. For months the region between Basra and Ahwaz was the theater of plunder and destruction; General Al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra defeated and killed Ubayd-Allah ibn al-Makhuz in battle near Dujail (686). He was succeeded by his brother Zubayr ibn al-Makhuz, who reorganized his forces, returning to Iraq from where he had to retreat. Zubayr died in an attack on Isfahan (687 or 688), and his men scattered, fleeing to Fars and Kirman. Qatari ibn al-Fuja'a al-Mazini was chosen as the leader of the Azraqites, who accepted the title of caliph and \\"emir of believers\\". He oversaw the reorganization of the Azraqites and began minting his name on coins in 688, continuing for 9 years. He eventually occupied Ahwaz and returned to Iraq, moving in the direction of Basra. Subsequently, the governor of Mosul al-Muhallab ibn Abu Sufr was sent against the Azraqites, who had now been waging armed struggle against the state for 19 years. Government forces began to achieve relative success only after 694 AD, when Yusuf al-Hajjaj was appointed governor of Iraq. Al-Hajjaj's military successes complemented the subversive activities of al-Muhallab: he sent fake letters to the Qatari camp with thanks and money for the allegedly rendered services; sent allegedly naive people with tricky questions, the solution of which caused controversy and even a split between the Kharijites. Disagreements of a theoretical, legal and theological nature fueled the already existing dissatisfaction with the figure of Qatari and his entourage: many believed that the commander was arbitrary, did not take into account the opinion of the community, executed the innocent and pardoned the guilty of his own entourage. To this was added the differences between the Arabs and the Mawlas, whom the Arabs considered lower in position, but which made up 2/3 of the Qatari troops. The Kharijite attack on Sabur on Eid al-Adha (20 March 696) was repelled; the units that retreated along the road to Shiraz were again defeated and moved to Istakhr. After a siege, which dragged on for several months, the Azraqites left the city and, having arranged a pogrom to punish the inhabitants for relations with al-Muhallab, took refuge in the town of al- Bayda. Several battles occurred around al-Bayda, after which the Azraqites surrendered the city, retreating to the east. This series of defeats undermined the morale of the Azraqites; discontent with the leader resulted in open accusations and disobedience. There was a proposal to abandon the caliphate and transfer powers to a more worthy person; Qatari agreed to transfer the authority to a certain al-Muka'tari al-Abdi, which led to even greater dissatisfaction and the split of the troops into 3 camps. About 7-8 thousand soldiers swore allegiance to Abd Rabbihi al-Cabrir, 4 thousand to Abd Rabbihi al-Sagir, and only 4 thousand remained with Qatari. The first 2 groups were mainly Mawlas, the last - Arabs. These Azraqite groups came together in Jefrud-e Bala in a battle in which the Qatari supporters won, al-Kabir retreated, and al-Sagir died. A full-fledged Azariqa army, however, ceased to exist, so Qatari, with only fragments of his detachment left, retreated north to the mountains of Tabaristan. The region recognized the caliph's power only nominally, providing the Azraqites with protection. The majority of the Azraqites pledged themselves to Abd Rabbihi al-Kabir as the new caliph, which caused dissatisfaction with Atiyah, who claimed the same title. There was a quarrel during which al-Kabir killed Atiyah, after which the supporters of Atiyah left the Azraqite camp and came to al-Muhallab asking for pardon, which they received. Even with such an advantage, al-Muhallab did not seek to force events and waited for further splits among the Azraqites. He managed to cut off the food supply to the Azraqite camp, turning the city of Jefrud-e Bala into a trap. One by one the attempts to break the siege ended in failure, and famine began. In the last, desperate attempt to break the blockade, the Azraqites were finally defeated and left the battlefield, leaving 4,000 dead on it, among whom was Abd Rabbihi al-Kabir himself. Al-Muhallab showed mercy to those who surrendered, and even allowed relatives to take wounded enemies for healing, provided that they renounce their \\"harmful beliefs\\", those who did not would be executed. The families of the slain Azraqites became the prey of the victors. In the spring of the next year, al-Hajjaj called al-Muhallaba for a report, allowing him to leave as governor anybody he wanted; he chose his son Yazid. During this time, Qatari managed to get the better of Tabaristan's terrain, which sheltered him, and Sufyan ibn al-Abrad was sent to crush the revolt with a detachment of Syrian cavalry. No details about the hostilities in Tabaristan are reported, even the death of Qatari is described in different ways, the only things being known for certain that he died with a broken hip and was killed by a Mawla named Bazam. A breakaway faction from Qatari, led by Ubaid, was besieged by Sufyan in one of the fortresses of Kumis. Nobody reacted to the offer of a pardon in exchange for the execution of the instigators, and when all the food ran out and all the horses were eaten, the Azraqites left the fortress and gave their last battle, in which Ubaid died. In the 8th ‚Äì 9th centuries, the Azraqites continued to hold a presence in Iran, where Sistan was their center of operations. In Southern Iraq and Khuzistan, the Zanj Rebellion continued for 14 years, the leader of which was the azariqa Ali ibn Muhammad. To date, this sect has no followers and it is considered to have disappeared. References * Lewinstein, Keith. \\"AzƒÅriqa.\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE.

It is located on the campus of the SUNY Polytechnic Institute Colleges of Nanoscale Science and Engineering in Albany, New York, United States. The school opened in September 2007 with a first class of 40 students. Its first class graduated in June 2011 on the campus of the University at Albany. History The idea for a high-tech consortium school arose around 2003, according to former Supterintendent of Capital Region BOCES (Board of Cooperative Educational Services), a regional entity serving multiple school districts, Barbara Nagler, and Superintendent of Questar III, James Baldwin. Former Governor George Pataki signed a bill which established TVHS in November 2005. By November 2006, the board of education was named and given the tasks of creating a curriculum around project-based learning, working more closely with local businesses and places of higher education than typical public schools, and spreading the lessons learned on this new form of education to the component school districts of Capital Region BOCES and Questar III. Board of education members were selected from the boards of education of Capital Region BOCES and Questar III. Also in that month, the principal, Daniel Liebert, and director of institutional advancement, Raona Roy, were named. The school opened in September 2007, leasing space from MapInfo in the Rensselaer Technology Park in North Greenbush. TVHS has since moved to a permanent location on the East Campus of SUNY Albany, located in Albany. Administration Tech Valley High is not under the jurisdiction of one school district, as is the case of almost all high schools in New York. Rather it is a consortium high school available to any student from any of the component school districts of two Boards of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) in New York's Capital District: Capital Region BOCES and Questar III (Rensselaer-Columbia-Greene BOCES). Any student may apply during eighth grade to attend Tech Valley High for their high school career. The participating component districts respectively determine how many slots they will each support, and then students are selected by lottery. Students are not required to pay tuition to attend TVHS; the student's home school district pays its respective BOCES (Capital Region or Questar III, depending on location) tuition for the student to attend the school. Curriculum All public high schools in New York State are required to follow standards set forth by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York, under the direction of the Commissioner of Education and the New York State Education Department. This includes requirements for students to take and pass Regents Examinations. While in traditional high schools, students are taught in classrooms with homework, examinations, projects, and note-taking, TVHS bases its curriculum on project-based learning in a high-tech setting. TVHS fulfills its students' foreign language requirement by offering Mandarin Chinese. Even though students spend all four years of their high school career at TVHS, their diploma actually comes from their home school district.

Eventually she hears that he has drowned and mourns him. History The song was printed in eighteenth-century broadsides and collected by W. Percy Merrick in 1899 from Henry Hills of Lodsworth, Sussex. It was published in the Penguin Book of English Folk Songs and recorded in 1960 by A. L. Lloyd for the album A Selection from the Penguin Book of English Folk Songs. It was subsequently recorded by Judy Collins on her album A Maid of Constant Sorrow in 1961 and Martin Carthy for his Second Album in 1966 with his then playing partner violinist Dave Swarbrick. It is probably from one of these sources that the song was learnt by Sandy Denny who sang it in her solo career and then brought it to the band Fairport Convention, where with Swarbrick guesting on violin and Richard Thompson on guitar, it was released on the band's 1969 Unhalfbricking album. The eleven-minute version, regarded as a pivotal step in the development of British folk rock, was recorded in one take. It was a recording which marked the beginning of British folk rock, leading to the seminal album Liege & Lief later that year. British music website Uncut describe the track as: \\"11 minutes of seething cymbal washes on a Celtic drone chord sequence, erupting into a middle section where squalling crosswinds are traded between Richard Thompson and guest fiddler Dave Swarbrick.\\" Variants The following can be seen as variants of the song: *\\"Sailor Boy\\" (America) *\\"Black Is the Color (of My True Love's Hair)\\" (America) *\\"The Lost Sailor\\" (Australia) *\\"The Pinery Boy\\" *\\"Willie the Bold Sailor Boy\\" *\\"Sailor on the Deep Blue Sea\\" (America) *\\"Sweet William\\" *\\"Willie Boy\\" (America) Discography *A.

In addition, she became even more well known because of her vote to pass the civil unions bill out of Judiciary Committee so it could be heard by the entire House of Representatives. It was during her freshman years when her persistent efforts to increase transparency and accountability in state government earned her the \\"Miss Transparency\\" title, for enacting two important pieces of legislation that required the state to post expenditure and revenue data of state departments online. The first was the \\"Transparency Online Project\\" or TOP and is linked to the state's website and legislative website. 2010 Legislation HB10-1140 Construction of National Guard Readiness Centers ‚Äì The bill creates Readiness Centers in various locations around the state for Colorado Army and Air National Guard.

While supporting civil unions, she acknowledged the importance of protecting the Colorado Constitutional Amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman. She was honored for her vote by the Allied Jewish Federation of Colorado.GOP‚Äôs Nikkel honored for yes vote on civil unions KDVR.com ‚Äì Denver News, Weather & Sports from FOX 31 News in Denver, Colorado Nikkel's attempt to put Department of Higher Education information online failed, along with roughly 30 other measures, when a partisan impasse arose regarding the civil unions bill and the Republican Speaker, Frank McNulty, allowed all pending legislation to die so as to prevent debate on the bill. The delay triggered a special legislative session. In the special session of the General Assembly, Speaker McNulty sent the civil unions bill to the conservative State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee which functioned as a \\"kill committee,\\" permanently avoiding a vote by the House. Most remaining measures followed normal procedures. During the 2012 session, Nikkel worked work to help protect Colorado youth and stop the over-criminalization of them in the state. Nikkel's Direct File Reform bill HB12-1271 was passed in 2012. It was fought by the Colorado District Attorney's Council and the Attorney General but Nikkel passed it with broad bi-partisan support and the bill was signed into law. It reversed legislation exacted in 1993 which gave district attorneys sole power and discretion to charge youth as adults. Nikkel's bill took away that sole discretion and instead required that youth get a hearing so that \\"judicial review\\" and \\"due process\\" occurred. She helped enact SB12-046, the Discipline in Public Schools bill to get rid of \\"zero tolerance\\" policies in Colorado schools that were giving youth criminal records for minor problems. The bill was also killed during the civil unions \\"impasse\\" in the 2012 session but was resurrected and combined into the 2012 School Finance Act which was passed during the subsequent 2012 Special Session that Governor Hickenlooper called for to deal with important legislation that was killed. 2012 Legislation HB12-1271 - Juvenile Direct File Limitations - the bill reformed the law which allows district attorneys to charge youth as adults and \\"directly file\\" them into adult court. HB1271 limited the offenses whereby youth could be charged as adults to only the most heinous crimes. It required use of judicial review in all cases where youth could be charged so that due process is preserved, allowing both sides of a case to be heard by a judge. Prior to that, youth did not get a hearing, and instead, only got a sentencing hearing. HB12-1023 - Fallen Heroes Vehicle License Plate - created a license plate any Coloradan could purchase which required some proceeds go to a family survivors group to help families of fallen law enforcement officers. The intent of the plate is to pay tribute to any fallen hero, including soldiers and firefighters. HB12-1146 - Dropout Recovery Act - allowed the use of district monies that already exist to pay for a program to help high school dropouts between ages 17‚Äì21, or those at risk of dropping out, to enroll in a program at a local community college where they can get their diploma and concurrently enroll in college classes. HB12-1289- Auto Insurance Complaint Process - streamlined the process for consumers of auto insurance and providers so that issues relating to their insurance could be handled via mail, rather than going through a quasi judicial process. SB12-46 - Discipline in Public Schools - As a result of the findings of the task force from SB11-133 which included teachers, school administrators, law enforcement, restorative justice experts, counselors and legislators, this bill revamped the policies in Colorado where teachers were required to implement zero tolerance policies which over-criminalized Colorado youth. This bill was killed with other bills at end of session when an \\"impasse\\" was reached over civil union bill, but was resurrected and tacked onto Rep. Tom Massey's 2012 School Finance Act in the Special 2012 Session. HJR12-1008 - Fallen Soldiers Resolution - honored fallen Colorado soldiers during the Military Appreciation Day at the capitol - those who died while protecting their country. HJR12-1011 - CSU Founders Day - honored Colorado State University as a flagship university in Colorado. SJR12-028 - Child Abuse Prevention Month - highlighted April as Child Abuse Prevention month. HB12-1252 - Transparency of Higher Education - This bill was killed with other bills at end of session when an \\"impasse\\" was reached over civil union bill. It would have required institutions of higher learning to post information online regarding their expenditure and revenue data. =2012 election= In the 2012 General Election, Representative Nikkel announced she would not seek reelection. She was succeeded by Republican Perry L. Buck.

When the borough of West Bromwich was expanded in 1966 to include the former urban district of Wednesbury, Friar Park was placed within the boundaries of the Wednesbury township and has remained part of it ever since. However, an opposite reorganization took place in neighbouring Hateley Heath, which had previously straddled the borders of Wednesbury and West Bromwich, but now exists entirely within West Bromwich. Amenities There have been some more recent additions to the estate, including Carisbrooke House multi storey council flats, that were built in the 1960s on the north-east of the estate. However, these flats were demolished in 2001 in a controlled explosion, one of many tower blocks in the West Midlands which have been demolished since the 1980s. The low-rise blocks of council flats in Friardale Close, which were built in the 1960s, were demolished in 2004. Over the years, the council has decided to modernise the older houses, which form the nucleus of the estate, rather than to opt for demolition. In the 1980s, a small development of houses and flats was built off Carisbrooke Road, on land adjacent to the Tame Valley Canal. Joseph Edward Cox Infant and Junior Schools were built on the estate around 1930, to serve 5-11 year olds. The children were initially located in temporary buildings, before a permanent junior school opened in 1934 and an infant school in 1936. The schools have been completely rebuilt since the beginning of the 21st century and the name changed to The Priory Primary School. British History The Coronation public house was demolished in the 1990s and a Lidl supermarket now stands on the site. Most of the estate's shops around Carrington Road were demolished between 2010 and 2016 after standing empty since the 1990s. A bus in Friar Park. Bus route 40 connects Friar Park to Wednesbury and West Bromwich. Sociology A tragedy struck the estate on 21 December 1977, when a house in School Road caught fire. The fire took place during a national firefighters strike, and the Auxiliary Fire Service had to deal with the emergency call. The occupant of the house, 31-year-old Mrs Maureen Brazier, managed to escape the fire, but her four children Denise (aged 12), Suzanne (aged 10), Lisa (aged 6) and Tony (aged 4) were trapped inside and burnt to death, despite the efforts to save them by the Auxiliary Fire Service, as well as several neighbours, including one man who attempted to tackle the blaze with a garden hose. Mrs Brazier was later rehoused at another council property nearby, where she lived until her death in September 2013. The house in School Road was demolished in 1978, leaving a gap in the middle of the terrace where it once stood. Telegraph Unemployment rates in Friar Park have constantly been above the national average. the residential area was built during the Great Depression, and it had to endure another major economic blow in 1980, when the nearby Patent Shaft steelworks closed. Many other local factories were closed around the same time, as a result of the early 1980s recession. This coincided with a rise in crime and a host of other social problems on the estate during the 1980s. At the time of the 2001 census, it was reported that unemployment in Friar Park stood at 9.9% - more than double the national average and slightly above the average for Sandwell. It rose again in 2008 and 2009, due to another recession, although, by 2014, unemployment in the area was falling. Sandwell Council Crime rates in the Friar Park area have been very high for many years, with anti-social behaviour, drug abuse, burglary and violent crime being particularly widespread. The Coronation public house was the scene of regular violence and drug dealing, until its closure and demolition in the 1990s. Joyriding was also a major problem in the 1980s and 1990s, but has since fallen, with traffic calming measures on Carrington Road having contributed to a fall in speed-related accidents. UK Crime Statistics Cultural references Rap group Credit to the Nation filmed the video for their 1994 hit Sowing the Seeds of Hatred at various locations on the Friar Park estate, as well as on a bridge over the Tame Valley Canal near to the estate. Carisbrooke House multi-storey flats and the maisonettes which stood nearby were seen in the video, several years before they were demolished.

His evolution from unconventional doctrinal leanings to more orthodox and standard ones typified the moderation on both sides which led to reunion with the Old School Presbyterians in 1870. Duffield's grandfather, George Duffield II, had been Chaplain of the Continental Congress. Born July 4, 1794, in Strasburg, Pennsylvania, to a second George Duffield and his wife Faithful Slaymaker (a younger sister of Amos Slaymaker). He was the father of William Ward Duffield, Henry M. Duffield, and George Duffield V. Duffield graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1811. He studied theology in New York City under the preceptorship of John M. Mason and was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Philadelphia in 1815. He soon settled in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where he ministered nineteen years. There he wrote and published a book entitled \\"Regeneration\\" which caused some of the controversy leading to the Old School-New School Controversy that split the church in 1837. Duffield was called as minister to Fifth Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he stayed two years. Then, after passing one year in the ministry at Broadway Tabernacle Church in New York City, as co-pastor with Jacob Helffenstein and successor to Charles Finney, he accepted a call to the First Presbyterian Church in Detroit, Michigan, then called the \\"Protestant\\" church. There he grew disenchanted with the revivalist techniques of Finney and began to oppose his ministry. In 1847 he led the Detroit Presbytery to adopt a statement which censured Finney, entitled \\"A Warning Against Error.\\" In 1848, Finney published his 47 page response, \\"A Reply to Dr. Duffield's Warning Against Error.\\" Duffield also was a leading Presbyterian premillennialist, and in 1842 authored, Dissertations on the prophecies relative to the second coming of Jesus Christ. He was appointed to the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan on which he served ten years. His influence extended over the whole state of Michigan and made use of the press as well as the pulpit. He was learned in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, and German as well as English. He was a master of the sciences and had an unfailing memory. Duffield died as he had wished, \\"in the harness,\\" two days after addressing the 1868 International Convention of the Young Men's Christian Association at Detroit, where he paused suddenly, in the midst of his address, and fell with a cry of distress into the arms of those standing near him. His death was mourned throughout Detroit. Bibliography * Presbyterian Reunion: A Memorial Volume (1837‚Äì1871), DeWitt C. Lent & Company, 1870. * Hambrick-Stowe, Charles E., Charles G.

He came off the bench in the fifth game of the season, against Oregon State, after carrying just 13 times in prior games, to enjoy one of the greatest days in UCLA history. He went on to approach the 1,000 yard rushing mark for the season and earn second-team All-Pac-10 acclaim. Ebell enjoyed an outstanding spring practice, showing that he was becoming a complete player. His speed separated him from most backs and enabled him to be a threat to score anytime he touched the football. He also worked hard to become a good pass protector. =2002= Ebell earned second-team freshman All-America honors from The Sporting News in 2002 and was selected second-team all-conference by vote of the league coaches. He led the Bruins in rushing with 994 yards and was the leading scorer with 10 touchdowns (60 points). He was ranked fourth in the Pac-10 in rushing (76.5), fifth in punt returns (11.4), ninth in all-purpose yards (106.3) and 13th in total offense, despite not earning much playing time until the season's fifth game. In eight Pac-10 games, he carried 197 times for 876 yards and eight touchdowns (108.3 yards per game average). Ebell ended the season just six yards shy of becoming only the third freshman in Pac-10 history to rush for 1,000 yards. His 994 yards ranked 17th on the school single-season list, while his 1,382 all-purpose yards ranks No. 10 on the UCLA list. Ebell ranked seventh nationally among freshman rushers. He became the first freshman (true or redshirt) in school history to rush for at least 100 yards in six games (the old record was two, held by several players), all consecutive. He also set a new school freshman rushing record, breaking Eric Ball's old mark of 703 yards, set in 1985. Ebell was the first freshman since DeShaun Foster in 1998 to lead the team in rushing. His streak of six straight 100 yards games was the second-longest one-season streak in school history (Gaston Green did it seven times in 1986). On October, 5 at Oregon State, Ebell came off the bench in the second quarter following an injury to Manuel White to enjoy one of the greatest days in UCLA history. He rushed for 203 yards and one touchdown on 29 carries. His 203 yards ranked 14th on UCLA's single-season game list (second on UCLA's single-game freshman list). He ran for 45 yards on 12 attempts in the second quarter, 34 yards on eight carries in the third quarter and 124 yards on nine carries in the fourth quarter. His 73-yard fourth quarter rush to the one-yard line was the second longest ever by a Bruin freshman (83 yards by Derek Ayers vs. BYU in 1993). Ebell made the first start of his career against Oregon and ran for 119 yards (89 on 15 attempts in the second half) on 26 attempts. He also returned five punts for 64 yards. At Cal, he started and broke the 100-yard barrier for the third straight week, finishing with 102 yards on 28 attempts. He scored UCLA's only touchdown on an 11-yard run. Against Stanford, he rushed for 160 yards (fourth straight game over 100 yards) and the go-ahead touchdown on 39 carries, three shy of the school record for carries. In the second half, he carried 25 times for 118 yards. He carried the ball on 25 of UCLA's 33 offensive snaps (excluding two kneel downs at the end of the contest) in the second half of the game. In the fourth quarter, he carried on the final 12 snaps. At Washington, Ebell reached the 100-yard plateau for the fifth straight game, finishing with 102 yards and three one-yard touchdowns on 31 attempts. He had three double-figure runs, including rushes of 23 and 22 yards. At Arizona, he became only the second UCLA player in history to rush for over 100 yards in six consecutive games in the same season. Ebell finished with 124 yards and two touchdowns on 22 carries. He had four runs of at least 19 yards in the game. Against USC, he led the Bruins with 56 yards on 12 attempts. He had runs of 11 and 13 yards on UCLA's first possession of the second half, but carried just twice more with the Bruins facing a 35-7 deficit, He also made two receptions for 29 yards. Ebell was limited to 10 yards on nine carries in the Washington State game and caught four passes for two yards. He also returned two kickoffs for 43 yards. In the bowl game win over New Mexico, he ran for 70 yards on 25 carries and returned a punt for seven yards. He was named winner of the John Boncheff, Jr. Memorial Award for team Rookie of the Year on Offense. =2003= Ebell started eight games and rushed for 501 yards on 116 carries (4.3 average) with two touchdowns. He also made 10 receptions for 68 yards while splitting carries with Maurice Jones-Drew and Manuel White Jr. =2004= He transferred to the University of Texas at El Paso and sat out the season due to the NCAA transfer rules. =2005= Ebell started the first seven games and missed the rest of the season due to injury. He posted solid numbers despite the injury with 118 carries for 536 yards and 5 touchdowns, and 20 receptions for 250 yards. He earned 3rd team All-Conference, despite playing only three conference games. Professional career Ebell signed with the Edmonton Eskimos on May 28, 2007.Eskimos sign record-setting running back Tyler Ebell He led the 2007 team in combined rushing and receiving yards with 1318, and he was named team rookie of the year. On February 15, 2008, Ebell was traded, along with wide receiver T. J. Acree, to the Argonauts, for cornerback Jordan Younger. He missed the entire 2008 season after rupturing his achilles tendon during training camp. During the 2009 CFL season, Ebell started out with the Toronto Argonauts during pre-season but was surprisingly released at the end of training camp. On July 6, 2009, the BC Lions signed Ebell to help fill the role missed by the injury to Ian Smart and he was named the runner-up to the special teams player of week 3. Nonetheless, as Smart recovered, Ebell was first placed on the practice roster on July 22, 2009, and ultimately released on July 30. On October 27, 2009, Ebell was signed by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and added onto their practice roster. On November 15 he was added to the active roster for the East Semi-Final Playoff game versus the B.C. Lions.

P√©rez was his father's last name. He enlisted in the Cuban Army in 1949 after graduation from high school, when financial problems forced him to give up studying architecture at the University of Havana. In 1950, he was accepted as a cadet at the Military Academy, and, three years later, graduated with honors and was promoted to second lieutenant in the infantry. Soon afterwards, he left for the United States, in a program of US assistance to the Cuban Armed Forces. In the United States, he took a combat engineering course for field officers. He spent some time at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. During the next four years, from 1954 to 1958, San Rom√°n was an instructor in the combat engineering corps. In 1956, he was promoted to first lieutenant, second in command of a company. He went to the US Army Infantry Center at Fort Benning, Georgia, where he graduated from the infantry course for field officers. In 1957, in Cuba, an incipient guerrilla army was challenging the regular troops. For several months, San Rom√°n commanded a company in the zone of operations. There, he felt an aversion toward those military officers who carried out abuses and excesses against the civilian population. In 1958, he was appointed a professor at the Military Academy. That same year, he was promoted to captain and named G-3 of the Infantry Division, a post equivalent to lieutenant colonel. He was arrested in December 1958, accused of conspiring against the powers of the state. He had been involved in an assassination attempt against Batista. Because of that and his clean service record, San Rom√°n was later released and regained his rank after the Cuban Revolution. He formed part of the commission that was created to cleanse the Armed Forces, but was arrested and accused in Case 39/59 in April 1959. San Rom√°n had helped former Commander Ricardo Montero Duque to leave the country. Montero Duque was wanted by the revolutionary courts, accused of having committed abuses against the civilian population during his service in Oriente. In November 1959, P√©rez San Rom√°n left for the United States.Rodriguez, Juan Carlos. 1999. Bay of Pigs and the CIA. Ocean Press Melbourne. Page 79. In May 1960 he was one of a group of ten former Cuban officers in Miami, Florida, who were planning a campaign against the Castro regime. They were graduates of Cuba's military academy, the Cadet School. On 2 June 1960, San Rom√°n and nine fellow 'recruits', including his brother Roberto San Rom√°n, were transported by CIA agents to Useppa island off Fort Myers, Florida, for physical and psychological assessments. On 22 June 1960 San Rom√°n and 27 others were taken by land and air to Fort Gulick in Panama for paramilitary training. On 22 August 1960 he flew via CIA C-54 aircraft to San Jos√©, Guatemala. At the CIA-run infantry training base known as 'Trax Base' in the mountains near Retalhuleu, Pepe San Rom√°n was in charge of weapons and demolition training. In about November 1960 he was appointed Brigade 2506 commander with about 430 recruits in training. After the brigade had ceased fighting on 19 April 1961, the third day of the Bay of Pigs Invasion, San Rom√°n and his men scattered into the woods and swamps. He was captured by Cuban militia on 25 April 1961. He was finally released from prison and flown to Miami on 24 December 1962. On 29 December 1962, Pepe San Rom√°n was on stage next to the 35th US president, John F.

The population in 2011 was 1,809,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 117.59 km2.√Åreas das freguesias, concelhos, distritos e pa√≠s History The oldest record from this region, the Cart√≥rio Notarial de Tavira (of 10 April 1601) identified the organized settlement of Santa Catarina. The church was erected sometime in the 15th century, and complements the style of the parochial church of the Miseric√≥rida in Tavira, which itself was built at the end of the first half of that century. It is assumed that the parish was established sometime prior to the erection of the church. The oldest ecclesiastical records, the births, baptisms, marriages and deaths recorded from this parish correspond to evident from the Torre do Tombo, and situate the parish around 1632. Fonte do Bispo was a toponymic name referenced as early as the 14th century. The parish was named from Saint Catherine of Alexandria, who perished in 307 AD, referring to a legend stating that an image of Catherine appeared at the fountain of the bishop (): this gave rise to the regions name. Created from the ecclesiastical parish in 1835, this local authority's records were lost prior to 1886. Geography The typical rural farmhouse in the mountains of the Barrocal Santa Catarina is a small agglomeration of homes, situated on the edge of the Tavira-Loul√© roadway (the Estrada Nacional E.N. 270), approximately from the urban centre of Tavira. The famous Fonte do Bispo is located some distance from this road, along the rocky cliffs. The parish, is intimately associated with the region's soils. The southern part of the parish, south of the EN 270, is based in limestone, characterized by superficial deposits that extend from the sub-soils. To the north, and parallel the limestone areas, is a narrow strip of red sandstone, known as the gr√©s de Silves, locally referred to as arneiro or pedra amoladeira. To the north of this zone is a mountainous schist zone, with heavily carved valleys and rounded ridges. The limestone formation is named the Barrocal, and is occupied by orchards, olive trees, almond trees, figs and vineyards, in addition to the cultivation of cereal crops and legumes. The red sandstone gr√©s de Silves has also been used by locals for planting orchards, irrigated by rainwater collected from the slopes of the ridges. The ridge, including areas of the Barrocal and Arneiro, are alluvial zones; the mountains around these areas produce wheat, barley, vineyards and olive orchards. The Barrocal and Arneiro are zones of disperse settlements, homes isolated from one another, while in the mountain regions, the land is broken by more dense groupings of settlements. Consequently, a toponymic reference to sites () and mountain () settlements prevail. A s√≠tio is a determine area of the territory with disperse habitat, while the montes is a mountain-top locality, independent of the number of dwellings, but relying on its influence.

Only one was built. Development In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Willy Messerschmitt, working at Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFW) produced a series of low-wing sports monoplanes with either one or two seats. These were the M.19, M.23, M.27, M.31 and M.35 with the M.23 the only one with sales of much over double figures. The M, of course, stood for Messerschmitt. Like the M.27, the M.31 had the same wingspan as the M.23c. Like the M.23b and M.27, it was a tandem two-seat open cockpit monoplane machine, with a low cantilever wing and braced tailplane. The fuselage below the decking was more rounded than on the earlier aircraft, being built out of two longitudinal panels per side rather than one, with the lower one angled inwards. The fixed undercarriage was without the spats of the M.27. It was powered by a neatly cowled radial engine driving the usual two- blade airscrew. Some considered it to be the most elegant of the series. The first flight was in 1932, and it was on display at the German Aerosport exhibition of 1933. No orders were placed and only the prototype was built.

According to a comprehensive survey performed in 2006‚Äì2007, approximately half of American institutes of higher learning have something that can be identified as a WAC program.Thaiss, Chris, and Tara Porter. \\"The State of WAC/WID in 2010: Methods and Results of the U.S. Survey of the International WAC/WID Mapping Project.\\" College Composition and Communication. 61.3 (2010): 524‚Äì70.

Web. WAC, then, is a programmatic effort to introduce multiple instructional uses of writing beyond assessment.Gere, Anne Ruggles, ed. Roots in the Sawdust: Writing to Learn across the Disciplines. Urbana: NCTE, 1985. WAC has also been part of the student-centered pedagogies movement (student-centred learning) seeking to replace teaching via one-way transmission of knowledge from teacher to student with more interactive strategies that enable students to interact with and participate in creating knowledge in the classroom. This page principally concerns itself with WAC in American colleges and universities. WAC has also been important in Britain, but primarily at the K‚Äì12 level. History of WAC David Russell traces the history of WAC in the United States to the 1870s, the emergence of professional disciplines, and the new need for college-level instruction in writing.Russell, David R. Writing in the Academic Disciplines: A Curricular History. 2nd Ed. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 2002. Prior to this era, college students were exclusively (for all practical considerations) affluent white men whose natural discourse was identical to the approved discourse of the academy; therefore, their way of speaking and writing was already considered appropriate by and for the academy and composition didn't need to be taught at the college level. Two changes happened to motivate the need for college writing instruction. Firstly, as disciplines (as divisions within academic studies) and contemporary professions specialized, they developed their own specialized discourses. Because these discourses were not merely the same as the everyday discourse of the upper classes, they had to be taught. Secondly, as college students became more diverse ‚Äì first in terms of social background and, later, in terms of gender, race, and age ‚Äì not all college students grew up speaking the accepted language of the academy. First-year composition courses couldn't be about the content of the writing, because content was what the other disciplines taught. Composition, therefore, had to be about the form the writing took and so \\"writing\\" was reduced to mechanics and style. Because of this reduced focus and because writing was addressed by composition, other disciplines assumed no responsibility for writing instruction; most students, then, were not taught to write in the context of their specialties. As American education became increasingly skills-oriented following World War II ‚Äì in part a reaction to the suffusion of universities with war veterans in need of job training, in part a result of modeling education after the efficiency of Fordian factory production ‚Äì writing instruction was further reduced to a set of skills to be mastered. Once correct (that is, standard academic) grammar, punctuation, spelling, and style were mastered ‚Äì preferably before reaching the post-secondary level ‚Äì there was no need for additional writing instruction save as remedial education. This product-oriented, skills- focused paradigm of writing pedagogy began to change in the 1970s with the popularization of James Britton and colleagues' expressivist school of composition, which said that students benefited from writing as a tool for self-expression and that focusing on technical correctness was damaging. Janet Emig's 1977 article \\"Writing as a Mode of Learning,\\" grounded in constructivist theories of education, suggested that writing functioned as a unique and invaluable way for students to understand and integrate information. Simultaneously, widespread media attention around college students' apparently decreasing writing proficiency (more a product of the changing demographics of college students than an overt shift in teaching) provoked institutions of higher learning to reevaluate and increase the amount of writing required of students. Carleton College and Beaver College began what were probably the first contemporary WAC programs in 1974 and 1975, respectively, with faculty workshops and writing requirements shared across disciplines. Major theories WAC efforts are usually driven principally by one of two theories: writing to learn or on learning to write in disciplinary discourses, sometimes also called writing in the disciplines. Though both may be used together, one of the two theories generally guides any given writing assignment and, often, any given WAC course. =Writing to learn= Writing to learn is also occasionally referred to as the expressionist or cognitive mode of WAC.McLeod, Susan H. \\"Writing Across the Curriculum: An Introduction.\\" Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 1‚Äì11. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/ Writing to learn supports the use of mostly informal, often ungraded writing exercises to help students understand course content in non-English disciplines. Writing to learn assumes that being able to explain or express concepts in one's own words both builds and reflects understanding. Because the goal of writing to learn exercises is learning rather than a finished writing product, instructors are discouraged from paying attention to grammar and surface mechanics. The student himself or herself, not the teacher, is the audience. Common writing to learn exercises include reading responses, journals, free writing, and multiple forms of collaborative writing. =Writing in the disciplines= Writing in the disciplines is also occasionally referred to as the transactional or rhetorical mode of WAC.McLeod, Susan H. \\"Writing Across the Curriculum: An Introduction.\\" Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs.

Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/ Although WID and WAC are correlated, WID emphasizes disciplinary orientation. The students‚Äô participation in their majors enlists the students in discourse communities, which are social groups that communicate, at least in part, via written texts and share common goals, values, and writing standards. These writing standards include but are not limited to specialized vocabularies and particular genres.Academic Writing Program. \\"What is \\"Writing in the Disciplines?\\"\\" Faculty of Art and Science, Academic Writing Program. University of Lethbridge, 2006. The goal of WID is to allow students to demonstrate writing skills within the genres expected in academic and professional discourse communities.Charles Bazerman. Encyclopedia of English Studies \\"Writing in the Disciplines\\". Southern Illinois UP, 1993. Reflection is considered an essential component of critical learning and problem solving, and as such, is indispensable for Writing in the Disciplines. Reflection tasks stimulate students to look back on completed tasks such as writings done in their respective disciplines with the aim to understand their accomplishments and steer future actions. Students are commonly asked to work out these reflections in a writing task. The act of writing itself promotes learning in a particular discipline. They also find writing within a discipline leads students to deploy different productive approaches to learning that they might not have otherwise applied. Writing in the discipline courses are commonly referred to as Writing Intensive courses(WI). Writing Intensive courses were developed for two reasons: 1) Students' writing skills would decrease if not consistently reinforced. 2) Students' writing improves significantly when they write involving their major. The controversy surrounding WID is who holds responsibility for teaching WID courses. The different models for teaching WID classes are the following: 1) The English (or Writing) department faculty teaches writing courses focused on individual disciplines. 2) English (or Writing) departments and other discipline departments collaborate on instructing writing courses for particular majors. Peterson talks about how english assignments done in the freshman year will carry on and relate to the writing assignments during the rest of ones college career. What is learned in one course can carry on to other courses. This knowledge can be spread by working with colleagues in the same and other departments on assignments and class discussions. By doing this, departments can learn about the similarities and differences they have between them. 3) Individual faculty of respective disciplines teach writing for their respective disciplines. Each university decides which model works best for their institution. For example, The University of San Francisco has implemented model one to teach their Writing in Psychology course(RHET 203). Cornell University has used model two to teach their Technical Writing course(WRIT 7100). The University of Missouri employs the third model to teach their Process Synthesis and Design course - Writing Intensive(CH_ENG 4980W).  WID across the Globe  The University School of Business Administration (EAN) of Bogot√°, Colombia conducted a study where students took courses for writing in the disciplines. The study showed that writing in the disciplines had positive outcomes on students' performance. Students were split into writing courses based on their majors that would ultimately help them with discipline-specific writing. Courses offered for writing in the discipline included: Introduction to Administration, Principles and Theories of International Business, Economic Thought, Models of Organizational Communication and Foundation in Engineering. Not every major is the same, and there were some differences, the courses offered individual \\"work guides\\" for students so that they could focus more in-depth on writing in the discipline. The goal of this study was to help students read and write more critically and analytically.  WID in the US  The George Washington University located in Washington D.C. has successfully implemented a WID program in their undergraduate education. During students first year, freshman take First Year Writing which teaches students college level research and writing, rhetoric, and more. Peterson, Linda. \\"WAC and Freshman Writing.\\" Anticipating the difficulties, Avoiding the Pitfalls. (2012) 48 - 49. As students go on, they take two WID courses in different semesters at their time at the university. These courses show their students how to write in their respective disciplines and how to communicate in those disciplines as well. The WID program at this university is implemented at all departments and schools unlike the WID program at The University School of Business Administration (EAN) of Bogot√°, Colombia. The University of George Washington had WID in the Arts and Sciences, International Affairs, Public Health, and Engineering and Business schools. The university also has a writing center to further improve their students writing skills. The George Washington University has been in the US News and World Reports list for the success they have in their writing program. Scholars have come to an agreement that the act of writing itself promotes learning in the particular discipline. They also find writing within a discipline leads students to deploy different productive approaches to learning that they might not have otherwise applied. In addition, writing in the disciplines can enhance learning in that students were able to refer back to their own previous disciplinary writing work in a way that is agreeable because it is in their own words. Students tend to have a more streamlined mastery of their chosen discipline if offered early exposure to that particular discipline‚Äôs writing form. Studies have shown that students achieve a greater understanding of their discourse by engaging in dialogue with an accomplished figure within the discipline, as well as meaningful reading in order to emulate proper writing and discourse. Universities have begun initiating academic discourse partnerships between WID programs and writing centers with a focus on inclusivity for diverse student bodies. The goal of this inclusive-based approach to a writing center is for the tutor to guide the students to apply the characteristics of their background to learning and contributing to new discourse communities. Moreover, the inclusive tutoring style acts as an outlet for the student to reconsider their struggles as a normal part of the writing process.  Possible Drawbacks of WID  One of the possible problems of applying the curriculum may be how different schools define their English/ writing departments. Departments that narrowly focus on only \\"literary\\" reading and writing may have some difficulty adapting to a curriculum that contains non- literary subjects (such as organic chemistry). The teachers may lack confidence in their ability to teach such subjects, as they were not the focus within their personal educational career. Another issue that may arise is the lack of an all-encompassing education within the English department staff. Most literature professionals specialize only in English or literature, but the writing in the disciplines course demands that the teachers must have a very broad field of experience and choosing said curriculum might prove to be difficult. What constitutes a good organic chemistry report may be completely opposite of what a well written literary article constitutes and if a professor chooses a source that is not an accurate representation of the subject, then that particular segment of the course will be moot. A problem that may affect the students is the case of information overload. Heavy information load can confuse the individual, affect his or her ability to set priorities and make prior information harder to recall. Within a very short amount a time, students are expected to learn how to proficiently write for disciplines all across the board. Because of the very nature of the class, students may find the subject overbearing and difficult to navigate. Students‚Äô writing ability may not actually increase as they progress through upper- division writing classes. Instead, they may simply change their writing style to better fit the criteria of the reader/ teacher. Because of this, students can completely miss the point of WID classes and not learn the nuances between each discipline. WAC structure and implementation WAC may exist as a formal program housed in or attached to an English department, a formal program as a free-standing unit reporting directly to a dean or vice president, a program attached to an all-campus writing center, or an informal initiative in which faculty voluntarily participate. The WAC director, at most universities, is a tenure-track professor.Thaiss, Chris, and Tara Porter. \\"The State of WAC/WID in 2010: Methods and Results of the U.S. Survey of the International WAC/WID Mapping Project.\\" College Composition and Communication. 61.3 (2010): 524‚Äì70.

Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/ A major complaint against the workshop model of WAC is that it can encourage the mindset that writing pedagogy is relatively simple and can be mastered in a few days, whereas using writing effectively (in English or non-English classes) is widely recognized as taking years of practice.Ochsner, Robert, and Judy Fowler. \\"Playing Devil's Advocate: Evaluating the Literature of the WAC/WID Movement.\\" Review of Educational Research 74.2 (2004): 117 -140. Web. 1 Sept. 2011. =WAC in upper-division courses= On a programmatic level, WAC most often manifests as some kind of writing-intensive (also called writing- enriched or writing-in-the-major) courses. Courses carrying this designation typically meet university-wide criteria including a minimum number of pages or words students write over the semester (or some other measure of writing frequency), opportunity for revision, and deriving a significant portion of the final grade from writing. Writing-intensive courses also often have relatively small enrollment limits (15‚Äì35 students depending on institution) and may require faculty to participate in WAC-related professional development activities.Farris, Christine and Raymond Smith. \\"Writing-Intensive Courses: Tools for Curricular Change.\\" Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 71‚Äì86. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/ The rationale for writing-intensive coursework includes: * Writing practice ‚Äì as with any other skill, students' writing abilities will atrophy if they are left unpracticed; writing-intensive courses ensure that students continue to write after leaving first-year composition * Writing to learn ‚Äì contemporary composition theory holds that incorporating active writing promotes student engagement and, therefore, learning * Professionalization ‚Äì writing-intensive courses directed at upper-division major students provide an opportunity for students to learn the communication skills expected of professionals in their anticipated fields =WAC in first-year composition= While WAC is usually understood as distributing writing across the curriculum in courses outside of English departments, a WAC philosophy can also influence the structure of first-year composition courses. Because first-year composition is often the only writing course students take, the composition of the class can shape students' understanding of what writing is.Peterson, Linda H. \\"Writing Across the Curriculum and/in the Freshman English Program.\\" Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 58‚Äì70. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod- soven/ Incorporating writing from diverse academic genres can therefore expand students' expectations about what constitutes \\"writing.\\" WAC in first-year composition owes much to genre theory (genre studies) which asks students to think about the classification and rhetorical implications of writing within socially constructed genres.  Writing-Enriched Curriculum  Writing- Enriched Curriculum (or WEC) is a movement that scholars have recently started to implement in university programs across the U.S. With its basic premise reflecting WAC's integration of relevant writing throughout all student's courses, WEC aims to focus on faculty involvement and intense reflection upon devising a writing program that is effective and relevant for students in their various fields of study.. = Precursors of WEC = In the late 1990s, North Carolina State University developed an approach to writing across the curriculum that involved extensive consultation by writing experts with individual departments. These consultations began with a focus on the qualities and characteristics faculty felt that student majors would exhibit if they were strong communicators. Those discussions led to the articulation of learning outcomes for both writing and oral communication. The departments then developed implementation plans that could help them reach the outcomes, followed or preceded by plans for assessing student abilities in order to further refine or project plans for implementation. Carter, Michael (2003) A Process for Establishing Outcomes-Based Assessment Plans for Writing and Speaking in the Disciplines, Language and Learning Across the Disciplines, 6:1, 4-29. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/llad/v6n1/carter.pdf Anson, Chris M. (2006) Assessing Writing in Cross-Curricular Programs: Determining the Locus of Activity. Assessing Writing, 11, 100-112. The Campus Writing and Speaking Program, directed since 1999 by Distinguished Professor Chris Anson (www.ansonica.net), provided much of the support for this campus-wide approach. A few years into the program's existence, Anson and colleague Michael Carter (who is often credited with originating the departmentally- focused conversations on which WEC is founded) consulted with Pamela Flash at the University of Minnesota (where Anson had been a professor for 15 years) to help them spearhead a similar effort. Minnesota evolved the approach into a portable model, shifting from a focus on outcomes-oriented assessment to a faculty-driven, long-term process of sustainable curricular transformation). They branded their model, which is being implemented and adapted by an increasing number of institutions, \\"WEC.\\" WEC is both a specific model and a developing concept relating to WAC; the acronym was created by Pamela Flash and her colleagues at The University of Minnesota Flash, Pamela (2016) From Apprised to Revised: Faculty in the disciplines change what they never knew they knew. Available at https://wec.umn.edu/sites/wec.umn.edu/files/flash_chapter2016.pdf . Flash is the university's director of Writing Across the Curriculum, founding director of the Writing-Enriched Curriculum and co-director of the writing center.\\"Search Results\\", American Library Association, January 18, 2018. http://www.ala.org/search-results?as_q=%22writing%20enhanced%20curriculum%22 (Accessed April 20, 2018) Document ID: 019c5924-9dc0-4eaa-929a-9aeff57bd454 As a pioneer of the WEC writing instruction model, the University of Minnesota has had its faculty enroll up to 5 units of WEC plans per year into the undergraduate curriculum for up to 10 years. = The WEC model = According to the WEC website at the University of Minnesota , WEC is a faculty-driven method to ensuring the effective, intentional integration of relevant writing and writing instruction into disciplinary curricula. The WEC model created by Writing Across the Curriculum director Pamela Flash and colleagues and initially implemented by the University of Minnesota involves departmental faculty in developing a locally relevant Writing Plan. The outlining of plans is attempted through collaborative discussions between numerous departmental faculty and specialists in both writing and assessment and the consideration of previous attempts at effective writing instruction. Some of the content under consideration include writing assessments, locally collected data, stakeholder surveys and writing expectations from instructors. The outcome of this meetings is pronounced expectations and plans for relevant instructions to be implemented in the curricula. (Flash 2016 Fr o m A ppr i s e d to Revi s e d Faculty in the Disciplines Change What They Never Knew They Knew) https://wec.umn.edu/sites/wec.umn.edu/files/flash_chapter2016.pdf The next step is the application of the plan into the undergraduate curriculum and assessing Undergraduate Writing Plans. Integrating the WEC model is anticipated to show improvements in writing instruction at a rate that would meet faculty expectations. Each of three writing plans is tested for 1-3 academic years through multiple outlets; internal curricular study and structural changes, material development, writing workshops, seminars, and panels, and additional research. The feasibility of each edition of these writing plans is assessed by a subcommittee of the Faculty Senate; the Campus Writing Board. Contributions to writing plan assessment include triennial panel ratings of student writing against faculty expectations and criteria. The results are then used to guide future writing plans. Pamela Flash, a key figure in developing the WEC program, stresses the necessity of having the willingness to reflect on the current curriculum and the importance of diverting resistance between faculty members being integral to the Writing- Enriched Curriculum (WEC). This means that WEC essentially challenges the normal standards of writing and the way it is frequently taught. Flash argues that professors need to understand the principles of writing and writing education and to help them understand that undergraduate students and graduate students are not trained in the same writing strategies. When the professor possesses a knowledge of these conceptions the student is more likely to latch onto writing for their respective field of study. For the program itself there are undergraduate writing plans that are designed to graduate and equip students with a writing enriched degree. These plans are formulated by faculty meetings, statistics, curricular maps, and sample writings. The WEC model is based upon reflection and critically analyzing what would enrich the student‚Äôs writing curricula. = The principles of WAC and the WEC model = Because WEC closely reflects WAC, the principles that Barbara Walvoord gives to devise a WAC program are similar to Anson's Campus Writing and Speaking Program at NC State and Pamela Flash's WEC model at the University of Minnesota. James K. Elmborg's work on information literacy and WAC summarizes Walvoord's characteristics of creating a WAC program as: * Including colleagues from various disciplines, including teaching assistants and students, as they will all be affected by the WAC program the most. * Discussing what needs and concerns need to be met with a WAC program and who will be willing to dedicate time to implementing the curriculum. * What changes will be made to address this whether it be in school-wide assessments, writing centers or classroom methods * School administrators will then oversee and facilitate WAC but should not be seen as dictators. Similarly, both Anson's approach at NC State and Pamela Flash's model at the University of Minnesota reflect the same idea of coming together with faculty members from various fields throughout the curriculum and implementing these changes cohesively. The main point of difference between WAC and WEC, however, is that WEC requires faculty to maintain intentional support activity and assessment of how the program is affecting their students and to make changes, if necessary. By comparison, WAC does not require routinely assessment as part of its model. Like WAC, Flash's WEC model also requires ongoing implementation and incremental direct and indirect assessment, which allows the faculty-implemented plans to sustain. Anson's program at NC State revisits departments to conduct \\"profiles\\" of their efforts, resulting in a formative report for the department's use Anson, Chris M., & Dannels, D. P. (2009). Profiling Programs: Formative Uses of Assisted Descriptions in the Assessment of Communication Across the Curriculum. Across the Disciplines, 6 Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/docs/atd/assessment/anson_dannels.pdf According to Flash, WEC differs from most WAC programming in its departmental locus and its direct focus on the ways that faculty members in diverse disciplines conceptualize writing and writing instruction. Flash, P. (2016) Flash, P. (2016). From apprised to revised: Faculty in the disciplines change what they never knew they knew. In Yancey, K.B. (Ed.) A Rhetoric of Reflection (pp. 227-249). Logan, UT: Utah State University Press. = Evolution of the Writing-Enriched Curriculum = The process in the development of the Writing- Enriched Curriculum provides a space for equal dialogue between all faculty in all disciplines. WEC is no longer solely dedicated to composition studies and other writing courses, but has expanded toward the Performing Arts curriculum achieving interdepartmental dialogue between all faculty. In turn, WEC now focuses on creating, discovering, and using a language that can be translated into practical, academic, creative and professional fields.  Criticisms  P.A. Ramsay, in his paper Writing across the curriculum: Integrating discourse communities in the academy, found that students that participate in WAC programs become better communicators in their chosen discipline and demonstrated improved critical/analytical thinking.Ramsay, P.A. (2008). Writing across the curriculum: Integrating discourse communities in the academy. Kingston, Jamaica: School of Education, University of West Indies. Disadvantages of WAC include fears that the teaching style will reduce the available time to teach content material, difficulties getting teachers \\"on board\\" with the style, as well as fears that the teacher is ill-equipped to teach writing. Ramsay also found while working in Jamaica, that students who were unable to compose in their first language (either because of academic deficiencies or because the language did not have a written language) had difficulties composing in their second language using WAC practices. This was a sentiment echoed by Alexander Friedlander, who in his research found that students unable to write in their first language will have great difficulty writing in their second language regardless of whether their instruction has used WAC strategies.Friedlander, A. (1990). Composing in English: Effects of a first language on writing in English as a second language. In B.Kroll(Ed.), Second language writing: Research insights for the classroom (pp. 109-125).

It normally includes at least the following: # Storing and editing member information in a database. # Creating, renewing, upgrading and downgrading memberships. # Communicating with members by email, social media, telephone or post. Membership organizations have diverse needs and structures, and this is reflected in the additional features membership software sometimes includes: # Organizing and selling tickets to events or series' of events. # Publishing and delivering textual or audio-visual content. # Providing advertising opportunities via listings or targeted placements. # Facilitating interaction and collaborative file sharing between members. # Tracking members' interests and activity to provide relevant services. # Raising supplementary income from donations. Like many other modern software, membership software was initially delivered as desktop software, evolved into website-based software delivered from a web server, and is now increasingly delivered as a software as a service. In the initial (desktop software) and intermediate (website based software) stages of its development, Membership software was often combined with a separate public-facing website, which members would use to interact with the association (subscribing, booking events, purchasing content and advertising, posting discussions, uploading files). This necessitated complex integrations between proprietary membership software databases and content management systems. Today, membership software often integrates the core features of a content management system, to provide a single coherent interface for members and administrators. These are available as standalone or as plugins to popular open source content management systems. The smallest associations and clubs often create their own ecosystem of services to offer some of the same functionality as membership software. They do this by using generic database or spreadsheet software, and adding on external options as they need them (e.g. event registration, online payments, or email newsletters). The membership software market spans the rest of the industry, from small and medium-sized organizations with limited resources, to very large and complex multi-chapter organizations of national and international renown, to association management organizations which manage multiple associations using a single product. There are many products available from a wide variety of different commercial providers and open source projects. Most are generic, but many are also targeted at very particular segments (e.g., church software). Multi-chapter membership software tailors to organizations that are made up of chapters, clubs, regions, or segments that are part of the larger association. This particular type of membership software allows the apex or parent level of the organization to have more control over how each of their chapters are managed. Included in this might be a shared database, templated websites, shared event calendar and more. Membership software covers a massive range of uses, but in many instances it requires different membership levels, or access control levels. Depending on the software, it can even allow you to specify time limited access which is useful for time sensitive content. The access levels can be structured in a pyramidal form, where each access levels has access to the previous levels, or it can be vertical, where each access level has a standalone section they can access.

On September 28, 1850, the United States Congress authorized an appropriation of $15,000 for \\"a lighthouse and beacon light\\" at Brazos Santiago Pass. Work began in February 1852. When complete, the lighthouse was an 82-foot-high brick tower and had four lights. By 1854, it had 15 lamps and 21 reflectors. A third order fresnel lens was installed in 1857 \\"Inventory of Historic Light StationsTexas Lighthouses\\". National Park Service and the fixed light was varied by flashes. During the American Civil War the Point (Port) Isabel Lighthouse was occupied by soldiers from both sides as a look-out post. After the Civil War, the lighthouse was refitted and returned to operation in 1866. In 1888, the light was temporarily discontinued as claimants proved that the United States government did not have title to the land, forcing the government to condemn the land in 1894 to acquire title. On July 15, 1895, the light returned to use. It operated for ten years, after which time it was extinguished in 1905. On Sept. 20, 1927, the government sold the lighthouse and land. A local citizen purchased it. In the late 1940s, a movement began to save the lighthouse as a historic site. On October 5, 1950, the Texas State Park Board accepted the lighthouse and surrounding land as a gift from Mr. and Mrs. Lon C. Hill, Jr., the owners at the time. The Texas State Park Board began restoring the lighthouse in 1951, and it was opened to the public in 1952. Today the lighthouse is operated as Port Isabel Lighthouse State Historic Site. In September 1996, a new visitors center was completed. The site is owned by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department but operated by the City of Port Isabel.

An Albeluvisol is a soil with a thin, dark surface horizon on a bleached subsurface horizon (an albic horizon) that tongues into a clay illuviation (Bt) horizon. The Bt horizon has an irregular or broken upper boundary resulting from the tonguing of bleached soil material into the illuviation horizon. Albeluvisols correlate with Glossaqualfs, Glossocryalfs and Glossudalfs in the USDA soil taxonomy. These soils are formed mostly in unconsolidated glacial till, lacustrine or fluvial materials or aeolian deposits such as loess. They occur on flat to undulating plains under coniferous forest or mixed forest in boreal and temperate climates with cold winters and short cool summers. The agricultural suitability of Albeluvisols is limited because of their acidity, low nutrient levels, tillage and drainage problems. In northern regions there is also a short growing season and severe frost during the long winter. The Albeluvisols of the northern taiga zone are almost exclusively under forest with small areas used for pasture or hay fields. In the southern taiga zone, less than 10 percent of the non-forested area is used for livestock farming. In the southern and western parts of the taiga in Russia arable crops, such as cereals, potatoes, sugar beet and forage maize, are found, especially on soils with higher base saturations in the subsoil. Albeluvisols cover an estimated 320 million ha in Europe, North Asia, Central Asia and in North America. They are concentrated in two regions: *the continental regions that had permafrost in the Pleistocene of northeast Europe, northwest Asia and southern Canada, which constitute by far the largest areas of Albeluvisols; *the loess and cover sand areas and old alluvial areas in moist temperate regions, such as France, central Belgium, the southeast of the Netherlands and the north and north-east of Germany.

With the slowly increasing visibility of LGBT characters on fiction series, a pattern began to emerge, beginning with repressed lesbian sniper Miss Brant from 1961's The Asphalt Jungle and continuing through a murderous female impersonator from The Streets of San Francisco and Police Woman and her trio of killer lesbians in 1974 and beyond, of presenting LGBT characters as psychotic killers on crime dramas. On medical dramas, the disease model of homosexuality was fostered in characters like 1963's Hallie Lambert from The Eleventh Hour and Martin Loring from Marcus Welby, M.D. in 1973. Gays, the viewing public was told over and over, were simultaneously dangerous and sick, to be feared and to be pitied. In response to complaints about several early portrayals, networks began vetting scripts with gay characters or content through two recently formed advocacy groups, the National Gay Task Force and the Gay Media Task Force. Several episodes saw substantive changes based on these consultations, but in other instances, notably the Marcus Welby, M.D. episode \\"The Other Martin Loring\\", only minor changes were made and groups like the Gay Activists Alliance led zaps, raucous demonstrations, against the networks. Protests against the 1974 Marcus Welby episode \\"The Outrage\\", with its male child molestation plot, and the aforementioned killer lesbian trio from the Police Woman episode \\"Flowers of Evil\\" led producers to start moving away from the killer queer plot device. Gays and lesbians would continue to be portrayed as killers but their motives would less frequently be related to their sexuality. Gays started killing out of greed and jealousy, just like heterosexuals.Tropiano, pp. 71‚Äì2 Other dramas not legal or medical in nature also ran occasional episodes featuring LGBT characters. Sitcoms too began presenting LGBT characters, with All in the Family producing several episodes on the theme beginning in 1971. Gay sitcom episodes tended to follow one of a handful of plot devices: a character close to a lead character would unexpectedly come out, forcing the characters to confront their own issues with homosexuality; a lead character is mistaken for gay; a lead character pretends to be gay; or, more rarely, a recurring character from the series comes out. In the first instance, it was rare that the gay character would ever make another appearance.Tropiano, p. 191, 212, 224 Dating back to Robert Reed's turn as a transgender doctor on Medical Center in 1975, transgender characters and issues have tended to receive sympathetic treatment.Tropiano, p. 27 This list covers American television episodes with LGBT themes that aired from 1970 through 1979.

It connects Piazza del Popolo to Piazza di Spagna and is part of the complex of streets known as Tridente. History The origins of Via del Babuino dates back to 13th century. The first two names of the street were Via dell‚ÄôOrto di Napoli and Via del Cavalletto. In 1525, works commissioned by Pope Clement VII gave the street a new aspect and a new name: Via Clementina, in honor of its creator. It later became Via Paolina, because of the works carried out under Pope Paul III in 1540. In 1571, on the initiative of Pope Pius V, a new fountain for public use was installed along the street. In this occasion a statue of Silenus, an ancient classical deity related to springs and fountains, was also placed on the street. The statue quickly became infamous among the inhabitants of the rione because of its ugliness. The statues was compared to a monkey, and was thus nicknamed Babuino (Romanesco for \\"Baboon\\"); this name soon came to indicate the whole street.

It is administered by Business Law Policy Unit of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE). In June 2017, a review of the existing legislation was announced. New Zealand is party to several international copyright agreements, including the TRIPS Agreement 1994, the Berne Convention 1928 and the Universal Copyright Convention 1952.  Scope of copyright  The Copyright Act 1994 provides owners of original work with a monopoly to control the use and dissemination of their work. The owner of the copyright in a work has the exclusive right to exploit the economic rights. A person infringes copyright in a work when he or she, other than pursuant to a copyright licence, does any of the following ‚Äúrestricted acts‚Äù, either in relation to the work as a whole or any ‚Äúsubstantial part‚Äù of it: * copying the work * publishing, issuing or selling copies to the public * performing, playing or showing the work in public * broadcasting the work * making any work derived or adapted from the copyright work Anyone who wants to use someone else‚Äôs work requires the permission of the right owner. The copyright owner can assign, transfer, and license the economic rights in the work.  Copyright works  Copyright automatically applies (no registration required) to original works in the following categories: * Literary works (novels, poems, song lyrics, computer programming/programmes, compilations of data) * Dramatic works (scripts for films or plays) * Artistic works (paintings, plans, maps, photographs, sculptures, models, buildings) * Musical works (scores and arrangements) * Sound recordings (of musical, literary or dramatic works) * Films * Broadcasts (radio, TV, cable) * Typographical arrangement of published editions (this exists independent of copyright in the published work, if any) Copyright does not apply to certain government works, such as Acts of Parliament, Regulations, Parliamentary debates, Court judgments and reports of Select Committees, Royal Commissions, Commissions of Inquiry, etc.  Copyright term  Copyright protection does not last forever. The duration of copyright protection depends on the type of work. The work will eventually be out of copyright (there is no concept of public domain in New Zealand legislation). This means that once copyright has expired, everyone can freely use the work. Before such time permission of the rights holder is required to use a copyrighted work. New Zealand's copyright term is largely consistent with other countries, and complies with the WIPO standard. The copyright term depends on the type of work in question. Here are some examples: * Literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works: 50 years from the death of the author * Sound recordings and films: 50 years from when it is available to the public * Broadcasts and cable: 50 years from broadcast * Typographical arrangements: 25 years from first publishing * Computer-generated work: 50 years after being made * Crown copyright: 100 years * Artistic works industrially applied: 16 years from when the work is applied * Artistic craftsmanship industrially applied: 25 years from when the work is applied  Exclusions and fair dealing  The Copyright Act allows for certain permitted acts to be exempted from copyright restrictions. These include: * fair dealing for the purpose of criticism, review, news reporting, research or private study * certain educational purposes * time shifting of TV programmes for viewing at a later time * format shifting of music * back up of computer programs * braille copies of literary or dramatic works  Moral rights  Besides protecting the economic rights of the author, copyright law also protects the moral rights of an author. Moral rights protect the author from distortion, mutilation or other modification of the work where that act would be or is prejudicial to the reputation of the author. Moral rights are inalienably attached to the author and cannot be transferred. Some moral rights can, however, be waived. Moral rights give the author for instance the right to: * be identified as the author (right of attribution) * object to derogatory treatment of the work (right of integrity) * not have work falsely attributed to them  New technologies amendments  In 2001, the Ministry of Economic Development initiated a major review of copyright law, in light of new technologies, such as media in digital form and communications via the internet. Law changes were enacted in 2008, most notably the Copyright (New Technologies) Amendment Act. These changes were influenced by media corporations and aligned organisations (RIANZ, APRA, Artists Alliance, NZSA, AIPA, NZIPP, etc.), but opposed by New Zealand artists, technology specialists, ISPs, businesses, media commentators, librarians and members of the public. The nature of the law changes attracted attention internationally. Prime Minister John Key stated that the stronger copyright laws, including the controversial section 92a, were required for New Zealand to be able to negotiate a free trade agreement with the United States. In February 2010, a Bill repealing section 92a of the Act was introduced to parliament, replacing it with a three notice regime for copyright infringement via file sharing. The bill also provides for the Copyright Tribunal to hear complaints and award penalties of up to $15,000. The notice regime took effect on 1 September 2011. In 2013, the Copyright Tribunal decided 17 cases pertaining to illegal file sharing. In all 17 cases, the applicant was the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) taking action on behalf of the copyright holders against individual Internet account holders. None of the account holders were infringing on a commercial scale for profit. In most cases the infringement concerned the uploading of music using BitTorrent file- sharing protocols.

Background In 1978, the United Nations Security Council agreed to the basic principle of a UN-assisted Namibian independence process. But disputes remained over which group would determine Namibia's independence. Internationally, the division over Namibia was between, on the one hand, South Africa, Namibia's 'internal parties', the Western Contact Group (WCG), and on the other, SWAPO, the United Nations General Assembly, the Non-Aligned States in the Security Council, and the Frontline States (Tanzania, Zambia, Angola, Mozambique, Botswana, Zimbabwe - since its independence in 1980 - and Nigeria). The UN Secretariat's UNTAG mission was supposed to be impartial even though both South Africa and SWAPO accused UNTAG of favouring the other side. (The General Assembly supported SWAPO financially for many years, including the construction of the United Nations Institute for Namibia in Zambia, which was set up to train Namibian exiles and refugees. Basic framework The Western Contact Group brought South Africa to the negotiating table and drafted three 1978 documents which created the basic framework of UNTAG's peace implementation mandate: # WCG's Settlement Proposal S/12636 of 10 April 1978; # UN Secretary-General's report of 29 August 1978 (S/12827); # United Nations Security Council Resolution 435 (S/RES/435). The Settlement Proposal called for free and fair elections to pave the way for a transition to Namibian independence. The proposal included the mandate for the Secretary-General to appoint a Special Representative, who 'will have to satisfy himself at each stage as to the fairness and appropriateness of all measures affecting the political process at all levels of administration before such measures take effect. Moreover, the Special Representative may himself make proposals in regard to any aspect of the political process.' This resolution placed the Special Representative at the heart of all decision making. Finnish diplomat, Martti Ahtisaari, was chosen for the position in 1978, after his appointment as UN Commissioner for Namibia in 1977. The Settlement Proposal included a very specific timetable for the implementation of the elections with certain tasks which the UN, South African government and SWAPO had to fulfil. The elections would create an independent Namibian 'Constituent Assembly' which would draw up a constitution immediately upon its election and then govern in a 'National Assembly'. A number of uncertainties were resolved in the UNS-G's report (S/12827) including uniting the civilian and military components of UNTAG under one Special Representative. But many issues were unresolved. Ten years later The unresolved issues, while potentially hindering the operation, actually helped the Special Representative to define the mission based on the realities of 1988 - when the operation began - rather than 1978, when the accord was initially drafted. UN Commissioner for Namibia, Bernt Carlsson, should have become the Special Representative upon signature of the New York Accords on 22 December 1988 but was killed in the Lockerbie bombing of 21 December 1988. Former UN Commissioner Martti Ahtisaari, who helped draw up the original Settlement Proposal, was therefore recalled from an administrative position at UN Headquarters to serve as Special Representative so as 'to ensure the early independence of Namibia through free and fair elections under the supervision and control of the United Nations'. Independence Free elections in Namibia were held in November 1989 with SWAPO taking 57% of the vote in spite of Pretoria‚Äôs attempts to swing it in favour of other parties.The Guardian, 26 July 1991 By 9 February 1990, the Constituent Assembly had drafted and adopted a constitution. Independence Day on 21 March 1990 was attended by numerous international representatives, including the main players, the UN Secretary- General Javier P√©rez de Cu√©llar and President of South Africa F. W. de Klerk, who jointly conferred formal independence on Namibia. Sam Nujoma was sworn in as the first President of Namibia watched by Nelson Mandela (who had been released from prison shortly beforehand) and representatives from 147 countries, including 20 heads of state.Chronology of Namibian Independence References History of Namibia Treaties of Namibia Treaties of South Africa Namibia‚ÄìSouth Africa relations ","title":"Settlement Proposal"},{"id":"21138747","text":"No Turning Back may refer to: Politics * No Turning Back (political group), a group within the British Conservative Party Music * No Turning Back (Burning Starr album), 1986 * No Turning Back (Out of Eden album), 1999 * No Turning Back (Imelda May album), 2003 * No Turning Back (Brandon Heath album), 2015 * No Turning Back, a 1979 album by Kevin Borich Express * No Turning Back, a 1989 album by Ian Stuart Donaldson * No Turning Back, a 1990 album by Jimi Hocking's band Jimi the Human & Spectre 7 * No Turning Back, a 1998 album by Jersey (band) * No Turning Back, a 2003 album by Hilton Schilder * No Turning Back, a 2005 album by Calyx (musician) * No Turning Back: 1985‚Äì2005, a DVD collection by Glass Tiger * \\"No Turning Back\\", a 1986 single by Blyss feat.

Typically heard without formal introduction, StarDate is a self-contained science news feature interwoven with routine radio programming. It is the longest-running science outreach program on U.S. radio. Created in 1978 by science journalist Deborah Byrd of the McDonald Observatory, the short (2-minute) format of StarDate sprang Byrd's scripts written for a telephone hot line on astronomy, which had started a year earlier. The telephone scripts had attracted the notice of a producer at radio station KLBJ-FM in Austin, who had turned them into a radio show that was broadcast for a year under the name \\"Have You Seen the Stars Tonight?\\" ‚Äî a reference to the song co-written by Paul Kantner of Jefferson Starship. With the support of Harlan James Smith, McDonald Observatory's director, and after securing funding from the National Science Foundation, Byrd changed the name to Star Date (invoking the term \\"stardate\\" used in the opening monologue of the 1960s television series Star Trek) and began the series' national distribution in 1979. The niche broadcasting position of StarDate has always been its quick but relaxed, diary-like delivery which allows it to be interspersed with regular programming. Byrd produced the show, and Joel Block hosted it, until 1991, when a change in management at McDonald led both to depart and start another syndicated radio series, Earth & Sky, which aired from 1991 to 2013 and was heard on about 1,000 radio stations.

The series originated from New York City, and was sponsored by Welch's Family Wine. Gameplay In this quiz show the contestants, which consisted of pairs, had the chance to win a trip to any part of the United States. The more questions they won, the further they would get to travel on bus. For example, in one episode a contestant and her partner/friend stated that they would like to travel to Austin, Texas, so that they could improve their education. Occasionally, the full prize would be given to the contestants even if they didn't win, if it was decided that they had a sad enough story. At the end of each episode, the winning couples would get a chance to fly to their destination on an airplane, then a luxury to most people. =Format change= After the series moved to ABC, the network only used the game show format on January 23 and 30; on February 6, the program was changed to a talent contest. Episode status One of the last three DuMont episodes is known to exist from January 1954, with special guest Jackie Cooper; although the gameplay is intact, all copies found have no last segment.

In 2009, Nadel was indicted on fifteen federal counts of securities fraud, wire fraud and mail fraud. If found guilty, he could have been sentenced to 280 years in prison and would have been required to forfeit all assets connected to the fraud. Nadel was a Sarasota, Florida- based manager of the hedge fund Scoop Management Co., which has reportedly lost $350 million. He was arrested on January 27, 2009 after surrendering at the Tampa Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) office. Nadel, who had been reported missing by his fifth wife since January 14, was accompanied by two attorneys, Todd Foster and Barry Cohen. His wife, Marguerite \\"Peg\\" J. (Quisenberry) Nadel had contacted authorities after he left a note telling her how to survive financially without him. \\"The avenues to money for you will likely be blocked soon,\\" Nadel wrote to his wife in a note that employees found January 15 in a shredding machine. \\"Withdraw as much cash as you can,\\" he said, adding that he would send further instructions. \\"Sell the Subaru if you need money.\\" He left a package for his wife. \\"Look at all the recently paid bills in the 'package' to see where they stand,\\" he wrote. \\"Also in the package are enough documents that I think will do the trick to give you complete control and ownership of what is left, and even documentation for divorce.\\" She said he was distraught over the losses, according to Bloomberg News. According to the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office, Nadel felt guilty and threatened to kill himself. As of January 20, 2009, Federal law enforcement authorities had tracked Nadel to Slidell, Louisiana. The Nadel case has been compared to the recent alleged frauds of Bernie Madoff and Marcus Schrenker. On April 18, 2012, Arthur Nadel died at Butner Federal Correctional Complex in North Carolina. He was 79. Personal life and previous occupations Nadel worked his way through New York University, and in 1957, graduated from New York University Law School, playing piano in Manhattan. He never actively practiced law, but was disbarred in 1982, citing \\"dishonesty, fraud, deceit and misrepresentation\\". He moved to Sarasota in around 1978, and he allegedly took $50,000 from an escrow account to help a friend and real estate company president who was deeply in debt. Different versions of who received the money have been reported. He had already repaid the money with interest by 1981. He had already been married and divorced twice and had several children. He was a CEO in the 1970s of a public company that built health care facilities. In 1978, he and others tried to convert the rundown, historic Mira Mar Hotel into condominiums. The plan fell apart. He subsequently played in piano bars, befriending local artists and musicians. In 1987, he married his third wife, Virginia \\"Jennifer\\" Hoffman, an artist 22 years his junior. Her friends began complaining that he had sold their works but never paid them. They divorced in 1991. He attempted to expand an interior decorating businessthe Sarasota Design Gallery, which sold unusual furnishings and original artby attracting investors, claiming in a \\"confidential\\" prospectus that the gallery was profitable, although court records showed several judgments against him for unpaid bills. He claimed destitution. He became a real estate developer and securities investor in Sarasota during the 1960s, according to marketing documents for the Valhalla fund. From 1994 through 1997, Nadel was employed as a piano player at Homestyle Harmony restaurant, a family-style dining establishment in Sarasota where waitstaff sang \\"sing-a-long\\" songs to customers during dinner, as well as performing for guests in a \\"parlor\\" show down the hall in the restaurant. The restaurant closed in 1997. In 1997, he and Peg started a day-trading club and developed a computer-based investment and trading system. They teamed up with Neil V. Moody, a Sarasota entrepreneur, and began managing money for clients in Moody's Valhalla, Victor, and Viking funds. The companies attracted scores of investors, promising high returns. In 2005, the Nadels bought near Asheville, North Carolina, intending to sell lots for up to $525,000 in a proposed development called Laurel Mountain Preserve. The project turned when prices collapsed. Four lots were donated to their foundation as tax write off. The Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported \\"The Nadels were known for their civic activities, serving on boards and donating money to charity: Habitat for Humanity, Jewish Family & Children's Services, and Girls Inc. which received $100,000. All received cash gifts and pledges from the couple in recent years. None had any money invested in the hedge funds.\\" Their Guy-Nadel Foundation made more than $1-million in donations, including $200,000 to Catholic churches, $100,000 to the Sarasota Opera and $75,000 to a local theater group. SEC charges and criminal charges Tampa U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark Pizzo denied Nadel's request to be released on his own recognizance, and on January 30, 2009 ordered him held without bail at the Pinellas County jail. On February 2, 2009, Judge Pizzo issued a warrant of removal, removing the case from the jurisdiction of the Middle District of Florida to the Southern District of New York. The SEC says Nadel had transferred at least $1.25 million from two of the hedge funds to secret bank accounts that he controlled.\\"SEC Charges Missing Money Manager With Fraud\\", Associated Press via Yahoo News (January 21, 2009) =16-Count indictment= On April 15, 2009, U.S. Magistrate Judge Kevin N. Fox in Manhattan appointed Mark Gombiner, an attorney from the Federal Defenders of New York, Inc., to represent Nadel. On April 28, 2009, in the Southern District of New York, federal regulators handed down a 15-count indictment against Nadel, which carries maximum prison sentences of 280 years. > \\"Nadel solicited prospective clients to invest in the funds by making > various misrepresentations about the performance and value of the funds, > including that the net asset value of each of the funds was tens of millions > of dollars. the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York said in a statement. > Nadel also claimed to investors that his purchases and sales of securities > in the Funds had generated cumulatively more than $271 million in gains. In > truth, Nadel's trading resulted in an overall net loss in the funds,\\" the > U.S. Attorney's Office in New York said in a statement. On February 25, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote had ruled he could be released after posting a $5 million bond, including $1 million in cash, and four people to whom he has a \\"close relationship\\" to guarantee his bond and be subject to electronic monitoring. She required Nadel to cooperate with the receiver of his funds and to identify the location of$30 million he allegedly withdrew since October, 2008. The criminal case is U.S.A. v. Nadel, 09-mJ-00169, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). =Bankruptcy trustee= The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) won a court order on January 21, 2009 freezing Nadel's assets. On February 11, 2009, the receiver, Burton Wiand moved to freeze the $650,000 Marguerite J. Nadel Revocable Trust, and Nadel's property in Asheville, North Carolina. Six hedge funds and two investment management companies are named as relief defendants. They are: Scoop Real Estate L.P., Valhalla Investment Partners L.P., Victory IRA Fund Ltd., Victory Fund Ltd., Viking IRA Fund LLC, Viking Fund LLC, Valhalla Management Inc. and Viking Management Inc. in the case. The SEC case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Nadel, 09-cv-00087, U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida (Tampa). At the end of 2007, all six funds contained $18 million. Wiand identified $397 million taken in from investors. Approximately $350 million was paid in distributions to investors and fees. He has recovered $120,000 in investor funds improperly transferred to two individuals, and received nearly $261,000 in business income from ongoing operations through Feb. 28, 2009. Wiand estimated the fraud began possibly earlier than 2003, and intends to recover additional funds from the Moodys' fees collected from Scoop. Clawbacks Wiand has identified more than 80 investors who made \\"false profits\\" in Nadel's hedge fund and as a clawback has asked them to return the money. Any unreturned funds will be pursued in court. Robert O. Chambers Trust, received $301,614 in false profits. Blake L. Chambers, trustee of the trust, agreed within 14 days to pay $271,453, or 90 percent of the total. Gary Musser 70, of Las Vegas agreed to pay $192,571.43, which includes a 10 percent discount offered for settling out of court. He has already paid income taxes on the money, yet the Internal Revenue Service only allows him to go back three years in amending his returns to get a refund. =Others involved= The Moodys have already given statements to the U.S. Attorney. Neil and Chris Moody, father and son partners of Nadel's served as general partners on Viking, Viking IRA and Valhalla, which at one point accounted for half of the actual brokerage firm value, estimated to be $97 million in asset management fees of 2 percent per year, plus a much larger 25 percent incentive fee for running what was portrayed as highly profitable hedge funds. The funds held $72 million at their peak in 2004. By 2007, the actual value of those same three funds was $7 million. Burton Wiand has confirmed he will take legal action against the Moodys to gain control of assets tied to Nadel's failed hedge funds. It was Neil Moody who informed his 600 investors that the money they invested in Scoop's hedge funds had disappeared. The Moodys have denied knowing anything about the Ponzi scheme, but many of Nadel's investors claim that they were their primary contact. According to Wiand, Nadel and the Moodys both represented that the hedge funds' trading activity generated more than $272 million in gains when\\" they actually lost $18.4 million. The three Viking funds the Moody's managed with Nadel had results ranging from a 4 percent annualized gain to a 24.5 percent per year loss. But the Moody's told their investors that returns for the funds were much higher. A civil fraud case against them has been filed on behalf of Louis Paolino, Jr. who lost more than $5.8 million, and a lis pendens has been placed on the Sarasota waterfront residences owned by both men. Nadel's accountant, Michael D. Zucker, had not been licensed as a Certified Public Accountant in the state of Florida since 1990.\\"Accountant of Nadel Funds Had No License\\", Sarasota Herald-Tribune via Tampa Bay Online (January 24, 2009) David S Band Law firm \\"Band Weintraub PL\\" will pay nearly $1 million to settle claims that it was front and center in a conspiracy to hide money from the receiver in the Arthur Nadel Ponzi scheme. \\"The most consistent returns I have ever seen\\" Nadel's funds purportedly returned 21.6% in 2002 and 19.8% in 2001, years when the S&P; 500 returned -23.3% and -13.0% respectively. An article in The Wall Street Digest by Donald H. Rowe, Chairman of Carnegie Asset Management, cited the superior returns of Nadel's funds as \\"the best track record and most consistent returns I have ever seen.\\" Rowe apparently ignored initial misgivings about the source of Nadel's returns, writing: \\"My curiosity about Nadel's computerized trading program eventually led to a due diligence visit to the offices of Nadel & Moody. Understandably, I did not learn the various mathematical formulas in Nadel's \\"black box\\" computer program.\\" Despite the statistical improbability of the stated returns, Rowe's article offers a glowing recommendation and includes contact information for the funds. Fine print disclosures in the article reveal that \\"Carnegie Asset Management is affiliated with The Wall Street Digest, Inc., as is The Wall Street Trader, Inc. Carnegie Asset Management, from time to time, makes referrals to MRM Asset Allocation Group, Inc.,and/or The Nadel Moody Group, registered investment advisors not affiliated with each other nor with Carnegie Asset Management, for which Carnegie Asset Management receives monetary compensation.\\" Burton Wiand's April, 2009 interim receiver's report, submitted as part of the Securities and Exchange Commission's civil suit against Nadel, says Nadel paid out some $53 million in \\"fictitious profits\\" as part of his Ponzi scheme. Total value of hedge funds Nadel traded for three funds established by partnerships Valhalla Management and Viking Management and three funds established by Scoop Management and Scoop Capital LLC. Scoop was created by Nadel himself. Viking and Valhalla were created by unnamed partners. According to the SEC: *Victory Fund: securities, $1,901.31, and cash, $78,764.37 *Scoop Real Estate: securities, $2,119.81, and cash, $122,830.40 *Viking IRA Fund: securities, $2,923.58, and cash, $77,025.20 *Viking Fund: securities, $917.70, and cash, $65,708.33 *Valhalla Investment Partners: securities, $4,413.66, and cash, $16,158.05 *Victory IRA Fund: securities, $2,938.86, and cash, $131,139.52 The total value of the hedge fund securities on January 14 ‚Äî the date of Nadel's disappearance ‚Äî was thus $15,214.92, and the cash on hand was $491,625.87. Investor losses More than 371 investors invested $397 million. Investors' out-of-pocket losses are estimated at $168.7 million. Neil V. Moody, 70 told the Associated Press that his immediate family has lost $12 million due to Nadel. Moody, one of Nadel's business partners, suggests the $350 million figure may be inflated due to Nadel's own overstating of his fund's success. Dennis Raefield, president and chief executive of Mace Security International Inc., based in Horsham, Pennsylvania, claims that Nadel's Victory Fund failed to pay $2.2 million as promised, the day after Nadel vanished on January 15, 2009. Raefield said he asked Nadel in June 2008 to redeem Mace's entire $3.2 million investment in the short-term hedge fund, Victory. The money was to be paid by October 10, 2008, or 10 business days after the close of the third quarter. On October 15, fund managers asserted their right to withhold the payout \\"due to extraordinary market circumstances\\". After negotiations, the fund agreed to pay the money in two installments. Mace received only one payment of $1 million on November 5. Louis Paolino, Jr., former executive officer of Mace Security lost more than $5.8 million of personal funds in the Viking Fund LLC. His lawsuit claims that the Moodys took fraudulently obtained money from investors in Scoop's funds and bought homes with part of the proceeds. David Walters of Ocala, Florida lost most of his pension from Bethlehem Steel, more than $670,000. Michael Sullivan, a neighbor of Nadel's, an 80-year-old attorney, invested $15 million. Sullivan, an Illinois entrepreneur recommended by his neighbor, put $250,000 into Nadel's Scoop Management three years ago, and an additional $1.4 million shortly before Nadel vanished. Dr. Brad Lerner, Sarasota, invested $500,000. Drew Sneed, Sarasota Other business interests On January 27, 2009, Venice Jet Center LLC and Tradewind LLC, two of Nadel's businesses, were ordered into receivership by Tampa U.S. District Judge Richard Lazzara. The judge appointed attorney Burton Wiand as receiver for Nadel's funds, said in a court filing that the businesses were bought with fraudulently obtained money. Venice Jet Center provides charter services and a flight school, and \\"is a viable business with potential to generate assets for the receivership\\". Tradewind owns and controls at least five aircraft and owns airport hangars at the Newnan-Coweta County Airport in suburban Atlanta, Georgia. The Venice Jet Center trained some of the 9/11 hijackers under different ownership. Tradewind Aviation was run by his son Chris, who has an airline pilot's license. Federal records show Tradewind owns two Cessna Citation jets, a Lear Jet, a helicopter, and several smaller aircraft. Public records show Nadel was an officer of Summer Place Development Corp., a undeveloped parcel in Manatee County, Florida. He was listed as director, secretary, and treasurer.

History  Municipal governance in India has existed since the year 1687, with the formation of Madras Municipal Corporation, and then Calcutta and Bombay Municipal Corporation in 1726. In the early part of the nineteenth century almost all towns in India had experienced some form of municipal governance. In 1882 the then Viceroy of India, Lord Ripon, known as the Father of Local Self Government, passed a resolution of local self-government which laid the democratic forms of municipal governance in India. In 1919, a Government of India Act incorporated the need of the resolution and the powers of democratically elected government were formulated. In 1935 another Government of India act brought local government under the preview of the state or provincial government and specific powers were given.  74th Constitutional Amendment Act  It was the 74th amendment to the Constitution of India in 1992 that brought constitutional validity to municipal or local governments. Until amendments were made in respective state municipal legislations as well, municipal authorities were organised on an ultra vires (beyond the authority) basis and the state governments were free to extend or control the functional sphere through executive decisions without an amendment to the legislative provisions. As per the 2011 Census, the key urbanised areas were classified as follows # Statutory Towns: All administrative units that have been defined by statute as urban like Municipal Corporation, Municipality, Cantonment Board, Notified Town Area Committee, Town Panchayat, Nagar Palika etc., are known as Statutory Towns. According to the 2011 Census of India, there were 4041 statutory urban local bodies (ULBs) in the country as compared to 3799 as per Census of 2001. # Census Towns: All Administrative units satisfying the following three criteria simultaneously: i) A minimum population of 5,000 persons ; ii) 75 per cent and above of the male main working population being engaged in non‚Äìagricultural pursuits; and iii) A density of population of at least 400 persons per sq. km. As per 2011 Census, there were 3,784 Census Towns as against 1,362 in 2001. Statutory towns are of various kinds and the major categories include # Municipal corporation (Nagar Nigam) (‡§®‡§ó‡§∞ ‡§®‡§ø‡§ó‡§Æ) # Municipality (municipal council, municipal board, municipal committee) (Nagar Parishad)(‡§®‡§ó‡§∞ ‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§∑‡§¶‡•ç) # Town area committee # Notified area committee The municipal corporations and municipalities are fully representative bodies, while the notified area committees and town area committees are either fully or partially nominated bodies. As per the Constitution of India, 74th Amendment Act of 1992, the latter two categories of towns are to be designated as municipalities or nagar panchayats with elected bodies. After the 74th Amendment was enacted there are only three categories of urban local bodies: * Mahanagar Nigam (Municipal Corporation) (‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§®‡§ó‡§∞ ‡§®‡§ø‡§ó‡§Æ) * Nagar Palika (Municipality)(‡§®‡§ó‡§∞ ‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ) * Nagar Panchayat (Notified Area Council or City Council)(‡§®‡§ó‡§∞ ‡§™‡§Ç‡§ö‡§æ‡§Ø‡§§) Among all urban local governments, municipal corporations enjoy a greater degree of fiscal autonomy and functions, although the specific fiscal and functional powers vary across the states. These local governments have larger populations, a more diversified economic base, and deal with the state governments directly. On the other hand, municipalities or nagar panchayats have less autonomy, smaller jurisdictions and have to deal with the state governments through the Directorate of Municipalities or through the collector of a district. These local bodies are subject to detailed supervisory control and guidance by the state governments.  State Municipal Acts  State Municipal Acts are legislations enacted by state governments to establish municipal governments, administer them, and provide a framework of governance for cities within the state. Every state has its own municipal act and some states have more than one municipal act, governing larger and smaller municipalities under different acts. Various processes including rules for elections, recruitment of staff, and demarcation of urban areas derive from the state municipal acts. Most Municipal Acts are enforced across all statutory urban areas in the respective states except the cantonment areas. Government of India had issued a Model Municipal Law in 2003 which aimed to consolidate and amend the laws relating to the municipal governments in the various states and bring them into conformity with the provisions of the 74th CAA.  Responsibilities of urban local bodies  The municipal bodies of India are vested with a long list of functions delegated to them by the state governments under their respective municipal legislations. The Twelfth Schedule of Constitution (Article 243 w) provides an illustrative list of eighteen functions, that may be entrusted to the municipalities. Public health includes water supply, sewerage and sanitation, eradication of communicable diseases etc.; welfare includes public facilities such as education, recreation, etc.; regulatory functions related to prescribing and enforcing building regulations, encroachments on public land, birth registration and death certificate, etc.; public safety includes fire protection, street lighting, etc.; public works measures such as construction and maintenance of inner city roads, etc.; and development functions related to town planning and development of commercial markets. In addition to the legally assigned functions, the sectoral departments of the state government often assign unilaterally, and on an agency basis, various functions such as family planning, nutrition and slum improvement, disease and epidemic control, etc. Besides the traditional core functions of municipalities, it also includes development functions like planning for economic development and social justice, urban poverty alleviation programs and promotion of cultural, educational and aesthetic aspects. However, conformity legislation enacted by the state governments indicate wide variations in this regard. Whereas Bihar, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Manipur, Punjab and Rajasthan have included all the functions as enlisted in the Twelfth Schedule in their amended state municipal laws, Andhra Pradesh has not made any changes in the existing list of municipal functions. Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal states have amended their municipal laws to add additional functions in the list of municipal functions as suggested in the twelfth schedule. There is a lot of difference in the assignment of obligatory and discretionary functions to the municipal bodies among the states. Whereas functions like planning for the social and economic development, urban forestry and protection of the environment and promotion of ecological aspects are obligatory functions for the municipalities of Maharashtra, in Karnataka these are discretionary functions. Provision of water supply and sewerage in several states has either been taken over by the state governments or transferred to state agencies. For example, in Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, water supply and sewerage works are being carried out by the state level Public Health Engineering Department or Water Supply and Sewerage Boards, while liability for repayment of loans and maintenance are with the municipalities. Besides these state level agencies, City Improvement Trusts and Urban Development Authorities, like Delhi Development Authority (DDA), have been set up in a number of cities. These agencies usually undertake land acquisition and development works, and take up remunerative projects such as markets and commercial complexes, etc. In terms of fiscal federalism, functions whose benefits largely confine to municipal jurisdictions and may be termed as the essentially municipal functions. Similarly, functions that involve substantial economics of scale or are of national interest may not be assigned to small local bodies. For valid reasons, certain functions of higher authorities are appropriate to be entrusted with the Municipalities ‚Äì as if under principal- agent contracts and may be called agency functions that need to be financed by intergovernmental revenues. Thus instead of continuing the traditional distinction between obligatory and discretionary functions the municipal responsibilities may be grouped into essentially municipal, joint and agency functions. = Suggested municipal functions = The suggested functions to municipal corporations, municipalities and nagar panchayats are listed in the table below.Reforming Municipal Finances: Some suggestions in the context of India‚Äôs Decentralization Initiative, by Mohanty P.K., Urban India, January‚ÄìJune 1995. {width=\\"80%\\" border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"6\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" - Bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" align=\\"left\\" !Essentially Municipal Functions !!Municipal Corporation !!

Mahanagar Palika or by some other names in different states(translated in english as Municipal Corporation) in India are state government formed departments that works for the development of a metropolitan city, which has a population of more than 1 million. The growing population and urbanisation in various cities of India were in need of a local governing body that can work for providing necessary community services like health centres, educational institutes and housing and property tax. They also replace street lights. They are formed under the Corporations Act of 1835 of panchayati raj system which mainly deals in providing essential services in every small town as well as village of a district/city. Their elections are held once in five year and the people choose the candidates. The largest corporations are in the eight metropolitan cities of India, namely Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Surat, and Pune. These cities not only have a large population, but are also the administrative as well as commercial centres of the country.  Municipality (Nagar Palika)  In India, a Nagar Palika or Municipality is an urban local body that administers a city of minimum population of 100,000 but less than 1,000,000. However, there are exceptions to that, as previously nagar palikas were constituted in urban centers with population over 20,000 so all the urban bodies which were previously classified as Nagar palika were reclassified as Nagar palika even if their population was under 100,000. Under the Panchayati Raj system, it interacts directly with the state government, though it is administratively part of the district it is located in. Generally smaller district cities and bigger towns have a Nagar palika. Nagar palikas are also a form of local self- government, entrusted with some duties and responsibilities, as enshrined and guided upon by the Constitutional (74th Amendment)Act,1992. Udaipur is a city which is big but its population is 451,000 so it has a Nagar Palika. The members of the Nagar palika are elected representatives for a term of five years. The town is divided into wards according to its population, and representatives are elected from each ward. The members elect a president among themselves to preside over and conduct meetings. A chief officer, along with officers like an engineer, sanitary inspector, health officer and education officer who come from the state public service are appointed by the state government to control the administrative affairs of the Nagar Palika.  Notified Area Council (Nagar Panchayat)  A Nagar Panchayat or Notified Area Council or City Council is a form of an urban political unit in India comparable to a municipality. An urban centre with more than 11,000 and less than 25,000 inhabitants is classified as a \\"Nagar Panchayat\\". Each Nagar Panchayat has a committee consisting of a chairman with ward members. Membership consists of a minimum of ten elected ward members and three nominated members. The NAC members of the Nagar Panchayat are elected from the several wards of the Nagar Panchayat on the basis of adult franchise for a term of five years. There are seats reserved for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, backward classes and women. The Councillors or Ward Members are chosen by direct election from electoral wards in the Nagar Panchayat.

It was officially inaugurated January 5, 1898. Throughout most of its lifetime, 1897 to July 2008, it was part of the Long Island College Hospital (LICH). Joseph Korom, the author of The American Skyscraper (2008), considers the eight-story tower to be the first skyscraper hospital ever built. pp. 222 The clinic and adjacent row houses were designated part of the Cobble Hill Historic District in 1988., p. 2 History The Cobble Hill area of Brooklyn was settled by Europeans early in the seventeenth century and was included into the newly incorporated City of Brooklyn in 1834. Present-day street grid was designed in the same 1834 and by 1860 the former farmland was developed into a densely populated row house neighborhood with banks, churches and retail stores. Two row houses on the corner of Henry and Amity, later demolished to make way for the clinic, were built in 1853 by an Irish-American real estate developer Edward Wilson., p. 3 Construction of the building was financed by Caroline Herriman Polhemus (died 1906), the sister of William H. Herriman, who provided $400,000 to the Long Island College Hospital (LICH) in the memory of her husband Henry Ditmas Polhemus, who served as the Regent of LICH from 1872 until his death in 1895. Caroline Polhemus also donated a farm in Rockland County to the Brooklyn Children's Aid Society. In the summer of 1895 Caroline Polhemus purchased two corner row houses and demolished them., p. 4 An architectural contest to design the clinic attracted six bids; a young architect, Marshall Emery, won first prize of $500. Construction commenced in spring of 1897 and was completed in December 1897. Emery described his building, finished in French Renaissance motives, as \\"dignified and pleasing, at the same time having as strongly a marked, monumental and academic character as the peculiar arrangement of the interior will permit, while refraining from undue or lavish use of ornamentation\\"., p. 4, citing Brooklyn Eagle from November 3, 1895 Emery consulted with physicians and surgeons to design a thoroughly modern hospital. Separate entrances on each facade separated the students from hospital patients and staff. The building functions were separated vertically; originally, Pohlemus Clinic housed: * the hospital's dispensary in the first two floors; * administration and student locker rooms in the third floor; * training classes in the fourth to seventh floors; * and dissecting rooms of the Department of Anatomy in the eighth floor. The clinic was equipped with an elevator, steam heating, forced ventilation, electrical generators and one of the first x-ray machines in existence. After the United States entry into World War I, Polhemus Clinic provided x-ray facilities to the United States Marines. In July 2008 LICH closed and sold the Polhemus Building (then housing its departments of surgery and anaesthesia) and the maternity ward, citing the need to raise cash to escape bankruptcy. Doctors split over the decision, blaming Continuum Health Partners for the mismanagement of Brooklyn hospitals.

Ama Wray (born 1970), known formally as Sheron Wray, is a dancer, teacher, choreographer and theatre director. She studied under Jane Dudley Interview in memorial of Jane Dudley at londondance.com at the London Contemporary Dance School, later performing with the London Contemporary Dance Theatre and the Rambert Dance Company, and forming her own company JazzXchange in 1992. She presently is associate professor of dance at the Claire Trevor School of the Arts at the University of California, Irvine. As a performer, she is best known for her Jane Dudley's Harmonica BreakdownArticle about Wray and Harmonica Breakdown documentary and in her own Texterritory, a piece integrating live text message participation from the audience. Texterritory has been performed in Trafalgar Square as part of London's 2012 Olympic Bid, the Soho Theatre, New York University and other international venues. She was awarded a NESTA fellowship in 2003. Background Wray's foundation and background is modern dance and is grounded by her training at the London Contemporary Dance School in Graham technique. Other strong influences are Matt Mattox's approach to jazz, West African dance, and Afro-Cuban dance. She danced with London Contemporary Dance Theatre Rambert Dance Company. Repertoire included works by Mark Morris, Bill T. Jones and Arnie Zane, Anthoy Tudor, Paul Taylor, Ohad Naharin, Dan Wagoner and Jane Dudley. Wray is widely known for her role as the leading performer and legal custodian of Harmonica Breakdown (1938), choreographed by Jane Dudley. As custodian she continues to restage the work globally. In the UK as the artistic director of JazzXchange Music and Dance Company she created over 30 works including collaborations with Wynton Marsalis, Derek Bermel, Gary Crosby and Julian Joseph. For the UK's 2012 Cultural Olympiad Festival she was commissioned to choreograph The Brown Bomber, collaborating with composer Julian Joseph, performed at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London. Improvisation is central to the approach to creating in collaboration with jazz music and this is extended into the realm of technology. As the recipient of the coveted three-year NESTA Fellowship (National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts) a synthesis of modern dance, jazz improvisation and West African performance aesthetics was conceptualised in the award-winning Texterritory; an interactive performance platform created in collaboration with Fleeta Siegel. The format fractures the fourth wall and allows audience-agency to co-create the performance through their cell phones. It plays with time and proximity as it extends to enables post event engagement. Recent productions (2011) include Texterritory Congo, Digitally Ever Present and Texterritory USA (2008) with NYU's Experimental Theatre Wing. Wray's engagement with Africa and the African Diaspora began in 2004 with study and research into African and Afro-Cuban dance exclusively taking place on the continent of Africa and the Caribbean. Ghana, Guinea, Senegambia Zimbabwe, Uganda and Cuba have been places of exchange. Her contemporary African works have been seen on the Ghana Dance Ensemble, Discreet Discoveries ‚Äì an experimental work engaging, dance, music, text and audience interaction and Rhythm in Time with Danza Libre in Cuba for whom she has been a long time visiting choreographer. Additionally, she has directed African-centred physical theatre plays by activist playwright/performer Mojisola Adebayo. These plays include \\"Muhammad Ali and Me\\", a semi autobiographical one woman performance (although incorporated supporting actors) that combines poetry, dance, acapella singing, boxing and audience interaction that experimentally (and inclusively) incorporates integrated British Sign Language, https://www.alfredfagonaward.co.uk/features/muhammad- ali-and-me-by-mojisola-adebayo/ that detailed the struggles associated with growing up black in a majority white area (Essex, Colchester)https://superslowway.org.uk/projects/muhammad-ali-and-me/.

Muhammad Ali and Me and Moj of the Antarctic toured both the UK and Southern Africa, 2008‚Äì2010. For a non-traditional audience she performed an improvised solo Bodily Steps to Innovation for Tedx in Southern California. It poses cognitive dissonance as a way for the audience to access their creativity. She is an Assistant Professor of Dance ‚Äì University of California, Irvine and UCI she directs The Ghana Project: an interdisciplinary research project including five different UCI schools (Humanities, Social Science, Education, Arts and Computer Science) and the University of Ghana, Legon.

The current Smock Alley Theatre is a 21st-century theatre in Dublin, converted from a 19th- century church building, incorporating structural material from an 18th- century theatre building, and built on the site of the 17th century Theatre Royal, Dublin. The present theatre was opened in 2012, after a ‚Ç¨3.5 million investment.Smock Alley Theatre reopening after 225 years - New theatre set to open today on site of original facility which opened in 1662. 17 May 2012 The Smock Alley Theatre site comprises Smock Alley Theatre (178 seats), The Boys School (60 - 100 capacity), Black Box (80 capacity), and The Banquet Hall (300 capacity). History of the building =Theatre Royal= The first Theatre Royal was opened on the site by John Ogilby in 1662. Ogilby, who was the first Irish Master of the Revels, had previously run the New Theatre in Werburgh Street, which had closed during the Puritan interregnum. This building was entirely demolished, with a new theatre replacing it in 1735. This second building was active as a theatre until 1759, with a brief later revival until its final closure in 1787. First building (1662) The Theatre Royal consisted of a classical proscenium stage, pit, boxes, a middle and upper gallery, lattices (which were a type of box peculiar to Dublin) and a music/orchestra loft above the stage, also the acoustics were said to be excellent. The pit had backless benches and a raked floor that rose toward the back of the audience to help sightlines. Mostly single men sat here, and it was the noisiest, rowdiest area in the theatre. Boxes sat upper-class aristocrats. Boxes were luxuriously decorated with velvet drapes should the occupants require some privacy during the evening, for whatever reason. The doors were wider in the boxes to allow access for the voluminous dresses of the ladies. Galleries held the lower class, including servants of the upper classes in attendance. These were the worst seats as they were on the same level as the large chandeliers that lit the theatre. Candles were made of tallow (animal fat) and they were very pungent and smokey. The building was built on reclaimed ground from the River Liffey and due to this, in 1670 and later in 1701 the upper galleries collapsed killing several people inside and injuring many more including the son of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Charles Earl of Middlesex. He was pulled from the wreckage of his box with two broken legs There was another partial collapse in March 1734 after which it was abandoned for a short while. The major decision was then taken to demolish and rebuild the theatre in 1735 with increased audience capacity. Second building (1735) In the time between the demolition of the original theatre and the construction of its replacement, a new theatre had opened in Aungier Street and it managed to wrestle the title Theatre Royal from Smock Alley for a time. In 1745 Thomas Sheridan, godson of Jonathan Swift, took on the role of manager of Smock Alley and Aungier Street. He made many improvements and reclaimed the title Theatre Royal for Smock Alley. By 1750 the Aungier Street theatre had closed down. Sheridan was not only director of the theatre, he was also a playwright and strove to improve audiences at the theatre by cleaning up the neighbourhood in which it stood. At the time there were many unsavoury taverns and ale houses as well as many establishments of ill repute that Sheridan successfully petitioned to have closed down in favour of more wholesome and decent businesses. This change in the area encouraged more noble people to again return to the theatre and it once again thrived. Benjamin Victor was an Englishman who originally visited Ireland in an effort to extend his textile business, but that did not prove profitable, and he eventually gave it up. On 11 October 1746 Victor settled with his family in Dublin as treasurer and deputy-manager to Sheridan at the Smock Alley Theatre. The theatre was for some years fairly successful; but about 1753 Sheridan was at variance with a portion of the theatre-going public, and for two years Victor and John Sowdon, a principal actor in the company, took over its management. On 15 July 1755 Sheridan returned to Dublin, and Victor resumed his old position. Eventually the theatre was closed on 20 April 1759, and Victor returned to England. The theatre later reopened, being active until 1787, but Victor did not return - having become involved with the Drury Lane Theatre in his native London. Legacy The first Theatre Royal housed the plays of George Farquhar (The Recruiting Officer/The Beaux Stratagem), Oliver Goldsmith (She Stoops to Conquer) and Richard Brinsley Sheridan, son of Thomas Sheridan (The Rivals/School for Scandal). It was here that the stars of world theatre appeared to much acclaim such as Peg Woffington, Thomas Sheridan, Spranger Barry and Charles Macklin. It was on the stage of Smock Alley Theatre that David Garrick, the greatest actor of the 18th century, first played Hamlet. It was the first time Hamlet had ever been staged in Ireland and some 3,000 customer clambered to get one of only 300 tickets. It was also the site of some infamous 18th century Dublin riots, the most serious being the Kelly riots of 1747. Thomas Sheridan was manager at the time and had recently banned the presence of audience members on stage and the taking of money for the privilege of going backstage. These rules were for men only. Indeed, it was under Charles II that the law was changed to even allow women to act on stage. These rules were severely tested by a very drunk Trinity College student named Richard Kelly. Kelly did not appreciate the new rules restricting access backstage and brazenly went back stage. =St Michael and John's Church (1815)= In 1758, another rival theatre opened, and eventually the Theatre Royal at Smock Alley closed in 1787. After this, the building was used as a whiskey store, falling into heavy disrepair before purchase by Fr Michael Blake in 1811. The structure of the derelict building was partially demolished, and the new church incorporated some of this original theatre structure into its own during the building work, which was carried out between 1811 and 1815. The resultant new building was named St Michael and John's Church, after the medieval churches of St Michael of the Hill (now Dublinia) and St John of Booth Street (Fishamble Street). It had a famous stained glass window that is now in Swords. The theatre still boasts ornate stained glass windows and ceiling plasterwork which dates from the turn of the 20th century. When the bell tolled in 1811, 18 years before Catholic Emancipation; it was the first Catholic bell to ring in Dublin in nearly 300 years. This prompted the aldermen of the city to bring charges against Fr Blake, though these charges were dropped when young lawyer Daniel O'Connell came to his defence. In 1989, due to falling numbers of parishioners the church of St Michael and John was deconsecrated. It was then redeveloped (part of the Temple Bar rejuvenation scheme) into the 'Viking Adventure' which was closed down in 2002. =Excavation= In 2009, a full archaeological excavation took place under Margaret Gowan Archaeology. The dig revealed part of the foundations from the first theatre on the site built in 1662, and the full basement and foundation plan of the 1735 theatre. A total of 229 artefacts were recovered from the excavations, these included medieval and post-medieval pottery, glass finds (mostly wine bottles), clay tobacco-pipe fragments, an actor's wig curler, a medieval roof tile, fragments of mosaic floor and many oyster shells, remnants of the building's theatrical past.

It gets its name from its appearance when stained with iodine. Named for Otto B√ºtschli by Prowazek in 1912, Iodamoeba buetschlii is a nonpathogenic parasitic ameba, commonly found in the large intestines of people, pigs and other mammals. The distribution of I. buetschlii is worldwide. Most likely to be the original host, pigs are often targeted with I. buetschlii. I. buetschlii is identified as a non- pathogenic parasite. Often, this parasite is mistaken as a pathogenic parasite because non-pathogenic and pathogenic parasites have the same characteristics. In terms of illnesses, humans have a low prevalence of I. buetschlii (4-8%). I. buetschlii is an indicator of oral-fecal contamination and humans may experience diarrhea. Trophozoite The trophozoites are 9‚Äì14 micrometres in diameter. Trophozoites are one of the two forms of I. buetschlii. This form has a pseudopodia for locomotion. The pseudopodia is short and blunt. It moves in a slow manner. The trophozoite has a single nucleus, prominent for nuclear endosome and many cytoplasmic vacuoles. The ectoplasm and the granular endoplasm are often hard to distinguish. The nucleus is fairly large and vesicular, containing a large endosome, surrounding by light staining granules about midway between it and the nuclear membrane. Achromatic strands stretch between the endosome and nuclear membrane without any peripheral granules. Food vacuoles are commonly filled with bacteria and yeast. Trophozoites are often identified by a stool smear, found in loose stools. File:I.Butschlii- trophozoites1.jpg Cyst The cysts are 8‚Äì10 micrometres in diameter, with a thick wall and a large glycogen vacuole that stains darkly with iodine. Usually harmless, it may cause amebiasis in immunologically compromised individuals. As the second form of I. butschlii, cysts have an oval shaped- single nucleus with a prominent nuclear endosome. This form is also large, single, glycogen-filled vacuole called iodinophilous vacuole (glycogen stains with iodine). Cysts are the infective stage of I. buetschlii. Unlike trophozoites, cysts are often found in formed stools. File:I.Butschlii- cysts1.jpg Lifecycle trophozoite in cecum & colon>cyst in feces- ingested>trophozoite in cecum & colon File:Iodamoeba butschlii lifecycle.jpg Treatment In a research study, amebas were seen in stool samples of a patient and identified as I. buetschlii. The patient was treated with dehydroemetine and chloroquine. After treatment they noticed the patient's complement fixation titer decreased to 1:2 in a serum sample, obtained two months later.

It is the Dillards' fourth album, and their first to move away from their traditional bluegrass sound by using a full orchestra, electric instrumentation and occasional drums. The band had been moving toward a more contemporary sound for a few years (they toured with The Byrds, featuring founding banjoist Doug Dillard on a Rickenbacker-built electric version of his instrument and future Buffalo Springfield drummer Dewey Martin), but Wheatstraw Suite was the first time they explored the new sound on a full-length album. The seeds of the album began when the Dillards briefly left Elektra Records, which had released their first three records but was \\"surprisingly resistant\\" to the band's new sound. The group recorded a few folk rock singles for Capitol Records, including different versions of a few of Wheatstraw Suite's songs. Capitol, however, soon grew unsympathetic toward the Dillards' style, and they re-signed with Elektra, which was now willing to try the new, more commercial sound. However, Doug Dillard was unhappy with the new direction and abruptly left the group. Ironically, he would soon be performing a similar type of country rock with former Byrd Gene Clark as Dillard & Clark. The Dillards recruited multi- instrumentalist Herb Pedersen to replace Doug on banjo. The loss of Doug proved to be advantageous to the group, as Pedersen also contributed guitar and shared lead vocal duties with Rodney Dillard. The group had already stockpiled plenty of material during their stint with Capitol and brief hiatus from recording. The album features seven original songs and six covers‚Äîthe covers being drawn mostly from contemporary rock and pop musicians rather than traditionals. The Dillards' blend between pop and bluegrass on this album paved the way for a generation of country- and folk-rockers, making it potentially their most influential album.

It is famous for its ability to change from an amoeba, which lacks a cytoplasmic microtubule cytoskeleton, to a flagellate, which has an elaborate microtubule cytoskeleton, including flagella. This \\"transformation\\" includes de novo synthesis of basal bodies (or centrioles). Background It was first characterized in 1899, and the genome sequence published in 2010. Naegleria gruberi is a non-pathogenic biosafety level 1 organism, although it is related to the deadly Naegleria fowleri.https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/faqs.html Naegleria gruberi is a free-living organism that can be extracted from wet soil and freshwater The strain NEG-M is the only Naegleria species that has a fully sequenced genome. Naegleria belongs to the Jakobids, Euglenozoans, and Heteroloboseans (JEH) group. The Naegleria genome sequence has indicated that the amoeboflagellate contains actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, mitotic and meiotic machinery, and several transcription factors. Naegleria's mitochondrial genome encodes some components of a mitochondrial c and c1 maturation system.https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/biology.html Naegleria's mitochondria resembles the evolutionary intermediate thought to have occurred within the ancestor of all eukaryotes, because of its presence of mitochondrial Fe-hydrogenase and complete aerobic respiration system. The Naegleria genome is able to oxidize glucose, various amino acids and fatty acids through the Krebs cycle. The ancestor of existing eukaryotes have been thought to contain a fair number of introns. Nearly 36% of Naegleria genes are assumed to contain at least one intron and 17% contain multiple introns. The position of the introns are conserved, indicating that they are ancient. Naegleria amoeba undergo a closed mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope doesn't break down, but still proceeds through the typical stages. The multitubulin hypothesis predicts that eukaryotes contain multiple tublin genes with distinct properties. Naegleria uses different tubulins for mitosis and flagellar assembly. Observations suggest that Naegleria is primarily an asexual organism that reproduces by division of its amoebae to produce substantial clonal populations. However, analysis of the genome strain NEG-M revealed that it is a composite of two distinct haplotypes having arisen from an interbreeding population. Therefore, Naegleria is likely to be able to undergo genetic exchange. The NEG-M strain is the heterozygous result of a past mating of two strains, and it appears genetically equipped to mate again. However, further studies still need to be performed.

The village is in the Forbes Shire local government area, west of the state capital, Sydney. At the 2006 census, Ootha and the surrounding area had a population of 94. The place name is derived from an aboriginal word for 'ear'. Ootha is situated approximately 10 km from Mount Derriwong, which is recognised by surveyors as sporting the central Trig Station for NSW. History Ootha Post Office opened on 15 December 1914 and closed in 1980. The primary school opened in 1933 and drew attendances from single digit numbers to the high twenties over the course of its life. The school was a single-teacher school throughout its life. One of those teachers was Eric Woodward, who went on to become the Minister for Education in the NSW government. Many of the pupils who passed through the school were the children of a transient fettler population whose main purpose was the maintenance of the railway line. The general store was taken over by Jonnie and Isabelle Hamer, who purchased the store from Clarrie Buckland in 1951. Jonnie died after three days of taking possession of the store and Jack Hamer and his wife and Molly came from Sydney to give his mother a hand and ultimately stayed on until 1975 when the store was subject to a fire that razed it to the ground. The goodwill for the business was purchased soon after by Barry Yetman from nearby Yarrabandai and he set up shop in the disused Ootha Motors premises. In the 1950s and 60s the village prospered from the surrounding farming community with both the garage (Ootha Motors) and the General store drawing customers from a thirty to forty mile radius. The town had a cricket team and a tennis team, both of which were competitive in local district competitions. Competition from both Condobolin and ultimately Parkes and Forbes put paid to the viability of the Ootha businesses after the roads to Condobolin and then to Parkes were tarred, thus making it much easier for residents to shop in the larger towns. Large farming properties such as Burrawang West and Melgutherie were well known properties through the NSW farming. The garage met its demise with the passing of Roy Harvey, but mechanical repairs were offered by Alan Ross who opened a new garage soon after. During those years, much of the town and surrounding population were made up of people of the Plymouth Brethren faith and they had a meeting hall within the village which has subsequently been sold as a residence. The village also sported a Presbyterian church which still stands. The railway was part of the Sydney to Broken Hill line. The Silver City Comet was a train service that operated from September 1937 until November 1989 between Parkes and Broken Hill. In 1970, the first run of the Indian Pacific between Sydney and Perth was completed, but not until after the railway siding having to be moved after one of the carriages collected the siding in the trial stage. Apart from the passenger services (including a daily Rail Motor service between Condobolin and Parkes) the rail provided for substantial freight movements west of Parkes. In particular, the movement of wheat from the silos situated on the western fringe of the village was substantial and each year saw wheat trucks lined up for up to one kilometre whilst waiting to dump their load. Shopkeeper and Stock and station agent Jack Hamer eased that issue by bringing the concept of mesh bins to farmers in the district in the early 1960s. This allowed farmers to temporarily store their wheat on their farms pending movement to the silos in a more orderly fashion. Burrawang West was purchased by a Japanese consortium for the purpose of a \\"resort\\" to bring foreign visitors to the western districts of NSW. The resort has passed through a number of hands and has now reverted to a fully functioning farming property and is home to the Burrawang White Dorper Stud. The property also runs fat lambs and has retained the residential site as a private retreat which caters for leisure and business groups. Access roads from Ootha to Burrawang West also provide for an unusual tourist phenomenon locally known as the Utes in the Paddock\\" (http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/country-nsw/parkes- area/condobolin/attractions/utes-in-the-paddock) . The village has suffered the small town symptoms that have been the bugbear of many similar villages in NSW and is now a minor residential dormitory in the centre of NSW and has no retail or other services available to its residents.

Rugby career Badger came to prominence playing for Llanelli. He was part of the team that won the South Wales Challenge Cup during the 1893/94 under the captaincy of Ben James. While playing for Llanelli, Badger was first chosen to represent Wales in a game against England as part of the 1895 Home Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of Wales legend Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, Wales lost the game 6-14, mainly due to far better play from the English forwards. Although appearing on the losing side, Badger was reselected for the very next game. The Scotland game was a much closer affair, but Wales lost this match too, though the final game of the tournament at home to Ireland saw Wales victorious thanks to Billy Bancroft's conversion of a Tom Pearson try. This match was Badger's only appearance on a winning international team under the rugby union code. His final amateur match for Wales was in the next season's opening game of the Championship. It was a torrid game for Wales and Badger, as in the first 15 minutes of the match, he broke his collar bone in a tackle and was forced to leave the pitch.Godwin (1984), pg 46. With replacements not allowed, the Welsh team played on with 14 men and saw seven tries scored against them without reply. Badger's replacement for the next match was Gwyn Nicholls, one of the finest threequarters in Welsh rugby. Wales team of 1895 that faced England. Badger sat front row, far left. Whether Badger would have regained his position in the Welsh team is unknown, as he switched codes to professional rugby league in 1897. His fee for switching to Swinton was ¬£75, with a match fee of ¬£2, 10 shillings a week. Badger's family remained in Wales while he played in Manchester. This fact caused repercussions for Swinton, when Badger's actions caused the club to forfeit two league points when he took time off work to visit his sick children in Wales. On his return, Swinton forgot to ask permission from the Northern Union (now the Rugby Football League (RFL) to reintroduce Badger into the team, and the club was duly penalised.Collins, Tony; Rugby's Great Split: Class, Culture and the origins of Rugby League Football, Frank Cass Publishers, (1998) pg 172.

The property was acquired in the 1930s as a family summer retreat by the noted conservationist and writer Aldo Leopold and is the landscape that inspired his conservation ethic and the writing of his best-known work, A Sand County Almanac. The property is now owned and managed by the Aldo Leopold Foundation, which provides tours and other educational programs on the property and the adjacent visitors center. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2009. Description and history The Aldo Leopold Farm is a property of about located on the south bank of the Wisconsin River northeast of Baraboo, Wisconsin. The property is roughly rectangular in shape, extending south from the river, and roughly bisected by Levee Road. A visitors' center maintained by the Aldo Leopold Foundation is located about east of the property at the junction of Levee and Schemp Roads. The soil in the region is sandy, the result of deposition during the Cambrian Period that was reworked by the Wisconsin glaciation. The former farm is biologically diverse, with floodplain forest and marshland and former fields that have been restored to native prairie. The principal built feature of the farm is the former chicken coop, set midway between Levee Road and the river, where Leopold spent his time; there is also a small outhouse nearby. Leopold began buying land here in 1935, acquiring more than by the time of his death in 1948. The family continued to acquire land until 1970, including a small island in the river. The family then donated the property to the Aldo Leopold Foundation, which now manages it. Leopold's writings on conservation and the environment were significantly influenced by this landscape. A Sand County Almanac, a compilation of his writings, is widely regarded as one of the most influential works on conservationism of the 20th century.

Rous' daughter Mary married Richard Bulkeley (governor) and is buried in the Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia). Family and early life Rous was born in Charlestown, Middlesex, Massachusetts on 21 May 1702, to William Rouse (Rows) and Mary, n√©e Peachie.  King George's War  He became a privateer during King George's War, part of the War of the Austrian Succession carried out in the North American colonies of Britain and France.Murdoch. History of Nova Scotia. Vol. 2. p. 391 He appears to have been in the navy in April and May 1740, serving as master's mate aboard the 50-gun . ON the ship Young Eagle, he made raids on the French fishing fleets and ports on the north shore of Newfoundland. He went on to command his own privateer ship, the 20-gun snow , serving as second in command of the New England naval forces at the Siege of Louisbourg in 1745. On 19 May 1745 he came to the assistance of HMS Mermaid, which was engaged with the 64-gun French . He was the first to render assistance, and the French ship was duly captured. Rous was rewarded for his efforts by Rear-Admiral Sir Peter Warren, who ordered Vigilante be purchased for the navy, and appointed Rous third lieutenant of her on 22 June 1745. Rous remained as captain of the Shirley and was sent to London in July, carrying Warren's dispatches. Warren purchased the Shirley on her return, and on 24 September 1745 Rous was appointed a captain and given command of her. He was present at the Battle at Port-la-Joye. In September 1746 with Annapolis Royal under threat of attack by the remnants of Duc d'Anville's fleet, Captain Rous, commanding the Shirley, was ordered to assist in the defence of the fort. There he along with Captain Richard Spry \\"agreed to haul their ships under the Fort upon the arrival of the fleet and land their men and guns for the defence of it.\\"Charles Morris.

A Brief Survey of Nova Scotia. p. 53. The Shirley was paid off in June 1747, and on 7 May 1749 he took over the 14-gun HMS Albany.  Father Le Loutre's War  Rous was also the senior naval officer on the Nova Scotia station during Father Le Loutre's War (1749‚Äì1755). The main officer under his command was Silvanus Cobb. He made a significant contribution to the preservation of Halifax and the defeat of the French, Acadian and Mi'kmaq resistance. He commanded the Albany. As the admiralty did not provide effective naval forces for the defence of Nova Scotia, Rous improvised to establish and protect the new British settlements at Halifax, Lunenburg, and Lawrencetown. He also worked to protect the long established British settlements at Canso and Annapolis Royal, as well as the new British forts in the Acadian communities of Grand Pre (Fort Vieux Logis), Pisiquid (Fort Edward) and Chignecto (see Battle at Chignecto). Under his command were three 14-gun sloops of the Royal Navy, the occasional man-of-war from England, and several New England coasting vessels. In 1753, Rous was a member of the Nova Scotia Council. He took command of the 14-gun in 1753, and in 1755 led the naval force at the Battle of Fort Beaus√©jour.

He went on to take part at the capture of Quebec in 1759, leading Admiral Sir Charles Saunders's fleet up the river, and landing troops for the attack under General James Wolfe.

A rimless, smokeless powder design, this cartridge was considered to be very accurate by period firearm experts and suitable for game up to deer and black bear. The .25 Remington cartridge dates to 1906 and its introduction by Remington in the Model 8 rifle. Other rifles chambered for the .25 Remington include the Remington 14 slide-action, Remington 30 bolt action, Stevens 425 lever-action, and Standard Arms rifles. Due to their similar dimensions, the .25 Remington, .30 Remington, and .32 Remington together were known as the Remington Rimless cartridge series. Firearm manufacturers generally offered all three of these cartridges as chamberings in a rifle model rather than just one of the series. The series was competitive with Winchester Repeating Arms Company's contemporary lever action offerings: .25-35 Winchester, .30-30, and .32 Winchester Special. The .25 Remington case was shortened and necked down to .22 caliber to form Lysle Kilbourn's wildcat .22 Kilbourn Magnum Junior and the rimless version of Leslie Lindahl's wildcat .22 Chucker. Harvey Donaldson also used the .25 Remington case in early experiments that would eventually lead to the creation of the .219 Donaldson Wasp. Donaldson later switched his experimentation to Winchester .219 Zipper brass after the launch of that cartridge in 1937. The bore diameter of the .25 Remington is .250 inches (6.35 mm) making it a \\".25\\"/6.35 mm caliber\\", not to be confused with the more well known 6.5 mm bore caliber which uses 6.7 mm/.264\\" bullets.

Biography Kendra Norman is a native of West Palm Beach, Florida, but spent most of her formative years in southern Georgia. She graduated from Brooks County High School in Quitman, Georgia. Kendra and her husband, Michael Holmes, share a blended family of two daughters and one son. Her first husband, Jimmy (whose last name was also Holmes - no relation to Michael) died. She and Jimmy married at St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal Church in Valdosta, GA when Kendra was 21 and Jimmy was 20.Author finds purpose out of lost love, Gracie Bond Staples, The Atlanta Journal - Constitution [Atlanta, Ga] 16 Apr 2008: E.1. . Shortly after their daughter Crystal was born, Jimmy was diagnosed with AIDS, possibly as the result of a blood transfusion. He died on October 5, 1995, a few days before their 7th wedding anniversary, and in her grief, Kendra began to write. She crafted her first piece of poetry as an elementary school student, but Kendra did not grow to recognize her gift as a creative writer until 1999 when she began keeping a journal during the lingering heartache of the death of her husband. Shortly thereafter, she wrote her first fictional manuscript, For Love & Grace, published in 2002. She worked days, and in the evenings, she pursued higher education at Valdosta Technical College (Valdosta, Georgia), where she majored in Information Office Technology and graduated in 1997. There, she was inducted into the National Vocational Technical Honor Society. She was given a computer as a college graduation gift. Her life took many twists and turns during the years following Jimmy's death. Most of her true life experience is captured in two of her nonfiction published works, I Shall Not Die and The Path From Pain to Purpose, both of which are highly acclaimed books. Kendra eventually found true love again, and she and her current husband, Michael married in 2014. In 2017, Kendra and Michael jointly wrote a 31-day relationship devotional entitled Cross-Fire. It was her twenty-second published work and her husband's first. The book has received rave reviews from readers.

Its invention is credited to tennis player Mary Browne in 1926 during her tenure as a coach at the University of Chicago. The main advantage of the backboard is that it provides a realistic and challenging emulation of regulation tennis, while also being more enjoyable. In 1938 a restraining line was added so that players would not stand unrealistically close to the wall.

Inspired by Parabel der Blinden (1568), a painting by Netherlandish artist Pieter Bruegel, the novel tells the story of the work's creation from the point of view of the six blind men depicted in the painting. The story is recounted in the present tense, first person plural. The \\"we\\" that comprises the six blind men often seems to consist of one entity; however, most of the men have separate names and identities and will sometimes say or do things that distinguish them from the group. Synopsis The action of the story is concerned with the six blind men who are hired to be painted by an unnamed painter (whom the reader will come to realize is Bruegel) and their confused journey to the painter's house. After becoming lost, nearly drowned, and attacked by a dog, the men finally arrive at the painter's house where they are fed and warmed (and nearly burned by the fire). The blind men are then led to a bridge and are told to walk across it in a line, holding on to each other and screaming and eventually falling into the stream, repeatedly, while the painter paints them from inside his open window.

It also served as an airfield during World War II. History Peleliu Airfield was built by the Japanese in 1944 with a pair of intersecting runways. During the Battle of Peleliu on 15 September 1944, 11,000 Japanese defended the island when the 1st Marine Division assaulted landing on the southwest corner of the island, just to the west of the airfield. On D+1, the 5th Marines moved to capture the airfield and push toward the eastern shore. They quickly raced across the airfield under heavy artillery fire from the highlands to the north, suffering heavy casualties in the process. After capturing the airfield, they rapidly advanced to the eastern end of Peleliu, leaving the island's southern defenders to be wiped out by the 7th Marines. This area was hotly contested by the Japanese, who still occupied numerous pillboxes. Temperatures remained around 115 ¬∞F (46 ¬∞C), and the Marines soon suffered high casualties from heat exhaustion. Further complicating their situation, the Marines' only available water supply was contaminated with oil. Still, by D+8 the 5th and 7th Marines accomplished their objectives, holding the airfield and the southern portion of the island. Having quickly captured the airfield, Seabees from the 33rd and 73rd Naval Construction Battalions had it operational by D+3. The \\"Grasshoppers\\" (VMO-1) soon began aerial spotting missions for Marine artillery and Naval gunfire. On 26 September 1944 (D+11), the Corsairs of the VMF-114 landed on the airstrip. The Corsairs began dive- bombing missions across Peleliu, and also brought two more useful weapons to the fight against Japanese fortifications. Corsairs fired rockets, to blow open cave entrances for the infantrymen, and also delivered napalm attacks only the second time the weapon had been used in the Pacific. The napalm proved useful, burning away vegetation hiding spider holes, and killing their occupants. After liberation, the Seabees further repaired, expanded and upgraded the airfield. The airbase was under the command of Colonel Karl S. Day. In December 1944, the two runways measured and . A PBY that took off from Peleliu on 3 August 1945 was the first to locate survivors of the 4 days after it was sunk. The USAAF Seventh Air Force moved the F-5-equipped 28th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron to Peleliu from Kwajalein on 5 October 1944 to carry out long-range photographic missions over the Philippines. The recon squadron remained until April, 1945 when it was moved northwest to Okinawa. * Maurer, Maurer (1983). Air Force Combat Units Of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History. . After the end of the war, Peleliu and its airfield were abandoned by the Americans. Today the vegetation on the island, which was largely burnt out by the battle, has regrown and has replaced the scars of war. As it had been heavily defended by the Japanese, there are still tanks, Amtracs, an A6M Zero, canteens, helmets, etc., scattered in the jungle from the war. The airfield still exists, and has limited use with the SW-NE runway still usable, but for light aircraft only.

The Bonin Islands are part of Japan. Today, the base is the only airfield on the island, operated by the Japan Self-Defense Forces. History South and Central Fields Iwo Jima 1945 Airfields Located south and west of the midpoint between Tokyo and Saipan, the island of Iwo Jima was needed by the United States Army Air Forces as an emergency landing site for its B-29 Superfortress strategic bombing campaign against the Empire of Japan. The purpose of the assault was to take the island for the three Japanese airfields so that the U.S. Navy Seabees could turn them in to United States facilities. Prior to the assault NCB 133 was assigned to get Motoyama #1 operational and NCB 31 was assigned Motoyama #2. On D-plus 5 that was changed because of the casualties the 133rd had taken and the 31st CB was assigned to Motoyama #1. On D-plus 6 the assignments were changed again. The 62nd CB attached to the reserve in V Amphibious Corps was given Motoyama #1, the 31st CB was given Motoyama #2 and the 133rd was given Motoyama #3. However, the Seabees worked together until the Marines had taken possession of their respective airfield work assignments. Motoyama #2 known today as the Central Field was laid out as an \\"X\\" of two intersecting runways. Reconstruction and expansion work was held up by the protracted land battle, on 16 March it became operational, with the east-northeast to west-southwest runway graded to 5,200-feet (1,585-meters) and the east-west runway to 4,800-feet (1,463-meters). A second runway parallel to the east-northeast to west-southwest runway was also built; both were built to accommodate B-29s. By 7 July 1945, the first B-29 runway had been paved to 8,500 feet (2,591-meters) and placed in operation. During the day, 102 B-29s, returning from a raid on Japan, landed on the field. Several sub-grade failures occurred in the construction because of ground water and soft spots in the sub-grade. In some places the paving sealed off steam which had been generated below the surface and when the steam condensed, the sub-grade became saturated. By 12 July, the B-29 runway had been completed and paved for a length of 9,800-by-200-feet (2,987-by-61-meters). The parallel runway was eventually lengthened to 9,400-feet (2,865-meters), both with a width of 200-feet (61-meters). The east-west runway built by the Japanese was developed into a fueling strip, 6,000-by-570-feet (1,829-by-174-meters), with 60 fueling outlets. For normal operations, this field could accommodate 120 P-51s and 30 B-24s and 20 B-29s. Central Field was headquarters for VII Fighter Command of the Twentieth Air Force from March 1 ‚Äì December 1, 1945, along with the intelligence-gathering 41st Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron from August though mid-September 1945. Operational fighter squadrons which performed B-29 escort missions from Central Field were: * 506th Fighter Group, April 24 ‚Äì December 3, 1945 * 414th Fighter Group, July 7 ‚Äì December 23, 1945 * 21st Fighter Group, July 16 ‚Äì December 4, 1945 * 548th Night Fighter Squadron, March 5 ‚Äì June 12, 1945 * 549th Night Fighter Squadron, (Ground Echelon), March 14, 1945 ‚Äì February 5, 1946 After the war, the 20th Air Force fighter squadrons moved out to Japan, Okinawa or the Philippines and Central Field came under the Jurisdiction of Military Air Transport Service (MATS), becoming a refueling stop for MATS aircraft in the Western Pacific. It hosted various communications, weather as well as Far East Materiel Command units for supply and maintenance activities. It was under the command of the Iwo Jima Base Command, as a satellite of the 6000th Support Wing, Tachikawa Air Base, Japan. It was likely classified as a remote assignment for military personnel, as other than rudimentary medical and personnel living facilities, no family housing or other quality of life facilities were built to accommodate families for accompanied tours. A third Japanese airfield (Motoyama No. 3) was also reconstructed as \\"North Field\\". It required much new construction in rough terrain which consisted principally of consolidated volcanic ash. The initial portion of the work in preparing the sub-grade for the runway entailed the moving of about 200,000-cubic-yards (152,911-cubic-meters) of rock and volcanic ash. Seabee construction was stopped on 27 April and the project was turned over to a USAAF aviation engineer battalion for completion. By V-J day a runway 6,000-feet (1,829-meters) long, had been graded and was paved to 5,500-feet (1,676-meters); 10,000-feet (3,048-meters) of taxiways had been graded; and 129 fighter hardstands provided. This field could normally accommodate 50 P-51s and 14 B-24s (and eight B-29s in an emergency). North Field was abandoned after the war; its facilities were used for revetments and munitions storage in support of the other two airfields. Central Field stayed in American hands until being turned over to the Japanese Government on 27 June 1968.AFHRA Document 00462016 6100th Support Wing 1 April-30 June 1968 It then became a navigation and weather station of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (Nihon Kaijo Jieitai), and is still used by the U.S. military as an aircraft refueling depot and as a U.S. Navy special pilot training facility. At any given time about 350 JSDF personnel are posted to Iwo Jima and though the airfield is strictly for military use, commercial flights carrying veterans are frequent visitors.

Biography Charles Lampe was born in London, one year into his parents' marriage. His father was a successful composer of stage music and his mother was a celebrated soprano who often appeared in her husband's operas. Isabella was also a part of the well known Young family of musicians. Charles was named after his grandfather, Charles Young, who was a notable organist and composer. His great uncle, Anthony Young, was also a notable organist and composer. Charles's Aunt Cecilia (1712-1789), was one of the greatest English sopranos of the eighteenth century and the wife of composer Thomas Arne. His Aunt Esther was a well known contralto and wife to Charles Jones, a successful music publisher in England during the eighteenth century. Three of his cousins, Isabella, Elizabeth, and Polly Young were all successful singers, and his cousin Michael Arne was a successful composer.Olive Baldwin, Thelma Wilson: \\"Cecilia Young\\", Grove Music Online ed.

The Teatro Gran Rex is an Art Deco style theatre in Buenos Aires, Argentina which opened on July 8, 1937, as the largest cinema in Argentina. Located near the centre of the city at 857 Corrientes Avenue, it was designed by the architect Alberto Prebisch, who was also in charge of the construction of the Obelisk, one of the main icons of the city. The design of the interior was influenced by that of Radio City Music Hall in New York City and construction of the theatre was completed in just seven months in association with the engineer Adolfo Moret. The opening caused a sensation and the Argentine intellectual Victoria Ocampo praised the theatre as an outstanding example of modern architecture from the pages of her influential literary journal, Sur. Today, the theatre has 3,300 seats and, together with the Teatro Opera on the opposite side of the street, is one of the city's most important venues for the staging of international shows. Chiquititas was the highest-grossing event in the history of the theater (Casi √°ngeles was the second). Based on the children-oriented soap of the same name and with the complete cast of the show, six seasons of live musicals were performed at the Gran Rex from 1996 to 2001 during the Winter Holidays.

The Volcano Islands are part of Japan. The airfield was located on the southern corner of Iwo Jima located on the Motoyama plateau, to the north of Mount Suribachi. South Field was significant to the overall Battle of Iwo Jima. History Built by the Japanese, the base included three intersecting runways. On 2 January 1944, more than a dozen B-24 Liberator bombers raided Airfield No. 1 and inflicted heavy damage. Commander of the island, Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi diverted more than 600 men, 11 trucks, and 2 bulldozers for immediate repairs. As a result, the airfield again became operational after only twelve hours.HyperWar: USMC Operation in WWII: Vol IV‚ÄîWestern Pacific Operations, Part VI ‚Äì Iwo Jima It was used by the Japanese until 19 February 1945 when the United States Marines landed on the island. It was the assignment of the 133rd Naval Construction Battalion to get this airfield operational as soon as the Marines had secured it. By the time that happened the 133rd had taken so many casualties supporting the 23rd Marines that the assignment was first given to the 31st CB but the 62nd CB ended up with it. Even so, all three battalions worked together to get it operational. It was during the fight to secure this airfield that Medal of Honor recipient Gunnery Sergeant John Basilone was killed by a Japanese mortar shell. 4 March 1945: Dinah Might was the first B-29 to make an emergency landing on Iwo Jima. Greeted by a thousand Marines and Seebees, she was repaired, refueled and flown out of South Field while the fighting was still going on. The airfield became a battlefield during the Battle of Iwo Jima. It was put into action by the Americans as the battle still raged. At South Field, the east-northeast to west-southwest runway was being used by observation planes as early as 26 February (D plus 7) when the first American aircraft landed on the strip, an OY-1 Sentinel piloted by Lt. Harvey Olson of VMO-4. By 2 March the runway had been graded to 4,000-feet (1,219-meters). Later, on 4 March with the battle still raging a B-29 Superfortress named Dinah Might from the 9th Bombardment Group (Very Heavy) landed, the first of 2,400 emergency landings by American aircraft at South Field and North Field on Iwo Jima.Hammel, p.207 On 9 March, this airfield paid its first dividend when a B-29 in distress came in for an emergency landing. Two days later the Twentieth Air Force P-51 Mustangs of the 15th and 21st Fighter Groups came up from Saipan for long-range B-29 fighter escort operations. From then on, South Field was in constant use while construction was continued. On 16 March, US Navy PB4Y-1's (Navy version of the B-24) patrol bombers of VPB-116 arrived at this airfield from Tinian. The patrol bombers performed various missions from South Field through the remainder of the war. The PB4Y-1 were later relieved by PB4Y-2 aircraft. On 7 April 1945, P-51s took off from South Field to form the first land-based fighter escort for B-29s on a strike against the Japanese homeland. By July, the runway had been extended to 6,000-by-200-feet (1,829-by-61-meters) and had been surfaced with emulsified asphalt. Also constructed were 7,950-feet (2,423-meters) of taxiways and 258 hardstands. This field could accommodate 100 P-51s and 30 B-24 Liberators. In an emergency, B-29s could land here. Fighter escort operations took place from March until November 1945. Marine at a Japanese antiaircraft gun overlooking Motoyama No 1 airfield South and Central Fields Iwo Jima 1945 After the war, the 20th Air Force fighter squadrons moved out to Japan, Okinawa or the Philippines and South Field came under the Jurisdiction of Military Air Transport Service (MATS), becoming a refueling stop for MATS aircraft in the Western Pacific. It hosted various communications, weather as well as Far East Materiel Command units for supply and maintenance activities. It was under the command of the Iwo Jima Base Command, as a satellite of the 6000th Support Wing, Tachikawa Air Base, Japan. It was likely classified as a remote assignment for military personnel, as other than rudimentary medical and personnel living facilities, no family housing or other quality of life facilities were built to accommodate families for accompanied tours.

The killings gained nationwide attention, with many suspecting that they were the work of the Ku Klux Klan or a similar white supremacist group. However, in June 1981, a 23-year-old African American named Wayne Williams was arrested for first-degree murder in the deaths of 27-year-old Nathaniel Carter and 29-year-old Jimmy Ray Payne. Eight months later, Williams was convicted of both killings and sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment. Some parties speculate that Williams was not the real killer, and that local law enforcement officials used him as a scapegoat to bring a seemingly unsolvable case to a close. However, it is generally presumed that Williams was the culprit in most of the murders, if not all of them. No one was ever tried in connection with the other killings.

History Saipan had been occupied by the Japanese since World War I, and by mid-1944, the Americans had advanced inside the Japanese ring of defense in the Pacific Theater. By establishing air bases in the Mariana Islands, the United States Army Air Forces could establish bases to conduct long-range strategic offensive air operations over the Japanese Home Islands with the new B-29 Superfortress, which, during early 1944, was operating ineffectively from bases in China. Bringing the superfortresses into the Central Pacific and stationing them in the Marianas would bring Japan within the range of the B-29, as well as provide the Twentieth Air Force with reliable means of support from the western ports of the United States. The landings on Saipan began at 07:00 on June 15, 1944, and more than 300 LVTs landed 8,000 United States Marines on the west coast of the island. However the liberation of the island was a sad chapter of the tenacious fighting that lie ahead for the Allied forces, with the Japanese mounting a fanatical military defense and the fighting causing numerous civilian deaths. The island was the first objective of the 2nd and 4th Marine Divisions of the 5th Amphibious Corps. In addition to the Marine infantry units, the United States Army 27th Infantry Division was in reserve and went ashore on the south of the island, under heavy Japanese fire. For the next three weeks, Japanese counterattacks and Banzai charges bloodied the US forces as they fought their way to the north. Many of the Japanese civilian population of the island committed mass suicide by jumping off cliffs at Marpi Point or committing suicide with hand grenades in caves. An estimated 22,000 civilians died in the battle. In addition, the Japanese commanders, Lt. General Saito and Navy Admiral Nagumo committed suicide in a cave. It took until July 9, 1944 until sustained combat ended and the island was declared officially secured by the US forces. Once the island was secure, the construction of American large airfields could proceed. By the end of 1944 East Field (also known as Kagman Point Airfield) was built by Seabees of the 51st Naval Construction Battalion on the Kagman Peninsula at the eastern end of the island, north of Magicienne Bay (Laulau Bay). The airfield become the headquarters of the Seventh Air Force as well as its subordinate commands, VII Bomber and VII Fighter. This was the first time all of the major command units of the Seventh Air Force were consolidated into one location. The airfield's facilities included a single runway x running east to west (as of December 1944). An extensive taxiway and revetment area was located to the south of the airfield and north of the runway. Tower code was named 'Violet'. Operational units assigned to the station were initially P-47 Thunderbolt fighter squadrons of the 318th Fighter Group which moved in from Hawaii in early July to support ground combat units in the Marianas. Also, the 6th Night Fighter Squadron operated P-61 Black Widows to provide night fighter defense against Japanese night air attacks. Over the next few months, Seventh Air Force built up their forces on Saipan, assigning the following units to East Field: * 28th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron, July 11, 1944 ‚Äì May 1945 (F-4 (P-38 Lighting)) * 30th Bombardment Group, August 4, 1944 ‚Äì February 1945 (B-24 Liberator) * 9th Troop Carrier Squadron, August 4, 1944 ‚Äì July 1946 (C-47) * 548th Night Fighter Squadron, December 15, 1944 ‚Äì January 28, 1945 (DET), January 26 ‚Äì March 5, 1945 (P-61 Black Widow) * 41st Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron, January 4 ‚Äì April 15, 1946 (F-4 (P-38 Lighting)) * 549th Night Fighter Squadron, (Air Echelon), February 20, 1945 ‚Äì March 20, 1945 (P-61 Black Widow) * 21st Fighter Group, December 4, 1945 ‚Äì April 17, 1946 (P-51H Mustang) By mid-1946 most USAAF units were reassigned, and the military use of Kagman Point Airfield ended. It was used as an airport until the mid-1960s when it was closed. The land was then redeveloped with housing and a golf course built on the former World War II airfield.

It is located near the entrance of Queen Charlotte Sound / T≈çtaranui, west of nearby Motuara Island and Long Island. Explorer James Cook anchored his ships here and hence named it Ship Cove; however, in 2014 the official name was altered to \\"Meretoto / Ship Cove\\", to reflect its original MƒÅori name. While Ship Cove is a descriptive name, little is known about the origin of the name . One possible translation is \\"bloody \\". Approximately of land at the cove was declared a scenic reserve in administered by the Ship Cove Scenic Reserves Board. In 1987, responsibility for the Ship Cove Historic Reserve passed to the Department of Conservation (New Zealand). The site is a Category 1 listed historic place.  The first explorers  It is believed that the first person to visit T≈çtaranui was the great Polynesian explorer, Kupe, and the area abounds in Kupe place names. The entrance to the sound was a jumping off point between Te Ika-a-MƒÅui / the North Island and Te Waipounamu / the South Island, and the cove was valued by MƒÅori as a place of shelter before crossing the strait and as a place to rest up after the trip. In the late 1770s, people did not live permanently at the cove. They came to fish and gather seasonal foods in the summer.  James Cook's visits  On 15 January 1770, Cook anchored in the cove, and used it as a base to replenish supplies of food, water and wood after his long Pacific voyage. While his ship was overhauled at anchor, Cook made a headquarters on the shore, ordering the planting of vegetable gardens and construction of an enclosure for pigs. Cook would return to the cove a further five times over the course of his first, second and third voyages to the Pacific Ocean, In other parts of New Zealand the contact was brief, but here it was sustained.  After Cook‚Äôs visit  The publication of Cook‚Äôs First Voyage put Ship Cove on the world map, drawing whalers and other explorers to it. By 1810, whalers had called in there. People from Anaho, a bay just to the north, were in close contact with whalers. They helped the visitors, and later, some became Christians and learned to read and write. In May 1820, the Russian ships Vostok and Mirny under the command of Fabien von Bellingshausen sailed into the bay, using a chart based on one made on Cook‚Äôs first voyage, and anchored in the shelter of Motuara Island, where HMS Resolution had anchored in May 1773. He and his men had cautious but friendly contact with the local MƒÅori, trading knives and axes for fish and curios, many of which are now held by museums in St Petersburg and Kazan. Colonel William Wakefield, one of the founders of Wellington, also anchored his ship Tory in the cove in 1839. MƒÅori chiefs from the area signed the Treaty of Waitangi on 4 and 5 May, and 17 June 1840.

He was transferred to the Royal Air Force (RAF) on its creation in 1918 and remained in the RAF during the inter-war years. During the Second World War he served in England and pioneered the bombing technique of using pathfinders to mark targets. He then served in the Far East before becoming a prisoner of war to the Japanese. After the war he returned to Great Britain and the RAF where he reached air rank and twice captained the British Olympic Shooting Team. Early life and education Staton was born in Tutbury, Staffordshire, a village north of Burton upon Trent, and was educated at Guild Street School and the Science School there. First World War Staton began his military service as a private in the Artists Rifles in 1916, a volunteer battalion popular with graduates of Britain's public schools and universities. About two thirds of the 15,000 men who passed through the battalion in World War I became officers somewhere in the British military. Staton passed from the ranks of the Artists Rifles to a cadet's position in the Royal Flying Corps, and was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant (on probation) on 4 May 1917. He was appointed a flying officer with the effective rank of second lieutenant on 21 September 1917. Staton was posted to No. 62 Squadron RFC at the end of flying training early in 1918. On 13 March 1918, twelve Bristol F.2b two-seater fighters of No. 62 Squadron inadvertently engaged at least thirty German fighters south-east of Cambrai, France. Staton was piloting one of the Bristols with Lieutenant Horace E. Merritt as his observer, and he claimed his first two aerial victories. He then flamed a Fokker Dr.I on 21 March, and scored a triple triumph on 26 March to become an ace. He was promoted to temporary lieutenant on 1 April on the same day the Royal Flying Corps was merged with the Royal Naval Air Service to form the Royal Air Force. After scoring two victories in April and a double victory on 3 May, he was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain on 18 May. By the time he was awarded the Military Cross on 22 June 1918 he had 17 claims to his credit. Fifteen of these wins were shared with observer/gunner Lieutenant John Rutherford Gordon making Gordon an ace in his own right. Staton eventually claimed a total of 26 victories, the last one on 24 September 1918. Eight of his last nine victories came with Lieutenant Leslie Mitchell as observer/gunner. In all, Staton had four observers fly with him, and all four became aces, though Merritt and Sergeant William Norman Holmes scored most of their victories with other pilots. His final victory roll comprised (in conjunction with his gunners) two enemy fighters shot down in flames, fourteen more enemy aircraft destroyed, a Pfalz D.XII captured, and an additional nine enemy aircraft driven down 'out of control'. Staton received the Distinguished Flying Cross on 21 September 1918; a Bar in lieu of a second award would follow, after the armistice, on 3 December. Staton was wounded in the leg by an explosive bullet during combat east of Cambrai on 24 September 1918. Recovering from this wound, he sat out the rest of the war. Inter-war career Staton remained in the RAF after the war, being granted a permanent commission as a lieutenant (flying officer) on 1 August 1919. On 12 January 1920, he was posted to No. 20 Squadron, flying the Bristol Fighter on army co-operation duties in the North-West Frontier province of India. On 30 April 1922 he was posted to the RAF Depot as a supernumerary because of illness, but by 16 September 1922 he had recovered enough to be posted to the Marine and Armament Experimental Establishment at RAF Isle of Grain. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 January 1925. In May 1927 Staton was assigned to staff duty at RAF Calshot. That year his name was brought to the notice of the Air Council for his gallantry in saving an airman from drowning after a flying accident. Though nearly overcome by petrol fumes he repeatedly dived under water to extricate the airman. In March 1929 he became an instructor. On 17 January 1931 Staton was posted to No. 205 Squadron based at RAF Seletar in Singapore, flying Supermarine Southampton flying boats. In February 1934 he was posted to the RAF Depot, and later, on 18 June, he was assigned as Adjutant and Qualified Flight Instructor to No. 501 (City of Bristol) Squadron, Auxiliary Air Force, based at RAF Filton, to fly the Westland Wallace. Staton was promoted to squadron leader on 1 February 1935, and on the 15th, he was posted to the Headquarters, Inland Area, Stanmore. On 20 April 1936 he was posted to No. 3 Flying Training School, RAF Grantham, for administrative duties. On 30 May 1938 he was posted to fly Vickers Wellesley bombers with No. 76 Squadron, and on 10 June took command of No. 10 (Bomber) Squadron at RAF Dishforth. His size prompted the new nickname of \\"King Kong\\". On 1 July 1938 he was promoted to wing commander. Second World War Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939. Staton commanded the first British air raid on Berlin on the night of 1/2 October 1939, leading four of No. 10 Squadron's Whitleys to the enemy capital through severe weather to drop propaganda leaflets. On 20 February 1940, Staton was awarded one of the first three Distinguished Service Orders (DSO) granted to the RAF during the war. The DSO is customarily awarded for meritorious or distinguished service in combat. He is known to have flown on numerous raids during this time and been disappointed by the inaccuracy he observed. He attempted to rectify the situation by use of flares for target marking. He also suggested forming a unit dedicated to marking targets; though he would not see it, this suggestion would eventually lead to formation of the Pathfinder Force, later raised as No. 8 Group, Bomber Command. In the same edition of the London Gazette he also received a mention in despatches. On the night of 19/20 March 1940 Staton led an attack on the seaplane base at H√∂rnum, on the island of Sylt, his being the first aircraft to drop bombs on German soil. This was in retaliation for a German air raid on the naval base at Scapa Flow on 16 March in which four sailors and one civilian were killed, and seven wounded. Previous to this both the British and Germans had refrained from bombing land targets. Staton led seven Whitleys from No. 10 Squadron, as part of a force of thirty Whitleys and twenty Hampdens from Bomber Command's No. 4 and No. 5 Groups. Only 29 Whitleys and 17 Hampdens reached the target; three having turned back with mechanical problems, and one failing to locate the target. The aircraft dropped forty , eighty-four , and 1,260 incendiary bombs from heights ranging from to , but mostly from around , over a period of six hours. One Whitley was lost to enemy flak, and two others slightly damaged. Despite claims of severe damage being inflicted, later photo-reconnaissance showed only minor damage to the base and its installations. On 7 June Staton received a bar to his Distinguished Service Order in recognition of his \\"outstanding gallantry and leadership in recent air operations\\", awarded primarily for his part on an attack on an oil depot in Bremen, which he attacked at low level, despite his aircraft having been hit by six shells and badly damaged. In July 1940 he was appointed to command of RAF Leeming, Yorkshire. On 1 December 1940 he was promoted to temporary group captain, and in January 1941 appointed an Air Aide-de-Camp to the King. His next assignment was as Senior Air Staff Officer, Headquarters RAF Far East, in July 1941, being promoted in January 1942 to acting air commodore, and on 11 February was assigned as Senior Air Staff Officer, Westgroup, Java. On 10 March 1942, following the Battle of Java, he was taken prisoner. Staton would spend the remainder of the war as a prisoner of the Japanese, and would undergo torture for refusing to disclose information to them. To punish him for his holding out against questioning, Japanese interrogators removed his back teeth. Staton proved an uncooperative prisoner and was moved sixteen times, spending time in camps in Batavia, Singapore, Japan, Formosa, the Gobi Desert, Mukden, and Siam. On 8 October 1943, while a prisoner, his temporary rank of group captain was made war substantive. Staton was released from captivity in September 1945 after three and a half years as a POW. Later he submitted written evidence to prosecutors at the War Crimes Trial of three Japanese officers from camps in Formosa. Post-war career In November 1945 Staton was appointed Air Officer Commanding, No. 46 (Transport) Group, and on 1 January 1946 was promoted to group captain with the concurrent temporary rank of air commodore. On 1 October 1946 he received his second mention in despatches \\"in recognition of gallant and distinguished service whilst a prisoner of war in Japanese hands\\", and in the 1947 New Year Honours was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. Staton was promoted to air commodore on 1 July 1947, relinquishing his position as Air Aide-de-Camp to the King, and in November was appointed Commandant of the Central Bomber Establishment at RAF Marham. On 5 April 1949 he was appointed Air Officer in Charge of Administration, Headquarters, Technical Training Command, with a promotion to acting air vice marshal, made permanent on 1 July 1950. Staton finally retired from the RAF on 12 November 1952 at his own request, in order to facilitate the promotion of younger officers. William Ernest Staton died on 22 July 1983, just before his 85th birthday.

They had two sons. She died in 1969, and he married Jean Patricia Primrose in 1973. Staton's larger than life personality and physical presence gained him the nickname of \\"Bull\\" during the First World War, as well as a prominent scar on his head, the result of an over-boisterous mess party. While commander of No. 10 Squadron during the Second World War he was nicknamed \\"King Kong\\" by the pilots under his command, and was dubbed \\"Crack'Em Staton\\" by the Daily Express after the attack on Sylt. A keen marksman, Staton regularly competed in both rifle and pistol shooting competitions representing the RAF in shooting matches eleven times, and eventually served as Chairman of the RAF Small Arms Association from 1947 until 1952, and was Captain of the British Olympic Pistol Shooting Team in London in 1948 and Helsinki in 1952. He remained a keen shooter even into retirement, winning the Air Officers SMG Match at Bisley in 1961. Staton was also a skilled yachtsman, serving as Commodore of the Emsworth Sailing Club in Hampshire.

Jonathan the Husky is the mascot of the University of Connecticut. All of UConn's huskies are named Jonathan in honor of Jonathan Trumbull, the last colonial and first state Governor of Connecticut. Traditionally, there are two Jonathan mascots: one is a student in a costume which resembles the university's Athletics logo, and the other is a live husky canine. All but the first real husky mascot, a brown and white dog, had been solid white with one brown eye and one blue eye, until 2013 when UConn officially changed their logo to a black and white Husky. The newest Jonathan is Jonathan XIV, a black and white male introduced January 29, 2014. Jonathan is one of the few university mascots in the nation to have been selected by students via a popular poll (in 1933). The co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega has helped to care for the canine Jonathan since the 1970s. Jonathan I Served as mascot from July 23, 1934‚ÄìFebruary 1935 In 1934 Rhode Island's ram mascot was kidnapped and the story gained interest in bringing a live animal mascot to Connecticut State College. A student poll selected the husky to be the college's mascot and thus, in January 1935, Connecticut State College's first husky mascot arrived at the campus in Storrs. Jonathan's I's grandfather had accompanied Robert Peary on an expedition to the North Pole. The Alumnus had announced a \\"Name the Mascot Contest\\" and \\"Jonathan\\" was the winning entry. Sadly, the day before the name was announced Jonathan I was struck by a vehicle in North Windham. Jonathan I was able to attend a few basketball games at Hawley Armory before his passing. He is buried by the Old Whitney granite step and a plaque commemorates his life. Jonathan II Served as mascot from November 1935 ‚Äì 1947 Jonathan II debuted November 8, 1935 at a pep rally prior to the annual football rivalry game against Rhode Island. Jonathan II was an Eskimo Husky, and cousin to the original Jonathan. Jonathan made his presence felt in September 1936. He scared Brown University's live bear mascot severely and chased the bear up a tree. Jonathan II made Brown's bear so timid, it refused to leave the tree. The bear had to be rescued from the tree by Providence police and fire fighters. Jonathan III Served as mascot from 1947‚àí1949 Jonathan III made his debut November 8, 1947, against Rhode Island in football. Jonathan III is best known for chasing Yale's bulldog mascot around the Yale Bowl. Other sources claim that Handsome Dan VI growled when introduced to Jonathan III, but turned and fled when Jonathan stepped closer. Before arriving in Storrs, Jonathan traveled to Antarctica to assist Admiral Richard E. Byrd with Operation Highjump during the winter of 1946 to 1947. Bob Steiner, considered the most famous of husky trainers, would break an area of ice on campus's Mirror Lake for Jonathan to enjoy a cool swim in. He was also dog-napped prior to a football game. Jonathan IV Served as mascot from 1949‚Äì1959 Jonathan IV arrived on campus in 1949. He was a Siberian-Eskimo-Samoyed mix with greyish markings. His first football game was against Yale, and he bit their bulldog mascot on the nose. In 1951, Jonathan IV traveled to Madison Square Garden, NYC in to accompany the men's basketball team in their first NCAA tournament appearance. While there he received a standing ovation after abruptly running onto the court. Jonathan IV was not a big fan of opposing basketball players and was known to growl when points were scored against UConn. Jonathan V Served as mascot from April 1959 ‚Äì 1963 Jonathan V made his appearance as the UConn mascot in 1959. However, he was not able to handle the noise and commotion of large crowds. This made appearances at football games unpleasant for Jonathan V, where he would roll onto his back and moan at the loud noises. News reports refer to Jonathan V as \\"shell shocked\\". Jonathan V was retired in 1963. UConn introduced a man in a husky costume mascot to serve as an interim mascot known as \\"Homer the Husky\\". Pictures from the period show human mascot outfits have vastly changed for UConn since this time. Jonathan VI Served as mascot from 1963-1964 Just two months after being introduced to campus, Jonathan VI died after being hit by a car. Jonathan VII Served as mascot from 1964‚Äì1977 In March 1965, Jonathan VII came to campus as a gift from the student body of the University of Alaska. The University of Alaska wanted to repay UConn for their assistance following a devastating earthquake in Alaska. The beautiful all white husky almost became the last animal mascot for UConn. He wore a dog tag labeled \\"Number One,\\" serving as a symbol for the Town Clerk's annual dog registration campaign. 1970, the Student Senate voted to sell the mascot because the dog \\"represented the establishment.\\" UConn was a hotbed of anti- Vietnam fervor, like most college campuses of the time. 2,500 students petitioned support for Jonathan, which successfully saved the mascot by overriding the Student Senate. Jonathan VII was turned over to Alpha Phi Omega, the service fraternity, for handling. Before retiring, Jonathan VII's final football game was in 1977. As a reward for his life-long, model service to UConn, Jonathan VII was honored with the title \\"Mascot Emeritus.\\" He died at the age of 14 and a half and is buried near Jonathan I at the Old Whitney Granite Step. Jonathan VIII Served as mascot from 1977‚Äì1991 As Jonathan VII was being retired the University was introducing Jonathan VIII. Finally, in 1989, University trustees officially recognized the Husky dog as the official mascot of UConn athletics. Jonathan VIII lived on the farm of Richard Rogers, a retired army officer living in Willington. He was said to shy away from men but loved the company of women. Jonathan VIII died of cancer in May 1991. Jonathan IX or Jonathan X Served as mascot from July 1991 ‚Äì 1995 Jonathan IX arrived on campus in July 1991, and began his stay with Alpha Phi Omega. However, before his debut to the student body, the fraternity stated the husky was not Jonathan IX but actually Jonathan X. Alpha Phi Omega's theory was that two huskies served as Jonathan VIII and the mascot's name needed to reflect this. There are no public records to dispute or verify this claim but it is the claim given by the University in publications and on tours.{{=\\"DC\\"> Another theory on campus states that students of Clubhouse 29 found a stray pup on the streets and took him in. After being informed it was Jonathan IX they refused to give the pup back to Alpha Phi Omega. The fraternity mobilized and was able to find another husky in time, Jonathan X. Even though it is unclear what the truth is surrounding Jonathan X, he served the university dutifully. Jonathan X is notable for having one blue eye and one brown eye, known as Heterochromia iridum. Tragically Jonathan X was struck by a vehicle and died in 1995. Jonathan XI Served as mascot from 1995‚Äì2001 Jonathan XI arrived with about as much momentum a husky pup can arrive on campus. He made his debut 2 weeks after the unveiling of the majestic husky dog statue, and a month after the UConn Women's basketball team won its first NCAA National Championship. Jonathan XI retired in 2001 but continued to represent UConn in a positive manner by participating in an animal therapy program. Jonathan XII Served as mascot from 2001‚ÄìSpring 2005 Jonathan XII made his debut in 2001. He continued the UConn tradition of being a majestically brilliant all white husky that was cared for by Alpha Phi Omega. Jonathan XII was unable to deal with large crowds, and seemed stressed with being surrounded by large crowds. This became an issue because of UConn growing athletic prowess at the time. During Jonathan XII's tenure, UConn football became a Division I-A football team that played at a 40,000 seat stadium. UConn men's basketball won their second National Championship, and UConn Women's basketball won 3 more National Championships (2001, 2003, and 2004). All of the heightened interest caused Jonathan XII distress, so he was retired. Jonathan XIII Served as mascot from March 9, 2008 ‚Äì January 28, 2014 Jonathan XIII was a rambunctious pup born in Hartstown PA. After being selected to carry on the tradition of the UConn Husky, he received training at Connecticut K-9 and Behavioral Services in Watertown, CT. Jonathan XIII made his debut March 9, 2008 and helped guide the men to victory over Cincinnati. The delay in bringing in a new husky mascot was due to Alpha Phi Omega revamping their policies of caring for Jonathan. Further, a professional handler was brought in to work with Jonathan full-time. Other policies included a vetting process to show that Jonathan could handle large crowds and loud noise. Jonathan XIV Served as mascot from January 29, 2014‚Äìpresent Jonathan XIV was born October 5, 2013. He has the more traditional black and white coat, with blue eyes, to reflect UConn's recent change in their mascot logo. Jonathan XIII and XIV made joint appearances for several months before the transition was completed.Jonathan (costume version) standing under a blow- up version of a husky.

MacKaye (rhymes with sky), Massachusetts forester and co-founder of The Wilderness Society, was the man whose vision inspired what is today the Appalachian Trail. In the south, he had selected a more westerly route, along the western crest of the Blue Ridge, roughly that followed today by the BMT.

General Christophe Juchault de Lamorici√®re, upon becoming commander- in-chief of the restive colony for a short period, created the affaires arabes, the Arab affairs department, and put Daumas in charge of the province of Oran. When Thomas Robert Bugeaud became governor general of Algeria in 1840, he reinstated the bureaux arabes, the main instrument to administer cooperative tribes during the insurgency, on 17 August 1841. The same day Daumas was named the head of the colony's entire Arab affairs program. One of his explicit tasks was to gather intelligence about potential unrest.Jacques Fr√©meaux, Les Bureaux arabes dans l‚ÄôAlg√©rie de la conqu√™te (Paris: Deno√´l 1993), p. 287. In April 1850 he became director of Algerian affairs in the Ministry of War in Paris. On 14 January 1853 he was promoted to divisional general. On 12 August 1857 he was named a Senator. Several of Daumas' works were translated into English in the 19th century. His book on horses was particularly appreciated among contemporaries.R.L.

It was first isolated and reproduced in 2008 from cells of the freshwater hydroid Hydra. Only around 60 amino acids long, the protein is unique both in amino acid sequence and tertiary structure, prompting its classification in a new family of proteins, the macins. The protein's unusual structure is most likely a reason for the compound's potent antimicrobial qualities. Antimicrobial tests determined that the protein has an antibacterial effect against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This potent antibacterial activity extended to known multi-resistant strains of pathogenic bacteria, such as those of Klebsiella oxytoca. Functionally, the protein causes bacterial cells to clump together and aggregate, changing the morphology of the bacterial aggregations it creates. This results in a disruption of the structure of the bacterial membrane. Hydramacin-1 was first isolated from epithelial cells of the cnidarian Hydra, a small (almost- microscopic) freshwater animal related to corals, sea anemones and jellyfish. Like other members of the Phylum Cnidaria, Hydra possesses specialized defensive epithelial cells called cnidocytes that shoot toxic barbs into organisms they come in physical contact with. German researchers managed to isolate the gene that coded for the production of the protein from the Hydra genome in 2008. The gene was transferred and cloned in a plasmid (Pet32a) which was inserted in the bacteria Escherichia coli, a standard method of replicating a protein isolated from a much larger organism. The three- dimensional structure of the resulting protein was then determined by NMR spectroscopy and is now published online by the Protein Data Bank. Hydramacin-1 is a single-chain protein composed of sixty amino acids. It is a unique combination of amino acids on the surface of the molecule that gives the protein its potent antimicrobial qualities. This specialized part of the protein tertiary structure, a positively charged belt in between two hydrophobic (and ionically inert) regions, has been suggested as the trigger for bacterial aggregation influence by the protein. Hydramacin-1 is different from any other antibacterial currently known, except for two proteins found in leeches. The researchers propose placing hydramacin-1 and the proteins from the leech in a newly designated protein family called the macins. The proteins closest in structure to the macins are a superfamily of proteins derived from scorpion venom, dubbed the scorpion oxins.

He was born in London to a shoe shop manager, and became interested in nature thanks to holidays spent with his grandfather, a gamekeeper, and his uncle, a pharmacist. He was educated at William Ellis School before being accepted into University College London to study botany and zoology. After graduating he went to the College of the Pharmaceutical Society and studied pharmacy, graduating in 1935. He became a demonstrator at the college under J H Burn and at his urging took further degrees in medicine and physiology. The start of World War II saw the College evacuated, leaving Goodwin to find a new job. He started work at the Wellcome Bureau of Scientific Research but was called up for military service with the Royal Tank Regiment soon afterwards. After only a few days of training he was returned to Wellcome to work on tropical diseases, something considered 'vital war work' which excused him from military service. One of the important problems he was dealing with at the time was trying to find a way of preventing troops being infected with leishmaniasis, which was affecting large numbers of troops in Sicily at the time. The standard way of calculating the dosage of drug to give a person was the 'chemotherapeutic index', an index between the minimum dosage to cure an infection and the point at which the drug would kill the patient. Goodwin's attempt at refining the index by testing the drugs on European hamsters failed because they were already resistant to Leishmaniasis; instead he got a scientist in Jerusalem to send him some Syrian hamsters to test the drugs on. The research showed that Pentostam was the least toxic and most effective drug available to treat the disease, and it was issued to troops within a year. Goodwin later claimed that the Syrian hamsters used as pets in the United Kingdom were for the most part descended from the colony he had bred, and credited himself with introducing the use of hamsters as pets. He continued working at the Wellcome Bureau of Scientific Research until 1958, when he became director of the Wellcome Laboratories of Tropical Medicine. In 1964 he became head of the Nuffield Laboratories for Comparative Medicine, staying there until 1980. During this time he conducted research into anticoagulants, trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) and arteriosclerosis. In 1976 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in the 1977 New Year Honours was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) \\"for services to the study of tropical diseases\\".

Abandoned after the war, today North Field is a tourist attraction. Along with several adjacent beaches on which Allied forces landed during the Battle of Tinian, the airfield is the major component of the National Historic Landmark District Tinian Landing Beaches, Ushi Point Field, Tinian Island. North Field was one of several bases for Twentieth Air Force Boeing B-29 Superfortress operations against the Japanese Home Islands in 1944‚Äì45. North Field contributed aircraft to the 1945 campaign to burn out Japanese cities with incendiary bombs, including the 9 March 1945 bombing of Tokyo which still stands as the most destructive air raid ever. North Field was the base for the 313th Bombardment Wing which carried out Operation Starvation, the dropping of naval mines in the harbors and sea lanes used by Japan. North Field was also the base for the 509th Composite Group which flew the atomic bombing raids on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. The incendiary campaign (which destroyed 40% of the targeted cities), the aerial mining campaign (which starved Japan of essential food imports) and the two atomic attacks have all been argued as major factors in the surrender of Japan. History =Ushi Point Airfield= Tinian, with its sister islands of the Marianas, had passed through Spanish and German hands before becoming a Protectorate of Japan following World War I. Under Japanese administration, Tinian was largely a sugar plantation. In 1939, large-scale military construction began on Tinian by the Japanese Military. 1,200 prisoners were sent to the island from Japan for the construction of airfields as part of the defense of the Mariana Islands. By 1944, the island had three military airfields with a fourth under construction. What would become North Field was a Japanese airstrip 4,380' in length, known as Ushi Point Airfield and was home to the Nakajima C6N-1 reconnaissance aircraft of the 121st Kokutai Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS). Until the spring of 1944, the base remained largely out of major action. Nakajima C6N-1 reconnaissance aircraft of the 121st Kokutai after being captured on Tinian, July 1944 By mid-1944, the Americans had advanced inside the Japanese ring of defense in the Pacific Theater. Tinian, located approximately 1,500 miles from mainland Japan, was well-suited for the United States Army Air Forces to establish a large staging area from which to conduct long-range strategic offensive air operations over the Japanese Home Islands with the new B-29 Superfortress. During early 1944, the B-29 heavy bombers were operating ineffectively from bases in China. Stationing the Superfortresses in the Marianas brought Japan within their effective range of operation, as well as provided the Twentieth Air Force with reliable means of support from the western ports of the United States. The Ushi Point Airfield and its assigned aircrews did their part to repel American advances in the Marianas Islands but following the fall of Guam and Saipan to American forces in July 1944 it became clear that Tinian would be attacked next. Assaulted on July 24, 1944 by United States Marines from Saipan, which had just been taken the previous month, the airfield was almost totally destroyed by the American naval bombardment and air attack prior to the assault by the 4th Marine Division. The Japanese were taken by surprise, with several aircraft being captured relatively intact inside a hangar. The offensive was regarded as one of the best-executed amphibious operations of the war. Ushi Point airfield fell to US forces on July 26 and was almost immediately handed over to the care of US Navy Construction Battalions, or Seabees. 1,500 Seabees landed with the initial forces on Tinian in July 1944 and immediately set to work repairing the damaged Japanese Ushi Point Airfield, even before the fighting had ended. =North Field construction= US Navy Seabee view USAAF B-29 Superfortresses arriving at uncompleted North Field, Tinian, 1944 Once under American control, a massive construction project was begun on the north end of Tinian. Operating for over 45 days and nights, often while under fire, the Seabees initially repaired and extended the existing 4,380 ft runway and then added an additional two runways, each 8,000 ft long and lying in an east-west direction. Nearly the entire northern end of the island was occupied by runways, the airfield area, and the various support facilities and containment areas. The Ushi Point Airfield was expanded with three 8000' runways involving the movement of nearly 1,000,000 cubic yards of earth and coral and the accumulation of some 900,000 truck miles. A fourth runway was constructed in May 1945 and hardstands built for 265 B-29 bombers. The four parallel 8,000 ft runways are oriented nearly East-West. Upon completion, North Field was the largest airfield in the world. =313th Bombardment Wing= North Field in 1945, just prior to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the 509th Composite Group North Field came under the command of Twentieth Air Force XXI Bomber Command, with the 313th Bombardment Wing being the host unit at the expansive station in December 1944. Its operational groups were: * 6th Bombardment Group (Circle R) * 9th Bombardment Group (Circle X) * 504th Bombardment Group (Circle E) * 505th Bombardment Group (Circle W) * 5th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron (Very Long Range) The four runways at North Field were lettered \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\" and \\"D\\" from north to south. The 6th Group was parked on the south-side of Runway D, then going north the 9th Group was parked between C and D. The 504th between C and B, and the 505th on the north side of runway A. In addition, the B-29s were assigned specific hardstands for each aircraft so the ground crew could store spares and other items for each aircraft on them. The groups used the runway to the north side of their parking area hardstands, but this was not fast and firm, because if there was an accident and the runway was closed, the aircraft shifted to another runway. Tinian, Mariana Islands, 1945 after airfield construction, looking north to south. The massive North Field, 313th Bombardment Wing in front, West Field, 58th Bombardment Wing, in background. The 313th BW consisted of 4 B-29 Superfortress Bombardment Groups, later adding the 509th Composite Group, which conducted the Atomic Bomb Attacks against Japan in August 1945. Once in place, the groups of the 313th began flying missions, initially against Iwo Jima, the Truk Islands, and other Japanese held areas. Later, they flew low-level night incendiary raids on area targets in Japan; participated in mining operations in the Shimonoseki Strait, and contributed to the blockade of the Japanese Empire by mining harbors in Japan and Korea. In April 1945 the 313th assisted the invasion of Okinawa by bombing Japanese airfields used by kamikaze pilots. A fifth group, the 509th Composite Group, was assigned to the wing in May 1945 from Wendover AAF, Utah. The 509th, although assigned to the 313th Bomb Wing, was operationally controlled by Headquarters, Twentieth Air Force. The 509th was given a base area near the airfield on the north tip of the island, several miles from the main installations in the center part of the island where the other groups were assigned. The 509th aircraft almost always used runway \\"A\\" and the aircraft were parked away from the other groups on the north side of the runway. Also unlike the other groups in the wing, the 509th used a wide variety of tail codes from various XXI Bomber Command groups, instead of using its own, so that the group's planes could not be identified by the Japanese. The 509th was also self-contained, and drew little in resources from the 313th Wing or its other groups. In early August, the mission of the 509th was revealed when the group flew the atomic bomb missions over the enemy cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In November, the 509th was relieved from assignment to the 313th Bomb Wing and was reassigned to Roswell AAF, New Mexico. After the Japanese surrender in August, 313th Bomb Wing units dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners of war and participated in show-of-force flights over Japan. The units of the 313th Bombardment Wing were either reassigned or inactivated within a few months after the end of the Pacific War. The last USAAF unit, the 505th Bombardment Group, left North Field on June 30, 1946, ending its use as an operational airfield. The 313th Bombardment Wing moved to Clark Field, Philippines on 1 February 1946. The base was placed in a standby status until being closed on 30 March 1947. North Field today North Field, 27 August 2008 Having no real purpose or any use after 1947, North Field was soon officially abandoned by the USAAF. Immediately after the war, the locals on the island did not have to farm or do work of any kind for the first two years after the airfield was abandoned because the withdrawing American military forces left entire stocks of almost everything ranging from food, brand-new military uniforms and even ice-cream makers (these were simply left behind in North Field's many warehouses). Any of the locals who wanted to get a vehicle could just do so by heading to the airfield and drive it until it fell apart or could not be repaired anymore before getting another one. Some abandoned B-29 aircraft wrecks were also left behind at the airfield after the war ended, but these were eventually melted down for scrap metal in the 1950s. The airfield has been steadily reclaimed by the dense tropical jungle on the island, being thoroughly abandoned and heavily overgrown. It is easily accessible by travelling just a few miles north of San Jose on the main north- south road, which is known as \\"Broadway\\". The runways (constructed out of crushed coral) are grayish-looking and quite weathered, but Runway Able and Runway Baker and some of the taxiways remain usable for driving on in an ordinary car, with considerable weed growth on the surface. Other than the two worn-out runways, the taxiways, the empty remnants of the former Japanese- built administration buildings and the preserved loading/storage pits where the atomic bombs were loaded on the bomber aircraft, there is not much left of the old airfield. The forest has grown up to the edges of the runways and taxiways. The surviving airfield administration buildings, along with the airfield itself and the nearby landing beaches of White One and White Two, were designated a National Historic Landmark District for their role in the war. In 2003 Runway Able was cleared/grubbed and the flight path was brought up to current FAA requirements by the Navy Seabees of NMCB 28 in preparation for Exercise Tandem Thrust, a joint exercise with the US Marine Corps, Navy Seabees and U.S. Army 25th Infantry Division. The Seabees successfully defended the runway and base from the Army's attack and then assisted the Army in creating the defenses against the Marines. Aircraft used in the attack were CH-47 and CH-53 helicopters. Runway Baker and adjoining taxiways were cleared for ease of access. In addition, the Seabees donated additional time and help with several community projects. The secondary benefit of the clear and grub effort was the ability of the runway to be used by the Guam Air National Guard for training. In 2013, Baker runway was partially refurbished by the United States Marine Corps for Exercise Forager Fury II. The exercise was a demonstration of the Marine Wing Support Squadron 171's ability to displace rapidly and generate significant combat power in an expeditionary environment. A Marine Corps KC-130J Super Hercules landed on the runway 5 December 2013, the second aircraft to use North Field since 1947.KC-130 Lands on Tinian's Baker Runway During Forager Fury II In the case of a surprise Chinese ballistic missile attack on US air bases in Japan and South Korea, aircraft could be rapidly dispersed on WWII Pacific airfields, including Tinian.https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/06/05/u-s-reopening-world-war-ii-bases- in-pacific/http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/missile-strikes-us-bases- asia-chinas-real-threat-america-21714?page=2 Image:Runway Able, North Field (Tinian), 27 August 2008.jpgRunway Able Image:No. 1 Atomic Bomb loading pit, North Field (Tinian), 27 August 2008.jpgNo. 1 Atomic Bomb (Little Boy) loading pit See also * West Field (Tinian) * USAAF in the Central Pacific * List of United States National Historic Landmarks in United States commonwealths and territories, associated states, and foreign states * National Register of Historic Places listings in the Northern Mariana Islands References * Maurer, Maurer (1983).

Armenian Weekly (originally Hairenik Weekly) is an English Armenian publication published by Hairenik Association, Inc. in Watertown, Massachusetts in the United States. It is the sister publication to the Armenian language weekly Hairenik. It was started as Hairenik Weekly in 1934 and its name was changed to Armenian Weekly, the name under which it is still published, in 1969. Armenian Weekly also runs an online publication. Hairenik Weekly (19341969) In June 1932, the Armenian- language Hairenik had started a column in English to address the needs of English-speaking Armenians. The response was so positive that by March 1934 the Hairenik Weekly was established entirely in English and began publication, mostly through the efforts of young volunteer contributors. In June 1934 Hairenik Weekly acquired a full-time editor, James Mandalian, and an assistant editor, Queenie Pambookjian. Notably, there were translations of short stories by such prominent Armenian writers as Avetis Aharonian and Hamasdegh and the poems of Gostan Zarian. Moreover, the very stories that initially brought William Saroyan national recognition by the American public were first published in the Hairenik Weekly (under the pseudonym \\"Sirak Goryan\\"). Armenian Weekly (1969Present) Today, along with news of general interest to the Armenian-American community, the Armenian Weekly publishes editorials, political analyses, regular columns, short stories, and poems. The newspaper, while reflecting the Armenian Revolutionary Federation and Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA), is also open to a wide variety of views and opinions in which the pros and cons of issues can be discussed openly and honestly. Youth activities are still reported in each issue, upcoming events are announced in the calendar and cultural activities are reported through music, dance and movie reviews. Although the Armenian Weekly's headquarters are located in Watertown, Massachusetts, subscribers hail from as near as Boston and as far as Buenos Aires and beyond.

The organization's members include over 230 advertisers, advertising agencies, media organizations, and suppliers to the advertising sector. Some of the activities that the organization engages in are: *Administering the Canadian Code of Advertising Standards, which sets the criteria for acceptable advertising and forms the basis for the review and adjudication of consumer and trade complaints. *Administering a consumer complaints process about advertisements currently running in Canadian media. *Providing pre-clearance for advertising in five regulated categories: children's, food and non-alcoholic beverages, alcoholic beverages, consumer drugs, and cosmetics.  History  The Canadian advertising industry founded the Canadian Advertising Advisory Board (later renamed Ad Standards) in 1957 as a means to encourage ethical advertising practices. The Canadian Code of Advertising Standards (Code) was published in 1963. The CAAB would adopt a bilingual name in 1967: the Canadian Advertising Advisory Board/Bureau consultatif de la publicit√© au Canada. That same year, as a means to adjudicate consumers' complaints, the Advertising Standards Council/le Conseil des normes de la publict√© (ASC/CNP) was created. The reviewing of broadcast advertising to children by the CAAB began in 1972, and was initiated at the request of CAB and CRTC. Two years later, the British Columbia and Alberta Advertising Standards Councils were formed. 1976 saw the launch of the Trade Dispute Procedure. The Canadian Advertising Foundation/La foundation canadienne de la publicit√© (CAF/FCP) was created in 1982 as a result of the merger of the CAAB with ASC/CNP. In 1994, The Color of Your Money was produced by CAF's Race Relations Advisory Council on Advertising. The initial Ad Complaints Report, including case reports, was published in 1997; that same year, the CAF would be renamed to Advertising Standards Canada/Les normes canadiennes de la publicit√©. 1999 saw the launch of the \\"You respond to advertising ‚Äì we respond to you\\" public awareness campaign. A second public awareness campaign - \\"We stand up for advertising standards\\" - would commence in 2001. In 2003, following a careful Task Force review of the Code, major Code revisions were published. Two years later, in 2005, comparative advertising and comparative research guidelines were published. Multiple public awareness campaigns continued to be launched throughout the rest of the decade and into the 2010s: \\"Truth\\" (2006), \\"Dressing it up doesn't make it true\\" (2011), and \\"Creativity is subjective. The truth isn't\\" (2015). On August 1, 2017, the organization announced the launch of a refreshed corporate identity. The group's name is now Ad Standards/Normes de la publicit√©.

In 1910, her family's home was destroyed in the Aomori City fire. Ten years later they were bankrupt, and in 1923 she, along with her mother and younger sister, went to Tokyo. There, she was admitted to the piano department of a music school. Later, her disposition towards singing was discovered and she was admitted to the vocal department. With the aim of becoming an opera singer, she made an extensive study of classical music. However, due to her family's poverty, she was forced to leave school for a year and worked as a nude model. Eventually, she returned to the music academy, and graduated top of her class in 1929. She became a classical singer. However, she soon began to sing popular songs because the salary of a classical music performer was very low. Her 1937 song became a hit. In 1938, she also released . In Taiwan, the song was later given the alternative title \\"Han Yu Qu\\" (ÂØíÈõ®Êõ≤). In 1939, she recorded the song as an insert song of the movie \\"Tokyo no Josei\\", in which Setsuko Hara played the main role. However, the song was banned by Japanese authorities. Awaya had a daughter outside marriage. In her old age, she criticized enka. She also criticized Hideki Saijo and Seiko Matsuda because Saijo enjoyed dancing and Matsuda sang songs without feeling. She said that songs without pain, distress and effort were frauds. Kenichi Mikawa respected her. In 1996, Awaya gave Mikawa her song \\"Rainy Blues\\" at her final live performance. She was elected an honorary citizen by her hometown Aomori City in 1998 and died in 1999. In 2007, Hideaki Tokunaga covered Awaya's song \\"Farewell Blues\\" at a concert.

This area was part of the Cherokee Strip Outlet which was opened for settlement on September 16, 1893. It is located in modern-day Grant County, between Medford and Deer Creek. It was located seven miles east and one-half mile south of Medford. It was located along the Gulf Railroad (later the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe) that connected the towns of Manchester, Wakita, Medford, and Deer Creek. The Numa Post Office was established on April 20, 1898. Numa had amenities such as a community hall, granary, weigh station, and a rail spur. Many members of the settler community made the run from Caldwell, Kansas and continued their relationships (economic and familial) with contacts from that entry point. Much of the initial amenities were abandoned as members of the community moved to more favorable living locations such as Medford, Ponca City, and Enid. The post office officially closed in 1943. The last post master was Mrs. Laura (Fredrick) Fitzgerald Rogers, who along with her first husband, Earl Jesse Fitzgerald, ran a general store in Numa for many years. The Santa Fe RailRoad ceased operation in 1972. The tracks have since been removed and the railroad right- of-way has been abandoned. The grain elevator operated by Fuquay Grain was the last surviving business left from the original town. Much of the history of Numa was explained to the author by his father (oral in 1994 upon the death of Juanita Feagan/Cote/Gates). During the visit to Numa, all that remained of Numa was a sign along the side of the road, debris and overgrown bushes where the community hall had once existed, and the derelict (but perhaps still functional) granary that was next to the rail spur. Present In 2001, most of the remnants had been cleared and a new granary had been established. The current grain elevator is operated by the W.B. Johnston Grain Company, Johnston Enterprises, Inc., of Enid, Oklahoma. Johnston's build a new office and bins across the road east from the site of the original elevator to accommodate the larger trucks used to move grain today. On the evening of April 30, 2012, there was an outbreak of severe thunderstorms that spawned several tornadoes. The bins for the W.B. Johnston elevator were destroyed. In July 2013, a wood-framed house as well as numerous outbuildings were moved to Numa from a nearby farm. This is the first permanent building in Numa in decades. A family moved in.

It is the oldest surviving structure of its type in Western Europe, and it is a Grade I listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument. Only three other glass cones survive in the United Kingdom; at Lemington, Wordsley and Alloa. The glassworks cone was part of the Catcliffe glassworks, which was established in 1740 by William Fenney. Fenney had previously been the manager of the glassworks at Bolsterstone that was owned by his mother-in-law. The site at Catcliffe was chosen in part because the terms of her will prevented him from setting up a glassworks within of the works at Bolsterstone and Catcliffe is away. The glassworks closed c.1887, but was reopened briefly in 1900. The brick cone has archways around the base to allow maximum air entry. It is approximately high. Although glassmaking is an ancient process, it was carried out on a small scale until the development of industrialised methods in Europe allowed it to be mass- produced. The fusion of silica and sodium oxide in a furnace was usually achieved by the burning of wood; but coal was often used instead in Britain, which prompted the development of the glass cone. Glass cones consisted of a large central furnace, a flue to carry waste gas to the top of the structure and away, smaller furnaces around the walls to ensure the finished products stayed warm, and a circular platform on which workers stood while making their glassware. Although invented earlier, they became commonplace in the early 19th century; but further innovations in the glassmaking industry made the float glass production method more efficient and allowed manufacture to be based in fewer but larger works. Most cones were knocked down after they fell out of use, and by the mid-1970s only four survived: the Alloa cone (the only example in Scotland), Catcliffe Glass Cone, Lemington Glass Cone in Tyne and Wear, and Red House Cone in Wordsley, West Midlands. In the First World War the site was used as a prisoner-of-war camp and, as a canteen during the 1926 United Kingdom general strike. The cone was threatened with demolition in the 1960s so the foundations of the other buildings that comprised the glassworks were excavated in 1962. In 1968 the cone received Grade I listing. Access to the site was closed in 2006 as bricks were falling from the top of the structure. Restoration work was undertaken in 2014.

Anton von Rosas (23 December 1791 - 31 May 1855) was an Austrian ophthalmologist born in P√©cs, Hungary. He studied medicine at the Universities of Pest and Vienna, earning his doctorate in 1814. He later became an assistant to Georg Joseph Beer (1763-1821) at the University Eye Clinic in Vienna, and from 1819 to 1821 was director of the ophthalmology clinic at the University of Padua. In 1821 he returned to Vienna as successor to the late Dr. Beer. From 1821 to 1853 he was professor of ophthalmology and director of the eye clinic at the University of Vienna. He is credited with making several improvements at the clinic, including establishment of a year-round ambulatory clinic.

The band is credited for starting the pop rock revival in FR Yugoslavia of the 1990s which produced other notable acts like Oru≈æjem Protivu Otmiƒçara, Kristali and Veliki Prezir.Interview with Eva Braun, X ZABAVA, August 1998  History  = Formation, debut releases (1989-1993) = In 1989 Goran Vasoviƒá and Petar Dolinka made some discussions about forming a band. In Spring 1990, the core of the band was formed by the former two and Milan Glava≈°ki. The agreement took place in a rented apartment in Novi Sad's Mi≈°e Dimitrijeviƒáa street. The first songs from this period were \\"Kuƒáa lutaka\\", \\"Kao da znam\\", \\"Sva tvoja ƒáutanja\\" and \\"Dan pobede\\". In September, Ljubomir Rajiƒá, after coming back from the army, joined the band as the fourth member. The name of the band, Eva Braun, was proposed by Vasoviƒá after viewing a biographical film about Adolf Hitler. The name was both unusual and provocative, which was agreeable to the other members. The first rehearsals took place in November, and the first concert was held in the end of 1991 in a local \\"DB Klub\\" in Beƒçej. The band played both their own songs as well as cover versions of The Beatles, Little Richard, The Byrds, Idoli songs. Most of the year 1991 was spent in composing the music that would appear on the debut album. The debut album Prislu≈°kivanja (Eavesdroppings) was recorded between February and April 1992 in the \\"Do Re Mi\\" studio in Bukovac near Novi Sad. The studio owner and album producer was Predrag Pejiƒá Peƒëa, a friend of the band members since their beginnings. The recording lasted for about 130 hours on the 8 channel Magnetophon, using rhythm machine instead of drums. At the time of the recording, the band still haven't got a label. But one of the guests of the \\"Do Re Mi\\" studio was Miƒáa Jak≈°iƒá, owner of the Carlo Records for which Belgrade's D≈æa ili Bu had just signed. After some negotiations, the agreement was made with him to release the album. So, on October 5, 1992 the debut album Prislu≈°kivanja was released. Only 500 copies of vinyl LPs were printed. Although the marketing campaign was rather chaotic and unprepared, the album was noticed by some influential people of the music industry, like Gordan Paunoviƒá, Momƒçilo Rajin, Petar Janjatoviƒá, Bojan ≈Ωikiƒá, Neboj≈°a Pajkiƒá, Tomislav Grujiƒá and Dinko Tucakoviƒá, who was the art director of the Museum of Yugoslav Film Archive. Radio B92 also played a great role in promoting Prislu≈°kivanja. The rest of 1992 the band spent on promoting the album on the medias who were interested in pop and rock music. Eva Braun had no music videos in this period, so TV appearances were only in the form of interviews and lip-synch performances. Few songs from Prislu≈°kivanja became minor hits such as \\"Veƒá viƒëeno\\", \\"Ponekad\\", \\"Sva tvoja ƒáutanja\\", \\"Jagodna Polja\\" and \\"Kuƒáa lutaka\\". In January 1993, Miƒáa Jak≈°iƒá organized a tour called \\"Dobri bendovi Vojvodine\\" (Good Bands of Vojvodina) as a response to then heavily promoted tour \\"Brzi bendovi Srbije\\" (Fast Bands of Serbia). Few bands of very different music styles took part and, besides Eva Braun, those were Generacija Bez Buduƒánosti, 16x8x23, Gluve Kuƒçke, Instant Karma, Oru≈æjem Protivu Otmiƒçara and others. Till the end of February, the tour had included all the major cities of Vojvodina, and the last concert was held in Belgrade's KST. The bands who took part in the tour also recorded a cover of The Clash' song London Calling, under the title \\"Vojvodina zove\\" (Vojvodina Calling), but the song was never released. Having finished the \\"Dobri Bendovi Vojvodine\\" tour, the band started working on the unplugged concert which was announced for the mid-Spring 1993. With a help of Dinko Tucakoviƒá, the concert was held on April 16, 1993 in the Hall of the Yugoslav Film Archive. The crowd of 200 people enjoyed what is considered the best concert of the band's early career. The concert lasted for two and a half hours, with three encores. The band played own songs as well as some covers. The guests were Sabljar of D≈æa ili Bu and violinist Sa≈°a ≈†tukelja. The whole performance was recorded and, about a month later, released as a live album Unplugged 16.04.1993.. The album is considered today a rarity, as it was released only in 200 copies on audio cassettes. = Nationwide success, breakup (1993-1996) = Until the end of the summer, Prislu≈°kivanja was sold out, and Unplugged was heavily praised. Eva Braun slowly came to popularity. But, the things were not going easy for the band. In Autumn 1993, Carlo Records was closed. Gordan Paunoviƒá, the music editor of radio B92 approached the band and offered them to take part in the compilation album Radio Utopia,Various - Radio Utopia (B92: 1989-1994) at Discogs which was to be released for the occasion of the fifth anniversary of B92. The band chose to do a cover of The Velvet Underground's \\"Stephanie Says\\". The song was named \\"Aljaska\\" (Alaska), and became one of Eva Braun's greatest hits so far. After this success, the band signed for the new formed B92 record label. During the same year, they recorded two songs to the lyrics of the poet Ljubivoje R≈°umoviƒá for the children TV show \\"Fore i fazoni\\" of TV Novi Sad, and soundtrack for the play Caligula by Albert Camus directed by Ana Miljaniƒá. In the meantime, the band was working on their second studio album. Recording the album Pop Music was very slow and difficult. It started in September 1994 in the \\"Do Re Mi\\" studio, which was now relocated to Novi Sad, and was going very slowly. The reasons were numerous: often power cuts, bad and old equipment, etc. The relations within the band were also not as harmonic any more. During the ten months of the recordings, the band members spent only four days together in the studio. The authorship of the album was shared between Vasoviƒá, Glava≈°ki, Dolinka, and, for the first time, Ljubomir Rajiƒá. The recording was finished in July 1995, and the album was released on December 14, 1995. The album was promoted in Belgrade's \\"Plato\\" club, and one of the guests was Vlada Divljan of Idoli who had just come back from Australia where he lived for years. In February 1996 Eva Braun and Vlada Divljan recorded a cover version of \\"Hajde, sanjaj me sanjaj\\", originally released on the Idoli album Odbrana i poslednji dani. The music video for this song was directed by Dinko Tucakoviƒá. Pop Music was critically acclaimed, and had a large public interest. For the first time, the band had a real hit, the song \\"Sasvim obiƒçan dan\\". The other, minor hits were \\"Zmajevi\\", \\"25. Avgust\\" and \\"Sada ne znam gde sam ne znam ≈°ta\\". For all the songs Relja Mirkoviƒá had directed the music videos, and on the videos for \\"Zmajevi\\" and \\"25. Avgust\\" (recorded on the same day), Petar Dolinka was absent. By that time he had already left the band, but came back later only to do few more concerts on the Pop Music tour. Internal conflicts between Vasoviƒá and Glava≈°ki were increasing, which soon came to the point of no return. This led to the end of the first line-up of Eva Braun. Although the atmosphere in the band was dark, the band's live performances were still appreciable. The best concerts from this tour were held in Belgrade's clubs REX and SKC and in Novi Sad's Dom Mladih. The concert in SKC held in July 1996 was actually the last concert of the original Eva Barun lineup. The members did not even talk to each other at this point. After the concert, Eva Braun disbanded. = Reformation, hiatus (1996-2001) = In Autumn 1996, the members of \\"Zajedno\\" coalition invited Goran Vasoviƒá to reform Eva Braun and take part in the coalition's final meeting before the 1996 local elections in Serbia. Vasoviƒá took the chance, and called Zvonko Stojkov and Srƒëan Ljiljak, guitarist and drummer of the local R&B; band Specijalno Izdanje. The band was reformed after two days of rehearsals. The new Eva Braun lineup performed three songs at the political meeting in front of the crowd of 100,000 people. Du≈°an ≈†evarliƒá, the bassist of the Novi Sad's band Minstrelm joined Eva Braun a few weeks later. In late 1996, Eva Braun signed for a new record label, Automatik Records from Belgrade. The reissue of Prislu≈°kivanja was released with a bonus track \\"Hajde, sanjaj me sanjaj\\". In the meantime, the new line-up recorded two new songs at the \\"Drum\\" studio in Novi Beƒçej: \\"Zvi≈ædi Srbija\\" (Serbia Whistles, a cover of The Beach Boys' \\"Surfin' U.S.A.\\") and \\"Vrte≈°ka\\", composed by Vasoviƒá and Tomislav Grujiƒá of B92. A music video for \\"Vrte≈°ka\\" was also made. This led to some attention of the media and a series of concerts was made in 1997 with a good reception. In just four months period, between February and May 1997, the new line-up held more concerts than the original one had done in their whole career. As the new line-up showed good results, Goran Vasoviƒá decided to continue the band's activity. In the Summer of 1997, the band started to prepare their third studio album. The recording took place at the \\"M\\" studio in Novi Sad and \\"O\\" studio in Belgrade during the Winter and Spring. The producer was Mirko Vukomanoviƒá, who previously produced highly acclaimed album BarbieCue by Zrenjanin band Oru≈æjem Protivu Otmiƒçara. Although he left the band, Petar Dolinka continued to write songs for Eva Braun together with Vasoviƒá. Two of them wrote all the songs for the new album except for one cover. The guests on the album were Aleksandra Kovaƒç on the song \\"Santa Fe\\", actor Sergej Trifunoviƒá on the cover of Film's \\"Odvedi me iz ovog grada\\" and Tina Milivojeviƒá as a backing vocalist on \\"Mala prodavnica u≈æasa\\" and \\"Ja to radim samo kad sam sam\\". In the early June 1997, the single \\"Lavirint\\" was released accompanied by the two different music videos, directed by Aca Iliƒá, announcing the new album Heart Core. The album contained twelve songs of modern pop music, and is considered by Vasoviƒá to be the best album of the band's career. But, although the band expected Heart Core to be their magnum opus, the critical reception was mixed. The music video was filmed for the song \\"Mala prodavnica u≈æasa\\", directed by Srdan Goluboviƒá. After the series of concerts, interviews and intensive promotion, the album found its way as one of the best selling albums of the year 1998 in FR Yugoslavia. In 1998 Vasoviƒá, helped by ≈Ωeljko Rakoƒçeviƒá Kole, a Serb from Los Angeles, succeeded to make Eva Braun part of the International Pop Overthrow festival in Los Angeles. Eva Braun's performance on the festival was well received, and the band gained the opportunity to record an album for the North American market. Having returned home, the band recorded The Nowhere Land in 1999, consisting mostly of the old Eva Braun songs with lyrics in English language. The lyrics adaptations were done by Goran Obradoviƒá of Popcycle. The band changed the name for the U.S. market to Viva Brown, which was felt to be more politically correct. In 2000, Automatik Records released the compilation album First and Last, which consisted of twenty-two songs featuring the complete albums Prisluƒçkivanja and The Nowhere Land and the singles \\"Hajde sanjaj me sanjaj\\" and \\"Vrte≈°ka\\". The music video for \\"Cabaret Noire\\" (originally from The Nowhere Land) was filmed. The band then played a concert in Belgrade's \\"Saund\\", accompanied by Sa≈°a \\"D≈æule\\" D≈æuklevski who became the band's fifth member. After few more concerts in Serbia, Eva Braun started the work on their most ambitious project so far, an album entitled Vremenske zone (Time Zones). Dolinka and Vasoviƒá approached this album as prominent. The album was later renamed Everest, which is the original title of The Beatles' Abbey Road. The album was released by B92 in 2001, a year after the work had started. The first single released was \\"Meg Ryan Blues\\" accompanied by a music video, directed by Academy Award-nominated director Stefan Arsenijeviƒá. After the album's release, the farewell concert was held in Belgrade's REX club, as Vasoviƒá decided to quit performing live. Eva Braun went on hiatus. = Original lineup reunion (2007-present) = After four years of inactivity, Eva Braun was reformed in 2007 in the original line-up (Vasoviƒá, Dolinka, Glava≈°ki, Rajiƒá), with the addition of Goran Obradoviƒá on bass guitar,Eva Braun Myspace page and made a comeback concert in Beƒçej the same year. During 2008, Label Star released a compilation album Off the Record which contained unreleased and demo recordings from the 1997-2006 period. The album was available for free download on the record label official site. The album featured a new song, \\"Evergrin\\" (\\"Evergreen\\"), also released as a single, reaching the third position on the B92 annual chart for 2008. In the same year, the band made several well received concerts in Belgrade's SKC,Dragan Kremer: Bec(ejs)ki vals (Vreme 899, 27.03. 2008) Out & About: Eva Braun - SKC 22.03.2008. , Posted on 02 Sep 2008 at EXIT festival in Novi SadEva Braun na ƒêavi , S. Male≈°ev (BEƒåEJSKI MOZAIK), Thursday, July 31, 2008 and Nisomnia festival in Ni≈°. In 2008, the band started preparing a new studio album with the work title Nesanica (Insomnia). The album, retitled Playback, recorded at the Novi Sad Do-re-mi studio and produced by Peƒëa Pejiƒá, would feature selected recordings from about thirty songs the band had recorded during the sessions for the album. On 28 June 2010, the first single \\"U izgnanstvu\\" became available for free download at the B92 records official site. On February 3, 2011, the band released yet another single for free download, the song \\"Okreni moj broj\\" (\\"Dial My Number\\"). In May, the band released the single \\"Istra\\" (\\"Istria\\") for free download through Exit festival official website. Playback album was finally released digitally on 1 June 2011. In November, the band released the video for the song \\"Primenjena ljubav\\" (\\"Applied Love\\"), which featured guest appearance by Veliki Prezir frontman Vladimir Kolariƒá. On June 30, 2012, Eva Braun performed on the last evening of the first Belgrade Calling festival. On December 15, the band celebrated twenty years since the release of their debut album with a concert in Belgrade's Dom omladine. On the concert, the band performed Prislu≈°kivanja in its entirety. In January 2013, the band released the video for the song \\"Sve ≈°to gubi≈° sam ja\\" (\\"All that You're Losing Is Me\\") from Playback. The video was directed by Aleksandar Mariƒá, who used some of the material recorded for the documentary Route 66: Glavna ulica Amerike (Route 66: America's Main Street) to make the video, which was his gift to the band. In September 2014, the band released the single \\"Dan posle\\" (\\"The Day After\\"), announcing their new EP. In June 2015, the band released the single \\"Riko≈°et\\" (\\"Ricochet\\"), and in November 2015 the single \\"Kao ki≈°na kap\\" (\\"Like a Drop of Rain\\"). On September 7, 2017 the band held a sold-out concert in Belgrade Youth Centre. The concert featured numerous guests: the bands Niƒçim Izazvan and Magic Bush, Elektriƒçni Orgazam frontman Srƒëan Gojkoviƒá \\"Gile\\", Disciplina Kiƒçme frontman Du≈°an Kojiƒá \\"Koja\\", Veliki Prezir frontman Vladimir Kolariƒá \\"Kole\\", Darkwood Dub bass guitarist Miodrag \\"Miki\\" Ristiƒá, Kristali frontman Dejan Gvozden, Autopark members Ognjenka Lakiƒáeviƒá and Nikola Berƒçekom and actor Sergej Trifunoviƒá. All the funds raised from the concert were dedicated to improvement of treatment and curing of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in Serbia. In 2016, director Robert Bukarica recorded a documentary film about the band entitled The Story of Eva Braun.  Legacy  The album Prislu≈°kivanja was polled in 1998 as 75th on the list of 100 greatest Yugoslav popular music albums in the book YU 100: najbolji albumi jugoslovenske rok i pop muzike (YU 100: The Best albums of Yugoslav pop and rock music). In 2006, the song \\"Sasvim obiƒçan dan\\" was ranked No. 58 on the B92 Top 100 Domestic Songs list. The lyrics of 12 songs by the band were featured in Petar Janjatoviƒá's book Pesme bratstva, detinjstva & potomstva: Antologija ex YU rok poezije 1967 - 2007 (Songs of Brotherhood, Childhood & Offspring: Anthology of Ex YU Rock Poetry 1967 - 2007).

Early life Lewis was born in Leicester and educated at Lindisfarne College, leaving in 1935 to become a sub-editor at Everybody's Magazine. Military career Lewis joined the Artists Rifles as a private in 1937 and was then commissioned into the 6th Battalion, Queen's Royal Regiment as a second lieutenant on 19 June 1940. Following the outbreak of war, the regiment went to France in 1940 as part of the British Expeditionary Force. =North African Campaign= Attached to 8th Battalion, the Durham Light Infantry in North Africa in May 1942, in June a patrol containing Lewis encountered a line of enemy positions. A small reconnaissance force was repelled, but the patrol leader, Captain Ian English, managed to contact his superior, Major Clarke, and inform him of the situation. Clarke decided to send in a force of armoured cars filled with soldiers from the Durham Light Infantry (commanded by Peter Lewis) at 9:15am, with machine gun, mortar and artillery units to support the attack (from 2nd Battalion Cheshire Regiment and 74 Field Regiment Royal Artillery) with a barrage starting at 9:14 and finishing at 9:16. The artillery assault started a minute late, and Lewis misinterpreted Clarke's orders to halt as an order to attack immediately. The force charged towards the Italian lines while dodging their own shells, and after Lewis's armoured car ran over the only operational Italian anti-tank gun the enemy force surrendered; 20 officers and 210 other soldiers in total, along with a large quantity of machine guns, anti-tank guns and other equipment; the British lost one man in the attack. Lewis received an immediate award of the Military Cross, gazetted on 24 September 1942, while his sergeant who had killed the anti-tank gunners was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal. In 1942 he commanded a company in Operation Supercharge during the Second Battle of El Alamein; he was injured in combat, and the only officer from his unit to survive. He was again wounded in March 1943 when, on the Mareth Line, an officer nearby stepped on a mine. =Capture and escape from captivity= Following the Allied invasion of Sicily, Lewis was again injured in fighting at Catania and was captured by the Italian Army and sent to a Prisoner of War camp at Lucca. After Italy agreed peace terms in September 1943, the German Army took control of the prison camp and directed that the prisoners be transferred by train to Germany. While other prisoners on the train distracted the guards, Lewis, along with Flight Lieutenant Tony Snell, escaped through a small window. The following morning they found they were near Mantua. After a six-day walk they encountered members of the Italian resistance movement near the small village of Fabrico, who helped them hide in a safe house in Modena for almost two months. Among those members there were Don Mario Rocchi and Don Elio Monari, who had saved many British lives. With help from the Resistance, the pair gradually made it to the Swiss border, and from there they returned to England in November 1944. Lewis was Mentioned in Despatches on 1 January 1945, and Snell was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Later life Lewis retired in 1946 with the rank of acting Major and returned to his job at Everybody's, and worked as a motor racing correspondent for The Observer between 1954 and 1960. In 1949, he published his first book, co-authored with Major I R English MC, the original full title of which was 8th Battalion The Durham Light Infantry 1939‚Äì45 A History Compiled by Major P J Lewis MC, assisted by Major I R English MC from official records and personal accounts contributed by members of the Battalion.(J & P Bealls Ltd, Newcastle upon Tyne, 1949). The book has since been reprinted several times with the new title Into Battle with the Durhams. Later books include: Alf Francis, Racing Mechanic in 1957, Dicing with Death in 1961, Motor Racing through the Fifties in 1992 and The Price of Freedom in 2001. In 1953 Lewis, with other of the British Officers whose lives were saved by Don Mario Rocchi, gave a significant support to the expansion of ‚ÄúCitt√† dei Ragazzi‚Äù (Boys‚Äô Town) in Modena, that was founded by Don Rocchi to help and to train children of poor families. In 1956 Lewis introduced the Charity International Help for Children (IHC) to Don Mario Rocchi to organize summer holidays of his Italian children to live in English foster families.

Bentley, 1876), page 351 Some period sources also call him Jack Astley. A biographer of Sir Joshua Reynolds described Astley as \\"a gasconading spendthrift and a beau of the flashiest order\\". Several jaundiced contemporary accounts of Astley's character exist, notably a lengthy observation by John Williams, (aka Anthony Pasquin), who wrote: \\"He thought that every advantage in civil society was compounded in women and wine: and, acting up to this principal of bliss, he gave his body to Euphrosyne, and his intellects to madness. He was as ostentatious as the peacock and as amorous as the Persian Sophihe. He would never stir abroad without his bag and his sword; and, when the beauties of Ierne sat to him for their portraits, he would affect to neglect the necessary implements of his art, and use his naked sword as a moll-stick. He had a haram and a bath at the top of his house, replete with every enticement and blandishment to awaken desire; and thus lived, jocund and thoughtless, until his nerves were unstrung by age; when his spirits decayed with his animal powers, and he sighed and drooped into eternity!\\"Anthony Pasquin (pseudonym of John Williams), Memoirs of the Royal Academicians and an Authentic History of the Artists of Ireland (London, 1796) Career as painter In London, in the 1740s, Astley studied with Joshua Reynolds under the artist Thomas Hudson.Years cited in The Cheshire Sheaf, Volume 1 (Chester Courant Office, 1880), page 73 He later went to study in Rome and Florence in 1747 (one of his teachers was Pompeo Batoni), before establishing his career during several years in Dublin, Ireland, and afterwards settling in England.Irish Portraits, 1660‚Äî1860 (Paul Mellon Foundation for British Art, 1969), pages 46 and 47 Of his work, the Biographical Dictionary of 1789 said, \\"The best pictures he ever painted were copies of the Bentivolios, and Titian's Venus ...\\".William Betham, The Baronetage of England (Burrell and Bransby, 1802), page 379 Horace Walpole claimed Astley's prominence was based \\"on the peculiarity of his good fortune, rather than by his exertions as an artist ...\\" and added that \\"he estimated his profession only by his gains, and having obtained a fortune, treated all future study with contemptuous neglect\\".Edward Edwards and Horace Walpole, Anecdotes of Painters Who Have Resided or Been Born in England (Leigh and Sotheby, 1808), page 124 and page 126 Among Astley's own students was the engraver and historical painter John Keyse Sherwin, while Cheshire portraitist Charles Hoyland, who reportedly studied in Rome with Astley, imitated his style.Samuel Redgrave, A Dictionary of Artists of the English School (G.

To Sir Horace Mann, 1st Baronet, an Astley admirer and subject, Horace Walpole wrote of a visit to one of Astley's exhibitions in 1752, declaring, \\"I confess myself a little prejudiced, for he has drawn the whole Pigwigginhood: but he has got too much into the style of the four thousand English painters about town, and is so intolerable as to work for money, not for fame: in short, he is not such a Rubens, as in your head\\".Correspondence of the Hon.

They are transmitted live from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. The Metropolitan Opera International Radio Network airs the live performances on Saturday afternoons while the Met is in season, typically beginning the first Saturday in December, and totaling just over 20 weekly performances through early May. The Met broadcasts are the longest-running continuous classical music program in radio history,Official site and the series has won several Peabody Awards for excellence in broadcasting. The series is currently broadcast on over 300 stations in the United States, and stations in 40 countries on 5 continents. These countries include Canada, Mexico, 27 European countries, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, China, and Japan.Metropolitan Opera Radio Station Finder The broadcasts are also listenable online via streaming audio;Metropolitan Opera via Streaming Audio and select broadcasts and excerpts are listenable year- round on the \\"Met Opera on Demand\\" service\\"Met Opera on Demand\\" On-demand video and audioTsioulcas, Anastasia. \\"The Metropolitan Opera Anytime ‚Äî And Anywhere ‚Äî You Want It\\". NPR Classic (blog). March 15, 2012. and on the free online service Rhapsody.The Met on Rhapsody History The Met's radio broadcast history dates back to 1910, when radio pioneer Lee De Forest transmitted ‚Äî experimentally, with erratic signal ‚Äî two live partial performances from the stage of the Met, which were reportedly heard as far away as Newark, New Jersey. The first of these was a performance of Acts II and III of Tosca on January 12, 1910, starring Antonio Scotti as Scarpia. The following evening, January 13, 1910, parts of Pagliacci starring Enrico Caruso were broadcast. The first network broadcast was heard on Friday, December 25, 1931: a performance of Engelbert Humperdinck's H√§nsel und Gretel. The series was created as the Met, financially endangered in the early years of the Great Depression, sought to enlarge its audience and support through national exposure on network radio. In the first broadcast season only H√§nsel und Gretel and Das Rheingold (February 26, 1932) were presented in their entirety; most operas were only heard partially. From the start of the 1933-34 season, complete opera broadcasts became the norm. Since 1931 most broadcasts have been of Saturday matinee performances, with only a handful of exceptions such as the opening night of the new Met, which featured a broadcast of Samuel Barber's Antony and Cleopatra on Friday September 16, 1966. The live radio broadcasts were originally heard on NBC, and became a staple of its Blue Network. Starting in 1944 the series continued on the Blue Network's successor, ABC, through 1958. From 1958 to 1960 the series was broadcast on CBS.Metropolitan Opera International Radio Network Broadcast HistoryGodfrey, Donald G. and Frederic A. Leigh, eds. Historical Dictionary of American Radio. Greenwood Publishing, 1998. p. 257. As network radio waned with the rise of television, the Met founded its own independent Metropolitan Opera Radio Network in 1960, which is now heard on radio stations around the world. The Met's first live closed-circuit television transmission was Carmen with Rise Stevens, sent to 31 movie theaters in 27 US cities on December 11, 1952. In Canada the live broadcasts have been heard since December 1933, first on the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission.Phonoth√®que qu√©b√©coise, accessed January 21, 2008 Since 1934 they have been heard on the CRBC's successor, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, where they currently air on CBC Radio 2 on Saturday Afternoon at the Opera and on the CBC's French music network, Ici Musique on Place √† l'Op√©ra. In the late 1930s and early 1940s the broadcasts were transmitted live via shortwave to Latin America over the NBC White Network. Transcription discs made by NBC were also sent to Latin America for relay over local radio stations in much better quality. Some of these discs survive. Spanish commentary and intermission features were inserted for Spanish-speaking countries, and Portuguese for Brazil.Network Histories ‚Äì The Texaco-Metropolitan Opera Network In December 1990, the broadcast series expanded its transmission to include Europe, via satellite transmission and the European Broadcasting Union.Oestreich, James R. \\"Met Opera Live on Radio in Europe. New York Times. December 8, 1990. Australia and New Zealand joined the network in the late 1990s; Brazil and Mexico in 1999. Uruguay, Ecuador, and Japan joined in 2000. Technical quality of the broadcasts steadily improved over the years. FM broadcasts were added in the 1950s, transmitted to stations via telephone lines. With the arrival of the 1973-74 broadcasting season (December 1973), all broadcasts were offered in FM stereo. Satellite technology later allowed uniformly excellent broadcast sound to be sent live worldwide. Sponsors Financing the Met broadcasts during the Depression years of the 1930s proved to be problematic, moving between NBC, the American Tobacco Company, the Lambert Pharmaceutical Company, and RCA (then NBC‚Äôs parent company). Sponsorship of the Saturday afternoon broadcasts by The Texas Company (Texaco) began on December 7, 1940, with a performance of Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro. Texaco's support continued for 63 years, the longest continuous sponsorship in broadcast history, and also included the early PBS television broadcasts. After its merger with Chevron, however, the combined company ChevronTexaco ended its sponsorship of the Met's radio network in April 2004. Emergency grants allowed the broadcasts to continue through 2005, whereupon the homebuilding company Toll Brothers stepped in to become the primary sponsor. Additional support for the broadcasts also comes from the Annenberg Foundation, the Vincent A. Stabile Endowment for Broadcast Media, and contributions from listeners around the world. Announcers In the eight decades of its Saturday broadcasts, the Met has been introduced by the voices of only four permanent announcers. NBC announcer Milton Cross served for 43 seasons, from the inaugural 1931 broadcast until his death in 1975. He was succeeded by Peter Allen, who presided for 29 years through the 2003-04 season. Margaret Juntwait began her tenure as host the following season. From September 2006 through December 2014, Juntwait also served as host for all of the live and recorded broadcasts on the Met's Sirius XM satellite radio channel, Metropolitan Opera Radio. Following her ninth season in the job Juntwait died from cancer in June 2015. Met Opera radio producer Mary Jo Heath, who filled in for Juntwait in 2015, became the new permanent host starting with the 2015-2016 season. Opera singer and director Ira Siff has for several years been the background commentator, working alongside Juntwait and Heath. Other announcers have included veteran classical music announcer Lloyd Moss, who twice substituted for Milton Cross, Robert Woldrop, who did two broadcasts in 1937, and Deems Taylor, who was heard briefly as co-host during the early years. Author William Berger was heard occasionally as a commentator along with Juntwait. The announcer introduces each broadcast with cast information and background about the week's opera, and then introduces each act with a plot summary. Since 2006, the announcer has been joined by a commentator who adds additional background information and personal observations to the conversation. Intermission features Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center. Because live opera includes lengthy intermissions between multiple acts, the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts offer informative and entertaining opera-related intermission features. These include discussions of the opera being performed, roundtables, quizzes, interviews with various current and retired opera performers, and information on notable behind-the-scenes Met staff members. Since 2006, the lead singers of the day's opera have also been interviewed live as they leave the stage. Starting in December 2009, a new feature called Talking Opera explains various terminology used in the opera world. Among the most popular intermission features is the Opera Quiz. The quiz is usually about 20 minutes long and features a host asking a panel of three experts questions about opera which have been submitted by listeners. First introduced on December 7, 1940 as the Opera Question Forum, the Quiz was originally hosted by Milton Cross. Robert Lawrence was the Quiz host in the 1941/42 season. The 1942/43 broadcast season began with Robert Lawrence alternating with Olin Downes but in January 1943 Olin Downes became the steady Quiz host and remained until 1948. For the next ten years, the Quiz hosts were Robert Lawrence, Sigmund Spaeth, Boris Goldovsky, Deems Taylor, and Jay Harrison. From 1958 to 1996, the host was Edward Downes, Olin's son. During this time the quiz became more relaxed and featured humor and banter among the panelists as well as informative answers. Frequent guest panelists during Edward Downes's tenure as host included actors Tony Randall and Walter Slezak in addition to well-known musicians and critics including Alberta Masiello, a Met staff musical coach. Since the death of Edward Downes, the host chair has been occupied by guest quizmasters, among whom have recently been leading Met singers. During the years that the broadcasts were sponsored by Texaco, listeners whose questions were used on air were awarded gifts that usually included opera recordings and a portable radio. Other intermission features over the years have included Opera News on the Air, the Singers‚Äô Roundtable, and annual interviews with the Metropolitan Opera‚Äôs general managers. Boris Goldovsky, an opera producer and lecturer known for making opera more accessible to audiences, hosted a series of musical lectures from 1946 to the mid-1980s. Analyzing the opera being performed that day, he spoke and played the piano, illustrating his comments with musical excerpts. Commentators for the various intermission segments during the Met broadcasts have also included Marcia Davenport who appeared weekly in the 1930s, author and radio host George Jellinek, music historian and translator William Weaver, opera critic Speight Jenkins, opera historian Alan Wagner, playwright Terrence McNally, and classics scholar Father Owen Lee. Peabody Awards The Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts have won over 60 awards, including multiple Peabody Awards, the highest honor in radio broadcasting. In 1950, the Metropolitan Opera, ABC Radio, and the Texas Company (Texaco, the series' long-term sponsor) were awarded the Peabody Award in music for \\"public service in making the most brilliant opera company in the world a by-word in millions of homes.\\" The announcement commended the \\"great artists,\\" the \\"superlative orchestra,\\" and the intermission features, as well as the series' spin-off programs such as the Auditions of the Air and the Opera Album.Peabody Award ‚Äì 1950 In 1954, the Peabody committee gave a Personal Award for Radio Music to Boris Goldovsky, via the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts. The Peabody announcement noted Goldovsky's contagious enthusiasm for opera, evident in his decade of hosting intermission features and interviews on the Met broadcast series.Peabody Award, Boris Goldovsky ‚Äì1954 In 1960, the Texaco-Metropolitan Opera Network was awarded a Peabody Institutional Award for Radio Public Service. The Peabody committee cited 20 years of public service \\"of inestimable cultural value,\\" and mentioned the carefully planned intermission programs and high-level music commentary. The committee also noted the \\"long-time excellence of this series, the good taste and restraint in the commercial identification,\\" and the international use of the broadcasts.Peabody Award ‚Äì 1960 In 1982, Texaco and the Metropolitan Opera were awarded a Peabody for excellence in both radio and television broadcasting. The Peabody committee cited the more than four decades of radio broadcasts, the continued technical refinements and improvements in sound, and the \\"informative intermission features, intelligent narration, and outstanding musical quality.\\"Peabody Award ‚Äì 1982 In 1989, its 50th year of broadcasting, the Texaco-Metropolitan Opera radio series received another Peabody Award. The committee noted that \\"the Met Opera has been continually innovative in its presentation. Sound quality is excellent, performances are first-rate, and the entertaining intermissions have become outstanding programs in their own right.\\"Peabody Award ‚Äì 1989 Simulcasts and beyond In conjunction with the live radio broadcasts, a series of live television broadcasts from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera, called Live from the Metropolitan Opera, began in 1977. These live broadcasts, aired on PBS, were called simulcasts, as they were broadcast simultaneously by both a television station and an FM stereo radio station in the same geographic areas. Through these simulcasts, listeners were able to hear the operas in stereo, which was then unavailable on television. The first simulcast, La Boh√®me, featured Luciano Pavarotti as Rodolfo and Renata Scotto as Mimi, with James Levine conducting, and all three were interviewed during the intermission. In 1988, the television program title was changed to The Metropolitan Opera Presents, to accommodate the fact that the performances at that point were often taped prior to broadcast, although for a few years thereafter they were still sometimes live and simulcast on the radio. On December 30, 2006, the Met expanded its live broadcast series tradition by premiering the Metropolitan Opera Live in HD series, which transmits live Met performances in high definition video to select movie theaters and other venues across the U.S. and other parts of the world. These broadcasts are usually also aired on television several months later on the new PBS series, Great Performances at the Met. Listening options The live Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts are listenable every Saturday during its broadcast season, which typically runs from early December through the early May. These broadcasts may be accessed via hundreds of radio stations worldwide (the official website provides a station finder), or via free live streaming Internet transmission on the Allegro site and elsewhere. Historical broadcasts are archived and available to the public at the New York Public Library's Rodgers and Hammerstein Archive of Recorded Sound,Rodgers and Hammerstein Archive of Recorded Sound Rodgers and Hammerstein Archive of Recorded Sound located at the Library for the Performing Arts in Lincoln Center, New York. The archive houses almost all of the broadcasts that have been recorded, from 1937 through the present, and may be accessed by patrons on a walk-in basis. Year round, online archived video and audio of hundreds of archived complete operas and excerpts are available via the opera's \\"Met Player\\",Met Player On-demand video and audio now renamed \\"Met Opera on Demand\\", which is also available as an iPad app. Hundreds of archived audio operas and selections are now also available on Rhapsody, an online music service which offers free listening and downloads for payment. The Met's performances may be heard also on the Metropolitan Opera Radio channel on Sirius XM Radio, launched in 2006. The channel airs two or three live broadcasts from the Metropolitan Opera each week during the opera season as well as complete operas from among the 1,500 recorded broadcasts in the Metropolitan Opera archives. The channel's host and announcer is Mary Jo Heath who took over in 2015 after the death of Margaret Juntwait, and William Berger has been the writer and commentator. The Met's official site provides complete composer and background information, detailed plot summaries, and cast and characters for all current and upcoming opera broadcasts, as well as for every opera broadcast since 2000.Metropolitan Opera International Broadcast Information Center Archive: All Operas In addition, the Met's online archive provides links to all Rhapsody, Sirius XM, and Met Player operas, with complete program and cast information.

Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. . Presentation All types of Griscelli syndrome have distinctive skin and hair coloring. Type 1 is associated with neurological abnormalities. These include delayed development, intellectual disability, seizures, hypotonia and eye abnormalities. Type 2 - unlike type 1 - is not associated with primary neurological disease but is associated with an uncontrolled T lymphocyte expansion and macrophage activation syndrome. It is often associated with the hemophagocytic syndrome. This latter condition may be fatal in the absence of bone marrow transplantation. Persons with type 3 have the typical light skin and hair coloring but are otherwise normal. Genetics There are three types of Griscelli syndrome. Type 1 is associated with mutations in the MYO5A gene Type 2 is associated with mutations in RAB27A gene. Both these genes are located on the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q21). Type 3 is associated with mutations in the MLPH gene. All types are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.

It was established in 1942 by the Sisters of Charity. The school currently caters for approximately 540 students from Year K to Year 10. Boys are enrolled from Year K to Year 2, and girls from Year K to Year 10. Mount Carmel College is a member of the Sports Association of Tasmanian Independent Schools (SATIS), the Alliance of Girls' Schools Australasia, and the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA).  History  Mount Carmel College was founded by the Sisters of Charity in 1942. The Sisters of Charity were the first group of religious women to come to Australia in 1838 and to Tasmania in 1847. Their focus from the beginning was to improve educational opportunities, especially for young women; a focus which continues today at the College. \\"Little Mount Carmel\\" began in a house in View Street, Sandy Bay, and transferred to \\"Lauramont\\" on its present site in 1947. Ten years later St. Joseph‚Äôs closed and secondary classes were transferred to Mount Carmel which developed into a Preparatory to Grade 12 College. Large building programmes in the 1960s and the 1980s saw the College continue to expand and develop its resources and specialist facilities. With the establishment of Guilford Young College for senior secondary students, Mount Carmel became a Preparatory to Grade 10 College from 1995. In 1997 a Kindergarten was opened and in 1998 the College entered a new phase in its history with the appointment of the first lay Principal. =St Joseph's College= St Joseph‚Äôs School opened in 1847. It originally consisted of separate Boys and Girls Schools in the one building, St Joseph‚Äôs Boys‚Äô School, and St Joseph‚Äôs Girls‚Äô School. At this point it was located Behind St Joseph‚Äôs Church in the CBD. 1n 1893 the boys were transferred to a new school on the corner of Harrington and Patrick Streets. The Sisters of Charity retained some boys‚Äô infant classes, though. The new St Joseph‚Äôs school Building on the corner of Molle and Macquarie streets (now Collegiate‚Äôs middle school), opened in 1923. At this time the school expanded into secondary classes, and was called St Joseph‚Äôs Secondary School. In 1926 it was renamed St Joseph‚Äôs College. In 1957 the secondary classes were transferred to Mount Carmel in sandy bay, and became known as Mount Carmel College. St Joseph‚Äôs remained as a primary school until 1964, when the school moved to south Hobart as St Francis Xavier‚Äôs School.  Campus  Mount Carmel College is located on a single campus on a site overlooking the Derwent River in suburban Sandy Bay, just 5‚Äì10 minutes to the Hobart city centre. As the primary school is on the same campus as the secondary school, the primary students share major facilities with the secondary school, and regularly use many of the other facilities. The University of Tasmania is located just across the road, a few minutes walk from the school. Mount Carmel students have access to and regularly use the university sports facilities, including two ovals, five tennis/netball/basketball courts, the sports hall, squash courts, and the gym.  Facilities  Major building works have continued in the late nineties until the present time. These works include the creation of a meeting room and toilet renovation in the Lauramont building (2000), the refurbishment of the primary toilets (2000), refurbishment of the Science Laboratories and the creation of a sacred space (2001), the purchase and renovation of the former Convent, now known as Providence House (February, 2002), the refurbishment of primary classrooms (2003), the refurbishment of secondary classrooms (January, 2004), the creation of the Arts Technology building (completed February, 2004), resurfacing of the tennis court area and the most recent project, the Library and Classroom redevelopment (completed August, 2005). There has also been a significant upgrade to two of the Year Seven classrooms and their environs and a major refurbishment of the upper level of the Primary building and the access to the Primary School as a whole, and the whole of the playground equipment has been replaced and updated. In 2009 a Performing Arts Complex was created. House system Mount Carmel College has three houses: Lourdes, Loreto, and Carmel. All three houses are named after Holy places that are important to Catholics. The houses compete for the house cup by participating in sports carnivals, House drama, Beach day, and can gain extra points for things such as singing practice for Masses and Mount Carmel day, Bringing notices and Forms back on time, and Getting student diaries signed for being used properly. Curriculum In the Primary School(K-6), set subjects are studied in each year level. the younger grades(K-3) have most subjects with their class teacher. Usually, the only subjects they have with other teachers are library, P.E, music, and Japanese. The older grades(4-6) usually have more subjects with other teachers, though they are still the same subjects as before. In the secondary school, Grade 7's study set subjects, including some new ones that aren't offered in primary school. Grade 8's have the same subjects but can pick a language from either Japanese or French. Grade 9 and 10's have six core subjects(English, History, Theology and Spirituality, maths, science, HPE) and choose three electives. Co- curriculum =Sport= The School Participates in various sports through SATIS. They do very well for a small school, with grand finals often being between Mount Carmel and Collegiate. =Performing arts= Mount Carmel has choirs and bands that perform at various school and community events. House Drama is held every year, and the School Production every second year. The school hall doubles as a theatre, and has been used for auditions and rehearsals for a number of local productions. =Other= The School has debating and Tournament of Minds teams, offers involvement in outreach projects( e.g. visits to help at Bethlehem house, a homeless shelter), and supports various charities, particularly St Vincent De Paul. There are Committees for St Vincent De Paul and Amnesty International. Mount Carmel also competes in academic competitions, and programs like the Premier's Reading Challenge.

It was the first parliamentary election to be held in Latvia since the beginning of the economic crisis during which Latvia had experienced one of the deepest recessions in the world.\\"Latvians Vote in Election After Economic Crisis\\", Business Week, 2010 A total of 1,239 candidates representing 13 parties or alliances stood in five electoral constituencies equivalent to the four regions of Latvia and Riga city. With 1012 of 1013 polling stations counted, results showed an increase in support for the incumbent coalition government of Valdis Dombrovskis, with 58% of the vote and 63 of the 100 seats.\\"Latvia PM wins election, to hold coalition talks\\" Reuters, 2010 Background It appeared that early elections would be held in early 2009, when the government was faced with violent protests over the effects of the global financial crisis of 2008‚Äì2009 on Latvia and some politicians saw early elections as the only way to confront the people's anger. The elections were to be averted if the Saeima passed constitutional reform laws, including a law to allow referendums on dissolving parliament, by 2009; if this had not happened, the President of Latvia, Valdis Zatlers, would have dissolved parliament. After surviving a vote of no confidence in early February, PM Ivars Godmanis resigned on 2009 after the two largest parties (People's Party and the Union of Greens and Farmers) called for his dismissal. A new government was formed, headed by Valdis Dombrovskis.Dombrovskis chosen as Latvian PM, BBC News, 2009 There were also discussions that President Zatlers might use the parliamentary dissolution power of Latvian President to call a referendum on holding early elections. Zatlers stated on 2009 that early elections might be necessary, and that he was willing to extend the deadline for reforms from for one week to 2009 due to the collapse of the government. The tasks given to parliament were: pass constitutional amendments to allow the people to dissolve parliament, passing electoral reforms and setting up an economic supervisory council for the recovery plan and international loans. The tasks given to the government were: coming up with a recovery plan and implementing it, appointing a new head for the Corruption Prevention Board, and reorganising the government and public administration. Zatlers stated he would hold talks with politicians from all parties on 2009 and announce his assessment of the situation on the same day. On 31 March 2009, Zatlers announced he would not dissolve parliament. The Saeima was to consider constitutional amendments as early as 2009. Changes to the electoral law Several changes to the election law took effect for this election. The so-called \\"locomotive law\\" () meant that candidates were restricted to standing in one constituency. In addition to completing registration forms in paper format, for the first time, parties also had to register electronically. Voting hours were shortened, with polling stations closing two hours earlier at instead of . Finally laws relating to election spending were tightened, in particular, laws against third party advertising on behalf of political parties were strengthened. Parties contesting the election There are thirteen parties and electoral alliances running: * FHRUL (For Human Rights in United Latvia) (PCTVL - Par cilvƒìka tiesƒ´bƒÅm vienotƒÅ LatvijƒÅ) * Unity (Vienotƒ´ba): comprising the New Era Party, Civic Union and Society for Other Politics * Made in Latvia (Ra≈æots LatvijƒÅ) * Association of political parties 'Harmony Centre' (Politisko partiju apvienƒ´ba 'Saska≈Üas Centrs'): formed by the Social Democratic Party \\"Harmony\\", Socialist Party of Latvia and the Daugavpils City Party * People's Control (Tautas kontrole) * Union of Greens and Farmers (Zaƒºo un Zemnieku savienƒ´ba): consisting of the Latvian Farmers' Union and the Green Party of Latvia * For Presidential Republic (Par prezidentƒÅlu republiku) * For a Good Latvia (Par labu Latviju): of the People's Party, Latvia's First Party/Latvian Way and For a Good Latvia * RESPONSIBILITY ‚Äì Social Democratic Association of Political Parties (ATBILDƒ™BA ‚Äì sociƒÅldemokrƒÅtiska politisko partiju apvienƒ´ba) * Party 'Daugava - For Latvia' (Partija 'Daugava - Latvijai') * The Last Party (PƒìdƒìjƒÅ partija) * National Association 'All For Latvia!' ‚Äì 'For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK' (NacionƒÅlƒÅ apvienƒ´ba 'Visu Latvijai' ‚Äì 'Tƒìvzemei un Brƒ´vƒ´bai/LNNK'): consisting of For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK and All For Latvia! * Christian Democratic Union (Kristƒ´gi demokrƒÅtiskƒÅ savienƒ´ba) =New electoral alliances established= In the run-up to the election, three right- wing parties (New Era Party, Civic Union and Society for Other Politics) established an alliance called Unity on 2010. Furthermore, most of the parties constituting the Harmony Centre alliance (National Harmony Party, New Centre and Social Democratic Party ‚Äì but not the Socialist Party of Latvia and the Daugavpils City Party) had merged into the Social Democratic Party \\"Harmony\\" on 2010. On 2010, the People's Party and the Latvia's First Party/Latvian Way formed an electoral alliance (including the newly founded businessmen's movement For a Good Latvia) called For a Good Latvia. Unity on 28 May 2010 declined to include For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK and the far-right All For Latvia! in their alliance; these two parties then decided to form an electoral alliance. Pre-election debates Numerous televised debates took place prior to the election. These involved either the party leaders or other senior party figures. In all, seven debates took place on the LNT Channel, five of these were held on a regional basis and all involved parties which were polling 2% or above in opinion polls.\\"Arƒ´ LNT sola vƒìrienƒ´gi atspoguƒºot Saeimas vƒìlƒì≈°anas\\", delfi.lv, 2010.

A total of eleven debates took place on the LTV Channel, five of which were held on a regional basis, with one debate between the Prime Ministerial candidates and a further five held on the basis of five themes: Finance, Prosperity, Health, Economy and Development, and Education and Culture. Like the LNT debates, these involved parties which opinion polls indicated would poll 2% or more. A twelfth debate was held on LTV between the remaining seven parties or electoral lists which were not expected to poll 2%. The two debates held on the PBK Channel involved the four parties which the opinion polls indicated would poll 5% or more. However outgoing Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis refused to take part in the debate, following controversy over previous remarks made by the debate's moderator Aleksandr Gordon. Unity decided not to send a replacement and were absent from the debate.Diena, 2010 Polls Pre-election polls had indicated that the outgoing government could be re-elected however they had also pointed to the possibility of one of the main opposition parties, Harmony Centre, making gains and becoming the largest party in the Saeima.Financial Times, 2010 According to a poll conducted in June by Latvijas fakti, Harmony Centre would get 18.5% of the vote; Unity, 16.2%; Union of Greens and Farmers, 11.3%; For a Good Latvia, 5.3% and National Alliance, 4.4%. A later Latvijas Fakti poll conducted between 25 and 2010 showed 21.2% support for Harmony Centre, 19.2% for Unity, 9.9% for Greens and Farmers and For Fatherland and Freedom on 5.2%. For a Good Latvia, led by members of the previous government, was at 7.8%. About 19 percent of the 1,004 respondents were undecided.

History and description The Battery was one of a set of three coastal defence fortifications in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, the other two being the Ben Buckler Gun Battery at Bondi, and the Shark Point Battery, Clovelly. Each battery consisted of a gun pit that incorporated a BL 9.2-inch (234 mm) Mk VI breech-loading 'counter bombardment' British Armstrong 'disappearing' gun. The various Australian colonial governments bought nine such guns and an extra barrel before Federation. The Signal Hill gun bore Serial Number 7318 and its barrel survives and is on public display at North Fort, North Head, at the Northern end of Australia's Memorial Walk. These fortifications were the last link in Sydney's outer defence perimeter, which was intended to defend Sydney from bombardment by an enemy vessel standing off the coast. The fortifications built in the 1890s around Sydney's eastern suburbs were the culmination of some twenty years of construction of harbour defence installations that reflected the changing policy of the time to meet new technologies, threats and styles of warfare. Inside the gun emplacement The 9.2-inch (234 mm) breech loading gun was fired for the last time in 1933. It was removed and replaced in 1937 by two 6-inch (152 mm) Mk XI guns placed in each of two outer gun emplacements; these guns were removed after WWII. The fortification also has an underground complex that runs beneath Old South Head Road. It contains a maze of rooms and corridors including a mess room, elevator shaft and gunpowder magazines. The entrance from the street has been tack welded and sealed. A memorial was placed there in November 1992 by the Royal Australian Signal Corps Association on behalf of its members. Two plaques were also placed on 30 March 1993, putting the reserve in proper historical perspective.Bunker Boyz: Signal Hill BunkersWoollahra Municipal Council Local history fast facts - S Exterior See also * Military history of Australia References Batteries in Australia Buildings and structures in Sydney Bunkers in Oceania Forts in New South Wales History of Sydney Vaucluse, New South Wales ","title":"Signal Hill Battery"},{"id":"21141120","text":"Janine Gray (born January 1942 in Bombay, British India) is a film and TV actress of British descent.

The line was unique in that it was a \\"rail island\\" with no outside rail connection to a mainline railroad. Instead, rail equipment was brought in via barges that traveled between Port Townsend and Seattle. At one time there were actually 3 different Companies (the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, Port Townsend and Western, and the Port Angeles and Western) controlling the lines which ran from west of Sekiu, Washington. and west of Lake Crescent east to Port Townsend with a spur that went south toward the Hood Canal. The consolidated Peninsula Line was part of the Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific RR (MILW), which at one time was the longest electrified railroad in the world (the Peninsula portion was not electrified). A long bankruptcy and abandonment process for the Milwaukee created service and maintenance issue throughout the system. Seattle-based private entrepreneurs purchased this section of railroad from the Milwaukee's bankruptcy court. As the new carrier started, an extended period of weak markets for the pulp, paper, plywood and lumber markets, produced on the Peninsula, seriously weakened the enterprise. New efforts to improve the rail freight loadings were met with stiff competition from a barge-to-rail service (Puget Sound Freight Lines) and Piggyback services to the main-line rail carriers (Union Pacific and Burlington Northern) proved overwhelming to the highly leveraged new company. Steadily increasing maintenance costs, after years of neglect by the prior operator, finally caused a complete service shutdown followed by abandonment in 1984. The rails, ties and equipment were removed in 1987. Many adjoining property owners and public land holding agencies sought a legal end to the right-of-ways on the majority of the Line. This also included Pier 2 in Seattle's Elliott Bay, key to the Port of Seattle's expansion plan. Today significant sections of the abandoned railroad between Port Townsend and Port Angeles has been dedicated as a rails-to-trails route known as the Olympic Discovery Trail. History Portions of the rail-line were constructed in the early 1900s by various groups. The citizens of Port Angeles knew that in order to prosper, a rail line would have to link the town to the rest of the country. The first was by the U.S. Army during World War I an effort to log the spruce forests around Lake Crescent for warplane production. This segment was abandoned in 1954. Later, the rail line from Port Angeles to Port Townsend would come under the control of the Milwaukee Road until its bankruptcy in 1980 when it was taken over by the Seattle and North Coast Railroad until its abandonment in 1984.

Reprint of a book first published in 1643. The book is the first published study of an Amerindian language in English. History Author Roger Williams was a Puritan who was banished from Massachusetts Bay Colony and founded Providence Plantations which grew into the Colony of Rhode Island. He believed that the king had no right to grant title to Indian land without paying for it. He interacted extensively with the Narragansett and Wampanoag tribes as a missionary, friend, and trader. He extolled some elements of Indian culture as superior to European culture, and he wrote a complementary poem at the end of each chapter within the book. According to J.

She offered the garden to the Royal Horticultural Society in 1988. In 1990 she married Bob Berry and went to live on his farm at Tiniroto, Gisborne, New Zealand. She then created the Homestead Garden of Hackfalls Arboretum. Biography Berry was born in 1919 to the Walpole family in England. Her father was Robert Horace Walpole, the fifth and last Earl of Orford (10 July 1854 ‚Äì 27 September 1931, New Zealand). He married twice. His second marriage was on 15 September 1917 to Emily Gladys Oakes (thereafter styled as Countess of Orford), daughter of Rev. Thomas Henry Royal Oakes, and the mother of Anne.see: and checked at http://www.thepeerage.com/ One of the Walpole family members had been recorded at the siege of Acre in 1191. Later generations remained an established part of the British political, cultural and literary world. Some famous ancestors were: * Sir Robert Walpole (1676‚Äì1745), the first Earl of Orford, who became Britain's first prime minister in 1721. He made significant plantings at Houghton Hall, Norfolk, England. * Horace Walpole (1717‚Äì1797), the youngest son of Sir Robert, who became the fourth and last Earl of Orford of the first creation in 1791. He also was a knowledgeable plantsman.Wilkie 2008, p. 14 Recreated for a cousin in 1806, the title passed through the generations, Berry's father becoming the last Earl in 1894. He was aged 67 when she was born. He had no son, and decided to make over the family estate of Wolterton Hall (North Norfolk) of to a distant male cousin (who became Baron Walpole) in 1928.Wilkie 2008, p. 15 and Colborn 1987, p. 71 He emigrated to Manurewa, New Zealand, in 1928, and died in 1931. In 1923 he had bought a 40-acre () property called Rosemoor in North Devon as a fishing lodge. Berry and her mother lived there after 1928, interspersed with three visits to New Zealand in the 1930s. Thus Berry spent part of her youth in that country.Hyde, Robin ‚Äì Journalese (Auckland 1934) refers to Lady Anne Walpole and her mother the Countess of Orford who had special relations to Turkeys (p. 110f): online available at New Zealand Electronic Text Centre (NZETC) The free life in New Zealand suited her. Berry did not go to school and had a governess, but she used to dodge her, going hunting. Perhaps this can be seen in the ex libris lino-cut that Miss Hilda Wiseman (Auckland) made for her. It is printed in: The New Zealand Railways Magazine, Volume 10, Issue 1 (1 April 1935). online available at NZETC Back in England as a debutante proved to be a restricting time with all the social niceties including being present at Court.Wilkie 2008, p. 16 and Colborn 1987, p. 71/72 and see also the pictures of Bassaro (1939) with her mother at National Portrait Gallery Her mother created some of the earliest garden features at Rosemoor, such as the Stone Garden, which still lies at the heart of Berry's garden.Bailes 2008, p. 35 On 25 November 1939, Berry married Colonel Eric Palmer. Her early married life was spent \\"camp following\\" the regiment, including two and a half years in Northern Ireland. Rosemoor was loaned to the Red Cross as a rest home for Londoners from the East End suffering the effects of the Blitz. Her first son John Robert was born on 6 March 1943, her second Anthony Eric Fletcher was born 4 November 1945. After the war her husband bought more land around Rosemoor and established a dairy farm. Berry's passion was horses in those days. \\"Lady Anne's initiation into gardening was somewhat akin to the conversion of St. Paul.\\"Colborn 1987, p. 71 In 1959 Berry stayed in Algeciras, Spain, for two weeks to recuperate from measles. There she met Collingwood Ingram, a well- known English plantsman, who opened her eyes to the world of plants.Wilkie 2008, p. 15 Collingwood Ingram sent loads of plants to Rosemoor from his own garden in Benenden, Kent. This was the start of a marvellous collection. In 1960 serious development of the garden started. Soon there were other mentors such as Lionel Fortescue (The Garden House at Buckland MonachorumThe Garden House), the Heathcoat-Amory family of Knightshayes Court and others.Colborn 1987, p. 73 Berry rapidly grew a knowledge on conditions that plants needed. Travels to New Zealand and Australia, Papua New Guinea, Japan, North America and temperate South America allowed her to see plants and plant combinations growing in their natural habitats, and gave her opportunities to collect material. In the late 1960s she joined the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS). Robin Herbert, who later became a president of RHS invited her to join Floral Committee 'B' which judged woody plants and new introductions. She was also a founder member of the National Council for the Preservation of Plants and Gardens (NCCPG). In 1965 Berry joined the International Dendrology Society (IDS). In the 1970s she chaired the tours committee for nine years until about 1983. She then became chairperson of the society for nearly five years. In 1970 she visited New Zealand and went to see Eastwoodhill Arboretum, Ngatapa, Gisborne. Its founder, William Douglas Cook had died a few years before. \\"Despite its then run-down condition it was to me a very impressive collection, at that time managed single-handedly by Bill Crooks\\", she remembered.Anne, as cited by: Berry 1997, p. 115 In 1977 a group of members of the IDS visited New Zealand again. She then nominated Eastwoodhill for the first brass plaque presented by the IDS for tree collections of outstanding merit. She then visited Abbotsford Arboretum (now Hackfalls Arboretum), the creation of Bob Berry for the first time. In 1979 Berry started a small nursery at Rosemoor. By 1987 the catalogue had expanded to over 1000 items. She developed a collection of less common trees, and of Hollies (Ilex) and Dogwood (Cornus), later resulting in Rosemoor holding part of the UK NCCPG National Collection for these plants. In 1980 her husband died. In 1988 she offered Rosemoor to the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS): the house and the garden (), and the remaining of the estate, that was farmland. By 1990 Rosemoor was opened as a \\"garden for all seasons\\". In 1990 Berry led a group of IDS members to Hackfalls Arboretum for the second time. She married Bob Berry later that same year. \\"The story of Bob and Anne Berry of Hackfalls is a classic one in terms of the bonds created by dendrology\\".Berry 1997, p. 115 The marriage took place in England, but they came to live at Tiniroto. In July 2006 Bob and Anne Berry left Hackfalls Station to live in Gisborne town.

She described it as \\"a sort of mini Wisley\\".in Anne's own words, as cited by Colborn 1987, p. 71 Wisley is the \\"flagship garden of the RHS\\".RHS website Wisley In 1988 she gave the garden to the Royal Horticultural Society, together with an additional of land. Christopher Bailes, curator of Rosemoor Garden, stated in 1988: \\"Lady Anne's garden was (and remains) a very personal garden, largely informal and relaxed in style, with extensive areas of parkland and arboretum. The 'new' RHS developments were intended both to expand upon and to complement the existing garden, featuring diverse and wide-ranging plantings, many in a more formal framework, with particular emphasis on ornamental and productive horticulture.\\"Bailes 2008, p. 36/37 Hackfalls Arboretum Hackfalls Arboretum, Tiniroto, Gisborne, New Zealand, was the creation of Bob Berry, who started planting trees at his station in the 1950s, and created interesting collections of poplars, maples, oaks etc. Bob became a member of the IDS in 1977 and in October 1982 joined a tour to Mexico, which was the beginning of a particular interest in Central American Oaks (Quercus), which would later form the most important part of the collection of Hackfalls Arboretum. In later years other trips to Mexico followed to collect acorns.Wilkie 2008, p. 18 When Anne came to live at Hackfalls Station in 1990 the management of the farm had already been taken over by Diane and Kevin Playle (Diane is a daughter of Bob Berry's sister Pet), the name being changed from Abbotsford Station to Hackfalls Station. Hackfalls Station had been the name of the original property of the Berry family at Tiniroto, when they first came to live there at the beginning of the 20th century. The collection of the arboretum at 1990 contained about 3,000 taxa. The number of different species of trees, shrubs and climbers has been enlarged since then. Anne extended the homestead garden at Hackfalls and introduced many new plantings.Wilkie 2008, p. 19 In 1993 the arboretum was protected by a covenant with the Queen Elizabeth II National Trust. Since 2006 Diane Playle takes care of the arboretum and the homestead garden. The collection at the arboretum in 2008 held 3,500 different taxa.

Kastro tis Orias) was a castle at the foot of Panachaiko mountain, in the modern municipality of Aigialeia, Achaea, Greece.  History  The castle was first built by the local barons of the Latin Principality of Achaea between 1280 and 1310. With the years, a large town developed around it. The site was naturally strong, at the top of a hill behind which the river Foinikas ran. Because of the steep cliffs there, no fortifications were required on that side. In 1460, Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II invaded the Peloponnese, and the castles of the Byzantine Despotate of Morea submitted, one after another, often without resistance. Salmeniko was the last stronghold to offer resistance, under the command of Graitzas Palaiologos. The fortress resisted for a year, as the Ottoman siege guns were unable to destroy the walls. Only after the Janissaries managed to find and cut the fort's water supply line, did the town surrender. According to folk tradition, the residents threw sponges suspended from ropes from the castle, and thus collected water from the river below, until the Janissaries discovered it and started cutting the ropes. The town's inhabitants, 6,000 according to the historian Stefanos Thomopoulos, were enslaved, while 900 children were selected for the Dev≈üirme. Graitzas however and a number of defenders still held out in the citadel. As a condition for surrendering it, he demanded free passage of his men. Mehmed accepted and departed unmolested for Aigio, leaving a certain Hamouzas as governor of the Peloponnese and Thessaly, and to oversee Graitza's departure. Hamouzas disregarded the agreement, however, and arrested the first men who tried to leave the citadel. Informed of this, Mehmed replaced him with Zaganos Pasha and left the Peloponnese. However, Zaganos too renewed the siege of the citadel. Graitzas then attempted a sortie, and managed to break through and find refuge in the Venetian-held fortress of Lepanto. The fall of Salmeniko signalled the complete submission of the Peloponnese (with the exception of Venetian holdings like Nafplion, Methoni and Koroni) to the Ottomans. Today, the castle and town lie in ruins, which are still visible on the site. A medieval bridge survives intact, while the \\"Oria rock\\" (ŒíœÅŒ¨œáŒøœÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ©œÅŒπŒ¨œÇ), where, according to local tradition, a princess was killed by a traitor during the Ottoman siege, is nearby.

Records indicate this particular bomber was assigned to the 315th Bomb Wing, 501st Bomb Group Northwest Field is a former World War II airfield on Guam in the Mariana Islands. It was closed in 1949. In ~September 2020 a C130J landed, delivering a fire truck. History Northwest Field is located on the CHamoru settlement Upi, which was a significant settlement during the Spanish-Chamorro Wars of the late 17th century. In the 19th century, Upi was a cattle ranching center. Northwest Field was constructed in 1944‚Äì45 near Ritidian Point on the northwest end of the island of Guam as a base for Twentieth Air Force B-29 Superfortresses to carry out the strategic bombing campaign against the Japanese Home Islands. Construction was accomplished by the Army Air Corps 1865th Aviation Engineering Battalion and United States Navy Seabees from the 53rd Naval Construction Battalion. Deployed ground echelon personnel also assisted in construction, prior to the arrival of their group's air echelon. In April 1945, it became the home of the 315th Bombardment Wing, the command organization for the 16th (Diamond-B), 331st (Diamond-L), 501st (Diamond-Y) and 502d Bombardment Groups (Diamond-H). The field ultimately had two runways, the north and south runways. The south runway was the first to be completed. However, when the first 315th aircraft were deployed to Guam, the south runway was still under construction, and they had to land at nearby North Field (which eventually became today's Andersen AFB). When the main air echelons of the 16th and 501st Bomb Groups arrived the south runway was complete, but the taxiways were not. Aircraft had to be towed to their parking spaces over the rough coral. By the time the air echelons of the 331st and 502nd Bomb Groups arrived, both runways were complete. The 331st Bomb Group used the ramp space in the center of the base, the 502nd Bomb Group used the area on the east side, and the 16th and 501st Bomb Groups used ramp space on the west side. The 315th Bomb Wing was unique as its groups flew the B-29B Superfortress, the only true variant of the B-29 ever manufactured. These aircraft were actually stripped-down versions of the normal B-29, bereft of the General Electric gun system and a variety of other components, in order to save weight and increase bomb-carrying capacity. The resultant unladen weight of 69,000 pounds was a vast improvement, lessening the strain on engines and airframe and enabling the payload to be increased from 12,000 to 18,000 pound ordnance. In addition, the 502nd and all of the other 315th groups were equipped with the new AN/APQ-7 \\"Eagle\\" radar sets, which gave a much clearer presentation of ground images through a wing-shaped radar vane slung beneath the fuselage. It also gave a biplane effect in appearance. The \\"Eagle\\" was the product of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Eagle radar development group. It had been designed especially for night missions. During World War II this special antenna and equipment for precision night radar missions was so secret that no B-29s were ever shown with it, and there are no actual official photographs in existence. The only armament on these aircraft was in the tail, where two .50 caliber machine guns were installed. Missions had to be planned and prepared so that briefing material could be slanted from the radar point of view. Its groups flew \\"shakedown\\" missions against Japanese targets on Moen Island, Truk, and other points in the Carolines and Marianas. Bombing missions commenced against targets in the Japanese homeland on 26 June 1945 when the wing damaged the Utsube River oil refinery at Yokkaichi. Thereafter, oil targets in Japan served as the wings primary targets during the summer of 1945. On 14 August 1945, nine days after the Atomic Bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 143 B-29 aircraft from the 315th Bomb Wing left Northwest Field on a secret mission. The mission was the longest continuous mission ever attempted by Twentieth Air Force, a distance and a duration of 17 hours. The mission was to destroy the largest remaining oil reserves in Japan at Akita. After holding for a long time, they finally lifted off at 4:42 local time. They had a secret recall code. It was \\"Apple\\", but the recall never came. Near Chichi-jima Japanese radar picked them up and shortly thereafter Tokyo went black, expecting a strike. A total of 132 aircraft reached the primary target and accomplished their mission. All aircraft returned safely, although the aircraft were down to their last gallons of gasoline, and 13 had to land in Iwo Jima to get fuel in order to make it back. The 315th was ordered to fly this mission for several crucial reasons: * It was learned that on 14 August that Emperor Hirohito had decided to unconditionally surrender and was to make a recording that night which would be played on Japanese Radio on the 15th. War Minister Anami and his Generals had other plans. They wanted to continue the war so they must kill the traitorous advisers and kidnap the Emperor who they were still spiritually bound to. But this plan turned into chaos and was abandoned hours after the power was turned off in Tokyo, and thus obviated the need for an Allied invasion of Japan and the deaths of millions. The Emperor's recording was played the following day. * President Truman wanted to end the war as soon as possible. Ending the war at once would stop the bloodshed and keep the Soviet Union out of the process to end the Pacific War. The Soviet Union had entered the Pacific War after the Atomic Bombing of Nagasaki, and was moving its forces rapidly though Manchuria and heading for the Korean peninsula directly for the Japanese Home Islands. It was believed that if the Japanese delayed the surrender, the Soviet Union would ask for reparations from the Japanese and attempt to divide Japan politically by invading Hokkaid≈ç as was the case in Germany and to claim an occupation zone. The United States wanted the war to end immediately before this to keep the Soviets out of Japan. It was, essentially, the beginning of the Cold War. The attack by the B-29s achieved its desired purpose with the Japanese military, and President Harry S. Truman announced the official end of the Pacific War as the B-29s were returning to Northwest Field. It was the last combat mission flown by the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. When hostilities ended, the wing's B 29s carried relief supplies to Allied prisoner of war camps in Japan and Manchuria before moving to other bases in April 1946. The airfield was also used as a facility for inactivating various air force units after the war. In the postwar era, Northwest Field (later, Northwest Guam AFB), was used by the 20th Fighter Wing, 23d Fighter Group (23d Fighter Wing after 16 August 1948) between 10 October 1946 and 3 April 1949, where the group flew training, interception, and island defense missions with F-47 Thunderbolts until the base was closed due to fiscal reasons. Current status Today the wartime airfield is all but abandoned, although the runways are used occasionally by rotary-wing aircraft from nearby Andersen Air Force Base for training purposes. Most of the wartime taxiways and revetments still exist and the two airfields are still linked by taxiways. In 2008, Northwest Field was undergoing a rehabilitation and construction effort costing more than $200 million to provide barracks, vehicle facilities, simulators, classrooms, armories, warehousing and training sites for highly specialized forces. A total of 89 projects encompass the building of 80+ facilities that include roads, water tanks, pump houses, utilities as well as an electrical grid and substation. The wartime taxiways that once allowed the dispersal of hundreds of B-29 heavy bombers are now overhung by jungle. But in a clever piece of innovation, they are being used for practicing defense and reaction against convoy ambushes. Other new construction includes weapons ranges, field exercise areas and an unused residential area that has been turned into an urban assault course. The south runway has been opened for helicopter and air- drop operations and was recently used ~September 2020 where a C130J landed to deliver a fire truck.

He played college football at Ohio State University. Early years Sualua didn't start playing football until his freshman year at Santiago High School, where he was a guard and defensive tackle. The next year, he transferred to Mater Dei High School, where he played as a fullback and defensive end. As a sophomore, he helped his team compile a 13-1 record and win the state title. As a senior, he had 85 carries for 562 yards (6.6 avg.) and 9 touchdowns, despite missing five games with a high ankle sprain he suffered in the opening game. He was voted the MVP of the South Coast League and scored 6 touchdowns in the opening round of the playoffs. He also lettered in wrestling and weightlifting, winning the state title in 1991. College career Sualua accepted a football scholarship from Ohio State University. After being redshirted as a freshman, he started the last 8 games of his sophomore year at fullback, blocking for Eddie George. He tallied 18 carries for 106 yards and 7 receptions for 70 yards. He posted career-highs with 6 carries for 44 yards against the University of Alabama in the Citrus Bowl. He started the final 10 games of his junior season, blocking for George on his way to winning the Heisman Trophy in 1995. He registered 18 carries for 106 rushing yards (5.9 avg.), 17 receptions for 129 yards and 2 touchdowns. He had career-highs with 5 receptions for 57 yards against the University of Michigan. He declared as an early entrant to the NFL Draft, after being ruled academically ineligible to play in his senior season (1996). Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Sualua was selected in the fourth round (129th overall) of the 1997 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys, to develop as the eventual successor to Pro Bowl fullback Daryl Johnston. As a rookie, he was declared inactive in the first 6 games, until Johnston suffered a season ending neck injury against the Washington Redskins in the sixth contest of the season. Although he was active, he remained a backup behind Herschel Walker until the season finale against the New York Giants. On May 6, 1999, former Pro Bowl offensive tackle Mark Tuinei was found unconscious in his car after spending the previous evening with Sualua. He was pronounced dead upon arrival at a hospital in the Dallas suburb of Plano, with the autopsy revealing that he died of a combination of heroin and a form of the drug ecstasy. His death was ruled an accidental overdose and Sualua was never charged or suspended for the events surrounding Tuinei's death. He was waived on June 15, 1999, with the team claiming it was for football reasons. In his first two years he was mainly a backup and played on the special teams units. =Cincinnati Bengals= On June 25, 1999, Sualua was signed by the Cincinnati Bengals. He was released with an injury settlement on September 2. Personal life His cousin Troy Polamalu was an All-Pro strong safety for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Early years Arrese was born in Bilbao to a Basque family which was noted for its support of Carlism.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1990, p. 14 He went to Madrid in order to train as an architect, obtaining his doctorate in architecture in 1932. As a student he was a member of the conservative Asociaci√≥n de Estudiantes Catolicos and was also a founder of the Federacion Espanola de Trabajadores, a workers organisation that focused on anti- communism. Falangism It is unclear when Arrese first joined the Falange as sources disagree. Philip Rees states that Arrese was a founder member of the group in 1933 but Wayne H. Bowen states that he did not become a member until 1936.Wayne H. Bowen, Spain During World War II, University of Missouri Press, 2006, p. 86 Either way however Arrese associated himself with the camisa vieja tendency, a hardline faction made up of early members of the movement. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War Arrese found himself in the Republican zone and took refuge in the Embassy of Norway before escaping to the Nationalist section in 1937. A close associate of Manuel Hedilla, he backed his ally in his quarrel with Francisco Franco and as a consequence was sentenced to two years imprisonment by a Francoist military tribunal. However his release was promptly arranged by General Gonzalo Queipo de Llano, a Francoist who nonetheless had a good relationship with Arrese. He returned to some influence as jefe provincial of M√°laga in December 1937 and helped to ensure the development of low cost housing and efficient fuel provision in the region. He was a strong supporter of the national syndicalism that formed part of original Falangist ideology and published a book in 1940 entitled La Revolucion Social del Nacional Sindicalismo. Nazism An enthusiastic supporter of Nazism, Arrese was one of the first to propose the creation of the Blue Division to support the Nazi war effort.E. de Blaye, Franco and the Politics of Spain, Penguin Books, 1976, p. 148 On 20 May 1941 in an attempt to appeal to Adolf Hitler, who was still enjoying much success in World War II at the time, Arrese was one of three extremists appointed to the cabinet by Francisco Franco, in this case to the position of General Secretary of the Movement.De Blaye, Franco, p. 147 The appointment was a shrewd one by Franco as, although Arrese was identified with the Old Shirt tendency, he also had a strong personal loyalty to El Caudillo.Bowen, Spain, p. 86 Arrese retained his strong interest in Nazism and in January 1943 he made a visit to Nazi Germany where he met with Adolf Hitler and Joachim von Ribbentrop and inspected German aircraft and building projects. This was to be the last formal contact between Spain and Germany before the fall of Hitler.Wayne H. Bowen, Spaniards and Nazi Germany, University of Missouri Press, 2000, p. 150 Despite his enthusiasm for the Nazis Arrese did intimate to Hitler that he felt there was a wide gap between the two ideologically as Arrese was a lifelong devout member of the Roman Catholic Church. On 20 July 1945 Arrese was removed from his position, his appointment no longer politically expedient, and indeed the role was left symbolically vacant in an attempt to disassociate Francoist Spain from fascism.De Blaye, Franco, p. 161 Post-war He enjoyed a return of sorts in 1956 when Franco dismissed Raimundo Fern√°ndez-Cuesta as the leader of the paramilitary Blue Shirts, although in truth the role had lost much of its importance as both the Army and the Monarchists had grown in power at the expense of the traditional Falangists.De Blaye, Franco, p. 187 In attempt to regain control for the Falangists he approached Franco the following year with a new draft constitution that would enshrine totalitarianism in Spain and threatened to resign if it was denied. Franco however rejected the move, endorsing a much more pro-monarchy document and, in a cabinet reshuffle, handing Arrese the humiliation of the very minor portfolio of Minister of Housing.De Blaye, Franco, pp. 193-4 By 1960 Arrese had disappeared from any governmental role.De Blaye, Franco, p. 194 Disillusioned by the development of post-war Spain he made a speech in 1958 on the anniversary of the death of Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera in which he stated \\"you [Primo de Rivera] cannot be satisfied with this mediocre, sensual life\\". He left his role as Minister of Housing in 1960 after being refused an increase in departmental social housing budget. He retired from public life, eventually settling in Corella where he died in 1986.

He fought in the Second World War, initially as an infantry officer in the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, before training as a pilot and transferring to the Royal Air Force. He was shot down several times and eventually became a prisoner of war. Post- war, he returned to the army, serving again with the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers in the Korean War, and later commanding a battalion of that regiment. Early life and Second World War The stepson of an admiral, Leith-Macgregor initially trained at the Nautical College, Pangbourne, but could not deal with the five hours of mathematics a day, and after three years transferred to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. On passing out, he was commissioned into the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers as a second lieutenant on 25 August 1938, and was posted to the 2nd Battalion. He served in Belgium in 1939, but became bored with serving as a soldier, and instead volunteered to be trained as an army liaison pilot, gaining an additional RAF commission as a pilot officer in the Royal Air Force on 11 April 1940. After training on a de Havilland Tiger Moth, he was taught to fly the Westland Lysander and posted to No. 241 Squadron RAF. He was transferred to No. 208 Squadron RAF to fly the Hawker Hurricane in the North African Campaign, and twice crashed. He was first shot down, but survived unharmed despite his crashed aircraft being strafed by three German fighters before he could escape. On the second occasion, his engine failed and he was forced to crash-land; it later transpired he had taxied in an active minefield without detonating anything. He had retained his army commission and was promoted lieutenant on 1 January 1941, and in the RAF, war substantive flying officer on 11 April 1941. In June 1942, he was attacked by four Messerschmitt Bf 109s; he destroyed one, but was himself shot down. Despite again being strafed by the remaining planes, he once again survived unscathed, and returned to his base just in time to find his flight sergeant (who had witnessed events) organising a burial detail. Leith-Macgregor was immediately awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. The citation was published in the London Gazette on 28 July 1942: He was again shot down in August over El Alamein and was trapped inside the aircraft with the ammunition exploding. Nearby German soldiers broke through the canopy with an axe and helped him escape. After an attempt to escape, he was transferred to an Italian Prisoner of War camp where he was brutally interrogated and held in a cage measuring five feet by three feet. He was transferred to a camp in Gavi and after the Italian armistice sent to Stalag Luft III; he did not escape in The Great Escape but was instead transferred yet again to a naval prisoner of war camp near Hamburg, where a sergeant from the Scots Guards cut the wire and let the prisoners escape. Korean War and later life On 26 August 1945, he relinquished his RAF commission to return to army duty as a lieutenant. He rejoined the Fusiliers, was promoted captain on 1 July 1946, and served with the 1st Battalion in the Korean War. While there, he was promoted temporary major, and given command of the battalion's Y Company. For the leadership he displayed on 3 January 1951, he was awarded the Military Cross for placing Y Company so well on a hill that, despite an attack by a massive Chinese force, the enemy were unable to dislodge them, and the company withdrew without a single man killed. Brigadier Brodie, commander of 29th Independent Brigade described it as \\"a performance of the highest order\\" when countersigning the recommendation. The award was announced in the London Gazette on 10 July 1951. He received substantive promotion to major on 25 August 1951. He then commanded a company at Eaton Hall Officer Cadet School followed by a spell as second in command of a battalion of the Nigeria Regiment and as training officer of the 7th battalion RNF (the Territorial Army unit associated with the regiment). Promoted lieutenant colonel on 5 February 1960, he commanded the 1st battalion before, aware he had no staff training, he retired on 5 December 1962. In retirement he worked first as a Guinness representative, and later as a marketing director for Rank Hotels and the Park Lane Hotel.

Hrvatin started playing handball in Rijeka at local club RK Kvarner. At Kvarner he passed various youth selections before playing at the senior level. Career He started his senior career at club RK Peƒáine which at the time was in the First B League. In 2000 he got called up to play for Zamet in the First League (later Premier League) where he spent most of his career. Hrvatin's first two seasons saw him playing at top level in the league and reaching the finals of the Croatian Cup. He debuted in his first European competition in the EHF Cup Winners' Cup, reaching the fourth round in 2001 and 2002 being eliminated by FC Porto and Montpellier. Hrvatin established himself quickly in Zamet. Up until the 2006-07 season Zamet was in top flight of the league and then the club hit financial trouble so big that at one time they weren't paying salaries to Hrvatin and captain Milan Uzelac and Robert Savkoviƒá among others. In 2008. Hrvatin was called up to play for the national team by coach Lino ƒåervar and was picked for the 2009 World Championship. In January 2009, Hrvatin moved to Croatia Osiguranje Zagreb for the remainder of the 2008-09 season and with the club won the Premier League and Cup. He reached the quarter-final of the EHF Champions League with the club. In July 2009 Hrvatin returned to Zamet and stayed there for four more years. In his second spell his most notable accomplishment was reaching the finals in the Croatian Cup in 2012 and playing qualifiers in the EHF Cup the next season. They lost their first qualifier to Meso Lovoseice on aggregate. In August 2013 Hrvatin left Zamet and started playing for RK Crikvenica. For two seasons he competed for the club in First league (second tier) and at one time he was the coach and sports director. In August 2015 Hrvatin announced that he'd be returning to Zamet yet again. After his announcement there was a lot of doubt if Hrvatin could still play at top level because he had turned 35. In his first season back, he showed great form and ended up being the club's top scorer of the season while helping Zamet to the league play-offs for the first time in ten years. Zamet finished in fourth place reaching the EHF Cup qualifiers. During the qualifiers they beat Cr√©teil and CSM Bucure»ôti. Zamet reached the third qualifying round of the EHF Cup where they were defeated by MT Melsungen. Hrvatin announced his retirement at the end of the 2016-17 season alongside his long standing teammate Milan Uzelac. Personal life Hrvatin is married and has a son.

After having acted in an estimated 7,500 dramatic shows on radio, he devoted his final decade to television and, from April 1962 to January 1965, was a key member of the supporting cast in two prime-time series and made at least twenty major guest- starring appearances in many of the top drama series of the period. Radio career and Perry Mason A native of the San Francisco Bay city of Oakland, Larkin developed a distinctively resonant voice perfectly suited to radio, the prime entertainment venue in American homes during the Depression 1930s. By the latter part of the decade, when he was in his mid-twenties, Larkin had worked for a number of stations, including KCKN and WHB in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area, where he was an announcer and, later, in Chicago, where he became known for versatility in performing announcing and hosting duties in addition to acting in front of the microphone for numerous scripted shows, including Vic and Sade, one of network radio's most popular programs of the 1930s, and the one for which he received his first major credit as a radio actor. He also played Frankie McGinnis in the 1935‚Äì41 NBC radio soap opera Girl Alone, a role that included some singing. An item in Movie Radio Guide noted, \\"when the script calls for Frankie to sing, John Larkin does his own singing.\\" Following military service in World War II, he established himself in the capital city of network radio, New York and, having become one of the medium's top dramatic voices, was offered, in 1947, the title role in CBS Radio Network's three-and-a-half-year-old afternoon crime serial, Perry Mason which, as was the case with all radio daytime dramas, consisted of an 11-minute script, broadcast Monday through Friday in a 15-minute time slot, including commercials, promos and credits. A renowned criminal lawyer, Perry Mason was a fictional character created by attorney Erle Stanley Gardner who, starting in 1933, became one of America's best-selling mystery writers. Almost immediately following his first appearance in book form, Mason was adapted to the big screen with three actors portraying him in six films produced by Warner Bros. between 1934 and 1937. The radio show premiered during the middle of the war, in October 1943. While primarily concerned with crime, detection and legal procedure, it was still structured in the manner of a soap opera, with omnipresent organ music, laundry-product commercials from its sponsor, television's largest advertiser, Procter & Gamble, and its 2:15 time slot, sandwiched between two \\"standard\\" soap dramas. A number of actors voiced Mason during the show's early years, with Bartlett Robinson, Santos Ortega and Donald Briggs, each performing for several months. Shortly before John Larkin took over the role in May 1947, Irving Vendig, who became the program's new head writer seven months earlier, reinvigorated Mason's personality and brought the show which, to Erle Stanley Gardner's dissatisfaction, had become less and less distinguishable from Procter & Gamble's domestic soaps, back to its courtroom theatrics, suspense and crime detection roots.The Perry Mason TV Show Book website with two photographs of John Larkin ‚Äî one from 1944 and the other taken during his stint as radio's Perry Mason Larkin's familiar authoritative voice had soon come to symbolize the Perry Mason radio persona and he remained with the role for eight-and-a-half years until the program's conclusion in December 1955. During the show's run, he also continued to perform in radio's numerous primetime dramas ‚Äî as an example, in May 1948, he was in Lux Radio Theater's version of the 1946 Gary Cooper vehicle Cloak and Dagger (May 3), and Ford Theater's versions of The Front Page (May 9), playing Hildy Johnson, as well as Laura (May 30), in which he voiced police lieutenant McPherson, who falls in love with the portrait of the title character. By the early- to mid-1950s, however, most of radio's entertainment and information programming had already transferred to the new medium of television, with the process reaching its completion at the start of the 1960s. Daytime television and The Edge of Night Although Larkin had done some television announcing and isolated acting appearances during the medium's early years, his first sustained work came in the final year of his Perry Mason radio run. Another Procter & Gamble radio soap, Road of Life, which had been on the air since 1937, had initiated a separate TV version, which premiered on CBS' daytime schedule December 13, 1954. Following the pattern set by radio, much of daytime programming, including all soaps, was structured as 15-minute productions during television's first eight years of full-schedule broadcasting (1948‚Äì56). The show's leading characters, Dr. Jim Brent, a surgeon, and his wife, were played by daytime veterans Don MacLaughlin and Virginia Dwyer who also voiced the roles in the radio version. Nine months after the show's cancellation on July 1, 1955, MacLaughlin and one of radio's earlier Perry Masons, Santos Ortega, would spend thirty and twenty years, respectively, on one of daytime's first two half-hour soaps, As the World Turns. John Larkin, as Dr. Brent's friend, Frank Dana, had a medium-sized role amidst the show's large supporting cast, including thirty-year-old Jack Lemmon who, later in the year, would be cast in his Oscar-winning role as Ensign Pulver in Mister Roberts. Larkin played Frank Dana for the first four months of the show's course, with another actor briefly playing the part in subsequent episodes. Road of Life lasted only six-and-a-half months on TV, but continued on radio for another four years, finally ending its twenty-two-year run in 1959. Larkin remained with Perry Mason until its final episode at the end of the year and was almost immediately offered a continuation of the role on television. Procter & Gamble could not, however, come to terms with Erle Stanley Gardner regarding Perry Mason's position as a daytime TV character and the defense attorney, while remaining with CBS, returned in twenty-one months, on September 21, 1957, as a primetime show, starring Raymond Burr. Daytime's biggest advertiser, however, had another solution, which still permitted Larkin to portray afternoon TV's \\"Perry Mason\\" in all but name. Irving Vendig, having scripted the radio Perry Mason for the past nine years, proposed the creation of a late-afternoon daytime drama with basically the same Perry Mason-type scripts, except for the name of the lead criminal lawyer, who would be called Mike Karr. John Larkin thus had his first television leading role, and The Edge of Night, premiering, along with As the World Turns, on Monday, April 2, 1956, ushered in a new era of half-hour soaps to TV, with other daytime dramas eventually expanding to a 30 minutes, then an hour and, ultimately, in one unsuccessful experiment (NBC's Another World) to 90 minutes. The Edge of Night's title was derived from the fact that it aired at the end of the afternoon period, 4:30, a late time slot which had never previously been occupied by a soap. A forceful and dynamic actor, the 44-year- old Larkin was the dramatic fulcrum of the live show, delivering vividly effective courtroom speeches and presenting human frailty tempered by stalwart determination in the face of the multiple vicissitudes which the plotlines devised for dedicated crime fighter Mike Karr and his eventual wife, Sara Lane, whom Mike married in 1958, at the start of the show's third year. As the storylines began, Mike was a police officer attending law school who, upon passing his bar exam, became an assistant district attorney and, in the course of time, a criminal attorney in private practice. The show was one of the most popular offerings in daytime television and made the middle-aged Larkin something of a sex symbol, receiving sackfuls of fan mail. Producers of prime- time shows had also taken notice, with Larkin receiving inquiries regarding his availability. The Edge of Night, however, which revolved almost entirely around him, required his full attention. The show's place in its audience's affection was ultimately measured by a widely reported event of Friday, February 17, 1961 when, in the final scene of that day's live episode, Sara ran out of the house after the Karrs' two-year-old, Laurie (played by Victoria Larkin, daughter of John Larkin and his wife, Audrey Blum), had wandered into the street, followed by the sound of screeching tires and an impact. Unseen over the weekend, Sara Karr turned out to have saved Laurie at the cost of her own life, as she lingered in a coma during Monday and Tuesday episodes, finally dying on Wednesday, February 22 and engendering an avalanche of calls to CBS along with thousands of letters (over 2,500 in the first day alone). In a response, unprecedented in the annals of daytime drama, Larkin and the actress who had played Sara, Teal Ames, appeared on-screen following the last scene of the next day's episode, with Ames explaining that she was fine and had simply decided to leave the show in order to pursue other career options. Later that year, John Larkin also arrived at the decision that the time had come for a new career direction which, in his case, meant Hollywood. Mike Karr's final installment, on October 10, had the intrepid lawyer departing for the state capital to organize a crime commission. For the next two months, the plotlines centered around supporting character Ed Gibson, another crime- fighting attorney, played by Larry Hagman, until Mike Karr, now portrayed by Laurence Hugo, returned in mid-December.McMurran, Kristin. \\"This Time There's No Doubt Whodunit as ABC Turns Out the Lights on the Long-Running Soap Edge of Night\\" (People, January 7, 1985) First year in Hollywood and Saints and Sinners Although he was born in the San Francisco Bay area, Larkin had spent his entire career in other venues and was now, shortly before his fiftieth birthday, returning to his native state of California. In his remaining three years, he worked continuously, appearing in prime-time TV shows (including four guest-starring roles as four different characters on Raymond Burr's Perry Mason) as well as playing supporting roles in three feature films. All of Larkin's prime-time appearances were in hour-long dramatic shows, with the first six broadcast within a five-week period in 1962. He was a guest star in the April 24 episode of Leslie Nielsen's police drama The New Breed, followed three days later, on April 27 by a role in The Detectives Starring Robert Taylor. The following day, April 28, he appeared as one of the murder suspects in \\"The Case of the Counterfeit Crank\\", the first of his four Perry Masons. Three days later, on May 1, he was seen in the \\"Savage Sunday\\" installment of the prestigious anthology series, The Dick Powell Show, which was structured as the pilot episode for his upcoming newspaper series, Saints and Sinners. On May 18, he returned to guest-star in another episode of The Detectives Starring Robert Taylor and, on May 31, appeared in an installment of the highly rated 1920s crime series, The Untouchables. The following months were spent in filming episodes of NBC's Saints and Sinners, starring Nick Adams, who achieved high recognition in his previous series, ABC's half-hour western The Rebel, which ran from 1959 to 1961. Seeking to promote the highly touted Saints and Sinners, NBC showed selected repeat episodes of The Rebel from June to September 1962 as a summer replacement program for The Joey Bishop Show. Monday, September 17, the day Saints and Sinners' premiere episode was scheduled for broadcast in the 8:30‚Äì9:30 time slot, John Larkin made an appearance on NBC's afternoon series, Here's Hollywood, which specialized in celebrity interviews and show promotions, talking about his career and his hopes for the new venture. A hard-hitting drama which focused on human- interest stories appearing in the fictional newspaper, New York Bulletin, Saints and Sinners posited Nick Adams as impetuous and emotional reporter Nick Alexander who wore his heart on his sleeve, and John Larkin as his mentor, the wise and understanding city editor Mark Grainger, a veteran newspaperman who had seen it all. A particularly noteworthy episode, \\"A Shame for the Diamond Wedding\\", written by Ernest Kinoy and broadcast on November 26, 1962, guest- starred Oscar winner Paul Muni in his final acting role as a feisty ninety- year-old (Muni was 67 at the time) who files for divorce from his eighty- eight-year-old wife (played by Lili Darvas) to refocus the priorities of his venal and short-sighted children and in-laws to the true meaning of life. \\"New Lead Berlin\\", the 17th and final episode of the series, shown on January 28, 1963, spotlighted John Larkin in a dual role, as Mark Grainger confronted his lookalike, Bartley King. Ultimately, despite respectful critical notices and devoted viewing from a measurable segment of the audience, the drama could not overcome the competition from CBS' top-rated sitcoms The Lucy Show and The Danny Thomas Show and ABC's western, The Rifleman, with the two-hour slot, which included Saints and Sinners' 7:30‚Äì8:30 lead-in, It's a Man's World, filled the following week by NBC Monday Night at the Movies. Guest appearances and feature films in 1963‚Äì64 1963 was another busy year for Larkin, with nine guest appearances plus the final four installments of Saints and Sinners. In early January, he was seen on three consecutive days, with the first two occurring on TV's most popular western series, Gunsmoke and Bonanza, followed by the Monday, January 7 episode of Saints and Sinners. The Saturday, January 5 Gunsmoke installment, \\"Louie Pheeters\\", spotlighted him as cunning murderer Murph Moody, while on Sunday, January 6, he had what may be considered the finest acting assignment of his guest-starring career‚Äîthe title role in the Bonanza episode, \\"The Colonel\\". The central character is Frank Medford, a friend of Ben Cartwright from his youthful days, who arrives in Virginia City, presenting himself as a successful businessman and charms all the ladies, especially the still-attractive, prosperous widow, Emily Colfax, played by Helen Westcott. A charismatic, larger-than-life personality, who is ultimately exposed as a fraud, but one with his heart in the right place, Larkin's \\"Colonel\\" dominates the episode and his portrayal may be among the most memorable in the show's history. The remaining seven guest shots were on February 26, in another installment of The Dick Powell Show, then March 12, in another Untouchables, followed by \\"The Case of the Greek Goddess\\", the April 18 episode of Perry Mason in which, as sculptor John Kenyon, he is exonerated by Raymond Burr's Mason of murdering his Greek model's hostile mother. He was next seen five days later, on April 23, in yet another Dick Powell, followed by \\"Dear Uncle George\\", the May 10 episode of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour. The year's last two appearances came in episodes of the 1963‚Äì64 season, with yet another Mason, \\"The Case of the Reluctant Model\\" (in which he is again a murder suspect) broadcast on October 31, and an episode of The Fugitive, seen on November 12. Finally, 1964 ushered in five more guest-starring roles, a second series, and three feature films, which represent John Larkin's entire career on the theatrical screen. \\"Better Than a Dead Lion\\", the January 20 episode of the psychiatric series Breaking Point, marked his first performance in the new year, followed by the February 7 broadcast of \\"The Evil of Adelaide Winters\\", another installment of Hitchcock. February 12 saw the release of the Rod Serling-scripted film, Seven Days in May, directed by John Frankenheimer. The political drama about a planned military takeover of the U.S. Government, was filmed during the final months of the Kennedy administration and starred Burt Lancaster as the chief plotter, General Scott, with an unbilled John Larkin appearing in two scenes as one of his co-conspirators, Colonel Broderick. Then, on March 9, came \\"The Duncan McIvor Story\\", an episode from Wagon Train's season of 90-minute color episodes, with Ron Hayes as the title character, an army lieutenant, and Larkin, playing yet another colonel, as his superior. The final two guest shots were seen during the 1964‚Äì65 season. Larkin's fourth Mason episode, \\"The Case of the Betrayed Bride\\", was his last and, once again presented him as a murder suspect. At the end, on December 31, there was an episode of Kraft Suspense Theatre, \\"The Wine-Dark Sea\\". Each of the two feature films, lensed between April and October, gave him three scenes with some well-defined medium shots. Walt Disney's family drama, Those Calloways, directed by Norman Tokar, billed him eighth, behind Brian Keith, Vera Miles, Brandon deWilde, Walter Brennan, Ed Wynn, Linda Evans and Philip Abbott. Playing Linda Evans' father, a wise and compassionate small-town shopkeeper, he provided supportive advice to his daughter and the object of her affection, played by Brandon deWilde. The other feature, The Satan Bug, a doomsday thriller about the theft from a bacteriological lab of a deadly virus capable of causing immense casualties, was directed by John Sturges and scripted by James Clavell from the novel by Alistair MacLean. Larkin, playing a government scientist received fifth billing, after George Maharis, Richard Basehart, Anne Francis and Dana Andrews. His longest scene comes at midpoint and consists of a detailed explanation of the danger posed by the \\"bug\\". Final work on Twelve O'Clock High and death John Larkin's last work came in filming episodes for his second series, ABC's Twelve O'Clock High. True to pattern, he was, once again, cast as an authority figure, the stern yet humane Major General Wiley Crowe, the supervising commander of strategic bombing crews, relaying orders to Frank Savage, the youthful Brigadier General in direct charge of the missions. Although the Quinn Martin production was based on the 1949 film in which Gregory Peck portrayed General Savage, Larkin's character was originated for the series. Quinn Martin, who used Larkin in two of the series he produced, The Untouchables and The Fugitive, provided strong dramatic confrontations between the top-billed Lansing, whose General Savage held a delicate balance between personal concern for his men and the responsibilities of command decision, and second-billed Larkin, himself a World War II veteran, who imbued General Crowe with the palpable comprehension of the heavy burden incumbent in relaying life-and-death orders from the top. Filming of the first episodes began in May 1964 and the premiere episode was broadcast on Friday, September 18, in the 9:30‚Äì10:30 time slot. A few of the episodes placed Larkin at the center of dramatic conflict, particularly \\"The Climate of Doubt\\" (October 23), in which General Crowe faces a board of inquiry for a risky strategy intended to aid the French Resistance. At the time of his death on January 29, the day episode 19 was broadcast, Larkin was in the midst of filming the 25th episode of the 32 scheduled for the season. He continued to be seen until the installment of March 19, with the remaining seven episodes featuring generals portrayed by John Zaremba, Paul Newlan and Lin McCarthy. John Larkin died at Valley Doctor's Hospital in North Hollywood after being stricken with a heart attack at his home. He had a daughter, Cathleen, from his first marriage and, another daughter, Sharon, from his second marriage, on June 10, 1950, to future Edge of Night actress Teri Keane, who, after his departure from the series, spent eleven years (1964‚Äì75) as a member of the cast. In addition to his daughter Victoria, he and his third wife, Audrey, were also the parents of a son, John Jr.\\"John Larkin Dies, Radio-TV Actor, 52\\" (The New York Times, January 31, 1965, p.89) The two films on which John Larkin received billing, Those Calloways and The Satan Bug, both premiered in New York on April 14, 1965, three days after what would have been his 53rd birthday.

The 4-1000A is the largest of a series of tubes including the 4-65A, 4-125A, 4-250A, and the 4-400A. These tubes share a common naming convention in which the first number identifies the number of elements contained within the tube; i.e., the number ‚Äú4‚Äù identifies the tube as a tetrode which contains four elements (filament, control grid, screen grid, and anode), and the second number indicates the maximum continuous power dissipation of the anode in Watts. The entire family of tubes can be used as oscillators, modulators, and amplifiers.  Specifications  The 4-1000A is a relatively large glass tube with an overall height of 9.25 inches and a diameter of 5 inches. It is designed to operate with its plate (anode) at an orange-red color due to the \\"getter\\" being a zirconium compound on the anode structure which requires a great deal of heat to be effective. The cathode is a directly-heated, thoriated-tungsten filament rated at 7.5 volts at 21 amperes. Connections to the filament and grids are made via a special 5-pin socket, and the anode connection is at the top of the tube. The tube may be operated as a class C amplifier in which a single tube can provide up to 3340 watts of RF power. A pair of tubes may be operated as an audio-frequency modulator for an AM transmitter; in this case a pair of tubes will provide up to 3,840 watts of audio power.Data sheet for the Eimac 4-1000A  Internal construction  The 4-1000A is of radial construction; the most obvious feature is the large, roughly cylindrical, blackish anode suspended from the top of the tube. The anode, which may be constructed out of metal or graphite, is finned for increased heat dissipation. The filament and grids are supported from the lower section/base of the tube.  Sources  The 4-1000A was available from multiple manufacturers including RCA,RCA Transmitting Tubes TT4, 1956 EIMAC,EIMAC Power Grid Tubes Quick Reference Catalog 175 AMPEREX, and Triton.  Cooling  A complete cooling system is required to operate the tube at rated values. A centrifugal fan pressurizes the equipment chassis and provides a continuous stream of cooling air. A specially designed socket is used to direct the air over the filament and grid connections, and a glass chimney (Pyrex¬Æ) then directs the air around the tube's glass envelope; chassis-mounted metal clips are used to center the chimney around the tube. Finally, a finned, cylindrical heat sink is attached to the anode connection (top of the tube) to provide additional cooling for the anode's glass-to-metal seal. Variants The 4-1000A was modified for operation in pulsed applications; the modified tube, identified as the 4PR1000A/8189, can be operated with anode voltages as high as 30 kV DC and peak plate current of 8.0 Amperes, but at a reduced duty cycle.Data sheet for EIMAC 8189 / 4PR1000A References Vacuum tubes ","title":"4-1000A"},{"id":"21141497","text":"Oskar Homolka and Danielle De Metz in \\"The Ikon of Elijah\\", an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1960) Danielle De Metz (born 27 July 1938) is a French actress best known for her numerous guest appearances in movies and television shows throughout the 1970s.

History A year following the establishment of the city of La Plata as the capital of the Province of Buenos Aires, four local intellectuals, Manuel Lainez, Arturo Ugalde, Mart√≠n Biedma and Julio Botet formed a partnership with the purpose of giving the new town (the first planned city in Argentina and South America) a daily newspaper. The hamlet depended on Buenos Aires media and counted with only one local periodical: La Propaganda (a listing of classified ads). Their preparation led to the 2 March 1884, launch of El D√≠a, whose first issue boasted 4 pages and cost 5 cents; 900 copies were circulated that day. Published in a small building near the former freight railway depot, the owners of the struggling daily persuaded a distinguished retired journalist, Jos√© Mar√≠a Mend√≠a, to serve as its first director. Soon earning renown for its timely coverage and for its outspoken editorials section on page 4, El D√≠a was directed for most of the era between 1894 and 1952 by Hugo Stunz, who fended off periodic competition from the numerous upstart dailies which enjoyed a passing history in La Plata during the 20th century. The growing daily drew much of its new staff from the prestigious local University of La Plata and its related high-school, the Colegio Nacional. From the latter, El Dia hired David Kraiselburd, who would become a prominent local lawyer, head of the university alumni federation, and journalist. By 1961, Kraiselburd had become editor-in-chief, and, along with the Fascetto family (heirs of Stunz's daughter), bought an important share of El Dia. Inheriting a financially strapped company, Kraiselburd's staunch opposition to the era's military coups, and innovations such as special sections, helped recover El D√≠a, whose circulation soon averaged over 70,000. Kraiselburd was murdered by the far-left Montoneros in 1974, and El D√≠a has since been directed by the owner's son, Ra√∫l Kraiselburd, who was also recognized as an advocate of free press. According to Columbia University's School of Journalism, which awarded both father and son the prestigious Moors Cabot Prize (in 1975, posthumously, to the former; in 2003 to the latter), the Kraiselburds maintained the independence of El Dia, which reported on disappearances and other issues that were covered up by most of the Argentine media during the Dirty War (1976‚Äì1983). The 1980s and 1990s brought different challenges ‚Äì the launching of other local newspapers, the worldwide spread of the internet, which had a detrimental effect on print papers ‚Äì and El Dia therefore strengthened its local sections (sports, but also, remarkably, an important section that took the role of \\"ombudsman\\" of the county, where citizens could send their complaints) as well as its coverage of international news. In the 2000s, El Dia strengthened its interactive relation with its readers via more online resources (there is a section called \\"Send Your Own News\\") and an online form to present complaints and comments to the \\"Advocate of the Neighbors\\" (Defensor de los Vecinos).

History Butaritari Atoll Airport was built in Kiribati during World War II by the United States after seizing the island from the Japanese. Construction lasted approximately one month, from November 20 to mid-December, of 1943. During the war, the airport was known as Makin Airfield, Butaritari Airfield, Antakana Airfield, or Starmann Field. The airfield was the base of operations for the United States Army Air Forces Seventh Air Force 41st Bombardment Group which flew four squadrons of B-25 Mitchell medium bombers. Missions from the airfield were flown against Japanese shipping, bypassing islands in the Marshalls and Caroline Islands. In addition to the 41st, the 43d Fighter Squadron (15th Fighter Group) flew P-39 Airacobras and the 531st Bomb Squadron (380th Bombardment Group) flew A-24 Dauntless light attack aircraft from the airfield in late 1943 and early 1944. The Americans pulled out at the end of 1944, abandoning the airfield. After the war, the airfield was turned into a commercial airport.

They are historically neither Hindu nor Muslim and their occupations have changed over time, as circumstances have dictated for survival. Although similar groups in India are often referred to as Adivasi, the Dhanka generally reject this term. The Dhanka name may be derived the somewhat pejorative word dhanak, meaning a forest dweller. However, it could also come from dhanush, meaning bow, which may reflect a historic association with that weapon. Tribal people - as agriculturists and hunters - historically carried bows with them everywhere. Anthropologist Megan Moodie says that their history and culture is poorly documented and that what does exist \\"tend[s] to be brief and stress their 'insignificance' and lowness\\". She notes that they are a sub-tribe of the Bhil people, that they are today found throughout much of western India, and that there has been much official confusion regarding their identity, which has tended to impact on their position as a Scheduled Tribe (ST) entitled to various positive discrimination benefits. Much of that confusion centres around various names that have been posited as synonyms for Dhanka( The King Of Forest )including Dhanak, Rajput, Dhanuk and Thakur. The Dhanka share many cultural similarities with the Rathwa and Naikda tribal people, and are largely indistinguishable from them. The Rathwa provide pithora ritual paintings for the interior walls of Dhanka homes. Described by Shereen Ratnagar as \\"vibrant colours ... teeming with gods, people, plants, birds and animals\\", creation of this artform is unique to the Rathwa. The 2001 Census of India recorded the Dhanka in the state of Rajasthan as one of the 30 STs which did not form part of the Bhil, Mina and Bhil Mina tribes. Those latter communities accounted for 93 per cent of the ST population at that time, whilst the combined population of the Dhanka, Tadvi, Tetaria and Valvi, which was recorded as being one community, comprised 77,047 people.

The ships were to be named Amagi, , Atago, and Takao. The Amagi design was essentially a lengthened version of the battleship, but with a thinner armored belt and deck, a more powerful propulsion system, and a modified secondary armament arrangement. They were to have carried the same main battery of ten guns and been capable of a top speed of . Limitations imposed by the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty prevented the class from being completed as designed. However, the treaty had a limited allowance for hulls already under construction to be converted into aircraft carriers. Amagi and Akagi were both intended for conversion, but an earthquake damaged the hull of Amagi so extensively that the ship was scrapped. Akagi was reconstructed as an aircraft carrier and served with distinction as part of the Kido Butai during the Second World War, participating in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor before being sunk at the Battle of Midway. Design =Dimensions and machinery= The ships had a planned displacement of and at full load. The class design was long at the waterline, and overall. The ships would have had a beam of and a draft of Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 235 and would have used four propeller shafts, powered by Gihon steam turbines. The design staff intended to use turbines, which were to be powered by 19 Kampon water-tube boilers, eleven of which were oil-fired, while the other eight were to have mixed oil and coal for fuel. This system was designed to provide for a top speed of . The planned fuel stores amounted to 3,900 tons of oil and 2,500 tons of coal. The ships had a planned cruising speed of , and with full fuel stores, the ships would have had a maximum range of . =Armament= The ships were to be equipped with a main battery of ten L/45 gunsL/45 denotes the length of the gun barrels; in this case, the gun is 45 calibers, meaning that the gun is 45 times long as it is in diameter. guns in five twin-gun turrets, although an L/50 gun tested in 1920 might have been used instead. The guns fired armor- piercing projectiles with a propellant charge at , at a rate of fire between 1.5 and 2.5 rounds per minute. Each gun had 90 rounds and an approximate barrel life of 250‚Äì300 shots. The turrets would have been arranged along the centerline: two superfiring turrets fore, and three in line aft of the superstructure. The gun turrets weighed 1,004 tons (1,020 mt), and allowed for depression of ‚àí5 degrees and elevation of 30 degrees. The secondary battery was to have consisted of sixteen L/50 guns mounted in casemates along the center of the ship. These guns fired projectiles and used of propellant at a muzzle velocity of . The guns had a maximum elevation of 25 degrees, which enabled a maximum range of . Four, later increased to six, L/45 anti-aircraft guns were to have been mounted amidships, along with eight above-water torpedo tubes. =Armor= It was planned that the Amagi class would be protected by a main belt thick, sloped at 12 degrees, and a torpedo bulkhead thick. The main battery barbettes were designed to have between of armor plating, and the conning tower would have had armor ranging in thickness from to a maximum of . Deck armor was to have been thick. Background Experiences in the Russo- Japanese War convinced naval war planners that more fast capital ships were needed, so on 4 April 1907, the Imperial Defence Council approved an \\"Eight- eight\\" policy. This plan originally called for a fleet of eight battleships and eight armored cruisers that would all be under ten years old (later changed to eight battlecruisers and reduced to eight years old). However, the advent of the dreadnought battleship crippled this plan at the beginning; given Japan's weak and underdeveloped economy and the enormous strain that had been put on it during the Russo-Japanese War (Japan emerged from the war victorious, but bankrupt),Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 222 the launch of was a \\"disaster\\" for Japan.Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 223 In 1907, Japan was halfway to the eight-eight, with two newly delivered battleships (the ) in the fleet and two more (the ) and four armored cruisers authorized or under construction. In addition, three more battleships and four armored cruisers had been authorized, though not funded. However, naval technology was changing; older battleships, including all of Japan's battleships in commission or under construction,While the s were technically \\"semi- dreadnoughts\\" due to their heavy secondary battery, they were still made obsolete by . were quickly rendered obsolete with the commissioning of HMS Dreadnought (hence the terms dreadnought and pre-dreadnought), and armored cruisers were seemingly useless in the face of the new battlecruisers being laid down by Great Britain and Germany. The IJN recognized this, and proposed in 1909 that two battlecruisers be ordered from British plans, with one to be built in Great Britain and one to be built at home. These two ships became the . Another pair of Kongos were later built in Japan. In 1910, there was still authorization for one battleship and four armored cruisers. This battleship, a more heavily armored version of the Kong≈ç-class battlecruisers, became Japan's first super-dreadnought, . With these ships, Japan appeared to be getting closer to the eight-eight goal; however, these new ships represented a \\"new level of naval strength\\" for the IJN, and they made all previous Japanese capital ships obsolete. This meant that any naval planner aiming for an eight- eight fleet would have to call for seven more battleships and four more battlecruisers at a time when Japan was trying to weather a worldwide economic depression. After proposals from the IJN in 1911 and 1912 for massive shipbuilding programs, the Cabinet compromised down to a \\"four-four\\" plan; under this, three new battleships (the other ship and the two ships) and no new battlecruisers were authorized.Gardiner and Gray (1984), pp. 222‚Äì223 The Navy did not agree, and instead called for an \\"eight-four\\" fleet, while the Imperial Defence Council called for the original eight-eight. The Cabinet relented, and by July 1914, it was decided to aim first for an eight-four fleet, followed by the eight-eight fleet. The eight-four plan was presented to the Diet of Japan in 1915; it aimed to have the eight battleships and four battlecruisers by 1923 with the building of two and two s. The problem with this was that the old plan intended all of the ships of the eight-eight fleet to be under eight years old; by the time these new ships were completed, Fus≈ç and the first two Kong≈ç ships would be past their replacement age.Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 224 The plan was approved in 1917, along with funding for two battlecruisers which became the Amagi class. In late 1917, the Navy proposed to expand the eight-four plan by adding two more battlecruisers; this was approved, and two more Amagi-class ships were ordered. However, having eight gun ships (four battleships and four battlecruisers) on order put an enormous financial strain on Japan, which was spending about a third of its national budget on the Navy. The massive size and scale of its building program was rapidly driving up the cost of naval construction and armament. Construction, cancellation, and conversion alt=A large ship, covered with scaffolding, sits in harbor under a large gantry. was the first ship of the class to be laid down; construction began on 6 December 1920 at the naval yard in Kure. Amagi followed ten days later at the Yokosuka naval yard. The projected completion dates for the first pair of ships were December and November 1923, respectively. Atago was laid down in Kobe at the Kawasaki shipyard on 22 November 1921, and was projected to be finished in December 1924. Takao, the fourth and final ship of the class, was laid down at the Mitsubishi shipyard in Nagasaki on 19 December 1921, and was also projected to be completed in December 1924. The ships were named after several mountains: Amagi, Akagi, Atago, and Takao.Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships (p. 235) states that Takao was named for the town of Takao, Formosa, and some sources repeat this. However, the name Takao for Japanese warships predated the renaming of the town, and Lacroix (p. 122) states that the name was simply re-used for the battlecruiser. Takao was initially to have been named Ashitaka after Mount Ashitaka.Katagiri, p. 93 The Washington Naval Treaty, signed in February 1922, greatly reduced the tonnage allowed for capital ships in the signatory nations. The treaty also instituted a moratorium on new warship construction; battlecruisers canceled under this included one class each from Japan, the United States, and Great Britain: the Amagi class, the and the G3 class, respectively.See: Washington Naval Treaty, Chapter II, Part III, Section II The treaty did allow for battleship and battlecruiser hulls currently under construction to be converted into aircraft carriers, but only if these new carriers were kept under a 27,000-ton limit. Considering that the Amagi class were designed to displace at full load in their battlecruiser configuration, this would have been a rather difficult displacement to obtain. However, the Americans also had the same problem when designing a conversion of their Lexington class, so an exception, spearheaded by US Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., was added to the treaty that gave the five signatories the option of converting up to two capital ships that were under construction to 33,000-ton aircraft carriers.Friedman (1983), p. 43See: Washington Naval Treaty, Chapter I, Article IX This resulted in the United States and Japan quickly reordering two ships each. Japan chose Amagi and Akagi, the two ships nearest to completion, for conversion. Their guns were turned over to the Imperial Japanese Army for use as coastal artillery; three of their main gun turrets were installed in Tokyo Bay, Busan, Korea, and on Iki Island in the Strait of Tsushima. The rest of their guns were placed in reserve and scrapped in 1943.Gibbs & Tamura (1982), pp. 192, 194 The September 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake in Tokyo caused significant stress damage to the hull of Amagi. The structure was too heavily damaged to be usable, and conversion work was abandoned. Amagi was stricken from the navy list and sold for scrapping, which began on 14 April 1924. The other two ships, Atago and Takao, were officially canceled two years later (31 July 1924) and were broken up for scrap in their slipways. The incomplete Tosa-class battleship , on which work had stopped on 5 February 1922, was reordered as a carrier to replace Amagi.Gardiner and Gray eds.

Early life A native of Madrid, Fern√°ndez-Cuesta studied at the local university, where he gained a law degree.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster, 1990, p. 124 He was a close friend of Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera from childhood. An early member of the Falange, which he joined in 1933, he served as the movement's first secretary and garnered a reputation as one of the new group's most effective public speakers. He was a candidate for the Falange at the 1936 election, although he was not elected. Spanish Civil War Fern√°ndez-Cuesta was imprisoned upon the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War by Republicans and, although he escaped twice, was recaptured on both occasions. He was released from captivity in October 1937 when he was involved in a prisoner swap with Justino de Azc√°rate, who was held by the Nationalists. Soon after his release he was appointed Secretary general of the unified Falangist-Carlist movement although he did not prove talented as a political organiser and was replaced in the role by Agust√≠n Mu√±oz Grandes in 1939. His appointment as leader was largely intended to keep onside Falangists who feared the influence of both the Army and monarchism on Franco, but the role proved to have little power since real influence over Franco was instead to lie with Ram√≥n Serrano S√∫√±er.De Blaye, Franco, p. 141 Within this early Burgos-based government of Francisco Franco, he also fulfilled the role of Agriculture Minister.E. de Blaye, Franco and the Politics of Spain, Penguin Books, 1976, p. 139 This too however proved to be largely a failed endeavour. Removal Such was the influence of S√∫√±er that, after the Spanish Civil War, he engineered the effective exile of his rival Fern√°ndez-Cuesta, who was appointed Spanish ambassador first to Brazil (1940‚Äì1942) and then to Italy (1942‚Äì1945).De Blaye, Franco, p. 142 Alongside this, Fern√°ndez-Cuesta's reputation was damaged by his failure in the Agriculture portfolio, with Spain facing famine in the 1940s largely as a consequence of the failed policies he had previously adopted in the role.Paul H. Lewis, Latin Fascist Elites, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, p. 82 Nevertheless, his personal loyalty to Franco was never less than absolute, a fact that ensured he would never be fully excluded from positions of influence. Return to politics Fern√°ndez- Cuesta was effectively absent from the frontline of Spanish politics until 1945 when he was appointed Minister of Justice.De Blaye, Franco, p. 161 As part of his remit he oversaw a liberalisation of Spain's treatment of dissidents designed to win the regime support from NATO, including announcing in December 1949 plans to release 13,000 political prisoners (although in fact only 3,000 were ultimately released under the scheme).De Blaye, Franco, p. 175 He was moved in 1951 to the post of General Secretary of the Movement and oversaw a return to much more draconian ways as unrest over rising unemployment repression under Fern√°ndez-Cuesta's direction.De Blaye, Franco, pp. 177-9 He lost this position in early 1956 after Franco came under pressure by leading figures in the Army to remove him following a riot at the University of Madrid in which it was said that the Falangist Frente de Juventudes had acted too heavy-handedly in battling students seeking to organise their own syndicate outside of the official government body.De Blaye, Franco, p. 187 His position was however filled by his ally Jos√© Luis de Arrese as Franco continued to seek a balance between the different wings of his movement within the cabinet. Effectively sidelined, Fern√°ndez-Cuesta became loosely associated with extreme rightists such as General Iniesta Cano and Blas Pi√±ar.De Blaye, Franco, p. 357 Removed from the political front-line once again, he nonetheless remained a member of the Cortes Espa√±olas he became recognised as one of the most hard-line and reactionary of the old clique of Franco loyalists who continued to occupy the back benches of the parliament.Rees, p. 125 He was especially critical of the gradual liberalisation that began to creep in during the early 1970s as an increasingly frail Franco began to exercise less day to day power. After Franco After Franco's death he re-founded the Falange Espa√±ola de las JONS, a nostalgic group that failed to make any headway in democratic Spain.C.P. Blamires, World Fascism - A Historical Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 233 Despite leading his own party he was allowed to simultaneously hold membership of Blas Pi√±ar's Fuerza Nueva, with the two parties running a joint campaign in the 1977 election. The groups managed only 0.21% of the vote however. Fern√°ndez-Cuesta retired from politics in February 1983, with Diego M√°rquez Horrillo succeeding him as Falange Espa√±ola de las JONS leader. He published his memoirs, Testimonio, Recuerdos y Reflexiones, in 1985.

Liberty Classical's meaningful purpose is to \\"classically educate children to be moral leaders who impact the culture for Christ.\\"http://libertyclassicalacademy.org/about/statement-of- faith/ It is a member of the Association of Classical Christian Schools. Liberty Classical was launched in the autumn of 2003 by a group of parents seeking to give their children a solid Christian education along with rigorous academic standards, and to teach them how to think critically and learn for themselves.\\"In their own hands: Stillwater residents help found 'classical' education academy in Maplewood,\\" Stillwater (MN) Gazette, December 4, 2003, p. 1. The first 28 students, in grades K‚Äì8, met at Lake Phalen Community Church in Maplewood. By 2006 the school had grown to over 100 students, and it expanded by moving grades 6‚Äì11 into classrooms at First Evangelical Free Church, a few miles to the north. (In the fall of 2009, grades PK-5 moved to Christ the King Lutheran Church in White Bear Lake.) In June 2008, the first class of four seniors graduated, and that fall, the preschool was opened. Both campuses merged in the fall of 2014 at their new campus in White Bear Lake, MN. Despite its small size, Liberty has already had one National Merit Scholarship Finalist and another student Commended.\\"Merit Scholar semifinalists named\\", St. Paul Pioneer Press, September 28, 2007, p. 3B. This was the Semifinalist roster; lists of Finalists and Commended students were not published in local newspapers. Academics A classical education teaches students how to learn, reason, and communicate effectively. These three phases are known as the Trivium, and correspond to the natural stages of child cognitive development. In the grammar stage, roughly from grades PK‚Äì6, children \\"amaze adults with their ability to absorb large amounts of information.\\"http://www.libertyclassicalacademy.org/cms/one.aspx?pageId=977866 At Liberty, these students use fun songs, chants, skits, and rhymes to memorize everything from punctuation and sentence-structure rules to chemical elements to U.S. Presidents. Mastery of reading is emphasized, with 15 minutes oral reading part of daily homework. Between grades 7 and 9, children enter the logic phase, asking \\"why?\\" questions in their quest for deeper understanding. At this stage, Liberty introduces formal logic, equipping students with the tools they need for critical thinking and sound reasoning. Finally, in grades 10 through 11, students move into the rhetoric stage, where they naturally seek to express their own conclusions about what they have learned. At this point, Liberty teaches formal rhetoric, \\"[enabling] students to clearly and persuasively communicate their own ideas.\\" Liberty's first graduating class Liberty believes that all children can learn and achieve at a high level, when the expectations are high and the classroom is an exciting place that engages their attention.http://libertyclassicalacademy.org/academics/ From the earliest grades, students memorize famous poems or speeches and recite them to their peers. Extra credit and prizes are awarded to students for reading \\"challenge books\\" beyond their grade level. Science Fair projects begin in second grade. \\"By the time students are in high school, they are writing 20-page thesis papers on what they believe.\\"\\"Students receive a classic education\\", Shoreview (MN) Press, March 18, 2008, p. 1A. Every member of the senior class researches, writes and presents a formal Senior Thesis to the Liberty school body and receives a grade from a panel of faculty judges trained in rhetorical exercise. This rite of passage provides students the opportunity to put into practice all of the self-directed learning and logical evaluation and communication skills they have obtained at Liberty and thereby demonstrate their readiness for higher education. Latin is taught from grades 3 to 8, both to improve analytical thinking skills and \\"because of its broad application in a variety of areas,\\" including medicine, classical literature, and the foundations of the English language. Since 2004, Liberty students have earned honors in the National Latin Exam. Two years of a modern foreign language (Spanish and German are the 2008-09 offerings) are also required before graduation.\\"Private school adds 2nd location\\", St. Paul Pioneer Press, July 22, 2006, p. 1B. Christian worldview Cantamus Christi choir in concert Liberty is a multi-denominational Christian school, and welcomes students of any or no religious background, with the understanding that only basic Christian doctrine will be taught. > \\"The Christian element gives kids a moral grounding, and it is so important > for our culture to have a moral grounding. When kids are taught that they > are created by God and that he has a plan for them, it gives them a > purpose‚Äîwhich in turn gives them motivation and self-confidence outside of > what the world can provide.\\" > ‚ÄîRebekah Hagstrom, Director As the classical approach also encourages the development of virtue and leadership, students at every level participate in community service and ministry projects. Seniors must provide leadership roles in campus activities and fulfill 30 hours of community service, which culminates in a ministry trip every spring. In May 2009, they will \\"spend a week helping lower-income elderly in Washington D.C. maintain their homes' exteriors and yards through Episcopal Senior Ministries, a program that helps older folks stay in their homes as long as possible. The students will also visit and encourage elderly residents in group and nursing homes.\\"http://libertyclassicalacademy.org/learning-to-lead/ Extracurriculars Julius Caesar The school offers visual arts and drama in every grade, highlighted at an Art & Drama Show at each school. In May 2008, the first graders presented Pinocchio Goes To School, in costume, with all lines memorized. The kindergarteners joined grades 2‚Äì3 in staging a 45-minute version of C.S. Lewis' The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. Grades 4‚Äì5 did The Taming of the Shrew in Shakespeare's original iambic pentameter. Middle school students put on Arabian Nights, grades 9‚Äì10 performed Knights of the Rad Table, and the juniors and seniors presented The Somewhat True Tale of Robin Hood. Music is an equally important part of life at Liberty. Choir is required through fourth grade and elective afterward, with the Cantamus Christi group (pictured above) open to grades 9‚Äì12 by audition. Band is offered at both the Upper and Lower Schools beginning in fourth grade. All music groups perform at the All-School Christmas Program in December, the Annual Band/Choir Concert, and Graduation. Liberty has a well stocked library, helped by a $10,000 award from retail chain Target that was the subject of a full-page ad in Newsweek magazine.Newsweek, October 24, 2005, p. 22a (2STP). The school's numerous social activities include field trips to museums, bowling excursions, Harvest Festival, literary \\"Character Day\\", hayrides, theater nights, ice skating, and an all-school day of skiing and snowboarding each February.http://www.libertyclassicalacademy.org/introducing_liberty/atmosphere/social_activities/ The Upper School has a Spring Formal, and the senior class goes on a retreat each fall. Athletics Liberty Lions baseball in action As of 2008-19, Liberty offers boys' teams in baseball (grades 4‚Äì12), basketball (4‚Äì12), track (6‚Äì12), and cross-country skiing (grades 9-12). Girls' sports include basketball (grades 4-12), volleyball (6‚Äì12), and track (6‚Äì12). The soccer teams (grades 6‚Äì8, and 9‚Äì12) are coed. Sports teams are continually being added as enrollment, participation, and parent volunteering increase. Liberty is a member school of the Minnesota State High School League for soccer, boys' basketball, baseball, and track. The middle and lower school teams participate in the St. Paul Catholic Athletic Association, where the middle school girls basketball team won the Class C Championship in 2008. Local homeschooled students are invited to join Liberty‚Äôs teams (PSEO excluded), providing these students an opportunity for organized sports they would not otherwise have, and helping to fill out the squads.

The dediticii existed as a class of persons who were neither slaves, nor Roman citizens (cives), nor Latini (that is, those holding Latin rights), at least as late as the time of Ulpian. The civil status of dediticii was analogous to the condition of a conquered people who did not individually lose their freedom, but as a community lost all political existence as the result of a deditio, an unconditional surrender.Christian Baldus, \\"Vestigia pacis. The Roman Peace Treaty: Structure or Event?\\" in Peace Treaties and International Law in European History from the Late Middle Ages to World War One (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 122. A person who became a subject of the Empire through a deditio (that is, a person who was a dediticius) was excluded from the universal citizenship extended to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire under the Constitutio Antoniniana.Olivier Hekster, Rome and Its Empire, AD 193‚Äì284 (Edinburgh University Press, 2008), p. 47. The Lex Aelia Sentia provided that, if a slave was put in bonds by his master as a punishment, or branded, or put to the torture for an offence and convicted, or delivered up to fight with wild beasts, or sent into a gladiatorial school (ludus), or put in confinement (custodia), and then manumitted either by his then owner, or by another owner, he merely acquired the status of a peregrinus dediticius, and had not even the privileges of the ius Latinum. The peregrini dediticii were those who, in former times, had taken up arms against the Roman people, and being conquered, had surrendered themselves. They were, in fact, a people who were absolutely subdued, and yielded unconditionally to the conquerors, and, of course, had no other relation to Rome than that of subjects. The form of deditio occurs in Livy. Dediticii who were former slaves were perceived as a threat to society, regardless of whether their master's punishments had been justified, and if they came within a hundred miles of Rome, they were subject to reenslavement.Jane F.

He was assassinated shortly after the beginning of the Dirty War‚Äîin mid-1974‚Äîand shortly before the military coup. Life and times David Kraiselburd was born into a working-class Ukrainian Jewish family in Berisso, an industrial city north of La Plata, Argentina, in 1912. In his teens, a high-school writing contest earned him an internship in La Plata's main daily, El D√≠a, after the end of which he was hired by the paper as a sports commentator. He enrolled in the prestigious University of La Plata, and, at the paper, he was promoted to university affairs correspondent. He was also involved in university politics‚Äîhe had anarchist sympathies, and had protested Sacco and Vanzetti's execution a few years earlier. After earning the equivalent of a JD degree from Law School, he became a representative of the alumni association (Graduados). To broaden his background, he re-enrolled in the university and earned another degree in History. Also in those early years, the paper sent him to Spain to cover the Spanish Civil War. Gradually, he rose up in the journalistic ranks and became a prominent figure within and outside the paper. El D√≠a's financial straits eventually led the heirs of its founding partners to sell part of their stake in the daily, and, in September 1961, Kraiselburd purchased a share of El D√≠a. The main owners of the daily became, thus, the Fascetto family (heirs of one of the founding partners) and Kraiselburd, although none had a controlling share (this partnership ended in 2010, with an agreement that gave the Fascetto family full control of Diario Popular, founded by Kraiselburd in 1974, while control of El D√≠a was given fully to the Kraiselburd family, especially his eldest son, Raul, who took up his father's post after his murder). Kraiselburd and El D√≠a in the face of the 1960s military coups and the political turmoil of the early 1970s Putting his legal background in action as director and editor-in-chief, Kraiselburd was among the few Argentine publishers to openly oppose the 1966 coup d'√©tat against the moderate, democratically elected President Arturo Illia. Kraiselburd denounced the imminent coup, and then refused to publish dictator Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a's inaugural address. Ongan√≠a's La Plata officials retaliated by confiscating that day's circulation and harassing the paper. El D√≠a's challenges were not mitigated by the March 1973 return to democracy. A decree signed by interim President Ra√∫l Lastiri sought to prohibit Argentine periodicals' access to international news agencies wires, in an attempt to limit them to wires published by Telam, the state news agency founded by Lastiri's benefactor, populist former President Juan Per√≥n. This measure amounted to a monopoly of news wires by the state agency, controlled by the government. Kraiselburd moved quickly, however, and, on his initiative, El D√≠a and numerous other Argentine dailies established a national news agency, Noticias Argentinas. He was named president of the agency while remaining at the helm of El D√≠a. Kraiselburd's murder during the 1974 \\"unofficial\\" beginning of the Dirty War Staunchly centrist, El D√≠a marshaled its \\"Page 4\\" editorial section, which had openly opposed the Ongania coup in the 60s, and that by early 1974 denounced the Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance (AAA), a right-wing paramilitary organization that was given free rein (and was supported by) the Ministry of Welfare in chasing down left-wing organizations. Naturally, the stronger left-wing organizations (i.e., the left-Peronist Montoneros) retaliated. Yet, by the same token, \\"El Dia\\" warned against the escalation of violence that was ensuing, as well as against the increasingly violent \\"politics\\" of both Left and Right. \\"Violence was the main medium of politics first, and politics later,\\" as researcher Pilar Calveiro succinctly said in regard to the process underwent by the left-wing Montoneros. Threatened by both the AAA and Montoneros, and although he was a more \\"fitting\\" target for the former, it was the latter organization the one which took action against the paper and its editor. Kraiselburd was kidnapped on June 25, 1974 by a Montoneros cell while the editor was walking toward the newspaper building. In a spree against dissenters, and prefiguring Kraiselburd's fate, on July 15 a Montoneros unit burst into a small-town restaurant and machine-gunned a frequent El Dia contributor, former Interior (law enforcement) Minister Arturo Mor Roig, who, under the military regime of Gen. Lanusse, had been instrumental in the transition toward democracy that led to two 1973 elections, which Peron's stand-in (Hector Campora) first, and Peron later, won by a landslide. Mor Roig was a well-known moderate democrat. He had knowingly sacrificed his political career when he accepted the position offered to him by Gen. Lanusse years earlier, for the sake of speeding up the transition toward democracy. Montoneros, however, emphasized that during Mor Roig's tenure, prominent political prisoners had been massacred in the course of (and even after) a partially successful escape attempt in a Patagonian prison. The massacre had been brutal, but it was known that Mor Roig had had no involvement whatsoever. Yet, on Montoneros' view, his past association with a military government, in addition to his 1974 El Dia critical articles, made him a suitable target. As many Montoneros acknowledged‚Äîmost remarkably, intelligence officer, journalist, and outstanding writer Rodolfo Walsh‚Äîthese \\"acts of individual terror,\\" as Walsh called them, would not only backfire, but make popular support dwindle. Kraiselburd would soon follow Mor Roig's fate. He was being held captive in a house in Gonnet, located between La Plata and Buenos Aires. Twenty odd days after the kidnapping, a neighbor called the police after noticing \\"suspicious activity\\" in the house next door. On July 17, 1974, a police unit was sent to investigate, and a shooting between the Montoneros cell and the police ensued. Outnumbered, the Montoneros shot Kraiselburd to death and fled the scene. In September 1975, Kraiselburd was posthumously awarded the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot prize by Columbia University's School of Journalism, for his defense of democratic values in the face of forms of authoritarianism of both right-wing and left-wing leanings. Kraiselburd's imprint after 1974. Kraiselburd, Jr. and El Dia during the 1976-1983 dictatorship After Kraiselburd's murder, his eldest son, Raul, took up his post. Under his direction, and following the lead of his father, El Dia continued its explicit plea for the adherence to consensus-building, democratic practices, and its equally explicit rejection of lawless, criminal murders and disappearances, increasingly effected with the support of the State apparatus (1975) and, after the coup (1976) with the full disposal of the State resources at the tip of the Armed Forces. Threats from right-wing paramilitary groups, bombs in the printing press, random machine-gun attacks on buildings and houses, and other intimidatory tactics were overshadowed by the kidnapping and murder of Raul's two-year-old son, named David, after his grandfather. Chalked up to the action of \\"run-of-the-mill\\" kidnappers in search for a ransom, the case of David Kraiselburd's homonymous grandson was never fully explained‚Äînor was the baby's body ever found. Despite sporadic anti-Semitic aspersions claiming the contrary, El D√≠a was, as media researcher Cesar Diaz put it in a book-length critical analysis of the printed media under the 1976-83 dictatorship, one of the few \\"non-partner\\" (no socios) newspapers, along with the better-known case of The Buenos Aires Heraldand a few others; that is, newspapers that didn't partake in the \\"gentleman's agreement\\" that the military regime had imposed. The \\"non-partners,\\" therefore, reported on disappearances and related crimes perpetrated by the regime. In this connection, both Robert Cox, from the Herald, and Raul Kraiselburd, from El Dia, were also awarded Columbia University's Moors Cabot Prize. Diaz's analysis of the media under the military regime, unusually virtuous in escaping the widespread polarization of accounts of the 1970s (and therefore advancing a critical stance, rather than an unqualified paean), hints that the example of the late David Kraiselburd strengthened the commitment of the journalists who risked their lives every day at the newsroom during the dark years of the juntas.

Caruso and co-directed by Caruso and Casper Andreas. The film follows a brief period in the lives of two young actors, one who is openly gay, the other closeted to his parents. The openly gay actor struggles with whether he should be sexually promiscuous or seek a life partner, while the closeted one wonders if he should come out to his conservative, religious parents. Throughout the film, there are a series of musical numbers with tap dancing angels, a re-telling of the Genesis story, protests from televangelists, and a deprogramming camp that tries to turn gay kids straight. By the end of the film, the characters realize that life would be better if they just accepted themselves the way they are. Plot Paul (Daniel Robinson) and Eddie (Joey Dudding) have just begun previews of an Off-Broadway musical titled Adam & Steve: Just the Way God Made 'Em. The movie follows both the storyline of the musical, and the lives of the two main leads. =Adam and Steve= After God expels Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, he decides to put a gay couple, Adam and Steve, in charge of Eden. Out of spite, Eve writes the Bible to teach the future generations to hate gays. Five thousand years later, Steve is reincarnated in a Christian household and sent to a conversion therapy camp, where he encounters Adam. They feel an instant connection and abandon the camp, accepting themselves as gay men. An angel appears to take them to New York City, where they find their families. God appears to confirm that they are \\"just the way he made 'em\\". Their families finally accept them, and God joins their souls forever. =Paul and Eddie= Paul's main conflict is seeking the ideal male partner, and Eddie finds that his religious upbringing conflicts with his homosexuality. Paul is falsely accused of being HIV- positive and his boyfriend dumps him. He becomes disenchanted about monogamy and tries being promiscuous and online dating, but he finds this lifestyle unsatisfying and finds out he craves a loving, stable relationship. He constantly bumps into Charles, a fan that has developed a crush for him. Eventually, Charles wins him over by visiting him at a karaoke bar and serenading him with a love song. Eddie is closeted to his conservative parents, but after they announce they will attend his opening night, he comes out to them to a chilly reaction. Despite feeling conflicted about Eddie's sexual orientation and the theme of the show, they decide to attend anyway. Watching the show they have a change of heart and come to accept the fact that Eddie is gay. At the end of the opening show, Charles presents Paul with flowers and they kiss, starting a relationship, and Eddie's parents make amends with him.

Cast includes theatre veterans, Liz McCartney, Jim Newman, Joey Dudding, Marty Thomas, Andre Ward, Daniel Robinson, Jeff Metzler, Brian Spitulnik, Josh Cruz, Lena Hall and Steve Hayes, and features the choreography of Shea Sullivan with songs written by Rick Crom. It was the first feature film for stage actors Daniel Robinson and Joey Dudding. The two leads were at first concerned with the manner in which sex scenes were to be handled in the film, with Robinson originally turning down the role. He is reported as stating, \\"It was a little too over the top for me. I wasn't comfortable with the sex scene[s] and the nudity. It was too nude and gay for me.\\" He expanded, \\"A huge reason why I didn't take the film in the first place was that I didn't want to be seen as a gay actor. Big Gay Musical was like putting a tattoo on my body.\\" He eventually decided the film was a good opportunity, and in looking back on the production, acknowledged that the sex scene \\"was harder to read than to do.\\" Another of his early concerns were fears about having his naked body exposed on film forever. Robinson and Dudding both offered that the most difficult aspect to their respective roles was portraying two different characters with different story lines and motivations within the same film. Critical response In speaking about the film, Variety wrote of one of the film's many segments, and made special note of one dealing with Genesis, by writing that \\"Seldom has blasphemy been so entertaining, and if only Caruso were capable of sustaining such wit (and energy, as agile lensing and editing keep things lively), the movie could have stuck to documenting his stage show.\\" They expanded on flaws by writing \\"subsequent numbers stall, with lame caricatures of Tammy Faye Bakker and long stretches at an ex-gay conversion camp offset by an eye-candy male cast parading about in hot pants and angel wings.\\" The added that to the film's credit, \\"the directors insisted on casting openly gay Broadway actors in all the key roles, trading the usual daytime-soap-caliber cast of equivalently low-budget, L.A.-produced gay fare for multitalents with real singing and dancing chops.\\" They concluded that the film was \\"more than adequate for festival and DVD consumption.\\" After Elton shared that the film's structure is \\"a little unusual\\" in that after the prologue the film opens with \\"a rather extended musical and dance number from a preview performance of a stage play, Adam & Steve Just the Way God Made Em, which tells the story of the Bible from a decidedly gay perspective.\\" They called the film \\"a surprisingly pleasant romp,\\" writing that \\"this little gay musical has what seems to be about two full months of flawless preview performances!\\" New York Cool reviewer Frank J. Avella wrote that his first response was negative, but when he read of the involvement of Casper Andreas in the project he became more interested in the film and learned, contrary to his original impression, \\"no one breaks into song without a good reason.\\" Avella made special note of how the storyline revolves around the players and cast of the stageplay Adam and Steve Just the Way God Made Them, a musical production within the film itself which presents the Genesis creation narrative from a gay perspective. He wrote \\"The film continuously and cleverly returns to the stage show, using it as a framing device of sorts\\" as a means to underscore the film's greater story of acceptance-of-self. In summarizing, the reviewer offered that \\"production values are terrific and the ensemble is, for the most part, admirable\\". He wrote that Daniel Robinson was \\"quite impressive\\" and his slut song \\"brings down the house\\", but expanded that Joey Dudding playing a \\"sweet and sensitive Eddie\\" truly moves the audience by giving an accurate portrayal of a guy on the cusp of coming out.

It was published by Arc System Works for WiiWare and Nintendo eShop in Japan, and by Namco Networks America Inc for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. Each game revolves around the adventures of a character named \\"Commander Video\\", and features \\"a crazy mix of 80s aesthetics and modern game design\\". The styles of the games range from pong-like, to platforming, and shooting. Each game in the series features a chiptune-inspired soundtrack, but a different style of rhythm-based gameplay in each. Most games in the series have few levels; Beat, Core, Void and Flux have only three levels each while Fate has six and Runner has 36. Most of the games feature levels lasting between 10 and 25 minutes to make up for having such few levels. The games also consists of 8 modes, Nether, Hyper, Mega, Super, Ultra, Extra, Giga, and Meta, which changes based on how well the player does. Each successive game adds a new mode, the highest being Mega in Beat, and Meta in Flux. Games =Bit.Trip Beat= Reminiscent of the classic video game Pong, Bit.Trip Beat (2009) involves players moving an onscreen paddle in order to bounce off waves of incoming blocks to the beat of the music. As the player progresses through the game, the patterns of blocks become increasingly complex, but players can judge how well they are doing through changes in the graphics and music. The game is played by tilting the Wii Remote to move the paddle, via stylus or circle pad on the 3DS, via touch on iOS devices, or via keyboard or mouse on PC. Bit.Trip Beat also features up to 4-player cooperative multiplayer. In October 2009, Gaijin Games released the soundtrack to Bit.Trip Beat as a digital download, first on CDBaby and then on other major music stores. The soundtrack features over 19 minutes of chiptunes from the game. On November 3, 2010, Bit.Trip Beat was released on the Steam platform for Windows and Mac. =Bit.Trip Core= The second game in the series, Bit.Trip Core (2009), continues the rhythm based gameplay of the series. The gameplay involves players taking control of a plus shape in the middle of the screen that can fire a laser beam in only four directions (up, down, left and right), with the objective being to destroy patterns of blocks that zoom across the screen. As with the first game, as the player progresses through the game the patterns of blocks become increasingly complex, with changes in the graphics and music occurring based on how well they play. In March 2010, Gaijin Games released the soundtrack to Bit.Trip Core as a digital download, first on CDBaby, and iTunes, then other major music stores. Despite featuring the same proportion of levels as Bit.Trip Beat, Core's soundtrack is substantially smaller, with less than 15 minutes of music. =Bit.Trip Void= Released in late 2009, Bit.Trip Void puts players in control of the \\"void\\", a black, pixelated circle, which players move around the screen with 8-directional control. The objective of the game is to grow the void by collecting black squares that appear, while also dodging white squares that reset the size of the void and cause the player to lose points. The size of the void can also be reset by the player without incurring point losses, which is often needed as the void grows to sizes making it difficult and/or impossible to dodge the white squares. Void features music by guest composer Nullsleep, and its levels are named after Sigmund Freud's three parts of the human psyche. The soundtrack to Bit.Trip Void was announced on May, 2010, and is now available on CDBaby, as well as through iTunes and Amazon. =Bit.Trip Runner= Bit.Trip Runner (2010) is the fourth installment of the Bit.Trip series. Runner features over 50 levels. The gameplay involves players controlling Commander Video and making him jump, slide, kick, and more through various obstacles in his path. The special guest band Anamanaguchi provides menu and credits music. Though it has over 50 levels, called Challenges, breaking the 3 level norm of the last games, these levels are divided evenly amongst 3 zones, called Levels, which each have their own distinct background and musical feel; each level houses twelve challenges, including a boss challenge. For every challenge (except boss challenges) there is a retro challenge awarded should the player collect all gold bars in the normal level. Each retro challenge is harder than the normal challenge and usually has more gold bars. The perfect completion of a retro challenge will award players with an exclamation point beside the stage and the word \\"PERFECT\\" beside the score in the scoreboard, but only if they have done everything \\"extra\\" (e.g., jumping on top of springboards that they do not need to in order to finish) in the challenge beforehand. Bit.Trip Runner won the 2011 Independent Games Festival (IGF) Excellence in Visual Arts award.IGF 2011 Independent Games Festival Winners On February 28, 2011 Bit.Trip Runner was released on the Steam platform for Windows and Mac. =Bit.Trip Fate= Bit.Trip Fate (2010) is the fifth installment of the series. It is a rhythm rail shooter, or shmup. It was formally announced on September the 4th, at the Penny Arcade Expo, in the Destructoid LIVE booth. It was released on WiiWare on October 25, 2010. The game sees Commander Video travelling across a set path, able to move anywhere along this path and shoot in any direction. By defeating enemies and collecting the items they drop, Commander Video can enhance his state, though it will drop if he is hit. Along the way, he can run into allies which temporarily give him special weapons. Among these characters are CommandGirl Video and Junior Melchkin from previous BIT.TRIP games, as well as cameo appearances by Super Meat Boy and Mr. Robotube, who are characters from other independent video games. It is the first video game to prominently feature dubstep music. =Bit.Trip Flux= Bit.Trip Flux (2011), the sixth game in the main series, returns to the gameplay of Bit.Trip Beat while combining elements from the other five games in the series, such as beats the player's paddle must avoid. As with the other games, changes in the graphics and music of the title reflect how well the player is doing, though there are multiple checkpoints in each level, unlike in Beat. Similar to Beat, Bit.Trip Flux also features two-player cooperative multiplayer. =Bit.Trip Presents... Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien= Bit.Trip Presents Runner2 (2013) is a spin-off and spiritual successor to Bit.Trip Runner. While having the same main character and play style, the game is only a non-canon side story in between Runner and Fate. This is the first game in the series to be released for Wii U, PS3 and Xbox 360. Unlike the previous Bit.Trip games, it is not 8 bit themed. =Bit.Trip Saga/Complete= The entire Bit.Trip series was released for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii in collections respectively titled Bit.Trip Saga and Bit.Trip Complete on September 13, 2011 in North America and March 16, 2012 in Europe. The 3DS version of the game has the six games redone in 3D and features new control schemes (for instance, stylus control via the touchscreen for Beat and Flux). The Wii version has 20 extra \\"challenge levels\\" for each game, as well as bonus content related to the production of the games. These levels are completely new but are shorter than the already included levels. Both compilations included a CD soundtrack called \\"Bit.Trip Soundtrack Sampler\\" featuring a number of tracks from each of the individual games. The soundtrack comes with every copy of Bit.Trip Complete, and was available as a pre-order bonus when purchasing Bit.Trip Saga from GameStop. =The Bit.Trip= A compilation of the first six games (up to Flux) for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. This collection was announced at the 2015 PlayStation Experience and was released later that day, December 5, 2015. This compilation added achievements, and retained the difficulty levels from Complete. =Runner3= Runner3 is a rhythm platformer video game developed by Choice Provisions. A sequel to Bit.Trip Presents... Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien, Runner3 is part of the Bit.Trip series, starring the character CommanderVideo. The game was released on May 22, 2018 on Windows, macOS, and Nintendo Switch, and it came for PlayStation 4 in November 2018, Xbox One will release later. Appearances in other media Since release Commander Video has made several appearances in video games outside of the Bit.Trip series, including as playable character in games such as Super Meat Boy, Indie Pogo, and UFHO2. He has also makes an appearance in Retro City Rampage, as a swimmer in Ridiculous Fishing and as a trophy in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. CommandGirl Video is a playable character in Woah Dave! which was created by the same developers that made the Bit.Trip series. Reception Throughout the series, the Bit.Trip games have enjoyed positive critical reception. IGN gave Bit.Trip Beat an 8/10, praising the presentation of the game but lamenting the lack of online leaderboards. Bit.Trip Runner won the 2011 Independent Games Festival (IGF) Excellence in Visual Arts award. Nintendo Power magazine gave a score of 9.0 out of 10. Marketing In order to promote the first game, a viral marketing campaign and alternate reality game was launched, revolving around the mystery surrounding the Commander Video character. The campaign revolved around internet videos and \\"missions\\" sent out by The Commander, which involved spreading word about the game, uncovering information about it and creating an English Wikipedia entry.

It was released in 2009 in North America, and released in Japan and PAL regions in the same year. It was later released for the Windows and Mac OS X through the download service Steam in 2010, while Namco Bandai published it for iOS on iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad in both Bit.Trip Beat and Bit.Trip Beat HD versions. Android and Linux versions debuted in the Humble Android Bundle 3. The WiiWare version is controlled by tilting the Wii Remote while holding it on its side. Players are placed in control of a paddle on the left side of the screen which, much like Pong, is tasked with deflecting squares that are coming from the right side. Each successful hit creates a sound effect that contributes to the background music, which was composed by an anonymous composer at Petrified Productions. A soundtrack was eventually released for the game's music, including some songs by micromusican Bit Shifter who composed the Title Screen and Credits music. Since its release, Bit.Trip Beat received generally positive reception, holding an 80 and 80.15% from Metacritic and GameRankings, respectively. Wired named it the fifth best Wii game of 2009, while IGN named it the eighth best WiiWare game. The most common praise for it was what multiple reviewers describe as addictive gameplay, stylish visuals, and a great soundtrack. However, certain reviewers criticized its short game length and high level of difficulty. It has spawned five sequels since, including Bit.Trip Core, Bit.Trip Void, Bit.Trip Runner, Bit.Trip Fate, and Bit.Trip Flux; with the exception of Flux, which plays as a reversed version of Beat, each game has a unique gameplay style to the last. Gameplay Several scenes of gameplay from Bit.Trip Beat. The player controls the paddle on the left while projectiles approach from the right in varying patterns. The score and its multiplier are shown on the top and bottom left of the screen. Bit.Trip Beat puts players in control of a paddle that reflects differently sized and coloured beats, similar to Pong, as they come from the right side of the screen toward the left. It is controlled by holding the Wii Remote sideways and tilting it toward and away from the player to make the paddle go up and down. Gameplay takes place in one of three different phases: Transition, Descent, and Growth, with each phase more difficult than the last. Before each phase a cutscene of the character Commander Video is shown. Phases are split into several parts, with each part ending with multiple rainbow-coloured beats. At the end of each phase is a boss. Either through getting a game over or beating the phase, players will then have their final scores tallied. When the beats collide with the paddle, they make a noise, contributing to the background music. Each successful deflection earns players a set score. Beats may also move in strange patterns, such as beats that bounce back after being deflected or beats that pause for a moment. If the paddle misses a beat, it will deplete a meter on the lower screen slightly; if the meter is completely depleted, the background will change to black and the beats and paddle white. If the meter depletes again, players will lose and have to start the phase over. In order to get out of this, players must fill up a meter at the top of the screen before the lower meter empties again, bringing them to normal. If players fill it up again, it will bring them into a new style, where the music, graphics, and sound effects are changed, with the score per each successful deflection doubled. Each time the meter is filled up at this point, the score multiplier increases. Special beats will, if hit, modify players' paddle temporarily in some way; some will make the paddle tiny, rewarding players for meeting a threshold of beats hit while in this form, or doubling paddles to prepare players for a sequence of beats that cannot be hit without two paddles. If the lower meter empties on this screen, players will return to the normal mode. Bit.Trip Beat also features a multi-player mode, allowing anywhere from two to four players to play cooperatively, all paddles working together to deflect the beats. The four player mode modifies the paddles to make them smaller to prevent the game from becoming too easy. The iOS release of Bit.Trip Beat has several new features. This includes leaderboards, downloadable levels based on other titles in the Bit.Trip series, achievements, and the ability to either use the built-in accelerometer or the iOS series' touch screens. Its multi-player mode allows for both off and online multi-player. Similar to the iOS version, the Windows and Mac OS X versions feature leaderboards and achievements. This version adds an easy mode and the ability to post high score data to either Facebook or Twitter. Development and release Bit.Trip Beat was developed by Gaijin Games and initially published by Aksys Games. It was designed by Alex Neuse, its art by Mike Roush, and its programming by Chris Osborn. Their publishing agreement with Aksys was formed due to Neuse's personal relationship with its president, Akibo Shieh, with whom the two of them had wanted to work on a game together before. Despite the amicable relationship with Aksys, the budget and development time were less than they would have wanted, though they put up with it due to their good relationship and the challenge of developing with those limits. Because of being only three people, the developers had to do more than what they normally would have to. Before its reveal, Gaijin released a teaser on IGN. Its title was originally 8-Bit Beat, though this was changed to Bit.Trip Beat. Early on, the developers could only afford one development kit, causing them to have to interrupt each other's work to use it. One of the first ideas made for the game was to give it an Atari 2600 art style. It was initially proposed as \\"Pong with music\\". While described as being \\"not a big selling point\\" by Roush, the enthusiasm given off by Neuse convinced him to stay and work with him on it. Roush attributes the development of Bit.Trip Beat on WiiWare over competing services Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network due to both coming off from the development of a Nintendo DS game before it and Neuse's Nintendo fanboyism. Its development time spanned three and a half months. He explains that it was easier to switch from the DS to Wii than it would be to switch to an entirely different company's platform. Neuse noted music video game Rez for inspiring Beat, calling it one of his favourite games of all time. The developers designed its controls with the intent of hearkening back to the era of \\"spinner controls\\" traditionally used in paddle games. Initially, they used several different kinds of controls, including having players control it with the d-pad, the analog stick, and by pointing the Wii Remote at the screen. However, they eventually settled on holding the controller sideways and tilting it. Boss battles were added near the end of development; while Neuse did not want to feature them despite his love for the video game trope, he felt that the game could benefit from them. However, due to the short time spent creating them, he finds them to feel rushed, even though they add to the game. Neuse explains that, while wanting the game to remain open to interpretation, Beat shows CommanderVideo's journey from the ethereal to the corporeal, ending with CommanderVideo becoming aware of himself and saying \\"I am only a man.\\" Near the end of development, the developers realized that they had mistakenly forgotten to localize the game, including error messages, such as those telling if save data has been corrupted. As such, they believe that they diminished its accessibility in other regions as a result. A bug, interpreted to be intentional, prevented the game from saving unless players achieve a high score. This only affected the North American version, as the other versions came out after it was fixed. A traditional patch was not easily accomplished on the WiiWare service, which Game Set Watch speculates drove them to their method of fixing it, which included putting up two save files that included high scores for the first two levels, thereby unlocking the third level. =Audio= Originally, the audio was intended to be entirely chiptune; however, they realized that they should make the music more appealing to more people, making them change the style to simply chiptune- inspired. They outsourced the music to noted micromusician Bit Shifter. Bit.Shifter used Atari 2600 and Nintendo Entertainment System samples to compose the songs. Gaijin Games released the soundtrack for Bit.Trip Beat, which contains ten songs. While given a limited release initially, it was eventually given wide release on services such as Amazon MP3, iTunes, eMusic, and others. =Promotion and release= It was published by Aksys Games for the WiiWare on March 16, 2009 in North America and May 1, 2009 in PAL regions. Arc System Works published it in Japan on April 28, 2009. It was released for iOS in North America on September 30, 2010, where it was published by Namco Bandai. The iOS release was accompanied by an HD version of it for the same platform. Aksys also published it for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X through the Steam service on November 2, 2010 in North America. Because they had no money for marketing, they launched a viral marketing campaign, which consisted of the above-mentioned teaser video, screenshots, and a CommanderVideo web site, all of which were well-received; however, according to Neuse, the hype for the game died down too far before the game's release, which he feels hurt its sales potential. While a release for the Xbox 360's Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation 3's PlayStation Network has been mentioned as possible in the future by the creators, they noted that it was difficult to accomplish. Artist Mike Terpstra created two posters for the game, depicting Commander Video standing above a city. Bit.Trip Beat has been featured as part of a series of videos made by Nintendo called \\"Developer's Voice\\", which shares \\"in-game footage and insight who worked on the title\\". After the release of the first demo of Bit.Trip Beat for WiiWare, Gaijin Games CEO Alex Neuse claimed that the demo brought sales of the game up to their initial projections, later claiming that it needs to be played for players to understand it. A demo was released for the iOS version titled Bit.Trip Beat Blitz. During a Steam sale, Bit.Trip Beat was sold in the Indie Pulse Pack for $5.00, which included Audiosurf, Beat Hazard, Rhythm Zone, and The Polynomial.http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2010/11/steams_indie_pulse_pack_five_i.html It was released on sale for $1.99 for the iOS launch. For Halloween in 2010, Namco Bandai dropped the prices of both Bit.Trip Beat and Bit.Trip Beat HD to $0.99 each on the iOS. The Windows and Mac OS X versions of Bit.Trip Beat were available for 10% off of $9.99 for the first week of its release. Reception =Pre-release= Ars Technica's Ben Kuchera noted it for being a quality title on the WiiWare service, which he states has been lacking in quality titles. He praised the trailer as exciting, while anticipating that it will be a \\"joy to play.\\" Kotaku's Mike Fahey commented that it looked like a \\"blast to play.\\" IGN's Steve Butts commented that while its combination of Pong-like gameplay and rhythmic gameplay could result in people referring to it as \\"Pong Pong Revolution\\", it was hard not to be \\"captivated, tested and utterly exhausted\\" by it. =WiiWare release= Pong was commonly cited by both the developers and critics as an inspiration for Bit.Trip Beat. Since its release for WiiWare, Bit.Trip Beat has received generally positive reception, holding aggregate scores of 80/100 and 80.15% on Metacritic and GameRankings, respectively. GameSpot's Lark Anderson praised it for its addictiveness, music, and visuals; however, he criticized the number of levels, lack of online leaderboards, and for a confusing premise. Destructoid's Jonathan Holmes called it one of his favourite games of 2009. IGN's Mark Bozon described the gameplay as basic, but fun. He also praised the aesthetic quality of the game, describing the music as \\"extremely well-composed and complex\\" and the graphics for successfully achieving an old school style with its visuals. He also named it one of the 15 best WiiWare games. Wireds Gus Mastrapa named it his fifth favourite Wii game of 2009, calling it \\"one of the biggest surprises of the year\\", calling it \\"hard as hell\\". It was well received by Official Nintendo Magazines Simon Bramble, who described it as a \\"fresh take on Pong\\" and praising its value and aesthetics. However, he noted its few levels left them wanting, even though they were large and unique. Edge called it \\"short and difficult\\", though praising the developers for its use of \\"rhythm and conditioning to such powerful effect.\\" They also noted that the game could have improved if the three levels were broken up into several more smaller segments. In MTV Multiplayer's review of one of its sequels Bit.Trip Flux, editor Jason Cipriano noted that while good, it was too difficult. Eurogamer's Simon Parkin described it as a \\"brisk, radiant creation\\" as well as a \\"nostalgic celebration\\". However, he did feel that Gaijin was \\"struggling\\" to come up with ways to increase the difficulty by the third phase, citing a unique type of beat that obscured the screen to an extent with their \\"flair\\". NGamer's Nick Ellis called it a \\"superb reinvention of Pong\\" and \\"unashamedly retro\\". While also praising the music and addictiveness, they criticized its high level of difficulty and eye strain that it may cause. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas named it the eighth best WiiWare game, noting the fact that Pong creator Ralph Baer had played Bit.Trip Beat as evidence of its quality. He also compared it to Nintendo's Art Style series, calling it addictive and a good value, but also brief. IGN also featured it as a part of their \\"WiiWare Showcase\\" series, describing it as a \\"quick trip to a catchy musical game.\\" Authors Jeff and Steve Fulton noted Bit.Trip Beat as a good example of a \\"post-retro game\\". They later note that it isn't appropriate to call it Pong, as while it shares some elements, it is very different. They also noted that, sans the visual and audio enhancements, it succeeds as a post-retro game as being an idea that could have been accomplished on the Atari 2600, but with the rhythmic premise, would make it impossible back in the day. Bit.Trip Beat was awarded with \\"The Michael Jackson Award for Best Video Game Music\\" by PC World, praising the game's use of sound effects to enhance the music. By the first half of 2009, Destructoid's Chad Concelmo named Bit.Trip Beat one of the best games of the year, as well as four other Destructoid editors. =Later releases= The PC version has received fairly positive reception as well. Gamezebo described it as a combination of Pong and Guitar Hero, commenting that the combination of Pong-like gameplay and rhythmic gameplay usually \\"works beautifully\\". While describing its gameplay as \\"simple yet addictive\\" and its aesthetics as \\"primitive yet beautiful\\", they criticized the game length, high difficulty level, and a lack of multi- player. They also noted that the Wii version was superior. Indie Games' Tim W. featured the Windows and Mac OS X versions as part of the web site's Best Of Indie Games feature. Fellow Indie Games editor Michael Rose strongly suggested buying it, describing it as a \\"far more insane\\" version of Pong. However, he did criticize it for having few, long levels that could be difficult for people who have difficulty keeping focus. Mobile gaming developer Zach Cage called Bit.Trip Beat one of his favourite games released in the past 10 years. IGN's Charles Onyett called it \\"fluid and creative\\", though deriding its high level of difficulty. He praised the game for its aesthetics, calling the music \\"catchy\\" and the visuals \\"irresistible\\" to long-time gamers, though feeling that the graphics can get distracting at times. He also praised the developers for the inclusion of online leaderboards. GamesRadar's Andrew Hayward praised the premise of the game as well as the iOS' touch controls. He also named it one of the 50 best iPad games of 2010. Gamezebo praised the iOS version for its aesthetics and gameplay and criticized it for its difficulty like they did with the Steam version; however, while it features the multi-player mode that they criticized the computer version for lacking, they criticized it for its \\"chaotic\\" nature and connection issues. IGN's Levi Buchanan found that while it was aesthetically pleasing and fun, it was too difficult. Adrenaline Vault's Michael Smith recommended that iOS device owners buy it, citing quality gameplay, graphics, and music, the latter two he says are good even if certain players do not like 8-bit. While he typically advises readers to \\"try before you buy\\" when buying a $5 iOS game, he cites Bit.Trip Beat as an exception. Ars Technica's Ben Kuchera called the iOS version \\"near perfect\\". He described its \\"rhythm game meets Pong\\" style as working well on the platform. GamePros Ryan Rigney featured it as one of their App Store Games of the Week of October 1, 2010. They called it a combination of music video game Audiosurf and Pong, praising Gaijin Games for mixing the old with the new. UGO Networks' Jason Cipriano called it addictive in their article on iOS games with achievements. Wireds John Mix Meyer listed it as one of the iPad's \\"10 Biggest, Baddest Games\\", commenting that while alone its elements were not strong enough to make a game, combined they are great. It was nominated for the Excellence in Audio award at the Independent Games Festival in 2010; it ultimately lost to Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Game Set Watch's Eric Caoili speculated that if Bit.Trip Beat is successful on the iOS platforms, that Namco Bandai may publish more of them. =Legacy= Bit.Trip Beat was the first in a series of six titles. It was followed by Bit.Trip Core, which uses the d-pad to control the gameplay instead of motion controls. The third game in the series is titled Bit.Trip Void, which puts players in control of an 8-bit ball. The fourth game is titled Bit.Trip Runner, the first game to put players in direct control of CommanderVideo. The fifth game in the series is titled Bit.Trip Fate, a side-scrolling on-rails shooter that again puts players in direct control of Commander Video. The final game in the series, Bit.Trip Flux, features similar mechanics and ideas to Beat, including featuring the same guest musician and its Pong-like gameplay. The developer attributes the return to this gameplay mechanic as Commander Video returning to \\"his simplest energetic state\\". However, it was designed to be easier than its predecessor, with no Game Over possible. Android Compatibility Issue On Android systems running Android Marshmallow or higher, Bit.Trip Beat freezes upon opening. The Android app has not been updated since 2012, and the Bit.Trip Beat Android support email address has stopped responding.

Hackleman was born in Franklin County, in 1814. He married Sarah Bradburn in 1833 and began his life as a farmer. He studied law and eventually passed the bar and began practicing law. From 1837-1841 he served as probate judge of Rush County, Indiana. In 1840 he became editor of the Rushville Republican until the war. In 1841 he was elected to the Indiana State Legislature and served as a delegate to the National Republican Convention in Chicago which elected Abraham Lincoln as the Republican presidential candidate. On May 20, 1861, when the Civil War began, Indiana Governor Oliver P. Morton appointed Hackleman colonel of the 16th Indiana Volunteer Infantry of one-year volunteers. Hackleman and the 16th Indiana were sent to the Eastern Theater where they were engaged at the Battle of Ball's Bluff. On April 28, 1862 he was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers and ordered to report to Ulysses S. Grant in the Western Theater. Hackleman was assigned to command the 1st Brigade in the 2nd Division of the Army of the Tennessee. The 2nd Division, led by Thomas A. Davies, was temporarily attached to William S. Rosecrans' Army of the Mississippi stationed around Corinth, Mississippi. On October 3, the Confederate Army attacked Rosecrans. Early in the fighting the Confederates forced a gap between Davies and General Thomas J. McKean's divisions and the Union line began to fall back. At this point in the battle Hackleman attempted to rally his brigade and was shot through the neck. He was taken to the Tishomingo Hotel in Corinth where he lay dying from the mortal wound. His final words were: \\"I am dying, but I die for my country\\". His body was returned to his home in Rushville where he was buried. He was the only Indiana general to be killed in battle during the Civil War. Hackleman is the namesake of the rural community of Hackleman, Indiana.

Early life McCoy was born in El Segundo, California in August 1915. He spent the first six years of his life there while his dad worked at the oil refineries in the area. He first visited the eastern Sierra Nevada when he was 13, and went on to make his own first pair of skis in a high school shop class. After finishing the eighth grade, he moved to Washington state to live with his grandparents because his parents divorced. There he met some Norwegian ski jumpers who further sparked Dave's interest in skiing. Right after graduating from high school, he moved to the tiny town of Independence, California. Two years later, he moved a few miles north to Bishop. In 1936, McCoy took a job as a hydrographer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which involved skiing up to 50 miles per day. While being a hydrographer, he joined the Eastern Sierra Ski Club. At age 22, he became the California State Champion in skiing. In 1938, McCoy got a permit and set up a primitive rope tow on McGee Mountain, near US Highway 395, using parts from a Model \\"A\\" Ford truck. He went to a bank, seeking an $85 loan to set up a permanent rope tow. The bank initially turned him down, but the bank's secretary, Roma (his future wife), urged the bank to make the loan. A few years later, McCoy married Roma. By the early 1940s, the climate started to warm up, however, and the snowfall on McGee Mountain was not as heavy as it had once been. It was suddenly not an ideal location for skiing anymore. Remnants of McCoy's original rope-tow can be spotted, and the site is marked with a historical marker sign along the current Highway 395. Mammoth Mountain McCoy noticed that the snow was better at Mammoth Mountain, where he set up a rope tow in 1942. The Forest Service decided then to offer, for bid, the right to operate a ski area on Mammoth Mountain. No one bid on this permit, including McCoy, who didn't have any money. In 1953, the Forest Service gave McCoy the permit on the condition that he develop the mountain as a ski resort. A ski lodge followed in 1953, and the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area incorporated in 1955. McCoy struggled to develop Mammoth. The \\"lodge\\" was actually only 12' by 24', had a dirt floor with an outside toilet, and served snacks. The McCoy family used it as a home during the early years of Mammoth. McCoy went to the bank again for a loan of $135,000 to build a chair lift. Again, he was turned down. McCoy eventually got a used chairlift. McCoy and a small group of skiers had to work very hard and dig holes, mix concrete, and install the lift on their own by Thanksgiving 1955. Chair 1 had a wooden ramp, covered with snow, that skiers had to side- step up to reach the chairs. Sometimes skiers would lose their balance and cause several of the skiers in line below to topple over like dominoes. The ramp was removed sometime in 1980s and a new high-speed Chair 1 was installed and renamed \\"Broadway Express.\\" The original main lodge was expanded and to this day, the upper part of the old exterior rock wall mural, with a white and brown flagstone arrow and skier, can be seen. By 1973, under McCoy's leadership, the ski area grew to 14 double-chairs, and a second base lodge originally named Warming Hut II was built. It was renamed Canyon Lodge in the mid 1990s. The Mid-chalet lodge was also renamed McCoy. A cafeteria/bar named the Mill Cafe was built by Chair 2 in the early 2000s, and a portable building named Eagle Lodge with clothes, a bar, and snacks on the left side of the mountain was added as well. McCoy bought a small airline to fly a few skiers from Burbank, California to Mammoth. The growth of the ski area led to growth of the town of Mammoth Lakes, California, which incorporated in 1984. In the 1990s, Alpha Airlines briefly flew from Los Angeles to the small Mammoth Airport along Highway 395. In the first decade of the 2000s, Horizon Airlines, began to offer seasonal service from Los Angeles, Reno, and the San Francisco Bay Area to Mammoth. McCoy faced adversity in growing the ski area: drought in 1958-59, the 1973 oil crisis, and only 94\\" inches of snow during the 1976-1977 season, the worst in Mammoth's history. Retirement In 2005, McCoy announced that he was retiring after running the ski area for 68 years. Mammoth Mountain Ski Area was sold to Starwood Capital Group in a deal that valued Mammoth at $365 million-a far cry from the $135,000 he borrowed in 1953 to build the first lift. He continued to ski until 2008, but stopped due to a knee replacement and his age. McCoy took up photography as well. As of 2018, Dave and Roma McCoy had 6 children, 17 grandchildren, 28 great-grandchildren, and 1 great-great-grandchild, a total of 52 descendants. McCoy turned 100 on August 24, 2015 and ‚Äúdied peacefully in his sleep‚Äù on February 8, 2020 at his home in the eastern Sierra Nevada community of Bishop, California at the age of 104. In popular culture He was portrayed by Dabney Coleman in the 1975 film The Other Side of the Mountain.

In 1996 Tiger Cup, Zainal Abidin was awarded as the MVP of the tournament. Three years later he was awarded the AFC Century Award.http://chedinsphere.blogspot.com/2013/02/anugerah-kelab-satu-abad- afc-1999-11hb.html He also played for Malaysia national futsal team, and was in the squad that took part in the 1996 FIFA Futsal World Championship in Spain.https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=106/edition=7184/teams/team=1890410.html Coaching career He retired from football in 1999 and selected to coach the Malaysian youth in 2001. In 2002, he selected as the assistant coach for Malaysia senior team. He later coached Pahang FA and brought them their first Malaysia Super League title. In 2006, he guided Pahang FA to win the Malaysian FA Cup. After the contract with Pahang FA ended, he reunites with his former striker partner Dollah Salleh. This time they act as manager-coach combination for Kuantan Port-Shahzan Muda FC.

In 2016, Zainal Abidin made his return to Selangor as head coach, replacing Mehmet Durakovic.

The estate is positioned in a gap north of Newport, where the road having crossed the marshland, clings to a steep slope of the Scaur above the meadowlands of the River Meese, where it meets Lonco Brook, before widening out onto the north Shropshire plan. The estate can trace its long history back to the Domesday records, which record a mill and two fisheries. Chetwynd was an important manor in Saxon times and was held by Leofric, Earl of Mercia, about 1050 though the current building was built in 1964 after the demolition of the older building. In 1318 Sir John de Chetwynd was granted the right to hold a market and three-day fair on All Souls Day. (2 November). From the 15th to the later 18th century Chetwynd was held by the Pigotts, whom the town's ghost story is about, namely Madam Pigott. The last of them, Robert, High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1774, sold the estate and moved to Geneva, where he died in 1794. Mrs Burton Borough of Chestwynd Park c.1850s. Wife of J.C.B. Borough The estate was then purchased by Thomas Borrow, member of a Derbyshire iron-founding family, who subsequently changed his name to Borough. Thomas, who moved to Chetwynd in 1803, was succeeded by his son John Charles Burton Borough, High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1844. In the 1860s there was a major building campaign carried out by J.C.B. Borough. Chetwynd Hall was reworked as Chetwynd Park, and at the same time the church and rectory which stood in the grounds (the church just beside the hall) were demolished and replaced by new structures 250 metres to the southwest. Terraced lawns were laid out on the site of the old church, new gardens were designed, and the park was enlarged. As the estate declined in the 20th century, Chetwynd Hall was demolished and replaced by a modern house in the 1960s. Next to the Hall lies the Church and a school house both built to replace earlier ones in 1924. The school itself was moved from next to the hall to next to the gate house, to respect the privacy of the owners, and it covered Chetwynd and Sambrook from 1857 until 1959 when it became the village hall The grounds of the hall have been cut down over the years with a quarter going to become Newport original show ground. Following the purchase of the Deer Park by Newport and District Agricultural Society, the old show ground was leased to Newport (Salop) Rugby Union Football Club, with another two quarters became the modern show ground at Chetwynd park or Deer park which is sited on the banks of Chetwynd Pool, which is a pool. The Deer Park got its name from the herd of some 100 fallow deer which were brought up from Southern England, and is set up much like a Medieval deer park. Following the death of the life tenant, Mrs M Borough, in 1987, the Estate was left to Oxford University and Charterhouse School and in 1988, the whole of the estate was sold, with the Deer Park being bought by Newport & District Agricultural Society, who run the Newport Show. The society set about the task of restoring the Park to its former glory and at the same time, creating what is acknowledged to be one of the most beautiful show grounds in the country. In addition, the society has developed the educational potential of the deer park by building a classroom facility known as The Lodge in 2013 and as a result, many local schools and community groups as well as Harper Adams University visit the deer park for educational purposes.

During the War of 1812, it served as an important source of saltpeter, a vital component of gunpowder. Robert Baker discovered the cave in the late eighteenth century.Kleber p.387 A stream ran through the cave, and was wide enough so that oxcarts could be used to bring the saltpeter above ground. However, torchlights had to be used to light the cave so that workers could mine the saltpeter from the ground.Walker p.36 At the cave, calcium nitrate, also called niter, is leached from dry soil. When Doctor Samuel Brown, a Transylvania University professor of anatomy, chemistry, and surgery, gave in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1806 the first scientific description of Kentucky's saltpeter production, he drew mainly from the experiences of the Great Saltpetre Cave.Kleber p.794 As with most saltpeter caves, the land above the cave is a hardwood forest-covered plateau. Typically the saltpeter would be sent to Lexington, Kentucky to be made into gunpowder.Gruenwald p.93 During the War of 1812, sixty to seventy men were employed to mine the cave of its saltpeter, deemed necessary as British blockades prevented saltpeter shipments from overseas. Many of the workers at the cave were slaves.Walker p.34 To a lesser degree the cave was also mined during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the American Civil War. During the later war, the Union soldiers that worked at the cave also lived in the cave, due to its year-around temperature giving respite from cold winters and hot summers. For a time, ending in the 1970s, Great Saltpetre Cave was a commercial cave, and was open not only for tours, but also for ballroom dances, a museum, and weddings. However, the guests would often damage the cave formations by taking souvenirs. Some would also leave their names in the cave, the most notable of which was Daniel Boone. Today the cave is owned by the Rockcastle Karst Conservancy, as part of the Great Saltpetre Preserve, off Kentucky State Route 1004. Overnight camping stays are possible upon request if the requester belongs to certain organizations. Artifacts from the cave's mining days are still visible at the site. The 1997 Steven Seagal film Fire Down Below was partially filmed at the cave.

On 15 August 1948, on the occasion of the first anniversary of India's Independence Day, Gandhi was honored as the first Indian to be depicted on stamps of India. A set of 100 of these stamps was overprinted with the word \\"Service\\" and provided only to the Governor General of India for his official use. The 10 Rupees \\"Service\\" overprinted stamp is one of India's rarest and most highly valued stamps. History The original plan was to issue a set of stamps depicting Mahatma Gandhi (\\"Bapu\\", or \\"father\\" in Hindi), in January 1948. The India Security Press in Nashik was entrusted with the task of producing a set of 4 stamps. But before the stamps were issued, Gandhi was assassinated. The Indian Government decided to print these stamps as a memorial, using photogravure press, and hence had to employ the services of the Swiss printers, Helio Courvoisier, Sa. LaChaux De Fonds, instead of the India Security Press. The word \\"Bapu\\" was printed on the stamp in Hindi and Urdu languages as a symbol of communal harmony. Four stamps with denominations 1.5 annas, 3.5 annas, 12 annas and 10 rupees were issued. One of the stamps of the set was issued with a very high price of 10 Rs., out of reach of the common populace in India. The stamps were issued on 15 August 1948, on the occasion of the first anniversary of India's Independence Day. Technical details Photo of the Sheet of 10 Rupees Mahatma Gandhi Stamp Overprinted Service, which was exhibited at International Philately Exhibition Indipex 2011 at New Delhi, India The 10 Rs. stamp depicted Bapu in a grey colour with a reddish-brown background. A total of 250,000 stamps were printed in sheets of 50 stamps, 5 rows of 10 stamps each, with a perforation of 11.5 mm. Forgeries of both the stamps, and of and first day covers bearing them, are known. Service issue A set of stamps over-printed as \\"Service\\" was issued to the Government of India for official purposes. Only 100 Mahatma Gandhi 10 Rs. stamps were overprinted with \\"Service\\" and issued for the use of C. Rajagopalachari, the Governor General of India, making it the world's least printed stamp. Of the hundred stamps that were overprinted with \\"Service\\", a few were given to dignitaries, while most, including an intact sheet of 50, remain at the National Archives, Postal Museums, etc. The 2006 book by Dr. Reuben Ramkissoon and Dr. Rajagopalan reports that less than 8 copies of the Gandhi 10 Rs Service stamps reside in private hands.

It was the only newspaper delivered to the West Coast on the first ride of the Pony Express in 1860. History The newspaper was founded in 1845 by William Ridenbaugh (1821‚Äì1874)http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mobuchan/RidenbaughJohnFAncestors.pdf two years after Joseph Robidoux founded St. Joseph and just a few years after the Platte Purchase had opened the former Indian Territory for settlement.

One of its editors was Alexander Russell Webb. In the 1850s and early 1860s, the paper went through a new series of owners, including P.S. Pfouts and J.H.R. Cundiff. In 1857, it switched from a weekly to a daily. On April 3, 1860, the newspaper sent on the Pony Express read: :Through the politeness of the Epxress Company, we are permitted to forward by the first Pony Epxress, the first and only newspaper which goes out, and which will be the first paper ever transmitted from the Missouri to California in eight days.

After the war the newly renamed St. Joseph Daily Gazette was taken over again by Ridenbaugh. After Riddenbaugh's death, it was sold to a consortium from New York City led by W.E. Smedley. Eugene Field edited the paper in 1874 and 1875 and was to marry a St. Joseph girl during the time. On Wednesday April 5th, 1882, one of its most famous headlines was \\"JESSE, BY JEHOVAH\\" as it announced the death of Jesse James in the community. John N. Edwards, who had popularized the Jesse James as anti-hero myth, edited the paper during the trials of Frank James in the late 1880s. Chris L. Rutt was working at the Gazette when he invented and trademarked Aunt Jemima ready-mix pancake mix. Unable to make it profitable he sold the trademark and recipe to the Davis Milling Company which turned it into a national phenomenon. In 1896, it was operated by Charles F. Cochran. In 1924, Clyde Robert Bulla was among 100 third-place winners in a contest on the theme \\"A Grain of Wheat.\\"St. Joseph News-Press: 150 years of St. Joseph News by Preston Filbert - News-Press & Gazette Co (1995) Charles M.

The principal fighting occurred between the Bolshevik Red Army and the forces of the White Army, a group of loosely allied anti-Bolshevik forces. During the war several foreign armies took part, mostly fighting against the Red Army‚Äîincluding the Western allies‚Äîand many foreign volunteers fought for both sides. Other nationalist and regional political groups also participated in the war, including the Ukrainian nationalist Green Army, the Ukrainian anarchist Black Army and Black Guards, and warlords such as Ungern von Sternberg. Despite some pressure from Britain, the Australian Prime Minister, William Hughes, had refused to commit forces to Russia following the end of World War I in 1918. Although no Australian units were engaged in operations, many individuals did become involved through service with the British Army during the North Russia Campaign. They served in many roles, including as advisors to White Russian units as part of the North Russian Expeditionary Force (NREF). About 150 men of the Australian Imperial Force who were still in England awaiting repatriation following the end of World War I enlisted as infantry in the North Russia Relief Force (NRRF), where they were involved in several sharp battles. The Royal Australian Navy was also involved, the destroyer HMAS Swan being briefly engaged in an intelligence-gathering mission in the Black Sea in late 1918 on behalf of the British military mission then advising the White Russian general, Anton Denikin. Several Australians acted as advisers to this mission as well, and others served as advisers with Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia. Later, another small group of Australian volunteers served on operations in Mesopotamia as part of Dunsterforce and the Malleson Mission, although these missions were mainly aimed at preventing Turkish access to the Middle East and India, and the men did little fighting. Background In 1917, Russia had been in political turmoil with support for the war and the Tsar dwindling. Under intense pressure Tsar Nicholas II abdicated in March and a provisional government formed under Alexander Kerensky, pledging to continue fighting the Germans on the Eastern Front. The Western allies had been shipping supplies to Russia since the beginning of the war, through the ports of Archangel, Murmansk and Vladivostok. Following the entry of the United States into World War I in 1917, the Americans also began providing support. Political and social unrest increased, and the revolutionary Bolsheviks gained widespread support. During the July Offensive, the Russian Army was soundly defeated by the German and Austro-Hungarians, leading to the collapse of the Eastern Front. The Russian Army was on the verge of mutiny and most soldiers had deserted the front lines. Kerensky's government was overthrown in October 1917, and the Bolsheviks assumed power. The Russian Civil War began in the wake of the collapse of the provisional government. The principal fighting occurred between the Bolshevik Red Army and the forces of the White Army, being a group of loosely allied anti-Bolshevik forces. Foreign armies also took part, mostly fighting against the Red Army, and many foreign volunteers fought for both sides. Other nationalist and regional political groups also participated in the war, including the Ukrainian nationalist Green Army, the Ukrainian anarchist Black Army and Black Guards, and warlords such as Ungern von Sternberg. Meanwhile, on 2 December 1917 an armistice was signed between Russia and the Central Powers at Brest-Litovsk and peace talks began. The newly formed Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Germans on 3 March 1918, formally ending the war on the Eastern Front and permitting the redeployment of German forces to the Western Front, altering the balance of power. The treaty also permitted the occupation of large areas of European Russia, and within these territories were large stocks of military equipment previously supplied by the allies. In particular, there were large stocks of such supplies in the northern ports of Murmansk and Archangel. The Allied intervention involved fourteen nations and was conducted over a vast expanse of territory. The initial goals of the Western powers had been to rescue the Czechoslovak Legion which had been fighting the Central Powers on the Eastern Front and had later fought the Bolsheviks, as well as to secure the supplies of munitions and armaments in Russian ports to prevent their capture by German forces, and possibly also to re-establish the Eastern Front. With the end of World War I and fearful of Bolshevism, the Allies openly, if only half-heartedly, intervened in the Russian Civil War, giving support to the pro-tsarist anti-Bolshevik White forces as part of the North Russia Campaign. Opposition for the ongoing campaign became widespread, mostly due to a combination of a lack of public support and war-weariness; while divided objectives and a lack of an overarching strategy also hampered the effort. These factors, together with the evacuation of the Czechoslovak Legion and the deteriorating military situation, compelled the Allies to withdraw by 1920. With the end of allied support, the Red Army soon defeated the remaining White government forces, leading to their eventual collapse. North Russian Expeditionary Force (NREF), 1918‚Äì1919 NREF arrives in Murmansk, 1918. Following the collapse of the Russian war effort in the wake of the Revolution in 1917, the British raised and dispatched a force to Northern Russia, known as the North Russian Expeditionary Force (NREF), under the command of Major General Edmund Ironside. Its purpose was to train a White Russian force in preparation for the creation of a new Eastern Front against the Central Powers, as well as to ensure that large quantities of military supplies shipped there to equip the Russian Army under Tsar Nicholas did not fall into German hands. The NREF numbered 70 officers and 500 enlisted men, and was chosen from men who had volunteered in Britain for \\"a secret mission and were not told until their ship had left Newcastle where they were headed.\\" The force was broken into two groups‚ÄîSyren Force (Murmansk) and Elope Force (Archangel)‚ÄîMurmansk was reached on 24 June 1918, while Elope Force subsequently sailed on to Archangel. Included were nine Australians‚Äîthree officers and six sergeants‚Äîwho had been selected by AIF Headquarters in April 1918. All were experienced soldiers, three having served at Gallipoli as well as in France. Sailing on the SS City of Marseilles on 17 June 1918 the Australians arrived in Murmansk and most were immediately sent out on patrol. Later they were switched to the Archangel section. The men were then broken into small advisory groups and attached to White Russian and White Finnish units, being engaged in a range of administrative, instructional and advisory tasks. Due to their isolation, it is difficult to make generalisations about the nature of service experienced by the Australians at this time. Captain P.F. Lohan served in a variety of administrative positions both in Murmansk and Archangel, whilst Sergeant R.L. Graham was commissioned in the field and became railway transport officer on the Archangel-Vologda railway. Several other sergeants were involved in training roles, while Captain Allan Brown was attached to the North Russian Rifles based at Onega‚Äîa White Russian battalion. Australians of Elope Force Not only were the advisers in danger from the enemy, but also from the men they commanded or advised. On 20 July 1919, Brown was murdered by his men when they mutinied and went over to the Bolsheviks. He was the only Australian to be killed, but there was at least one other major mutiny among the White forces during this period, and several other Australians had narrow escapes. With these incidents becoming increasingly common, and with the ineffectiveness of such a small force in influencing the outcome of the civil war, in March 1919 the decision was made to withdraw the force. As all faith had been lost in the reliability of locally raised units, this could only be safely completed with the provision of a covering force, and until this could be raised the NREF was condemned to endure the harsh Russian winter. North Russia Relief Force (NRRF), 1919 Australian soldiers from NRRF in Russia, 1919 Recruiting for the relief force began immediately in England on a voluntary basis and would ultimately include men from every regiment of the British Army, and all the dominions. The North Russian Relief Force (NRRF) subsequently formed two brigades‚Äîone under the command of Brigadier General Lionel Sadlier-Jackson, and the other under Brigadier General George Grogan, and both under the overall command of Major General Edmund Ironside. Sadlier-Jackson's brigade included over 4,000 men, including the 45th and 46th Battalions, the Royal Fusiliers, supporting machine gunners from the 201st Machine Gun Battalion, as well as artillery, signallers and engineers. Grogan's brigade was primarily drawn from battalions of the Worcestershire Regiment. Due to the high regard held for dominion troops as a result of their exploits in France during the war they were specifically targeted for recruitment. Indeed, some 400 to 500 men of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF)‚Äîwho were in England awaiting repatriation to Australia following the end of the war‚Äîinitially indicated a willingness to join, but nowhere near as many actually enlisted. All Australians who volunteered were discharged from the AIF and re-enlisted in the British army as private soldiers for a period of one year. This was necessary because the dominions had already indicated that they were not interested in providing forces for the intervention. Ultimately about 150 Australians enlisted to serve in the NRRF, most of them recruited by Major Harry Harcourt. The Australians mainly served in the 45th Battalion and the 201st Machine Gun Battalion under Sadlier-Jackson, although some may also have served in the 46th Battalion. Despite being enlisted in the British Army the Australians wore uniforms of the AIF and were formed into two mainly Australian companies in the 45th Battalion. The AIF relinquished control over the men and responsibility for them while they were part of the NRRF, but undertook to repatriate them to Australia after they returned from Russia. Their motivations for joining were diverse, although few seemed have been political. Some had arrived in Britain as reinforcements too late to see any fighting during the war, and wanted to experience active service before returning to Australia. Others were decorated veterans and may have been motivated by a desire to see Russia, whilst some may have been unable to settle down after their wartime experiences, and could have viewed service as a means of postponing their return to civilian life. =Arrival and early deployments, June 1919= Bolshevik blockhouse, 1919 The NRRF arrived in Archangel on 5 June 1919 aboard the SS Porto and SS Stephen and almost immediately moved up the Dvina River to a camp at Osinova. There they began training for an offensive up the rail and river systems of the Dvina. This offensive was designed to push the Bolshevik forces of the Red Army back while the Allies withdrew without interference. A secondary aim was to leave the White Russian forces in a better military position, in the optimistic hope they could subsequently hold their own. Meanwhile, with the arrival of the NRRF, the survivors of the earlier NREF were subsequently evacuated. Activity during this period also included small-scale patrol and ambush operations around Troitska to the south in an attempt to keep the Bolsheviks off balance, as well as to provide the White Russian forces with the motivation to fight. Both sides had a small air arm, and the British established a makeshift airfield at Bakaritsa, near Archangel. Later in the campaign Sopwiths from France were used from a strip at Obozerskaya. The allies soon established air superiority, shooting down several Bolshevik aircraft. At least one Australian‚ÄîIra Jones‚Äîis known to have served with the Royal Air Force in North Russia. =August offensives of 1919= Corporal Arthur Sullivan (VC) In early August, Major General Ironside launched his offensive against the 6th Red Army, the British force subsequently inflicting heavy casualties and taking many prisoners for relatively little loss to themselves. The offensive was mainly fought through thick pine forest and swamp which provided little terrain for manoeuvre and although hugely successful, may have been unnecessary. Indeed, the Bolshevik forces in the region perhaps numbered only 6,000 men, and was probably engaged in holding operations only. It has been suggested that they probably had no intention of interrupting the Allied evacuation, and may have been caught unprepared by the sudden offensive. The main Red Army activity in early August was on the Siberian front, where Kolchak's White armies were falling back in disarray. During this time the Australians were prominent in several actions, taking part in at least four major actions‚Äîat Troitsa (Sergeevskaya) on 7 July, at Obozerskaya (–û–±–æ–∑–µ—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π) between 20‚Äì23 July, at Seltsoe (–°–µ–ª—å—Ü–æ) on 10 August and at Emtsa (–ï–º—Ü–∞) on 29 August. Meanwhile, the first significant engagement occurred on 23 July 1919 when Ironside had gone to investigate a meeting of White Russian forces at Obozerskaya. The Australian's subsequently repulsed a Bolshevik attack on a railway in the area surprising the enemy during a relief of their forward blockhouses. They attacked with their bayonets, perhaps killing 30 and wounding many more before setting fire to the blockhouses and withdrawing. On 10 August 1919, one of the largest engagements of the intervention occurred, taking place at Seltso and the surrounding villages along the Dvina. In a confused battle through the marshy swamps Sadlier- Jackson's brigade battled a large Bolshevik force, with the Fusiliers‚Äîincluding the two Australian companies of the 45th Battalion‚Äîfighting their way through with their bayonets and re-occupying Seltso. Perhaps as many as 1,000 prisoners were taken and 19 field guns captured. Due to the terrain the Fusiliers had been unable to manoeuvre their mountain guns through the swamp, whilst Sadlier-Jackson had to use an observation balloon for situational awareness. During this battle an Australian, Corporal Arthur Sullivan, won the Victoria Cross (VC) for saving a group of drowning men while under fire. Sergeant Samuel Pearse (VC) On 29 August 1919, the last British offensive along the railway occurred at Emtsa. The assault on Emsta was a planned attack, in which a White Russian unit was to make a frontal attack on the positions of the 155th Regiment of the Red Army. Attached were the Australians, on their right, and before the assault they moved under the cover of darkness to within of the Bolshevik positions. During the ensuing fighting an Australian, Sergeant Samuel Pearse, cut his way through the barbed wire entanglements under heavy enemy fire, clearing a way for others to enter. With the fire from blockhouses causing casualties among the assaulting troops, Pearse then charged the blockhouses single-handedly with his Lewis gun, killing the occupants with bombs before being killed by machine-gun fire himself soon after. For his actions he was later awarded the second Victoria Cross of the campaign. The furious engagement then ended with the surrender of the Bolshevik forces. =Withdrawal, September‚ÄìOctober 1919= The victories of 10 and 29 August allowed the allies the space they needed to withdraw. Following the August offensive minor patrol activity continued throughout September to provide a screen whilst forward positions were evacuated and stores either removed or destroyed. By the night of 26‚Äì27 September the Allies had subsequently withdrawn from Archangel, and Murmansk was evacuated on 12 October aboard a flotilla of troopships and escorts which sailed for Britain. This thereby ended Australian involvement in North Russia. Other Australian involvement in the Russian Civil War As well as those who served in North Russia, Australians were involved on the periphery of the Russian Civil War. Vessels of the Royal Australian Navy briefly operated in the Black Sea in late 1918, and individuals served in Mesopotamia as part of Dunsterforce and the Malleson Mission. Some Australians also served as advisers with the British Military Mission to Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia and others in South Russia supporting the White Russian General Anton Denikin. =HMAS Swan in the Black Sea, 1918‚Äì1919= HMAS Swan, c. 1916‚Äì18 An Australian naval vessel, HMAS Swan, under the command of Commander Arthur Bond (RN), conducted a reconnaissance and intelligence gathering mission in the Black Sea and territory of the Don Cossacks in December 1918, in conjunction with the French destroyer Bisson. The mission, conducted on behalf of the British military mission then advising the White Russian forces under General Denikin, was detailed to report to the true state of the Cossack forces and was carefully circumscribed by the British Foreign Office. Indeed, although the Cossacks f√™ted Commander Bond as a comrade-in-arms he had to explain to them that they were purely on an information gathering mission with the Australian vessel in no way intended to render military or naval aid to the Cossacks. After inspecting anti-Bolshevik forces in the area, as well as military facilities and factories, Swan subsequently carried out anti- Bolshevik guard duties in Sevastopol, the ship's guns helping protect the railway station at the head of the Inkerman valley. These duties were completed without incident and Swan subsequently sailed for Plymouth on 3 January 1919. Further RAN involvement included HMAS Yarra and HMAS Torrens who were both also involved in the Black Sea area, being the first two destroyers on station at Novorossiisk and Batum. HMAS Parramatta carried despatches and mail between Constantinople and Sebastopol from the time of the Turkish surrender until early January 1919. Parramatta also escorted a group of Russian warships, which were handed over to the anti-Bolshevik forces at Sebastopol in late November 1918. All these operations appear to have been free of incident. Other Australian involvement in South Russia included several Australians acting as advisers with mission to assist General Denikin, including one of who commanded a company of the 7th Battalion, the Royal Berkshire Regiment. Ultimately the British Military Mission remained in South Russia and was only evacuated in March 1920 after Denikin's forces were routed by a Red Army offensive, and the collapse of the White cause seemed imminent. =Dunsterforce and the Malleson Mission in Mesopotamia, 1918‚Äì1919= Dunsterforce fought in Mesopotamia in an attempt to keep the Turks and the Bolsheviks out of Persia and Transcaucasia by rearming and leading those elements of the old Russian imperial army that were still prepared to fight following its collapse. The mission was set up by Major General Lionel Dunsterville in 1918 with the purpose of organising the forces of the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic comprising‚ÄîArmenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia‚Äîto enable them to withstand a Turkish attack. Their task was often impeded by civil war, and in May 1918, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia separately declared their independence. Dunsterforce assumed a more direct military role when Baku was threatened by Turkish attack at the Battle of Baku. In August 1918 it was reinforced by about 1,000 British infantry and occupied the town to prevent the port and nearby oil-fields from falling. Despite initial success Baku was evacuated the following month, due to the vastly superior numbers of the Turkish force. The British returned after the armistice, and remained as an occupying force until September 1919. 48 Australian officers and NCOs were attached to Dunsterforce. Meanwhile, Australians were involved in the Malleson Mission under Major General (Sir) Wilfrid Malleson in Turkestan during 1918‚Äì1919, but they also saw little fighting. Malleson's aim was to block possible German-Turkish thrusts towards India and Afghanistan, but instead his soldiers became involved in fighting the Bolsheviks around Merv. The force withdrew by April 1919. Assessment Although the motivations of those Australians that volunteered to serve in Russia can really only be guessed at, they seem unlikely to have been political. Possibly, as one historian has suggested, \\"a few had not seen enough fighting, or perhaps had seen too much\\". They confirmed the Australians' reputation for audacity and courage, winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign. As the Australian government had refused flatly to supply forces for the intervention, their involvement was limited. Australia's participation was barely noticed at home. Ultimately it made no difference to the outcome of the Russian Civil War, perhaps other than to help confirm the Bolshevik's mistrust of the Western powers. Total Australian casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded, most deaths being from disease during the Mesopotamian operations.

Ending the strike Four papers had originally been the target of the strike, but five other papers suspended printing on a voluntary basis. The New York Post was able to resume printing on March 4, 1963, by withdrawing from the Publishers Association: they would be bound by whatever settlement the other papers made, but would have no further voice in negotiating it. The New York Herald Tribune published a statement that they had chosen not to resume publishing on the same terms because of the risk that the eventual settlement would put them out of business. New York Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., and labor negotiator Theodore W. Kheel were eventually able to forge an agreement to end the strike after several attempts. The first deal offered for ratification by the printers' union was rejected on March 17. In another vote on March 24 they agreed to settle, but by this time the photoengravers' union had decided to join the strike, and they did not settle until March 31. As publication resumed, the first headline in the Daily News was \\"We Have News for You\\". The printers would receive wage and benefit increases of $12.63 per week. Kheel noted that the contracts for all ten newspaper unions would expire on the same date in 1965, emphasizing the importance of addressing the festering labor issues. Aftermath An analysis performed by The New York Times showed that the nine affected newspapers lost a total of more than $100 million in advertising and circulation revenues and that the industry's more than 19 thousand employees lost $50 million in wages and benefits. After the strike was ended, both the Times and Herald Tribune doubled their price to 10 cents, one of the factors that had cut readership. As of September 30, 1963, circulation of six daily New York papers was down 11.9% on weekdays and 8.3% on Sundays based on reports from the Audit Bureau of Circulations. The John F. Kennedy assassination in November 1963 helped bring readers back to newspapers. The New York Daily Mirror, owned by the Hearst Corporation, shut down on October 15, 1963, and sold its name and goodwill to the Daily News. The Mirror's management blamed the closure on the effects of the strike aggravating existing problems at the paper. Cue magazine (now part of New York magazine) saw weekly circulation rise by 35,000 a year after the strike started and TV Guide had seen a jump of 350,000. Time saw New York City circulation rise by 10%.

The airfield was named in honor of USMC 1st Lt. William Dean Hawkins who was killed in the battle to recapture Tarawa, and earned the Medal of Honor. History Armorers place a .50-caliber aircraft John Browning machine gun M2A1 in the nose of a 41st Bombardment Group North American B-25 Mitchell at the airfield on Hawkins Field as interested natives look on The airfield was built during the Japanese occupation of the Gilbert Islands in 1943. There was a turnaround at the eastern end of the runway and a taxiway with revetments in the middle between the runway and the taxiway. The Japanese had Zeros, Vals, Nells and Bettys operating from this base. During the Battle of Tarawa (November 20 ‚Äì 23, 1943), United States Marines seized the airfield as a target of the operation, to enable USAAF land-based air operations against the Japanese in the Marshall Islands. After the battle, US Navy Seebees from the 2nd Battalion 18th Marines, 74th and 98th Naval Construction Battalions bulldozed all the debris off the airfield and extended the runway right to the western end and coral surfaced it.Chapter XXVII, Bases in the Central Pacific, Building the Navy's Bases in World War II, History of the Bureau of Yards and Docks and the Civil Engineer Corps, Volume I, 1940-1946. p. 314 Initially the USAAF moved the 41st Bombardment Group to Hawkins which operated four squadrons of B-25 Mitchell medium bombers from the airfield starting in December. In January 1944, Hawkins became the headquarters of the United States Army Air Forces VII Bomber Command, directing operations against Japanese forces in the Marshall Islands. The USAAF then stationed the B-24 Liberator-equipped 11th Bombardment Group at Hawkins, however the length of the runway was marginal for the bombers, and instead the USAAF units moved to Bairiki (Mullinix) Airfield on nearby Bonriki Islet which had a longer runway. By late January, the USAAF moved both groups over to Bonriki and Hawkins was then used by Naval fighters, light aircraft and as an emergency landing airfield for Mullinix. Aerial view of Hawkins Field in March 1944 As the battles moved further towards Japan, the airfield was abandoned and after the war, the island was redeveloped using much of the materiel left by the Americans during the war. Today, the roads on the island reflect the outlines of the airfield and supporting roads of the wartime facilities. See also * USAAF in the Central Pacific References * Maurer, Maurer (1983).

The Venus Rosewater Dish is the Ladies' Singles Trophy awarded at The Championships, Wimbledon, and was first presented to the Champion in 1886. A Rosewater dish is a ceremonial platter or basin used after eating to catch rosewater poured from warm or cold ewers over the hands to wash them, which was a daily ceremony in England. Later, such dishes were used for display only. A salver (Latin salva, save from risk) was originally used by food tasters who tested food for poison. A rosewater dish was considered a salver by extension. These dishes were made of pewter, silver, or gold. The 50 guineas trophy is an 18 3/4 inch diameter, partially gilded, sterling silver salver made in 1864 by Elkington & Co. of Birmingham, and is a copy of an electrotype by Caspar Enderlein from a pewter original in the Louvre. It is tradition for the winner to be awarded the trophy by the President of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, the Duke of Kent, and then walk a lap around the court to display the trophy to the crowd and photographers. The winner does not keep the trophy, which remains in the museum at the All-England club, but from 1949 to 2006 all Champions have received a miniature replica of the trophy (diameter 8 inches), and from 2007 all Champions have received a three-quarter replica of the trophy, bearing the names of all past Champions (diameter 14 inches). Being a reproduction of a Paris museum antique, the theme of decoration is related to not tennis but Classical mythology. The central boss depicts the figure of Sophrosyne (not Venus), the personification of temperance and moderation, seated on a chest with a lamp in her right hand and a jug in her left, with various attributes such as a sickle, fork and caduceus around her. The four reserves on the boss of the dish each contain a classical god, together with elements. The reserves around the rim show Minerva presiding over the seven liberal arts: astronomy, geometry, arithmetic, music, rhetoric, dialectic and grammar, each with relevant attribute. The rim of the salver has an ovolo moulding. The remainder of the surface is decorated with gilt renaissance strapwork and foliate motifs in relief against a rigid silver ground. The first recipient of the trophy was Blanche Bingley in 1886, the name of Maud Watson, champion of 1884 and 1885 was later added. The names of the winners from 1884 to 1957 are inscribed on the inside of the dish with the names of 1958 to present on the outside.

The Diaries of Hannah Cullwick, Victorian Maidservant. New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 1984. 100-01. Print. House It was until the early 20th century the seat of the Cotes family, and already by 1752 to have been set in well established grounds.John Rocque, Map of Shropshire (1752) Those grounds, and Woodcote Hall, are shown in a fine portrait of John Cotes, M.P. (d.1821).(V.C.H. Shropshire 4 (1989), pl. facing p. 188) A park, however, may not have been established until 1808.cf. R. Baugh, Map of Shropshire (1808); C. and J. Greenwood, Map of Shropshire (1827)). Hannah Cullwick worked as a kitchen scullion at Woodcote for at least a small period of time around Christmas of 1854. Her sister Ellen is also known to have worked there as a servant. Rebuilt in 1875 by F.P. Cockerell(N. Pevsner, Shropshire (1958), 321) after the 18th century mansion was destroyed by fire. There are remains of the original house at the north- west and south-west sides and there are vestiges of 17th century fabric at the rear (south), one room contains fireplaces with inscription \\"T. C. 1767\\" and stopped and chamfered ceiling beams. 'T. C. ' stands for Thomas Cotes. Also a small stone rubble rear wing with stopped and chamfered ceiling beam and tiebeam roof truss with angle struts. The 1875 rebuild is in a Jacobean/Queen Anne style had brick with stone dressings and tiled roof. Traces of the former house were still discernible c. 1882 (O.S. 6, I.SW (1887 ); VII.NW (1891)). The estate was sold out of the Cotes family to Captain James Foster (1853-1927), who had previously leased the house and lived there many years. The hall continued to be occupied as a private house until after the death of his surviving sister. It was bought for ¬£20,000 in 1949 for use by the Roman Catholic Congregation of the Sacred Heart Fathers (Dehonians), SCJs as a junior seminary, opening with students moved from outgrown premises in Earl Shilton and 40 new students from elsewhere. The greater part of its student intake were from Southern Ireland until education changes in their country in the 1960s reduced the rolls (from a peak of 80 boys a year) and caused the seminary to be closed in 1972. The order ran the house as a retreat or recreational centre particularly for youth, until they sold it in 1981. The hall, with its chapel and all outbuildings, was developed into residential flats, a restaurant and a leisure centre but a few years later it was converted into a residential nursing home for old people. In 1957 the Sacred Heart Fathers built a new chapel on the former tennis courts to sit 150 boys, holding seven separate oratories and a spacious sacristy. In 1988 this chapel was converted into an adjunct of the medical centre of the residential home. Grounds In 1752 avenues ran north-east and south-east from the Hall to the road bounding the grounds.J. Rocque, Map of Shropshire (1752) By 1827 the grounds had been imparked. The park was well wooded with large numbers of clumps of trees, especially in its southern part, Woodcote Hill. Running between Woodcote Hall and Woodcote Hill was a series of fish ponds.C. and J. Greenwood, Map of Shropshire (1827) By 1882 the park had been extended east of the Newport-Albrighton-road and a lodge had been built at its southern extremity.O.S. 6, I.SW (1887); VII.NW (1891) The Hall was surrounded by extensive gardens, remarked upon in 1851,S. Bagshaw, Directory of Shropshire (1851), 442 notably to the south where there were large, walled kitchen gardens. In the mid 19th century there were also lavish formal pleasure gardens, and a photograph of c.1860 shows intricate geometric cutwork beds or parterre set in gravel walks (S.R.O. 4688)<1>The park was studied in greater detail by Paul Stamper in c 1995.

Foreign press access to Gaza has been limited since November 2008 via either Egypt or Israel. On 29 December 2008, the Israeli Supreme Court ordered that journalists be allowed into Gaza whenever the crossings were opened, but the IDF refused to comply. There have been arrests of journalists due to violations of wartime censorship in Israel, and these have been denounced by international press organizations. Media infrastructure, including Al-Aqsa TV transmission equipment and foreign and local press offices, were hit during the conflict. Media relations also played an important role, with the use of new media on the part of Israel, as well as a clear public relations campaign. Background Following Israel withdrawal from Gaza there were number of cases of violence targeted at foreign journalists claimed by previously unknown groups sometimes linked to Al Qaeda. The most notable case is kidnapping of BBC journalist, Alan Johnston. Palestinian security sources urged all foreigners (especially Europeans and Americans), including aid workers of international organizations, to leave Gaza soil \\"for fears of new kidnappings\\". Hamas is known to take part in negotiation and release of hostages in many cases. Subsequently, the Foreign Press Association issued a statement saying Gaza had become a \\"no-go zone\\". International organisations instead relied on their local staff to gather information. Foreign press in Gaza Israel and Egypt, the only two countries sharing borders with Gaza, have refused access to Gaza by foreign journalists since November 2008. The Israeli Supreme Court ruled on 29 December that journalists must be allowed access to Gaza at times when the main border crossing is open, but the military has not complied. A spokesman for the Israeli embassy in the United Kingdom said that Israel was restricting entry into Gaza because Gaza is a war zone, and that other countries would do the same. Various press associations and organizations have called this ban as \\"unprecedented\\", and the Foreign Press Association (FPA) of Israel called the ban a \\"violation of press freedom\\" as practiced by other regimes. The International Federation of Journalists said that the ban on foreign media entering Gaza, combined with the Military Censor's now following strict guidelines issued by the head censorship office in Israel, meant that the world was not being allowed to see what is happening in Gaza. As of January 2009, Al Jazeera, whose reporters Ayman Mohyeldin and Sherine Tadros were already inside Gaza when the conflict began, is the only international broadcaster with a journalist reporting from inside Gaza. The BBC has a local producer Rushdi Abu Alouf within Gaza. The New York Times reported on 10 January that \\"Israel has also managed to block cellphone bandwidth, so very few amateur cellphone photographs are getting out of Gaza.\\" On 18 January, journalists entered Gaza via the Erez crossing after a ceasefire was declared. Hamas officials stopped the BBC from filming at one site, possibly because there was a military target nearby. Hits by IDF  Media facilities in Gaza, both foreign and domestic, have come under Israeli fire since the military campaign began. On 29 December, the IDF destroyed the facilities and headquarters of Al-Aqsa TV (though broadcasts continue from elsewhere), and on 5 January, the IDF bombed the offices of the Hamas- affiliated Al-Risala newsweekly. On 9 January, the IDF hit the Johara tower of Gaza City, which houses more than 20 international news organizations, including Turkish, French, and Iranian outlets. Haaretz publish video tape of Gaza reporter confirming Hamas fired rockets near TV offices. Gaza reporter Hanan Al-Masri from Johara tower on Al-Arabiya: \\"A Grad rocket from here? It's here. Listen, it's here, below the building...\\". Al-Jazeera reported that at least one journalist was injured in the attack and Press TV reported that satellite transmission equipment was damaged. An IDF Spokesperson's Unit said the building had not been targeted, though it may have sustained collateral damage. Media restrictions Two Arab journalists from East Jerusalem working for an Iranian TV station were arrested by Israeli authorities on 12 January, and charged with violating IDF censorship protocols for allegedly reporting on the IDF ground offensive into Gaza hours before they were given permission. The journalists denied the charges, maintaining that they merely reported what was being said in the international media. One Italian journalist, after obtaining clearance from the IDF to travel to Netzarim, was fired on at an Israeli checkpoint even after renewed telephonic contact with the military authorities about the incident led to assurances he could proceed safely. Government Press Office chief Daniel Seaman on 25 January denied that Israeli government policy banned foreign reporters from Gaza from 8 November 2008 through 21 January 2009, and denigrated the media as \\"crybabies...unwilling to make effort\\" to get to Gaza, and asserted that all but 3 percent act as \\"a figleaf for Hamas\\". The Foreign Press Association had petitioned Israel's High Court to get unfettered access to the Gaza strip. Press restriction appears to have been part of the propaganda campaign of Operation Cast Lead Nachman Shai, a former Israeli army spokesman, claimed that Israel's tight regulation of the media was a reaction to \\"confusing\\" reporting during the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. The Foreign Press Association of Israel released a statement saying, ‚ÄúThe unprecedented denial of access to Gaza for the world‚Äôs media amounts to a severe violation of press freedom and puts the state of Israel in the company of a handful of regimes around the world which regularly keep journalists from doing their jobs.‚Äù Media campaigns Haaretz reported that Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni \\"instructed senior ministry officials to open an aggressive and diplomatic international public relations campaign in order to gain support for Israel Defense Forces operations in the Gaza Strip.\\" Israeli officials at embassies and consulates worldwide have mounted campaigns in local media, and to that end have recruited people who speak the native language. Israel has also opened an international media centre in Sderot. Deputy Israel's consulate in New York City began holding online press conferences on Twitter, a microblogging website. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Majallie Whbee has criticised some of the international media for not showing the Israeli perspective, saying that some outlets \\"have often failed to report on the pervasive Kassam attacks that preceded the [current] violence\\", according to the Jerusalem Post. There has been a YouTube channel opened by IDF Spokesperson's Unit, with many combat videos and a narrative video log. The videos are intended to bolster Israel's positions on contentious issues. The accuracy of one of the videos has been disputed B'Tselem and Human Rights Watch who claimed that a purported Israeli strike on militants, in fact, killed several civilians. Hamas has also launched a YouTube-like video site broadcasting criticism of Fatah and videos of Hamas attacks and Israeli casualty numbers. Media bias accusations =Israeli media= Israel's media has been criticized for practicing alleged self-censorship and muzzling dissent with coverage on the conflict that has been described as overtly patriotic and biased against Hamas. Eight Israeli human rights groups wrote a letter to newspaper editors, broadcasters and websites claiming, \\"opinions criticising the decision to launch the offensive or the army's conduct during the war are hardly heard.\\" Critics pointed to newspaper headlines describing the surprise airstrikes against Gaza, including the Yedioth Ahronoth headline \\"Better Late Than Never\\" and the Maariv headline \\"Fighting Back.\\" Keshev, an Israeli media watchdog group, said Israeli television channels dispatched their anchors to towns hit by Hamas rockets, but provided little attention to reports of the devastation inside Gaza. As an example, Yizhar Be'er, head of Keshev, cited the relatively little Israeli coverage afforded to the deaths of almost 50 people on 6 January airstrikes on three United Nations schools, which Israeli forces mistakenly believed were used as militant hide-outs. Regarding the overall coverage, Be'er said: A Channel 10 senior editor acknowledged a large amount of patriotism in coverage of the conflict, but attributed it largely to Israel's refusal to allow journalists into Hamas and the army's restrictions over information coming from the battlefield. He told the Agence France-Presse, \\"There are no means to develop criticism because we receive very few details from the army on the fighting inside Gaza... When there is no criticism there is more room for patriotism.\\" =United Kingdom= The BBC received accusations of bias, both for and against Israel, during the conflict, but received particularly intense criticism for its decision not to broadcast a television appeal by aid agencies for victims of the airstrikes against Gaza. BBC officials said the decision stemmed from a policy of maintaining impartiality in the dispute. But many parties criticized the decision, including both Church of England archbishops, British government ministers and even some BBC employees. BBC officials described the criticism as unprecedented, including more than 11,000 complaints in a three-day span. Some protests have accused the company of giving in to pressure from Israel or Jewish groups, while others attribute it to a fear of controversy in light of prior embarrassments over Middle East coverage; the BBC has strongly denied both claims. Arab Media Watch, a London-based watchdog, with the stated aim of striving for objective coverage of Arab issues in the British media, said it had found pro-Israel bias in the British press. According to their study, when the British press represents one party as retaliating, the party is Israel more than three-quarters of the time; in the tabloid press, Israel is portrayed as the retaliating party 100 percent of the time. Violent actions by Israel were portrayed as \\"retaliations\\" three times more often than they were portrayed as \\"provocations.\\" An Arab Media Watch advisor said \\"inevitably, these trends in reporting leave Palestinian violence largely unexplained, causing it to appear as unwarranted 'aggression.'\\" =New York Times= Taghreed El-Khodary, a correspondent for New York Times, was among the few correspondents reporting from Gaza during the 2008‚Äì2009 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict after Israel prevented correspondents from crossing the Gaza-Israel border. El-Khodary describes herself as among the \\"very few objective reporters\\" covering the conflict. She was praised for the \\"in-depth, balanced coverage\\" of the conflict. El-Khodary, who covered the conflict from a position near the Al-Shifa Hospital, was criticized for failing to cover Hamas' use of homes, mosques, hospitals and schools for weapons storage, not reporting on Hamas' use of human shields, not reporting on Hamas' use of children as to assist soldiers, not reporting on Hamas' wartime execution of accused \\"collaborators,\\" and not reporting on the location of the Hamas leadership in a bunker beneath the Shifa Hospital. The Times was accused of failing to balance reports by a journalist whose \\"personal perspective\\" placed blame for the conflict on Israel alone. As El-Khodary put it in a CNN interview, \\"The real issue\\" in the 2008‚Äì2009 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict is \\"The Israeli military occupation.\\" And of publishing a distorted picture of, as El-Khodary expressed it, a situation in which \\"ordinary people are squeezed between suicidal fighters and a military behemoth,\\" and of covering civilian casualties in Gaza \\"to the virtual exclusion of any other issues.\\" Hacktivism The conflict also engendered considerable propaganda, hacktivism and cyber warfare (both on the part of the combatants and polities directly involved and of independent, private parties) which resulted in numerous website defacements, denial-of- service attacks and domain name and account hijackings. An opt-in anti-Hamas botnet created by Israeli students appeared, and new media diplomacy appeared on social networking sites such as Facebook and Second Life, and on new media such as Twitter.

When the L&A; made plans to dispose of the branch Mr. Holloway knowing without the railroad his gravel pit operations would ultimately fail. The LM consisted of a 76.7-mile branch line from Packton, Louisiana, to Vidalia, Louisiana, from the Louisiana and Arkansas Railway. Passenger service was discontinued in 1953.

History =Vietnam, 1967‚Äì1971= 3rd Force Reconnaissance Company was activated, trained, fought and deactivated during the Vietnam War. Activated in September 1965 as one of the first group of add on units to meet demands of operations in South Vietnam, 3rd FORECON formed at Camp Lejeune, N.C. and satellite on 2nd Force Reconnaissance Company that was under strength due to the demands for trained Force Recon Marines assigned to 1st Force Reconnaissance Company in country. Facilities, cadre and equipment for training were provided by 2nd FORECON. Volunteers were solicited from throughout the Marine Corps and the first four months were devoted to bringing 3rd FORECON up to strength in personnel. Beginning in January 1966 all operational personnel departed Camp Lejeune to train in the Caribbean and Panama. Returning to North Carolina in March, final preparations were carried out to meet the projected deployment date in May 1966. The expected deployment of the entire 3rd FORECON did not occur, but a two-platoon detachment embarked on the , transited through the Suez Canal, and arrived in country in time to be introduced to combat in Operation Hastings as part of the Special Landing Force Alpha in early July 1966. 3rd FORECON (-) dropped to a not-combat-ready readiness status. Headquarters Marine Corps transferred several commissioned officers and numerous enlisted ([staff] non-commissioned officers) immediately after the Detachment departed. In mid-June, 3rd FORECON (-) was alerted to deploy immediately. Due to the reduced personnel readiness status, HQMC changed the deployment plan and ordered that a Platoon be assigned to deploy with 1st Battalion, 26th Marines (1/26) that had been activated at Camp Pendleton. The remainder of 3rd FORECON was ordered to move to Camp Pendleton to refit. At the conclusion of Hastings the Detachment was attached to 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion that had just arrived at Phu Bai Combat Base from Da Nang, having been replaced by the 1st Reconnaissance Battalion that had just begun arriving with the 1st Marine Division. Shortly, they were joined by the Platoon that had come in country with 1/26. They patrolled in Th·ª´a Thi√™n Province, until early January, 1967, when a task-organized \\"Special Purpose group\\" carried out a prisoner rescue attempt. The remainder were sent to Khe Sanh Combat Base where they developed the intelligence of a large enemy buildup, that was the prelude to The Hill Fights that occurred in April 1967. Reunited, what was left of the three platoons, returned to Phu Bai to await the arrival of the 3rd FORECON (-). Having been brought up to strength and operational readiness, 3rd FORECON was reunited on 27 May 1966, just in time for the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) offensive to seize Quang Tri Province. The logistics element arrive at the \\"Ramp\\" at ƒê√¥ng H√† Combat Base just in time for the opening salvos of the PAVN artillery attacks that would continue daily until late Autumn. The operational element experienced a mortar attack in Phu Bai at the same time resulting in several shrapnel wounds, only one of which, required evacuation. The new arrivals were integrated with combat veterans and the entire eighteen teams conducted a zone reconnaissance in the CoBi-Than Tan valley northwest of Hu·∫ø before displacing to ƒê√¥ng H√†. Upon arrival at ƒê√¥ng H√† in early May the Commanding Officer assumed command of 3rd Recon Battalion (Forward), which had reconnaissance responsibility for all of Quang Tri Province except the Khe Sanh Tactical Area of Operations (TAOR). 3rd FORECON patrolled the area north of Highway 9 to the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), while a recon company from 3rd Recon Battalion was targeted south of Highway 9 to the Th·ª´a Thi√™n provincial border. Occasional circumstances caused deviation from that concept, but, for the most part, those deviations were rare. 3rd FORECON continued that operational commitment until the 3rd Marine Division left the country in November 1969. 3rd FORECON was placed under command of the III Marine Amphibious Force (III MAF) and operated in general support of III MAF until deactivated in mid-1970.

A number of legal issues arise with the re-importation of goods, particularly where the goods were not designed for sale in the country from which they were initially exported. Because prices differ from one country to another, a re-importer may purchase goods in another country where they are sold at a low price and re-import them in order to undercut the price at which the goods are being sold in the country to which they are imported. Such re-imported goods may constitute grey market goods. Re-importation occurs often when excise taxes are high on a commodity, such as alcohol. Buyers who desire certain domestic products, but do not wish to pay the high excise tax, can buy it from another country where the excise tax is lower. This occurs, for example, when re-importing Koskenkorva Viina, a Finnish product, from Estonia to Finland. The permissibility of re-importation varies based on the product and the jurisdiction involved. For example, Canada prohibits re-importation of books exported from Canada for sale in other countries, while the U.S. prohibits re- importation of products made with packaging or formulations unique to the country to which it has been exported.Peter K.

After fundraising, they began hospital construction in May, 1922 on Longview Street. On July 1, 1924 the 24-bed hospital opened as the Orleans County Memorial Hospital. There were five full-time employees and a nursing school. This ultimately grew to 72 beds in a building. In the early 1970s, Orleans and Essex County worked to raise funds for a new hospital. This opened January 5, 1974 as the North Country Hospital on a site on Prouty Drive. It had 80 beds, an OB/GYN department, pediatrics ward, intensive care/coronary unit, quarters for radiology, laboratory, physical therapy, a hospital with a fully staffed twenty-four-hour emergency service department, and a then-modern surgical suite. It cost $5 million, raised mostly from government funding. Since 1974, additional facilities have included an imaging services, physical therapy, library, information systems, ambulatory surgery suites, birthing rooms, a mobile MRI site, and three new buildings for physician practices in a medical village adjacent to the hospital. Medical practice changed over the years. There was no longer a need for a high inpatient, long-length of stay facility. In September, 2001 the hospital broke ground for the largest building project since the hospital was built. This was completed in 2003. The addition included a surgical suite, new emergency department with indoor ambulance bays, outpatient services, and central sterilization and distribution department. In 2006, a dialysis center opened in the ground floor space under the ED. The hospital had a $55 million budget in 2007. Salaries were $24 million.

It was first designated and paved as an arterial road in 1927. The street has been the focus of several significant ethnic communities over the years. Geography Soto Street begins as Miles Avenue in Huntington Park at Florence Avenue. It becomes Soto after crossing Slauson Avenue, shortly before entering Vernon, where it crosses the Los Angeles River. Soto Street then runs north through the neighborhoods of Boyle Heights, Brooklyn Heights. In El Sereno, near Lincoln Heights, Soto Street merges with Mission Road to form Huntington Drive.

In 2004, a portion of the street in El Sereno known as the Soto Street Bridge, where Soto Street becomes Huntington Drive North, was declared functionally obsolete and scheduled for replacement. The bridge was constructed in 1936 as joint venture between the state, city and Pacific Electric Railway as an overpass of its Red Car system.

He was the director of the Central Institute of Microbiology and Experimental Therapy in Jena from 1953 to 1976, a member of the Academy of Sciences of the German Democratic Republic (i.e. of East Germany), and professor of bacteriology at the University of Jena. He was awarded the National Prize of the GDR in 1949 and 1952. In the late 1960s he got involved in an effort to save the historic center of Jena, protesting against the \\"socialist\\" urban development plans. Career In 1931 he started studying medicine at the University of Frankfurt on Main. A year later he joined the Nazi Party and the Sturmabteilung (SA). He quit the latter in 1935 (after the Night of the Long Knives). Little else is known about his political involvement during this period because his name does not appear in the 200,000-page records recovered from the Nazi Party Chancellery. He gained the Dr. med. degree in 1938. During his studies he was also an assistant at the Institute of Colloid Research at Frankfurt under Raphael Eduard Liesegang. In 1937 Kn√∂ll started cooperating with Jenaer Glaswerk Schott and Gen. which developed all-glass bacterial filters. He developed an accurate measuring procedure for checking the filters. In return the company offered him the opportunity to establish and manage its bacterial laba full-time job Kn√∂ll began in November 1938. At the glass works he established a still existing collection of defined strains of different microorganisms as basis for filter checking. The Schott glass works were associated with Carl Zeiss AG. This led Kn√∂ll to cooperate with the Zeiss factory in the development of phase contrast and fluorescent microscopy. In 1944 he participated in the isolation of nucleosides in living bacteria using phase contrast microscopy. In the same year this successful cooperation led to the transformation of the four- employee lab into the Institute of Microbiology, also known as the Schott- Zeiss-Institute because it was financially supported by the two firms. During World War II, Kn√∂ll's attention was also drawn to penicillin. In 1942 his institute delivered penicillin on laboratory scale. Nazi Germany did not manage to achieve industrial scale production of penicillin before the war ended. After end of the war, Jena fell into the Soviet occupation zone, and the Soviet military administration ordered an immediate expansion in penicillin production. As a result of the rapid increase in the size of the operation, the fermentation section of the Institute of Microbiology became known as Jenapharm in 1947. In 1950 the Institute of Microbiology officially became an independent nationally owned factory, the VEB Jenapharm, and Kn√∂ll was appointed its director. The company's portfolio quickly grew to include streptomycin, vitamins, analgesics, and transfusion solutions. Its workforce expanded to hundreds of employees by the end of the 1940s. In 1949 Kn√∂ll obtained his Habilitation degree, and a year later he became professor of bacteriology at the University of Jena, but he also continued to lead Jenapharm. There Kn√∂ll initiated BCG production, which was used for the tuberculosis vaccination regime in the GDR. The scope of this operation was large enough that a separate building was erected on Jena's Beutenberg Hill in 1952. A year later Kn√∂ll left Jenapharm to become the director of the newly founded Institute of Microbiology and Experimental Therapy (IMET) built on the same Beutenber Hill, according to his directions. In 1956 the institute became part of the East German Academy of Sciences, and its name changed to Central Institute of Microbiology and Experimental Therapy (ZIMET). With this occasion Kn√∂ll became a member of the Academy. In the twenty years that Kn√∂ll led ZIMET, the institute became one of the largest in the GDR with over 1000 employees, and engaged in research and development in antibiotics, biotechnology, experimental therapy, medical and environ microbiology, microbial genetics, and steroids. At ZIMET Kn√∂ll continued to work on problems concerning the miniaturization and automation of microbiological methods. He developed a system of apparatuses for the selection of antibiotic producing microorganisms, and the evaluation of antibiotic activity. He is credited with a complete description of the life cycle of Sarcina maxima in 1973. Preservationist activism Jen-Tower next to steeple of the Collegium Jenense's church Immediately after World War II ended, following Soviet leadership, reconstruction in Jena had emphasized preserving the historically developed structure of East German cities, as well as regional building styles. This policy changed in the 1960s when the central government put emphasis on new and modern buildings. In Jena this change was materialized by an urban plan centered around building a massive skyscraper, the Jen-Tower, within the intimate urban core of the city in 1968-1969\\\\. The skyscraper was meant to be a research facility for the VEB Zeiss, and also to symbolize architecturally the victory of socialism in Germany. Walter Ulbricht, the Socialist Unity Party leader, personally pushed for these developments in early 1968 during a visit to Jena. To accommodate this massive structure, VEB Zeiss would raze much of the old inner city. The activists that fought against the tower's construction nicknamed it \\"penis jenensis\\" taking advantage of its tall cylindrical shape. Collegium Jenense was a thirteenth-century Dominican cloister that was the principal site of the University of Jena from its founding until the mid-nineteenth century. Both Goethe and Alexander von Humboldt had lectured within its walls. The Collegium was not located exactly on the building site of the Zeiss skyscraper, but it was mean to be demolished to make room for an adjacent recreational center that was intended to be connected to the tower. In 1969 Kn√∂ll dedicated himself to saving this site. Taking advantage of his fame he pressured the architect Hermann Henselmann, the city's mayor, the university's rector, Zeiss' general director and other local authorities. He also enlisted several colleagues in this effort, including the physicist Max Steenbeck who also served as technical adviser to Walter Ulbricht. The authorities tried to choke off his efforts by deprecating them. They accused Kn√∂ll of ‚Äúdeviously‚Äù misinforming his fellow citizens about the collegium's fate, and questioned his Institute's overall loyalty to the regime. Taking advantage of the economic difficulties that VEB Zeiss faced at the time, Kn√∂ll demanded immediate assurances that the Collegium would not be demolished until the firm actually had the money to build the recreation center. This was an effective tactic and two years later the state officially conceded that the recreational center would not be built and that the collegium would be spared. The height and breadth of the tower was also reduced. Nevertheless, when it was completed in 1971 it had 27 stories. After its completion the tower became a white elephant, and VEB Zeiss sought to escape the cost of maintaining it. The Council of Ministers shifted ownership of the building to the University of Jena, despite its protestations. Legacy ZIMET was officially closed in 1991 by a decision of Academy of Sciences of the GDR, and its divisions were spun into five separate institutes in 1992. One of these successors, the Hans Kn√∂ll Institute for Natural Products Research (HKI), was named after him. The institute was admitted in the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community in 2003.

Biography.com. Retrieved August 1, 2017. His father was a descendant of Swiss-German immigrants named Sollenberger. He has one sister, Mary. The street on which he grew up in Denison was named after his mother's family. According to his sister, Sullenberger built model planes and aircraft carriers during his childhood, and says he became interested in flying after seeing military jets from an Air Force base near his house. He went to school in Denison, and was consistently on the 99th percentile in every academic category. At the age of 12, his IQ was deemed high enough to join Mensa International. In high school, he was the president of the Latin club, a first chair flutist, and an honor student. He was an active member of the Waples Memorial United Methodist Church in Denison. He graduated from Denison High School in 1969, near the top of his class of about 350. At 16, Sullenberger learned to fly in an Aeronca Champion 7DC from a private airstrip near his home. He said that the training he received from a local flight instructor influenced his aviation career for the rest of his life. Post- secondary education Sullenberger earned a Bachelor of Science from the United States Air Force Academy. He also earned a master's degree in industrial psychology from Purdue University in 1973 and a Master of Public Administration from the University of Northern Colorado in 1979. Military service Sullenberger's 1973 Air Force Academy senior class photograph Sullenberger was appointed to the United States Air Force Academy, entering with the Class of 1973 in June 1969.

He was also known respectfully as Baba, which means Father in his Shona culture. History Baba Jiri was a philanthropist. In the early days of his childhood he had a dream of helping the disabled people. These dreams were motivated by his family background. His father, Chief Mutenyami Jiri was an Appointer of Rozvi Chiefs. The Rozvi Empire ruled the Shona Dzimbabwe (now Zimbabwe) until the assassination of the last Shona King Tohwechipi Chibhamubhamu in Uhera (now Buhera) in 1968. As Royal people, people like Chief Mutenyami would not only appoint chiefs but provide social services in the community like feeding the hungry. His mother, Mai Marufu came from a royal family too and was charitable as was expected of her role. Mai Marufu was a daughter of sub-chief Mazimba of Gutu. As expected of Royal Rozvi, Baba Jiri's family was spiritual and valued family and community. They prayed to Mwari (God) and respected their elders present and past. Jairos grew up heading cattle and learning to write in the sand with sticks or his fingers or on rocks with charcoal. His community was poor and overcrowded after people were moved by white settlers from good land a few decades before he was born. His family and many others in Bikita Reserve struggled to take care of themselves as they did not have good and large enough land to farm. No doubt this background influenced Jairos's view of life when he saw destitute people on the streets of Masvingo (then Fort Victoria) where he worked briefly and in Bulawayo where he arrived on foot from Masvingo in 1939 with his brother Mazviyo Jiri. It was in Bulawayo where he came across more destitute people. Some of the people he saw were half-naked, blind or disabled, and they were begging. This situation was very different from life in his village where any people needing this kind of help were assisted not to live a harsh kind of life. He was motivated to help, but he was only a gardener working for white families and at times a newspaper vendor or deliverer who used an employer's bicycle. He helped in small ways nevertheless. Around the 1940s, he joined the Rhodesian Africa Rifles as a dishwasher. This was during World War II. The facility where he worked rehabilitated soldiers injured in war. He observed rehabilitation workers, and doctors and this have him ideas about rehabilitation. This experience shaped his rehabilitation model. One day, it is reported that he used his worker's bicycle to carry a disabled young man to Old Memorial Hospital, persuaded the hospital to do corrective surgery which he paid for from his meagre earnings. He did not stop there, but took beggars who were blind from the streets of Bulawayo to his lodgings. He created backyard facilities in the 1940s for disadvantaged and disabled people in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. His inspiration came from unhu (also known as Ubuntu) values of helping, giving, friendship, being good in the community and working and doing work that please Mwari (God). He was probably also motivated by Christian principles of charity, patience and non-judgmental tolerance that he gained from Gokomere Mission School where he attended school for a few days before falling sick and returning home. The experience led him to register the first disability organisation by a black person in Zimbabwe. The organisation was registered as Bulawayo and Bikita Physically Defective Society, but later changed to Jairos Jiri Association for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled and the Blind. Initial attempts to register were dismissed by the colonial administrators who thought his ideas were wild. He had to overcome numerous bureaucratic huddles as a black person registering a first charity organisation in colonial Rhodesia. The Jairos Jiri Association was founded in Bulawayo in 1950. The first committee was made up of Stephen Kwenda (Secretary), Fabian Dururu (Treasurer), and members Job Mapfinya and Jacob Mufute. After hard years of setting up a new organisation, in 1950 the first skills training workshop was held with the support of Bulawayo City Council. In 1959, he opened a training centre in Nguboyenja. This was followed by a tour of rehabilitation facilities in the United States and Europe supported by donors. He expanded his work to Harare (then Salisbury) after getting land from Salisbury City Council. The art centre outlet for the association quickly achieved prominence and by the 1960s was a prime source of curios for tourists. These items were made by disabled people and included tiles and tiled tables and wall plaques, carvings, pottery, painted artworks and sculptures. His rehabilitation centre in Bulawayo also fostered music and dance resulting in bands like the Jairos Jiri band popularised by Paul Matavire who was blind. By 1974 the centres had expanded and diversified to include homes for the disabled, and legal representation was gained locally and in the United Kingdom. Jairos Jiri centres and his philosophy are still a major resource for community action and charity in Zimbabwe. Baba Jairos Jiri's Charity Model Mr Jiri's work charity model was replicated by several organisations in Zimbabwe. His model can be described by the acronym HOPESS as follows: # Have values of unhu. # Observe the environment for opportunities of helping. # Provide help using your own physical, financial and other resources. # Encourage and treat people you want to help as your friends and family. # Seek outside help. # Start and sustain a charity organisation. Baba Jairos Jiri's Rehabilitation Model Mr Jiri's rehabilitation work can be described as follows: # Encourage and treat people you want to help as friends or family, that is, be their parent. # Use existing facilities and resources, for example, work together with friends, family, community and use local resources at hospitals and clinics. # Provide resources, e.g. take people to facilities because they may not be able to go on their own. # Provide ideas about how rehabilitation could be done, that is, be an active carer. # Provide accommodation (institutionalization) to reduce stigma and cost of care. # Provide training and income opportunities like enterprises. The major strengths of his model are that it supports building of skills and income but a major weakness in institutionalization because resources like food are limited. Further once institutionalised, people are separated from community and it becomes very difficult for them to thrive in those communities when they go back. This model does not address the structural issues that cause disability, exclusion and injustice. However, the work that he started has changed to include community work and advocacy for social inclusion. Awards in Zimbabwe Getting recognised by the name Baba at a national scale is not an easy thing to achieve in Zimbabwe. That respect is given to people who have played a major role in national building. Baba Jiri was honoured by Zimbabweans who refer to him as Baba, meaning Respected Father. In 1982 when he died, he was honoured with National Hero of Zimbabwe status but opted to be buried in his home village of Bikita instead of at the National Heroes Acre in Harare. Being buried in the village among your other deceased family members is a key unhu value. Later, the government of Zimbabwe honoured him by naming an award in his name, The Jairos Jiri Humanitarian Award given to people who contribute significantly to helping others, for example, those who helped Cyclone Idai victims in Chimanimani in 2019. In 1977, he was awarded an Honours Degree in Masters of Arts by the then University of Rhodesia. International awards In 1959, the Queen of the United Kingdom awarded Mr Jiri an MBE, which means Member of the British Empire. Other awards included: # International Symposium on Rehabilitation awarded in Kampala, Uganda in 1975. # Audience with Pope Paul VI, where he received a blessing for his great work and was presented with a medal marking a Holy year in 1975. # Lions International Service Award in 1977. # Humanitarian Award from the then Salisbury Union of Jewish Women in 1977. # Freedom of the City of Los Angeles in 1981. # Goodwill Industries International Award for Humanitarian and Rehabilitation Work in 1981. # Rotary International presented him with their International Year of Disabled Person Award for Africa which carries citation ‚ÄúGreatest Contribution to Rehabilitation in Africa - IYDP 1981‚Äù. Birth of the Zimbabwe disability movement The Zimbabwean disability movement for equality was born in institutions run by Jairos Jiri in 1975 but he did not support it. Like many people that time, he saw the call for involvement, participation and increased opportunities as a threat to his charity model. The movement emanated from people like Joshua Malinga who went on to become a politician against while rule and Mayor of Bulawayo from 1993-1995. The activists formed and registered the National Council of Disabled Persons Zimbabwe which started as Kubatsirana Welfare Society later National Council for the Welfare of Disabled while still in the institutions. In 1980, Malinga attended an international disability congress, Disabled Peoples' International‚Äôs Winnipeg World Congress in Canada. This marked internationalization of disability work in Zimbabwe. Legacy At the time of his death, the Association, which Mr. Jiri founded, had grown from 1 centre in 1950 to 16 centres including schools, special schools for the deaf and blind, hostels and homes, vocational training center, agriculture skills training center, clinics, orthopaedic workshops and satellite units, Community-based Rehabilitation Programme, craft shops and gender empowerment programmes. \\"(Baba)Jairos Jiri not only gave hope and opportunity to thousands of people living with disabilities during his lifetime and after his death, but also earned Zimbabwe international recognition in the care and rehabilitation of the disabled. It takes a man of great compassion and courage to assume responsibility for such people and to break down the barriers and attitudes of society towards them, and in doing so, restore to them human dignity and rightful place in the community. He has left a tangible legacy to the nation and all of us inherit the Jairos Jiri Association with gratitude and pride in its achievements to date\\". Family Jairos Jiri had 18 children in total and was divorced three times. He lived with his last wife Ethel Jiri, their seven daughters: Patricia, Patience, Precious, Primrose, Priscilla, Penelope Pamela who was 11 days old when he died in 1982. One of his son, Last was involved in the Jairos Jiri Family Trust. Ethel Jiri died from throat cancer and was buried alongside her husband in Bikita ‚Äì Mutenyami village. Jairos Jiri was supposed to be buried at the recently established National Heroes Acre in Harare but his brother Ziwumbwa opted to have him buried in the village alongside his people, a key ubuntu value. Jairos was buried in the Mutenyami Village in Bikita and the burial was attended by prominent people including the then Prime Minister of Zimbabwe, Robert Gabriel Mugabe and by the then Deputy Prime Minister the late Comrade Simon Muzenda References   1921 births 1982 deaths Zimbabwean philanthropists 20th-century philanthropists ","title":"Jairos Jiri"},{"id":"21143392","text":"SS Benalbanach was the name of two ships operated by the Ben Line. * , sunk off Algiers in 1943 with the loss of 410 lives. * , ex-Empire Athelstan, served with Ben Line from 1947‚Äì63.

Measuring in length, the island has a lagoon with a width of covering an area of . The ecological feature of the island is of coral reef with seagrass, and marine turtles which nestle here. The Ministry of Environment and Forests (India) has notified the island as a marine protected area for ensuring conservation of the island's animal, plant, or other type of organism, and other resources. The only inhabited village on the island is Kadmat, which had a population of 5,389 according to 2011 census. Fisheries is the main economic activity on the island with agriculture limited to 5% of the land area. Tourism is allowed even for non-Indians and the attractions are kayaking, snorkeling and leisure trips by a glass-bottomed boat for scuba diving. Geography and climate The beach side resort at Kadmat Island Kadmat Island, which belongs to the township of Kadmat Island of Aminidivi Tehsil. is the central most island of the Lakshadweep archipelago. It is in the shape of a tear drop, with area and is located on a coral reef. With a length of from north to south and a maximum width of and it is the longest island in the Amindivi group. Its southern end is the narrowest with a width of about . The island's topography is about on the eastern side and on the western part above the mean sea level. Its surface formation consists of coral conglomerate overlying broken pieces of coral and coral sand. The lagoon on the western side of the island extends over a maximum width of covering an area of and the water depth is shallow about . It has a shore line and has a sandy beach. The reef width is about . The tidal range lies between . The beach on the eastern side of the island has a width of . At the breaking zone of this beach there is a wide coral algae ridge. Kadmat Island is bounded by Kavaratti Island to its northwest at a distance of . It is away from Kiltan Island. Amini Island, which marks the northwestern part of the Pitti Bank formation, is to the southwest. Kochi is away. There is an airport on nearby Agatti Island, in which flights operate from Cochin. From Agatti, it is a two and half hours boat ride to Kadmat. Ferry services also operate from Cochin on the coast of Kerala but involves a journey of 16 hours. Climate and the environment Boats on the beach of Kadmat The island experiences an average annual temperature in the range of . Rainfall occurs during the monsoon season from May to September with an average annual rainfall incidence of as per records of the nearby island of Amini. The maximum rainfall recorded in a day is . Humidity averages at 72.5%. Ecologically, the island is composed of coral reef with seagrass, and marine turtles which nestle here. Keeping this aspect in view, the Ministry of Environment and Forests (India) has notified the island as a marine protected area to enable conservation of the island's animal, plant, or other type of organism, and other resources. The coral reefs are damaged to the extent of 10% (assessed by IUCN in 1976) due to anthropocentric pressure and also due to climate change. Dredging operation at the entry to the island is causing damage to coral species as the dredged material is dumped into the lagoon. Coral blocks found in the beaches and the coral flats are extracted for building activity on the island. This could cause serious geo-morphological changes of the island in the form of sea erosion of the shores and the beach. Coral bleaching, a natural phenomenon attributed to strong El Ni√±os, which occurred during 1998 due to seawater warming, is reported to have reduced the number of coral species from 45 to 9. Demographics The island is inhabited mainly by individuals of the Melacceri caste. Kadmat village is the only inhabited village on the island. According to the 2011 census the island had a population of 5,389 consisting of 2,676 males and 2,713 females. Population density is 1,727 per km2. Decennial Growth Rate recorded for the period 2001‚Äì2011 was 1.03 percent. In 2001, the literacy rate was 87.88 percent of which male literacy rate was 91.78 and female literacy was 92.53; in both cases much higher than of the Lakshadweep island. Malayalam is the dominant language of the people of the island and the literacy rate is as high as 90.4%. The island has a network of roads, several ponds and wells, primary and higher secondary schools, electricity, telephone, health centres and so forth. In 1960, a hoard of coins were unearthed and examined, revealing that the island has been inhabited since at least 200 AD. Kadmat island is known to have traded with the Romans, as in 1948 a girl found a Roman coin in a quarry on the island. Economy Drying octopus on Kadmat Fishing is the principal activity of the people of the island. Fishing is done both off shore in the sea and during the monsoon season in the lagoon and reef area. Trawl nets and pole line are used for oceanic tuna fishing. Wooden boats are used for local fishing in the lagoon. Fish species reported include carangids, cephalopods, perches, rainbow sardine, rays, sail fishes, sharks, skipjack tuna, and tuna. Agriculture is practised, with about 5% of the land area brought under cultivation. Coconut plantations are common along with associated coir twinning. Crops grown include red grass, groundnut, maize, sweet potato, grains, cereals, millets, papaya, and banana. Tourism has taken off on the island, though it only one beach resort for 50 guests. There are kayaking and snorkeling facilities, and leisure trips by a glass-bottomed boat for scuba diving. In 1998 the first Water Sports Institute was established on Kadmat, along with the Laccadives Diving Centre. Wildlife The island has three types of habitats: coral reef, seagrass and nesting ground for marine turtles. Zoning of the coral reef is mapped under three zones of reef flat, reef slope and lagoon. Next to the shore line are the fringing reefs where fish species of fin and shell fishes spawn, and are found in abundance. As of 1986, there were 45 coral species in the reef. These are threatened due to human interference and natural causes. Live coral is reported in less than 1% area. There are 9 species of live corals in the lagoon and reef slope area. The species of live corals reported are: Acropora formosa (staghorn coral), Acropora robusta, Acropora, Acropora subglabra, Acropora tortuosa, Acropora vaughani, Favites, Pocillopora verrucosa and Lobophytum Benthic organisms are reported on the reef slope and lagoon area. Macrobenthos are found in the inter-tidal and sub-tidal area. 23 species of polychaetes, 3 species of bivalves, 3 species of crustaceans, and 3 species of gastropods have been recorded. The seagrass beds, which forms an area of around across the island, provide crucial food for turtles and dugongs, with four species of marine turtles reported: Chelonia mydas (green sea turtle), Dermochelys coriacea (leatherback sea turtle), and Eretmochelys imbricata (Hawksbill sea turtle) and Lepidochelys olivacea (Olive Ridley sea turtle). There are 7 species of seagrass reported here, out of 14 found in the Lakshadweep Islands, including the Thalassia hemprichii and Cymodocea rotundata. Seaweeds recorded consist of 34 species, out of which 14 species are of Rhodophyceae, 13 (red algae) are Chlorophyceae (green algae) and 7 species are Phaeophyceae (brown algae). 20 species of Phytoplankton and 19 groups of Zooplankton have been recorded in the reef slope and lagoon area; 33 species of benthic organisms have also been noted in the same vicinity.

She is the princess and ruler of Sarasaland, who is kidnapped by Tatanga. Since her appearance in Mario Tennis, she has become a staple playable character in the Mario spin-off games, in which she is often paired up with Princess Peach. It is often speculated that she is Luigi's love interest. Her official description for Mario Party 4 states that she and Luigi have a rumored love interest, more so from Luigi; but Waluigi likes her too, which she does not appreciate. Daisy appears as a protagonist in the 1993 film Super Mario Bros., portrayed by Samantha Mathis. The character is created by Shigeru Miyamoto's mentor Gunpei Yokoi. Concept and creation Daisy's emblem is used to represent her in many games Super Mario Lands producer, Gunpei Yokoi, wanted to recreate the feeling of 1985's Super Mario Bros., only set in a separate world to the Mushroom Kingdom. This world would be Sarasaland (occasionally styled Sarasa Land), and Daisy would be its princess. However, later games mention that she now resides in the Mushroom Kingdom, and Sarasaland is only hinted in Daisy's quotes and biographies for subsequent games. Her early design looked more similar to Princess Peach, except with orange-brown, titian hair instead of yellow hair, a yellow dress with short puffy sleeves, white frills, orange high heels, a daisy-shaped brooch, crown and earrings, and wrist-length white evening gloves. In 2000's Mario Tennis, she appeared in game artwork with long hair like Pauline, and retained her flower brooch and earrings. She also had a slightly darker skin tone. This design endured until 2002's Mario Party 4, in which she was given her current design which distinguished Daisy further from Peach by depicting her with different physical traits, such as a flip hairstyle and light skin, yet with her dress design and crown color being more consistent with Peach's. In her first appearance, Daisy was described as a tomboy, a trait she has maintained throughout the games, with Daisy being depicted as a more cheerful and boastful character than Peach. In Mario sports games, she wears more athletic outfits instead of her usual dress, her color scheme normally being yellow and orange. Her special abilities are often based around flowers, with the daisy flower being her namesake. Appearances =In video games= , Daisy has appeared in 73 games, in most of which she is a playable character. Her first appearance in the Mario series is in Super Mario Land, released in 1989 for the Game Boy. Daisy is the princess of Sarasaland, a world outside of the series' usual setting of the Mushroom Kingdom, who is kidnapped by the tyrannical alien, Tatanga, who intends to marry her in order to gain control of her realm. Mario must traverse the four kingdoms of Sarasaland in order to track down Tatanga and rescue Daisy. She next made a small appearance in NES Open Tournament Golf in 1991 as Luigi's caddy. She did not appear in another game for nine years until 2000's Mario Tennis by Camelot Software Planning on the Nintendo 64, in order to introduce more human characters into the game. Daisy is regularly a playable character in the Mario sports games. She appears in all of the Mario Party series since Mario Party 3 except Mario Party Advance, and all of the Mario Kart games since Double Dash except for the first two installments of the Arcade GP series, and all five games in Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games. She also appears in the Square Enix game Fortune Street. On September 29, 2017, Daisy was added to the list of playable characters in Super Mario Run. Outside of the Mario game series, Princess Daisy was included as a skin in the Minecraft: Wii U Edition Super Mario Mashup Pack, released on May 16, 2016. Additionally, Daisy has been alluded in various games. For example, in every Super Smash Bros. title released since Super Smash Bros. Melee, in addition to Daisy's appearance as trophies, one of Peach's reoccurring alternate skins represents Daisy's color scheme. She has a third eye in the back of her head of her trophy in earlier versions, which was later removed in the later copies. In Melee, there is an error in her trophy description. It says she appeared in Mario Golf for the Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color, although she actually appeared in Mario Tennis for the same consoles. She appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as another trophy with her attire from Mario Strikers Charged. She appears in two stickers: one with her in Super Mario Strikers, and one with her and Peach in Mario Party 7. Again, her description has an error. It says her iconic dress color is yellow and white, but now she wears an iconic yellow and orange dress. She reappears in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS as both a palette for Peach and an unlockable trophy with Daisy in her tennis attire. In Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, she appears not in one trophy, but three trophies, one with her in her dress, one with her in her baseball attire, and her baby counterpart. Her Peach palette appears in a picture in Peach‚Äôs clear movie for beating Classic Mode as Peach. She is a newcomer in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, as Princess Peach's echo fighter. In the Wii U and Nintendo Switch versions of Bayonetta and Bayonetta 2, one of Bayonetta's Nintendo outfits is based on Daisy's dress design. Daisy's amiibo was released on November 4, 2016 to coincide with the release of Mario Party: Star Rush. =In other media= Daisy was one of the main characters of 1993's Super Mario Bros. film, loosely based on the games, in which she was portrayed by Samantha Mathis. In the film, Daisy is a student of archaeology at New York University whom Luigi falls in love with. While digging for dinosaur bones under the Brooklyn Bridge, Daisy is kidnapped by two henchmen of President Koopa, the dictator of an alternate world in which dinosaurs rule, of which Daisy is actually the princess. Luigi and Mario give chase in order to rescue her. Daisy also appeared once again as the prisoner of Tatanga in some episodes of the Nintendo Comics System. Reception Initially, Princess Daisy drew little comment. In her early appearances, she was so similar to Princess Peach that some journalists even assumed that \\"Princess Daisy\\" was simply a new localization of \\"Princess Peach\\" rather than a new character. GameDaily listed Daisy at number eight in a top-ten list of Mario characters who deserve their own game. GamerVision's \\"Coop\\" wrote an article entitled \\"Top Ten Reasons Daisy is Better Than Peach\\", giving reasons ranging from her having a \\"less- annoying voice\\" and having a \\"better attitude\\", to Daisy being a better ruler due to the fact that Sarasaland has only been invaded once, whilst Peach's Mushroom Kingdom is always being invaded. Destructoid's Gamer's Red Carpet called \\"her choice of a brave yellow and orange combo dress... as flattering as it is retro\\", and that her dress and accessories \\"work much better than Peach's\\", grading her a B+ overall. In 2010, Audrey Drake at IGN listed Daisy as a potential valentine for Mario, commenting that being his \\"brother's gal\\" made her a sort of \\"forbidden fruit\\", and that he had saved her during the events of Super Mario Land. GamesRadar's Henry Gilbert wrote that it became increasingly evident that Luigi also needs \\"his own princess\\" and Princess Daisy is the character he is closest to. The pairing of Daisy and Luigi was included in Screw Attack's \\"Best EVER: Love Stories\\" video. She was also featured on Susanna Sheath's top 10 Mario characters as her number two choice. IGN reviewed Daisy negatively, giving her a 4 out of 10, whereas Princess Peach got an 8, Rosalina a 7 and Pauline an 8, but said that the \\"spark between Daisy and Luigi still burns bright.\\" Lisa Foiles of The Escapist ranked Daisy number one on their list of top five annoying princesses in video games, stating she didn't really have a good reason why. Daisy's infant counterpart, Baby Daisy, was listed by 1UP.com as one of the worst Mario Kart Wii characters.

It was recorded by many singers, including John McCormack, Eleanor Steber, Nelson Eddy, and Judy Garland, and remained a popular standard for decades. Bing Crosby recorded the song in 1956 for use on his radio show and it was subsequently included in the CD On the Sentimental Side (2010). Penn's song was also closely associated with the 1919 play Smilin' Through by Jane Cowl. The creation of the song and that of the play were independent but intertwined. According to Isidore Witmark in his history of the Witmark and Sons publishing house, Cowl's play was partially rewritten after the song was published, based upon the imagery of the lyrics. Both the title and music of the song were incorporated into the play when it was completed and produced on Broadway in December, 1919.Witmark, Isidore; Isaac Goldberg.

Jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter plays his own interpretation of the ballad on the album \\"Beyond the Sound Barrier\\" (2005).

FUD is generally a strategy to influence perception by disseminating negative and dubious or false information and a manifestation of the appeal to fear. While the phrase dates to at least the early 20th century, the present common usage of disinformation related to software, hardware and technology industries generally appeared in the 1970s to describe disinformation in the computer hardware industry, and has since been used more broadly. Definition The term \\"fear, uncertainty, and doubt\\" appeared as far back as the 1920s, whereas the similar formulation \\"doubts, fears, and uncertainties\\" even reaches back to 1693 the least. By 1975, the term was appearing abbreviated as FUD in marketing and sales contexts as well as in public relations: The abbreviation FUD is also alternatively rendered as \\"fear, uncertainty, and disinformation\\". FUD was first used with its common current technology-related meaning by Gene Amdahl in 1975, after he left IBM to found his own company, Amdahl Corp.: The term has also been attributed to veteran Morgan Stanley computer analyst Ulrich Weil. This usage of FUD to describe disinformation in the computer hardware industry is said to have led to subsequent popularization of the term. As Eric Steven Raymond wrote: By spreading questionable information about the drawbacks of less well-known products, an established company can discourage decision-makers from choosing those products over its own, regardless of the relative technical merits. This is a recognized phenomenon, epitomized by the traditional axiom of purchasing agents that \\"nobody ever got fired for buying IBM equipment\\". The aim is to have IT departments buy software they know to be technically inferior because upper management is more likely to recognize the brand.  Examples  = Software producers =  Microsoft  From the 1990s onward the term became most often associated with Microsoft. Roger Irwin said: In 1996, Caldera, Inc. accused Microsoft of several anti-competitive practices, including issuing vaporware announcements, creating FUD, and excluding competitors from participating in beta-test programs in order to destroy competition in the DOS market. One of the claims was related to having modified Windows 3.1 so that it would not run on DR DOS 6.0 although there were no technical reasons for it not to work. This was caused by the so-called AARD code, some encrypted piece of code, which had been found in a number of Microsoft programs. The code would fake nonsensical error messages if run on DR DOS, like: If the user chose to press , Windows would continue to run on DR DOS without problems. While it had been already speculated in the industry that the purpose of this code was to create doubts about DR DOS's compatibility and thereby destroy the product's reputation, internal Microsoft memos published as part of the United States v. Microsoft antitrust case later revealed that the specific focus of these tests was in fact DR DOS. At one point, Microsoft CEO Bill Gates sent a memo to a number of employees, reading Microsoft Senior Vice President Brad Silverberg later sent another memo, stating In 2000, Microsoft settled the lawsuit out-of-court for an undisclosed sum, which in 2009 was revealed to be $280 million. At around the same time, the leaked internal Microsoft \\"Halloween documents\\" stated \\"OSS [Open Source Software] is long-term credible‚Ä¶ [therefore] FUD tactics cannot be used to combat it.\\" Open source software, and the Linux community in particular, are widely perceived as frequent targets of Microsoft's FUD: * Statements about the \\"viral nature\\" of the GNU General Public License (GPL). * Statements that \\"‚Ä¶FOSS [Free and open source software] infringes on no fewer than 235 Microsoft patents\\", before software patent law precedents were even established. * Statements that Windows Server 2003 has lower total cost of ownership (TCO) than Linux, in Microsoft's \\"Get-The-Facts\\" campaign. It turned out that they were comparing Linux on a very expensive IBM mainframe to Windows Server 2003 on an Intel Xeon-based server. * A 2010 video claimed that OpenOffice.org had a higher long-term cost of ownership, as well as poor interoperability with Microsoft's own office suite. The video featured statements such as \\"If an open source freeware solution breaks, who's gonna fix it?\\"  SCO v. IBM  The SCO Group's 2003 lawsuit against IBM, funded by Microsoft, claiming $5 billion in intellectual property infringements by the free software community, is an example of FUD, according to IBM, which argued in its counterclaim that SCO was spreading \\"fear, uncertainty, and doubt\\". Magistrate Judge Brooke C. Wells wrote (and Judge Dale Albert Kimball concurred) in her order limiting SCO's claims: \\"The court finds SCO's arguments unpersuasive. SCO's arguments are akin to SCO telling IBM, 'sorry, we are not going to tell you what you did wrong because you already know‚Ä¶' SCO was required to disclose in detail what it feels IBM misappropriated‚Ä¶ the court finds it inexcusable that SCO is‚Ä¶ not placing all the details on the table. Certainly if an individual were stopped and accused of shoplifting after walking out of Neiman Marcus they would expect to be eventually told what they allegedly stole. It would be absurd for an officer to tell the accused that 'you know what you stole, I'm not telling.' Or, to simply hand the accused individual a catalog of Neiman Marcus' entire inventory and say 'it's in there somewhere, you figure it out. Regarding the matter, Darl Charles McBride, President and CEO of SCO, made the following statements: # \\"IBM has taken our valuable trade secrets and given them away to Linux,\\" # \\"We're finding‚Ä¶ cases where there is line-by-line code in the Linux kernel that is matching up to our UnixWare code\\" # \\"‚Ä¶unless more companies start licensing SCO's property‚Ä¶ [SCO] may also sue Linus Torvalds‚Ä¶ for patent infringement.\\" # \\"Both companies [IBM and Red Hat] have shifted liability to the customer and then taunted us to sue them.\\" # \\"We have the ability to go to users with lawsuits and we will if we have to, 'It would be within SCO Group's rights to order every copy of AIX [IBM's proprietary UNIX] destroyed',\\" # \\"As of Friday, [13] June [2003], we will be done trying to talk to IBM, and we will be talking directly to its customers and going in and auditing them. IBM no longer has the authority to sell or distribute IBM AIX and customers no longer have the right to use AIX software\\" # \\"If you just drag this out in a typical litigation path, where it takes years and years to settle anything, and in the meantime you have all this uncertainty clouding over the market‚Ä¶\\" # \\"Users are running systems that have basically pirated software inside, or stolen software inside of their systems, they have liability.\\" SCO stock skyrocketed from under a share to over in a matter of weeks in 2003. (It later dropped to around then crashed to under 50 cents on 13 August 2007, in the aftermath of a ruling that Novell owns the UNIX copyrights.)  Apple  Apple's claim that iPhone jailbreaking could potentially allow hackers to crash cell phone towers was described by Fred von Lohmann, a representative of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), as a \\"kind of theoretical threat‚Ä¶more FUD than truth‚Äù. = Security industry = FUD is widely recognized as a tactic to promote the sale or implementation of security products and measures. It is possible to find pages describing purely artificial problems. Such pages frequently contain links to the demonstrating source code that does not point to any valid location and sometimes even links that \\"will execute malicious code on your machine regardless of current security software\\", leading to pages without any executable code. The drawback to the FUD tactic in this context is that, when the stated or implied threats fail to materialize over time, the customer or decision-maker frequently reacts by withdrawing budgeting or support from future security initiatives. FUD has also been utilized in technical support scams where fake error messages are used to scare unwitting computer users, especially the elderly or computer-illiterate, into paying for a supposed fix for a non-existent problem to avoid being framed for criminal charges such as unpaid taxes, or in extreme cases, false accusations of illegal acts such as child pornography. = Caltex = The FUD tactic was used by Caltex Australia in 2003. According to an internal memo, which was subsequently leaked, they wished to use FUD to destabilize franchisee confidence, and thus get a better deal for Caltex. This memo was used as an example of unconscionable behaviour in a Senate inquiry. Senior management claimed that it was contrary to and did not reflect company principles. = Clorox = In 2008, Clorox was the subject of both consumer and industry criticism for advertising its Green Works line of allegedly environmentally friendly cleaning products using the slogan, \\"Finally, Green Works.\\" The slogan implied both that \\"green\\" products manufactured by other companies which had been available to consumers prior to the introduction of Clorox's GreenWorks line had all been ineffective, and also that the new GreenWorks line was at least as effective as Clorox's existing product lines. The intention of this slogan and the associated advertising campaign has been interpreted as appealing to consumers' fears that products from companies with less brand recognition are less trustworthy or effective. Critics also pointed out that, despite its representation of GreenWorks products as \\"green\\" in the sense of being less harmful to the environment and/or consumers using them, the products contain a number of ingredients advocates of natural products have long campaigned against the use of in household products due to toxicity to humans or their environment. All three implicit claims have been disputed, and some of their elements disproven, by environmental groups, consumer- protection groups, and the industry self-regulatory Better Business Bureau.  Further reading  While common usage of the term \\"FUD\\" is relatively recent and somewhat limited, the practice of casting unwarranted aspersions upon other persons, products or circumstances to further one's own goals may be as old as humanity; examples in classic literature include Iago in Shakespeare's Othello, and the terms in the \\"See also\\" section below offer many further examples.

It was a shop of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), Ottawa-Outaouais General Membership Branch. The union fought systematic oppression faced by street people in Ottawa; this includes the homeless, panhandlers, buskers, and people with who are part of the street. Andrew Nellis was spokesperson for this union, roughly from 2005 until his resignation in April 2011. The next spokesperson was Karen Crossman. The union had adopted 'Working For Change' as its official motto.  Structure and character  Andrew Nellis at the May 1, 2006 May Day march in Ottawa. The organization was largely a collaborative effort by lead organizer, IWW delegate and spokesperson Karen Crossman, and other long time anti-poverty Ottawa activists. Some of the main pieces of legislation which motivated activists to form the Panhandler's Union was the Safe Streets Act and a piece of legislation dubbed Brian's Law which was eventually found to be unconstitutional as it was used to pick up homeless people up off the street and put them in jail or mental institutions without due process. Other pieces of legislation objected to include the Vending on Highways Law, passed by Ottawa City Hall. Aside from one of its members, the panhandlers' union dues were paid for by the Industrial Workers of the World through donations and various organized events. The Panhandlers' Union was not a conventional labour union in that its members performed their labor in non-traditional ways. This led to ridicule of the union, including an article critiquing the union in the Ottawa Citizen which asked if the panhandlers were fighting for \\"wider sidewalks?\\" The newspaper granted the union a chance to respond with their own op-ed piece, and their editorial, \\"Why Panhandlers Need a Union\\", appeared in the newspaper on March 20, 2006. In May 2007 union and its organizer Andrew Nellis were featured in a multi-page article in the Ottawa City Journal. The newspaper also interviewed panhandlers and the executive director of the Bank Street Business Improvement Area. The union met once a month at a drop-in centre in the ByWard Market area of Ottawa. The meetings are open to anyone who is interested in becoming a member of union. The standard IWW rules of membership are followed. Non-members can sign up on the spot to become card carrying members of the IWW. The meetings operate under Rusty's Rules of Orderhttp://www.iww.org/oldbranches/US/CA/lagmb/lit/meeting.pdf and voting is based on a consensus system. History of union events The union had meetings with panhandlers once a month. Additionally, the union held demonstrations, primarily in the summer when there is a peak in panhandling activity. Since its formation the union has also held an annual May Day event in Ottawa. The earliest action the Panhandlers' Union participated in was the Homeless Action Strike in the summer of 2004. The strike was organized by a group of poverty activists. People were encouraged to pitch a tent on City Hall property with the intent of bringing attention to the issue of homelessness. The camp was originally set up on the Laurier St. entrance to city hall but was later moved to the Elgin St. entrance at the Human Rights Monument. On May 1, 2006, the Panhandlers' Union organized a May Day protest to shut down Rideau Street, and succeeded for more than one hour. The action targeted the Rideau Centre because of alleged incidents of violence against the homeless by mall security, two of which resulted in litigation. These alleged incidents included attacks against members of the union. Rideau Centre eventually settled the suit. The direct action also targeted the Safe Streets Act, which the Panhandlers' Union had criticized for being legislation which 'unfairly targets the poor. The action also targeted a by-law passed by Ottawa City Hall which outlawed selling newspapers on street corners. On the same day, Union members occupied the Elgin Street Police Station in Ottawa. In 2007, a coalition of businesses, social service providers, downtown residents and police launched a campaign urging an economic boycott of panhandlers. The union's 2007 May Day event targeted the Bank Street Business Improvement Area, which the organizers felt was complicit in targeting Union members and lobbying City Hall for legislation they wished to see pass. A rally was held outside of the BIA offices, with speeches on the issue of panhandling and poverty in Ottawa. Emotions were high during the protest because of recent comments made by Mayor Larry O'Brien comparing panhandlers to pigeons. The response by the union was to egg the offices of the Bank Street BIA. Organizers of the event said this was done because it's the exact behaviour to be expected of pigeons. Complaint against City of Ottawa The union prepared a complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Commission against the City of Ottawa in January 2009 after the latter erected a wrought iron fence to prevent union members from sleeping beneath an underpass. The fence was installed on the recommendation of the city's transportation committee in order to improve safety on the underpass, though Nellis argued that it in fact threatened the safety and security of those union members in Ottawa who relied upon its shelter in the winter. Nellis revealed in a statement at an Ottawa City Council meeting that a settlement had been made between the city and the OPU. There is a non-disclosure agreement in place so the exact details of the agreement are unknown. Andrew Nellis One of the original organizers of the OPU, Andrew Nellis was active with the union between 2005 and 2011. He was the spokesperson for the union for much of that time, which involved him meeting with Ottawa police and city councillors. Nellis was arrested on April 30, 2008, the day before the annual May Day march by the IWW and Ottawa Panhandlers Union. Nellis was allegedly caught by police trying to cut a lock on a gate in the pedestrian underpass close to the Rideau Centre. The gate had been recently put up by the City of Ottawa to prevent homeless people from sitting or sleeping under the bridge. Nellis was first held at the Elgin police station, where he was offered a deal to be released on bail with certain conditions. Nellis refused these conditions, and was transferred to Innes Road two days later. During his time in jail, Nellis began organizing his fellow inmates because of the poor conditions of the jail. This led to a front page article in the Ottawa Citizen about the Innes Road jail. When Nellis appeared in court on Elgin Street on May 1, 2008 a group concerned citizens entered the court and chanted \\"Andrew Nellis under attack. What do we do? Stand up, fight back!\\" The group was made up of OPW Union members, the homeless, Wobblies, members of People's Global Action Bloc Ottawa, and other Ottawa anarchists and activists. Nellis was released from jail 5 days later. The charges against him by the Crown Attorney were later dropped. Nellis ran in the 2010 Ottawa municipal election for Ottawa City Council in the Rideau- Vanier Ward. Nellis finished in 3rd with 462 votes.https://ottawacitizen.com/news/municipal-election/wards/rideau- vanier.html Municipal Election 2010 He is no longer spokesperson for the OPU and is pursuing a career as a tarot card reader.http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/windsors-panhandlers-and- street-performers-unionize-for-rights-everyone-else-has He has since started Street Labourers of Windsor (SLOW) which is an IWW-affiliated union including panhandlers, buskers, street people and the homeless in Windsor, Ontario.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/new-windsor-union-includes-city- s-panhandlers-and-buskers-1.3198909  References  External links * Youtube Channel Industrial Workers of the World in Canada Non-profit organizations based in Ottawa Trade unions in Ontario Trade unions established in 2003 Trade unions disestablished in 2009 ","title":"Ottawa Panhandlers' Union"},{"id":"21143591","title":"Russell Wilson"},{"id":"21143596","text":"John Arkison McIlwaine (12 June 1904 ‚Äì 24 April 1980) was a Scottish footballer who played as a centre half for Portsmouth, where he captained the team in the 1929 FA Cup Final, before moving to south coast rivals Southampton. He also played for Falkirk and Llanelly, whom he helped win the Welsh Football League championship in 1932‚Äì33. Football career =Falkirk= McIlwaine was born at Irvine, North Ayrshire and after a spell with Irvine Victoria he joined Falkirk. At Falkirk, he became one of the outstanding centre-halves in Scottish football and was selected to represent the Scottish League against the Irish League in October 1927 (the SFL won 2‚Äì1). He soon became a target for several top English clubs, and in February 1928 it \\"caused a sensation in the football world\\" when he chose to join Portsmouth who were struggling to avoid relegation in their first season in the First Division. =Portsmouth= McIlwaine joined Portsmouth for a record transfer fee of ¬£5000 (including a friendly match at Fratton Park), replacing Harry Foxall who retired shortly afterwards. He made his debut at home to Sunderland on 18 February 1928 in a 5‚Äì3 defeat (four of Sunderland's goals came from Dave Halliday), but retained his place for the remaining games that season as Pompey avoided relegation by one point. In the 1928‚Äì29 season, McIlwaine captained the team and led them to their first Cup Final, beating fellow First Division clubs, West Ham United and Aston Villa en route. In the final itself, despite dogged defending, Portsmouth were defeated by Bolton Wanderers with two late goals. The following year, McIlwaine lost his place at centre-half to Bob Kearney, who had been recently recruited from Dundee. At the end of the season, he was transferred to Southampton for a fee of ¬£2650; in his two and a half seasons at Fratton Park, McIlwaine played 62 games scoring 5 goals. =Southampton= McIlwaine was recruited to Southampton by manager Arthur Chadwick as a replacement for the ageing Bert Shelley, and made his debut on 30 August 1930, behind his former Portsmouth colleagues Willie Haines and Jerry Mackie, in a 5‚Äì0 defeat at Preston. Two games later, McIlwaine was injured and was unable to return until 29 November, when he was played at centre forward replacing Bill Fraser (who had taken over from Haines who was also injured). He scored twice in his first match at No.9 but after six matches (in which he scored five goals) Haines returned and McIlwaine reverted to centre half, replacing Shelley. McIlwaine retained the No.5 shirt for the rest of the season with the \\"Saints\\" finishing in mid-table. Chadwick resigned at the end of the season and was replaced by George Kay. After seven matches of the 1931‚Äì32 season, Kay dropped McIlwaine and recalled Shelley. For the remainder of the season, McIlwaine was in and out of the side, occasionally playing at centre forward. At the end of the season, an unhappy McIlwaine refused to sign a new contract and was placed on the transfer list at a fee of ¬£2500. No Football League clubs were interested, but Southampton refused to release his registration. Prevented from moving to another Football League club, McIlwaine moved to Wales in the 1932 close season, joining Llanelly of the Welsh League. McIlwaine spent the 1932‚Äì33 season at Llanelly, helping the team to win the Welsh League, before returning to Southampton in August 1933. On his return to The Dell, he found that his time in the lower league had not sharpened his game and he spent most of the 1933‚Äì34 season in the reserves. By the start of the following season, his confidence had returned and he reclaimed the centre half shirt from Arthur Bradford in mid- September. He missed only one match from September until the beginning of March, when he was once again used as a makeshift centre forward, replacing Norman Cole. In his eight appearances in the No.9 shirt he scored six goals, only two fewer than Cole had managed all season. Saints started the 1935‚Äì36 season (their fiftieth season since the club's foundation in 1885) with four wins and two draws from their first six matches, but were unable to sustain this form and in the period to the New Year they won only three more matches. One of these was the \\"golden jubilee\\" match against Tottenham Hotspur on 23 November 1935, when McIlwaine was captain in a 2‚Äì0 victory. In June 1936, after another poor season, in which the Saints finished in seventeenth place, nine members of the board resigned and manager George Kay left to take over at Liverpool, taking trainer Bert Shelley with him. Kay's position as manager was filled by the promotion of George Goss, the company secretary, who took charge of the team, with McIlwaine taking on the role of assistant manager. As well as his duties as assistant manager, McIlwaine continued as team captain and became first-team coach. In the first edition of the Southampton Football Echo of the 1936‚Äì37 season, the sports editor commented on the expansion of McIlwaines's \\"job description\\": > \\"It seems to me to be asking a tremendous lot of one man to be player, > captain and assistant manager. That looks to me to be an outsized man's job. > He will need all the good wishes possible, and he has mine.\\" After a year, in which he only made three further appearances, these new duties proved too much and in the summer of 1937, with Goss having handed over to Tom Parker in March, McIlwaine decided to leave. In his two periods with Southampton, McIlwaine made a total of 121 appearances, scoring 18 goals. Assistant manager at Grimsby Town In July 1937, McIlwaine became assistant manager at Grimsby Town under their newly appointed manager, the former England international defender, Charlie Spencer. Grimsby were then playing in the First Division and narrowly avoided relegation at the end of the 1937‚Äì38 season. The following season, Spencer had assembled a fine squad, including former Liverpool centre forward Fred Howe, Jimmy Boyd (who had won the FA Cup with Newcastle United in 1932) and Tommy Jones from Blackpool. Grimsby performed far better in the league, finishing in tenth place in the table, whilst in the FA Cup, they reached the semi-final against Wolverhampton Wanderers, having defeated fellow First Division team Chelsea in the previous round. The semi-final was played at Old Trafford on 25 March 1939 in front of a crowd of 76,962 spectators; this remains the record attendance at Old Trafford. In the semi-final, Grimsby were no match for Wolves and were \\"simply swept aside\\", going down 5‚Äì0, although their cause was not helped by having goal-keeper George Moulson injured early on in the match and having to play with only ten men and an outfield player in goal. McIlwaine remained at Blundell Park until 1948, when he left the club and opened a masseur practice in Grimsby. He remained in Grimsby for the rest of his life, dying there in April 1980, aged 75.

It is one of the short stories that TompkinsTompkins, J. M. S., The Art of Rudyard Kipling, London, Methuen, 1959 classifies as a tale of 'revenge', but it has elements of those classified as 'farce'. Plot summary Henry Augustus Ramsay Faizanne, \\"for the sake of brevity\\" called 'The Worm', is a subaltern newly arrived in India.to join the Second Shikarris (a fictional regiment in India). His brother junior officers \\"soften\\" him (i.e. bully him, to make him conform) until all become bored, except the Senior Subaltern. One day when the latter has played a practical joker on him, the Worm turns and bets a month's pay that when the Senior Subaltern is promoted to Captain, he (the Worm) will in turn play a joke on the Senior that he will never forget. The bet is accepted. After two months, the Senior Subaltern \\"gets his Company\\" (promotion), and at the same time becomes engaged to be married. One night in the hot weather, while the Senior Subaltern was singing the praises of his fianc√©e to the members of the Officers' Mess and their guests (wives), a voice is heard: \\"Where's my husband?\\" (Kipling's sense of farce shows: \\"four men jumped up as if they had been shot. Three of them were married men ... The fourth said that he had acted on the impulse of the moment.\\") The voice cries \\"O Lionel!\\", and all recognize the Senior Subaltern. The plot thickens, in that the woman - who obviously knows him well - seems not quite a lady. The Colonel is perturbed - the narrator says that watching the Senior Subaltern's face \\"was rather like seeing a man hanged, but much more interesting.\\" When she is challenged to produce her marriage certificate, she fetches a paper from her bosom, challenging \\"'my husband - my lawfully wedded husband - [to] read it aloud - if he dare!'\\". When he does, it says: \\"This is to certify that I, the Worm, have paid in full my debts to the Senior Subaltern...\\". All laugh hard at this - which \\"leaned as near to a nasty tragedy as anything this side of a joke can.\\" The Worm has established himself as a talented actor: he is elected president of the regiment's Dramatic Club, and spends his winnings on scenery and costume. He is now known as \\"Mrs Senior Subaltern\\" (for reasons of verisimilitude, Kipling is preserving the 'real names' of the characters in the Regiment), which is confusing when Lionel marries his real fianc√©e. :All quotations in this article have been taken from the Uniform Edition of Plain Tales from the Hills published by Macmillan & Co., Limited in London in 1899.

Born in Beulah, Victoria, Collins joined Victorian Football Association (VFA) club Coburg in 1935 and played 98 games for them, kicking 432 goals (including 116 goals in 1936), a club goal kicking record.Blueseum, \\"Lance Collins\\", http://www.blueseum.org/tiki- index.php?page=Lance+Collins Accessed 30 May 2012 Called \\"a fine athlete with a big leap and strong hands... a precise kick for goal, and a deadly snapshot on the run\\", Collins spurned offers from numerous VFL clubs and was appointed captain-coach of Coburg in 1940. He led Coburg to the 1941 VFA Grand Final where they lost to Port Melbourne by 19 points. Coburg went into recess in 1942 due to World War II and Carlton recruited Collins.Shaw, p. 143 Wearing guernsey number four, Collins made his VFL debut in Round three 1942 against Essendon at Windy Hill, kicking one goal.\\"AFL Tables\\", rlstats, http://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/1942/030519420523.html Accessed 17 January 2009 Collins played nine games in 1942, kicking 13 goals, and had played a further seven games, kicking 16 goals in 1943\\"Lance Collins\\", AFL Tables, http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/L/Lance_Collins.html#19423 Accessed 17 January 2009 before enlisting in the Australian Army on 22 June 1943.

Returning to Australia in 1945, Collins sought to continue playing for Carlton in the 1945 VFL season rather than return to Coburg, which Coburg initially refused and it was not until well into the season, after intense negotiations, that Coburg granted a transfer, and Collins was immediately named in the centre in Carlton's league side.Taylor, P. (1945) \\"Tests For Clubs\\", The Argus, 25 May 1945, p. 12 Collins kicked six goals in their Round 10 match against North Melbourne, which was said to \\"galvanise the side\\" and led ultimately to the 1945 premiership.Shaw, p. 94 Collins continued to play well throughout the season in either the forward line or on the ball and, known as a big game player, Collins was particularly important for Carlton in the 1945 finals series. He kicked eight goals in the first Semi-Final against North Melbourne (garnering the praise \\"His pace and anticipation in the final was electric\\")Shaw, p. 106 and four goals in the Preliminary Final against Collingwood. Collins lined up on a half forward flank for Carlton's victory in the 1945 VFL Grand Final but unfortunately tore tendons in his ankle early in the first quarter and, although he remained on the ground with his ankle strapped, played little further part in the match before being replaced at half-time.Shaw, p. 157 Club leading goalkicker in 1945 with 49 goals, Collins retired from VFL football to accept a coaching position with Tasmanian Football League side Sandy Bay, which he took to a premiership in 1946. He later accepted a coaching position with Ballarat Football League side Golden Point Football Club.Shaw, p. 222 At Golden Point there is evidence that Collins invented the checkside punt during the late 1940s, two decades before it was first used in the VFL.

In 2016, he was director of strategy for the campaign for the UK to remain in the EU. He previously served as a Member of South Africa's Parliament between 2004 and 2008, as CEO of South Africa's official opposition party, the Democratic Alliance between 2004 and 2009, and as the party's general election campaign chief in 2006, 2009, and 2011. He served as chief adviser to Western Cape Premier Helen Zille between 2009 and 2012. Background Coetzee holds a Bachelor of Arts and a Higher Diploma in Education, both from the University of Cape Town. Career in politics In 1997 Coetzee was picked by DP leader Tony Leon to head up the party's parliamentary operations at the age of 24. Leon subsequently noted Coetzee's appointment as \\"the most significant\\" he made during his 13-year tenure as leader of the party.Tony Leon, On The Contrary, 2008, Jonathan Ball, , pg. 298 From 1999, Coetzee was the party's chief strategist, playing a central role in the party's election campaigns,\\"Strategy is the steering wheel\\" which saw the DA grow from 1.7% in 1994 to 24.2% in the 2011 local government elections. In April 2004 Coetzee became a Member of Parliament, and was assigned the shadow health portfolio. Six months later he asked then President Thabo Mbeki during a Parliamentary debate whether he believed the high rate of sexual violence in South Africa contributed towards the spread of HIV, and whether the President actually believed HIV causes AIDS. Mbeki responded by accusing Coetzee of succumbing to the \\"disease of racism\\", but avoided responding directly, thus reigniting criticism of his government's response to the pandemic. In 2005, Coetzee was appointed the DA's CEO, in which role he radically reorganised the party and its finances, and designed and managed the 2006 local government election campaign and the 2009 general election campaign. In 2008, he oversaw a relaunch of the party designed to position it as a party of government, and not merely one of opposition. In 2009, Coetzee resigned as party CEO to become a Special Advisor to the Premier of the Western Cape and party leader Helen Zille, with a brief to co-ordinate government policy and strategy. He was succeeded as DA CEO by Jonathan Moakes. In September 2012, in a surprise move, Nick Clegg appointed Coetzee strategy director of the Liberal Democrats in Britain. In late October 2013 it was announced that Coetzee might return to South Africa and was being offered a Western Cape provincial cabinet post by the DA. However, in August 2014 he instead switched to a job at Liberal Democrat party HQ, becoming the General Election Director of Strategy, for which he was reportedly paid a salary of ¬£110,000. The Liberal Democrats faired very badly in the UK 2015 General Election, losing most of their seats. Coetzee is viewed as having led the party into oblivion. Writing for The Guardian after the result, Coetzee said, \\"We got routed by what I call the Fear. We presumed from the beginning that the Conservatives would try to scare voters with the prospect of a Miliband government that would risk the economy. But in the event the polls and the SNP conspired to ratchet up the Fear to Terror levels, because they showed Labour‚Äôs only path to power would be via the SNP.\\" During the summer of 2015, Coetzee joined Britain in Europe, the pro-European referendum campaign organisation. The campaign is seen as lacking in charismatic leadership. As Director of Strategy for the 'Stronger In' campaign, Coetzee was relatively quiet, writing publicly once in a South African newspaper to comment on the 2016 UK budget and difficulties within the UK Conservative Party. In the June 2016 referendum the UK voted to leave the EU, and Ryan Coetzee blamed the defeat in a tweet on \\"25 years of right wing tabloid propaganda\\". In 2020, Coetzee was reported to be heading up a ¬£5m marketing campaign for the Hong Kong government. This marketing campaign is the response of the Hong Kong Executive to the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests which has seen Hong Kong and China accused of reneging on the Sino-British Joint Declaration which had promised Hong Kong would be kept separate from China's authoritarian rule for 50 years from 1997.  Personal life  Coetzee has a son, Daniel Jackson Coetzee, born on 20 October 2006.
