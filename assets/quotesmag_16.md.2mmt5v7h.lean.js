The department ranks 11th on QS's 2018 world university rankings. History The Department of Physics at Imperial College dates back to the physics department of the Normal School of Science, later the Royal College of Science. As part of the formation of Imperial, the Royal College was moved into a new building at South Kensington in 1906, which also housed the Chemistry Department. From 1906 to 1932 the head of the Physics Department was Prof. H. L. Callender, famous for his work on the properties of steam. G P Thomson (son of J J Thomson) replaced Callender in 1932, and worked in part on nuclear physics and atomic weaponry. He was followed P. M. S. Blackett as head in around 1953, with the construction of the new Physics building starting at about the same time. Blackett refocused efforts from low-energy physics to high-energy nuclear physics, and under him research started into cosmic rays and the use of bubble chambers, with the first liquid hydrogen bubble chamber in Western Europe being constructed at the department. Work on satellite instrumentation resulted in departmentally designed equipment ending up on NASA satellites in 1962. Physics continued in the new ‚Äúold‚Äù RCS building until the new Physics building was finished in 1961, which subsequently became known as the Blackett Laboratory.Department History Accessed 28 January 2017 In 2019, it was announced that the laboratory would be constructing a magnetometer instrument for the European Space Agency Solar Orbiter in a mission to study the Sun. The satellite launched on an Atlas V from the Cape Canaveral AFS, Florida on the 9 February, 2020. In November 2019, a team of Imperial physicists was chosen to design parts of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, which is to be a long baseline accelerator neutrino experiment in the United States. Academics=Study=Undergraduate The department offers three year BSc and four year undergraduate MSci courses. The department has connections with universities in Europe, allowing undergraduate master's students to study-abroad during their course. All students graduating with an undergraduate degree from the department are also awarded the Associateship of the Royal College of Science, ARCS.

It includes notable figures involved in fitness instruction, training, education, fitness management and product development. The mission is to recognize and support fitness professionals for their dedication to helping others \\"Get Fit and Stay Healthy\\" and provide programs and services that helps all individuals achieve a better level of health and fitness. History John Figarelli founded the National Fitness Hall of Fame on December 2, 2004 to honor individuals and organizations who had made a lifetime contribution to health and fitness. Inductees are classed as pioneers, educators, instructors, sports medicine, celebrity spokespeople, and organizations. One of the criteria for membership is at least twenty-five years of service as a full-time Health and Fitness industry professional. Figarelli formed the National Fitness Organization, a corporation, in December 2004, with his wife, mother and father. They rented a small location in Sycamore, Illinois, to hold Figarelli's collection of fitness memorabilia, which would form the nucleus of the museum. The first class of 2005 had twelve members, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jack LaLanne and Charles Atlas. Other inductees included Joe Weider, Vic Tanny, Arthur Jones, Paul Bragg and Kenneth H. Cooper. The National Fitness Hall of Fame is the only institution in the nation that recognizes those individuals who pioneered the fitness industry, preservers fitness history and promotes the future of fitness in America. The fourth class of ten members was inducted in 2008 with a dinner, silent auction and ceremony, and was attended by many of the inductees. The ceremony was held at the Oak Meadows Golf Club in Addison, Illinois, and was hosted by Gilad Janklowicz of the television show Bodies in Motion. There were about 250 attendees. Inductees included Cory Everson, Tamilee Webb, Charles Kuntzleman, Michael Thurmond and others.

The Laval were one of the most powerful families of Maine during the Middle Ages and also had a presence in Brittany, where their prestige was similar to the one of the Rohan. The House of Laval played a significant role in Breton history and during the Hundred Years War and the French Wars of Religion. They also favored the French Renaissance in Northwestern France, building several ch√¢teaux. The last male heir died during the 17th century, and his possessions went to the House of La Tr√©moille. Fran√ßois de Laval was the first Roman Catholic bishop of Quebec; the city of Laval, Quebec, and the Universit√© Laval were named after him. Branches and titles The House of Laval appeared during the first quarter of the 11th century. Its origins are unclear and the first mentioned baron is Guy I. The direct branch became extinct in the male line in 1211, after the death of Guy VI. His sister, Edme, had previously married Matthieu II de Montmorency with a contract stipulating that her first son should take the Laval surname and arms. The branch of Montmorency-Laval died out in 1412 with Guy XII. His heiress, Anne, had married Jean de Montfort with a contract similar to Edme's one. Hence, her heirs took the name of Laval. The branch of Montfort-Laval started with Jean de Montfort, nicknamed Guy XIII of Laval, who died in 1415, and ended with Guy XVII in 1547. The branch of Rieux-Laval started with Louis de Sainte-Maure, who married the granddaughter of Guy XVI of Laval. This branch ended with Guy XX, killed in Hungary in 1605. The possessions of Laval passed to the La Tr√©mo√Ølle, who stopped the medieval tradition according which all the counts of Laval had to be called \\"Guy\\".

Most dramas reflect Turkish culture and are the country's most well known economic and cultural exports. Turkey is the world's fastest growing television series exporter and has currently overtaken both Mexico and Brazil as the world's second highest television series exporter after the United States. The television industry has played a pivotal role in increasing Turkey's popularity in Asia, Europe, Latin America, Middle East and North Africa. Turkish series are mostly produced in Istanbul, as television companies chose to settle there after the wave of liberalization for private television in the 1990s. Turkish television channels producing dramas include TRT, Kanal D, SHOW, STAR, ATV, FOX, tv8, and Kanal 7. The Turkish television series market is marked by stiff local competition: out of the 60 series produced every year in the country, almost 50% do not run for longer than 13 episodes due to the strong competition among the different local channels, resulting in the high quality and popularity of the longer-running productions. √áalƒ±ku≈üu was the first Turkish TV series exported internationally in 1986 to Russia. Turkish television shows are almost always available in multiple languages, dubbed or subtitled to accommodate the target country's language. The success of Turkish television series has boosted tourism as well, as visitors are keen to see the locations used for their favorite shows. The sudden and immense international popularity since the 2000s of Turkish TV dramas has been widely analyzed as a social phenomenon. Production Today, a season of the average Turkish drama is around 35-40 episodes. New episodes are filmed 6 days a week to keep up with the demanding production schedule, and crews can work up to 18 hours a day. Each episode of a popular Turkish drama today is usually between 120 and 150 minutes in length (excluding advertisements), which is much longer than a typical episode of an Americas or Western European series, which averages at around 30 to 60 minutes. However, when shown in the Balkans and southeastern Europe, episodes of Turkish dramas are usually split into shorter segments, usually not exceeding more than 60 minutes. International popularity=Turkey and Northern Cyprus= Turkey's first TV series was produced in 1974. The series was called A≈ük-ƒ± Memnu, which was adapted from the eponymous 1899 novel by Halid Ziya U≈üaklƒ±gil. The series was released on TRT, the public broadcaster of Turkey. The period of TV dramas on just TRT continued until 1986, being referred to in Turkey as the \\"single channel period\\" () and the shows themselves being called the \\"old TRT series\\" ().

Northern Cyprus has channels which Turkish language. But Northern Cyprus doesn't make TV series. They watch Turkish TV channels for shows. =Balkans and Southeastern Europe= Turkish TV shows are widely successful all over the Balkan Region. The most watched show in Bosnia and Herzegovina was Muhte≈üem Y√ºzyƒ±l (Magnificent Century). In Kosovo, the most popular TV shows in December 2012 were Fatmag√ºl'√ºn Su√ßu Ne? (What is Fatmag√ºl's Fault?), which ranked top of all programmes and A≈ük ve Ceza (Love and Punishment), which came in third according to data by Index Kosova. In Serbia, research from January 2013 indicates that the top two Turkish shows in TV were Muhte≈üem Y√ºzyƒ±l, which ranked fourth, and √ñyle Bir Ge√ßer Zaman Ki (As Time Goes By), which came in seventh. Serbian sociologist Ratko Bo≈æoviƒá explains this popularity by pointing at the traditional, patriarchal values of the Turkish shows, and the many cultural and linguistic similarities between Turkey and the Balkan countries: \\"The mentality depicted in those shows has to do with a traditional understanding of morality that people in Balkans remember at some level\\". According to him, all Balkan countries (Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Albania, Croatia etc) have seen dramatic changes in terms of family life, and the Turkish shows help them recall value systems that now seem lost. In North Macedonia, √ñyle Bir Ge√ßer Zaman Ki (As Time Goes By) ranked in January 2013 the top in terms of viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. In fact, Turkish shows are so successful in North Macedonia that the government has passed a bill to restrict broadcasts of Turkish series during the day and at prime time in order to reduce the Turkish impact on North Macedonia's society. They are also widely watched by Bulgarian viewers. Nova Televizia broke the record for viewer numbers when it started broadcasting the Turkish TV series Binbir Gece. The channel then decided to broadcast another Turkish show, Dudaktan Kalbe. The series Binbir Gece (One Thousand and One Nights) became a primetime hit in Bosnia, Montenegro and North Macedonia, as well as in Romania, Albania and Greece. It has increased the popularity of Istanbul as a tourist destination among Croatians, and led to a greater interest in learning Turkish. Other Turkish series that achieved great popularity in Croatia are Ezel starring Kenan ƒ∞mirzalƒ±oƒülu and Cansu dere (2009-2011), Muhte≈üem Y√ºzyƒ±l Halit Ergenc and Meryem Uzerli (2011-2014), Fatmag√ºl'√ºn Su√ßu Ne? starring Engin Aky√ºrek and Beren Saat (2010-2012), Adƒ±nƒ± Feriha Koydum Hazal Kaya and √áaƒüatay Ulusoy (2011-2012), Kuzey G√ºney (2011-2013) starring Kƒ±van√ß Tatlƒ±tuƒü, Buƒüra G√ºlsoy and √ñyk√º Karayel, Dila Hanƒ±m, K√º√ß√ºk Sƒ±rlar (2010-2011) and most recently Behzat √á. Bir Ankara Polisiyesi (2010-2013). In Slovakia, the popularity of Turkish series has improved the public image of Turkey itself. Turkish TV series are also popular in Greece. The Greek orthodox Bishop Anthimos has criticised Greek fans of Turkish TV series. Yabancƒ± Damat (The Foreign Bridesgroom) was one of the first Turkish series to become popular in Greece. = Arab world = Turkish TV series began to rise in popularity across the Arab world in 2008, when Waleed bin Ibrahim Al Ibrahim began buying up Turkish series for his Middle East Broadcasting Center (MBC). MBC is a popular Saudi Arabian broadcasting network. Instead of dubbing the shows in classical Arabic, they were rendered in Syrian Arabic, a dialectal variant readily understood by ordinary viewers across the Middle East. In a survey carried out in 16 Middle Eastern countries by the Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation, three out of four of those surveyed said they had seen a Turkish television series. Turkish series are in demand in the Arab world. They are prevalent on Egyptian television, and are popular among women in particular. Led by G√ºm√º≈ü (known as Noor in the Arab market), a wave of Turkish melodramas made their way onto Arab televisions, wielding a kind of soft power. The show violated the local conservative cultural norms, showing some Muslim characters drinking wine with dinner and engaging in premarital sex. The Arabic-dubbed finale of the Turkish TV series G√ºm√º≈ü (Silver), aired on August 30, 2008, was watched by 85 million viewers. In 2008, the grand mufti of Saudi Arabia Abdul Aziz al-Sheikh issued a fatwa against channels that broadcast G√ºm√º≈ü, saying anyone who broadcast it was \\"an enemy of God and his Prophet\\". In 2013, the most popular Turkish show is Fatmag√ºl'√ºn Su√ßu Ne?, A≈ük-ƒ± Memnu and Muhte≈üem Y√ºzyƒ±l. The most successful series in Turkey is A≈ük-ƒ± Memnu, which has broken rating records there. Fatmag√ºl'√ºn Su√ßu Ne? has increased the popularity in Istanbul as a tourist destination among Arabs. In 2015, K√º√ß√ºk Gelin was very popular, it was made by Samanyolu TV but unfortunately Samanyolu TV was shut down so K√º√ß√ºk Gelin didn't have a proper ending. Some Turkish series are more appealing to women, while some action series attract male audiences, which helps attract different types of advertisers for different viewerships. Some series have political overtones, including Ayrƒ±lƒ±k, which depicts the daily life of Palestinians under Israeli military occupation. Despite this, Islamic conservatives in many Middle Eastern countries have condemned certain Turkish series as \\"vulgar\\" and \\"heretical\\" to Islam. In March 2018, MBC pulled all Turkish dramas off the air. Nick Vivarelli of Variety considers this a result of the political tensions between Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The head of the Turkish Sales Company Global Agency, Izzet Pinto, made a statement to say that he believed this was a political decision against the Turkish government. =Pakistan= Turkish series are also popular in Pakistan. A≈ük-ƒ± Memnu, which has broken ratings records in Turkey, aired on the television channel Urdu1 in Pakistan, and has topped ratings being the most successful Turkish Series there.

The series opened with higher viewership, after three years the Turkish content begin its demand after Kosem Sultan's premier. Popularity of the Turkish serials was met by some difficulties: Pakistan's entertainment industry complained that the airing of Turkish and other foreign TV series diverts funding from local productions. Furthermore, A senate committee that oversees information and broadcasting has condemned such shows for their allegedly \\"vulgar content\\" and contrary to the Pakistan's Muslim traditions. It was also reported that TV series A≈ük-ƒ± Memnu, Fatmag√ºl'√ºn Su√ßu Ne?, Muhtesem Yuzyil and Adƒ±nƒ± Feriha Koydum.

Cennet, New Bride, Brave and Beautiful, The Girl Named Feriha, Our Story (Bizim Hikaye), The Promise (Yemin) are also very well received by audience =Bangladesh= In Bangladesh, Turkish series started becoming popular by the entrance of Muhte≈üem Y√ºzyƒ±l.

It doesn't require subtitles as they usually have the same or similar words and sentence structures. However Turkic languages more distant from Turkish, like the official languages spoken in Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan require subtitles as they have lesser degree of mutual intelligibility. The Turkish TV series are popular in these Turkic countries. =Iran= Ironically IRIB was the one that started everything off. IRIB TV3 used to air Sƒ±rlar D√ºnyasƒ± (Persian: ⁄©ŸÑ€åÿØ ÿßÿ≥ÿ±ÿßÿ±) which had very meaningful stories about things that may happen to you. This show was nothing like Turkish shows nowadays and instead promoted love and faith, it's been said that this show had more fans in Iran than in Turkey. After that Turkish shows got extremely popular in Iran during the early 2010s. They were dubbed into Persian by various satellite channels led by GEM TV. Among the most popular series were Muhte≈üem Y√ºzyƒ±l, A≈ük-ƒ± Memnu, Sƒ±rlar D√ºnyasƒ± and Fatmag√ºl'√ºn Su√ßu Ne. The loss of popularity in Turkish shows are because in recent years satellite channels that used to air these Turkish shows have been unstable and their dubs have gone down in quality. In addition to that the Iranian government has tried to stop the popularity of these shows by producing much more content itself and also by lifting restrictions on the country's private sector of entertainment where institutions like TGPCO, Honar Aval and TDH Film have been able to make movies and TV Shows more freely. Turkish shows are also simply too long to fit into the Iranian day to day life and have also been accused of promoting disloyalty, anger and backstabbing. =Elsewhere= State-owned television channels in Uzbekistan have removed Turkish TV series from their and because of the \\"rebellious nature\\" of some of the fictional characters.

You can also find a blog of Turkish Dramas in English. Its a fan blog here one can find Subtitles, episode summaries & cast in English for popular Turkish TV Series. Recently, this Blog gain much popularity by uploading reviews on √áarpƒ±≈üma The Crash TV Series. Strike In 2010, a season of Turkish TV series was 30-35 episodes long. Each week, one episode takes 6 days to make. It was 90 minutes in length. When TV series are broadcast, next 3-4th episode films concurrently. Actors and workers were on strike. So a Turkish TV series has got 2 crew concurrently. In 2016, a season of Turkish TV series was 35‚Äì40 episodes long. It is between 120 and 150 minutes in length. Actors and crews complained. Each series roughly consists of 40 episodes that last about 130 minutes, which translates into 5,200 hours of domestic TV content broadcast yearly. Demiray commented that Aa a screenwriter, \\"it was wonderful until about 10 years ago. Then I had to write a 60-minute episode per week, as opposed to today's 130-plus minutes. It has become a very mechanical and uninteresting process, just a question of keeping the melodrama going.\\" Cagri Vila Lostuvali, 10 years in the business and four as a director, adds: \\"To deliver one episode per week our crews work up to 18 hours a day. This job eats up our entire lives.\\" \\"With the increase of the episodes' duration and consequently the amount of working hours, the industry has lost its most experienced professionals who refuse to work in such conditions. Wages have not grown much either,\\" concludes Meric. To get a sense of proportion, it suffices to think about the process of developing a cinema script, which takes about two years and at least seven weeks to shoot 120 minutes of edited footage.  Business and finance  Turkish shows began expanding internationally in 1999, but only started to gain popularity in the early 21st century. In order to be able to produce high-quality content and to be competitive with the non-Turkish shows that were gaining traction in Turkey, more money was needed and the financial deficit was made up for through expansion to non-domestic markets. The Turkish government also played a role in motivating international expansion, creating incentive by granting awards and support to the companies that are most effective in exporting worldwide. In 2017, Turkish TV exports earned 350 million U.S. dollars, officially marking the country as the second largest drama exporter in the world behind the United States. According to the Secretary General of the TEA, Bader Arslan, Turkey's yearly income from TV exports will exceed 1 billion U.S. dollars by 2023.

What differentiates WASH United from other organizations working in the WASH sector is that WASH United does not use health-based messaging, but rather harnesses the power of fun, interactive gaming experiences, super star role models and strictly aspirational communication to change attitudes and behaviors on these issues. WASH United currently works in 8 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and in India. In Africa, WASH United works in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Mali, Tanzania and Uganda. WASH United is registered as a non-profit limited liability company (gGmbH) in Berlin, Germany, where the organization‚Äôs international headquarters are. WASH United recently opened a regional office.http://www.wash-united.org/ Background WASH United was founded in 2010 by Thorsten Kiefer. Kiefer, a devoted soccer fan, helped WASH gain attention at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa by coordinating promotions featuring soccer stars playing in the World Cup. Now, WASH United is still growing its ties with star athletes, as well as politicians, to help promote the club and achieve its goals. In 2012 they received the Sport for Health Award at the Beyond Sport Awards. As a registered United Nations non- governmental organization (NGO), in 2015 WASH United was granted special consultative status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). Purpose Access to safe and clean drinking water is a crisis that is both severe and receives an alarmingly small amount of attention by international media. In 2010, the lack of access to drinking water and toilets caused more deaths in children than HIV/AIDS, measles, and malaria combined. WASH United has the following goals: 1\\\\. To give toilets a \\"sexy\\" image. In hopes to increase attention around this issue, WASH United aims to spread an image that promotes desirability for toilets - an item that is seemingly commonplace and standard in developed countries. 2\\\\. To promote hand-washing. Many diseases and illnesses can be prevented by washing hands with soap and water, especially when handling food. Similarly, they wish to promote menstrual hygiene management, a topic that is highly taboo in certain cultures. 3\\\\. To encourage acknowledgement that safe drinking water and sanitization is a human right on an international level. Approach WASH United uses the following tactics to promote clean drinking water and hygiene: 1\\\\. Using fun and interactive games. People are more prone to remembering things when they can associate them with memorable activities such as storytelling and games. 2\\\\. Using sports stars and celebrities to gain attention and utilize their role model statuses to inspire people about this topic. 3\\\\. Focusing on the positives and why toilets and clean water are appealing, rather than the damaging impacts that come from a lack of these necessities. Future plans Currently, WASH United uses television, radio, and print media to communicate with its audience internationally. Moving forward, they plan to promote clean water and healthy hygiene habits through even more types of media as well as increase their presence in the types currently being utilized. WASH United plans to expand their organization by recruiting more star spokespeople and expanding both their relief efforts and media presence to more countries.

Avaste Fen, one of the largest fens in Estonia. A mire, peatland or quagmire is a wetland type, dominated by living peat-forming plants. Mires arise because of incomplete decomposition of organic matter, usually litter from vegetation, due to water- logging and subsequent anoxia. All types of mires share the common characteristic of being saturated with water at least seasonally with actively forming peat, while having its own set of vegetation and organisms. Like coral reefs, mires are unusual landforms in that they derive mostly from biological rather than physical processes, and can take on characteristic shapes and surface patterning. A quagmire is a floating (quaking) mire, bog or any peatland being in a stage of hydrosere or hydrarch (hydroseral) succession, resulting in pond-filling yields underfoot. Ombrotrophic types of quagmire may be called quaking bog (quivering bog). Minerotrophic types can be named with the term quagfen.https://pub.epsilon.slu.se/3014/1/SFS205.pdf There are four types of mire: bog, fen, marsh and swamp. A bog is a mire that due to its location relative to the surrounding landscape obtains most of its water from rainfall (ombrotrophic), while a fen is located on a slope, flat, or depression and gets most of its water from soil- or groundwater (minerotrophic). Thus while a bog is always acidic and nutrient-poor, a fen may be slightly acidic, neutral, or alkaline, and either nutrient-poor or nutrient-rich. Although marshes are wetlands within which vegetation is rooted in mineral soil, some marshes form shallow peat deposits: these should be considered mires. Swamps are characterised by their forest canopy and, like fens, are typically of higher pH and nutrient availability than bogs. Some bogs and fens can support limited shrub or tree growth on hummocks. The formation of mires today is primarily controlled by climatic conditions, such as precipitation and temperature, although terrain relief is a major factor, as water-logging occurs more easily on flatter ground. However, there is a growing anthropogenic influence in the accumulation of peat and peatlands around the world.A valley mire creates a level ground surface in otherwise dramatic topography. Upper Bigo Bog, Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda.Topographically, mires elevate the ground surface above the original topography. Mires can reach considerable heights above the underlying mineral soil or bedrock: peat depths of above 10 m have been commonly recorded in temperate regions (many temperate and most boreal mires were removed by ice sheets in the last Ice Age), and above 25 m in tropical regions.[7] When the absolute decay rate in the catotelm (the lower, water-saturated zone of a mire) matches the rate of input of new peat into the catotelm, the mire will stop growing in height.[8] A simplistic calculation, using typical values for a Sphagnum bog of 1 mm new peat added per year and 0.0001 proportion of the catotelm decaying per year, gives a maximum height of 10 m. More advanced analyses incorporate expectable nonlinear rates of catotelm decay. For botanists and ecologists, the term peatland is a more general term for any terrain dominated by peat to a depth of at least , even if it has been completely drained (i.e., a peatland can be dry, but a mire by definition must be actively forming peat). Global distribution Satellite image of burning tropical peat swamp, Borneo. In 1997 alone, 73000 ha of swamp was burned in Borneo, releasing the same amount of carbon as 13-40% of the mean annual global carbon emissions of fossil fuels. The majority of this carbon was released from peat rather than overlying tropical rainforest. Wooded bog in Lahemaa National Park, Estonia. 65% of mires in Estonia have been strongly affected or damaged by human activity in recent years. Extraction of peat from derelict blanket bog, South Uist, Scotland. This old bog is no longer forming peat because the vegetation has been changed, and therefore it is not a mire. Mires, although perhaps at their greatest extent at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, are found around the globe. Estimating the extent of mire land cover worldwide is difficult due to the varying accuracy and methodologies of land surveys from many countries. However, mires occur wherever conditions are right for peat accumulation: largely where organic matter is constantly waterlogged. The distribution of mires therefore depends on topography, climate, parent material, biota and time. The type of mire - bog, fen or swamp - depends also on each of these factors. The largest accumulations of mires, constituting around 64% of global peatlands, are found in the temperate, boreal and subarctic zones of the Northern Hemisphere. In polar regions, mires are usually shallow, because of the slow rate of accumulation of dead organic matter, and often contain permafrost. Very large swathes of Canada, northern Europe and northern Russia are covered by boreal mires. In temperate areas mires are typically more scattered due to historical drainage and peat extraction, but can cover large areas. One example is blanket bog where precipitation is very high (e.g. in maritime climates inland near the coasts of the north-east and south Pacific, and the north-west and north-east Atlantic). In the sub-tropics, mires are rare and restricted to the wettest areas. In the tropics, mires can again be extensive, typically underlying tropical rainforest (for example, in Kalimantan), although tropical peat formation occurs in coastal mangroves, as well as in areas of high altitude. Tropical mires largely form where high precipitation is combined with poor conditions for drainage. Tropical mires account for around 11% of peatlands globally (more than half of which can be found in Southeast Asia), and are most commonly found at low altitudes, although they can also be found in mountainous regions, for example in South America, Africa and Papua New Guinea. Recently, the world's largest tropical mire was found in the Central Congo Basin, covering 145,500 square kilometres and may store up to 30 petagrams of carbon. Mires have declined globally due to drainage for agriculture and forestry, and for peat harvesting. For example, more than 50% of original European mire area, more than 300000 km2, has been lost. Some of the largest losses have been in Russia, Finland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Poland and Belarus. Bio-chemical processes Diagram demonstrating the carbon cycle within peatlands. Mires have unusual chemistry, which influences inter alia their biota and the chemistry of the water outflow. Peat has very high cation-exchange capacity due to its high organic matter content: cations such as Ca2+ are preferentially adsorbed onto the peat in exchange for H+ ions. Water passing through peat declines in nutrients and in pH. Therefore mires are typically nutrient-poor and acidic unless the inflow of groundwater (bringing in supplementary cations) is high. Mires generally form whenever inputs of carbon exceed carbon outputs. This occurs due to the anoxic state of water-logged peat, and the process of photosynthesis by which peat grows. Due to this, mires are collectively a major carbon store, containing between 500 and 700 billion tonnes of carbon, despite accounting for just 3% of Earth's land surfaces. Carbon stored within mires equates to over half the amount of carbon found in the atmosphere. Mires interact with the atmosphere primarily through the exchange of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. The sequestration of carbon dioxide takes place at the surface via the process of photosynthesis, while losses of carbon dioxide occur through living peat tissue via respiration. In their natural state, mires are a slight atmospheric carbon dioxide sink through the photosynthesis of peat vegetation, which outweighs their release of greenhouse gases. In addition, most mires are generally net emitters of methane and nitrous oxide. The water table position of a mire influences its carbon release to the atmosphere. When the water table rises, for example after a rainstorm, the peat and its microbes are submerged under water and access to oxygen is inhibited, reducing respiration and carbon dioxide release. Carbon dioxide release increases when the water table shrinks, such as during a drought, as this supplies the aerobic microbes with oxygen to decompose the peat. Levels of methane also vary with the water table position and somewhat with temperature. A water table near the peat surface gives the opportunity for anaerobic microorganisms to flourish. Methanogens are responsible for producing methane via decomposition of the peat which consequently increases as the water table rises and oxygen levels are depleted. Increased temperatures in the soil also contributes to increased seasonal methane flux, though at a lower intensity. It is shown that the methane increased by as much as 300% seasonal from increased precipitation and temperature of the soil. Mires are important reservoirs of climatic information to the past because they are sensitive to changes in the environment and can reveal levels of isotopes, pollutants, macrofossils, metals from the atmosphere, and pollen. For example, carbon-14 dating can reveal the age of the peat. The dredging and destruction of a mire will release the carbon dioxide that could reveal irreplaceable information about the past climatic conditions. It is widely known that a plethora of microorganisms inhabit mires due to the regular supply of water and abundance of peat forming vegetation. These microorganisms include but are not limited to methanogens, algae, bacteria, zoobenthos, of which Sphagnum species are most abundant. The peat in mires contain a substantial amount of organic matter, where humic acid dominates. Humic materials are able to store very large amounts of water, making them an essential component in the peat environment, contributing to an increased amount of carbon storage due to the resulting anaerobic condition. If the peatland is dried from long-term cultivation and agricultural use, it will lower the water table and the increased aeration will subsequently release carbon content. Upon extreme drying, the ecosystem can undergo a state shift, turning the mire into a barren land with lower biodiversity and richness. The formation of humic acid occurs during the biogeochemical degradation of vegetation debris, animal residue, and degraded segments. The loads of organic matter in the form of humic acid is a source of precursors of coal. Prematurely exposing the organic matter to the atmosphere promotes the conversion of organics to carbon dioxide to be released in the atmosphere.  Anthropogenic uses  Mires are used by humans for a range of purposes, the most dominant being agriculture and forestry, which accounts for around a quarter of global peatland area. This involves cutting drainage ditches to lower the water table with the intended purpose of enhancing the productivity of forest cover or for use as pasture or cropland. Agricultural uses for mires include the use of natural vegetation for hay crop or grazing, or the cultivation of crops on a modified surface. In addition, the commercial harvest of peat from mires for energy production is widely practiced in Northern European countries, such as Russia, Sweden, Finland and the Baltic states. The clearing of tropical mires for anthropogenic uses is an increasingly pressing issue in Southeast Asia, where opportunities for the production of palm oil and timber for export are leading primarily developing nations to exploit mires for economic purposes. Tropical peatlands comprise 0.25% of Earth‚Äôs terrestrial land surface but store 3% of all soil and forest carbon stocks and are mostly located in low-income countries. The exploitation of these ecosystems, such as the draining and harvesting of tropical peat forests, continues to result in the emission of large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In addition, fires occurring on peatland dried by the draining of peat bogs releases even more carbon dioxide. The economic value of a tropical peatland used to be derived from raw materials, such as wood, bark, resin, and latex; the extraction of which did not contribute to large carbon emissions. Today, many of these ecosystems are drained for conversion to palm oil plantations, releasing the stored carbon dioxide and preventing the system from sequestering carbon again. The planned Carbopeat Project will attempt to assign economic value to the carbon sequestration performed by peat bogs to stop the exploitation of these ecosystems. Moreover, records of past human behaviour and environments can be contained within mires. These may take the form of human artefacts, or paleoecological and geochemical records.  Tropical mires  The global distribution of tropical mires is mostly concentrated to Southeast Asia where agricultural use of peatlands has been developed in recent decades. Large areas of tropical peatlands have been cleared and drained for food and cash crops such as palm oil plantation. Large scale drainage of these plantations often results in subsidence, flooding, fire and deterioration in soil quality. Small scale encroachment on the other hand, is linked to poverty and is so wide spread that it as well has a negative impact on these peatlands. The biotic and abiotic factors controlling the Southeast Asian peatlands are completely interdependent. Its soil, hydrology and morphology are created by the present vegetation through the accumulation of its own organic matter where it builds a favorable environment for this specific vegetation. This system is therefore vulnerable to changes in hydrology or vegetation cover.Hooijer, A., Silvius, M., W√∂sten, H. and Page, S. 2006. PEAT-CO2 , Assessment of CO2 emissions from drained peatlands in SE Asia. Delft Hydraulics report Q3943. Furthermore, these peatlands are mostly located in developing regions with impoverished and rapidly growing populations. The lands have there for become target for commercial logging, paper pulp production and conversion to plantations through clear-cutting, drainage and burning. Drainage of tropical peatlands alters the hydrology and increases their susceptibility to fire and soil erosion, as a consequence of changes in physical and chemical compositions. The change in soil strongly effects the sensitive vegetation and forest die-off is common. The short-term effect is a decrease in biodiversity but the long-term effect, since these encroachments are hard to reverse, is a loss of habitat. Poor knowledge about peatlands sensitive hydrology and lack of nutrients often lead to failing plantations where pressure increases on remaining peatlands. Sustainable forestry in these peatlands is possible by cutting large trees and letting smaller individuals flourish but instead clear-cutting and burning to enable monocultural plantation of non-indigenous species is the predominant strategy. Northern peatlands were mostly built up during Holocene after the retreat of Pleistocene glaciers but in contrast the tropical ones are often much older. Nakaikemi Wetland in southwest Honshu, Japan is more than 50,000 years old and has a depth of 45 m. The Philippi Peatland in Greece has probably one of the deepest peat layers with a depth of 190 m. Tropical peatlands are suggested to contain about 100 Gt carbon and is corresponding to more than 50% of the carbon present as CO2 in the atmosphere. Accumulation rates of carbon during the last millennium were close to 40 g C/m2/yr. = Greenhouse gases and fires = The tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia only cover 0,2% of earths land area but CO2 emissions are estimated to 2 Gt per year which is equal to 7% of the global fossil fuel emissions. These emissions get bigger with drainage and burning of peatlands and a severe fire can release up to 4000 t of CO2/ha. Burning events in tropical peatlands are becoming more frequent due to large scale drainage and land clearance and in the past 10 years, more than 2 million ha was burnt in Southeast Asia alone. These fires last typically for 1‚Äì3 months and are releasing large amounts of CO2. Indonesia is one of the countries suffering from peatland fires, especially during years with ENSO- related drought, an increasing problem since 1982 as a result of developing land use and agriculture. During the El Ni√±o-event in 1997-1998 more than 24,400 km2 of peatland was lost to fires in Indonesia alone from which 10,000 km2 was burnt in Kalimantan and Sumatra. The output of CO2 was estimated to 0.81‚Äì2.57 Gt, equal to 13‚Äì40% of global output from fossil fuel burning. Indonesia is now considered the 3rd biggest contributor to global CO2 emissions, caused primarily by these fires.Silvius, M., Kaat, A.H., Van de Bund and Hooijer, A. 2006. Peatland degradation fuels climate change. An unrecognised and alarming source of greenhouse gases. Wetlands International, Wageningen, The Netherlands. With a warming climate these burnings are expected to increase in intensity and number. This is a result of a dry climate together with an extensive rice farming project, called The Mega Rice Project, started in the 1990s where 1 Mha of peatlands was converted to rice paddies. Forest and land was cleared by burning and 4000 km of channels drained the area.Boehm, H.-D. V., Siegert, F., Rieley, J. O. et al (2001). Fire impacts and carbon release on tropical peatlands in central Kalimantan, Indonesia. 22nd Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, 5‚Äì9 November 2001, Singapore. Centre for Remote Imaging, Sensing and Processing (CRISP), University of Singapore. Drought and acidification of the lands led to bad harvest and the project was abandoned in 1999. Similar projects in China have led to immense loss of tropical marshes and fens due to rice production. Drainage, which also increases the risk of burning, can cause additional emissions of CO2 by 30‚Äì100 t/ha/year if the water table is lowered with only 1 m. The draining of peatlands is probably the most important and long lasting threat to peatlands all over the world but especially in the tropics. Peatlands do release the greenhouse gas methane that has strong global warming potential, but subtropical wetlands have shown high CO2 binding per mol of released methane, which is a function that counteracts global warming. = Biology and peat characteristics = The vegetation of tropical peatlands varies with climate and location. Three different characterizations are mangrove woodlands present in the littoral zones and deltas of salty water, followed inland by swamp forests. These forests occur on the margin of peatlands with a palm rich flora with trees 70 m tall and 8 m in girth accompanied by ferns and epiphytes. The third one, Padang, from the Malaysian and Indonesian word for forest, consists of shrubs and tall but thin trees and appear in the center of large peatlands. The diversity of woody species, like trees and shrubs, are far greater in the tropical peatlands than in peatlands of other types. The peat in the tropics is therefore dominated by woody material from trunks of trees and shrubs and contain little to no sphagnum moss that dominates in boreal peatlands. It‚Äôs only partly decomposed and the surface consists of a thick layer of leaf litter. Forestry in peatlands leads to drainage and rapid carbon losses since it decreases inputs of organic matter and accelerate the decomposition. In contrast to temperate wetlands the tropical peatlands are home to several species of fish. Many new, often endemic, species has been discovered lately but many of them are considered threatened.  Impacts on global climate  Wetlands provide an environment where organic carbon is stored in living plants, dead plants and peat, as well as converted to carbon dioxide and methane. Three main factors giving wetlands the ability to sequester and store carbon are the high biological productivity, high water table and low decomposition rates. Suitable meteorological and hydrological conditions are necessary to provide an abundant water source for the wetland. Fully water-saturated wetland soils allow anaerobic conditions to manifest, storing carbon but releasing methane. Wetlands make up about 5-8% of Earth‚Äôs terrestrial land surface but contain about 20-30% of the planet‚Äôs 2500 Gt soil carbon stores. Mires, (e.g., bogs, fens and marshes) are the wetland types that contain the highest amounts of soil organic carbon, and can thus be considered peatlands (a peat layer >30 cm). Wetlands can become sources of carbon, rather than sinks, as the decomposition occurring within the ecosystem emits methane. Natural peatlands do not always have a measurable cooling effect on the climate in a short time span as the cooling effects of sequestering carbon are offset by the emission of methane, which is a strong greenhouse gas. However, given the short \\"lifetime\\" of methane (12 years), it is often said that methane emissions are unimportant within 300 years compared to carbon sequestration in wetlands. Within that time frame or less, most wetlands become both net carbon and radiative sinks. Hence, peatlands do result in cooling of the Earth's climate over a longer time period as methane is oxidised quickly and removed from the atmosphere whereas atmospheric carbon dioxide is continuously absorbed. Throughout the Holocene (the past 12,000 years), peatlands have been persistent terrestrial carbon sinks and have had a net cooling effect, sequestering 5.6 to 38 grams of carbon per square metre per year. Today, it has been estimated that northern peatlands, on average, sequester 20-30 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Peatlands insulate the permafrost in subarctic regions, thus delaying thawing during summer, as well as inducing the formation of permafrost. As the global climate continues to warm, wetlands could become major carbon sources as higher temperatures cause higher carbon dioxide emissions. Compared with untilled cropland, wetlands can sequester around two times the carbon, and planted wetlands may be able to store 2-15 times more carbon than what they release. Carbon sequestration can occur in constructed wetlands, as well as natural ones. Estimates of greenhouse gas fluxes from wetlands indicate that natural wetlands have lower fluxes, but man-made wetlands have a greater carbon sequestration capacity. The carbon sequestration abilities of wetlands can be improved through restoration and protection strategies, but it takes several decades for these restored ecosystems to become comparable in carbon storage to peatlands and other forms of natural wetlands. = Effects of drainage for agriculture and forestry = Due to their significance in the global soil-atmosphere exchange of carbon, the movement of carbon between mires and the atmosphere is an important current issue in ecology and biogeochemical studies. The drainage of peatlands for agriculture and forestry has resulted in the emission of extensive greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, most notably carbon dioxide and methane. By allowing oxygen to enter the peat column within a mire, drainage disrupts the balance between peat accumulation and decomposition, and the subsequent oxidative degradation results in the release of carbon into the atmosphere. As such, the drainage of mires for agriculture transforms them from net carbon sinks, to net carbon emitters. However, the emission of methane from mires has been observed to decrease following drainage. When undertaken in such a way that preserves the hydrological state of a mire, the anthropogenic use of mires' resources can avoid significant greenhouse gas emissions. However, continued drainage will result in increased release of carbon, contributing to global warming. As of 2016, it was estimated that drained peatlands account for around 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and forestry. = Fires = Mire drainage or drying due to climactic factors may also increase the risk of fires, presenting further risk of carbon and methane release into the atmosphere. Due to their naturally high moisture content, pristine mires have a generally low risk of fire ignition. The drying of this waterlogged state means that the carbon-dense vegetation becomes vulnerable to fire. In addition, the oxygen poor nature of the vegetation causes peat fires to smoulder beneath the surface, causing incomplete combustion of the organic matter and resulting in extreme emissions events. In recent years, the occurrence of wildfires in peatlands has increased significantly worldwide, but particularly in tropical regions. This can be attributed to a combination of drier weather and changes in land use which involve the drainage of water from the landscape. This resulting loss of biomass through combustion has led to significant emissions of greenhouse gasses both in tropical and boreal/temperate peatlands. Fire events are predicted become more frequent with the warming and drying of the global climate. = Palm oil plantations = Oil palm is increasingly becoming one of the world‚Äôs largest crops, rapidly expanding in the past years. In comparison to alternatives, oil palm is considered to be among the most efficient sources of vegetable oil and biofuel, requiring only 0.26 hectares of land to produce 1 ton of oil. Thus, palm oil has become a popular cash crop in many low-income countries, providing economic opportunities for communities. With palm oil as a leading export in countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia, many smallholders have found economic success in palm oil plantations. However, the land sequestered for plantations are typically substantial carbon stores promoting biodiverse ecosystems. Oil palm plantations have replaced much of the forested peatlands in Southeast Asia. Historically, these regions have been seen as a dead space, but estimates now state that 12.9 Mha, or about 47% of peatlands in Southeast Asia, were deforested by 2006. In their natural state, peatlands are waterlogged, with high water tables, making for an inefficient soil. To create viable soil for plantation, the mires in tropical regions of Indonesia and Malaysia are drained and cleared. The peatland forests being harvested for palm oil production serve as above and below ground carbon stores, containing at least 42,000 Million metric tonnes (Mt) of soil carbon. This exploitation of land raises many environmental concerns, namely greenhouse gas emissions, risk of fires, and a decrease in biodiversity. The greenhouse gas emissions for palm oil planted on peatlands is estimated to be between the equivalent of 12.4 (best case) to 76.6 t CO2/ha (worst case). In their natural state, peatlands are resistant to fire. Drainage of peatlands for palm oil plantations creates a dry layer of peat that is especially vulnerable to fires. As peat is carbon dense, fires occurring in compromised peatlands release extreme amounts of both carbon dioxide and toxic smoke into the air. Thus, these fires not only add to emissions of greenhouse gases, but also cause thousands of deaths every year. The decrease in biodiversity, due to deforestation and drainage, creates a vulnerable ecosystem. Homogenous ecosystems are at an increased risk to extreme climate conditions, and are less likely to recover from fires.  Management and rehabilitation  Rehabilitation projects undertaken in North America and Europe usually focus around the rewetting of peatlands and revegetation with native species. This acts to mitigate carbon release in the short term, before the new vegetation growth provides a new source of organic litter to fuel the peat formation process in the long term. The United Nations Convention of Biological Diversity targets highlights peatlands as key ecosystems to be conserved and protected. The conventions requires governments at all levels to present action plans for the conservation and management of wetland environments. Wetlands are also protected under the 1971 Ramsar Convention. = Global Peatlands Initiative =ReferencesExternal links * Category:Environmental terminology Category:Fluvial landforms Category:Freshwater ecology Category:Pedology Category:Types of soil Category:Wetlands ","title":"Mire"},{"id":"38233686","text":"Gaon Tasa Changla Pan Veshila Tangla was a Marathi film released on 21 October 1985.

There is no known cardiac or intellectual involvement. Presentation The incidence of this disease is not precisely known but it is considered to be rare (< 1/106 population). It has been reported in 15 families to date mostly from Canada, Finland and France. This disease usually presents between the ages of 5 to 10 years old. The usual picture is with weakness involving the upper legs and affects activities such as running and climbing stairs. As the condition progresses, patients tend to experience weakness in their lower legs and arms. Some remain able to walk in advanced age, while others require assistance in adulthood. Genetics This disorder is inherited in a recessive X linked fashion. As a result, males are much more commonly affected than females.It is due to a mutation in VMA21 gene - the human homolog of the yeast Vma21p protein. This gene is located on the long arm of chromosome X (Xq28). It is an essential assembly chaperone of the vacuolar ATPase - the principal mammalian proton pump complex. Mutations in this gene increase lysosomal pH. This in turn reduces lysosomal degradative ability and blocks autophagy. Pathology The muscle fibers are rarely necrotic but have evidence of excessive autophagic activity and exocytosis of the phagocytosed material. They have increased variation in size and are predominantly composed of round small and hypertrophic fibers. The vacuoles are strongly reactive for dystrophin and lysosome associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2). Membrane bound vacuoles and balls of dense material under the basal lamina are present. Deposition of the C5b-9 complement attack complex, subsarcolemmal deposition of calcium and expression of MHC1 complex also occur. On electron microscopy characteristic balls of dense material are commonly seen. The vacuoles may contain remains of mitochondria, membrane whorls and calcium apatite crystals.

Stones collected from riverbeds were affixed to the slopes of raised kofun and other burial chambers. They are considered to have descended from forms used in Yayoi-period tumuli. They are common in the early and mid-Kofun periods, but most late Kofun-period tumuli do not have them. Origin and ancestry What are thought to be proto- fukiishi at Nishidani kofun No. 3 in Izumo, Shimane Tombs covered with fukiishi appear sporadically in Western Japan from the mid-Yayoi period and continue into the Kofun period. Fukiishi are thought to be one element of the characteristics of the period of kofun at the time that they were making their first appearance; what are thought of as the oldest examples of what was to lead the generally fixed form are seen at and the presumed slightly older in the city of Sakurai in Nara Prefecture. Neither fukiishi nor haniwa accompany mounds from before regularization such as at the . The ' () seen at the (\\"four corner projections type grave mound\\") in the San'in region in Western Japan are often put forth as an ancestor of '. The perimeter of the foot of kofun No. 3 of in Izumo in Shimane Prefecture is completely covered with '. The burial mound at the archaeological site in the city of S≈çja in Okayama Prefecture is surrounded with rows of stones; such examples are widely seen in the San'in and the nearby San'y≈ç regions, where examples of burial mounds demarcated by stacks of stone walls are also seen. Terminology In his report on an excavation in 1915 on mound No. 21 of Saitobaru kofungun burial mound group in what is now the city of Saito in Miyazaki Prefecture, historian titled an entry ' (\\"surface roofing stones\\") in which he described the condition of the ' in a ground plan and cross-section. The term ' came into use as an archaeological term largely due to the influence of book ' (\\"Kofun and ancient culture\\", 1922). Via examples of kofun in the Kinai capital region Takashi described the ' there as serving both practical and decorative purposes: in practical terms the use of pebbles provided protection from the wind, rain, and cold, while the stones served to beautify the mound which was after all built above ground to attract public attention and to impress and rouse piety in visiting worshippers. Research Misaki, Okayama Prefecture Kani in Gifu Prefecture is roofed with fukiishi made up of riverbed stones. Excavation of fukiishi themselves was nearly nonexistent before World War II. It was only after the war that scientific examination, verification, and surveying of the stones took place. In 1953, led a group of specialists, locals, and students in an excavation at the in Misaki in Okayama. The group surveyed three quarters of the kofun, with a height of 10 m and a diameter of 60 m. The report published in 1960 gave the extent of distribution, shape and size, petrological analysis, technical analysis of the roofing method, and minute illustration the configuration of the individual stones. The report estimated the number of stones at about 80,000. In response to the rapid increase in the post-war period of large-scale development that led to in the destruction of historical ruins, urgent excavations were carried out with the goal of thorough examination rather than as the preservation of documentation. As a result of this early research, Sh≈çz≈ç Haraguchi and published a paper in 1967 on the excavation of tumulus C1 of the Bentenyama kofungun group in Takatsuki in Osaka. The paper notes the results of investigation into the stacking methods, the weight and number of stones per unit area, the collection areas and transportation routes of the stones, and other details. stated that following this report hardly any other resulting from such an accumulation of verifiable details on fukiishi has appeared. Research into fukiishi has come to require knowledge related to construction technology. To enable the scientific qualification and quantification of research documentation, Hisanori Ishizuka has called for research on: # Palaeoecology # Soil mechanics # Structural engineering # Materials # Fukiishi construction # Structural masonry Materials and construction methods The material for fukiishi was often made up of pebbles and stones from dry riverbeds. In the case of pebbles, a variety of stones was used. For example, the late-4th-century in Kashiwara in Osaka Prefecture was made with andesite flagstones in vertical or sloped piles. Other sites used chert, sandstone, slate, basalt, or other types of stone. Embankments were often made with soil transported from other areas. Pollen analysis of the fifth- and sixth-century kofuns of the Kuboizumi-Maruyama Historic Sites in Saga has shown clear disparities in the vegetation in the soil of the mound faces and that of the surrounding environment. This example suggests that the borrow pits for the construction of the mounds were in remote locations. = Stone Building Methods = Among different methods of stone tomb construction, it was found that there are four different classifications of burial mound structures.  Type 1  These buildings include a stacked stone wall with thick backfill and lack a base stone in the construction. The typical examples of burials in this style are Nakayama Otsuka Kofun (Nara Prefecture Tenri City), Hokeno Mountain Burial Mound (Sakurai City, Nara Prefecture), and in the rear section of the former Inari Tomaru, Kyoto, these are the oldest structures still present in Yamato.  Type 2  This construction method is characterized by the dual-staged stacking of the stone base. The basal stone is stacked horizontally and the subsequent masonry is stacked on top. These mounds tend to exhibit steep inclines of 30 degrees or more. Prime examples of this type of burial mound are found in Red Tsuchiyama Tumulus in the Tenri City of Nara Prefecture and Xizhiduka Mound and the Miwa Mountain Burial Mound 1 in Tsuyama City Okayama Prefecture.  Class 3-1  \\"Stacking Stone\\" is the classification of this type of stone, the basement stones are overlapped with the main body of the structure. The Benten Mountain Mound (C1) in Takatsuki City, Osaka Prefecture is a representative example of this style of mound building.  Class 3-2  This type of burial mound does not stack stone layers over the foundation. Instead, the stones are embedded in the soil in a method referred to as \\"pasting stones\\".  Class 3-3  Construction technology changes as current methods fuse with local methods. Examples of this can be found in Kashiwabara City at Mt Tama 1 and Tama 7 (Tamane Mountain Burial Mounds).  Class 4  This method of construction follows the \\"paste stone\\" method in Class 3-2. Mounds generally displays shallow inclines of 20-25 degrees. The mounds consist mostly of small stones with gravel filled gaps; which is generally found in the Saki Gouzanyama Kofun (Saki Gouran Mountain Burial Mound) in Nara City, Nara Prefecture. Purpose and function Kawai in Nara Prefecture Half of the restored mound is covered with fukiishi. The purpose of ' is seen, as in Kenji Takahashi's account of 1922, to protect the burial mound while projecting its majesty. As they were used primarily on slopes and rarely on flat surfaces it is also thought they may have served to prevent runoff, and may have contributed to waterproofing and drainage. They may also have been used to imply the mound was sacred, holy ground and clearly differentiate it from adjacent areas. Archaeologist notes the use of ' may be related to a desire to make royalty visible and exhibit the people's connection with royalty, a feature he sees as characteristic of Japanese burial mounds in comparison with those of other Asian countries, and in particular in the case of keyhole-shaped kofun. Demise Restored kofun at Kumano shrine in Fuch≈´ in Tokyo The scale of kofun construction peaked in the middle of the Kofun period in the mid-5th century, reflecting the power and influence of the political structure and the social status of the entombed via the form and scale of the tumuli. Towards the close of the 5th century, the construction of large keyhole-shaped kofun and groups of layered kofun waned. At the beginning of the 6th century, the scale of most keyhole-shaped kofun west from the Kant≈ç region became smaller, the smaller (\\"satellite\\") tumuli began to disappear, and fukiishi began to be used infrequently. Three-tiered kofun saw a strong decrease in favour of two-tiered ones. Outside of the Kant≈ç region, haniwa stopped being used. From the end of the 6th century to the beginning of the 7th, the tumuli of the monarchs changed from square h≈çfun tumuli to octagonal tumuli. Amongst these, dome-shaped grave mounds made with fukiishi, such as in Fuch≈´ in Tokyo, are noteworthy. Nevertheless, during this era kofun were quickly ceding the role of central ritual building to Buddhist temples, and the adoption of rammed earth construction techniques stands out. With regards to , ' stones lined up to trace the line of the mound are recognized, and what could be called fukiishi are almost never seen. ' were not piled on the mounds as fukiishi were, nor were the construction techniques of fukiishi applied to them. Aoki has pointed out that this was modeled on the decoration techniques of the foundations of Buddhist temples.

Cl√©rico is credited with reviving the popularity of the Moulin Rouge over the course of fifty years. Cl√©rico was born in Paris, France, on March 18, 1929. In 1928, his father, Joseph Cl√©rico, a glassmaker, had moved to Paris from the Piedmont region with his brother, Louis Cl√©rico. The brothers had opened a Parisian glass shop. Joseph and Louis made much of their family's fortune during the German occupation of Paris during World War II, when there was a shortage of glassmakers in the city. The Cl√©ricos were hired to make glass for cities throughout France and Germany which had suffered bombing damage. They had both acquired considerable wealth through their repairs by the end of the war. The brothers purchased the Le Lido cabaret on the Champs-√âlys√©es in 1946. In 1955, Joseph and Louis purchased the Moulin Rouge. They upgraded the kitchens and marketed the venue as a tourist destination. Still, the Moulin Rouge continued to suffer from financial distress by the early 1960s. Jacki Cl√©rico took over the Moulin Rouge in 1962 from his father, Joseph. Cl√©rico built a new aquarium for performances, expanded the auditorium, and introduced professional theater backdrops and scenery. His first revue, \\"Frou-Frou,\\" opened to sold out audiences in 1963. From that point on, Jacki Cl√©rico only opened revues beginning with the letter \\"F\\" in keeping with a superstition that the letter brought luck beginning with \\"Frou-Frou\\". His other revues, included Frisson (1965), Fascination (1967), Fantastic (1970), Festival (1973), Follement (1976), Fr√©n√©sie (1979), Femmes, Femmes, Femmes... (1983), followed this tradition. The music of these revues was composed by Henri Betti. In 1989, Clerico opened \\"Formidable\\" to mark the 100th anniversary of the Moulin Rouge. Guests included Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. The Moulin Rouge began to lose popularity again during the 1990s. Cl√©rico continued to produce the Moulin Rouge's trademark revues, but the cabaret nearly went bankrupt in 1997. The last show that Cl√©rico produced was \\"F√©erie\\" in 1999, which featured one hundred dancers. The release of Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge! in 2001, which starred Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, and Jim Broadbent, revived the club's popularity. The Moulin Rouge is now marketed as a family- oriented destination. Jacki Cl√©rico turned over the day-to-day operations of the Moulin Rouge to his son, Jean-Jacques Cl√©rico, during his later years. He served as the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Moulin Rouge until shortly before his death. Cl√©rico died on January 13, 2013, at the age of 83.

He is best known for his large scale concrete murals and public works of art from the 1960s and 1970s. His work is often of an abstract or stylised nature with its roots in the traditions of craft and \\"buildability\\". His use of heavily modelled surfaces created a distinctive language for his predominantly concrete and glass reinforced concrete (GRC) sculptures. After long years of neglect, many of William Mitchell's remaining works in the United Kingdom are now being recognised for their artistic merit and contemporary historic value, and have been granted protective, listed status. Life and career William Mitchell was born in April 1925 in London's Maida Vale. Serious illness in his early years and extensive periods in hospitals and convalescent homes, resulted in virtually no schooling. Part of the mural at the entrance to Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral In 1938 Mitchell was apprenticed to an established London firm of decorators, where he was taught the basics of the trade, and developed a taste for the history and tradition of the craft. A three-year period of service in the Royal Navy followed after which he got a job painting scenes and panoramic views for the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes (NAAFI), refurbishing and decorating their clubs and canteens across the world. After working for the Pearl Insurance Company as an Insurance Agent, Mitchell earned and saved enough money to pay for a more formal art education. After studying at The Southern College of Art in Portsmouth and then at the Royal College of Art in London between 1953 and 1957 where he studied woods, metals and plastics and won both a Silver Medal and the Abbey Award entitling him to a fourth post-graduate year at the British School at Rome. Upon his return from Italy, (where he had spent time in the offices of Gio Ponti, Pier Luigi Nervi and Pininfarina), Mitchell replied to a newspaper advertisement for a designer or artist to assist the London County Council, LCC, Architects Department to design and produce decorative works for the many new developments then springing up across the City. His appointment as a Design Consultant to the LCC enabled Mitchell to work with some of the UK's most respected builders, architects and engineers of the time including Sir Frederick Gibberd, Sir Basil Spence, The Building Design Partnership and Sir Ove Arup. From the 1950s, Mitchell produced work for a wide variety of clients. His initial appointment at the London County Council allowed him to set up his own company in the early 1960s, a company which at one point employed over 40 skilled craftsmen and artists. Mitchell gained a reputation for reliability during this period, and this would help him develop a style that became known throughout Britain and internationally, with his work appearing on schools, public housing, public subways, civic gardens, shopping centres and religious buildings. Part of Mitchell's reliefs on Quayside Tower Mitchell's interest in experimentation, resulted in a wide range of projects that varied in both finish and style and which included the use of recycled timber and old furniture to create mosaics; the use of recycled glass, melted down and recast; the use of poured resin and polyurethane to add colour and the use of contemporary construction materials such as GRP (Glass reinforced plastic) and GRC (Glass reinforced concrete) to create large scale panelled installations. He was one of the few artists to investigate Faircrete, a John Laing developed concrete product that could be carved whilst still wet, retaining these shapes once dry. His 1973 Stations of the Cross at Clifton Cathedral in Bristol are examples of this work. At Clifton Cathedral, Mitchell also made the fibreglass designs for the original ceremonial doors (now replaced), as well as the Lectern. Mitchell also designed the huge internal concrete wall for the reception area at the Lee Valley Water Works in North London. This was reputed to be the largest single cast ever undertaken at that time and featured on the front cover of Concrete Quarterly magazine in Winter 1964. It was later granted grade II listed status. A number of in-depth articles and features in the UK construction press helped to confirm Mitchell's reputation within the industry including Concrete Murals, in Concrete Quarterly in Summer 1963,http://www.concretecentre.com/PDF/cq_057.PDF and ‚ÄúDesigner, Craftsman, Genius‚Äù in The Architect issue of December 1975. Mitchell appeared on several editions of the BBC show Tomorrow's World. In one appearance he explained a proposal for attaching a series of photoelectric cells to the 30m high flank wall of the Piccadilly Plaza Tower in Manchester. In the 1980s Mitchell went to work in Qatar for the Royal Families designing and building both the Qatar Zoo and the extensive Doha Corniche waterfront promenade. He also worked for the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) in San Francisco, USA where he was responsible for designing and constructing many of the decorative panelling and sculptural installations at a number of stations across the system. The 1980s also saw Mitchell in Honolulu, Hawaii where he created the modelled surroundings of the Civic Square. Mitchell spent many years as artistic design adviser to Mohammed Al Fayed, and was responsible for the overall design and for the carving and modelling of the panels for the Egyptian Hall and the Egyptian escalator at Harrods. He also designed Innocent Victims, the statue of Diana, Princess of Wales, and Dodi Fayed at Harrods. Other projects in which Mitchell was involved whilst working for Al Fayed, but that never got off the ground, included a footbridge over the River Thames linking Craven Cottage stadium to the southern shore, and a Harrods-themed hotel-and- experience proposal for the Las Vegas Strip. Mitchell was a member of the Design Advisory Board, Hammersmith College of Art, Trent Polytechnic, Formwork Advisory Committee and the Concrete Society, and was a regular on the construction lecture circuit, both in his home country and abroad (especially the U.S.), being described as a \\"doyen of British muralists\\" at a presentation he gave in 2007 to the Tile and Ceramics Society. He died in Cumbria, England, in January 2020 at the age of 94.

It opened in 1938 and closed in October 2012. History=Initial use= The need for the building followed the Local Government Act 1929 and the transfer of welfare functions from poor law unions to county and county borough councils. It was built by Essex County Council and was designed by John Stuart who held the position of County Architect from 1920 to 1945. The land was purchased from New College, Oxford and development began in 1933. Building work was undertaken by H. Arnold and Sons and the foundation stone was dated 1935. The opening ceremony was held in 1938 and it was named Suttons Institution. The placename 'Suttons' was an old manor in Hornchurch, believed to refer to the location south of the main settlement. The initial primary use was as a home for the elderly, with provision for children, nursing mothers and psychiatric care. =World War II= It was used as residential accommodation for airmen based at nearby RAF Hornchurch during the Second World War. It was also an auxiliary civilian facility to Oldchurch Hospital as part of the Emergency Hospital Service and formed part of Sector 1 of the London system. =National Health Service= Following the National Health Service Act 1946 it joined the National Health Service as St George's Hospital under the control of the Romford Group Hospital Management Committee in 1948. Legionella was found in the hospital's water system in October 2012; the patients were transferred to other hospitals and St George's Hospital closed. Plans are in place for a new health centre on part of the site, with the remaining land converted to a housing development called St George's Park.

This differs from a natural circulation boiler which relies on current density to circulate water inside the boiler. In some forced circulation boilers, the water is circulated twenty times the rate of evaporation.Boilers Operators Handbook Second Edition Graham and Totman pg 58 In water tube boilers, the way the water is recirculated inside the boiler before becoming steam can be described as either natural circulation or forced circulation. In a water tube boiler, the water is recirculated inside until the vapor pressure of the water overcomes the vapor pressure inside the stream drum and becomes saturated steam. The forced circulation boiler begins the same as a natural circulation boiler, at the feed water pump. Water is introduced into the steam drum and is circulated around the boiler, leaving only as steam. What makes the forced circulation boiler different is its use of a secondary pump that circulates water through the boiler. The secondary pump takes the feed water going to the boiler and raises the pressure of the water going in. In a natural circulation boilers, the circulation of water is dependent on the differential pressures caused by the change of density in the water as it is heated. That is to say that as the water is heated and starts turning to steam, the density decreases sending the hottest water and steam to the top of the furnace tubes. In contrast to the natural circulation boiler, the forced circulation boiler uses a water circulation pump to force that flow instead of waiting for the differential to form. Because of this, the generation tubes of a forced circulation boiler are able to be oriented in whatever way is required by space constraints. Water is taken from the drum and forced through the steel tubes. In this way it is able to produce steam much faster than that of a natural circulation boiler  Types = LaMont = One example of a forced circulation boiler is the LaMont boiler. Such boilers are used in cases where there is high pressure, above 30 megapascals.Springer Handbook of Mechanical Engineering 10 Volume Karl- Heinrich Grote, Erik K. Antonsson part C 16.24 = Clayton = The Clayton forced-circulation steam generator does not have a steam drum in the typical sense. A series of small tubes that are part of one giant coil, usually made of steel, have feed water pumped through at great speed. The water is pumped from the top of the steam generator down to the bottom and out. The tubes that are arranged in such a way that the combustion gasses pass around the tube subsequently heating the water. Essentially, the arrangement can be best described as having a large thin walled coil of pipe wrapping around the circumference of a vertical steel drum looping around and down until it reaches the bottom. As only some of the water may become steam, it is important to separate the two and send any water back through to absorb more heat. If this separation does not occur, the damage to the system could be costly. If steam goes through the generation tubes inside, the tubes may overheat and become weak, and if water is allowed down into the steam system, corrosion, water hammer, or other ill effects may occur. To combat this, after exiting the steam generator, the mixture is put through a centrifugal steam separator which does exactly that producing steam that is above ninety-nine percent dry saturated steam. If superheated steam is desired, an additional coil is run back through the steam generator. To maintain a constant level of water in the steam separator, the feed pump in conjunction with a leveling system is utilized. A great advantage to this system is that steam can be generated very quickly. However, the downside to this system is the complete dependence on a constant supply of feed water. Without the constant supply, the system may be subject to a massive and expensive damage  Advantages  * The evaporator tubes may be built in any orientation. Natural circulation requires vertical piping whereas the forced circulation ensures flow in any direction. * The walls of the tube may be built smaller due to the greater tolerance of higher pressure losses. * The general forced circulation boiler has a low circulation ratio of range between three and ten. The circulation ratio is how much steam is produced per how much feed was put in. Natural circulation boilers have a huge range of circulation ratios all the way from five to one hundred. Disadvantages * The forced circulation boiler requires more power and water than a natural circulation boiler. This is due to the electrical requirements of the pump forcing circulation and the amount of water being circulated through the tubes. * The additional parts required; steam drum, circulation pump, and orifices to limit flow, cause a forced circulation boiler to lead to increased cost as well as increased opportunities for failure which gives them a lower reliability than natural circulation. * The pump must be beneath the steam drum to take advantage of the pressure due to the height of the water. If the pump was not there; when it reaches the steam separator and water returns to the pump, the pressure may become low enough in the eye of the impeller to cause cavitation and subsequent damage. * Since there are two pumps, controlling them and having them work in sync and cooperation proves difficult. * The boiler is not able to produce super-critical pressures because the steam generation is not dependent on pressure differences  See also  * Benson boiler * supercritical steam generator References Category:Boilers ","title":"Forced circulation boiler"},{"id":"38234309","text":"Fortune Global Forum is an annual conference held by Fortune magazine.

The buildings on the seafront are mostly of Georgian architecture dating from the period he was in power. It is a Grade I listed monument. History General view of the area around the King's Statue Weymouth was much enjoyed by the King George III who would often take holidays there ‚Äì a total of fourteen separate occasions, the first in 1789. With his patronage of the town, the king changed the fortune of Weymouth, and a lot of the buildings along the seafront are mostly of Georgian architecture during the king's reign. George III was originally advised to travel to Weymouth to consolidate his recovery from his first bout of serious physical and mental illness, sometimes now interpreted as porphyria. The court came with the King, and the national papers reported the event. As a result of the king's interest in the area, it was decided that Weymouth should have a statue in tribute to him. The idea was first raised in 1802 and a statue was soon designed and made ‚Äì based on the designs of architect James Hamilton. However, the plan was put on hold after the king fell ill in 1805, with the structure being locked away. The year 1809 marked the 50th anniversary of the king's ascension to the throne, which caused the statue to be erected in place. During the commissioning of the statue, plans were for the statue to be situated lower down and in front of a building, where the full quality of the work would be appreciated. However, the statue's location ended up being high and out of range. It was erected at the junction of the town's two main streets, St. Mary Street and St. Thomas Street. Today the statue remains on an island in the centre of the road close to the seafront. At first, the statue was delivered to Weymouth and assembled by the supplier four years before it was erected in its present position. Despite attempts to remove it, the statue remains a focal point of the town. In the early 20th century it became a gathering for public ceremonies and coronation celebrations. When the statue's location became a traffic island in the late 1950s, its role as a central gathering place was lost. In 2007/8, the statue was restored following vandalism, seaside weather, and 200 years of accumulated paint and dirt. Weymouth and Portland Borough Council, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, had awarded the contract for the monument's restoration to Osirion Building & Conservation Ltd. It was renovated by stripping 20 layers of paintwork, replacing it with new paints and gold leaf, and replacing the iron framework with a stainless steel one. Design The statue's figures and detail are in Coade stone, reported to be the work of the firm Coade and Sealy, on a massive Portland stone pedestal. The King is dressed in Garter robes, whilst holding a sceptre in his right hand. He is backed by various the crown on a cushion, the Royal standard and Union flag, a pile of books and a large oval shield of arms. One each side is a further low pedestal which sits a lion and a unicorn. The front inscription reads \\"The grateful Inhabitants, to George the Third on his entering the 50th Year of his Reign.\\" The statue was originally painted bronze and only became multi-coloured as late as 1948. The monument has not always been fully appreciated, where a long Southern Times report of January 1886, reviewing the unveiling of the statue to Sir Henry Edwardes, the journalist contrasted the new statue with \\"...that hideous monstrosity known as the King's Statue, about the removal of which many schemes have been from time to time suggested.\\" References Category:1809 establishments in England Category:1809 sculptures Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1809 Category:Buildings and structures in Weymouth, Dorset Category:Tourist attractions in Weymouth, Dorset Category:Grade I listed buildings in Dorset Category:Statues in England Category:Monuments and memorials in Dorset Category:Cultural depictions of George III Category:Grade I listed monuments and memorials Category:Sculptures of men in the United Kingdom Category:vandalized works of art in the United Kingdom ","title":"King's Statue"},{"id":"38234443","text":"Josh Wood is a British hair colourist.

The name of the band stems from singer-songwriter Yen-Hwei Anetzberger. \\"Yen-Hwei\\" means \\"Abundant grace\\" in Mandarin. Yen in Berlin 2013  History  Yen was formed by a chance meeting between singer Yen-Hwei Anetzberger and guitarist Christian F√ºtterer at the end of 2003. Yen had already written some lyrics and Christian was in a band called Skrunge with his brother Steffen and bassist/drummer Benjamin Heckmann. Their initial samples were successful and in early 2004, the group decided to continue working together under the name of Yen. In 2006, Yen was nominated for the German Rock and Pop prize. In 2007, singer Yen reached the top 20 in the finals of Stefan Raab's music show SSDSDSSWEMUGABRTLAD. Yen has produced three albums and three singles in total and is signed to the Frankfurt indie label MX Records. Yen became recognized in Germany as a female pop singer in 2007. Yen also collaborated on the debut album of the band Eschenbach, which was produced by Stephan Weidner and released in November 2009, with the song \\"Frag Dich Selbst\\" (English: Ask Yourself). As a result of the positive response to the track, Yen contributed to the CD \\"Autonomie\\" Stephan Weidner and provided background vocals for the songs \\"Sterne\\" (stars), \\"Niemand Hier\\" (Nobody here) and \\"Hafen\\" (harbour).  Music  The English lyrics in Yen's current albums are mostly autobiographical, and form a common thread running through the songs. A central theme is desire. The rock and alternative genre also inspired Yen to venture into exploring popular realms. This led to the recent single \\"Deep Space Night\\" in collaboration with the Mannheim music producer and songwriter Philippe van Eecke, who has also composed for such artists as Simple Plan and Yvonne. In August 2009, their first unplugged recording was released under the name \\"Sofa ‚Äì so good\\" and can be considered as a homage to their summer tour.

Background  Before this war Zeta was governed by ƒêuraƒë II Bal≈°iƒá. His wife Jelena Bal≈°iƒá was firmly opposed to his pro-Venetian policy and to his sales of Scutari, Drivast, and other towns together with islands on Skadar Lake to the Venetians in 1396. She did not approve Venetian obstruction of contacts between local Eastern Orthodox Christians with the Metropolitanate of Zeta and the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá, and also the fact that Venetians were cutting off Eastern Orthodox monasteries around Skadar Lake from their legally valid income and possessions. In addition to that, an aggressive trading policy of Venetians in the region significantly reduced Zeta‚Ä≤s earnings. She had significant influence on the way her son Bal≈°a III governed Zeta after the death of ƒêuraƒë II. Even before the First Scutari War she was in dispute with Venetians about the jurisdiction of Zetan Orthodox Metropolitanate over the orthodox churches around the river Bojana and the Church of St. Peter in Scutari. In front of Venetians Bal≈°a III, based on Jelena's instructions, protected the ancient rights of the Serbian church and Zetan Metropolitan bishop appointed by the Patriarchate of Peƒá.  Bal≈°a's supporters  After ƒêuraƒë II died in 1403, Bal≈°a III took over control of Zeta and with Jelena‚Ä≤s support started an eight years long war against Venice in 1405. Jelena and Bal≈°a apparently started the war without much preparations hoping they would soon easily receive international support. They especially counted on support of the Serbian Despot and Dubrovnik, the supporters of emperor Sigismund who had territorial aspirations in Dalmatia. These hopes were not justified. In January and again in March 1405 they first approached Dubrovnik for help, but were politely rejected. Bar During this war, Bal≈°a was not fully supported by urban population of Bar and Ulcinj whose business interests were somewhat better preserved with good relations with powerful the Venetian Empire. His main supporters were warrior nobility in Zeta, pronoiers in the Scutari region, and Serb and Albanian peasants unsatisfied with taxes. The ƒêura≈°eviƒá family participated on Bal≈°a's side, Koja Zaharia and Dhimiter Jonima supported Venetians, while Dukagjinis were neutral.  Beginning of the war  The war began in 1405 when Bal≈°a took advantage of the rebellion of local population in the region of Scutari and captured all Scutari region (including Drivast) except the Scutari fortress itself. It is uncertain if he inspired the revolt which started in early 1405, but he certainly utilized it. Radiƒç Humoj and many other most distincted local Venetian pronoiers (like Nika Bogoje, Petar Konte, Nikola Lumbardini, Andrija Sklavo, and Nikola Sigeci) deserted Venice and supported Bal≈°a III in order to save their position and property. Bal≈°a was intolerant of local nobles who would not support him and many of those who would dare to desert him were captured and crippled, i.e. deprived of a limb and nose. Venetians in return captured the three most important ports of Zeta: Bar, Ulcinj, and Budva. They also offered 500 ducats for the person who would kill Jelena Bal≈°iƒá and her son Bal≈°a III. The reward was later increased to 2,000 ducats. Bal≈°a found himself in a difficult situation because the Ottoman Empire (a possible ally against Venice) was weakened after the Battle of Ankara in 1402, and his ally the Serbian Despot was involved in the Ottoman civil war. To make things even worse, Sandalj Hraniƒá intended to capture the whole Gulf of Kotor. In such circumstances Bal≈°a decided to accept Ottoman suzerainty, which included a regular tribute payment to the sultan. In early 1407 Bal≈°a married Mara, a daughter of Niketa Thopia who had good relations with the Republic of Venice and since then became a mediator during the war. In 1407 representatives of the Venetian Republic and Bal≈°a III met on the territory in possession of Ratac in an attempt to negotiate peace. During negotiations held in June 1408, the Venetians insisted to keep Ratac in their possession. Still, peace negotiations were not successful.  Peace treaty of 1409  Michele Steno, a Doge of Venice met Jelena during peace negotiations In 1409 Jelena decided to go to Venice to personally negotiate a peace. At the end of May she arrived in Dubrovnik but had to wait for almost two months because her hosts warned her on the presence of the Neapolitan galleys in Adriatic Sea. While she was waiting in Dubrovnik on 9 July 1409 Venice purchased the Dalmatian coast from Ladislaus of Naples for 100,000 ducats. This made Jelena's negotiating position very difficult. At the end of July she finally arrived in Venice. Because of the long voyage she was financially broken so the Venetians had to support her with three ducats a day during negotiations which lasted for three months. On 26 October 1409 a year-long peace agreement was signed without territorial changes for any of the parties. Jelena traveled back to Zeta through Dubrovnik where she received 100 ducats worth of presents. Although both her and Michele Steno, a Doge of Venice, swore on the Gospel to respect the peace agreement, there was no peace in reality.  Continuation of the war  Venetians directly broke the peace agreement they signed with Jelena when they refused to pay agreed provisions to Bal≈°a who in return attacked their possessions in early 1410. His fleet captured the whole Skadar Lake and forced Venetian fustas to retreat. In mid 1410 there was another rebellion in Scutari. After this rebellion Bal≈°a III besieged Scutari and plundered its surrounding. When Niketa Thopia was defeated and captured by Teodor II Muzaka at the end of 1411 Bal≈°a divorced Mara because her imprisoned father was of no use to him anymore. At the end of 1412 or beginning of 1413 he married Bolja Zaharia, a daughter of Koja Zaharia who already married his other daughter to one of ƒêura≈°eviƒái. Members of ƒêura≈°eviƒá family held the most distincted positions on the court of Bal≈°a III. To bring Koja even more close Bal≈°a appointed him as castellan of Budva.  Aftermath  Both parties were unsatisfied with the peace treaty and believed that the other party was in breach of the agreed terms and that the other party should pay more for the damage during the war. It seems that Venice continued to jeopardize the rights of the Orthodox Church in the region of Skadar Lake. In such circumstances even a small conflict like a minor dispute between Hoti and Matagu≈æi (two clans who lived north of the Skadar Lake, on the border of Zeta and Venetian Scutari) over pasture lands started chain of events which led to the new war. Although Bal≈°a III judged in favour of the Matagu≈æi clan, Hoti attacked them and captured the disputed lands. Matagu≈æi killed four Hoti clansmen during the counter-attack. Hoti complained to Bal≈°a, who rejected their complaints with the words \\"You've got what you deserve!\\" (). Two of disappointed Hoti's chieftains who led a minor part of the clan decided to leave Bal≈°a and requested to be accepted under the Venetian suzerainty. At first Bal≈°a himself advised the Venetian governor in Scutari to accept them because he wanted to divide them from the rest of Hoti tribesmen. When he became aware of their eventual influence on the rest of Hoti tribesmen who remained loyal to him he changed his mind and insisted that Paolo Quirin should reject their request. In November 1414 the Senate instructed Paolo Quirin to ignore Bal≈°a‚Ä≤s advice and to grant Venetian citizenship to Hoti renegades. In response Bal≈°a purchased weapons for his forces which in early spring 1415 attacked and burned village Kalderon near Scutari. Based on Senate's instructions Venetians bribed the leader of the major group of Hoti (Andrija Hot) to accept Venetian suzerainty. By accepting Bal≈°a's refugees, Venetians violated their previous agreements with Bal≈°a who then decided not to respect their agreements anymore. He began to collect taxes on Venetian goods, confiscate Venetian grain, rob Venetian ships on Bojana and to prepare a military campaign against Hoti who organized a preventive attack against him at the beginning of 1418. In October 1418 Venetians started to confiscate goods owned by merchants from Ulcinj to compensate Venetians traders. In autumn 1418 Bal≈°a decided to start a new war. He employed a Venetian garrison of about 50 mercenaries who guarded the Scutari fortress before they switched sides and went to Bal≈°a. Bal≈°a also arrested all Venetian citizens who were caught on the territory of Zeta. In March 1419 he started a new war‚Äîthe Second Scutari War.

He is also an executive chairman of TransAfrica Capital and the Ichikowitz Family Foundation. Early life and education Ichikowitz was born in the mining town of Springs, South Africa, where he experienced first-hand the country's transition. His father, Louis, imported Suzuki motorcycles, setting the foundation on which Ichikowitz would later build his own company. Ichikowitz studied drama at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa. During his time at university he became involved with protest theatre, before travelling throughout Africa and studying African literature.  Career  During the past twenty years, Ichikowitz has developed a number of businesses including defence and aerospace, mining, oil and gas, agriculture and sustainable development, property, retail and tourism. Ichikowitz founded the Paramount Group in 1994, to operate in the global defence, internal security and peacekeeping industries. The group operates in countries in the Middle East, South America and Africa, as well as in India. It manufactures a range of armoured vehicles and deals in surplus South African military equipment, including fighter aircraft. In 2011 the Paramount Group launched the Advanced High Performance Reconnaissance Light Aircraft, due to take its first flight in 2013. In addition to his role at Paramount Group, Ichikowitz is the executive chairman of private equity group TransAfrica Capital, which invests in scientific research and development projects.  Controversy  Ichikowitz has been criticised for being a \\"close ally\\" of the ruling African National Congress (ANC), and for providing President Jacob Zuma with an aircraft to use for an ANC fundraising and business trip to Lebanon and Kazakhstan. Another flight by Zuma to the United States on an aircraft owned by Ichikowitz in 2011 caused considerable controversy when the cost (R6.3 million) was questioned in parliament. The official presidential aircraft, operated by the South African Air Force, was not available for the flight. Ichikowitz has also been criticised for his involvement in the controversial Oil-for-Food Programme in the aftermath of the Gulf War.  Philanthropic interests  Ichikowitz is the founder of the Ichikowitz Family Foundation, established in 2010. The Foundation is actively involved in wildlife conservation of endangered species, especially the protection of Africa's rhinos and elephant population.

She founded the National Women's Party of Turkey. Established in 1972 and banned in 1980 during the military takeover of the Government, TUKP was the first all-women Turkish political party. Goktuna served as the founder of the party and its leader throughout the party's existence. TUKP's main purpose was to increase the presence of women in politics and especially in the Turkish Parliament. By 1977, TUKP had established offices in three cities (Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir) with several branches in Istanbul. The number of delegates had exceeded 500. However, TUKP was never able to participate in any general elections because they did not meet the minimum requirement of being established in 12 cities. Although they had plans to open 9 new offices, the military coup of September 12, 1980 halted all activities. Goktuna was under house arrest for a period of one month following the coup. Eventually, TUKP was shut down by the new military government, which was the same for all other political parties, never to resume activities again. Since then, Goktuna attempted several times to re- establish the party but without success. Nevertheless, she was recognized as being the first woman to lead a political party in the Republic of Turkey. Mubeccel Goktuna died of natural causes on October 3, 1999. She is buried in the Karacaahmet cemetery in Istanbul, Turkey.

Acapella Audio was founded by Alfred Rudolph and Herman Winters in 1978 in Duisburg, Germany. Acapella is famous for its heavy horn-loaded speakers that are able to reproduce the whole audible sound spectrum. Other signature characteristic for the products of the company is the widely utilized plasma tweeter technology. The company‚Äôs flagship product, the Sph√§ron Excalibur has earned the company worldwide recognition. Standing at over seven feet tall and weighing 2,728 pounds, this $455,000 speaker is considered one of the world‚Äôs most unusual speakers.  History  In 1961 while a student at architecture school, Alfred Rudolph made and designed 4-way speakers with an appealing sound. But after many sessions listening to the sound of trumpets, he became fascinated by the wide and vivid sound of them; this is when the idea of creating a modern trumpet came to the mind of Rudolph. In 1976, Alfred Rudolph and Hermann Winters met, both immediately felt the same fascination with the idea of the trumpet. Two years later, Acapella Audio Arts officially launched.  Technologies = The Ion-Plasma Tweeter = The Ion-Plasma Tweeter is designed to recreate the most accurate, fastest and most sophisticated sound compared to the existing speakers in the world. When operating, the ion-beam fires plasma into oxygen in the air which can produce reactive by-products, Acapella is the only speaker company that eliminates this problem and is certified for health safety by the European Union (EU). In this way, the Acapella ion tweeter is able to reproduce sound without membrane and without mass. In terms of transient capabilities and phase stiffness, the obtained sound quality cannot be realised by using conventional tweeters. With virtually zero mass, the ion tweeter can reproduce frequencies as high as 100 kHz, though in this case, it's limited to 30 kHz. =The Spherical Horn= Though the senior firm of the two, Acapella is actually not nearly as internationally famous as their colleagues at Avantgarde Acoustic. Both German companies are in the hornspeaker business but Acapella, as the older one, claims credit for being the spherical horn inventors (they began in 1978). The Avantgardists under the lead of Matthias Ruff meanwhile produce strikingly similar horns.

It covers boats between 2.5 and 24m, personal watercraft, engines and a number of components built since 1998. It ensures their suitability for sale and use in Europe. The 2013 Directive is usually referred to as RCD2 to differentiate it from the 1994 original. History Directive 94/25/EC was the first piece of harmonised legislation in the EU to regulate the boating industry throughout Europe. It was brought in to harmonise the safety requirements related to the design and construction of boats across Europe. The Directive allowed for the creation and emergence of a single market for boats, personal watercraft, marine engines and components in the EU. The Directive was revised in 2003 with the adoption of Directive 2003/44/EC. This amending directive brought personal watercraft within the scope of the Directive, as well as introducing new requirements for noise and low limits for exhaust emissions for marine engines. Directive 94/25/EC on recreational craft, as amended by 2003/44/EC, is currently being revised by the EU institutions. The European Commission's proposal will bring the Directive into line with the New Legalislative Framework, as well as bringing in stricter exhaust emissions limits and clarifying the concept of private importer. The proposal was published by the European Commission in July 2011 and is currently under discussion in the European Parliament and Council of the European Union under the ordinary legislative procedure. The proposal is likely to be adopted in the course of 2013. Content Directive 94/25/EC, as amended by 2003/44/EC, applies to new and second hand recreational craft from 2.5m to 24m in length, personal watercraft, marine propulsion engines and components placed on the market for the first time after 1998. Products excluded from the scope of the Directive include: canoes, kayaks, gondolas, pedalos, sailing surfboards, surfboards, racing boats, historical craft, craft built for own use provided that they are not subsequently placed on the market during a period of five years, commercial vessels carrying passengers (covered by separate legislation), submersibles, air cushion vehicles, hydrofoils, and external combustion steam powered craft. Products falling within the scope of the Directive must comply with the essential requirements set out in the Annex I. These include requirements for the design and construction of crafts such as boat design categories, craft identification, the owner's manual, as well as integrity, structural and installation requirements. Other requirements apply to the exhaust and noise emissions from propulsion engines. To comply with the essential requirements, over 60 EN-ISO harmonised standards were developed, which provide guidelines to meet the essential requirements. Using the EN-ISO harmonised standards is voluntary and provides presumption of conformity with the Directive's requirements. However, manufacturers may choose alternative solutions to comply with the essential requirements. Harmonised standards for Directive 94/25/EC are developed at international level by the International Organization for Standardization in the ISO Technical Committee 188. Products which fulfill the Directive's essential requirements must bear the CE marking of conformity. The CE marking must appear in a visible, legible and indelible form on the product or, in the case of small components, its packaging. Where relevant, it should be accompanied by the identification number of the Notified body that carried out the conformity assessment procedures. In addition to the CE marking, the recreational craft must be accompanied by the following documentations and markings: the boat builder's plate; craft and engine identification number; owner's manual; and a written declaration of conformity. These items are necessary for the product to be considered as compliant with the requirements of the Directive. Notified bodies are appointed at the national level by EU Member States to carry out conformity assessments on boats and engines according to the requirements of the Directive. To assist in the uniform interpretation and application of the Directive, the Recreational Craft Sectoral Group was established in 1995. Initially, the Directive established four categories that permit the allowable wind and wave conditions for vessels in each class:\\"The Barge Buyer's Handbook\\" - DBA publications *Class A - the boat may safely navigate any waters. *Class B - the boat is limited to offshore navigation. (Winds up to Force 8 & waves up to 4 metres) *Class C - the boat is limited to inshore (coastal) navigation. (Winds up to Force 6 & waves up to 2 metres) *Class D - the boat is limited to rivers, canals and small lakes. (Winds up to Force 4 & waves up to 0.5 metres) However, since 18 January 2017, the latest version of the Recreational Craft Directive 2013/53/EU became applicable, changes are as follows: Design categories: the geographical description (ocean, coast,...) has been removed. Design category A: the term \\"largely self-sufficient\\" has been removed. the words: \\"excluding abnormal conditions, such as storm, violent storm, hurricane, tornado and extreme sea conditions or rogue waves\\" have been added. Craft Identification Number CIN (previously HIN) has been replaced by Watercraft Identification Number WIN, the Manufacturer Identification COde MIC must now be registered in a member state. Builder's plate In place of the manufacturer's name, the RCD II now requires manufacturer's name, registered trade name or registered trademark, as well as contact address (note a website is acceptable). The new directive now requires the means of reboarding to be: accessible to or deployable by a person in the water unaided. Sailing yachts now need to comply with visibility for helmsman requirements. Means of escape in the event of inversion is now only required for multihull susceptible to inversion. Toilets must now have a holding tank, toilets can not be discharged directly overboard but must pass through the holding tank Manufacturers need to ensure that the propulsion engines are now complying with RCD I http://www.ceinspector.com/history/ ReferencesExternal links *European Commission website on recreational craft *Recreational Craft Sectoral Group *European Boating Industry Recreational Craft Directive Compliance Guide * http://www.ceinspector.com/history/ Category:European Union directives Category:Boating ","title":"Recreational Craft Directive"},{"id":"38234601","text":"Linda Cheesman is an American former fitness and figure competitor and female bodybuilder.

The prefrontal cortex may be the neuroanatomical locus mediating the HTR. Many serotonergic hallucinogens, including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), induce the head-twitch response, and so the HTR is used as a behavioral model of hallucinogen effects. However while there is generally a good correlation between compounds that induce head twitch in mice and compounds that are hallucinogenic in humans, it is unclear whether the head twitch response is primarily caused by 5-HT2A receptors, 5-HT2C receptors or both, but recent evidence shows that the HTR is mediated by the 5-HT2A receptor and modulated by the 5-HT2C receptor. Also, the effect can be non-specific, with head twitch responses also produced by some drugs that do not act through 5-HT2 receptors, such as phencyclidine, yohimbine, atropine and cannabinoid receptor antagonists. As well, compounds such as 5-HTP, fenfluramine and 1-Methylpsilocin can also produce head twitch and do stimulate serotonin receptors, but are not hallucinogenic in humans. This means that while the head twitch response can be a useful indicator as to whether a compound is likely to display hallucinogenic activity in humans, the induction of a head twitch response does not necessarily mean that a compound will be hallucinogenic, and caution should be exercised when interpreting such results.

In order to simplify the structure, to any curve y=ax^2+bx+c the point (\\\\infty,a) is added. A further advantage of this completion is: The plane geometry of the completed parabolas/lines is isomorphic to the geometry of the plane sections of a cylinder (see below).  The classical real Laguerre plane  Originally the classical Laguerre plane was defined as the geometry of the oriented lines and circles in the real Euclidean plane (see ). Here we prefer the parabola model of the classical Laguerre plane. We define: \\\\mathcal P:=\\\\R^2\\\\cup (\\\\\\\\{\\\\infty\\\\\\\\}\\\\times\\\\R), \\\\ \\\\infty otin \\\\R, the set of points, \\\\mathcal Z:=\\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\{(x,y)\\\\in \\\\R^2 \\\\mid y=ax^2+bx+c\\\\\\\\}\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{(\\\\infty,a)\\\\\\\\} \\\\mid a,b,c \\\\in \\\\R\\\\\\\\} the set of cycles. The incidence structure (\\\\mathcal P,\\\\mathcal Z, \\\\in) is called classical Laguerre plane. The point set is \\\\R^2 plus a copy of \\\\R (see figure). Any parabola/line y=ax^2+bx+c gets the additional point (\\\\infty,a). Points with the same x-coordinate cannot be connected by curves y=ax^2+bx+c . Hence we define: Two points A,B are parallel (A\\\\parallel B) if A=B or there is no cycle containing A and B. For the description of the classical real Laguerre plane above two points (a_1,a_2), (b_1,b_2) are parallel if and only if a_1=b_1. \\\\parallel is an equivalence relation, similar to the parallelity of lines. The incidence structure (\\\\mathcal P,\\\\mathcal Z, \\\\in) has the following properties: Lemma: :* For any three points A,B,C, pairwise not parallel, there is exactly one cycle z containing A,B,C. :* For any point P and any cycle z there is exactly one point P'\\\\in z such that P\\\\parallel P'. :* For any cycle z, any point P\\\\in z and any point Q otin z that is not parallel to P there is exactly one cycle z' through P,Q with z\\\\cap z'=\\\\\\\\{P\\\\\\\\}, i.e. z and z' touch each other at P. Laguerre-plane: stereographic projection of the x-z-plane onto a cylinder Similar to the sphere model of the classical Moebius plane there is a cylinder model for the classical Laguerre plane: (\\\\mathcal P,\\\\mathcal Z, \\\\in) is isomorphic to the geometry of plane sections of a circular cylinder in \\\\R^3 . The following mapping \\\\Phi is a projection with center (0,1,0) that maps the x-z-plane onto the cylinder with the equation u^2+v^2-v=0, axis (0,\\\\tfrac{1}{2},..) and radius r=\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\ : :\\\\Phi: \\\\ (x,z) \\\\rightarrow (\\\\frac{x}{1+x^2},\\\\frac{x^2}{1+x^2},\\\\frac{z}{1+x^2})=(u,v,w)\\\\ . *The points (0,1,a) (line on the cylinder through the center) appear not as images. *\\\\Phi projects the parabola/line with equation z=ax^2+bx+c into the plane w-a=bu+(a-c)(v-1). So, the image of the parabola/line is the plane section of the cylinder with a non perpendicular plane and hence a circle/ellipse without point (0,1,a). The parabolas/line z=ax^2+a are mapped onto (horizontal) circles. *A line(a=0) is mapped onto a circle/Ellipse through center (0,1,0) and a parabola ( a e0) onto a circle/ellipse that do not contain (0,1,0). The axioms of a Laguerre plane The Lemma above gives rise to the following definition: Let \\\\mathcal L:=(\\\\mathcal P,\\\\mathcal Z, \\\\in) be an incidence structure with point set \\\\mathcal P and set of cycles \\\\mathcal Z. Two points A,B are parallel (A\\\\parallel B) if A=B or there is no cycle containing A and B. \\\\mathcal L is called Laguerre plane if the following axioms hold: Laguerre- plane: axioms :B1: For any three points A,B,C, pairwise not parallel, there is exactly one cycle z that contains A,B,C. :B2: For any point P and any cycle z there is exactly one point P'\\\\in z such that P\\\\parallel P'. :B3: For any cycle z, any point P\\\\in z and any point Q otin z that is not parallel to P there is exactly one cycle z' through P,Q with z\\\\cap z'=\\\\\\\\{P\\\\\\\\}, : i.e. z and z' touch each other at P. :B4: Any cycle contains at least three points, there is at least one cycle. There are at least four points not on a cycle. Four points A,B,C,D are concyclic if there is a cycle z with A,B,C,D \\\\in z. From the definition of relation \\\\parallel and axiom B2 we get Lemma: Relation \\\\parallel is an equivalence relation. Following the cylinder model of the classical Laguerre-plane we introduce the denotation: a) For P\\\\in \\\\mathcal P we set \\\\overline{P}:=\\\\\\\\{Q\\\\in \\\\mathcal P \\\\  \\\\ P\\\\parallel Q\\\\\\\\}. b) An equivalence class \\\\overline{P} is called generator. For the classical Laguerre plane a generator is a line parallel to the y-axis (plane model) or a line on the cylinder (space model). The connection to linear geometry is given by the following definition: For a Laguerre plane \\\\mathcal L:=(\\\\mathcal P,\\\\mathcal Z, \\\\in) we define the local structure : \\\\mathcal A _P:= (\\\\mathcal P\\\\setminus\\\\\\\\{\\\\overline{P}\\\\\\\\},\\\\\\\\{z\\\\setminus\\\\\\\\{\\\\overline{P}\\\\\\\\} \\\\  \\\\ P\\\\in z\\\\in\\\\mathcal Z\\\\\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{\\\\overline{Q} \\\\  \\\\ Q\\\\in \\\\mathcal P\\\\setminus\\\\\\\\{\\\\overline{P}\\\\\\\\}, \\\\in) and call it the residue at point P. In the plane model of the classical Laguerre plane \\\\mathcal A _\\\\infty is the real affine plane \\\\R^2. In general we get Theorem: Any residue of a Laguerre plane is an affine plane. And the equivalent definition of a Laguerre plane: Theorem: An incidence structure together with an equivalence relation \\\\parallel on \\\\mathcal P is a Laguerre plane if and only if for any point P the residue \\\\mathcal A _P is an affine plane. Finite Laguerre planes minimal model of a Laguerre plane (only 4 of 8 cycles are shown) The following incidence structure is a minimal model of a Laguerre plane: : \\\\mathcal P:=\\\\\\\\{A_1,A_2,B_1,B_2,C_1,C_2\\\\\\\\} \\\\ , : \\\\mathcal Z:=\\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\{A_i,B_j,C_k\\\\\\\\} \\\\  \\\\ i,j,k=1,2\\\\\\\\} \\\\ , : A_1\\\\parallel A_2,\\\\ B_1\\\\parallel B_2,\\\\ C_1\\\\parallel C_2 \\\\ . Hence \\\\mathcal P= 6 and \\\\mathcal Z=8 \\\\ . For finite Laguerre planes, i.e. \\\\mathcal P<\\\\infty, we get: Lemma: For any cycles z_1,z_2 and any generator \\\\overline{P} of a finite Laguerre plane \\\\mathcal L:=(\\\\mathcal P,\\\\mathcal Z, \\\\in) we have: : z_1=z_2=\\\\overline{P}+1. For a finite Laguerre plane \\\\mathcal L:=(\\\\mathcal P,\\\\mathcal Z, \\\\in) and a cycle z\\\\in \\\\mathcal Z the integer n:=z-1 is called order of \\\\mathcal L. From combinatorics we get Lemma: Let \\\\mathcal L:=(\\\\mathcal P,\\\\mathcal Z, \\\\in) be a Laguerre‚Äîplane of order n. Then :a) any residue \\\\mathcal A_P is an affine plane of order n \\\\quad, b) \\\\mathcal P=n^2+n, c) \\\\mathcal Z=n^3. Miquelian Laguerre planes Unlike Moebius planes the formal generalization of the classical model of a Laguerre plane, i.e. replacing \\\\R by an arbitrary field K, leads in any case to an example of a Laguerre plane. Theorem: For a field K and : \\\\mathcal P:=K^2 \\\\cup (\\\\\\\\{\\\\infty\\\\\\\\}\\\\times K), \\\\ \\\\infty otin K , : \\\\mathcal Z:=\\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\{(x,y)\\\\in K^2 \\\\  \\\\ y=ax^2+bx+c\\\\\\\\}\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{(\\\\infty,a)\\\\\\\\} \\\\  \\\\ a,b,c \\\\in K\\\\\\\\} the incidence structure :\\\\mathcal L(K):= (\\\\mathcal P,\\\\mathcal Z, \\\\in) is a Laguerre plane with the following parallel relation: (a_1,a_2) \\\\parallel (b_1,b_2) if and only if a_1=b_1. Similar to a M√∂bius plane the Laguerre version of the Theorem of Miquel holds: Theorem of Miquel (circles drawn instead of parabolas) Theorem of MIQUEL: For the Laguerre plane \\\\mathcal L(K) the following is true: :If for any 8 pairwise not parallel points P_1,\\\\ldots,P_8 that can be assigned to the vertices of a cube such that the points in 5 faces correspond to concyclical quadruples then the sixth quadruple of points is concyclical, too. (For a better overview in the figure there are circles drawn instead of parabolas) The importance of the Theorem of Miquel shows the following theorem, which is due to v. d. Waerden, Smid and Chen: Theorem: Only a Laguerre plane \\\\mathcal L(K) satisfies the theorem of Miquel. Because of the last Theorem \\\\mathcal L(K) is called a miquelian Laguerre plane. Remark: The minimal model of a Laguerre plane is miquelian. : It is isomorphic to the Laguerre plane \\\\mathcal L(K) with K = GF(2) (field \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}). Remark: A suitable stereographic projection shows: \\\\mathcal L(K) is isomorphic to the geometry of the plane sections on a quadric cylinder over field K . Ovoidal Laguerre planes  There are a lot of Laguerre planes that are not miquelian (see weblink below). The class that is most similar to miquelian Laguerre planes are the ovoidal Laguerre planes. An ovoidal Laguerre plane is the geometry of the plane sections of a cylinder that is constructed by using an oval instead of a non degenerate conic. An oval is a quadratic set and bears the same geometric properties as a non degenerate conic in a projective plane: 1) a line intersects an oval in zero, one, or two points and 2) at any point there is a unique tangent. A simple oval in the real plane can be constructed by glueing together two suitable halves of different ellipses, such that the result is not a conic. Even in the finite case there exist ovals (see quadratic set).

Biography Mizuno was the son of a samurai in the service of Akita Domain, and was born at the Akita Domain‚Äôs Edo residence in what is now the Asakusa area of Tokyo. He was a graduate of the law school of Tokyo Imperial University in 1892, where one of his classmates was future Prime Minister Wakatsuki Reijir≈ç. Hozumi Nobushige introduced Mizuno to Shibusawa Eiichi, who offered him a position at his bank: however, Mizuno accepted Ume Kenjir≈ç‚Äôs offer of an introduction to the Minister of Agriculture & Commerce and opted for a career as a government bureaucrat instead. In 1894, he changed to the Home Ministry, working initially for the Bureau of Mines, and subsequently serving in numerous other roles. He was one of the Japanese delegates to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works in Switzerland, which resulted in the promulgation of the initial version of the Copyright law of Japan in 1899. By the invitation of Hara Takashi, Mizuno joined the Rikken Seiy≈´kai and was appointed to the upper house of the Diet of Japan. Under the administration of Prime Minister Terauchi Masatake, he was appointed to the Cabinet as Home Minister for the first time. From 1919 to 1922, Mizuno served as Parliamentary Commissioner of the Governor-General of Korea, a post which was effectively the head of the civilian administration of Korea under Japanese rule. Mizuno was regarded as particularly suited for this role, as he was familiar with the security apparatus for monitoring Korean residents in Japan and had experience in the suppression of civil disturbance due to his term as Home Minister during the Rice Riots of 1918.Weiner. Race and Migration in Japan, page 85 During his tenure in Korea, he greatly expanded the telephone infrastructure of the country, which had economic as well as security benefits,Yang. Technology of Empire. Page 46 On December 25, 1920 Mizuno was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun. Mizuno returned to the Cabinet as Home Minister again under the Kat≈ç administration from 1922 to 1923, turning the post over to Got≈ç Shinpei the day after the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake. After the Great Kant≈ç earthquake, Mizuno is infamous for causing anti-Korean sentiments by falsely accusing Koreans the crimes they did not cause, such as poisoning the well. This caused an indiscriminate genocide of Koreans. Almost 6,000 Koreans were slaughtered by Japanese civil militias. The civil militias ruthlessly murdered Koreans or Chinese who were wearing Korean and Chinese traditional clothes. When they discovered Koreans or Chinese wearing Japanese clothes, the civil militias required them to pronounce \\"ÂçÅ‰∫îÂÜÜ‰∫îÂçÅÈä≠(Fifteen Yen Fifty Bucks, „Åò„ÇÖ„ÅÜ„Åî„Åà„Çì„Åî„Åò„Å£„Åõ„Çì),\\" which is especially hard for Koreans to pronounce. As a result many Koreans, plus Chinese, Ryukyuan people, Japanese people from Hokkaido or rural places, and many others who failed to pronounce them correctly were brutally slaughtered.:ko:Í∞ÑÌÜ† ÎåÄÏßÄÏßÑ Ï°∞ÏÑ†Ïù∏ ÌïôÏÇ¥ ÏÇ¨Í±¥ At the end of 1923, after the Toranomon Incident, he was requested to return to the Cabinet as Home Minister for a third time, under the Keigo administration. From 1927 to 1928, Mizuno served as Minister of Education. As Education Minister, he took steps to purge leftist professors from Japan's imperial universities and to ban radical leftist student groups.Marshall. Academic Freedom. Page 134 In 1928, Prime Minister Tanaka Giichi attempted to appoint his close friend Fusanosuke Kuhara, a businessman noted for his radical right-wing politics and first-year member of the Diet to the post of Home Minister. Mizuno resigned in protest, which should have brought down Tanaka‚Äôs Cabinet. However, Tanaka brought Mizuno a message from Emperor Hirohito asking Mizuno to withdraw his resignation. The incident caused an uproar in the House of Peers and threatened to precipitate a constitutional crisis, as this would mean that the Emperor was violating a long-standing rule of not interfering directly in politics and the action was perceived to be favorable to the Rikken Seiy≈´kai over their rivals, the Rikken Minseit≈ç. Mizuno was forced to resign once again, and Tanaka fell increasingly out of favor with the Emperor; the incident was a major force in driving Tanaka from office in 1929.Bix. Hirohito. Page 212 In his later years, Mizuno served as chairman of the Japanese Society for Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers, and other posts. On 17 April 1938, Mizuno was awarded the Order of the Paulownia Flowers. At the end of World War II he was arrested by the Allied occupation forces and held in Sugamo Prison for Class-A war criminal charges for his position as honorary vice-chairman of the Dai-Nippon Koa Domei (Japan Pan- Asian Alliance), a war-time nationalist society, but was released on 1 September 1947 without coming to trial.

The aircraft struck the ground in a sparsely populated area after a very steep and rapid descent, narrowly avoiding crashing into a highly populated area. The crew of three on board were killed in the accident; there were no passengers, nor were there injuries or property damage on the ground. Accident The 25-year-old aircraft, a Lockheed L-100-30 Hercules, registration 7T-VHG, was operating a cargo service between Algiers-Houari Boumediene Airport and Frankfurt Airport as Flight 2208; it was flying over Italian soil at when it began descending for unknown reasons. The pilot had informed that there was an engine loss of power prior to losing contact with the Milan air traffic control while the aircraft was flying at . The pilot was able to direct the aircraft's descent towards a sparsely populated area. It struck the ground between Milan and Parma in a village named Besurica, located in the outskirts of Piacenza. Upon impacting, the airframe broke in two. According to the Corriere della Sera, the impact was so devastating that the wreckage of the aircraft was strewn over several kilometres, while the loud noise of the crash was heard in the city proper. The impact created a crater long and wide. The upper portion of the rudder and parts of the elevator were found and ahead of the impact point, respectively. The aircraft narrowly avoided crashing into highly populated areas, to the extent that the mayor of Piacenza referred to the occurrence as a miracle. There were neither injuries nor property damage on the ground, but the crew of three on board lost their lives in the accident. Investigation The Agenzia Nazionale per la Sicurezza del Volo (ANSV) started an inquiry, following the recovery of the cockpit voice recorder a week after the crash. The flight data recorder was also recovered, and results from its decoded ribbon showed that the aircraft was flying at cruising altitude with the autopilot engaged, that it got disengaged twelve seconds after the autopilot failure light lit, and that both directional and longitudinal control was lost moments later, with the aircraft crashing 73 seconds after the light came on. The angle and the speed of the impact were estimated to be between 45¬∞ and 50¬∞ and in the range of , respectively. Aftermath Given that the aircraft flight data recorder (FDR) was a first generation one manufactured in the 1960s, it was not in compliance with ICAO regulations. The ANSV urged the Algerian Civil Aviation Authority to replace older FDRs with newest ones.

He was executed in May 1662 at Gwalior Fort on the orders of paternal uncle, Emperor Aurangzeb.  Early life  Shazada Muhammad Sulaiman Shikoh Bahadur was born on 15 March 1635 to Prince Dara Shikoh and his first wife Shazadi Nadira Banu Begum. His mother was a Mughal princess and daughter of Shazada Muhammad Parviz (son of Jahangir) and Shazadi Iffat Jahan Begum. He was also the first grandchild of the then 43 year-old emperor, Shah Jahan. His paternal aunts included Jahanara Begum, Roshanara Begum and Gauharara Begum. His paternal uncles were Shah Shuja, Murad Bakhsh and Aurangzeb. He was called \\"Potay Miya\\" by his grandfather Shah Jahan. Sulaiman Shikoh had was siblings was Two Brothers and Four Sisters among his closed was Only Javeda un nissa. In 1642, his father Dara Shikoh became the heir apparent to the Mughal Throne.  Refuge in Srinagar, Kingdom of Garhwal  Dara Shikoh (left) and Sulaiman Shikoh After the defeat of Dara Shikoh at the battle of Samugarh on 29 May 1658, his son Suleiman Shikoh took refuge in Garhwal in 1659 A.D. Aurangzeb had spared the daughters and minor sons of his brothers, but as Dara Shikoh's heir, Sulaiman Shikoh was a threat. According to Muntakhab-al Lubab, \\"Suleiman Shikoh had sought refuge with the zamindar of Srinagar\\". Travernier has also referred to Suleiman Shikoh's escape to Garhwal, but he has mixed the two incidents in one, i.e. of 'Nak-kati-Rani' and of Suleiman Shikoh's taking refuge in Garhwal. He has stated: In the footnote, the translator V. Ball has mentioned that, \\"Sreenagar is the original Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, and that the account is based upon hearsay\\". However, it is well known that Srinagar was the capital of the kingdom of Garhwal and it was founded by Raja Ajay Pal in 1358 A.D. In Tuzuk-i- Jahangiri, Srinagar has been referred to for the kingdom of Garhwal. Niccolao Manucci has also mentioned the name of Srinagar the capital, and the country of Srinagar, for the Garhwal kingdom. The translator's footnote that the incident is hearsay therefore cannot be accepted. According to Muntakhab- ul-Lubab, it is vividly evidenced that Suleiman Shikoh took refuge in Garhwal. The view is further supported by Fran√ßois Bernier, Manucci and Qanungo.  Aurangzeb's attempts to extricate Sulaiman from Garhwal  Aurangzeb tasked Sulaiman Shikoh's former ally Raja Jai Singh to capture the prince. Aurangzeb sent repeated messages through Raja Jai Singh to Prithvi Pat Shah, Raja of Garhwal, to surrender the prince but his persuasion and threats were met with contempt. In the book 'Bernier's Voyage to the East Indies‚Äô it is mentioned that: Manucci has also mentioned the defiant attitude of the Raja of Garhwal. The Raja wrote back to Raja Jai Singh that on no account he could harm his reputation by making over to Aurangzeb anyone who had sought his protection. He was however thankful for Raja Jai Singh's friendship, as for Aurangzeb he needed neither his promises nor his menaces. He further wrote that he might inform the Mughal that he had no respect for either his power or his victories and let him recall to mind the occasion when his father Shah Jahan sent an army to Garhwal and the survivors of that army had their noses chopped off. In the end he has commented, \\"let him know that he who could cut off noses could equally cut off heads.\\" Aurangzeb then took recourse to ruse. Dr. Qanungo is of the view that when Jai Singh could not convince the king of Garhwal to surrender Suleiman Shikoh, he instigated a powerful Brahmin minister against him who tried to give him poison in the form of medicine. But the vigilant prince tested the adulterated medicine on a cat and was saved. When the king came to know about his minister's treachery he got him beheaded. Later Jai Singh inspired the Garhwali prince Medni Shah to emulate Aurangzeb and revolt against his father.  Capture and aftermath  left According to the sources of local history, the tradition goes that when Prithvi Pat Shah sentenced his minister to death, the other ministers, officials and all the members of the family became hostile to him. Thereafter, his son Medni Shah, on the advice of his ministers, revolted against his father and tried to seize power. Concomitantly, on Aurangzeb's orders, in late 1660 Jai Singh sent his son Ram Singh to Srinagar, Garhwal, to persuade the authorities to hand over Suleiman Shikoh to him, bearing the Emperor's dire threats. However, when Ram Singh met Prithvi Pat Shah, he refused to comply and told him that he will protect the Mughal prince as long as he lived. Then Ram Singh and Medni Shah, who were friends, tried to hatch a conspiracy against Shikoh. But before they could take any action against him he came to know about their motive and slipped away in the night with the intention of escaping to Tibet. Unfortunately he lost his way in the hills and was betrayed by the villagers. They informed Medni Shah about his whereabouts who got him arrested and handed him over to Ram Singh. Shikoh was surrendered to Aurangzeb somewhere around December 1660 A.D. because according to Dr. Qanungo he was brought before Aurangzeb on 5 January 1661. Bernier has mentioned that, Bernier has not detailed the circumstances in which Shikoh was surrendered and from his account it appears that Prithvi Pat Shah had to surrender to circumstances. But during the surrender it seems he was away from Srinagar, the capital of Garhwal. Bernier in his description has referred to the \\"hostile preparations of the neighbouring Rajahs,\\" and Walton has mentioned that \\"during the reign of Pirthvi Shah the aggressions of the Kumaonis continued under the leadership of the then Raja Baz Bahadur who had already fought on the side of Khalel Ullah against the Garhwalis\\". It is possible that the neighbouring Raja of Kumaon must have launched an attack on the borders of Garhwal and during that period Prithvi Pat Shah had to move from Srinagar the capital to thwart the invasions of the Kumaonis. The penitence of Raja Prithvi Pat Shah about his son's treachery indicates his innocence as regards the surrender of Shikoh. Manucci has stated: Moreover, it seems that Medni Shah was banished from Garhwal owing to his misdeed of surrendering Shikoh. He had to leave Srinagar for Delhi on this issue where he died in 1662 A.D. His death in Delhi is corroborated by the ‚Äòfarman' which Aurangzeb sent to Prithvi Pat Shah in 1662 A.D. In the ‚Äòfarman' it is stated, This farman is preserved in the U.P. State Archives in Lucknow. On 5 January 1661, Shikoh was brought before Aurangzeb. Accounts say that Shikoh's entry into the court, in chains, made quite an impression. Many were moved to tears at the sight of the fallen prince. Apparently, even Aurangzeb softened and offered to spare Sulaiman. The prince stoically replied that if he was a lingering threat, he should be killed immediately; he also requested that he would not be left to rot in some prison. Perhaps miffed by the rebuff, Aurangzeb did not grant his wish.  Death  On Aurangzeb's orders, Shikoh was imprisoned into a dungeon in Gwalior Fort. An opium-based poison was administered everyday so that the prince would descend into madness and infirmity. Many months passed, but Shikoh somehow did not deteriorate. In May 1662, after nearly eighteen months of imprisonment, Aurangzeb resolved to end the threat forever and ordered his men to strangle the prince. Suleiman Shikoh was thus executed. He was buried in the Traitor's Cemetery in Gwalior, where his uncle Murad was also buried.  Personal life  right Sulaiman Shikoh was married several times.

The group was founded on August 29, 1936 with the endorsement of Norman Thomas, six-time presidential candidate of the Socialist Party of America. The WDL described itself as a \\"militant, politically nonpartisan organization which would devote itself exclusively to the protection of workers' rights\\". Its officers included Thomas, David Clendenin, George S. Counts, and Pauli Murray. Philosopher Richard Rorty's parents were active with the WDL when he was a child, and he acted as an errand boy for the group. Harry Fleischman acted as the group's chairman for twenty-five years. During World War II, the WDL supported war resisters, fought for desegregation of the armed forces, and opposed Japanese American internment. The group also took on the case of Odell Waller, a Virginia sharecropper sentenced to death in 1940 for killing his white landlord. Arguing that the landlord had cheated Waller and that he had in any case acted in self-defense, the WDL raised money for Waller's defense, lobbied for the commutation of his sentence, and mounted a nationwide publicity campaign on his behalf. The effort was unsuccessful, and Waller was executed on July 2, 1942. In the 1960s, the organization worked to integrate minorities and women into traditionally white male labor unions, though with little success. Archival collections The Workers' Defense League Records are housed at the Walter P. Reuther Library. The collection spans from 1936-1965 and consists of correspondence, news clippings, speeches, trial briefs and transcripts, press releases, and pamphlets and leaflets. The collection documents the Worker's Defense League's efforts to secure justice for labor organizers, victims of racial and economic discrimination, conscientious objectors, and government critics through established, legal processes.

Biography Mochizuki was born on ≈åsakikamijima, an island in the Seto Inland Sea, now part of Hiroshima Prefecture, where his father was an entrepreneur and ship owner. He went to Tokyo when he was age 13 and studied the English language, returning at age 17 to assist in the family business. However, he soon became interested in politics and was affiliated with the early Liberal Party of Japan. He was elected to the lower house of the Diet of Japan in the 1898 General Election, and was subsequently reelected from the same district 13 times. In his early career, Mochizuki spoke out strongly against factionalism in the Diet based on old clan-based affiliations. He later joined the Kenseit≈ç political party, but was recruited as one of the founding members of the Rikken Seiy≈´kai by It≈ç Hirobumi in 1900. He rose to a high rank within the party, eventually serving as secretary-general during the administration of Prime Minister Hara Kei. Mochizuki first joined the Cabinet under the Tanaka administration in 1927 as Minister of Communications. The following year, he was appointed Home Minister.Hunter, A Concise Dictionary of Modern Japanese History. Page 280 During his term as Home Minister, renewed activity by underground Japan Communist Party in 1928 led to the March 15 Incident, in which police arrested more than 1,600 Communists and suspected Communists under the provisions of the Public Safety Preservation Law of 1925. The same year, he pushed through an amendment to the law, raising the maximum penalty from ten years to death. Also while Home Minister in 1927, Mochizuki responded to a petition by pioneering Japanese feminist Shidzue Kat≈ç on women's suffrage by telling her to go home to wash her baby's diapers, as the place for women is in the home.Henderson, All Her Paths are Peace. Page 59 However, Mochizuki broke with the Seiy≈´kai in 1934, forming the short-lived Showa-kai party in 1935. He returned to the cabinet as Minister of Communications from 1935‚Äì1936, and served as a Cabinet councilor during the Yonai administration in 1940. Mochizuki died just before the start of the Pacific War. His birthplace in ≈åsakikamijima has been preserved as a museum. ≈åsakikamijima home page His grave is at the Tama Cemetery.

His self-exactness, lack of pretension and moral sense delayed the fame he deserved\\".Van Gindertael, Roger, ‚Äô‚ÄôFran√ßois Wendt n‚Äôest plus‚Äô‚Äô in: Les Lettres Fran√ßaises, n¬∞ 1336 , 27 May 1970. In collective exhibitions he was associated with the most famous painters of the New Ecole de Paris, particularly Roger Bissi√®re, Andr√© Lanskoy, Serge Poliakoff, Pierre Soulages, and Nicolas de Sta√´l. He is also associated with many better-known painters today.  Life  Willi Wendt was born on 16 November 1909 into a simple family living in Berlin, Germany. He was awarded a scholarship at the Berlin high school ‚ÄúZum Grauen Kloster‚Äù and carried on his secondary studies until obtaining his Abitur in 1928. From 1928 to 1934, he studied at university while pursuing art on the side. He sat philosophy (with Karl Jaspers and Martin Heidegger), English and German literature, and history of art at the Universities of Berlin, Heidelberg, and Freiburg-im-Breisgau. In a parallel direction he started drawing and painting. His first abstract attempts date back to 1931. For some time, he frequented painter Julius Bissier‚Äôs studio. His adhesion to the innovating ideas of abstract art found itself quite naturally associated to the perilous defence of democratic liberties, in particular to the artistic freedom increasingly curtailed by the rising Nazi regime. He was imprisoned by the Gestapo for proximity to Nazi opposition, then saw his friends either imprisoned or sent to the earliest concentration camps. For those reasons, he left the university at the doctorate level in 1934. In 1936 he was allowed to travel in Italy in order to improve his knowledge of archaeology. However, he also worked with painter Adolf Fleischmann, who was staying there, and Wendt ultimately chose to pursue painting. In 1937 his opposition to the Hitlerian regime forced him to go into exile. He left Germany for Paris, France, where he arrived in September with his friend, painter Greta Saur/Sauer. For a while he frequented Fernand L√©ger‚Äôs studio and was introduced to Wassily Kandinsky, Robert Delaunay, Otto Freundlich, and Serge Poliakoff. He took part in exhibition groups and, until the declaration of war, he also worked as a scenery painter, a language teacher, and a journalist. As Europe became embroiled in World War II, Wendt was in and out of incarceration. In 1938, he was interned as ‚Äúundesirable alien‚Äù at the La Sant√© Prison (Paris). After his release on poet Robert Desnos‚Äôs intervention and with additional support from artist Robert Delaunay, he was allowed to stay in Paris with the status of political refugee. From September 1939, he experienced a series of French internment/concentration camps for stateless persons, first at Orl√©ans and Cepoy (near Montargis), then at the Camp des Milles, and then N√Æmes. He escaped from the Nimes camp with some friends in the summer of 1940. He then took refuge in Marseille and went underground. Considered as a fugitive from Germany, he was again interned from October 1941 to March 1942 at the work camp of Aubagne, where he was incorporated as a ‚Äúprestataire‚Äù in the 829e GTRE until his dismissal as unfit for health reasons. When German control extended to the south of France at the end of 1942, Wendt took clandestine refuge at Grenoble in the spring of 1943. He was again incarcerated for four weeks in September 1943 in the disciplinary prison of Chapoly in Lyon. Recommended by active members of the French Resistance to Professor Robert Minder of Grenoble University and P. Andry-Farcy, head curator at the Museum of Grenoble, Wendt's protection was ensured when he obtained fake papers and an assistantship. He lived until the end of the war under the name of ‚ÄúFran√ßois Aymon‚Äù in Grenoble, in nearby La Tronche, and later at Monestier-de-Clermont. In the La Tronche villa of Brise des Neiges, he reunited with his friend Greta Saur/Sauer, who had found asylum there after her internment in the Gurs internment camp. He also met Charlotte Greiner, a refugee from Alsace. After the war ended in 1945, Wendt returned to Paris and married Greiner. Wendt continued his pictural research directed to the pre-war field of abstract art and joined the rapidly reconstituting artistic movement in Paris. He took part in the tradition of the Salon des Surind√©pendants and participated in the Salon des R√©alit√©s Nouvelles from its foundation in 1946. In the latter, he took an active hand in welcoming German painters who, after being stigmatized and even persecuted by the Nazi regime, had continued their creative activity.Zu Salm- Salm, Marie-Am√©lie, ‚ÄúEchanges artistiques franco-allemands et renaissance de la peinture abstraite dans les pays germaniques apr√®s 1945‚Äù (Edition L'Harmattan), 2004Schieder, Martin, ‚ÄúIm Blick des Anderen, die deutsch- franz√∂sischen Kunstbeziehungen 1945-1959‚Äù (Passages - Centre allemand d'histoire de l'art - Akademie Verlag), 2005 In 1949, he began a friendship with Roger Van Gindertael, co-founder and former editor of the review Cimaise, editor of the Parisian pages of Beaux Arts (Bruxelles), and art critic of the newspaper Combat. He remained in a precarious condition: limited by his status as a stateless person, having only temporary permissions of stay in France, and experiencing fluctuations in income and resources. His participation in group and personal group exhibitions finally brought him lightning ascension and the recognition of his peers. Painter Karskaya remembers: ‚Äú... he was the most authentic, the most true to himself among painters. He did not need to sign his pictures, having one of them before one‚Äôs to find them without looking for his signature, in those babylonian salons ...‚ÄùCatalog of the retrospective exhibition organised by Ch√¢tillon-des-Arts and the commune of Ch√¢tillon, p. 21. He relocated his residence to the Rue Gabriel P√©ri (G. P√©ri Street), now kept separate from his nearby studio on the Rue Hoche (Hoche Street), both in the Ch√¢tillon area of Paris. At these locations he would pursue the realization of his work. He remained strictly anonymous, with the admiration of some faithful friends and the lifelong support of his wife Charlotte. In 1968, he finally obtained French nationality. Since his arrival in France, thirty years before, he already belonged to it in his heart. He owned his naturalization to the intervention, support, and testimonies of Robert Minder, Professor at the College de France; Bernard Dorival, Head Curator at the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne; Roger Van Gindertael, art critic; and painters Olivier Debr√©, Roger Bissi√®re, and Pierre Soulages. Wendt suddenly died at his home, on 15 May 1970, at the age of 60. Art exhibitions=Group exhibitions= *1938: ‚ÄúPoint 38 by young ones‚Äù at the Galerie L‚ÄôEquipe (Paris, France), dir.: J.

But he did so reservedly: as he defied the systematisation of geometric abstraction, at times he also resisted being tempted by the subjectivity of lyrical abstraction. ‚ÄúFor fifteen years (1938‚Äì1953), I have been dependent on graphism. From the beginning, I have been seeking the objective. Through this quest, I have discovered structure.‚ÄùCatalog of the retrospective exhibition organised by Ch√¢tillon-des- Arts and the commune of Ch√¢tillon, p. 12. In this structure, Wendt could see the constituting elements of the pictural space, with tension and density as attributes. In a parallel direction, it had been clearly specified that the new research of the aesthetic activity liberated from the servitudes of figuration, required a deeper coincidence of the substance and form: ‚ÄúWe must reach a synthesis where neither colour nor form nor content is absent. Finally I say: content though the basis of the banal, the worldly and the magic vanished.‚Äù And he would ponder: ‚ÄúOr shall we be for ever looking for new recipes to divide up plans, break surfaces, or pile on the paint? I wonder. Or is it not rather a question of: If you want to be a painter, paint?‚ÄùLe Soleil Noir. Premier Bilan de l‚Äôart actuel 1937-1955, (1953), p.328 This last question implied an affirmative answer and a choice. From this very moment, Wendt recognized the primacy of the act of painting, the supremacy of the making over the concept for the accomplishment of being in situation in time and dependent on the constants of the human condition. This is the way we must understand the artist‚Äôs thought when jotting down these remarks: ‚Äúpainting is not an end in itself, but a means, like music and poetry; the choice of the pictural means is minor and depends on each one‚Äôs inclinations. It may be a matter of expressing, through suitable pictural means, not only our epoch in its most intimate structure, but also in what it overtops. Our blindness, our differences, our bondages infallibly express themselves in our painting. The forces which govern us, interior as well as exterior, may not always be definable. Without exception we are confined in life like all our fellowmen: this is our ivory tower and, perhaps, our only virtue.‚Äù Van Gindertael, Roger. ‚ÄúWendt‚Äù in Cimaise n¬∞5 (April 1954), p.16 And if he had been asked what principal efficiency factor appeared in the art of our time, he would have referred to the notion of intensity. His development really constantly strained towards a greater intensity; the exceptional capacity of animation which he then expresses fully marks his very direct and varied pictural writing. He sometimes reduced the modalities of this pictural writing to a tight texture and a measured structure in order to reconcile it with the spatial unit that seems to have been his ultimate objective.

The Italian writer and traveller, Niccolao Manucci, who worked under her father, described her as being beautiful and courageous. Family and early life Jahanzeb was the daughter of Crown Prince Dara Shikoh, the eldest son and heir-apparent of Emperor Shah Jahan. Her mother, Nadira Banu Begum, was a Mughal princess and was the daughter of Prince Muhammad Parviz, the second son of Emperor Jahangir and Shah Jahan's older half-brother. Dara Shikoh was favoured by Shah Jahan as well as his older sister, Princess Jahanara Begum, as Shah Jahan's successor. Jahanara had always been an ardent partisan of her younger brother and greatly supported him. Nadira Begum died in 1659 of dysentery and a few days after her death, Dara Shikoh was executed as per his younger brother, Aurangzeb's orders. After the death of Dara Shikoh, who was the heir-apparent to Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb became the sixth Mughal emperor. Jahanzeb subsequently became an orphan after the consecutive deaths of her parents. Her arrival before the throne of her father's murderer was vividly described by foreign chroniclers, as was her despair when she was handed over to her aunt, Princess Roshanara Begum, to take care of her, Roshanara immediately started mistreating Jahanzeb. She was therefore, forwarded to the Agra Fort by Aurangzeb where her grandfather, Shah Jahan, was being imprisoned. There, Jahanzeb was brought up by her eldest aunt, Jahanara Begum, as though she was her own daughter. Under her tutelage, Jahanzeb grew up to be a remarkably beautiful and cultured princess. When Jahanara died in 1681, she bequeathed her finest gems to Jahanzeb, her favourite niece. Marriage On 3 January 1669, Jahanzeb married her first cousin, Prince Muhammad Azam, the eldest son of her uncle Aurangzeb and his chief wife, Dilras Banu Begum. The marriage ceremony was arranged by Jahanara Begum, amidst the most lavish and grand celebrations and took place in her palace. Their marriage proved to be extremely happy. Jani was Azam's trusted companion and confidante as well as his favourite wife being greatly loved by him. She was also Aurangzeb's best-loved daughter-in- law. She gave birth to Azam's eldest son on 4 August 1670. He was named 'Bidar Bakht' by his grandfather. Aurangzeb, throughout his life showed marks of exceptional love to these two and to their eldest son, Prince Bidar Bakht, a gallant, discreet and ever successful general, on all three of whom he used to constantly lavish gifts. Bidar Bakht was his grandfather's favourite grandchild in his old age. After her marriage, Jahanzeb played multiple roles in her husband's household. Two of them in particular stand out. The first can be broadly defined as military in nature, the second, less dramatic, but just as critical. The princess maintained harmonious household relations by cultivating a strong spirit of camaraderie and shared struggle among key members of the princely household. Her skill at this came to the fore in the winter of 1702, when a spat between Azam and his chief huntsman and koka Mir Hedayatullah occurred as the men were on a hunt. Azam was furious and he immediately threw his koka out of his household. It fell to Jahanzeb to persuade her husband to forgive Mir Hedayatullah, which she was able to do. After a few days, Mir Hedayatullah joined Azam's household in his old position. The princess was also responsible for managing relations between Azam and their son, Prince Bidar Bakht. Unfortunately imperial favour poisoned relations between Bidar Bakht and his father. When Bidar was appointed viceroy of Malwa (contiguous to Gujarat where Azam was serving) in the early 1700s, Jahanzeb petitioned her uncle, Aurangzeb, to permit Bidar to come and visit her since she had not seen him in a long time. The young prince was granted seven days to visit his mother. =Military pursuits= Jahanzeb's first role in her husband's household can be broadly defined as a military one. In 1679, the princess led her husband's military contingents for more than three weeks when the prince was forced to move ahead on an urgent summons from his father, Aurangzeb. Three years later, in 1682, Jahanzeb mounted her own elephant to encourage a lagging Mughal counterattack on a Maratha Army. She is said to have personally handed out spears and paan and promised to commit suicide if the Mughal Army was overrun. She went into battle again in 1685-6 when Azam's forces had lost all hope during the invasion of Bijapur and is credited with whipping up morale. Death Jahanzeb's mausoleum, near Aurangabad in 1860s Jahanzeb died in 1705 of an abscess in the right breast. The French doctor Mons. Martin had proposed that the princess should be examined by one of his female relatives then living in Delhi, (evidently an Indo-Portuguese Christian woman) who was skilled in surgery (haziqa) so that he might prescribe medicines according to her report. But the princess refused to be examined by a woman who drank wine, lest her body should be defiled by her touch. The disease lingered on for two years and she eventually died in great pain. Upon her death, Azam was filled with great sorrow and despair which darkened the remainder of his life.

Tear tape is usually attached to the inner surface of packaging: paper, paperboard, corrugated fiberboard or plastic film. It is used on common non-durable fast-moving consumer goods such as soft drinks, groceries or toiletries, as well as tobacco products such as cigarettes and cigars, to aid the opening of the packaging. It is also used in courier envelopes and corrugated boxes. Tear tape serves as an easy opening device for the consumer, where it obviates the need for opening tools such as scissors or knives, or the use of excessive force. Tear tape provides a guide on the tear area, thereby allowing more precise opening which reduces product spillage. Tear tape is available in several constructions and has a variety of uses.

Market ideology  As a liberal and advocate of the free market De Grauwe has long time been a strong proponent of the market economy and globalisation. In De onvoltooide globalisering (The Uncompleted Globalisation), written for a broader audience, he explains why he favors globalisation and discusses the statements of anti-globalists, which he finds somewhat pessimistic. He sees himself as an optimist and believes that market forces and economic growth will offer a solution to the issues related to natural resources, energy, environment and climate. However, De Grauwe has recently pointed out the necessity of government in this market economy. He said he used to uphold financial markets as bearers of the truth but now acknowledges that it is a world where rationality is intertwined with emotions. In an interview, he stated that certain entities are needed to correct market forces. Because of the global financial crisis, the need to correct the market is greater today than before. For this reason his acknowledgement of a strong government has increased. 'Was ik 25, dan stond ik nu op Wall Street mee te betogen', Faculty of Economics - KU Leuven, Retrieved 15 January 2013.

Life  Hanlin was born in Armadale, West Lothian on 28 August 1907. At the age of 14 he left school and worked on a farm for a year, then got a job at a mine where he worked for the next twenty years. While working as a miner he began to study at a journalism school in Glasgow. After a workplace accident in 1945, he spent three months in the Royal Infirmary, and he began to write stories and sell them, thus realising his childhood dream. Hanlin died at home on 7 April 1953, after developing heart and breathing problems.  Writing  During his lifetime, Hanlin wrote over thirty short stories, several novels and essays, and eight radio plays, two of which were broadcast. Once in Every Lifetime, published in 1945, was his most popular novel, selling 250,000 copies in the United Kingdom in the first three weeks of publication. It also won the ¬£500 first prize in the Big Ben Books Competition, and was translated into more than a dozen languages. Once in Every Lifetime was serialised in Woman's Home Companion, and a radio version was later broadcast on BBC Radio. Norman Collins, writing in the Observer, wrote that \\"his novel is an idyll of young love that somehow became sour and unlovely amid the grim landscape of the pitheads. It is brief, moving in places, almost unbearably so, and often beautiful. In short Mr. Hanlin is a remarkable fellow.\\" John Steinbeck also spoke enthusiastically of the author, declaring the book \\"excellent.\\" In his writing Hanlin draws on the themes of love and religion, but always in the context of the gritty realism and poverty of life in a small mining town.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. History The Life-Saving Station at Eagle Harbor was constructed in the period 1910-1912 by the United States Life- Saving Service. The original station complex included the station building with a hip-roof watch tower at the corner and a two-bay boathouse that probably was located where the present structure is. Other buildings and structures have been added to the complex over the years. In 1915, the Life- Saving Service was combined with the United States Revenue Cutter Service to create the United States Coast Guard, and the name of the Eagle Harbor Life- Saving Station was changed to the Eagle Harbor Coast Guard Station. In 1938 the original boathouse was replaced with the current structure. The station remained in service until 1950. In 1954, the station was turned over to the General Services Administration as surplus. Several structures were moved across Eagle Harbor to the grounds of the Eagle Harbor Light. The 1938 boathouse is the only original structure remaining on site. The Eagle Harbor Coast Guard Station Boathouse is currently operated by the Keweenaw County Historical Society as the Eagle Harbor Life-Saving Station. Description The Eagle Harbor Coast Guard Station Boathouse is a rectangular, one-story structure on a poured concrete foundation measuring 58 feet by 44 feet. The building has a hip roof clad in what may be original cedar shingles, and walls covered with wide exposure wood weatherboard siding. The building has three boat bays facing what was once a nearby former boat slip. There is a chimney on one side and small gabled dormers with round-head double-hung colonial windows in the roof on all the other elevations. There are five roll-up panel doors, two on the north elevation and three on the south elevation, and double-hung six-over-six windows with wooden shutters. The interior of the building contains one large open space, with concrete flooring gently sloping toward one end. The Keweenaw County Historical Society has filled the interior with displays of Life-Saving Service and Coast Guard artifacts, including rescue boats and equipment of the types used at this station.

He was succeeded in the next Assembly by James Catton, a Whig. When on March 13, 1854, a public meeting was held in the English Settlement meetinghouse to discuss the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Tinker was appointed president of the meeting (John Hockings was one of the speakers).

The current parish priest is Rev. Fr. Eric de Guzman succeeding Rev. Fr. Greg Vega.\\"Parishes of the Archdiocese of San Fernando\\". CBCP Online. History Founded in 1614, Minalin parish started as a visita (sub-parish) of Macabebe, Pampanga. Fr. Miguel de Salda√±a was assigned in 1618 as its own parish priest. On October 31, 1624, the Minalin parish became an independent vicariate under its prior, Fr. Mart√≠n Vargas. Minalin was given the two visitas of Pangasinan and Tubungao (Sta. Maria) in 1633. The act was reconfirmed in 1639. The convent of Minalin was under the Augustinians as of May 5, 1670, was added to Bacolor on May 9, 1650, and to Betis on October 21, 1678.. Don Lorenzo Malaca was the first native secular assigned to Minalin in 1771, succeeded by Don Manuel Francisco Tubil. The original location of the church was in Barangay Santa Maria. However, lumber stocks for the church construction were carried by floods from Santa Maria to a hilly place called Burol, which eventually became the location of the present church. The legend of the town's name came from \\"minalis la ding dutung, minalis ya ing pisamban\\" (the lumber moved, and so must the church). Capitan Diego Tolentino wrote the location as ‚Äúminalis‚Äù, which evolved into \\"Minalin.\\" There are no records as to who built the church, although it has been attributed to the work of Augustinian Fr. Manuel Franco Tubil in 1764. One documented source cites the church‚Äôs completion by the Augustinians in 1834.Castro, Alex R. (2008-01-14). \\"67. Pampanga's Churches: Sta. Monica Chuch, Minalin\\".

Mayor Cristino Lagman on July 30, 1911, stated that the church was completed in 1764 under Bachiller Calixto Gregorio. Fr. Jos√© Segu√≠, the Archbishop of Manila, visited Pampanga in 1831 and met the secular parish priest of Minalin, Don Quint√≠n C√°ndido Par√≠on. Dr. Mauricio Miranda was the parish priest in 1834 when the great flood occurred devastating the town. Despite the church‚Äôs elevated location, the flood waters of 1834 reached its main altar. The Church was reconstructed at various stages: in 1854, 1877 (repaired by Fr. Isidro Bernardo), 1885 (by P. Galo de la Fuente) and in 1895 (by Vicente Ruiz). Fr. Jos√© Torres' petition to rebuild the church and parochial house, was granted about July 5, 1866. The last Augustinian friar was Fr. Faustino Diez and the church was turned over to Alcalde (Mayor) Pedro Diaz and to the first native priest P. Macario Panlilio. Another account states that the last Augustinian priest to serve Minalin was Fr. Jose Sales. In 1937, the Most Rev. Michael J. O'Doherty, Archbishop of Manila, approved the request of Rev. Fr. Prudencio David, parish priest of Minalin, for re-plastering of the walls and repainting of the church interiors. Parish priest Fr.

The Philippine National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) called for the conservation and protection of Spanish-era churches because of heritage and culture declaring them as National Cultural Treasures (NCT). Priority status was bestowed not just due to their historical value, but also based on the geographic representation of various regions across the nation. The Santa Monica Church was declared such by the National Museum of the Philippines on August 27, 2011. Ahead of the 400th founding anniversary of Minalin Parish (‚ÄúAldo ning Minalin‚Äù) in 2014, the National Museum of the Philippines per Director Jeremy Barns inscribed the Sta. Monica Church of Minalin as a National Cultural Treasure (NCT) for three reasons: First, its fa√ßade‚Äôs that resembles a giant ‚Äúretablo‚Äù and was influenced by Christian, Buddhist, Hinduist and animistic cultures; second, the four capilla posas (prayer nooks or corner chapels) that are still duly preserved or intact at the four corners of its front patio and can only be found at the Santa Monica Church; and lastly, the old painting of the Our Lady of Consolation giving the cords to Saint Monica and her son Saint Augustine in the main altar.Santa Monica Church now a national treasure The church was the second NCT in Pampanga, after the Betis Church (Saint James Parish Church) in Betis, Guagua, Pampanga. Archbishop Paciano Aniceto, D.D., and Minalin parish priest Fr. Greg Vega both celebrated the historic Mass with Interior and Local Government Secretary Jesse Robredo and Minalin Mayor Arturo ‚ÄúKatoy‚Äù Naguit as guests.  Description  The four-century old Minalin Parish in Barangay San Nicolas is one of the first 20 missions put up by the Augustinians when they came to the Philippines. The church's design includes motifs reflective of pre-Hispanic culture. The spires decorating the bell towers depict a Moorish architecture, hinting of the old Islamic faith of early Minale√±os. None of the other 20 mission churches have similar motifs. The incipient baroque is of moderate decorative traits. There are several examples of this style in the churches built in the 18th century or before, such as those of Betis, Lipa, San Vicente, Candon, Magsingal and Sarrat. The church and convent is probably a center of religious orders ‚Äì foremost Augustinians, Franciscans, Jesuits and Dominicans. They heavily influenced the life and culture of the natives as evidenced by the images of Saint Augustine, Saint Francis of Assisi, Saint Dominic and Saint Francis Xavier in the reredos according to Minalin Parish Priest, Fr. Vega.Lakbay Pinas The Santa Monica Church measures long, wide and high. Twin towers flank the fa√ßade of the church. It has a transept and some very beautiful reredos. The peeled palitada (outer layer) reveals the original red brick walls, giving the church its unique old-rose touches. The most notable and striking architectural feature of the church is its retablo-like fa√ßade, the lavishly floral decorations of the main entrance and the windows above it. The floral d√©cor is evocative of early folk altars. An array of coupled Corinthian columns artistically crowd the center of the facade and act as support for the triangular pediment that is topped by a roof lantern or cupola.Galendro, Pedro G. Angels in Stone: Architecture of Augustinian Churches in the Philippines. 1987. During the Spanish era, a lighted beacon was placed on top of the apex of the pediment to guide fishermen as they made their way from the river to the town. The structure is further complemented with a short row of balusters. The semi-circular niches hold painted stone statues of various Augustinian saints, designed to blend with the rose windows. There is a dramatic contrast between volumes and projecting fenestrations, rose windows and semi-circular statue niches. The vertical movement is accentuated by the twin hexagonal four-story bell towers flanking the facade. The painting of Our Lady of Consolation at the apex of the reredos. The two hexagonal towers are solidly built. The four bells dated between 1850 and 1877 are dedicated to Saint Augustine and Saint Monica. The church-convent complex is enclosed by a low stone atrium with four capillas posas, a rarity in the Philippines. The ballast of the Minalin Church depicts Kapampangan mythological figures. Seals above the three side entrances symbolize St. Augustine and his work The City of God. The right belfry contains one of the two centuries old bells remaining in Minalin and the two smaller rotary bells. = Minalin Mural (1619) = The 1619 mural detailing Minalin, Pampanga during that period. The upper floor of the church convent contains native drawings of mysterious origins. The ancient mural painting (1619) is a primitive-looking map with details of trees, ducks, crows, a boat, a hunter and a crocodile. The year 1619 was a founding date of the town of Minalin. Of the 20 original Augustinian missions, Minalin is the only one that bears corbels showing pre-Hispanic culture. The church has elaborately decorated classical-style stone corbels and beams in the convent and high up in the church's ceiling, with carvings depicting pre-Hispanic pagan deities like naga (serpent), dapu (crocodile), galura (eagle) and bulig (mudfish).\\"Pampanga Churches\\". It's More Fun in the Philippines. The trees, ducks, crows, a boat and a hunter are very much imposing. The \\"Minalin Mural\\" is wide and tall showing the flora and fauna of Minalin during the early 1600s. It is a tale of ‚Äúprehistoric landscape of riverine communities\\", marshes and swamps with birds, agricultural land with damulag (carabao) and a farmer at the background. The map depicts the town as the seat of the Kapampangan region, according to a will by Francisco Malang Balagtas or Pansomun.Flora, Ian Ocampo (2011-08-07). \\"Town church to be named National Cultural Treasure\\". Sun Star Pampanga. The ancient painting is made of argamasa ‚Äì a type of cement used during the period which is made of lime mortal, fine river sand, and egg whites. The mural bears the date \\"1619\\", and is believed to have been made within five years of that date. The Moorish architecture is evidenced by the motifs: carved ornamental heads of bulig (mudfish), naga (dragon) and dapu (crocodile) ‚Äì sacramental figures of the old Kapampangan religious belief system. Comparable to the Muslim Mindanao torogan, the spires of the bell towers depict a Moorish architecture, showing the Islamic faith of early Minale√±os. When the ceiling was renovated in 1939, the mural paintings on it were removed. Msgr. Pablo D√≠az did the restoration of the church in 1982 while Fr. Rolando L√≥pez renovated the convent in 1998. In November 2012, residents who evacuated to the convent because of floods destroyed the lower left portion of the ancient mural. Mayor Arturo Naguit restored and preserved the convent mural with the assistance of engineers from Map√∫a Institute of Technology.Orejas, Tonette (2011-08-09). \\"Reconstructing town‚Äôs past through old photos\\".

Retrieved on 2014-08-05. = Four capillas posas = Santo Nino, the 4th of the capillas posas The many side and back minor altars of Santa Monica Church characterize it as one of the best examples of Baroque architecture in the Philippines. The four capillas posas are concrete arched structures used as ‚Äúoratory stations‚Äù for the Blessed Sacrament during Christ the King, Corpus Christi and other events.Minalin Church up as cultural treasure The capilla posa distinguishes Santa Monica Church as the only church in the Philippine that has these features fully preserved today. During the Hispanization of Minalin, these altars were used by Filipinos (termed by the Spaniards as Indios) as the church interior was reserved for ‚Äúpeninsulares‚Äù (full-blooded Filipino- Spaniards). = Our Lady of Consolation painting = At the apex of the main altar is one of the churches highly valued possession, the old painting of Our Lady of Consolation. The devotion to Our Lady of Consolation began when St. Monica in a vision received a black leather belt from the Blessed Virgin, who assured the holy widow that she would take under her special protection all those who wore it in her honor. In return, Monica gave it to her son, Augustine, who later changed his ways and eventually became one of the saints in the Roman Catholic Church. The 18th-century painting of Our Lady of Consolation at the top level of the reredos of the main altar of Sta Monica Parish Church, depicts the Blessed Virgin Mary holding Jesus her child. She is wearing a cord which is a representation of a belt that she supposedly gave to St. Monica, mother of St. Augustine. According to Rev. Fr. Pedro Galende, director of the San Agustin Museum, the belt is a \\"symbol of chastity\\" that represents Mary's Immaculate Conception delivery of Jesus into the world. The feast of Our Lady of Consolation is celebrated every September 4. The Clausura Procession is held every last Saturday of the month after the mid-morning Mass. The image is passed on from one shoulder to another shoulder by devotees as the procession goes around the convent in the tradition of the early monastic period.Apung Monica =Pierced heart of Sta. Monica= Pierced heart of St. Monica (under the choir loft) On Aug 26, 2011, parish Priest Fr. Vega announced the discovery of the heart, an unusual bas relief or sculpture carved from an adobe beam supporting the choir loft at the church entry, being hidden for centuries inside the old wooden ceiling. Inverted and pierced with arrow, it is unlike other parts of the church, particularly above entry doors. Churches also had centuries-old bas reliefs all depicting emblems of St. Augustine (his book City of God, his miter, and a church). Her heart is supposed to symbolize sufferings because of Augustine's previous sinfulness. The church architecture evolved during the construction by Augustinian friars in the 1600s and completed in 1764, demonstrating a confluence of various cultural influences. Lotus flowers with Buddhist motif are carved in one door, while wooden trusses supporting the roof are shaped at the edge like a crocodile reflecting local pre-Hispanic folk beliefs.

Essentially an affirmative (positive) form is used to express the validity or truth of a basic assertion, while a negative form expresses its falsity. Examples are the sentences \\"Jane is here\\" and \\"Jane is not here\\"; the first is affirmative, while the second is negative. The grammatical category associated with affirmative and negative is called polarity. This means that a sentence, verb phrase, etc. may be said to have either affirmative or negative polarity (its polarity may be either affirmative or negative). Affirmative is typically the unmarked polarity, whereas a negative statement is marked in some way, whether by a negating word or particle such as English not, an affix such as Japanese -nai, or by other means, which reverses the meaning of the predicate. The process of converting affirmative to negative is called negation ‚Äì the grammatical rules for negation vary from language to language, and a given language may have more than one method of doing so. Affirmative and negative responses (especially, though not exclusively, to questions) are often expressed using particles or words such as yes and no, where yes is the affirmative and no the negative particle. Affirmative and negative responses Special affirmative and negative words (particles) are often found in responses to questions, and sometimes to other assertions by way of agreement or disagreement. In English, these are yes and no respectively, in French oui, si and non, in Swedish ja, jo and nej, and so on. Not all languages make such common use of particles of this type; in some (such as Welsh) it is more common to repeat the verb or another part of the predicate, with or without negation accordingly. Complications sometimes arise in the case of responses to negative statements or questions; in some cases the response that confirms a negative statement is the negative particle (as in English: \\"You're not going out? No.\\"), but in some languages this is reversed. Some languages have a distinct form to answer a negative question, such as French si and Swedish jo (these serve to contradict the negative statement suggested by the first speaker).  Grammatical rules for negation =Simple negation of verbs and clauses= Languages have a variety of grammatical rules for converting affirmative verb phrases or clauses into negative ones. In many languages, an affirmative is made negative by the addition of a particle, meaning \\"not\\". This may be added before the verb phrase, as with the Spanish no: * Est√° en casa. (\\"(S)he is at home\\", affirmative) * No est√° en casa. (\\"(S)he is not at home\\", negative) Other examples of negating particles preceding the verb phrase include Italian non, Russian –Ω–µ nye and Polish nie (they can also be found in constructed languages: ne in Esperanto and non in Interlingua). In some other languages the negating particle follows the verb or verb phrase, as in Dutch: *Ik zie hem. (\\"I see him\\", affirmative) *Ik zie hem niet. (\\"I do not see him\\", negative) Particles following the verb in this way include not in archaic and dialectal English (\\"you remember not\\"), nicht in German (ich schlafe nicht, \\"I am not sleeping\\"), and inte in Swedish (han hoppade inte, \\"he did not jump\\"). In French, particles are added both before the verb phrase (ne) and after the verb (pas): *Je sais (\\"I know\\", affirmative) *Je (ne) sais pas, J'sais pas, Chais pas (\\"I don't know\\", negative). However, in colloquial French the first particle is often omitted: Je sais pas. Similar use of two negating particles can also be found in Afrikaans: Hy kan nie Afrikaans praat nie (\\"He cannot speak Afrikaans\\"). In standard Modern English, negation is achieved by adding not after an auxiliary verb (which here means one of a special grammatical class of verbs that also includes forms of the copula be; see English auxiliaries). If no such verb is present then the dummy auxiliary do (does, did) is introduced ‚Äì see do-support. For example: *I have gone ‚Üí I have not gone (have is the auxiliary) *He goes ‚Üí He does not go (no auxiliary in the original sentence) Different rules apply in subjunctive, imperative and non- finite clauses. For more details see . (In Middle English, the particle not could follow any verb, e.g. \\"I see not the horse.\\") In some languages, like Welsh, verbs have special inflections to be used in negative clauses. (In some language families, this may lead to reference to a negative mood.) An example is Japanese, which conjugates verbs in the negative after adding the suffix -nai (indicating negation), e.g. taberu (\\"eat\\") and tabenai (\\"do not eat\\"). It could be argued that English has joined the ranks of these languages, since negation requires the use of an auxiliary verb and a distinct syntax in most cases; the form of the basic verb can change on negation, as in \\"he sings\\" vs. \\"he doesn't sing\\". Zwicky and Pullum have shown that n't is an inflectional suffix, not a clitic or a derivational suffix. Complex rules for negation also apply in Finnish; see . In some languages negation may also affect the dependents of the verb; for example in some Slavic languages, such as Polish, the case of a direct object often changes from accusative to genitive when the verb is negated. =Negation of other elements= Negation can be applied not just to whole verb phrases, clauses or sentences, but also to specific elements (such as adjectives and noun phrases) within sentences.The linguist D. Biber refers to two types of negation, synthetic ('no', 'neither' or 'nor' negation) and analytic ('not' negation). For example, \\"He is neither here nor there\\" (synthetic) or \\"He is not here\\" (analytic). This contrast is usually labeled sentential negation versus constituent negation. Ways in which this constituent negation is realized depends on the grammar of the language in question. English generally places not before the negated element, as in \\"I witnessed not a debate, but a war.\\" There are also negating affixes, such as the English prefixes non-, un-, in-, etc. Such elements are called privatives. =Multiple negation= There also exist elements which carry a specialized negative meaning, including pronouns such as nobody, none and nothing, determiners such as no (as in \\"no apples\\"), and adverbs such as never, no longer and nowhere. Although such elements themselves have negative force, in some languages a clause in which they appear is additionally marked for ordinary negation. For example, in Russian, \\"I see nobody\\" is expressed as —è –Ω–∏–∫–æ–≥–æÃÅ –Ω–µ –≤–∏ÃÅ–∂—É ja nikov√≥ nye v√≠zhu, literally \\"I nobody not see\\" ‚Äì the ordinary negating particle –Ω–µ nye (\\"not\\") is used in addition to the negative pronoun –Ω–∏–∫–æ–≥–æÃÅ nikov√≥ (\\"nobody\\"). Italian behaves in a similar way: Non ti vede nessuno, \\"nobody can see you\\", although Nessuno ti vede is also a possible clause with exactly the same meaning. In Russian, all of the elements (\\"not\\", \\"never\\", \\"nobody\\", \\"nowhere\\") would appear together in the sentence in their negative form. In Italian, a clause works much as in Russian, but non does not have to be there, and can be there only before the verb if it precedes all other negative elements: Tu non porti mai nessuno da nessuna parte. \\"Nobody ever brings you anything here\\", however, could be translated Nessuno qui ti porta mai niente or Qui non ti porta mai niente nessuno. In French, where simple negation is performed using ne ... pas (see above), specialized negatives appear in combination with the first particle (ne), but pas is omitted: *Je ne bois jamais (\\"I never drink\\") *Je ne vois personne (\\"I see nobody\\") *Je n'ai jamais vu personne (\\"I have never seen anybody\\") In Ancient Greek, a simple negative (Œø·Ωê ou \\"not\\" or ŒºŒÆ m·∏ó \\"not (modal)\\") following another simple or compound negative (e.g. Œø·ΩêŒ¥ŒµŒØœÇ oude√≠s \\"nobody\\") results in an affirmation, whereas a compound negative following a simple or compound negative strengthens the negation: * Œø·ΩêŒ¥Œµ·Ω∂œÇ Œø·ΩêŒ∫ ·ºîœÄŒ±œÉœáŒ≠ œÑŒπ oude√¨s ouk √©paskh√© ti, \\"nobody was not suffering something\\", i.e. \\"everybody was suffering\\" * Œº·Ω¥ Œ∏ŒøœÅœÖŒ≤ŒÆœÉ·øÉ ŒºŒ∑Œ¥ŒµŒØœÇ m·∏ï thorub·∏ósƒìi mƒìde√≠s, \\"let (not) nobody raise an uproar\\", meaning \\"let nobody raise an uproar\\" Meaning of negation Simple grammatical negation of a clause in principle has the effect of converting a proposition to its logical negation ‚Äì replacing an assertion that something is the case by an assertion that it is not the case. In some cases, however, particularly when a particular modality is expressed, the semantic effect of negation may be somewhat different. For example, in English, the meaning of \\"you must not go\\" is not in fact the exact negation of that of \\"you must go\\" ‚Äì this would be expressed as \\"you don't have to go\\" or \\"you needn't go\\". The negation \\"must not\\" has a stronger meaning (the effect is to apply the logical negation to the following infinitive rather than to the full clause with must). For more details and other similar cases, see the relevant sections of English modal verbs. Negation flips downward entailing and upward entailing statements within the scope of the negation. For example, changing \\"one could have seen anything\\" to \\"no one could have seen anything\\" changes the meaning of the last word from \\"anything\\" to \\"nothing\\". In some cases, by way of irony, an affirmative statement may be intended to have the meaning of the corresponding negative, or vice versa. For examples see antiphrasis and sarcasm. For the use of double negations or similar as understatements (\\"not unappealing\\", \\"not bad\\", etc.) see litotes.

It stars Kurt Russell, Jay Baruchel, Chris Diamantopoulos, Matt Dillon, and Katheryn Winnick. It was shown at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot Crunch Calhoun begins with a soliloquy as he starts a seven-year sentence in a Polish prison, courtesy of his brother, Nicky Calhoun. A flashback reveals the heist involving the two men that went wrong; resulting in Nicky's capture and subsequent betrayal of Crunch. Once released, Crunch works as a motorcycle daredevil alongside girlfriend Lola and an apprentice, Francie. Meanwhile, Nicky steals a painting by Georges Seurat with the help of a partner whom he double crosses. The partner seeks out and threatens Crunch to get information on Nicky's whereabouts. Shortly afterwards, Crunch informs an old colleague of his, 'Uncle' Paddy, that he's ready to work again. At Paddy's place, he and Francie run into Nicky. 'Uncle' Paddy explains that a priceless historical book needs to be stolen from a Customs warehouse in Canada and taken to the buyer's middle man in Detroit. The payout is over a million dollars so they agree. Crunch insists on recruiting an old partner, Guy de Cornet, for his skills and talent in forgery. Cornet creates an exact replica of the book which Crunch takes through the Canadian border station hidden inside a peculiar piece of art. An identity check prompts the police to impound his art, as planned, in the same facility where the historical book is being held. Meanwhile, Guy de Cornet passes as an art authentication expert and enters the facility, replacing the real book with the forgery and hiding the real book within Crunch's art piece. After Canadian border patrol clears Crunch's name, he goes to the facility and reclaims his art piece. The team is in the process of taking the book to the buyer when Nicky persuades Crunch to keep the book and forge multiple duplicates to sell to multiple buyers at the same time, netting them several times the original payout. They run into a snag when Cornet reveals that in order for him to create forgeries that would pass such tests as carbon dating and professional scrutiny, they would need $750,000. Each person names an amount they could chip in and after some persuasion, Crunch agrees to fund the remaining amount. They agree not to contact one another until the required month has passed to conduct the transaction. Sometime during this month, Nicky secretly plots to create his own cheaper forgeries and beat his team at selling them to the same buyers. Nicky calls the original buyer and informs him that there will be a delay, but the buyer claims to know nothing about the deal. A frantic Nicky calls all people and organizations involved in the heist, learning to his dismay that they either could not be reached or had no knowledge of the book. Meanwhile, Crunch explains to his apprentice Francie how the historical book was a fabricated ploy and its true purpose was to steal the Georges Seurat painting from Nicky and make a great deal of money using Nicky's idea of multiple forgeries. Flashbacks reveal that Francie was the only one who did not know of the alternate plan. Meanwhile, Interpol receive an anonymous tip as to the whereabouts of Nicky and the painting that he stole from the partner that he double crossed earlier. The ending reveals the last player in Crunch's plan, an old reformed colleague of his by the name of Samuel Winters, who had been paired with the Interpol agent who had been watching them at the start of the plan.

Twelve days after the Polonnaruwa meteorite was \\"seen falling\\" to Earth, Chandra Wickramasinghe published in the online fringe science Journal of Cosmology that, after studying some electron micrographs, his team discovered fossilized diatoms (microscopic phytoplankton) inside the meteorite as well as cells similar to those found in the Red rain in Kerala that fell in 2001. In addition, his team of scientists reported in a separate article that they are certain that it is a meteorite that originated from a comet and that it also contained living diatoms. The rock is not deemed by peer scientists to be a meteorite, so it was not recorded in the international Meteoritical Society database. Criticism Wickramasinghe claimed that these microorganisms constitute strong evidence for panspermia, On 15 January 2013 a diatom expert, Patrick Kociolek, verified that the forms pointed out in the paper are indeed diatoms. Then he added: Meanwhile, PZ Myers, who studies evolutionary developmental biology, questions \\"why a space organism would evolve to look exactly like a species that evolved in a completely different environment, and how it could have converged in all its details on such remarkable similarity to a specific Earthly species? Why, we might even suggest that it clearly looks like contamination.\\" While ignoring the environmental influence in evolution, a proponent of the panspermia hypothesis, Brig Klyce, contends that since life on Earth and life from space are closely related, resemblance would be expected. Wickramasinghe's research paper was not peer reviewed by experts prior to publication, and early on, there were claims that Wickramasinghe's article was not an examination of a meteorite but of some terrestrial rock. Scientists from the Peradeniya University Geology Division, and the Department of Forensic Medicine, as well as the Arthur C. Clarke Institute for Modern Technologies in Sri Lanka examined fragments of the alleged meteorite, and concluded that it is a terrestrial rock formed by lightning strikes (fulgurite). The silica and quartz bulk content confirms the terrestrial fulgurite explanation, and further discards the meteorite hypothesis, as any silica in a meteorite would be present in trace amounts.Meteorite or meteowrong?. Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Washington University in St. Louis. Quote: \\"If you can see quartz with the naked eye, then the rock is not a meteorite.\\" Another proposed explanation holds that the alleged meteorite did arrive from space, but is associated with the billions of tonnes of terrestrial material that asteroid impact events have previously blasted into space during the Earth's geological history.

The independent shaft and housing allow for continuous rotation of either component. This is an example of a two passage rotary union with independent channels that allow both liquids and gases to transfer simultaneously. A rotary union is a union that allows for rotation of the united parts. It is thus a device that provides a seal between a stationary supply passage (such as pipe or tubing) and a rotating part (such as a drum, cylinder, or spindle) to permit the flow of a fluid into and/or out of the rotating part. Fluids typically used with rotary joints and rotating unions include various heat transfer media and fluid power media such as steam, water, thermal oil, hydraulic fluid, and coolants., Kadant Inc., retrieved 10/13/2017. A rotary union is sometimes referred to as a rotating union, rotary valve, swivel union, rotorseal,http://www.eaton.com/Eaton/ProductsServices/ProductsbyName/Airflex/Rotorseals/index.htmrotary couplings, rotary joint, rotating joints, hydraulic coupling, pneumatic rotary union, through bore rotary union, air rotary union, electrical rotary union, or vacuum rotary union, Rotary Systems Inc., retrieved 1/22/2013.  Function  A rotary union will lock onto an input valve while rotating to meet an outlet. During this time the liquid and/or gas will flow into the rotary union from its source and will be held within the device during its movement. This liquid and/or gas will leave the union when the valve openings meet during rotation, and more liquid and/or gas will flow into the union again for the next rotation. Often functioning under high pressure and constant movement, a rotary union is designed to rotate around an axis. A rotary union's design can be altered to change this or to increase the psi or rpm it needs to withstand as well as the number of valves required.  Composition  While rotary unions come in many shapes, sizes, and configurations, they always have the same four basic components: a housing unit, a shaft, a bearing (mechanical) (or bearings), and a seal. Rotary unions typically are constructed from stainless steel to resist rust and corrosion, but many other metals can be involved, like aluminum. =Housing= The housing is the component that holds all of the other elements of the rotary union together. The housing has an inlet port, which is a threaded port to which the hose supplying the medium will be attached. The rotary union may also have an outlet port, if the same joint is being used both to supply fluid to a roll and to remove fluid from the roll. In smaller rotary unions the housing is stationary. In larger rotary unions the housing is usually bolted to the drum or roll using a flange. In these cases the housing rotates at the same speed as the drum =Shaft= The shaft is the component that carries the medium through the rotary union into the drum or roll. In many cases the shaft will turn with the drum or roll. In some cases, like in larger flanged rotary unions, the shaft may be stationary while the housing rotates. The bearings and seal are typically assembled around the shaft. =Bearing= The second most important part of the rotary union is the bearing. A rotary union may have only one bearing, but multiple bearing are much more common. Roller bearings; such as ball bearings and tapered roller bearings; or non-roller bearings, like graphite bearings and bronze bushings, may be used in a rotary union. The bearings are always used to allow a part of the joint, either the shaft or the housing, to rotate =Mechanical seal= The heart of the rotary union is the seal. The seal prevents the medium from leaking outside the rotary union while in operation. Seal types can vary from pusher-type end face mechanical seal, non-pusher type end face mechanical seal, lip seals, and o-ring seals. Most rotary unions have more than one seal., Duff Norton, retrieved 1/15/2013.  Types of rotary unions  Many rotary unions incorporate multiple ports, some of which are designed to handle different types of material simultaneously. A rotary union with a straight port transfers the substance directly through the rotary union. Other designs include an elbow port, which causes the material to flow out at an angle, and multiple ports. A multiple port rotary union looks like a perforated cylinder. At the end of the cylinder is a threaded screw with a seal or seals that lock on to it. The material being transferred flows into the cylinder and out of the input holes. In the case of a rotary union with multiple inputs, chambers separated by seals keep the materials from inadvertently mixing. This type of rotary union is often used in the manufacture of plastics and other petroleum products, for which multiple inputs may need to be streamlined, but kept separate.  Uses  Many assembly lines incorporate multiple rotary unions, because they are highly versatile and take up less space than other devices designed for a similar purpose. Rotary unions also appear in automobiles and other machines that require constant supplies of lubrication, air, or other liquids in order for moving parts to run smoothly. Brakes, for example, use rotary unions to maintain a constant supply of pressurized brake fluid. Rotary unions are also heavily used in crude oil processing, the chemical industry, commercial food production, and pharmaceutical applications. =Agriculture= Equipment used in grain harvesting including combines, tractors, grain carts and threshers employ rotary unions. Once harvested, many crops will be processed with equipment that uses rotary unions. Food processing equipment that use rotary unions include cooling conveyors, flaking mills, shredders, steam cookers, starch dryers, rotary cutters and roll-forming. =Automotive= Auto manufacturing is a diverse user of rotary unions for a broad range of parts or components and materials, whether machined steel, iron or aluminum, stampings, plastics, glass or paperboard. Rotary unions are used for operations that require coolant, lubricant or hydraulics. =Car washes= There are two kinds of car wash facilities that use unions: the automatic and the hand operated. Most manufacturers of automatic systems have several revolving brushes which use 55 series to introduce low pressure detergent water through the supporting shaft to the brushes. In addition, automatic car washes have spinners that require rotary unions to transmit high-pressure water into the spinning mechanisms. =Converting= Downstream processing of paper, plastic film, foil and related substrate materials into finished, printed packaging such as bags, pouches, labels, tags, folding cartons and corrugated shipping cases is called converting. Rotary unions are used in all types of converting for water, steam, thermal oil, air or hydraulics. =Machine tools= Rotary unions may be used to transmit coolant, cutting oil, MQL, pressurized air in a bearingless or bearing supported configuration. Besides coolant delivery, rotary unions are used for chucking, tool sensing, rotary index table and other machine tool applications. =Mining= Electro-hydraulic equipment used in mining operations employ rotary unions including shuttle cars and coal cars, drill heads, backhoes, clam shell cranes and drag lines. In addition, boom hoists, retrieving drums and bucket drum clutches each require rotary unions. =Oil and gas= Drilling rigs (oil or gas) use air clutches and brakes that require rotary unions. Water unions are used to flush mud from the drill tip, and must withstand shock and vibration in this severe application. Oil and petrochemical refineries use batch mixers, flaking mills, blenders and drying rolls that each require rotary unions. =Paper= Paper applications span the supply chain from the raw pulp and paper mills, to the downstream paper converters. Mills use steam joint and siphon systems and water unions for heating and cooling. Converters use rotary unions for heating and cooling rolls, as well as winders with air clutches and brakes. =Plastics= The manufacturing of plastic materials encompasses a wide variety of applications including cast film, blown film, foam, flexible and rigid sheet extrusion, single and multi-layer co-extrusion, blow molding, thermoforming, pelletizing, wire and cable, injection molding and winding. Rotary unions are used for heating or cooling the many processing rolls throughout the wide variety of applications. In addition, rotary unions for air and hydraulic service are used in winding and injection molding applications. Many of today's modern winding applications will also utilize electrical slip rings. =Printing= Printing on flexible rolls of paper or plastic films requires rotary unions for air or hydraulics, as well as chill rolls for temperature control. Web offset and sheet printing equipment use many rotary unions on the ink vibrator and chill rolls. =Rubber= Rubber is compounded on big industrial mixers which use rotary unions for water cooled rolls. Rubber extrusion is similar to plastic extrusion, with rotary unions used to cool the extruder screw. =Steel= The steel industry is one of the largest users of rotary unions primarily for continuous casting machines (CCM) which use rotary unions to cool the numerous rolls that support molten slabs as it moves by gravity through various segments onto a run-out table to downstream annealing and heat treating. The slab is formed into coil or sheet. Coil is further converted in processing centers that require hydraulic unions for actuation of mandrels. =Textiles= The textile industry is a large user of water, steam and hot oil unions. Weaving, dyeing and finishing processes are the largest users of rotary unions. =Tires= Rubber tire plants use industrial mixers, extruders, calendar train cooling stacks and rayon slashers to make tire cord. Rotary unions are used in every process for temperature control.

Navelcar is based in Pomburpa village. Navelcar, now in his 80s, began his art career in Mozambique, after training in Portugal, where he also lived for some time. He excels in Christian figurative art. He adopted the name of \\"Ganesh\\", after an incident that caused him to be \\"reborn\\" (Lord Ganesh is associated with new beginnings) and in memory of his brother Ganesh. Navelcar has been called \\"a state treasure of Goa, whose remarkable oeuvre spans several decades.\\" He has twice received the Gulbenkian Foundation Fellowships (1963 and 1971) and he won an international award at the International Exhibition of Art in Monte Carlo for his ink drawing, Angoch Woman. He is considered a \\"prolific master of line\\" with a specialisation in murals and bas-relief composed of metallic, wooden and glass structures and his works form part of private and museum collections worldwide. Life and career=Early life (1930 ‚Äì 1954)= Navelcar was born on 5 May 1930 in the village of Pomburpa, Bardez, Goa. He grew up by drawing and hiding his work from his family, who disapproved of it. Navelcar joined Bombay University in 1950 and was admitted to the Wardha University to study Hindustani (Hindi) and Urdu. He gained his SSCE and SSC in 1954 and decided not to continue to study medicine as he wanted to pursue arts by then. Returning to Goa, he secured a job with the Chowgule Company as an accountant and continued to produce his art work in his spare time, which was noticed and admired by his colleagues. After being asked by Mr Chowgule, the owner of the company, to do some portraits of dignitaries of the time, including Paulo B√©nard Guedes, who was the Governor-General of Portuguese India in 1953, his work was noticed. Guedes asked him to draw a portrait of Dr Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar, the then Prime Minister of Portugal, and subsequently awarded him a scholarship to study art in Portugal. =Portugal (1954 ‚Äì 1963)= In 1954 Vamona Navelcar set off to Portugal to study, but before he could apply to the Escola de Belas Artes, he first had to study Portuguese as well as other subjects at a secondary level to bring him to the level required for acceptance. The courses and subjects set for him would normally have taken 4 years to complete, but he did them in one year, a phenomenal achievement indeed. In 1955, at the age of 25 he applied to the Escola Superior de Belas Artes and was accepted without reservation. His studies went well but he faced many difficulties, particularly in the early days with the written and spoken Portuguese language. His relationship with his teachers and their assistants was also not good as they seemed to resent his talent and knowledge, though the professors and directors of the institution liked and admired his work. In December 1961, Goa was annexed by India. The political changes at that time caused great difficulty for Navelcar as he lost his grant to study just six months before he was due to graduate because he would not sign a document denouncing Nehru's Liberation of Goa. However, with the help of one of his professors he was given a grant by the Gulbenkian Foundation in 1963, which allowed him to complete his studies. In 1962 he graduated from the Escola Superior de Belas Artes with a thesis painting titled A Rotina and a year later completed his postgraduate painting titled, Ramayana. This was an oil interpretation of the Ramayana, which featured Rama and Hanuman on either side of Sita. After graduation, Navelcar tried to get a teaching position in Portugal but everywhere he applied he was rejected. =Mozambique (1963 ‚Äì 1976)= Navelcar soon became desperate and applied to the overseas department and managed to secure a position in Mozambique. In 1963 he set off to Africa, believing he had a position at the technical college in Mozambique's capital Lourenco Marques (now named Maputo). However, on his arrival, the overseas director, Dr Oliveira Bol√©o told Navelcar that he would be posted to the technical school in Quelimane. So, this is where he started teaching as a professor of geometry and mathematics in Lyceums, first in Quelimane for one year and then onto Nampula, being in Mozambique for thirteen years in total. However, at every step of the way he followed his passion for the arts, teaching those students who were interested in art the different techniques and processes, as well as expanding his own talent, evolving as an artist of the world and one to be reckoned with. Navelcar had a good life there, having a manservant named Sheriff who he trusted and became extremely fond of as a person. Once again Navelcar taught geometry as a main subject and art as a secondary subject. He was loved by all the students for his gentle and kind manner as well as his talent in teaching. However, when he asked his director for a room for a studio that he could use, he was told there was none spare. Some weeks later Navelcar asked to use one of the toilets that was not used and on this occasion, having no excuses he could think of, the director agreed. This studio was one of the places that Navelcar loved to be to do his creative work in peace and quiet. He describes how Francis Baker, too, would display his work in a toilet. During this period, he produced many paintings, drawings and murals, including the Angoch Woman (fisher woman). Time went by with many rewards and achievements in his art, expanding his talent and trying out new techniques including collages, ceramics, sculptures in metal, wood and other materials. He made many murals and large paintings as well as portraits of dignitaries throughout his time in Africa. He supported the local African people and became very fond of their company and their talents as well as all his students at college, never displaying any discrimination. Imprisonment (1975 ‚Äì 1976) As Mozambique fought for its independence through the FRELIMO (Front for the Liberation of Mozambique) movement, Navelcar supported the freedom fighters of Mozambique, often doing murals or helping his students to prepare posters, but never doing it openly or signing his work for fear of being punished by the Portuguese authorities. Navelcar supported freedom of the people to rule themselves, with no external interference from other countries as well as freedom of speech in which ever medium one chooses. On 25 April 1974 there was a military coup in Portugal called the Carnation Revolution, coupled with much civil unrest which toppled the dictatorial Estado Nova regime. Consequently, by 25 June 1975, the FRELIMO took over governance of Mozambique. Navelcar celebrated with the African communities. At the end of the term the students held a party to celebrate. However, this displeased the new strict communist FRELIMO regime, who arrested all those who attended the party (including Navelcar) on 3 November 1975. They were taken to Imala, a prison camp in the forest some 90 kilometres from Nampula. They were all held here for eighty one days until they were released on 23 January 1976 after the intervention of Armando Panguene, the newly appointed Provincial Governor in Nampula. During their stay in the prison camp they were subjected to hard labour, digging in the fields and in the cashew plantations, collecting the cashew nuts and apples. Many a time Navelcar refused to go to the fields and devised ways of helping his students by suggesting that they paint and make murals on the walls to revere and help the FRELIMO movement. The commander of the camp agreed in most cases to Navelcar's requests, so in that manner he was able to help his students, particularly the girls, to avoid the hard physical work in the fields. This helped keep up the spirits of both him and his students. Navelcar and his students were released in January 1976 with a convoy of police and parents arriving to bring them all safely back to Nampula. =Return to Portugal (1976 ‚Äì 1982)= During his imprisonment, Navelcar had contracted a severe ear infection, so on his return, he immediately sought medical help. By then most of the Portuguese had left Mozambique so it was difficult to find a qualified doctor. However, there was a Polish doctor still at the government hospital who told him that he should return to Portugal as soon as possible as there were no suitable medicines in the country. Immediately Navelcar made plans to return to Portugal, destroying all his teaching material and books. He packed two suit cases, one with clothes and the other with his work, trophies and certificates. Within eight days he was ready to leave and set off to Portugal, assisted by his trusted servant Sheriff, who was also distraught at Navelcar's decision to leave Africa. The flight took a long time as the route was tortuous, needing to stop only at places where it was safe to do so. On arrival in Portugal one bag was missing, the one with all his important documents and art work in it. Desperate to find it he tried all manner of contacts but all failed to find the missing case. Distraught by this event, Navelcar sat down and did a drawing signing it \\"Ganesh,\\" vowing at that time never to sign, ‚ÄúVamona Navelcar‚Äù again. (Further, this indicated his rebirth, and was a tribute to his elder brother Ganesh, who mentored Vamona but died at the age of 15 when Vamona was 6 years old.) Navelcar managed to secure a pension from the Government of 60% of his last salary form Mozambique, but with escalating prices and turmoil, times were very hard indeed. Eventually, after seven years back in Portugal with no prospect of work or people having spare money for the luxuries of purchasing paintings, Navelcar decided to return to Goa. Quickly forming a plan to leave Portugal, telling no one, even his closest friends until the last moment, he packed his few possessions and his work, booked the flights and asked his dear friend Dr Alexandre Ribeirinho to take him to the airport. So, on 6 October 1982, Vamona Navelcar set off back to his homeland of Goa. =Return to Goa (1976 ‚Äì Present)= Navelcar returned to Goa to feel \\"lost and ignored\\" by the public and even by his own family. He claims to have returned to try to find peace of mind and tranquility for his soul but adds that he has found none. His work is mostly abstract, and he was influenced heavily by European artists. He also admires the work of Goan artists like F. N. Souza and Vasudeo S. Gaitonde. In 2017, Casa de Goa, a centre for cultural activities which has promoted ties between Goa and Portugal for about 30 years, celebrated their 50th anniversary. As part of the celebrations, the Prime Minister of Portugal, Ant√≥nio Costa was presented with a portrait of Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, painted by Navelcar. Costa's father, Orlando da Costa, had once visited Navelcar's Pomburpa home and Navelcar had drawn a portrait of him. Artistry Inaugurating an art event in Goa. Describing his work in 2012, The Times of India commented: \\"The ethic extends to the great Vamona Navelcar. Known for his elegant line, for epitomizing gentility, the seniormost contributor has rendered a grotesque skull-bedecked Ogre, a painting that immediately recalls Angelo da Fonseca's Apocalypse (a likewise searing vision painted after a lifetime of making serene images).\\" The local newspaper The Navhind Times described him thus: \\"Vamona Ananta Sinai Navelcar alias Ganesh is a state treasure, whose remarkable journey spans over decades. He has won an international award for his ink drawing Angoch Woman at the International Exhibition of Art in Monte Carlo and has also been a recipient of the Gulbenkian fellowship twice. A prolific master of line, Vamona has specialised in murals and bas-relief composed of metallic, wooden and glass structures.\\"http://www.navhindtimes.in/iexplore/intimate-expression Dr Carmo Gracias from Margao, who owns more than 20 of Navelcar's paintings along with dozens of others by other Goan and Indian artists, describes how Navelcar can quickly create a rendition of Jesus Christ. He claims that Navelcar is exquisite in his style of line drawing, in which he draws an image in a single continuous stroke while not lifting his pencil or pen. Goan artist Bina Nayak has been quoted as having said that Navelcar is \\"the M.F. Hussain of Goa,\\" liking him to the famed Indian artist. Exhibitions Navelcar's first exhibition was in the early 1960s at the Palacio Foz in Lisbon. As part of Semana da Cultura (a celebration of Indo-Portuguese cultural fusion) in 2011, Navelcar's work was displayed at the Sunaparanta, Goa Centre for the Arts in an exhibition titled \\"In dreams the work is born\\". The exhibition ran from 22 to 31 October 2011. From 23 June to 9 September 2012, Navelcar exhibited his work at the Figueiro de Vinhos gallery, in the centre of Portugal. A Retrospective exhibition was held in Portugal from June to October 2012 curated by Vamona's long standing friend and admirer, Professor Antonino Martins Mendes. On 1 May 2017, an exhibition celebrating his life and work called \\"The Great Goan Art Festival\\" was organized by Marius Fernandes at Campal in Panaji. His works were displayed from 12 December 2017 to 12 January 2018 at the Fundacao Oriente, Panjim, in an exhibition titled Goa/Portugal/Mozambique: The Many Lives of Vamona Navelcar, featuring 16 of his works. The exhibition is co-hosted by the Al-Zulaij Collective, and an accompanying book was released, with the same title as the exhibition. Biographical works As of January 2013, retired aeronautical engineer and UK expat Anne Ketteringham has completed her book in conjunction with VS Arts, to be published on the life and work of Vamona Navelcar. The book is called Vamona Navelcar, An Artist of Three Continents and will be launched in Goa at Gallery Gitanjali, Panaji on 12 April 2013 with an exhibition of Vamona Navelcar's works over the decades. The book is now available at Village Sanctuary, Panaji, India. Navelcar is the subject of a 2019 documentary on his life titled I am nothing with Ronak Kamat directing it and sound editing by Ashley Fernandes. See also * Laxman Pai * F. N. Souza * Vasudeo S.

Waller unsuccessfully maintained at his trial that the killing had been in self-defense, but was convicted by a jury of white citizens who had paid the poll tax, a measure that effectively barred blacks and poor whites from jury service. The Workers' Defense League, a socialist labor rights organization, began a national campaign calling for the commutation of Waller's sentence, and was supported in its efforts by novelist Pearl S. Buck, philosopher John Dewey, and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. President Franklin D. Roosevelt also made a private appeal on Waller's behalf to Virginia Governor Colgate Darden. Though the campaign won several postponements of the sentence, Waller was finally executed on July 2, 1942. The case failed to overturn the poll tax, but led to reform of Virginia's penal system and motivated Pauli Murray to begin her career in civil rights law.  Killing of Oscar Davis = Background = Odell Waller was born in 1917 to Dollie Jones and an unknown father, who died shortly after his birth. Jones gave the boy to her sister Annie Waller and Annie's husband, Willis Waller, to adopt, and Odell considered Annie his mother. Odell completed three years of high school, but was later forced to leave school to work on the farm. From 1935 to 1938, he was convicted of seven offenses, including assault, reckless driving, bootlegging, and carrying a concealed razor. In January 1939, he married a woman named Mollie. During the Great Depression, the Wallers fell behind on the mortgage for their farm, and after Willis died in 1938, the bank foreclosed. Annie and Odell then agreed to become sharecroppers for a white landlord, Oscar Davis. The relationship quickly soured. Davis was also a sharecropper, and when his own landlord reduced Davis' land allotment, Davis reduced that of the Wallers to only . The Wallers accused Davis of failing to pay Annie an agreed $7.50 for taking care of Davis' ill wife for three weeks; when the Wallers subsequently refused to work in Davis' fields, Davis evicted them. Following the eviction, someone on the Davis farm mutilated one of the Wallers' dogs. After Annie's cousin Robert helped her harvest the farm's wheat, Davis took the whole crop rather than give the Wallers their share. In April 1940, Odell had taken a job constructing electrical lines in Maryland, but he returned on the weekend of July 13-14 to investigate the worsening situation. = The shooting = At 6:30 AM on July 15, 1940, Odell drove to Davis's farm to get the wheat with Annie, relatives Archie Waller and Thomas Younger, and a friend named Buck Fitzgerald. He brought a .32 caliber pistol. The subsequent events remain in dispute. Henry Davis, a teenage black employee of Oscar Davis, maintained that Odell Waller had fired at Oscar Davis without provocation or warning, hitting him four times. Oscar Davis's sons testified that their father had stated before he died that Waller had shot him without cause. One son added that Davis had said Waller had continued to shoot after Davis had already fallen to the ground. The testimony of other witnesses, including Waller's relatives, was inconclusive, as they were too distant to hear the conversation between Waller and Davis. Waller stated that Davis had refused to let him take the Waller family share of the wheat, and had reached for his pocket as if to draw a gun; Waller then fired on Davis. Davis escaped through the cornfield after being shot and was taken to the hospital, where he died of his wounds on July 17. Afraid he would be lynched, Waller fled to Columbus, Ohio, but was arrested there at the home of an uncle on July 24 after a manhunt involving police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Trial  During Waller's trial, which began on September 19, 1940, he was represented by Thomas H. Stone of the small communist splinter organization Revolutionary Workers League (RWL). The RWL's members had been expelled from the Communist Party USA in 1934 for their Trotskyist beliefs, and the organization was unpopular due to its opposition to World War II. The group compared the trial to that of the Scottsboro Boys, nine African-American young men accused of rape in Alabama under suspicious circumstances, and began to criticize the racism and economic conditions of Waller's rural Virginia county. Historian Richard B. Sherman argues that the group brought negative publicity to Waller's trial from the start by creating the perception that \\"radical outsiders\\" were behind his defense. A socialist labor rights organization, the Workers' Defense League (WDL), offered to take over the defense and public campaign to avoid the stigma of communism from influencing Waller's case, but the RWL rebuffed them. Stone and another defense attorney, J. Byron Hopkins, were given only three days to prepare Waller's defense. After an all-white jury was selected, composed only of citizens that could pay the poll tax, Stone moved that the case be dismissed on the grounds that Waller was \\"deprived of a trial by a jury of his peers\\". However, Stone failed to submit evidence that this was the case, a factor that would prove crucial in later unsuccessful appeals. The judge dismissed the motion, as well as a tactically questionable motion by Stone that the judge himself was prejudiced in the case and should withdraw. The testimony of Henry Davis and Oscar Davis's sons proved damning, and several witnesses also testified that they had heard Waller declare he would come home with his wheat or kill Oscar Davis. In an analysis of the transcript, Sherman proposes that the phrasing of these witnesses was so similar that they may have been coached by prosecutors, but the defense counsel did not pursue this possibility. On September 27, 1940, after less than an hour's deliberation, the jury found Waller guilty of first degree murder and sentenced him to death, a verdict praised by the Virginia press covering the trial. His execution was scheduled for December 27 of that year.  Campaign for commutation  After the trial, the RWL agreed to pass responsibility for the public campaign and legal appeals to the WDL, provided that the case continue to be handled \\"on a class struggle basis\\", with attention to national issues as well as Waller's specific situation. Eager to help Waller, the WDL reluctantly agreed to the terms. The organization assumed control of the case in November 1940 and immediately began fundraising on Waller's behalf. Pauli Murray, a young woman new to the organization, was dispatched on a national fundraising tour, accompanied at times by Annie Waller. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) joined the case the same month, as did the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, giving the case national publicity. Attorney Martin A. Martin (President of the Danville NAACP) developed information that both the grand jury that indicted Waller and petit jury that convicted him were composed only of white men who paid polled taxes (thus excluding most blacks and Waller's peers), although the county clerk initially gave him the runaround. The groups hoped that the case would lead the US Supreme Court to rule that the poll tax was unconstitutional. In December, Virginia Governor James H. Price granted Waller his first stay of execution, this one for three months, giving the new defense additional time to study the case. On March 28, 1941, philosopher John Dewey joined the cause, sending Murray $5.00 for Waller's defense and giving permission to use his name in further fundraising. Dewey later co-signed an open letter comparing Waller to Dred Scott, a slave who had unsuccessfully sued for his freedom before the US Supreme Court. One of Dewey's letters to the New York Times about the case caught the attention of Nobel Prize for Literature laureate Pearl S. Buck, who also became involved in the case. She wrote in an open letter of her own that Waller \\"has ceased to be an individual, he has become a personification of all those to whom democracy is denied in our country\\". US First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt also worked on Waller's behalf. Historian Richard B. Sherman states that she became involved after receiving a letter from Murray, which prompted her to write Governor Price requesting that he investigate whether Waller had received a fair trial and delay the execution. Roosevelt biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin, in contrast, holds that the First Lady intervened after receiving a handwritten note from Waller himself saying \\"I have heard lots of people speak of what a nice lady you are and what I can hear is that you believe in helping the poor ... Please write to the Governor and get him to have mercy on me and allow me a chance.\\" Whatever its beginnings, Roosevelt's involvement in the case caused her to be widely criticized in the white Southern press.  Execution  Coverage of Waller's execution in the Baltimore Afro American On June 1, 1942, the US Supreme Court denied two of Waller's petitions for appeal, and the defense was soon left without further legal options. In a final attempt to win a pardon or commutation from the governor, activists staged events around the country, including a two-hour blackout of the lights in the primarily African- American neighborhood of Harlem in New York City. Governor Price's successor, Colgate Darden, received over seventeen thousand letters about the case. On the eve of Waller's execution, Eleanor Roosevelt appealed to her husband, President Franklin D. Roosevelt; Franklin agreed, sending a private letter to Darden urging that the sentence be commuted to life imprisonment, signing it, \\"an old friend who just happens to be president\\". Darden held a ten-hour clemency hearing and, after hearing arguments from both sides, decided to proceed with the execution. Pauli Murray, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters' A. Philip Randolph, and the NAACP's Walter White traveled to Washington in an attempt to lobby the president personally, unaware that he had already secretly appealed on their behalf. The president's apparent refusal to act damaged his relationship with civil rights leaders; Murray, in an open letter on behalf of the movement, called it a \\"stab in the back\\". Murray and Eleanor Roosevelt, however, would remain friends until the latter's death two decades later. Waller wrote a ten-page \\"Dying Statement\\" before his execution, admitting he had made mistakes but insisting that he had acted in self-defense: > . He was executed by electric chair on the morning of July 2, 1942. At the time of his execution, Waller had been on death row for 630 days, then the longest death row stay in the state's history. His funeral was held on July 5 and was attended by 2,500 people. Only one white person, WDL Secretary Morris Milgram, attended. Other whites had been asked not to come; a reporter wrote of the exclusion that \\"[the black community] did not want 'Odell Waller's murderers' to look on his face in death\\".  Impact of the case  Pauli Murray was inspired by the Waller case to become a civil rights lawyer. Despite the uproar over the poll tax as a factor in jury selection, the tax remained in Virginia until the ratification of the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution outlawed it in 1964. Pauli Murray was deeply affected by her experience working on the case and was inspired to pursue her career in civil rights law. Governor Darden, influenced by the popular sentiment that the case had evoked, began a reform of the Virginia penal system, including the creation of an official Pardon and Parole Board with the authority to commute sentences.

Early life Sutherland was named after Fergus Bowes-Lyon, a brother of the Queen Mother who was killed during the Battle of Loos; Bowes-Lyon had been a friend of Sutherland's father Arthur. Although Sutherland was born in London he spent most of his childhood in Scotland near the town of Peebles. He spent his summers at the Somerset seaside village of Porlock where prominent trainer Dick Hern taught him how to ride. Military career He received his education at Eton and Sandhurst. He attained the rank of captain and was posted to the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards. During service with the regiment in the Korean War he lost his left leg in an explosion. Sutherland later recounted the event: \\"Going up a hill, one of the four troops I was with tripped the wire of a landmine and set off the blast. I was the only one badly injured\\". A soldier who was with him declared 'You're OK, Mr Fergie, it's only the leg'. \\"I knew that because I had already checked\\". After a period of convalescence Sutherland was posted to Egypt. He refused to allow his disability to affect his quality of life and commissioned artificial legs for specific activities ‚Äì for instance, he had different legs for horse riding, shooting and dancing. Horse training In 1957 he began his horse training career at Carlburg Stables in Newmarket as assistant to Geoffrey Brooke. In addition, he worked for Joe Lawson. Following Lawson's retirement, Sutherland's father purchased the Newmarket yard. During his initial season he enjoyed a considerable degree of success, his first winner coming when Tribune won at Wolverhampton in April 1958 and saddling a winner at Royal Ascot when A.20 won the Queen Mary Stakes 1958. She was ridden by Bill Rickaby, owned by H. Clifton, and started at odds of 5/1. In 1967 Sutherland moved to Co Cork in Ireland, when he heard his mother was contemplating selling Aghinagh House in Killinardrish. He transformed the dairy and pig farm into one of the country‚Äôs most successful small racing stables. =Imperial Call= After an impressive start to the 1996 racing season, Imperial Call ridden by Wexford born Jockey Conor O'Dwyer, beat Master Oats by six lengths to win the Hennessy at Leopardstown. Later that year he captured the Gold Cup at Cheltenham. He was Sutherland's first runner at the festival and became the first Irish-trained horse since Dawn Run ten years previously to capture the \\"blue riband event\\". He retired in 1996 but briefly resumed training for two years in 2000. Sutherland was awarded Irish Horse Racing Personality of the Year in 1996. During his retirement he enjoyed shooting and occasionally fishing. Personal life In April 1954 Sutherland married Judy Ranger in London. The reception was held in The Savoy. The couple had four children. After a brief second marriage he married for a third time to Ann. The marriage produced one daughter. Death He died on 31 October 2012 at the Marymount Hospice in Co.

Headed by chef Illario Mosconi, formerly from Lombardy, Italy, it is one of the Relais & Ch√¢teaux series of hotels and gourmet restaurants from around the world. The menu is an eight- course set menu of pasta dishes prepared with most of the ingredients imported from Italy. Mosconi became the first Italian restaurant to receive a Michelin star in Benelux. For a time, it had two Michelin stars but reverted to just one again in the guide for 2014. Background Born in Ponte di Legno near Brescia, and now in his mid-50s, Mosconi moved to Luxembourg with his parents when he was 13. His first experience in the restaurant business was as a waiter in Esch-sur-Alzette. When he opened his first restaurant, the Domus, also in Esch, he and his wife Simonetta worked in the dining room, not in the kitchen. But when almost 30, he realized his ambition of creating dishes of his own. He decided to take courses and work as a trainee with Gualtiero Marchesi at the Via Bonvesin de la Riva restaurant in Milan. There, he learned the art of cooking and the importance of selecting the very best produce available, leading him to import 90 per cent of his ingredients from Italy. This led to a Michelin star for the Domus in 1997, then to a first star at Mosconi in 2000, followed by a second in 2005.Lucy Gordan, \\"Ilario Mosconi\\", Epicurian Traveler.

Mapcarta. Map depicts al- Masmiyah and nearby localities. History=Roman and Byzantine era= Al- Masmiyah is identified with the Roman-era town of Phaena. Phaena was the capital of the Trachonitis district of Roman Syria, as confirmed by a Greek inscription on the Roman temple which reads \\"Julius Saturninus to the people of Phaena, capital of Trachon.\\"Porter, 1858, p. 503. The ruins of a Roman era house built in the Batanean architectural style is believed to have possibly served as the home of the Roman governor of Trachonitis.Freshfield, 1869, p. 57 One of the rooms on the ground-level floor was supported by an 18-foot arch and had a cornice-decorated ceiling. The town contains the ruins of a Roman- era pagan temple, called the Praetorium,Ball, 2002, pp. 242-243 that was constructed by the commander of the Third Gallic Legion between 160‚Äì169 CE during the reign of the Roman emperors Aurelius Antoninus and Lucius Aurelius Verus. In the early 3rd century CE, Phaena was still an important village known as a metrocomia.Donahue, 1988, p. 172. The Praetorium was transformed into a church during the Byzantine era and the structural plan makes it one of the oldest examples of Byzantine church architecture. The ancient city of Phaena had a radius of roughly three miles, making it as large as the ancient walled area of Damascus and larger than the Old City of Jerusalem. During the Byzantine era it became an episcopal see. =Ottoman era= In 1810, Swiss explorer Johann Burckhardt was the first contemporary scholar to visit al- Masmiyah and he was later followed by Bankes and Barry, who sketched a precise plan of the Praetorium, in 1819. In 1838, Biblical scholar Eli Smith reported that Kurds inhabited the village.Smith; in Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Second appendix, B, p. 155 By the late 1860s a few impoverished Arab families from the Sulut tribe reportedly lived inside the ruins of al- Masmiyah.Freshfield, 1869, p. 59 Apparently, the village was abandoned most of the time, but was occasionally occupied by nomadic Arab families seeking shelter in its ruins. In the 1870s, al-Masmiyah was an uninhabited village.Socin, 1876, p. 422 However, it was later settled when the Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid II (1876‚Äì1909) acquired al-Masmiyah and six other nearby Hauran villages in the late 19th century as a personal estate. The farmers he employed in the village were afforded security, giving them protection from nomadic raiders. They were also exempt from conscription, protected from monetary collections from local notables and at times were loaned money without interest. These factors resulted in the prosperity of al-Masmiyah and the larger estate. In 1875, before Abdul Hamid's reign, the Ottoman army took apart the Praetorium for the construction material used to build a nearby army barracks at Burraq. The temple had earlier been photographed by Tancr√®de Dumas. It still remained the subject of study by scholars in Greco-Roman architecture after its dismantlement.Kaizer, 2008, p. 110 In 1886, al-Masmiyah was briefly occupied by the Druze clans of Atrash and Halabi during a quarrel with the Sulut tribe.Firro, 1992, pp. 216-217. Following the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, the sultan ceded estate to the treasury department of the Damascus government and consequently, the inhabitants, who were both tenants of the government and permanent residents of the villages, had to pay 20‚Äì22% of their agricultural products to the authorities. Nonetheless, the conditions of the inhabitants of the government estate were better than the estates of the notables.Issawi, 1988, p. 330. In 1915 the population of al-Masmiyah was estimated as 300 Melkites (Greek Catholics) and 20 Sunni Muslims. Archaeological remains According to Western traveler Josias Leslie Porter who visited the region in the late 1850s, the ruins of al-Masmiyah \\"are among the interesting and beautiful in the Hauran.\\"Porter, 1858, p. 502. The majority of the village's ancient homes were in rubble, but a number of public buildings were relatively well-preserved. Porter further remarked that except for the Roman temple \\"there are several other buildings ... but they are not remarkable either for their size or architecture. =Roman temple= Along with the Roman temple dedicated to Tyche in nearby al-Sanamayn, the Praetorium of al-Masmiyah is the only Roman temple in the Levant that contains niches for statues in the cella. This unique feature in Roman architecture was likely inspired by pre-Roman architecture, particularly the temple of Baal-Shamin in the Syrian Desert town of Palmyra or in various Arabian cities.Kaizer, 2008, p. 107 The Praetorium was situated atop a podium in a temenos surrounded by colonnades. It was relatively small, measuring 24.8 x 16.4 meters. It has a rectangular ground plan with a semi-circular apse that projects onto one side of the building opposite of the doorway. Both sides of the doorway contained niches reserved for statues. The interior space consisted of a single room, which was the naos, and measured 15.09 x 13.78 meters.Kaizer, 2008, p. 111 The Praetorium was formerly topped by a square domed roof, likely a cloister vault, which had since collapsed.Sturgis, 1907, p. 292Freshfield, 1869, p. 56 The roof is supported by four free-standing columns fixed at the inner angles of cross-vaulted arches,Van Millingen, 2010, p. 2 which together form a Greek cross.Longfellow, 1903, p. 238 On the opposite end of each columns stood a half-column, making for a total of four main columns, eight half-columns, and four quarter columns (situated at each corner) inside the naos. The arches sit on lintels that span the space between the outer wall and the columns supporting the roof. There were six niches against the walls that were reserved for the placement of statues and in the center of them was the main space, the adyton, used to hold the main statue of the pagan cult. The adyton was topped by a conch-shaped falf-dome.Kaizer, 2008, p. 112 The building had two windows, a rare feature in Classical pagan temples, and a total of three entryways. Of the entry ways, there was a principal central doorway that was higher and broader than the two side-doors.Kaizer, 2008, p. 117 The church ruins contained a partially destroyed portico with six columns. The material used for the building was dry stone. Other than the dome and the portico, the building had been well preserved in the 19th century. Demographics According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), al-Masmiyah had a population of 1,498 in the 2004 census. It is the administrative center of the al-Masmiyah nahiyah (\\"subdistrict\\") which consists of 16 localities with a collective population of 8,773 in 2004.General Census of Population and Housing 2004. Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). Daraa Governorate. As of the early 20th century, its inhabitants were largely Melkite Christians, though there was a small Muslim community as well. In 2004, the village still had a significant Melkite Christian population.

He introduced the practice of skiing to his circle of friends at Grenoble, leading to the creation of the first ski club in France.  Bourgeois athlete  Henry Duhamel was born in Paris in 1853 and moved in 1873 to Gi√®res, near Grenoble, due to health problems. There, the young Parisian bourgeois developed a taste for the mountains, the practice of hiking, climbing, running and combined driving and strove to become an accomplished athlete. In 1874, Duhamel founded the Is√®re or Grenoble section of the Club alpin fran√ßais (French Alpine Club) and began to explore the peaks of Dauphin√©. In 1875, in the company of Baron Emmanuel Boileau de Castelnau and the guide Alexandre Tournier, Duhamel tried to climb the western peak of the Meije without reaching the summit. A second attempt the following year by the south side led to the foot of a wall deemed impassable. Finally in 1877 Boileau de Castelnau and his guide Pierre Gaspard reached the top, taking the first path traced by Henry Duhamel. Henry Duhamel turned to other peaks, both in France and Kabylie, and established twenty-three new routes, including first ascents of eight virgin peaks. He climbed the Pic Gaspard (3883 m) in 1878 and the south face of the Barre des √âcrins (the south ar√™te of the Pic Lory, 4088 m) in 1880 with Pierre Gaspard and his son. When French mountain climber Henri Cordier was killed in an accident on the slopes of Le Plaret in June 1877, Duhamel took charge of returning Cordier's body to La B√©rarde, where he photographed it.  Ski pioneer  Henry Duhamel moved in all seasons in the mountains of Dauphin√©, but the winter remained a problematic season. Horses and sleighs pulled by use of a coupling were limited when the snow reached dizzying heights. The athlete could not find a way to stay in shape with outdoor exercises. He considered snowshoes, but they were not suitable for hiking and he failed to find shoes manufactured with satisfactorily wide flanges. In 1878, looking for Canadian snowshoes, he visited the Exposition Universelle in Paris, where a Swedish representative showed him the long, narrow boards that his fellow Scandinavians used in winter. He bought the stand display of the unified kingdom of Norway and Sweden. They were snow skis, traditional wooden planks for sliding on snow. Duhamel purchased the skis without instructions on how to use them. Back in Gi√®res, he researched skis in his extensive library, finding a reference to their use by Arctic explorers in a 1539 Swedish encyclopedia. Duhamel realized that the simple lace binding was complex. Due to his lack of mastery of the link with an adapted shoe, he was awkward and took several years to master skiing technique. In 1889, with the best bindings cobbled together by a craftsman, he managed one successful trial to Chamrousse, which ended with a final somersault. He then undertook a trip to Finland in 1890 and met members of the Sami people (or \\"Lapps\\") already familiar with the terrain and the use of skis. The tests were successful; skiing became an enjoyable exercise and a tourist pleasure in the fresh air. Duhamel imported fourteen pairs of skis, equipped with good bindings produced in Norway, and proceeded to distribute them to his friends over the years. In November 1895, some of his athlete friends, skiers sufficiently distinguished, decided to gather in a ski club in imitation of the British. The association saw its constitution officially recognized on 1 February 1896. Recreational skiing for the urban bourgeois was born in France. The first president of the Alpine Ski Club was the founder of the Rock Club, Ernest Thorant. Henry Duhamel declined the presidency because he did not reside in Grenoble. On 1 March 1896 the first joint meeting and celebration under the eye of Alpine journalists was held in the presence of a monitor officer of the Swedish army from Lans-en-Vercors to Autrans, with return by Croix-Perrin. The Moniteur Dauphinois published an extensive account on 7 March 1896. The Alpine press described the technique and the equipment at length. Historians have questioned Duhamel's remarks about his ski trials in 1878 because he only claimed to have conducted them in late 1908, when skiing reached its first peak of popularity. The first winter ascent of the Croix de Belledonne in snowshoes cannot be attributed to Henry Duhamel. Photographic evidence exists that the first such ascent was conducted by Maurice Allotte of la Fuye on 23 February 1890. As a supporter of the mountain sports world, Duhamel sought to share his passion with others by publishing numerous articles for the CAF, a Guide du Haut-Dauphin√© in 1887 (in collaboration with W. A. B. Coolidge and F√©lix Perrin) which included a topography in color of the Mont Pelvoux massif, and a tribute to the Alpine troops, Au Pays des Alpins, in 1899.  Death  In 1914, Henry Duhamel was assigned to the 28th Bataillon Alpin de Chasseurs √† Pieds as a territorial captain. He was responsible for organizing the training of ski companies going to the Vosges front. As a volunteer instructor officer, he performed his last military mission at the age of sixty-three. Duhamel died on 7 February 1917 as the result of a fall on a patch of ice two months earlier in the courtyard of the barracks of Bonne, Haute-Savoie.  Legacy  Duhamel's library was dispersed at two sales in Lyon in 1921 and 1922. In honor of Duhamel, a street in Grenoble bears his name, as does the gap separating the Croix de Belledonne from the central peak of the Belledonne range, and one of the side peaks in the Massif des √âcrins (the Pyramide Duhamel). Duhamel appears as a character in the novel Le roman de Gaspard de la Meije by Isabelle Scheibli.

It allows rings of Ethernet switches to overcome any single failure with recovery time much faster than achievable with Spanning Tree Protocol. It is suitable to most Industrial Ethernet applications.  Properties  MRP operates at the MAC layer of Ethernet switches and is a direct evolution of the HiPER-Ring protocol developed by Hirschmann in 1998. Hirschmann is now owned by Belden. MRP is supported by several commercial Industrial Ethernet switches. In an MRP ring, the ring manager is named Media Redundancy Manager (MRM), while ring clients are named Media Redundancy Clients (MRCs). MRM and MRC ring ports support three status: disabled, blocked, and forwarding. Disabled ring ports drop all the received frames. Blocked ring ports drop all the received frames except the MRP control frames. Forwarding ring ports forward all the received frames. During normal operation, the network works in the Ring-Closed status (Figure 1). In this status, one of the MRM ring ports is blocked, while the other is forwarding. Conversely, both ring ports of all MRCs are forwarding. Loops are avoided because the physical ring topology is reduced to a logical stub topology. In case of failure, the network works in the Ring-Open status (Figure 2). For instance, in case of failure of a link connecting two MRCs, the MRM sets both of its ring ports to the forwarding state; the MRCs adjacent to the failure each have a blocked and a forwarding ring port; the other MRCs have both ring ports forwarding. Also, in the Ring-Open status, the network logical topology is a stub.  Standards  The International Electrotechnical Commission standard for MRP was published in 2010 as IEC 62439-2 and amended in 2012. The standard IEC 62439 published in 2012 also defined the following protocols: * Parallel Redundancy Protocol (PRP) * Cross-network Redundancy Protocol - CRP * Beacon Redundancy Protocol - BRP * High-availability Seamless Redundancy (HSR) With the settings specified in IEC 62439-2, MRP guarantees a worst-case recovery time of 500 ms, 200 ms, or 30 ms in rings composed of up to 50 switches, and a worst-case recovery time of 10 ms in rings composed of up to 14 switches.

M.P. for Midhurst in 1597 and for Bridgnorth 1604-10. His career has been described as a \\"tortuous trajectory rich in false starts, byways and rather nebulous interludes...[with] slippery religious and political allegiances\\". He was noted for his translations of courtly European literature. Particularly important was the translation of Gasparo Contarini's account of the Venetian republic, The Commonwealth and Government of Venice, which influenced contemporary writers including Shakespeare. He was also the author of an original work, The Estate of English Fugitives, a polemic attacking the Spanish and the machinations of Catholic clergy, while also defending the rights of English Catholics. Early career He was the son of Thomas Lewknor of Tangmere and Selsey and his wife Bridget Lewes. He studied at Cambridge and the Middle Temple, working for a short time as a lawyer with his uncle, Richard. His uncle Edmund Lewknor was tutor to the Jesuit priest John Gerard.The Autobiography of a Hunted Priest By John Gerard, Philip Caraman. p. 1 In the 1580s he was in the Low Countries, as an exile due to his Catholic sympathies. He attempted a career as a soldier, serving as a captain in the Duke of Parma's army, but suffered a disabling injury to his right arm. Lewkenor would later acknowledge the debt he owed to the General under whom he served, Jan Baptista del Monte, and his brother Camillo del Monte.The Estate of English Fugitives. 1595 In 1587 he was living in Antwerp with his wife, but returned to England after experiencing financial problems.Archives Generales du Royuame, Brussels, Papiers D‚Äôete et du Audience- A.G.R, P.E.A 1830/3 n.f. depositions of 9 and 13 February 1587; 23 July 1588. He reported to Lord Burghley about the activities of English Catholics working for the Spanish. He became a member of parliament for Midhurst in 1597. Lewknor served as a Gentleman Pensioner in Ordinary from 1599 to 1603. He appears to have accepted the Church of England after his return from the continent, but he returned to Catholicism after the death of Queen Elizabeth. Master of the Ceremonies Lewknor escorted Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud in 1600. Lewknor became an expert on ceremonial court protocol and as a Gentleman Pensioner, was required to host foreign ambassadors. In 1600 he looked after the French ambassador, travelling with him from Dover to London. In the same year he escorted the Moroccan ambassador Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud, suggested to be the inspiration for Shakespeare's Othello. After James I came to the throne in 1603, Lewknor's position was regularised. He was knighted in the same year and he was given the newly created post of Master of the Ceremonies, for which he received an annual salary of ¬£200. The post was confirmed for his lifetime in 1605. From this point on Lewknor's life was taken up with his duties to attend foreign dignitaries. An account of his expenses in September 1615 records his reception of French, Polish, and Venetian ambassadors who Lewkenor brought to James, Anne of Denmark, and Prince Charles, and he took the French and Venetian ambassadors hunting.HMC Laing Mauscripts in the University of Edinburgh, vol. 1 (London, 1914), pp. 144-5. He was assisted by John Finet, who eventually succeeded him in the post. The Venetian ambassador Zuane Pesaro described the Lord Chamberlain, William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke as ‚Äòa man of good intention,‚Äô but one who was ‚Äòinfluenced by being related to the Master of the Ceremonies.‚ÄôCalendar of State Papers Relating To English Affairs in the Archives of Venice, Volume 19, 1625-1626. Pesaro to the Doge and Senate, 21 August 1625 At the summoning of James I's first Parliament Lewknor‚Äôs uncle, Richard (chief justice of Chester and a prominent member of the Council in the Marches) secured his return for Bridgnorth. In the first session of the Parliament Lewes made five speeches and Between 1604 and 1610 he sat on 37 committees. The King also selected him to be among those ordered to manage the ‚Äòmatter of estate foreign or matter of intercourse‚Äô at the conference with the Lords of 28 April 1604 on the Union with Scotland. Writings Lewknor's publications were mostly translations of courtly and political works by continental European writers. He translated from French, Spanish and Italian, and is credited with coining \\"cashiering\\" from the Flemish \\"Kasserren\\"; \\"unnobly\\"; \\"well-expressed\\"; \\"unrefusable\\" and \\"Sinonical\\". In 1594 Lewknor translated The Resolved Gentleman, Hernando de Acu√±a's version of Olivier de la Marche's le Chevalier d√©lib√©r√©. Lewknor's version of this chivalric allegory has recently been interpreted as \\"a subtle, perceptive but scathing criticism of the Elizabethan court in the 1590s\\". The work was prefaced with dedicatory poems by Maurice Kyffin and Sir John Harington. Lewkenor praised his university friend, Edmund Spenser, in his introduction, \\"the following ages among millions of other noble works penned in her praise, shall as much admire the writer, but far more the subject of The Faerie Queen, as ever former ages did Homer and his Achilles, or Virgil, and his Aeneas\\". The title page of The Estate of English Fugitives, 1595. In 1595 A Discourse of the Usage of the English Fugitives, by the Spaniard was published, which became very popular having four reprintings in two years, expanded with the title The Estate of English Fugitives under the king of Spaine and his ministers. The book gave a colourful account of the author's adventures as a soldier of fortune in the Netherlands; it attacked the Spanish and the Catholic clergy, addressing English Catholics with the assertion that \\"They make you and other Catholics believe that what practices and drifts so ever they take in hand, are all for the zeale of religion...and you silly foules think all they saie to bee Gospell, whereas ‚Äì God Wot ‚Äì religion is the least matter of a thousand they think upon.\\" Published under the initials \\"L.L.\\", the work has been attributed to Lewknor. Despite the initials, it has also been sometimes incorrectly attributed to Lewes' brother Samuel Lewkenor, who had returned from Europe in 1594 and published an account of his travels. Literature historian Marco Nievergelt, however, says that Lewes is \\"generally accepted\\" as its author. In one paragraph Lewkenor expresses thanks to the general he served under in the Low Countries, Jan Baptista del Monte and his brother Camillo del Monte, and he repeats his gratitude in a similar paragraph in his next work The Commonwealth and Government of Venice. His 1599 translation of Gasparo Contarini's De Magistratibus et Republica Venetorum (as The Commonwealth and Government of Venice) demonstrates \\"the admiration Englishmen could express towards aristocratic republics\\". Lewknor described the republic as a combination of genius and divine favour: \\"as it were entertaining a league of intelligence with heavenly powers\\". Among the dedications are poems by Edmund Spenser, Maurice Kyffin, Sir John Astley (Master of the Revels) .The book influenced the portrayal of Venice in literature, notably in Shakespeare's plays, Othello especially, and Ben Jonson's Volpone. The book also included material adapted from other sources, including passages from Donato Gianotti's Libro de la Republica di Venetiana, providing additional historical information, and content from books giving details of local geography and customs. William Shakespeare may have also drawn the character of Puck (folklore) from reading Lewkenor's manuscript of The Spanish Mandevile of Miracles, or, The Garden of Curious Flowers, apparently a work written in his youth, was published in 1600. It is a translation of Antonio de Torquemada's, Le Jardin Flores Curiosas. The book was published by Ferdinando Walker in 1600 and dedicated to Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset who had been made Lord High Treasurer after the death of William Cecil, Lord Burghley in 1598. Walker states in his introduction \\"and keeping it by him many years, as judging it utterly unworthy of his own name, did lately bestow the same upon me, with express charge howsoever I should dispose thereof, to conceal all mention of him: wherein I should have done both him and my self too much wrong in obeying him.\\" Lewknor was one of Prince Henry's circle and contributed Old Wormy Age, a humorous panegyric verse, to the preface of Thomas Coryat's Coryat's Crudities: Hastily gobled up in Five Moneth‚Äôs Travels published in 1611. Family Sometime before 1588, while in the Spanish Netherlands, Lewknor married Beatrice de Rota. The couple had two sons, William,CSP Dom.

Lewknor's last official engagement was on Sunday 29 November 1626, when Charles I dispatched him to attend Fran√ßois de Bassompierre: \\"Lucnar came to bring me a very rich present from the king, of four diamonds set in a lozenge, and a great stone at the end; and the same evening sent again to fetch me to hear an excellent English play\\". Lewes Lewknor died on 11 March 1627 and his post of Master of the Ceremonies reverted to his assistant John Finet. Lewknor's son Thomas survived him, but having become a Jesuit priest he died childless in 1645.

He was a prominent Jewish leader in Vienna in the interwar period and in the nascent State of Israel, where he established his court in Tel Aviv. He was one of the first members of Agudat Israel and occupied a seat on the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah. Early life Palatial home of the Sadigura Rebbe in Sadigura Avrohom Yaakov Friedman was the fifth child of Rabbi Yisrael Friedman of Sadigura (1853-1907).Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 45. He was the grandson of Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov Friedman, the first Sadigura Rebbe; and the great-grandson of Rabbi Yisrael Friedman of Ruzhyn, founder of the Ruzhiner Hasidic dynasty.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 20. He was born within the year of mourning for his paternal grandfather and was named after him. He had four brothers: Rabbi Aharon of Sadigura (the Kedushas Aharon) (1877-1913), Rabbi Shlomo Yosef of Chernovitz, Rabbi Yitzhak of Rimanov, and Rabbi Shlomo Chaim (Reb Shlomenu) of Sadigura (1887-1972).Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, pp. 20, 45, 37. It is said that his father loved him the most of all his sons. He assiduously spent many hours in Torah study. He was engaged at the age of 11 to Bluma Raizel, daughter of Rabbi Yitzhak Meir Heschel of Kopychyntsi, the Kopshitzer Rebbe; they married when he was 18.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 36-37. The Sadigura synagogue in Sadhora Upon his father's death in 1907, he and his brothers all became Rebbes, making their courts and conducting their tishen in different halls in the great Sadigura synagogue.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 37. Rabbi Yisrael's eldest son, the Kedushas Aharon, died six years later, in 1912, and was succeeded by his 16-year-old son, Rabbi Mordechai Sholom Yosef Friedman.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, pp. 54-57. In 1914, with the outbreak of World War I, Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov fled to Vienna together with his younger brother, Rabbi Shlomo Chaim, and his orphaned nephew, Rabbi Mordechai Sholom Yosef. Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov established his court in Vienna and led the Sadigura Hasidim from that city for the next 24 years.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, pp. 38-39. The relocation of the Sadigura Rebbes to Vienna effectively put an end to the once-flourishing Jewish community in Sadigura, which comprised more than 5,000 Jews before World War I. The remaining Jews of the town were decimated by the Nazis during World War II. Move to Israel During the Anschluss of 1938, the Nazis entered Vienna and subjected leading rabbis to public humiliation. The Sadigura Rebbe was seized and forced to sweep the streets in front of laughing Germans. The Rebbe vowed that if he could escape Austria and get to the Land of Israel, he would gladly sweep the streets there. His Hasidim obtained a visa for him that year and for many months after he arrived in Tel Aviv, he swept the streets around his house early each morning. He stopped this practice only after one of his Hasidim noticed what he was doing.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 39. (footnote 27) He established his court on Nachmani Street.Marks, Yehudah. \\"Where Kodesh Meets Chol\\". Hamodia, Israel News, p. A14. January 29, 2015. Thousands of Sadigura Hasidim were murdered in the Holocaust, leaving the Rebbe with only a few dozen followers. Nonetheless, he continued to lead his Hasidim with dignity.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 41. He conducted his court in Tel Aviv for 22 years until his death in 1961. The Rebbe was actively involved in Jewish communal life in the new state of Israel. He was one of the first members of Agudat Israel and occupied a seat on the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah. He served as the \\"conscience\\" of Agudat Israel, steering the organization away from politics and toward its mission of religious advocacy. An epitome of honesty and truthfulness, he did not use polemics or protests to get his point across, but sincerity and straightforwardness. He always acceded to the majority view, even if it did not agree with his own. Personal The Rebbe was considered a tzadik and great Jewish leader. He was known for his wisdom and clear-cut, decisive answers. He was particular not to inconvenience others or accept favors from others.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 44. Like other Rebbes of the Ruzhiner dynasty, he was humble and modest on the outside, while on the inside he burned with love of God and fierce allegiance to Torah and mitzvahs. The Rebbe and his wife were childless. Final years and legacy The third Sadigura Rebbe's gravestone in the Nahalat Yitzhak Cemetery, Givatayim, Israel. The Rebbe's wife died three years before him. He died on December 24, 1961 (5 Tevet 5721) and was buried in the Ruzhiner section of the Nahalat Yitzhak Cemetery in Givatayim.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, pp. 45-46. His divrei Torah were collected in a volume under the name (Avir Yaakov). His Hasidim asked his younger brother, Rabbi Shlomo Chaim, to succeed him, but the latter demurred. He did agree to sit in his brother's place at tishen held on Jewish holidays and on the yahrtzeits of his Ruzhiner and Sadigura ancestors.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 46. Meanwhile, the Sadigura dynasty continued through the Rebbe's nephew, Rabbi Mordechai Sholom Yosef Friedman (1897-1979), who led Sadigura Hasidim in Sadigura and Przemy≈õl before emigrating to Tel Aviv in 1939. Upon his death in 1979, Rabbi Mordechai Sholom Yosef was succeeded by his son, Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov Friedman (1928-2013), who moved the Sadigura court from Tel Aviv to Bnei Brak.

Second Passover) occurs every year on 14 Iyar. This is exactly one month after 14 Nisan, the day before Passover, which was the day prescribed for bringing the Korban Pesach (\\"Paschal offering\\", i.e. Passover lamb) in anticipation of that holiday. As described in the source text for this mitzvah (), the Israelites were about to celebrate Passover one year after leaving Egypt. The offering of the Korban Pesach was at the core of that celebration. However \\"certain men\\"A baraita cited in the Babylonian Talmud Sukkah 25b offers two separate opinions: those carrying the body of Joseph (son of Jacob) (as per ), or those who buried Aaron's sons Nadav and Avihu (as a consequence of the events of ). were ritually impure from contact with human corpses, and were therefore ineligible to participate in the Korban Pesach. Faced with the conflict of the requirement to participate in the Korban Pesach and their ineligibility due to impurity, they approached Moses and Aaron for instructions, which resulted in the communication of the law of Pesach Sheni.Rashi, commenting on and quoting Sifrei, suggests that the law was communicated in this way in order to reward the merit of those who asked. Observance during the Temple period=Eligibility= As described in , a Jew may bring the Korban Pesach on Pesach Sheni if s/he was ritually impure due to contact with a dead body or was on a \\"distant journey\\". As elucidated in Mishnah Pesahim (9:1‚Äì4) and its Gemara:BT 92b‚Äì96a * The definition of \\"distant journey\\" for this purpose is generally construed liberally. * All types of ritual impurity are generally included, not only those due to contact with a human body. In net effect, anyone unavoidably prevented from offering the Korban Pesach on Passover may do so on Pesach Sheni. However one may not intentionally defer the Korban Pesach if it is in his/her power to offer it on Passover. =Similarities and differences compared to Passover= The Mishnah (9:3) and GemaraBT 95 a‚Äìb outline the following similarities and differences in the laws of the Korban Pesach when it is offered on Pesach Sheni, compared to when it is offered on Passover: Same: * The particulars of the sacrifice itself‚Äîwhat animals can be used, that it must be roasted, that it must be eaten together with matzo and bitter herbs, that its bones cannot be broken, that it is eaten until midnight, that any leftovers must be burned. * Hallel is recited during its offering, offering overrides Shabbat prohibitions, only those previously \\"registered\\" prior to slaughter may partake. Different: * The only restriction concerning chametz (leavened food) is that it cannot be eaten with the Korban Pesach. It is otherwise permissible to own it, and to see it in plain sunlight, unlike on Passover. * More generally, the full seven-day ·∏§ag haMatzot (Festival of Unleavened Bread)‚Äîthe holiday now commonly referred to as Passover‚Äîis not observed in conjunction with Pesach Sheni. * Hallel is not recited at the meal when the Korban Pesach is consumed, unlike on Passover. Observance in modern times Due to the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, Jews are unable to perform the Passover sacrifice, neither on Passover nor on Pesach Sheni. Some have the custom to eat matzo during Pesach Sheni in memory of the sacrifice. Others say that the reason for eating Matzo is because the 14th of Iyar was the day that the Matzo that was taken out of Egypt was finished. Some have the custom to omit Tahanun from the daily prayer service,See Siddur, Shacharit for weekdays. though this custom is not observed universally. =In Hasidism= Pesach Sheni is relatively prominent in Chabad as well as in Hasidic thought. One theme commonly expressed for this holiday is second chances.. In several Hasidic groups, the rebbe conducts a tish on Pesach Sheni. The Rebbes of Nadvorna and related groups conduct a tish with four cups of wine, matza and maror, in the manner of a seder.

It brought hundreds of students from East Africa from 1959 to 1963, and was supported by many North American educational institutions, foundations and individuals. These included the African American Students Foundation (AASF) and famous African Americans including Harry Belafonte, Jackie Robinson, Sidney Poitier and Martin Luther King Jr. It got its popular nickname in September 1960 when Senator Jack Kennedy, in a close Presidential campaign, arranged a $100,000 donation from the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr Foundation to cover airfare for the autumn 1960 group of East African students, just as the program was running out of funds. Background The program began in earnest in 1959 when Mboya embarked on a speaking tour of the United States seeking scholarships for students from East Africa. The first batch of 81 students touched down on New York City on September 11, 1959. These students would be settled in various universities in the United States and Canada. In Kenya, Mboya liaised with Julius Kiano and Kariuki Njiiri to identify potential students for the airlifts. Kiano and Njiiri were both alumni of American universities https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/magazine/Airlifts-to-the-US-The- first-Kenyans-to-study-in-America/434746-3472918-8ak1w4/index.html Kenyan Student Airlifts to America 1959-1961: An Educational Odyssey by Stephens, Robert F. The airlifts were opposed by Britain. Kenya was Britain's colony and Britain did not want the United States meddling with any of its colonies. British officials spread propaganda among top Kenyan students that American education was inferior to British education. Legacy The airlifts officially ended in 1963. Most of the graduates from American and Canadian colleges and universities went back to help build the newly independent Kenya. Some were employed even before they graduated. They were mainly employed in the public administration sector as district and provincial officers. While men found it easy to get jobs they qualified for, women faced a tougher challenge. Many were offered secretarial duties despite being better qualified than most male officers in the same departments. That said, the inclusion of women demonstrated foresight on the part of the airlift organisers. One of these women, Wangari Maathai, would win the Nobel Peace Prize, and another, Leah Marangu, would become the first female head of a university in Africa. Airlift to America. How Barack Obama, Sr., John F. Kennedy, Tom Mboya, and 800 East African Students Changed Their World and Ours by Tom Shachtman Overall the accomplishments of the airlift students were significant. Several of them became entrepreneurs, cabinet ministers, members of parliament, university professors and academics who went on to build their countries. The airlift program also influenced the United States presidential election of 1960. The African american vote, which largely went the way of John F. Kennedy as opposed as Richard Nixon, was largely influenced by the support that the Kennedy foundation gave to the program. Many of the airlift students were the first black students at the universities they attended. Their manner, determination and persistence impressed many of the host communities and as a result, opened doors to African american students to attend these universities, therefore contributing to the civil rights struggle. The 44th President of the United States, Barack Obama acknowledged that the airlift program enabled his Kenyan father to meet his Kansan mother. The other Obama- Kennedy connection.

Recognized in 2007, they are headquartered in Mashpee on Cape Cod. The other tribe is the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) on Martha's Vineyard. In 2019, the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe consisted of more than 2,900 enrolled members. In 2015 their 170 acres in Mashpee and an additional 150 acres in Taunton, Massachusetts were taken into trust on their behalf by the US Department of Interior, establishing these parcels as reservation land. On March 27, 2020, under the Trump Administration, the Tribal Council was informed by the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs that reservation designation would be rescinded and, with the US Department of the Interior, over 300 acres of land would be removed from the federal trust. Cedric Cromwell, the tribal chair, said this action is \\"unnecessary\\" and \\"cruel.\\" \\"This is an existential crisis for tribes,\\" said Jean-Luc Pierite, of the North American Indian Center, a Boston-based advocacy group. On June 6, a US District Court ruling reversed the Department of Interior's ruling ordered the DOI to maintain the reservation status of the tribe‚Äôs 321 acres of land until the department issues a new decision. History Indigenous peoples have been living on Cape Cod for at least 12,000 years. The historic Algonquian-speaking Wampanoag are one of 69 tribes of the original Wampanoag Nation; they are the Native people encountered by the English colonists of the New Plymouth Colony in the seventeenth century. The Wampanoag also controlled considerable coastal area. They are one of the several Algonquian-speaking tribal nations in what are now considered Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The Wampanoag and English (later European Americans) have interacted and shaped each other's cultures for centuries, with marriage between the groups also taking place. English colonists began to settle in and around the traditional tribal community of present-day Mashpee, Massachusetts also called Marshapoag (Big Pond), and Saukatukett (South Sea), in the 1630s when Rev Leverech of Sandwich began preaching there. He was later replaced in 1658 by missionary Rev Richard Bourne, from the neighboring town of Sandwich. In 1629 the Mashpee Wampanoag, along with eight other Wampanoag tribes granted ‚ÄúIndian Title‚Äù to the King of England to a tract of land that would become Plymouth Colony. In 1660, Bourne assisted the tribe in codifying the territory in at least one of two deeds. Beginning in 1665, the Wampanoag, petitioned the General Court for Mashpee‚Äôs status as a ‚Äòpraying town‚Äô, a form of government established by Missionary Rev John Eliot and confirmed by the General Court of the colony. In May 1666, a delegation of English leaders, including Richard Bourne, John Eliot and his son, John Cotton, Thomas Mayhew, and two Wampanoag interpreters convened a week-long meeting in Mashpee to hear from the Tribe regarding their petition (hearing the confessions) and report back to the General Court. The petition being granted, the Mashpees now governed themselves via the law of ‚Äòpraying towns‚Äô. Praying Town status afforded tribes protection of the English Crown and a greater chance to remain on their homelands. While this helped to maintain tenure in the land, these new laws also patterned English systems of justice and took away freedoms of the Wampanoag to live traditionally. The \\"Old Indian Meeting House\\", built in 1684 at Mashpee, is the oldest Native American church in the United States. Following the Wampanoag defeat in King Philip's War (1675‚Äì1676), those on the mainland were resettled with the Sakonnet in present-day Rhode Island. Other Wampanoag and the were forced to settle in the praying towns, such as Mashpee, in Barnstable County on Cape Cod. The colonists sold many Wampanoag men into slavery in the Caribbean, and enslaved women and children in New England. The colonists designated Mashpee on Cape Cod as the largest Native American reservation in Massachusetts. The town's name is an Anglicization of a native name, ‚ÄòM√¢seepee: 'm√¢s‚Äô meaning ‚Äòlarge‚Äôand, ‚Äòupee‚Äô meaning ‚Äòwater‚Äô. So named for Mashpee/Wakeby Pond; the largest fresh water pond on Cape Cod. In 1763, the British Crown designated Mashpee as a plantation of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, against the will of the Wampanoag. By this designation, the Crown gave the colonial district of Mashpee authority to integrate into its territory the area governed by the Mashpee Wampanoag. The colony gave the natives the \\"right\\" to elect their own officials to maintain order in their area, but otherwise subjected them to colonial government. The Wampanoag population of the plantation declined steadily due to social disruption and infectious disease contracted from the colonists. They also suffered from continuing encroachment on their lands by the English. Following the American Revolutionary War, the State in 1788 revoked Mashpee self-government, which European-American officials considered a failure. They appointed a committee of overseers, consisting of five European-American members, to supervise the Mashpee. When William Apess, a Pequot Methodist preacher, helped the Mashpee Wampanoag lead a peaceful protest in 1837 against the overseers, who did not protect the Wampanoag from colonists stealing their wood, the governor threatened a military response. Rule by the overseers resulted in the loss of additional Wampanoag lands. =Nineteenth-century restrictions and land loss= In 1834, the state returned a certain level of self-government to the Wampanoag, although they were not completely autonomous. With the idea that emulating European-American farming would encourage assimilation, in 1842 the state broke up some of the Wampanoag communal land. It distributed of their property in allotments of parcels to heads of households, so that each family could have individual ownership for subsistence farming. The legislature passed laws prohibiting European Americans from encroaching on Wampanoag land, but the state did not enforce these. The competing settlers also stole wood from the reservation. The Wampanoag held a large region, once rich in wood, fish and game, which was desired by white settlers. They envied the growing community of Mashpee. The Mashpee Indians suffered more conflicts with their white neighbors than did other more isolated or less desirable Indian settlements in the state.Handbook of North American Indians. Chapter: \\"Indians of Southern New England and Long Island, late period,\\" p. 178ff; The Seaconke Wampanoag Tribe official website ; Mashpee Wampanoag Nation webpage; Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head Aquinnah webpage In 1870 the state, against a vote of the Tribe, incorporated the Town of Mashpee as a Town. It was the second-to-last jurisdiction on the Cape to undergo the process. Mashpee Wampanoag held every seat in Town Government until 1967. With European Americans moving to Mashpee in growing numbers and taking seats in town government, ultimately the Mashpee Wampanoag lost control of town government. The majority of the Tribe‚Äôs citizens live in and around Mashpee today. Many also worked on whaling and other ships that operated from Cape and other Massachusetts ports in the 19th century. They continue to identify as Mashpee Wampanoag by their common culture. Census rolls of the Tribe grew from marriages and mixed-race children as they formed unions with neighbors. =20th century = Beginning in the 1970s, the Mashpee Wampanoag worked to regain its political power; it sought federal recognition of its tribal status by the federal government. The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribal Council, Inc was incorporated in 1972 under the leadership of its first president, Russell \\"Fast Turtle\\" Peters. In 1974 the Council petitioned the Bureau of Indian Affairs for recognition. Like other \\"landless\\" tribes of the Atlantic Coast area, they encountered difficulties documenting their continuity. The recognition process required documentation of continued existence since first contact with European arrivals. In many areas, outsiders assumed that, as tribes became multi-racial, they no longer were \\"Indians.\\" But the Mashpee Wampanoag had experience in continuing their culture, and most of their descendants identified as Wampanoag. The federal acknowledgment petition documents were a collection of 54,000 pages before the petition was considered by the Department of Interior Office of Federal Acknowledgement. In 1976 the tribe filed a landmark land claim lawsuit, suing the Town of Mashpee for the return of ancestral homelands. The US District Court ruled that, lacking federal recognition as a tribe, the Mashpee Wampanoag people had no standing to pursue the land claim. The tribe continued to pursue federal recognition for three decades, gaining it in 2007. =21st century= In 2000 the Mashpee Wampanoag Council was headed by chairman Glenn Marshall. Marshall led the group until 2007, when it was disclosed that he had a prior conviction for rape, had lied about having a military record, and was under investigation associated with the tribe's casino lobbying efforts.\\"WampaGate ‚Äì Glenn Marshall: There is still much to tell\\", Cape Cod Times, 26 August 2007. Marshall was removed from office by the Tribe and was a succeeded by tribal council vice-chair Shawn Hendricks. He held the position until Marshall pleaded guilty in 2009 to federal charges of embezzling, wire fraud, mail fraud, tax evasion, and election finance law violations.\\"Former Wampanoag leader sentenced\\", The Boston Globe, May 8, 2009.\\"Marshall Timeline\\" , Cape Cod Times, August 25, 2007 Marshall had steered tens of thousands of dollars in illegal campaign contributions to politicians through the tribe's hired lobbyist Jack Abramoff. The latter was convicted of numerous charges in a much larger fraud scheme associated with Native American gaming, especially related to his representation of a Mississippi tribe. On May 23, 2007, the Mashpee Tribe gained formal federal recognition as a tribe. Led by its chairman Shawn Hendricks, who was elected to succeed Marshall, tribe representatives worked with Abramoff's lobbyist colleague Kevin A. Ring to pursue a plan to develop Indian gaming, as this seemed a route to generate revenues to help the tribe take care of its people.\\"Cape tribe feels heat from lobbyist scandal\\" , Cape Cod Times, September 11, 2008. In 2008 Ring was indicted and convicted on federal corruption charges linked to his work for the Mashpee band. During this period, there was considerable internal tension within the tribe. Tribal elders sought access to the tribal council records detailing the council's involvement in the Ring scandal, filing a complaint in Barnstable Municipal Court. The tribal council voted to formally \\"shun\\" these members, banning these elders from the tribe for seven years. The federal government had also sought records from the tribe as part of its 2007 investigation into Abramoff and his colleagues.\\"Fed letter demands 8 pages of tribe's letters to Abramoff, others\\" , Cape Cod Today, 9 October 2007. In 2009 the tribe elected council member Cedric Cromwell to the position of council chair and president. Cromwell's campaign had promised reforms. He worked to distance himself from the previous chairmen, although he had served on the tribal council for the prior six years during which the Marshall and Abramoff scandals took place. He was among those who voted to shun tribal members who tried to investigate.\\"Cedric Cromwell elected chairman\\" , Cape Cod Times, February 2, 2009. A challenge to Cromwell's election by defeated candidates, following allegations of tampering with voting and enrollment records, was filed with the Tribal Court. Cromwell's administration has been hampered by a series of protests by elders over casino-related finances.\\"Mashpee Wampanoag elders gather outside tribal headquarters yesterday, seeking information about the tribe's finances since Chairman Cedric Cromwell took over\\", Cape Cod Times, 24 September 2009.Nellie Hicks Ramos v.

Meanwhile, the tribe continued to negotiate with the state to gain a license to develop a casino on its land in Taunton. \\"In 2013, the Mashpee and the state reached an agreement that would see the group give Massachusetts 17 percent of all casino revenue it generated. However, those payments were contingent on the state not licensing a[nother] casino in the region.\\"Kevin Horridge, \\"Surprise Massachusetts Casino Could Result from New Mashpee Wampanoag Land Grant\\", Casino.org, 21 September 2015; accessed 19 January 2017 In September 2015 the Department of Interior took into trust 321 acres in Mashpee and Taunton, MA as a reservation for the Mashpee Wampanoag, who had held the land in fee simple. As reported by Casino.org, \\"This is a reclamation of land that was once ours,\\" tribal chairman Cedric Cromwell told The Boston Globe. \\"Tribal lands once stretched from Cape Ann to Rhode Island, and this new reservation represents only a dot on the map, but it feels really good.\\" On March 27, 2020, the Bureau of Indian Affairs reportedly told the tribe that their reservation will be dis-established and their land taken out of trust, per an order from Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt.https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/31/trump- administration-revokes-mashpee-wampanoag-tribe-reservation-status  Membership  The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribal Council has established criteria for enrollment as a member. The 2012 amended ordinance is at \\"Enrollment Amended Ordinance and 09 2012 Amendment\\". The tribe requires that a person be able to document descent from recognized members, and it requires persons to live in or near Mashpee, and to be active in the tribe. Land and casino After gaining federal recognition, the tribe lobbied the state for approval to build a casino on their Mashpee land. Indian gaming operations are regulated by the National Indian Gaming Commission established by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. It contains a general prohibition against gaming on lands acquired into trust by federally recognized tribes after October 17, 1988, the date of the act.\\"Indian Land Options\\" , National Indian Gaming Commission The tribe's attempts to gain approvals have been met with legal and government approval challenges, as it did not continuously control a reservation before this date.

This is about 48 miles driving distance from Mashpee. They were challenged by the Pocasset Wampanoag, which was also seeking an agreement for a casino.\\"Pocasset Mashpee Wampanoags at odds over which tribe should get casino license for Taunton\\", Enterprise Press, April 18, 2012. The state said it would accept the tribe's bid for a casino at that location, as one of three the state intends to authorize. By 2014, the tribe was completing an FEIS for development of the property in Taunton, as well as property it owns in Mashpee. The latter is to be developed for administrative office needs. By 2010, the Wampanoag Tribe's plan had agreement for financing by the Malaysian Genting Group. It had gained the political support of Massachusetts Senator John Kerry,WPRI News, \\"Sen.

Marshall was later implicated in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal. = Land trust = In September 2015, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, an agency within the U.S. Department of the Interior, approved the tribe's application to take 321 acres of land into federal trust to create the Mashpee Wampanoag reservation; this included 170 acres of land the tribe already controlled in Mashpee and also gave the tribe jurisdiction over 150 newly acquired acres in Taunton.\\"Mashpee Receive 321 Acres: First Trust Land Decision\\" , Indian Country Today, 18 September 2015 In February 2016, a group of Taunton property owners filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court against the Mashpee Wampanoag's plans to build a gaming casino on the tribe's land in Taunton. They challenged the land-into-trust deal, citing Carcieri v. Salazar (2009), a U.S. Supreme Court decision which held that the government could not take land into trust for tribes recognized after the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act. The City of Taunton filed a brief in favor of the casino, as its residents had voted strongly in favor of its development, and Interior Department lawyers brought into question of Congress' original intent in making the 1934 law.Sean P. Murphy, \\"Judge promises quick decision on challenge to Taunton casino\\", The Boston Globe, 11 July 2016; accessed 18 January 2017 Meanwhile, despite the court challenge, the Mashpee Wampanoag began development of the Taunton site. In July 2016, the U.S. district court found that the BIA had exceeded its authority, entered summary judgment for the plaintiffs, and ordered the matter remanded to the BIA.Littlefield v. Mashpee Wampanoag Indian Tribe, No. 16-2484 (1st Cir. 2020) In February 2020, the First Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the district court, maintaining that the Department of Interior lacked authority to take tribal land into trust for the benefit of the tribe. On March 27, 2020, the Trump administration announced it would remove over 300 acres of land from the federal trust and take away the designation of \\"reservation.\\" A hearing was scheduled for U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. on May 7, 2020.

In 1974, Withers converted to Catholicism and was baptized; shortly after, he started to live a religious life. In 1989, Withers and Sister Margaret McKenna moved to inner city Philadelphia and founded New Jerusalem Laura, a drug treatment center. Withers petitioned the Archdiocese of Philadelphia to become a consecrated hermit several times but was rejected. In 2001, Withers was consecrated as a hermit by Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, the Archbishop of Philadelphia. He was the first hermit to be consecrated in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. Withers lives in a hermitage, a converted rowhouse, in the city of Philadelphia where he spends most of his time in prayer. Early life Withers was born in California's San Fernando Valley. He had seven siblings and his father was a mechanical engineer. Neither of his parents were practicing Catholics during his childhood. His father had been raised Catholic but then \\"lapsed\\". Instead, he was raised culturally Jewish according to the faith of his mother. When Withers was eight, his family moved to Cherry Hill, New Jersey. In 1974, he had an encounter with a group of Catholic activists at the bicycle repair shop where he worked, which caused him to convert to Catholicism and be baptized. The same year, Withers left home for nearby Camden, New Jersey, to live in and repair abandoned row houses. Religious life After his baptism, Withers lived in a loosely affiliated religious community. While there, Withers almost got married but decided that he wanted to live a religious life instead. In 1984, he took private vows of \\"poverty, chastity, and obedience\\" and became a hermit. Before taking his vows, Withers had looked into several religious orders, but he could not find one that he felt compatible with. Passionate about the spirituality of the Desert Fathers, he and Sister Margaret McKenna debated about \\"Where is the desert today?\\" Deciding it was in the abandoned inner cities, in 1989 they moved into an abandoned row house that they began restoring, continuing their work even when their tools were regularly stolen by drug addicts. There, they founded New Jerusalem Laura, a treatment center for drug addicts. Two years later, in 1991, Withers bought a derelict rowhouse from the city of Philadelphia for $1 and parted ways with McKenna. This would become his hermitage. He fixed the building, which lacked doors, windows, or a working roof and then went on to build furniture for it by himself. After the 1983 revision of Canon 603, the option of being a consecrated hermit while independent of the system of religious orders had been permitted. In 1995, Withers attempted to be consecrated by the Archdiocese of Philadelphia but was rejected. In 2001, Withers was finally approved and consecrated as a hermit by Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua and took his public vows. Withers was the first hermit to be consecrated by the Archdiocese. =Life as a hermit= As a hermit, Withers lives in solitude. He does not own a car or television; he gets his news from the people around him and gets around on a bicycle that he found, broken, on the side of the road. Though he has an open-door policy for people that come to visit him, he himself visits family only twice a year. He does have a computer, which he uses to keep in touch with other hermits via email. To earn his food and clothing allowance, which amounts to less than $5,500 per year, Withers makes pottery to sell and works one day a week for a scientific- instrument company. & At the end of each year, he donates any funds that remain to charity. Withers wakes up at 5 AM and then fills his day with prayer and chores, following his rule of life. He prays for 4¬Ω hours each day. Withers claims that \\"it's in the solitude that I hear God best\\".

It was given a theatrical release in the United States by Emerson Film Enterprises in 1975. A novelisation by Fuller appeared in the US. Overview An American private detective is killed in Germany while possessing incriminating photos, and his partner (Glenn Corbett) seeks revenge. Joining with the seductive blonde (Christa Lang) who appeared in the photos, the investigator hopes to discover who was behind them, and why his partner was killed for having them. Production history Fuller was offered the opportunity to direct an episode of the popular German crime drama by film critic (and later writer/director) Hans-Christoph Blumenberg in appreciation for the director's help in securing interviews with filmmakers Howard Hawks and John Ford for a documentary project. Upon meeting with the program's producers and feeling initial doubts about being able to conform to the show's standard template, he suggested a storyline inspired by the then-recent Profumo affair in England, which the producers approved to Fuller's surprise.Iseeadarktheater.com Fuller's screenplay took liberties with the established style of the show by eliminating a primary series protagonist early in the episode in order to introduce a one-time American character to helm the investigation, by conducting the majority of the program in English rather than German (though subtitles were provided in the German broadcast), and by ultimately treating the story with a satirical and often broadly comic tone. Restoration In March 2015, the UCLA Film and Television Archive premiered a restored director's cut which added additional footage previously unseen in its television broadcast or theatrical release.

Plot The story is set on a floating island populated by pirates and lepers off the shores of 17th century Taiwan. There are two beautiful courtesans, White Snow and White Frost, who are the top attraction for at the establishment of businesswoman Moon. The sisters, known as the Rippling Sisters of Flower Street, are known for their flirtatious love duets. Men from everywhere vie for their hearts, ready to deflower them. Though they are twins, the sisters have very different personalities. While Snow is reserved and unyielding, Frost is wild and rebellious. Both guard a terrible secret. Affected by leprosy, the sisters must inflict a man with the illness to regain their own health. Meanwhile, a naive young music teacher named Wen arrives at Flower House to teach the girls new opera songs. Snow is told by Moon to inflict Wen, but the kind-hearted Snow, touched by his gentleness and talent, chose to sacrifice herself. Moon then had Frost replace Snow as the stage star and sure enough, Frost became the top courtesan in place of Snow. The ever practical Frost chides and ridicules Snow for jeopardizing everything they've sacrificed so much for. Meanwhile, even though Frost is in love with her platonic childhood friend (Scarface), she chose the rich and lustful merchant, Sir Li. In order to make her sister give up on her love, Frost plans a grand dynastic scheme to convince Snow that love is a fools game. The scheme entangles them with unscrupulous pirates, a philandering husband, a vindictive wife and kidnappings and murders.

The design features a single three-bladed main rotor that was built in-house, a two-seats-in side-by-side configuration enclosed bulbous cockpit, tricycle landing gear mounted on stub wings, a triple tail and a single four cylinder liquid-cooled Subaru automotive engine in pusher configuration. The aircraft's frame is made from aluminium and the cabin is of non-structural fiberglass. The aircraft is equipped with a helicopter-style collective pitch control to allow \\"jump\\" takeoffs. Take-offs are accomplished by powering the rotor system to 150% cruise rpm and then increasing collective rapidly to jump the aircraft into the air where it can then fly away. Operational history The sole example was built in 2005 and registered in the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration in the Experimental - Amateur-built category on 21 March 2005. It first flew in about February 2006. The aircraft was first shown publicly at Wauchula, Florida during the Bensen Days show in April 2005 as a static display, since it had not then yet flown. It was first flown publicly during Bensen Days in April 2006. The prototype was exported to Spain and its US registration was cancelled on 11 April 2008.

He is best known today for his Excursions Daguerriennes, books of views of the world's monuments, based on early photographs redrawn by hand as Aquatint engravings. Early life Lerebours was born in Paris of an unknown father. His mother, Marie Jeanne Fran√ßoise Paymal, a seamstress from Vitry-sur-Marne, worked in Rue Froidmanteau, Tuileries, Paris. She married Jean Lerebours, an optician, who adopted the child on 11 June 1836. On the death of his adoptive father, Lerebours took over the optician's shop in the Place du Pont-Neuf and formed a partnership with Marc Secretan in 1845, the firm being known as Lerebours et Secretan. As well as producing high quality lenses and glasses for astronomical observatories, during the years 1840-1850 Lerebours was equally interested in improving daguerreotype photography. Career In the autumn of 1839, Lerebours used his skill in optics to manufacture and sell a sliding box whole-plate camera, copied from the instruction manual for Daguerre's pioneering instrument. Lerebours noted in 1842 that in just two months he had taken 1500 portraits. Among these were daguerreotypes of the King, Louis- Philippe of France and Queen Am√©lie, in June or July 1842. Lerebours and Antoine Claudet took the royal portraits at a distance of 2 metres using daylight from the large windows of the Tuileries palace. The exposure time was 85 seconds using 1/4 plate double lens cameras. Aquatint engraving \\"View from the Pont Neuf, Paris\\" from Lerebours' Excursions Daguerriennes He took an early astronomy photograph, of the sun, in that year, 1842, but the plate revealed little detail due to overexposure (solarisation). His colleague Hippolyte Fizeau, working with the physicist Jean Bernard L√©on Foucault made the first plate showing sunspots in 1844. His studio soon became a major meeting place and centre of innovation in daguerreotype photography. He worked with Fizeau and Marc Antoine Gaudin, with whom he claimed he could make images in a tenth of a second, which was exceptional for that time. The first plate photographs were tried out using Fizeau's sensitization methods. In his workshop there were panoramic daguerreotypes of the river Seine, preserved today in the Carnavalet Museum. Lerebours is known for his Excursions Daguerriennes, books of views of the world's monuments, based on early photographs, produced in Paris in a number of subscription volumes between 1841 at the dawn of photography and 1864. Some of the photographs, of the Niagara Falls as well as of Rome and Paris, were taken by the English industrial chemist Hugh Lee Pattinson. These were then transferred to engravings to illustrate Lerebours' Excursions Daguerriennes (Paris, 1841-1864). However, the manual process of translating the photographs to aquatint engravings took away the immediacy of the real daguerreotypes, whatever the gains in quality. In 1851, Lerebours was one of the founders of the first photographic society, the Soci√©t√© H√©liographique. Lerebours retired in 1855. He died in Neuilly-sur-Seine.

William Wilson (1809 ‚Äì 1862) was an English mechanical engineer and first engine driver on the first German railway.  Life  William Wilson was born on 18 May 1809 in Walbottle, Northumberland, England, and in 1829 was engaged by George Stephenson as a mechanic. The first railway line in Germany was opened on 7 December 1835 between Nuremberg and F√ºrth. Its first steam locomotive was supplied by Stephenson, because at that time there were no suitable and affordable steam engines available in Germany. At the request of the Ludwig Railway Company (Ludwigs-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft), Stephenson also provided Wilson to act as engine driver and engineer. He was to instruct the locomotive crew and train successors, for which he was given an eight-month contract. Stephenson stipulated a maximum working period of 12 hours per day and Wilson's travel costs were borne by the Ludwig Railway Company. In addition, he took on the fitting out, and later the direction, of a railway workshop. He was given a high salary commensurate with his qualification that exceeded the income of the general manager (Generaldirektor) of the railway company. His pay was initially 1,500 gulden per annum; in addition he received a bonus of 240 gulden. On 7 December 1835 William Wilson finally drove the locomotive, Adler, as the engine driver, on the first German railway on the newly built line operated by the Ludwig Railway. After eight months he made no arrangements to leave. Both as a result of his safe performance during this journey as well as his excellent credentials, his contract was repeatedly extended. The passengers wanted to travel with no one else but the \\"tall Englishman\\". Whenever he was not driving the locomotive himself, income fell. From 1842 he alternated as engine driver with his assistant, Bockm√ºller. His health was seriously damaged by his occupation, however, because he would stand on the driver's platform in all weathers in a gentleman's overcoat and top hat, but without any protection from the elements. Not until the winter of 1845/46 were engine drivers given leather coats as protection against the weather. Finally, eight years later, the engines were furnished with protective roofs over the driver's stand. In spite of tempting offers by the Bavarian State Railway, Wilson remained with the Ludwig Railway. In 1859, he was unable to work regularly as a result of his worsening health.M√ºck, Wolfgang: Deutschlands erste Eisenbahn mit Dampfkraft. Die kgl. priv.

He was buried at St. John's Cemetery in Nuremberg, his funeral being attended by a large section of the population. His grave is still visible today.

Desaide, 1902, t. 2 pp. 210-211 Neither Louis nor any member of his family used the surname de Brienne. According to Saint-Simon's memoirs, Louis's branch of the family had fallen on hard times, but rose back into the upper circles of the court via Louis's father's and uncles's marriage to two daughters of Claude de Jussac, captain of the 'gardes de Monsieur', the regiment guarding the king's younger brother. Life In 1717 he inherited the post of first gentleman of the chamber to the duc d'Orl√©ans from his father, though Louis's uncles exercised the post in Louis's name. He joined the musketeers aged 15 in 1726 and was given command of the Anjou Infantry Regiment on 16 September 1727, aged 16. During the War of the Polish Succession he served in Italy from 1733 to 1735. On 19 September 1734, he fought at Guastalla under the mar√©chal de Coigny and was wounded in the neck by a musket shot. On 18 October 1734 he became a brigadier, aged only 23. He served in the Bohemian expedition during the first phase of the War of the Austrian Succession, under mar√©chal de Belle-Isle. He returned to France in February 1743 and was made a mar√©chal de camp on 20 February that year. He then joined the arm√©e d'Alsace during its campaign in Flanders. He fought at Rocourt on 11 October 1746 and brought Louis XV news of the victory. This gained him promotion to lieutenant g√©n√©ral on the following 14 October. He continued serving in the war until 1748 and was appointed to the Order of the Holy Spirit on 1 January 1753. During the Seven Years' War he initially served in Germany under marshals de Soubise and de Contades, before being put in command of the Trois Ev√™ch√©s (Metz, Toul and Verdun) in 1761.

Early life Ferdinando Cospi was born in Bologna in 1606, son of Constance de 'Medici and Vincenzo Cospi. His father belonged to an ancient Bolognese family. In December 1601, Vincenzo Cospi was involved in a fight in which he mortally wounded his opponent. Sentenced to death, he fled to Florence. He was befriended by the future Grand Duke Ferdinando I, who made him a courtier. In August 1604 Vincenzo Cospi married a great-granddaughter of Cardinal Alessandro Ottaviano de' Medici, who the next year was briefly Pope Leo XI before dying in office. Vincenzo Cospi was pardoned, and in 1606 was in Bologna, where Ferdinando Cospi was born. In 1610 Vincenzo was involved in another fight, this time bloodless, but was again forced to flee to Florence. Here, at the age of eight, Ferdinando Cospi became a page of Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. In 1616 he joined the Order of the Knights of St. Stephen, but so he would not have to serve on a galley he was made a page of the grand master, who was also the Grand Duke, and who brought him up with his children. When Cosimo II died in 1621, Ferdinando II promoted Cospi to a page of the black livery, and took him to live in the Palazzo Vecchio. Later career Ferdinando Cospi from the catalog of his museum Cospi‚Äôs father died in Bologna in 1624, and he inherited the family property and position. He became the representative of the Grand Duke Ferdinando II in Bologna. This involved formal diplomatic services and attendance at functions and ceremonies. He mediated between the Bolognese and Tuscan authorities, and promoted trade and the interests of Florence in Bologna. He also helped the Medicis to obtain the services of Bolognese artists. In 1637 Cospi married Smeralda di Annibale Banzi. They had just one daughter, Dorotea, although Cospi was said to have had a child in Florence whom the Granduchess Vittoria della Rovere accepted as one of her court ladies. As the value of his services increased, the Grand Duke increased Cospi‚Äôs salary and in 1641 made him bailiff of Arezzo within the Order of St. Stephen. In 1643 Cospi escorted the new Cardinal Giancarlo de' Medici to Rome to receive his cap. In 1646 he undertook a mission to Milan to pay respects on behalf of the Grand Duke to the new governor, Bernardino Fern√°ndez de Velasco, 6th Duke of Fr√≠as. Two years later he was given the hereditary title of Marquis of Petriolo. On 9 May 1650 he became a senator of Bologna. The next year he made another trip for the Cardinal Giancarlo de' Medici to pay his respects to Mariana of Austria, the new Queen of Spain. In 1664, 1665 and 1672 he was Gonfaloniere of Bologna. In 1673 Cospi resigned from the office of senator, but continued to take part in public life. He died in Bologna on 19 January 1686 and was buried in San Petronio in the family chapel. Cabinet of Curiosities The Cabinet of Curiosities On 28 June 1660 Cospi donated his museum to the Senate. It seems that Tatto had already compiled a short printed catalog of the collection. In 1667 Cospi printed, at his expense, a full description of the ‚Äò‚ÄôMuseo Cospiano‚Äô‚Äô in five volumes. The first two described the natural history specimens and the last three covered the archaeological objects. A picture of the \\"Cabinet of Curiosities\\" has been preserved. It includes truly natural specimens as well as some man-made specimens of fictitious animals such as a winged fish and a Hippocampus, half horse and half fish. In the picture, the bust of Dante Alighieri forms the centerpiece of the collection. Below and to its right is the dwarf Sebastiano Biavati, a living member of his collection, and Cospi himself stands to the right. The collection was combined with a collection made by Ulisse Aldrovandi. In 1743 the Academy of Sciences of Bologna Institute obtained the donation of this collection, the Naturalia Museum.

The book was published on May 14, 2013, ten years after publication of The Da Vinci Code (2003), by Doubleday. It was number one on the New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover fiction and Combined Print & E-book fiction for the first eleven weeks of its release, and also remained on the list of E-book fiction for the first seventeen weeks of its release. A film adaptation was released in the United States on October 28, 2016. Plot Harvard professor Robert Langdon, professor of symbolism, wakes up in a hospital in Florence, Italy with a head wound and no memory of the last few days. Dr. Sienna Brooks, one of the doctors tending to him, reveals that he is suffering from amnesia. When Vayentha, a female assassin, shows up in the hospital and kills Dr. Marconi, Brooks helps Langdon escape, and they flee to her apartment. After Brooks recounts the details of his admission to the hospital, Langdon finds a cylinder with a biohazard sign in his jacket and decides to call the U.S. consulate. He is told that they are searching for him and want his location. Per Brooks' guidance, he gives them a location across the street from her apartment to avoid getting Brooks more involved in his mysterious situation than she already is. Soon, Langdon sees Vayentha pull up to the location he gave the consulate. At this point, they both believe the U.S. government wants to kill him. Langdon then decides to open the container and finds a small medieval bone cylinder fitted with a hi- tech projector that displays a modified version of Botticelli's Map of Hell, which is based on Dante's Inferno. A trail of clues leads them toward the Old City. The Palazzo Vecchio in Florence However, they are dismayed to find that a secretive team of soldiers, and the Florentine Carabinieri are also searching for them. They flee into a construction site near the Boboli Gardens where he examines the \\"Map of Hell\\" again, noticing several subtle changes to the layers. Langdon discovers a phrase from the painting The Battle of Marciano by Vasari, located in the Palazzo Vecchio. They manage to evade the soldiers and get into the Old City using the Vasari Corridor. At the Palazzo, a custodian sees Langdon snooping around and gets the director of the museum, Marta Alvarez. Alvarez recognizes him, having met him and Ignazio Busoni, the director of Il Duomo, the previous night. She leads them up a set of stairs by The Battle of Marciano, and Langdon realizes the top of the stairs is on the same level as the words \\"cerca trova\\" in the Battle of Marciano painting. Alvarez tells him that she showed them Dante's death mask the previous night, which sits in a room down the hall from the Battle of Marciano painting. He realizes he is retracing his own steps from the previous night. Finding the mask gone, security footage shows Langdon and Busoni stealing the mask. Fleeing the guards, they listen to a message Busoni left telling him where the mask is hidden, referring to \\"Paradise 25\\" Gates of Paradise at Florence Baptistry Langdon and Brooks escape the guards, but the soldiers arrive. They cross the attic over the Apotheosis of Cosimo I, where Brooks pushes Vayentha to her death. Langdon connects the phrase \\"Paradise 25\\" to the Florence Baptistry, where they find the Dante mask along with a riddle from its current owner, a billionaire geneticist named Bertrand Zobrist. She explains that Zobrist was a geneticist who advocated the halting of humanity's growth, due to its out of control population and that he was rumored to be working on a means to do so using an engineered disease. A man named Jonathan Ferris, with a large bruise on his chest which he hides from the two, and a severe rash on his face, claiming to be from the World Health Organization (WHO), comes and helps them escape the soldiers. They follow the riddle to Venice, where Ferris suddenly falls unconscious, with Brooks claiming he is suffering from massive internal bleeding, causing Langdon to suspect Ferris has been infected with Zobrist's plague. He is captured by a group of black-clad soldiers while she escapes. Langdon is taken to Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey, the director-general of the WHO, and is given an explanation of what is going on: Zobrist, who committed suicide the week before, was a brilliant geneticist and Dante fanatic who had supposedly developed a new biological plague that will cause infertility in a third of the worlds population in order to quickly solve the problem of the world's impending overpopulation, citing the Doomsday Argument. Sinskey raided Zobrist's safe deposit box, found the cylinder and flew him to Florence to follow the clues. However, he stopped communicating with Sinskey after meeting with Alvarez and Ignazio and the WHO feared he betrayed them and was working with Zobrist to unleash the plague. The soldiers were the WHO's emergency response team and never meant to kill him. Zobrist had paid a shadowy consulting group called The Consortium to protect the cylinder until a certain date. He also left a disturbing video filled with Dante imagery, which also showed a picture of the plague itself, kept in a hidden underwater location, within a slowly dissolving bag. The video claims that the world will be changed the following morning. When Sinskey took it away, they abducted Langdon and staged every event up to this point so that he would be motivated to solve it. The leader of The Consortium, having become aware of the bioterrorism plot, agrees to cooperate with the WHO. Ferris' rash was due to an allergic reaction to the spirit gum he used as part of the disguise as the doctor Vayentha \\"murdered.\\" His bruises were because the squib used to simulate him being shot in the chest misfired and broke his ribs. He collapsed in Venice because he had been ordered to detain Brooks, as the Provost (Consortium head) had allied with Sinskey, with Brooks realizing and punching him in his damaged ribs. Tomb of Enrico Dandolo, at the Hagia Sophia Brooks goes rogue and The Consortium realizes she was a secret supporter and lover of Zobrist. She learned where the plague was being kept after Langdon solved the riddle and acquires a private jet to get to it before everyone else. Langdon, the WHO and The Consortium team up to stop her. After watching Zobrist's video, they conclude that the bag containing the plague will be fully dissolved by the date the video specifies and that Zobrist's clues point to its location: the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, where Enrico Dandolo is buried. He and the others find the plague is in the Cistern but discover that she is already there. The bag that held the plague had already been broken, presumably spreading through the outer world via visiting tourists. Brooks runs out of the Cistern yelling something in Turkish, which causes panic among the tourists who stampede out into the city while Langdon gives chase. Inside Basilica Cistern, with water below and tourists above It is discovered Brooks didn't puncture the bag; it was water-soluble and had dissolved one week earlier in the cistern waters, meaning that the whole world has already been infected. The date specified in Zobrist's video was the mathematical calculation of when the entire world would be infected. It is also discovered that she was trying to stop the virus herself, but didn't trust the WHO because samples of the virus would certainly find their way into the hands of governments performing weapons research. The leader of The Consortium tries to escape WHO custody with help from disguised underlings but is caught later by Turkish police. She receives amnesty in exchange for working with the WHO to address the crisis, since she is a medical doctor and has extensive knowledge of Zobrist's research and work. The plague that Zobrist created is revealed to be a vector virus that randomly activates to employ DNA modification to cause sterility in one third of humans, thereby reducing population growth to a more stable level. Sinskey and Brooks decide not to try to reverse Zobrist's actions, Brooks pointing out that doing so would be difficult and hazardous even for someone like Zobrist and Sinskey acknowledging that Zobrist had a point about the dangers of overpopulation.

She was a loyal disciple of Zobrist until she reads his last letter and decides to get his new technology before it can fall into the wrong hands. She believes the World Health Organization will cooperate with other government agencies to use Zobrist's new virus for weapons. She uses The Consortium and Langdon to follow the Map of Hell and get to ground zero before everyone else, but realizes that Zobrist had set off a futile search as he released his virus well beforehand. *Bertrand Zobrist: A transhumanist genius scientist who is obsessed with Dante's Inferno and a primary antagonist of titular novel.

Marketing Brown released the book's title on his website on January 15, 2013, after prompting readers to help reveal a digital mosaic using social media posts, and revealed the cover in late February 2013. The cover depicts the famous Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore located in Florence, Italy. He also published the first chapter of Inferno along with a free ebook of The Da Vinci Code on March 17. The ebook was distributed for free to readers worldwide through online e-book stores like Amazon, Google Play and Barnes & Noble until March 24, 2013.

Inferno has been translated into French, Russian, Turkish, Greek, German, Dutch, Spanish, Catalan, Italian, Czech, Portuguese, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish and Danish for simultaneous release. The publishers hired a team of 11 translators who worked on the project at the headquarters of Mondadori in Milan between February and April 2013. They were reportedly sequestered in a basement, and worked intensively under strict security and secrecy. It has been also translated into Persian by Afraz Publication, 3 months after first publishing.Walker, Tim (7 May 2013) \\"Real Inferno for Dan Brown translators who toil in underground bunker to decode his latest book\\". The Independent The book was translated into Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian and Azerbaijani and released simultaneously in January 2014. Film Sony Pictures announced a film adaptation would be released on October 14, 2016, with Ron Howard as director, David Koepp adapting the screenplay and Tom Hanks reprising his role as Robert Langdon. On December 2, 2014, Felicity Jones was set to star in the film as Sienna Brooks. Indian actor Irrfan Khan was cast as The Provost. Danish actress Sidse Babett Knudsen was added to the cast as Elizabeth Sinskey. Filming began on April 27, 2015, in Venice, Italy, and wrapped up on July 21, 2015. The first half of film is mostly faithful to the novel, deviating significantly toward the end, specifically that Langdon and his team arrive at the baths in time to prevent the release of the virus rather than arriving a week after it was deployed. Reception=Criticism= The novel received backlash from Filipinos after a female character named Sienna Brooks, who narrated through her flashbacks how she was raped in a Manila slum after volunteering in a humanitarian mission in the Philippines, described the capital as \\"the gates of hell\\". Several authorities expressed their disappointment over the grim and graphic representation of the city, in particular then Metropolitan Manila Development Authority chairman Francis Tolentino through a letter of protest sent to the author. =Critical= Inferno received mixed reviews from critics. The New York Times praised the book as being \\"jampacked with tricks\\" and said that Langdon is on \\"one of those book-length scavenger hunts that Mr. Brown creates so energetically.\\" The New York Daily News reviewed the book favorably, calling it a book of \\"harrowing fun threaded with coded messages, art history, science, and imminent doom.\\" Other reviews were more negative. James Kidd of The Independent panned Brown's awkward prose but expressed approval of the book's plot, writing: \\"Brown's fusion of gothic hyperbole with a pedant's tour-guide deliberately restrains the imagination through its awkward awfulness.\\" The Boston Globe's Chuck Leddy compared the book favorably to Brown's previous works, and deemed it \\"the kind of satisfying escapist read that summers were made for.\\" Samra Amir of The Express Tribune was critical of the novel's predictability and malapropism, but noted that \\"Brown‚Äôs art reigns over boredom. He manages to keep the reader glued.\\" Writing for The Guardian, Peter Conrad dismissed the book's content as \\"conspiratorial farrago\\" and further elaborated: \\"Inferno is also dreadful, abounding in malapropisms and solecisms, leaden restatements of the obvious and naive disinformation about the reality outside the bat-thronged belfry that is Brown's head.\\" =Commercial= Inferno initially sold 369,000 copies at outlets that report to Nielsen BookScan. It debuted as the #1 bestselling book in the US and was also atop the UK's book charts in its first week in shops, selling 228,961 copies. The book remained #1 on Nielsen BookScan for the week ending May 26, selling 211,000 copies and bringing its two-week total to 580,000.

After the promulgation of the constitution of Kenya in 2010, the general public, through parliament, sought to reform the judiciary. Parliament passed the Magistrates and Judges Vetting Act of 2011. A major part of reforming the judiciary was the vetting of Magistrates and Judges in an attempt to weed out unsuitable ones. The Judicature Act has also been amended to raise the minimum number of Magistrates and Judges allowing more judicial officers to be hired. More magistrates and judges are needed to clear the backlog of cases that have caused great delay in the conclusion of cases and to staff new courts. New courts are needed to bring the courts closer to the people which is in line with devolution, a major principle written into the Constitution of 2010. New courts like the High Court opened in Garissa in November 2014 is a good example. In the past residents of North Eastern Kenya had to go all the way to Embu to access a High Court. Courts The Judiciary of Kenya consists of five Superior courts made up of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, High Court, Industrial Court, Environment and Land Court. The subordinate courts consist of the Magistrate Court, Courts Martial and Kadhi Court. According to the Kenyan constitution, the judiciary is the main actor when it comes to solving primary disputes, including more serious ones such as heinous crime. The main mission is the establishment of peace in society through law and order. =Supreme Court of Kenya= The Supreme Court is the highest court in Kenya, and all other courts are bound by its decisions. It was established under Article 163 of the Constitution as the final arbiter and interpreter of the Constitution. It comprises the Chief Justice of Kenya, David Maraga, who is the President of the Court, the Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu, who is the Vice-President of the Court and five other Judges. It sits at the Supreme Court Building (formerly the Court of Appeal in Nairobi Central Business District), and has to have a quorum of five judges. =Court of Appeal= This court handles appeal cases from the High Court and as prescribed by Parliament. It will constitute no less than 12 judges and will be headed by a President elected by the Court of Appeal judges among themselves. The current President of the Court of Appeal is Justice William Ouko. Each station of the court is led by a Principal Judge. =High Court= The High Court of Kenya is established under Article 165 of the constitution of Kenya. It has supervisory jurisdiction over all other subordinate courts and any other persons, body or authority exercising a judicial or quasi- judicial function. The judges responsible elect one of them to act as the topmost principal judge in the court system. It has unlimited original jurisdiction and carries out supervisory roles. =Employment & Labour Relations Court (formerly the Industrial Court)= Established under Article 162(2)(a) of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 as well as The Employment & Labour Relations Act of 2011 - An Act of Parliament to establish the Employment and Labour Relations Court to hear and determine disputes relating to employment and labour relations and for connected purposes. Any disputes relating to employments is preliminarily held at this court, and any further proceedings are taken to the High Court if the case is not determined to conscience of the complainant. =Environment and Land Court= An Act of Parliament to give effect to Article 162(2)(b) of the Constitution; to establish a superior court to hear and determine disputes relating to the environment and the use and occupation of, and title to, land, and to make provision for its jurisdiction functions and powers, and for connected purposes =Subordinate Courts= The courts below the High Court are referred to as Subordinate courts. These are: The Magistrate Court Article 169 1(a) of the constitution of Kenya 2010 creates the Magistrate court. This is where majority of the judiciaries cases are heard. Magistrate courts are generally located in every district in Kenya. The new Magistrate Courts' Act 2015 significantly increases the pecuniary jurisdiction of magistrate courts. One of the most notable changes in terms of the expansion of the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Courts is with regard to the increase of the pecuniary jurisdiction in relation to proceedings of a civil nature. For instance, the pecuniary jurisdiction where the Court is presided over by a chief magistrate has been increased from KES 7 million to KES 20 million shillings. The Chief Justice is however empowered to revise the pecuniary limits of the civil jurisdiction by a Gazette notice, by taking into account inflation and prevailing economic conditions. The presiding judicial officer in Magistrate court could be a Chief Magistrate, Senior Principal Magistrate, Senior Resident Magistrate, Resident Magistrate or Principle Magistrate. Their authorities vary in administrative responsibility and range of fining and sentencing abilities. The Judicature Act is the statute passed by parliament detailing the varying powers and jurisdiction of Magistrates and Judges. Kadhi's Court Article 169 1(b) of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 creates Kadhi's court. This is a court that hears civil matters relating to Sharia law. The parties involved must all be followers of Islam and all must agree that the matter to be decided under Islamic law. The matter must be civil in nature e.g. Divorce, succession etc. The court is headed by a Chief Kadhi and parliament is given the authority to enact laws describing the guidelines, qualification and jurisdiction of this court. Appeals from Kadhi Court are heard by the High Court.  Martial Courts  Article 169 1(c) of the constitution of Kenya 2010 creates the Martial courts. Generally, this type of jurisdiction involves a group of law administrators, that is, the military court where matters involving members of the Kenya Defense Forces are heard. Appeals from this court are heard by the High Court. = Core Values = The judiciary is guided by the following core values: # Professionalism # Integrity # Diligence # Team work # Courage # Humility Administration within the Judiciary The Judiciary The chief administrator of the Supreme Court is the Chief Justice, who is the President of the Supreme Court. One of his/her responsibilities is to come up with procedures for running the courts, as well as decisions on staffing and where new courts should be opened. Certain situations dictate that the Chief Justice appoint a judge or panel of judges to deal with a specific matter. The Deputy Chief Justice is the deputy president of the Supreme Court. The judges of the High Court and the Court of Appeal each elect a member to deal with administrative issues as well as represent them in the Judicial Service Commission. The Chief Registrar of the Supreme Court has the responsibility of being the chief administrator and accounting officer of the Judiciary. The Court of Appeal, High Court and Magistrate Court all have a Registrar to serve as administrator, record keeper and accounting officer in each of the courts. Judicial Service Commission An independent Judicial Service Commission has been set up to handle the appointment of judges. They will recommend a list of persons to be appointed as judges by the President. Chief Justice The Chief Justice of Kenya is the head of the Judiciary and President of the Supreme Court. He or she is appointed by the country's President on the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission and subject to the approval of the National Assembly. The current Chief Justice is David Kenani Maraga.  Controversies  In Northern Kenya, where there are numerous disputes regarding the ownership of the arid land - there is more trust in locally fining and compensating victims for the actions of their perpetrators. Villagers find securing justice outside the justice system more satisfying - as they are able to vindicate an entire social group as opposed to the accused individual. This restoration of order at the social level is seemingly hard to achieve through the regular judicial system. Other barriers such as large geographical distances to courts, long waiting times, increased fees, and lack of private and not for profit attorneys also compound this issue. However, when dealing with issues and grievances against government, these informal conflict resolution methods do not suffice - the people then turn to the judiciary. This dual-judicial system, one official and one quasi, exists because there remains a dissonance between socio-cultural groups and the larger laws applied to the entire country. = Effectiveness and Reform = According to the Governance, Justice, Law and Order Sector reform program - only 3% of the Kenyan population file their cases at court, and 7% do so through police reporting. The remaining 48% resort to chiefs or assistant chiefs (part of the executive) and 25% to traditional 'elders'. In terms of incorporating international law into municipal law, Kenya, like many other countries, has struggled to effectively consolidate legal mechanisms to universally apply across the entire country.  Change Management  Research indicates that change in the judiciary of Kenya has been slow and no serious attempts for reform have been made since 1998. Moreover, employees are often kept in the dark about changes and their input is not really taken into consideration. Further studies show that in order to enhance professionalism, procurement codes must be followed, with regular training provided to staff and clear and structured timelines. Additionally, the influence and power of the executive over the judiciary reigns supreme. Although the Constitution of Kenya 2010 has taken strides to address the undue influence of authority in what should ideally be an independent judicial system - there remains many loopholes by which executive intrusion and control present themselves as evident. Some recommendations to prevent this from occurring are involving key stakeholders of the judiciary in the decision-making process and allowing them to conduct a cost-benefit analysis whenever appropriate. The judiciary should also have a well-established policy regarding executive interference as it moves into the future. The case for an independent Judiciary is thus not only valid, but even highly looked upon in order to fulfill the mission of upholding the peace in society via equal application of law and order. Since the appointment method of judges and magistrates is based on the Judicial Service Commission, it is hard to not have partisan influence.  Collaboration with the International Development Law Organization  With the motto of being \\"robustly Independent, bu constructively interdependent\\" the three different branches of government in Kenya, spearheaded by the Judiciary, came together in 2018 to create the State of the Judiciary and Administration of Justice Annual Report (SOJAR). The report delves into the major reforms conducted by the judiciary since 2010, including but not limited to the access to justice for women and marginalized groups.

The judges in lower courts below the level of HC are appointed by respective HC Collegium. SC and all HCs have their own separate collegium. Each collegium is composed of five people, including the Chief Justice of the relevant court who is also the head of collegium, and four senior most judges of that court. In this system of checks and balance, which ensures the independence of senior judiciary in India, the SC or HC collegium selects and recommends to Chief Justice of India (CJI) the names of judges to be appointed or transferred. CJI has the authority to reject or approve the recommended names. The names approved by the CJI are sent to the Government of India (GoI). GoI's role is restricted to undertaking character verification and national security clearance by the Intelligence Bureau (IB), or raising any objections and clarifications to CJI. If CJI ignores the objections by the GoI, and the same name is sent again to the GoI by the collegium after the re-approval by CJI, then GoI is legally bound to accept the name for the appointment or transfer. GoI sends the approved names to President of India who issues a warrant of appointment (authorisation). Finally, the GoI publishes a notice in weekly The Gazette of India. After this notification the order of appointment comes into legal effect.SC won‚Äôt review 1993 order that set up ‚Äòcollegium system‚Äô. What is it?, Indian Express, 7 November 2019.

What is it?, Indian Express, 7 November 2019. This closed door system with no published rules or eligibility criteria, no oversight by the parliament or the executive, and without independent review or appeal process, has been criticised for the lack of transparency, where often the lawyers aspiring to be appointed have no idea if their name was considered by the collegium or not.

Ramana (Judge) * Rohinton Fali Nariman (Judge) * Uday Umesh Lalit (Judge) * Ajay Manikrao Khanwilkar (Judge) Current collegium system=History of \\"Three Judges Cases\\"= Following are the three cases: # S. P. Gupta v. Union of India - 1982 (also known as the Judges' Transfer case) # Supreme Court Advocates-on Record Association vs Union of India - 1993 # In re Special Reference 1 of 1998 Over the course of the three different cases brought to the supreme court of India, the court evolved the principle of judicial independence to mean that no other branch of the state - including the legislature and the executive - would have any say in the appointment of judges. The court then created the collegium system, which has been in use since the judgment in the Second Judges Case was issued in 1993. There is no mention of the collegium either in the original Constitution of India or in successive amendments. Although the creation of the collegium system was viewed as controversial by legal scholars and jurists outside India, the Parliament and the executive, both have done little to replace it. The Third Judges Case of 1998 is not a case but an opinion delivered by the Supreme Court of India responding to a question of law regarding the collegium system, raised by then President of India K. R. Narayanan, in July 1998 under his constitutional powers. Further, in January 2013, the court dismissed as without locus standi, a public interest litigation filed by NGO Suraz India Trust that sought to challenge the collegium system of appointment. In July 2013, Chief Justice of India P. Sathasivam spoke against any attempts to change the collegium system. On 5 September 2013, the Rajya Sabha passed The Constitution(120th Amendment) bill, 2013, that amends articles 124(2) and 217(1) of the Constitution of India, 1950 and establishes the National Judicial Appointments Commission, on whose recommendation the President would appoint judges to the higher judiciary. The amendment was struck down by the Supreme Court for being unconstitutional on 16 October, 2015. The constitutional bench of Justices J. S. Khehar, Madan Lokur, Kurian Joseph and Adarsh Kumar Goel had declared the 99th Amendment and NJAC Act unconstitutional while Justice Chelameswar upheld it. =Constitutional validity= The SC has upheld the legal validity of the current collegium system, and the Constitution of India has the following two Articles related to this issue: Article 124(2): \\"Every Judge of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with such of the Judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts in the States as the President may deem necessary for the purpose and shall hold office until he attains the age of sixty-five years. Provided that in the case of appointment of a Judge other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of India shall always be consulted.\\" And Article 217: :Every Judge of a High Court shall be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with the Chief Justice of India, the Governor of the State, and, in the case of appointment of a Judge other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of the High Court.: =Judicial meaning of the word \\"Recommendation\\"= In judgement on the presidential reference, Supreme Court has dealt elaborately, the modality of rendering recommendation by a constitutional entity such as Supreme Court, President of India, etc, It is not at the discretion of the person consulted to render the recommendation but internal consultations with the peers shall be made in writing and the recommendation shall be made in accordance with the internal consultations. Failed attempts at reforming and replacing the collegium system=National Judicial Appointments Commission established= The Lok Sabha on 13 August 2014 and the Rajya Sabha on 14 August 2014 passed the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Bill, 2014 to scrap the collegium system of appointment of Judges. The President of India has given his assent to the National Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, 2014 on 31 December 2014, after which the bill has been renamed as the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014. =99th Amendment and NJAC Act quashed by Supreme court= By a majority opinion of 4:1, on 16 October 2015, Supreme Court struck down the constitutional amendment and the NJAC Act restoring the two-decade old collegium system of judges appointing judges in higher judiciary. Supreme Court declared that NJAC is interfering with the autonomy of the judiciary by the executive which amounts to tampering of the basic structure of the constitution where parliament is not empowered to change the basic structure. However Supreme Court has acknowledged that the collegium system of judges appointing judges is lacking transparency and credibility which would be rectified/improved by the Judiciary.

It was built by Ahmad Shah I in 1411. With its well carved royal palaces, mosques, gates and open spaces, it was renovated in 2014 by Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as a cultural centre for the city. Etymology It is believed the fort adopted the name Bhadra after a temple of Bhadra Kali, a form of Laxmi which was established during Maratha rule but a plaque near fort tells a different story: The Bhadra Gate - C.A.D. 1411 - The massive fortified gate was built in or about 1411 to serve as the principal eastern entrance of the palace erected here by Sultan Ahmad Shah I (1411-1442), the founder of Ahmedabad. The palace called the Bhadra after the ancient Rajput citadel of that name at Anhilwada- Patan (Baroda State), which the first three kings of the dynasty of Gujarat Sultans had held before Ahmedabad became the capital. Three inscribed slabs on the walls connecting this gateway with two ancillary gates behind are now almost completely defaced. One of these appears to show a date of the time of Jahangir (1605-1627). History Ahmedabad was named after Ahmad Shah I of the Muzaffarid dynasty. He established Ahmedabad as the new capital of Gujarat Sultanate and built Bhadra Fort on the east bank of the Sabarmati river. It was also known as Arak Fort as described in Mirat-i-Ahmadi. The foundation stone of fort was laid down at Manek Burj in 1411. Square in form, enclosing an area of about forty-three acres, and containing 162 houses, the Bhadra fort had eight gates, three large, two in the east and one in the south-west corner; three middle-sized, two in the north and one in the south; and two small, in the west. The area within the fort had become occupied by urban developments by 1525. So a second fortification was built later by Mahmud Begada, the grandson of Ahmed Shah, with an outer wall 10 km (6.2 mi) in circumference and consisting of 12 gates, 189 bastions and over 6,000 battlements as described in Mirat-i-Ahmadi. Almost 60 governors ruled Gujarat during the Mughal period including the future Mughal emperors Jahangir, Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb. A seraglio was built later in the 17th century by a Mughal governor, Azam Khan, known as Azam Khan Sarai. It was used as a Musafir khana (a resting place for travellers) during Mughal rule. Sarsenapati Umabaisaheb Khanderao Dabhade became the only female Commander-in-Chief in the history of the Marathas in 1732. She commanded the Maratha Army and fought a war near Ahmedabad at Bhadra Fort defeating Mughal Sardar Joravar Khan Babi. Joint rule by Peshwa and Gaekwad of the Maratha Empire brought an end to the Mughal era in 1783. During the First Anglo‚ÄìMaratha War (1775‚Äì1782), General Thomas Wyndham Goddard with 6,000 troops stormed Bhadra Fort and captured Ahmedabad on 15 February 1779. There was a garrison of 6,000 Arab and Sindhi infantry and 2,000 horses. Losses in the fight totalled 108, including two Britons. After the war, the fort was later handed back to Marathas under the Treaty of Salbai. Ahmedabad was conquered by the British in 1817. The fort complex was used as a prison during the British Raj. Azam Khan sarai currently houses the government offices, an ASI office, a post office and the city's civil courts. It is also used for flag hoisting on Independence Day and Republic Day. Structures Bhadra and other structures in old Ahmedabad, 1879 =Citadel, royal square and Teen Darwaza= 300px Bhadra Fort housed royal palaces and the beautiful Nagina Baugh and the royal Ahmed Shah's Mosque on the west side and an open area known as Maidan-Shah on the east side. It had a fortified city wall with 14 towers, eight gates and two large openings covering an area of 43 acres. The eastern wall on the river bank can still be seen. The fort complex was used as a royal court during his reign. On the eastern side of a fort, there is a triple gateway known as Teen Darwaza which was formerly an entrance to the royal square, Maidan-Shah. The road beyond Teen Darwaza leads Manek Chowk, a mercantile square. On the south side along the road, there is a congregational mosque known as Jami Masjid. The citadel's architecture is Indo-sarcenic with intricately carved arches and balconies. Fine latticework adorns windows and murals. There are some Islamic inscriptions on the arches of the fort. The palace contains royal suites, the imperial court, halls, and a prison. =Azam Khan Sarai= Azam Khan Sarai in 1866 when it was used as jail Azam Khan, also known as Mir Muhammad Baquir was a Mughal governor. He built a palace known as Azam Khan Sarai in 1637. Its entrance, 5.49 meters high, opens onto an octagonal hall which had a low balcony made up of stone in the upper floor. It was used as a resting place for travellers in the Mughal era and as a hospital and a jail during British rule. There was a gibbet on the roof of Azam Khan Sarai used for hanging during the Gujarat Sultanate and the British era. According to one story, it was here Ahmed Shah hanged his son-in-law who was convicted of murder. =Bhadra Kali Temple= A room in north wing of Azam Khan Sarai was turned into the temple of Bhadra Kali during Maratha rule. It has a black statue of Goddess Bhadra Kali with four hands. ;Legend Years ago, Laxmi, the Goddess of Wealth, came to the gate of Bhadra Fort to leave the city in the night. Watchman Siddique Kotwal stopped her and identified her. He asked her not to leave fort until he obtained permission from the king. He beheaded himself in order to keep Laxmi in the city. It resulted in the prosperity of the city. There is a tomb near Bhadra Gate dedicated to Siddique Kotwal and a temple to Bhadra Kali, representing Laxmi. A lamp in one of the hole in Teen Darwaza is lit continuously for more than six hundred years by a Muslim family is dedicated to Laxmi. =Clock tower= Bhadra fort clock tower The Bhadra Fort tower clock was brought from London in 1849 at cost of Rs. 8000 and installed here at the cost of ¬£243 (Rs. 2430) in 1878 by the British East India Company. At night, it was illuminated from behind by a kerosene lamp which was replaced by an electric light in 1915. Ahmedabad's first electrical connection, it ceased to operate in the 1960s but the AMC and the ASI now plan to repair it. Redevelopment Bhadra Fort from inside and tower clock after renovation Under Bhadra Plaza Development Project, an initiative of the AMC and the ASI, Bhadra Fort was renovated and the open space between the fort and Teen Darwaza, earlier known as Maidan-Shah was restored. Landscaping was recreated based on the accounts of historical past travellers. The work started on 26 January 2012 and the renovation of open areas was completed in November 2014. The cost of the project is estimated Rs 115 crore. A stretch between the fort and Teen Darwaza earlier known as Maidan-Shah was declared a pedestrian zone. The new public amenities, marble benches and kiosks for hawkers were constructed. There are also plans for a pedestrian bridge connecting Bhadra plaza with the Sabarmati riverfront and a multilevel car park at Lal Darwaza. The museum and galleries are planned on the first floor of the fort palace while a handicraft outlet will be housed on the ground floor. A traditional restaurant, food and ethnic markets as well as an exhibition centre are also planned. It is the first heritage and pedestrianization project under JnNURM. Jaishankar Sundari hall, a performing arts venue, was renovated and reopened in 2010. The city civil court and sessions court were operated in buildings adjacent to Azam Khan Sarai. They were transferred to old high court building on Ashram Road. The new eight-floor court building is planned after demolition of old buildings. The plan was challenged in Gujarat High Court citing protected monument laws and regulations but high court permitted the construction after presentation by authorities. =Recognition= * HUDCO Award for Best Practices to Improve the Living Environment 2013 Gallery Image:Bhadra fort inscription.JPGBhadra Fort inscription Image:Bhadra fort gate from inside.JPGBhadra fort gate from inside Image:Chinubhai Ranchhodlal.JPGStatue of Chinubhai Baronet in Royal Square Image:Teen Darwaza.JPGRoadside vendors at Teen Darwaza See also * Ahmedabad * History of Ahmedabad * Gates of Ahmedabad * Teen Darwaza * Manek Chowk * Jami Mosque * Kankaria Lake References * This article contains public domain text from External links * Bhadra Fort Development Project * Photo Gallery Category:Buildings and structures in Ahmedabad Category:Forts in Gujarat Category:Tourist attractions in Ahmedabad ","title":"Bhadra Fort"},{"id":"38237574","text":"Nasirabad (, also Romanized as Na≈üƒ´rƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Hakimabad Rural District, in the Central District of Zarandieh County, Markazi Province, Iran.

Relative poverty was also in decline until the late 1990s, but has risen since then. While only about 2% of South Koreans are affected by absolute poverty today, about 14-15% of these 2% are elderly and are affected by relative poverty. Trends The poverty rate of elderly people in South Korea is the highest among the OECD countries Poverty rate in South Korea (age 65+) in 2011 Choo, Park and Yoon noted that both absolute and relative poverty have declined in Korea from 1965 to 1990. They concluded that \\"rapid economic growth during [the analyzed period of 1960s-1980s] in Korea has alleviated poverty to a great extent\\". Philips et al. praised South Korea, noting that \\"South Korea has experienced one of the most dramatic declines in absolute poverty that the world has seen\\". They added that while over half of the Korean population was affected by absolute poverty in mid-1950s, absolute poverty had declined to only about 3.4 percent of the population by the mid-1990s. As of 2001, absolute poverty was below 2% (however, another estimate for 2000 cited 11.5%). However, more recent data suggests that relative poverty has been on the rise, growing from about 8% in the early 1990s to 15% as of 2012. According to official estimates, about 15% of South Koreans live below the poverty line. Poverty in South Korea is defined as relative poverty. It is important to note that relative poverty is not the same as absolute poverty: relative poverty measures the share of the population living on less than half of the median income. (Median income in South Korea in 2007 was $19,179 (W20m).) About half of all citizens over the age of 65 are living in poverty, one of the highest rates among OECD countries. In the last 15 years, the number of adults caring for their parents has declined from 90% to 37%. Poverty among Korean elderly In the rapidly aging demographics in South Korea, many elderly require healthcare. Studies taken across many demographics concluded that South Korean elderly with low income lack proper social protection from the government and are the most disadvantaged. In recent years ‚Äúthe proportion of aged 65 and older among people with disabilities has quickly increased, from 30.3% to 43.3% in 2014‚Äù. That makes South Korea the leader in this aspect as 3 times the growth as compared to the international average. 26 percent of Korean elderly lived in poverty in 2008. Among OECD countries, the poverty risk is significantly higher for South Korea's elderly. While the number of elders living in poverty increases every year for many countries, South Korea remains with the highest poverty rate of people aged over 65 among the OECD countries.Youn, H. M., Lee, H. J., Lee, D. W., & Park, E. C. (2020). The impact of poverty transitions on frailty among older adults in South Korea: findings from the Korean longitudinal study of ageing. BMC geriatrics, 20(1), 139. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-020-01522-x Moreover, the poverty risk is particularly high for the South Korean elderly who are less educated, living alone, living in a rural area, or are not in good health. Many low-income elderly individuals are currently living with their children, which are often providing them with financial aid, and many also depend on welfare transfers. Reasons for poverty OECD listed several factors among the reasons for poverty in Korea. First, public social spending in South Korea is low. Social spending by the government in South Korea was 7.6% of GDP in 2007, compared to the OECD average of 19%. This can be explained by the Korean traditional reliance on family and the private sector to provide such services. Second, Korea's dualistic labour market, in which a significant number of workers are hired only on temporary contracts with low wages and benefits, results in high inequality in wage income. Income inequality South Korea, along with many other East Asian countries, has been known for very equal distribution of income and wealth. However, this has been changing over the last couple decades. Statistics show that in the 1990s, income equality reached a peak and has declined since then. This may be in part due to the country's rapid economic growth. In a now more competitive job market, the head of the household or householder is expected to be more educated, which makes it hard for rural families to compete with a lack of access to higher education, subsequently resulting in income inequality between urban and rural areas. Some attribute income inequality to a change in traditional household head dynamics in South Korea. An increase in single headed households and a stiflingly low access to new jobs has created a financially challenging situations for many families in South Korea, leading many not to have families at all. Welfare state South Korea has a seemingly brutal take on welfare and trade unions. Many trade unions and the opposition groups they represent have been shut down by the government. It was only within the last decade that a social security has been set up for the elderly, but many elderly still live in extreme poverty despite help from the government. South Korea has a comprehensive national healthcare for all of its citizens.

A specialist sprinter, he won his first three races (including the New Stakes by wide margins before his two-year-old season was curtailed by injury. In 1961 he was beaten in his first two races before returning to his best to win the King George Stakes and Nunthorpe Stakes. He was retired to stud at the end of the season and had mixed success as a sire of winners. Background Floribunda was a dark-coated bay horse with no white markings, bred in Britain by his owner Meg Mullion. Mullion, who owned the Ardenode Stud in partnership with her husband Jim, sent the colt to Ireland to be trained at the Curragh, County Kildare, by Paddy Prendergast, a trainer noted for his handling of precocious two-year-olds. His sire Princely Gift was a leading sprinter who broke the track record at Doncaster Racecourse when carrying 130 pounds in the 1955 Portland Handicap. Floribunda's dam Astrentia also produced his full sister Kew, the great-grand-dam of the Prix de Diane winner Sil Sila. Racing career=1960: two-year-old season= Floribunda began his racing career in Ireland in spring, winning a maiden race at the Curragh Racecourse by twelve lengths. On his next appearance he set a new track record when winning over five furlongs at Phoenix Park. Predergast sent the colt to England in June for the New Stakes, one of the most important two-year-old races at Royal Ascot. Ridden by the Australian jockey Ron Hutchinson he started the 2/7 favourite and won by eight lengths. His \\"runaway\\" win led to him being described as the best two-year-old of the season up to that point. Floribunda returned to England in August when he was stepped up to six furlongs in the Gimcrack Stakes at York. He sustained an injury in the race and finished third behind Test Case. He did not run again that season. =1961: three-year-old season= On his first appearance as a three-year-old, Floribunda was tried over seven furlongs in the Tetrarch Stakes at the Curragh, but failed to stay the distance and finished unplaced behind Time Greine. Floribunda returned to sprinting at Royal Ascot in June and showed better form, without looking likely to win, when finishing second to Silver Tor in the King's Stand Stakes. In July Floribunda returned to England for the King George Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. Despite having sustained three consecutive defeats he was made 4/6 favourite and won decisively from the filly Cynara with the previous season's leading sprinter Bleep-Bleep in third place. Floribunda's best performance came at York in August when he was ridden by Hutchinson in the Nunthorpe Stakes. He won \\"in brilliant style\\" by four lengths from Cynara and Silver Tor. According to John Randall, writing in the Racing Post, the performance established Floribunda as \\"Ireland's greatest sprinter\\". It was expected that Floribunda would run in the Prix de l'Abbaye at Longchamp in October and then stay in training as a four-year-old, but he never ran again and was retired to stud. Assessment The independent Timeform organisation rated Floribunda the best two-year-old of 1960 with a rating of 135. The official Free Handicap, however, was topped by the filly Opaline. In the following season, Floribunda improved his Timeform rating to 136, making him the second highest-rated horse in Europe behind the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Molvedo. In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Floribunda the best British or Irish-trained horse of his generation. He was also rated the thirteenth-best British or Irish-trained sprinter and the sixteenth-best Irish racehorse of the 20th century. Stud career Floribunda retired to stand as a stallion at his owners Ardenode Stud. He had moderate results, the best of his offspring being Princely Son (Haydock Sprint Cup) and Porto Bello (New Stakes). He was sold and exported to Japan where he died 30 September 1979.

Founded in 1947, it offers associate and bachelor's degrees. History Stevens ‚Äì The Institute of Business & Arts got its start in 1947 as the St. Louis affiliate of Patricia Stevens, a modeling and ‚Äúfinishing‚Äù school for young women. Patricia Stevens herself was a working fashion model, and there were many schools bearing her name around the country, but the one in St. Louis was operated by the Klute family. In addition to modeling and comportment classes, young women could also take courses that would aid in them in the post-WWII work world ‚Äì think secretarial skills. Over the years, Patricia Stevens‚Äô catalog of offerings expanded to include not just short-term certificate and diploma programs, but also Associates and bachelor's degrees. The school's longest-running programs, which are still among its most popular, are the Retail Management/Fashion Merchandising and the Interior Design programs. One other major change to this once-all-girls college was the addition of men. The school now functions as a completely co-educational environment. Campus In 2010, the school moved to its new, permanent location on Washington Avenue in the city's revitalized garment district. The building, originally built in 1917 for the George E Keith shoe factory underwent a $3 million renovation. The 24,000+ square foot campus is located at 1521 Washington Avenue and situated in the heart of the St. Louis Loft district, within walking distance of attractions such as the City Museum, the main branch of the St. Louis Public Library, St. Louis University Law Library, and numerous parks, coffee shops, boutiques, and restaurants. The campus is accessible by public transportation, and there are a number of public parking lots close by. The interior of the building was designed specifically for Siba's needs, and provides ample space for instruction, study, and social interaction. Organization and administration Siba is an independent, proprietary institution owned and operated by BGB Associates, LLC, a registered Missouri corporation. The sole shareholder is Cynthia Musterman. The college is organized and authorized to conduct its operation in accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri. Siba works on a rolling admissions system, and all application materials submitted for admission must be on file no later than one week prior to final registration for the beginning of a term. The school runs on a quarterly basis and has enrollments in the Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall.

After passing the ‚Äûmaturita‚Äú he studied medicine in Vienna and finished his studies at the German university in Prague in 1938. From 1938 to 1939 he completed a one-year military service. He worked as a doctor in Pal√∫dzka and Ru≈æomberok. Strauss converted to Catholicism from Judaism after a two-year struggle in 1942. Before the war ended he had been in a concentration camp in Nov√°ky. He subsequently worked as a surgeon in Bratislava and from 1946 to 1956 as a head surgeon in Skalica. Finally, from 1956 to 1982, he worked as a surgeon in the State hospital in Nitra. Strauss spent his childhood and student years in the house of his grandfather, Doctor Bartolomej Kux, who was an educated, however sceptical Jew. Under his influence, young Strauss perceived God more pantheisticly, which gave him a feeling of fear and insecurity. After adolescence he had doubts about the value of the world, in which he saw severe social injustice. He saw many negative traits in a lot of his Jewish fellows, on the other hand the Judaism was enlightened by the example of Hasidic rabbis. At the end of his high school, Strauss was flirting with communism, by studying the work of Mehring, Engels, Lenin, Plechan, and Bukharin. He was under the strong influence of Breton¬¥s and Eluard¬¥s surrealism and poetism and dadaism as well. During his studies in Prague he was going through some enriching cultural experience, which when he looked back at, he thought of them as ‚Äû...as a sticker, a band-aid for a scattered soul. The outer discomfort beyond more restless and sinful soul. The obscurity in moral viewpoints, the desire to stand out and the great hunger after the truth, the purity and the assurance, even besides the notorious social problems...‚Äú Nevertheless, he found something in this all later and considered it as his first phase of the conversion to Christianity. He defined it as a challenge of remplacing himself for living with the others, living for the world, especially the world of future. The second phase of his conversion had started during his military service in Ru≈æomberok, where he was very positively influenced by the converted family - ‚ÄûMunkovci‚Äú. They availed him of catholic literature, particularly the work of Lippert and Guardini. He excitedly read the other work of Maritain, Blondel, Gilson, Guitton, Rilke, Papini, Bergson and others. He could not have let go of the ideas of Nietzsche, Breton and of some published ideas in the magazine Psych√©. In the third phase of Strauss¬¥s conversion, starting in about 1940, he was accepting a challenge to be baptized by Jozef Ko≈æ√°r, which had been consecrating him into the New Testament for almost half a year. Just before the baptism he partook in the spiritual retreats under the guidance of a Jesuit J√°n Die≈°ka and eventually he completed interviews with then Jesuit provincial padre Jozef Miku≈°. In the post conversion phase he strengthened his faith by reading religion literature, particularly Imitation of Christ, Filotey and by penetrating into the liturgical life of the Church. His wife M√°ria, maiden name: Loydlov√° was some kind of a spiritual manuduktor to him.

It began on 6 January 2013, when according to Pakistani reports Indian forces attacked a Pakistani border post, killing one soldier. Indian authorities claimed the incident as a retaliation against preceding Pakistani ceasefire violations, but denied having crossed the demarcation line. In a second skirmish on 8 January, Indian authorities said that Pakistani forces crossed the LoC, killing two Indian soldiers. The incident sparked outrage in India and harsh reactions by the Indian army and government over the news that the body of one of the soldiers had been beheaded. Pakistan denied these reports. On 15 January, a third skirmish reportedly led to the death of another Pakistani soldier. After talks between Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia and Major General Ashfaq Nadeem, an understanding was reached to de-escalate the situation. But the skirmishes continued despite peace efforts by the countries resulting in 8 Indian casualties in total and 9 Pakistani casualties till August. Civilians were also affected adversely by the border skirmishes.

They reported that the Pakistani soldiers took advantage of the foliage and dense fog and opened fire on an area-domination unit of Sector 10, killing two soldiers of 13 Rajputana Rifles and injuring two others. The Sector-10 headquarters in the Mendhar area of Poonch district was operating under the Rajouri-based 25th Division. According to the Indian Army, the skirmish lasted for approximately 30 minutes, after which the intruders retreated from the Indian territory. Two soldiers, Lance Naik Hemraj and Lance Naik Sudhakar Singh, were killed and their bodies were apparently found mutilated, with one decapitated. The bodies were then recovered and the injured soldiers were airlifted and admitted to the Indian Army's Command Hospital.

The men, identified as Zafran Ghulam Sarwar, Shah Zaman, Muhammad Faisal and Wajid Akbar, were killed near the Katwar post according to Indian police documentation. India claimed the men were intruders and militants. This was disputed by Pakistan, according to whom the men were local civilians plucking herbs and had strayed close to the Line of Control when they were abducted by the Indians. Locals and an Indian police official noted that it would be \\"unusual for an infiltrating group of four terrorists to possess only one assault rifle, and no grenades or communication equipment\\" and that at least two of the men were wearing rubber flip-flops. These killings are believed to have sparked off the border skirmishes in early August. =In August= * -On 5 August 2013, some exchanges were reported on the LoC during which Indian Border Security Force head constable Ram Niwas Meena was injured in sniper firing in the Samba district.

Reactions=India= The reaction in India was overwhelmingly one of anger. Then Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that this incident had seriously damaged the ongoing peace process and \\"after this dastardly act, there can‚Äôt be business as usual with Pakistan.\\" Bikram Singh, the Chief of Army Staff of India said that \\"We reserve the right to retaliate at a time of our choosing.\\" Bikram Singh also said,\\"The attack on January 8 was premeditated, a pre- planned activity. Such an operation requires planning, detailed reconnaissance.\\" Then Indian Leader of Opposition, Sushma Swaraj said that \\"If Pakistan does not return the severed head of the martyred soldier Hemraj, India should get at least 10 heads from the other side\\". She also said that the Indian government had to avenge the death of the two soldiers. Protests took place outside the Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi, and the protesters painted Pakistan Murdabad (Death to Pakistan) on its walls. The Indian Army also released the photos of landmines planted by Pakistan in Indian-controlled land, though Pakistan refused to acknowledge any such act. The then Indian Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde alleged on 9 January that the 2008 Mumbai attacks mastermind and Lashkar-e-Toiba founder Hafiz Saeed has visited the Indo-Pakistani border a few days before the Indian soldiers were killed. He cited intelligence obtained by Indian intelligence agencies, and said that they were trying to obtain more details on the visit. However, Saeed rejected the claim, calling it a \\"blatant lie\\" and challenged the Indian government to prove the allegation. He said that India was trying to shift focus from its internal problems and was exploiting the sentiments against Pakistan. =Pakistan= The Pakistan military information sources, the Inter- Services Public Relations (ISPR), rejected the allegation that the incident was unprovoked, calling the Indian presentation of events as \\"propaganda\\" to divert international attention from an earlier incident on 6 January, when a Pakistani soldier was killed by Indian troops in what was claimed by Pakistan as an Indian violation of the Line of Control. Pakistani officials also welcomed an investigation from the UN. The Washington Post quoted an Indian security official admitting that the 8 January incident may have \\"come in retaliation\\" for the 6 January incident in which Indian troops had killed the Pakistani soldier. The Foreign Office of Pakistan stated that it had summoned the Deputy Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad during which a protest note was handed on the \\"unprovoked Indian attack\\" and the Government of India \\"was strongly urged to take appropriate measures to avoid recurrence of such incidents in the future.\\" Earlier in January 2013, Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar said to the media that she was \\"unpleasantly surprised\\" by India's accusations. She further said that \\"Pakistan's government and its people have demonstrated a deep and abiding commitment to normalize and improve relations with India and to really start a journey of trust-building.\\" In an interview with Times Now, former President and chief of army staff General Pervez Musharraf similarly refuted allegations of any Indian soldier being mutilated by the Pakistani military, pointing out that this was not part of army discipline and culture. He also criticised India's tendency of painting \\"us as rogues when you yourself are not prepared to admit all the cruelty that you inflict on us\\" and India's decision of sending back Pakistani artists and hockey players, adding: \\"The politicians, media, everyone in India have a tendency to be hysterical about everything.\\" Responding to the incident to media, senior fleet commander, Vice-Admiral Muhammad Zakaullah quoted that, Pakistan has ability to answer the disturbance of border. Addressing the media representatives at the ISPR directorate, Admiral Zakaullah noted to media that \\"Pakistan forces are prepared for any critical situation.\\" Answering the question of Indian Army's further capabilities, Admiral Zakaullah said that Pakistan was not concerned due to New Delhi's ground capability as it had the ability to defend itself from against any aggression. In August, protestors in Muzaffarabad of Azad Kashmir protested against India's attacks during which they chanted anti-India and pro-Kashmir slogans. In the aftermath of the August incidents, Pakistan considered withdrawing diplomatic staff from its High Commission in New Delhi and redeploying troops positioned on the Afghan border towards the Line of Control. The Provincial Assembly of Punjab passed a unanimous resolution against India's violations of the LoC and expressed concern over the killing of Pakistani soldiers and civilians, in addition to calling on the federal government to raise the issue at international forums. The Parliament of Pakistan adopted a unanimous resolution similarly condemning the incidents and demanded the Pakistan government to take up the issue with India in a \\"forceful but prudent manner\\". Pakistan has also temporarily abandoned talks on the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan‚ÄìPakistan‚ÄìIndia pipeline with India.Tension with New Delhi: Pakistan refuses to take part in talks on TAPI pipeline  International reactions  * ‚Äì French Ambassador to India Fran√ßois Richier condemned the killing of the Indian soldiers, and termed it as an \\"additional element of atrocity\\". * ‚Äì The Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) during a joint statement at its 12th summit in Cairo expressed concern over ceasefire violations along the LoC and welcomed Pakistan's proposal to hold an investigation into the incidents through the United Nations Military Observer Group for India and Pakistan.India must allow fact-finding mission in Kashmir: OIC * ‚Äì Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hong Lei said: \\"As a neighbour and friend of both India and Pakistan, we sincerely hope that the two countries properly and calmly resolve the dispute through dialogue and consultation, so as to maintain peace and stability in South Asia.\\" He further said \\"India and Pakistan are important countries in South Asia\\" * ‚Äì United States State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said that the United States was urging India and Pakistan to \\"de-escalate\\" after the recent clashes and continue high-level consultations to work through their differences. =Effect on India-Pakistan relations= Due to the tensions building between the two nations and as a sign of protest, the Indian Government on 15 January decided to send back the Pakistani hockey players who were in India to participate in the Hockey India League. The Indian government has put on hold a plan to issue visas to Pakistani senior citizens on arrival in India. Though the government sources initially mentioned that the agreement was delayed, a senior home ministry official said that the deal was put on hold for some time. After a brief phone conversation between Indian Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia and his Pakistani counterpart Major General Ashfaq Nadeem, an Indian spokesman told that the Indian Army has reached an understanding with Pakistan to de-escalate the situation. Pakistan's DGMO conveyed that his troops had been ordered to observe the ceasefire at the LoC strictly and exercise restraint. Media coverage=India= In the backdrop of the border incident, Indian television news anchors questioned the peace process and cultural and sporting ties between India and Pakistan. The Indian government spoke of the \\"barbaric and inhuman mutilation\\" of the corpses and denounced the \\"ghastly\\" and \\"dastardly\\" act. Saikat Datta for the Daily News and Analysis suggested that Indian army units in the Uri sector could have provoked the incident. =Pakistan= Ali Ahmed, a freelance journalist who writes for the Express Tribune, wrote that media coverage in Pakistan was not very extensive was partially due to focus being diverted to Pakistan's upcoming general elections ‚Äì which was only weeks away ‚Äì and the fallout of the War in North-West Pakistan.
