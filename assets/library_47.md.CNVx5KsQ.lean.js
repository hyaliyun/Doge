Thus the funding and resourcing of the service is shared and the providing department effectively becomes an internal service provider. The key here is the idea of 'sharing' within an organization or group. This sharing needs to fundamentally include shared accountability of results by the unit from where the work is migrated to the provider. The provider, on the other hand, needs to ensure that the agreed results are delivered based on defined measures (KPIs, cost, quality etc.).  Overview  Shared services is similar to collaboration that might take place between different organizations such as a Hospital Trust or a Police Force. For example, adjacent Trusts might decide to collaborate by merging their HR or IT functions. There are two arguments for sharing services:Why do we believe in economy of scale?. Thesystemsthinkingreview.co.uk. Retrieved on 2013-07-26. The ‚Äòless of a common resource' argument and the ‚Äòefficiency through industrialization' argument. The former is ‚Äòobvious': if you have fewer managers, IT systems, buildings etc; if you use less of some resource, it will reduce costs. The second argument is ‚Äòefficiency through industrialization‚Äô. This argument assumes that efficiencies follow from specialization and standardization ‚Äì resulting in the creation of ‚Äòfront' and ‚Äòback' offices. The typical method is to simplify, standardize and then centralize, using an IT 'solution' as the means. Shared services is different from the model of outsourcing, which is where an external third party is paid to provide a service that was previously internal to the buying organization, typically leading to redundancies and re-organization. There is an ongoing debate about the advantages of shared services over outsourcing.Outsourcing vs. shared services  InfoWorld  Column  2006-05-30  By Ephraim Schwartz Shared Services vs. Outsourcing  IT Business Edge It is sometimes assumed that a joint venture between a government department and a commercial organization is an example of shared services. The joint venture involves the creation of a separate legal commercial entity (jointly owned), which provides profit to its shareholders. Traditionally the development of a shared-service organization (SSO) or shared-service centre (SSC) within an organization is an attempt to reduce costs (often attempted through economies of scale), standardized processes (through centralization). A global Service Center Benchmark studySSON and Hackett Group global Service Center Benchmark study  Shared Services & Outsourcing Network (SSON)  Webinar  2009-03-31  Presented by Penny Weller carried out by the Shared Services & Outsourcing Network (SSON) and the Hackett Group, which surveyed more than 250 companies, found that only about a third of all participants were able to generate cost savings of 20% or greater from their SSOs. At NASA, the 2006 switch to a shared services model is realizing nearly $20 million of savings annually. Further, by the end of 2015, the NASA Shared Services Center is expected to save the organization a total of over $200 million, according to NASA's Director of Service Delivery.Kenneth Newton, ‚ÄúShared Services: Bringing Efficiency from NASA to Higher Education,‚Äù The EvoLLLution, October 17, 2014. Accessed at http://www.evolllution.com/opinions/shared-services-bringing-efficiency-nasa- higher-education/ A large-scale cultural and process transformation can be a key component of a move to shared services and may include redundancies and changes of work practices. It is claimed that transformation often results in a better quality of work life for employees although there are few case studies to back this up . Shared services are more than just centralization or consolidation of similar activities in one location. Shared services can mean running these service activities like a business and delivering services to internal customers at a cost, quality, and timeliness that is competitive with alternatives.  Commercial structures  A shared service can take a variety of different commercial structures. The basic commercial structures include: ; Unitary: A single organization consolidating and centralizing a business service : Lead department: An organization consolidating and centralizing a business service that will be shared by other organizations ; Joint initiatives: Agreement between two or more organizations to set up and operate shared services  Location variations  It is sometimes argued that there are three basic location variations for a shared service including: ; On- shore: Work is carried out in the same country but at a different location ; Near-shore: Work is carried out in a close location (e.g. continental Europe relative to the UK) ; Off-shore: Work is carried out anywhere in the world that is not on-shore or near-shore This is not just to take advantage of wage arbitrage but to appreciate the talents of particular economies in delivering specific service offerings. The difficulty with this argument is that near- shore and off-shore are normally associated with the outsourcing model and are difficult to reconcile with the notion of an internally shared service as distinct from an externally purchased service. Clearly, the use of off-shore facilities by a government department is not an example of shared services.  Benchmarking and measurement  In establishing and running a shared service, benchmarking and measurement is considered by some as a necessity. Benchmarking is the comparison of the service provision usually against best in class. The measurement occurs by using agreed key performance indicators (KPIs). Although the amount of KPIs chosen differs greatly it is generally accepted that fewer than 10 carefully chosen KPIs will deliver the best results. Organizations do attempt to define benchmarks for processes and business operations. Benchmarking can be used to achieve different goals including: 1\\\\. To drive performance improvements using benchmarks as a means for setting performance targets that are met either through incremental performance improvements or transformational change.  Strategic: with a focus on a long-term horizon; and  Tactical: with a focus on the short and medium term 2\\\\. To focus an organization on becoming world class with processes that deliver the highest levels of performance that are better than those of its peer group.  In the private sector  The private sector has been moving towards shared services since the beginning of the 1980s. Large organizations such as the BBC, BP, Bristol Myers Squibb, Ford, GE, HP, Pfizer, Rolls-Royce, ArcelorMittal, and SAP are operating them with great success. According to the English Institute of Chartered Accountants, more than 30% of U.S. Fortune 500 companies have implemented a shared-service center, and are reporting cost savings in their general accounting functions of up to 46%. The conventional accounting practice used to generate these figures is disputed however by management thinker Professor John Seddon, who argues that the measurement known as 'unit cost' tells you nothing about overall costs. Overall costs include 'failure demand', which is defined as a failure to do something or do something right for the customer.  In the public sector  The public sector has taken note of the benefits derived in the private sector and continues to strive for best practice. The United States and Australia among others have had shared services in government since the late 1990s. However, the failures of these projects are increasingly being reported by the pressGovernment shared services navigate a rocky road - Part 1 - shared services, government services division, queensland health.

New trends Organizations that have centralized their IT functions have now begun to take a close look at the technology services that their IT departments provide to internal customers, evaluating where it makes sense to provide specific technology components as a shared service. E-mail and scanning operations were obvious early candidates; many organizations with document-intensive operations are deploying scanning centers as a shared service. Many large organizations, in both the public and private sectors, are now considering deploying enterprise content management (ECM) technology as a shared service.

Coffee (June 2, 1772 ‚Äì July 7, 1833) was an American planter and state militia general in Tennessee. He commanded troops under General Andrew Jackson during the Creek Wars (1813‚Äì14) and during the Battle of New Orleans in the War of 1812. During his presidency, Jackson appointed Coffee as his representative, along with Secretary of War John Eaton, to negotiate treaties with Southeast American Indian tribes to accomplish removal, a policy authorized by Congressional passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830. Coffee negotiated the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek of 1830 with the Choctaw by which they ceded their lands, and started negotiations with the Chickasaw, but they did not conclude a treaty until after his death. Family Born in Prince Edward County, Virginia, Coffee was the son of Captain Joshua Coffee (January 26, 1745 ‚Äì September 8, 1797) and Elizabeth Graves (January 28, 1742 ‚Äì December 13, 1804). His grandfather, Peter Coffee, Sr. was Irish and was probably born around 1705. In 1730 he was released from the Old Bailey and \\"transported\\" to Virginia where he labored as an indentured servant in the tobacco fields for 14 years, gaining his freedom in 1744. Marriage and family John Coffee married Mary Donelson, the daughter of Captain John Donelson III and Mary Purnell, on October 3, 1809. A paternal aunt of Mrs. Coffee was Andrew Jackson's wife, Rachel Donelson Robards. Coffee and Jackson were in business together. Before John Coffee's marriage, Jackson sold his partnership in their joint merchandising business to Coffee, taking promissory notes for the sale. After the wedding, Jackson gave Coffee the notes as his wedding present to the couple. Career Coffee was a merchant and land speculator. He was considered to be the most even-tempered and least selfish of Jackson's lifelong friends. Described as a big awkward man, careless of dress, and slow of speech, Coffee was also said to be kindly, tactful and wise. In early 1806, Coffee challenged Nathaniel A. McNairy to a duel for publishing derogatory statements about Jackson. The duel took place on March 1, 1806, over the Tennessee line in Kentucky. McNairy unintentionally fired before the \\"word\\", wounding Coffee in the thigh. In return, McNairy offered to lay down his pistol and give Coffee an extra shot. The weapons used in this duel were also used in the Jackson-Dickinson duel on May 30, 1806. =Militia service= At the beginning of the War of 1812, Coffee raised the 2nd Regiment of Volunteer Mounted Riflemen, composed mostly of Tennessee militiamen (and a few men from Alabama). In December 1812, Governor Willie Blount had called out the Tennessee militia in response to a request from General James Wilkinson and the U.S. Secretary of War. Under Jackson's command, Coffee led 600 men in January 1813 to Natchez, Mississippi Territory, via the Natchez Trace, in advance of the rest of the rest of the troops, who traveled via flatboats on the major rivers. After the two groups reunited in Natchez, Wilkinson and the U.S. government disbanded Jackson's troops. All marched back to Nashville to disband, and on this march Jackson earned the nickname Old Hickory from his troops. They arrived in Nashville on May 18, 1813. On September 4, 1813, Coffee was involved in the Andrew Jackson-Benton brothers duel in Nashville, knocking Thomas Benton down a flight of stairs after Benton's failed assassination attempt on Jackson.Augustus Buell, History of Andrew Jackson: Pioneer, Patriot, Soldier, Politician and President, Vol. I (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1904), pp. 289‚Äì290. In October 1813, the 2nd Regiment was combined with Colonel Cannon's Mounted Regiment and the 1st Regiment of Volunteer Mounted Gunmen to form a militia brigade of mounted infantry. Coffee was promoted to brigadier-general and placed in command. Coffee led his brigade, which included free blacks and Native American warriors from allied Southeast tribes, at the 1814-15 Battle of New Orleans. They played a key role in holding the woods to the east of the British column. Coffee's brigade was the first to engage the British, by firing from behind the trees and brush. Jackson chose General Coffee as his advance commander in the Creek War (concurrent with the War of 1812), during which he commanded mostly state militia and allied Native Americans. Under Jackson, Coffee led his brigade at the Battle of Tallushatchee, the Battle of Talladega, and the Battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek, where he was seriously wounded; and at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. At the latter, the allied forces conclusively defeated the Red Sticks, traditionalists of the Creek Nation who were allied with the British. Later life After the war and some failed investments, Coffee began work as a surveyor. In 1816 he surveyed the boundary line between Alabama Territory and Mississippi Territory. He later moved to a place near Florence, Alabama. His friend and former business partner Jackson was elected President. Jackson worked toward removal of Southeast Native American tribes to lands west of the Mississippi River. He appointed Coffee as his representative, along with Secretary of War John Eaton, to negotiate treaties which would accomplish removal, a policy authorized by Congressional passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830. Coffee negotiated the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek of 1830 with the Choctaw by which they ceded their Southeastern lands. Coffee started negotiations with the Chickasaw,\\"Levi Colbert to President Andrew Jackson, 22 NOV 1832\\" , Chickasaw Letters  1832, Chickasaw Historical Research Website (Kerry M.

Keith Pratt and Richard Rutt. (Curzon. 1999) page 209. He was a member of the Gyeongju Gim clan. He used various Ho (pen-names): Wandang (ÈòÆÂ†Ç), Chusa (ÁßãÂè≤), Yedang (Á¶ÆÂ†Ç), Siam (Ë©©Â∫µ), Gwapa (ÊûúÂù°), Nogwa (ËÄÅÊûú) etc. (some 200 in all). He is especially celebrated for having transformed Korean epigraphy and for having created the ‚ÄúChusa-che‚Äù (ÁßãÂè≤È´î Chusa writing style) inspired by his study of ancient Korean and Chinese epitaphs. His ink paintings, especially of orchids, are equally admired. As a scholar, he belonged to the Silhak (Practical Learning) school also known as the Bukhak (ÂåóÂ≠∏, ‚ÄúNorthern Learning‚Äù). He was related to Queen Jeongsun, the second wife of King Yeongjo, and by his adoptive mother, Nam Yang-hong, he was a cousin to Namyeon-gun Yi Gu, who was destined to be the grandfather of King Gojong (È´òÂÆó, later titled ÂÖâÊ≠¶Â∏ù Gwangmu Emperor. 1852‚Äì1919). Heungseon Daewongun (ËààÂÆ£Â§ßÈô¢Âêõ, 1820‚Äì1898), King Gojong‚Äôs father who served as his regent and was also a noted calligrapher, was one of Gim‚Äôs pupils for a while. Biography =Early life: Birth and family= Gim was born in the family home in Yesan, now South Chungcheong Province, in 1786. He was the eldest son. His birth father was Gim No-gyeong (ÈáëÈ≠ØÊï¨, 1766 - 1840); his grandfather was Gim I-ju (ÈáëÈ†§Êü±, ? ‚Äì 1797) and his great-grandfather was Weolseongui Gim Han-sin (ÊúàÂüéÂ∞â ÈáëÊº¢Ëóé, 1720‚Äì1758) who married the second daughter of King Yeongjo, the Princess Hwasun (ÂíåÈ†ÜÁøÅ‰∏ª, 1720 - 1758). His ancestors and relatives held many high administrative positions and several were noted for their calligraphy. His mother was a member of the Gigye Yu clan, a daughter of Yu Jun-ju (ÂÖ™ÈßøÊü±), the governor of Gimhae. He is reputed to have been a remarkable calligrapher already as a child. When he was 7, the famed scholar Chae Je-gong (Ëî°ÊøüÊÅ≠, 1720 - 1799) is said to have been impressed on seeing the ‚ÄúIpchun Daegil Cheonha Daepyeongchun‚Äù (Á´ãÊò•Â§ßÂêâ Â§©‰∏ãÂ§™Âπ≥Êò•) good-luck charm marking the coming of spring that he had written, pasted on the gate of the family home.http://www.chusa.or.kr/life/life_term.html From the age of 15 he received instruction from the celebrated Bukhak (ÂåóÂ≠∏, ‚ÄúNorthern Learning)‚Äù scholar Pak Je-ga (Êú¥ÈΩäÂÆ∂, 1750‚Äì1805). =Early youth= In the 1790s, the head of the family, his eldest uncle, Gim No-yeong (ÈáëÈ≠ØÊ∞∏, 1747‚Äì1707), was sent into exile, while another uncle as well as his grandparents all died in quick succession. It was decided that Gim Jeong-hui should be adopted by Gim No- yeong (who had several daughters but no son) and so become the next head of the family. When he was 15, in 1800, he married a member of the Hansan Yi clan (ÈñëÂ±±ÊùéÊ∞è). That same year, King Jeongjo died and Queen Jeongsun, the widow of the previous King Yeongjo, became regent, since the new king was only a child. Gim Jeong-hui's birth father benefitted from the family's relationship with the regent and was raised to a high rank. =Later youth= Gim Jeong-hui's birth mother died in 1801, aged only 34. Queen Jeongsun died in 1805, and Gim Jeong- hui's young wife died only a few weeks after her. His teacher Pak Je-ga also died that year and these multiple deaths seem to have encouraged his already deep interest in Buddhism as a source of consolation and meaning. His adoptive mother also died at around this time and once mourning for her was over, he married a slightly younger second wife in 1808, a member of the Yean Yi clan (Á¶ÆÂÆâ ÊùéÊ∞è). In 1809 he took first place in the lower Gwageo civil examination. =Adult life= =Visit to China= In 1810, his adoptive father was appointed a vice-envoy in the annual embassy to Qing China and he accompanied him, spending some 6 months in China. There he met such noted scholars as Weng Fanggang (ÁøÅÊñπÁ∂±, 1733‚Äì1818) and Ruan Yuan (ÈòÆÂÖÉ, 1764‚Äì1849) who recognized his qualities. He seems to have studied documentary history there especially. Ruan Yuan gave him a copy of his ‚ÄúSu Zhai Biji‚Äù (ËòáÈΩãÁ≠ÜË®ò), a book about calligraphy, and Gim continued to correspond with them after his return to Korea. For a time after returning home he did not take up any official position but continued to study the Northern Learning and write essays criticizing rigid Neo-Confucianism. He also pursued research by visiting and studying the inscriptions on ancient stele. In 1815, the Venerable Cho-ui first visited Seoul and met Gim Jeong-hui there. This was the beginning of a deep and lasting relationship. Perhaps it was from this time that Gim began to drink tea, there is no knowing. =Success in national exams= Passing the Gwageo national exam held to mark an eclipse year in 1819, he rose to such positions as secret inspector and tutor to the Crown Prince. Following the death of the prince, power passed to the conservative Andong Gim clan and Gim was reduced in rank while his adoptive father was exiled for several years, until 1834. In 1835, after the accession of King Heonjong, the family's fortunes turned and Gim Jeong-hui rose to ministerial rank. In the same year he visited the Ven. Cho-ui at Daedun-sa temple (Â§ßËäöÂØ∫), now called Daeheung-sa). =Exile= Following the death of King Sunjo of Joseon (r. 1800-1834) late in 1834, Queen Sunwon, the wife of Sunjo and a member of the Gim clan of Andong, held immense power after her grandson, Heonjong (ÊÜ≤ÂÆó, 1827‚Äì1849 ), still only a child, was made king. Queen Gim acted as his regent. Factional in-fighting increased and in 1840, when he was due to be a member of the Chinese embassy, Gim Jeong-hui was instead condemned to exile in Jeju Island. Late in 1842 his wife died. He was finally allowed to return home early in 1849. It was during those years in exile that he developed the calligraphic style known as the ‚ÄúChusa style,‚Äù based on his studies of models dating back to the earliest periods of Korean and Chinese history. On his way into exile and on his way back home afterward, he visited the Venerable Cho-ui in his Ilchi-am hermitage at what is now known as Daeheung-sa temple. Cho-ui consecrated several of his building projects in the temple to helping sustain Gim during his exile and visited him in Jeju-do 5-6 times, bringing him gifts of tea. .Korean Tea Classics ed./trans. Brother Anthony of Taiz√©, Hong Keong-Hee, Steven D. Owyoung. Seoul: Seoul Selection. 2010. Page 64. In 1844, during his exile in Jeju Island, he produced his most celebrated ink painting, usually known as ‚ÄúSehando‚Äù or ‚ÄúWandang Sehando‚Äù (ÈòÆÂ†ÇÊ≠≤ÂØíÂúñ, ‚ÄòWandang‚Äô was one of Gim's most frequently used ‚ÄòHo‚Äô names; ‚ÄòSehan‚Äô means ‚Äòthe bitter cold around the lunar new year,‚Äô ‚Äòdo‚Äô means ‚Äòpainting‚Äô), which he gave to his disciple Yi Sang-jeok (ÊùéÂ∞ôËø™, 1804‚Äì1865) in gratitude for his friendship, which included bringing him precious books from China. The painting shows a simple house, barely outlined, framed by two gnarled pine trees. Beside it there are texts expressing gratitude to Yi Sang-jeok. Yi was an outstanding figure, a poet and calligrapher who went 12 times to China and was greatly admired by the scholars he met there. In 1845, Yi returned to China with the painting, which he showed to the scholars he met. Sixteen of them composed appreciatiative colophons which were attached to the left side of the painting, creating a lengthy scroll. After Yi's return to Korea, some Korean scholars also added their tributes, creating a unique cumulative work combining painting, poetic writing and calligraphy.The Moam Collection Blog in Korean Soon after King Heonjong in 1849, there were disputes over the relocation of his tomb, in which a friend of Gim Jeong-hui, Gwon Don-in, was involved. as a result, both were sent into exile, Gim spending the years 1850-2 in Bukcheong, Hamgyeong-do province, far in the North. Final years After the northern exile, he settled in Gwacheon (to the south of Seoul, where his birth father was buried) in a house he called Gwaji Chodang (ÁìúÂú∞ËçâÂ†Ç). In 1856 he went to stay for a while in Bongeun-sa temple, in what is now Seoul's Gangnam area, and is said to have become a monk. Later that same year he returned to his home in Gwacheon, and continued to write until the day before he died. In the years following his death, his disciple Nam Byeong-gil (ÂçóÁßâÂêâ) and others prepared and published collections of his letters (Wandang Cheokdok ÈòÆÂ†ÇÂ∞∫Áâò) and of his poems (Damyeon Jaesigo Ë¶ÉÁ≥ßÈΩãË©©ËóÅ) in 1867; a collection of his other writings (Wandangjip ÈòÆÂ†ÇÈõÜ) was published in 1868. A complete edition of his works, (Wandang Seonsaeng Jeonjip ÈòÆÂ†ÇÂÖàÁîüÂÖ®ÈõÜ), was published by his great- great-grandson Gim Ik-hwan (ÈáëÁøäÁÖ•) in 1934. Achievements The influence of Gim Jeong-hui among the Korean scholars of the later 19th century was immense. He was reputed to have taught 3,000 of them and was seen as the leader of a modernizing trend that developed into the Gaehwapa Enlightenment Party at the end of the 19th century. Among the names associated with him we find Shin Wi (Áî≥Á∑Ø, 1769‚Äì1845), O Gyeong-seok (Âê≥ÊÖ∂Èå´, 1831‚Äì1879), Min Tae-ho (ÈñîÂè∞Èé¨, 1834‚Äì1884), Min Gyu-ho (ÈñîÂ•éÈé¨, 1836‚Äì1878), Gang Wi (ÂßúÁëã, 1820‚Äì1884). His main scholarly interest was in documentary history and monumental inscriptions. He maintained correspondence on these topics with major scholars in China. He was particularly celebrated for having deciphered and identified the stele on Mount Bukhan commemorating a visit by King Jinheung of Silla (540‚Äì576). He is remembered for his outstanding achievements in calligraphy, ink painting, as well as his writings in prose and poetry. He was in the habit of devising a special Ho (pen-name) for himself whenever he dedicated a painting of orchids to an acquaintance, so that he became the person of his generation with the most such names. Buddhism It seems that Gim Jeong-hui was accustomed to frequenting Buddhist temples from his childhood onward. There are indications that the sudden death in or around 1805 of several of those he had been close to drove him to deepen his Buddhist practice. Among his calligraphic work, a number of copies of Buddhist S≈´tras and other texts survive and he wrote name boards for halls in Daeheung-sa, Bongeun-sa and other temples. The reformists of the Practical Learning tradition often showed an interest in either Catholicism or Buddhism, as part of their reaction against the rigidly secular Neo-Confucianist philosophy. He was especially close to the Ven. Cho-ui Seonsa (ËçâË°£Á¶™Â∏´, Uiseon (ÊÑèÊÅÇ, 1786‚Äì1866) and Baekpa Daesa (ÁôΩÂù°Â§ßÂ∏´, Geungseon ‰∫òÁíá, 1767‚Äì1852). In 1815, Cho-ui first visited Seoul and established strong relationships with a number of highly educated scholar-officials, several of whom had been to China, who became his friends and followers. These included the son-in-law of King Jeongjo (Ê≠£Á•ñ r. 1776-1800), Haegeo-doin Hong Hyeon-Ju Êµ∑Â±Ö ÈÅì‰∫∫ Ê¥™È°ØÂë® (1793‚Äì1865) and his brother Yeoncheon Hong Seok-Ju Ê∑µÊ≥â Ê¥™Â•≠Âë® (1774‚Äì1842), the son of Dasan Jeong Yak-yong, Unpo Jeong Hak-Yu ËÄòÈÄã ‰∏ÅÂ≠∏Ê∏∏ (1786‚Äì1855), as well as Gim Jeong-Hui and his brothers Sanchon Gim Myeong-hui Â±±Ê≥â ÈáëÂëΩÂñú (1788‚Äì1857) and Geummi Gim Sang-hu Áê¥Á≥ú ÈáëÁõ∏Âñú (1794‚Äì1861). It was most unusual for a Buddhist monk, who as such was assigned the lowest rank in society, to be recognized as a poet and thinker in this way by members of the Confucian establishment. As a monk, Cho-ui was not allowed to enter the city walls of Seoul and had to receive visits from these scholars while living in Cheongnyangsa temple Ê∑∏Ê∂ºÂØ∫ outside the capital's eastern gate or in a hermitage in the hills to the north. Gim Jeong-Hui had initiated a controversy with the other celebrated Seon Master Baekpa Geungseon (ÁôΩÂù° ‰∫òÁíá, 1767‚Äì1852) who had written the Seonmun sugyeong (Á¶™ÊñáÊâãÈè° Hand Glass of Seon Literature). In his Baekpa Mangjeungsipojo (ÁôΩÂù° Â¶ÑË≠âÂçÅ‰∫îÊ¢ù Fifteen Signs of Baekpa's Senility), Gim wrote, ‚ÄúThe truth of Seon is like a light new dress without stitching, just like a heavenly dress. But the dress is patched and repatched by the inventiveness of humans, and so becomes a wornout piece of clothing.‚Äù Baekpa had written that certain traditions were superior to others, and Gim considered such quibbles to be a waste of time as well as a misunderstanding of the nature of Seon. Nonetheless, when Baekpa died at Hwaeom-sa Temple in 1852, Gim wrote an epitaph for him: ËèØÂö¥ÂÆó‰∏ªÁôΩÂù°Â§ßÂæãÂ∏´Â§ßÊ©üÂ§ßÁî®‰πãÁ¢ë.[6]Korean Tea Classics ed./trans.

Gramlich (June 18, 1939 - September 5, 2007) was a professor of economics at the University of Michigan and a former member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. Gramlich graduated from Williams College in 1961 and received a master's degree in 1962 and a Ph.D. in economics in 1965 from Yale University. He joined the Federal Reserve as a research economist from 1965-1970, and was a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution from 1973-1976. He then taught economics and public policy at the University of Michigan from 1976 to 1997, including a term as dean of the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, and returned to Michigan as a professor in 2005. He was appointed to the Federal Reserve System by President Bill Clinton in 1997 and resigned in August 2005. For much of his term, he was the Chair of the Board's Committee on Consumer and Community Affairs. He was also the chairman of the Air Transportation Stabilization Board, which was created by Congress after the 9/11 attacks raised concerns about the survival of the U.S. airline industry. Gramlich had also chaired several other lesser-known stabilization boards created by Congress. In an April 2003 speech to the National Economists Club, he concluded that such boards are an ineffective way to help struggling industries because of the time it takes before help arrives and because the industries that are in need of help often have far deeper problems that the stabilization boards cannot fix. ‚ÄúIf Congress wants to bail out an industry in a hurry, it should bail it out. It takes time to act in this program, which means it's probably not a good program for [emergency] scenarios‚Äù, Gramlich told the club. Gramlich was also formerly the chairman of the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation and was seen as an expert on subprime lending after his years as a banking regulator at the Federal Reserve. Gramlich had other government experience as well, serving as chairman of the Quadrennial Advisory Council on Social Security from 1994 to 1996 and as deputy director, and then acting director, of the Congressional Budget Office in 1986-1987. He also conducted research in 1992 on the economics of major league baseball and wrote a popular textbook on benefit-cost analysis that is in its second edition. Gramlich highlighted the problems with subprime mortgages prior to the 2007-09 financial crisis. His book, \\"Subprime Mortgages: America's Latest Boom and Bust\\" (2007) was published before the crisis was widely recognized and he had spoken out about them earlier. Gramlich died on September 5, 2007 from acute myeloid leukemia. He and his wife, Ruth had two children, Sarah and Robert, both married, and six grandchildren.

It is the largest archaeological site of a pyramid (temple) in the New World, as well as the largest pyramid by volume known to exist in the world today.Coe & Koontz 1962, 2002, p. 120.The giant pyramid hidden inside a mountain, BBC News, retrieved on August 15, 2016 The pyramid stands above the surrounding plain, and in its final form it measured . The pyramid is a temple that traditionally has been viewed as having been dedicated to the god Quetzalcoatl.Coe & Koontz 1962, 2002, p. 121. The architectural style of the building was linked closely to that of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico, although influence from the Gulf Coast also is evident, especially from El Taj√≠n.Davies 1982, 1990, p. 92. Location and etymology The Cholula archaeological zone is situated west of the city of Puebla,Solanes Carraro 1991, p. 2. in the city of Cholula. The pyramid is located in the San Andr√©s Cholula, Puebla municipality, and marks the area in the center of the city where this municipality begins. The city is divided into two municipalities called San Andr√©s and San Pedro. This division originates in the Toltec-Chichimeca conquest of the city in the twelfth century. These pushed the former dominant ethnicity of the Olmeca-Xicalanca, to the south of the city. These people kept the pyramid as their primary religious center, but the newly dominant Toltec-Chichimecas founded a new temple to Quetzalcoatl where the San Gabriel monastery is now. The Toltec- Chichimec people who settled in the area around the twelfth century AD named Cholula as Tlachihualtepetl, meaning \\"artificial hill\\". The name cholula has its origin in the ancient Nahuatl word cholollan, which means \\"place of refuge\\". History Model of the various structures that make up the pyramid The Great Pyramid was an important religious and mythical centre in prehispanic times.Solanes Carraro 1991, p. 4. Over a period of a thousand years prior to the Spanish Conquest, consecutive construction phases gradually built up the bulk of the pyramid until it became the largest in Mexico by volume. =Classic= The temple-pyramid complex was built in four stages, starting from the 3rd century BC through the 9th century AD, and was dedicated to the deity Quetzalcoatl. It has a base of and a height of 66 m (217 ft). According to the Guinness Book of Records, it is, in fact, the largest pyramid as well as the largest monument ever constructed anywhere in the world, with a total volume estimated at over 4.45 million cubic metres, even larger than that of the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, which is about 2.5 million cubic metres. However the Great Pyramid of Giza is higher at .Lehner 1997. The ceramics of Cholula were closely linked to those of Teotihuacan, and both sites appeared to decline simultaneously.Davies 1982, 1990, p. 93. The Postclassic Aztecs believed that Xelhua built the Great Pyramid of Cholula. At its peak, Cholula had the second largest population in Mexico of an estimated 100,000 people living at this site.http://www.aztec-history.com/cholula- pyramid.html Though the prehispanic city of Cholula remained inhabited, residents abandoned the Great Pyramid in the 8th century as the city suffered a drastic population drop. Even after this population drop, the Great Pyramid retained its religious importance. The site was once called Acholollan (in Nahuatl) meaning place of flight. This meaning has led some to believe that this site was founded after its original inhabitants fled elsewhere. =Postclassic and Colonial= The Toltec-Chichimec History, a codex from the Cholula region, relates that an Olmec-Xicalanca lord with the title Aquiyach Amapane resided at the Great Pyramid.Solanes Carraro 1991, pp. 2‚Äì3. In the 12th century, after the Toltec-Chichimecas took over the city, religious focus shifted away from the pyramid and to a new temple.Solanes Carraro 1991, p. 3. Even during the Postclassic period, long after locals abandoned the pyramid, they continued to bury their deceased around the structure, demonstrating its continued importance. By the time the Spanish arrived, the pyramid was overgrown, and by the 19th century it was still undisturbed, with only the church built in the 16th century visible. =Modern history= Architect Ignacio Marquina started exploratory tunnelling within the pyramid in 1931.Solanes Carraro 1991, p. 5. By 1954, the total length of tunnels came to approximately . Today the pyramid at first looks like a natural hill surmounted by a church. This is the Iglesia de Nuestra Se√±ora de los Remedios (Church of Our Lady of Remedies), also known as the Santuario de la Virgen de los Remedios (Sanctuary of the Virgin of Remedies), which was built by the Spanish in colonial times (1594) on top of the prehispanic temple. The church is a major Catholic pilgrimage destination, and the site is also used for the celebration of indigenous rites. Many ancient sites in Latin America are found under modern Catholic holy sites, due to the practice of the Catholic Church of repurposing local religious sites. Because of the historic and religious significance of the church, which is a designated colonial monument, the pyramid as a whole has not been excavated and restored, as have the smaller but better-known pyramids at Teotihuacan. Inside the pyramid are some five miles (8 km) of tunnels excavated by archaeologists. Pyramid Artist's conception of what the pyramid might have looked like The pyramid consists of six superimposed structures, one for each ethnic group that dominated it. However, only three have been studied in any depth. The pyramid itself is just a small part of the greater archaeological zone of Cholula, which is estimated at .Ram√≠rez 2003. Building of the pyramid began in the Preclassic Period and over time was built over six times to its final dimensions of 450 metres on each side at the base and 66 metres tall. The base covers a total area of 160,000 square meters, making it three times greater than the 53,056.5 square meter base of Pharaoh Khufu's Great Pyramid of Giza. Tlachihualtepetl has the largest pyramid base in the Americas. The earliest construction phase features talud-tablero architecture that is characteristic of the region, and that became strongly associated with the great metropolis of Teotihuacan. Some of the pyramid constructions have had burials, with skeletons found in various positions, with many offerings, especially ceramics. The last state of construction has stairs on the west side leading to a temple on top, which faced Iztacc√≠huatl. During the colonial period, the pyramid was severely damaged on its north side to build the Camino Real to Puebla. The west was damaged later with the installation of a rail line.Sol√≠s, p. 61. =Excavation history= The first study of the pyramid area was done by Adolph Bandelier, a Swiss-born American archaeologist with an interest in Mexico. He arrived at Cholula in 1881 and published his findings about the site in 1884. Most of Bandelier's work involved the unearthing of various burials in the area around the pyramid, principally collecting skulls, which was standard practice at the time. Many of these wound up in storerooms in U.S. museums. Bandelier also took the first precise measurements of the structure, made some headway into how it was constructed and worked on domestic structures that coincide with the pyramid. Bandelier was also the first to make precise field notes at the site and the earliest plan of the site. Bandelier also showed interest in two nearby mounds called the Cerro de Acozac and the Cerro de la Cruz, which at that time were totally covered in vegetation.Sol√≠s, pp. 59‚Äì60. The pyramid was excavated in two phases. The first began in 1931 and ended in the 1950s. Excavations began again in 1966 and officially ended in 1970, with the publication of the reports of the various academics who worked on Proyecto Cholula.Sol√≠s, p. 60. Exploration of the pyramid itself began in 1931 under architect Ignacio Marquina who dug tunnels to explore the substructures. This was a time of political instability in Mexico, mostly due to the Cristero War. However, the decision was made to excavate the structure because of the success of the excavations of Teotihuacan by Manuel Gamio in the 1920s.Sol√≠s, p. 62. The project was given to Marquina because of his experience working with Gamio in Teotihuacan. While credit is given to Marquina, he spent little time at the site. Most of the work was really done by Marino G√≥mez, the site guardian, who directed the digging of the tunnels. These tunnels allowed for the mapping and modelling of the pyramid's successive layers.Sol√≠s, pp. 62‚Äì3. The pyramid had no obvious entrance, due to its deteriorated condition, but the archaeologists decided to begin tunnelling on the north side, where colonial construction had damaged it. On this side, the remains of walls and other structures could be seen. Tunnelling techniques were based on various team members' experience at Teotihuacan and Tenayuca. These techniques were based on mining, even using small tracks and miniature coal cars to carry out debris. Examples of these are at the site museum. The base of the pyramid was constructed of sun-dried adobe bricks, which contained ceramic, obsidian and gravel for better compacting. This solid foundation allowed the excavators to only need to create \\"false arches,\\" like those found in Mayan constructions, rather than adding beams and other supports. The first two tunnels were built to cris-cross the centre, one north/south and the other east/west. When the tunnels reached substructure, they then followed the contour of the structure, and eventually the various tunnels created an underground labyrinth. By 1939, there were four kilometers of tunnels, with two more added by 1951.Sol√≠s, pp. 63‚Äì4. The tunnels demonstrate the real value of the pyramid, which is not visible on the surface.Sol√≠s, p. 63. During the first round of excavations, sixteen holes were dug in the area by Eduardo Noguera to extract ceramic materials and establish a time line. The results of these were published in 1954 as La ceramic arqueol√≥gica de Cholula. The pieces ranged from clay figures made when the settlement was just a village, to the Pre-classic. The latter ones include figures that are definitely nude females with complicated hair styles. Figures from later periods, such as those coinciding with Tula and Teotihuacan, tend to be of gods and priests. Various musical instruments, such as flutes, were also found, as well as tools for the making of textiles, amate paper and axes. One major find included a ceremonial scepter carved from bone, with images related to the concept of life and death as a duality.Sol√≠s, pp. 67‚Äì8. The first round of excavation work ended in the 1950s. The second round of excavations took place from 1966 to 1974 under the name of Proyecto Cholula. This was spurred, in part, by reconstructed pyramids in Mexico, which had become tourist attractions. This project was sponsored by both the federal and state governments, who wanted to make Cholula an attraction, as well. The archaeology and anthropology fields had experienced changes since Marquina's work, mostly focusing on a more interdisciplinary approach. The first person in charge of the site was Miguel Messmacher in 1966. After only six months of work, Messmacher released a preliminary report in 1967. One of the main finds during this time was that of Edificio I (Building I). In addition to the excavating of the main structures of the pyramid, Messmacher, Eduardo Matos Moctezuma and others in the project worked on more multidisciplinary tasks, such as determining agricultural patterns of the site, ceramic development and water distribution systems. However, this put them in conflict with the sponsors of the project, along with the INAH, which favored a more restricted approach that focused on reconstructing the pyramid.Sol√≠s, pp. 70‚Äì2. In 1967, INAH decided to replace Messmacher with Ignacio Marquina as head of the team excavating the site, which prompted most of the younger researchers to leave the project. While the focus was placed back on the pyramid proper, the project did not lose all of its interdisciplinary character, keeping experts in areas such as geology, botany and paleozoology. The project began to focus on the south side of the pyramid, excavating the remains of plazas and buildings that made up a large complex. However, it was difficult to link these structures to those in the interior of the pyramid. The patios were unearthed in layers as far back as the Classic period (200 to 800 AD) and the beginnings of the Post-classic, during the occupation of the Olmecas Xicallancas. These structures were later reconstructed. The most important elements unearthed during this time were the Courtyard of the Altars and Edificio F (Building F).Sol√≠s, pp. 72‚Äì5. By the official end of the project in 1974, interest in the pyramid waned again as it could not be reconstructed in its entirety, like other major pyramids in Mexico. The project was abandoned, leaving only fragmentary knowledge about it.Sol√≠s, p. 77. Despite the site's pre-Hispanic importance, this pyramid is relatively unknown and unstudied, especially in comparison to others in Mexico such as Teotihuacan, Chichen Itza and Monte Alb√°n. There are a number of possible reasons for this. One is that its existence was not greatly elaborated in a publication by the Mexican government for the 1928 Congreso Internacional de Americanistas in New York. There is only one short mention of the pyramid in the entire work. However, by this time, only Bandelier had done any work on the site. Of all the work done from the 1930s to the 1950s, there was only one presentation, at the XXVII Congreso Internacional de Americanistas de M√©xico in 1939.Sol√≠s, p. 69. In 1951, Marquina included Cholula in a work called Arqutectura prehisp√°nica along with information from the various major sites of the country. However, interest waned in the Cholula site in the 1950s. One reason for this was that, at the time, it was common to reconstruct the major buildings, especially pyramids, even though these reconstructions were often exaggerated. No such reconstruction is possible with the Cholula pyramid.Sol√≠s, p. 70. Most of the publications that do exist are technical field reports with few syntheses of data gathered. For this reason, it has not played a significant role in the understanding of Mesoamerica as to date. Due to the condition of the surface and the large number of artifacts just under the surface, it is not possible to reconstruct the last stage of the pyramid to what it was. =Elements= Excavations have resulted in about eight kilometers of tunnels inside the pyramid, which began with two in 1931 to prove that the hill was an archeological find. Within, altars with offerings, floors, walls and buried human remains from around 900 AD were discovered. Today, only about 800 meters of these tunnels are open to the public, which have been made into well-lit, arched passages. Visitors enter on the north side, through the center of the pyramid and exit on the south side. There are few signs explaining the structures within, but in one section allows a view of main staircases of one of the pyramids, whose nine floors have been excavated from bottom to top. There are also two famous murals. One is called \\"Chapulines,\\" which consists of images of grasshoppers with a black skull in the middle. And the other is the \\"Bebedores,\\" which depicts various figures drinking out of vessels most commonly used for pulque. Around the pyramid are a number of other structures and patios, which form a massive complex. The Patio of the Altars was the main access to the pyramid and is named for the various altars that surround a main courtyard. Initial excavations eventually indicated that the main access to the pyramid was on the west side, which latter excavations confirmed. Both also showed that there usually were minor accesses on the northeast and southwest corners. Building A or La Conejera Building A is the earliest version of the pyramid also called \\"La Conejera.\\" This structure was discovered in the 1950s, near the end of the first round of excavations. It is a pre-Teotihuacan structure, relatively simple with an adobe core.Sol√≠s, pp. 68‚Äì9. However, it was not found directly under the other layers of the Pyramid, but rather under a structure known as the Edificio Rojo (Red Building) in the northeast corner. This makes the oldest pyramid of the site \\"off-center\\" in relation to the later pyramids. It was built with an adobe core with a base of about ten meters square. It has a wall in talud topped with a 57 cm cornice. Over this, a two-story chamber faced south. One side of La Conejera, eight rounded steps made of earth with a stone core lead to the west side of the structure, into a hallway. This bears some resemblance to the rounded pyramid of Cuicuilco. From the ceramics found with it, the structure has been dated to about 200 BC, contemporary with sites such as Zacatenco and El Arbolillo in the Valley of Mexico. La Conejera's base, cornice and chamber were all painted. Black paint remains on the base. The cornice on the northwest corner had white squares painted over a black background. Investigators have assumed that this pattern was repeated over the rest of the cornice. Both the outer and inner walls of the chamber were painted red several times with no designs.Rodr√≠guez p. 134. Building B or Pyramid of the Painted Skulls Building B or the Pyramid of the Painted Skulls was centered in a spot a few meters from La Conejera. Later expansions of this pyramid eventually covered La Conejera and the Edificio Rojo built over it. The Pyramid of the Painted Skulls was built between 200 and 350 AD, consisting of seven stepped levels with an adobe nucleus. It was finished with adobe and rock, and smoothed with earth mixed with lime to create a painting surface. The architecture is significant because of its talud-tablero structure, and its mural-decorated walls. This structure was constructed in two phases. The first created a rectangular platform 113 meters by 107 meters. On top of this is a two-story structure, eighteen meters high with stairs on the west. This structure is made of adobe bricks, which stone and clay used in the areas with stairs. Marquina determined that this structure had an east-west orientation, similar to the Pyramid of the Sun, coinciding with the Teotihuacan civilization, and later ceramic studies placed it with Teotihuacan II.Sol√≠s, pp. 64‚Äì5. Only the murals of the upper two stories of this pyramid have been studied, on the taluds and tableros of the north side as well as those on the northeast corner. The talud has traces of black and the two-meter tableros consist of a frieze measuring 46 cm wide with a double frame or border that juts out from the frieze. This is characteristic of Cholula architecture. These tableros usually have one color as the base, but with stripes of other colors on top, such as yellow, red and blue. The north side is completely free of paint on the left side, but on the right, there are pockets of color remaining. The highest story contains nine skulls painted on it, which the lower one had seven.Rodr√≠guez, p. 134. These skulls were initially thought to be the heads of grasshoppers facing forward, but later studies determined that they depict highly stylized human skulls. These skulls look forward and are painted yellow and red over a black background. Above the skulls are decorative markers that look like arrows, which indicate the direction of the scene. Those on the left side point east, and those on the right point west. To the sides are stylized wings in red, green and ochre. One of the most important discoveries between 1932 and 1936 was the Altar of the Sculpted Skulls, which was officially reported by archeologist Eduardo Noguera in 1937. This building is located in one of the lower levels of the northeast patio area, attached to the base of the Pyramid of the Painted Skulls. The architectural aspects of this altar, however, correspond to the Post classic period. The altar sits on a platform and faces east, in front of which are stairs to climb the platform. For this reason, it is considered a momeztli type of altar, which are placed on ceremonial platforms. It has a square base with its north, south, and west sides done in talud that rise up to a decorated section that is topped with a cornice. The access stairs have parallel beams that culminate in dados ‚Äì an element found in Tenayuca and other Mexica areas. The name comes from the three human skulls made from clay, with bulging eyes and covered in stucco, along with the rest of the structure. This ornamental feature relates to the function of the altar, which is believed to be a mausoleum. It contains the remains of a man and woman. The female skeleton is accompanied by grave goods related to domestic life such as comals, bone needles, spindles, and pots. The male skeleton probably belonged to a renowned warrior. His grave goods are far richer, with ritual vessels, and elegant vase with a multicolored design, obsidian arrowheads, and a musical instrument called an omexicahuaztli. A jawbone of a xoloitzcuintle dog was also found. Pre-Hispanic people considered dogs guides to the underworld. The function of this mausoleum was mostly likely to perpetuate the memory of the male warrior.Sol√≠s, pp. 6‚Äì7. It has two levels. One is a pyramidal platform and the other is a talud-tablero structure with a double cornice and crest in adobe, decorated with interlocked designs in low relief painted red, yellow and green. The talud is painted black as well as the bottom part of the tablero, with some minor details in ochre. The north side only shows the jaw and eye of a skull and some of the arrow and other effects seen on the pyramid it is associated with. The west side contains two skulls. One conserves about half of the original to see its open mouth and white teeth. The figure is outlined in ochre and black. The other skull contains only traces of these colors. The lower cornice on the north side is divided by horizontal bands, black above and red below. The interior cornice has double bands of green and red. To the extreme west of the painting, there are skull designs.Rodriguez, p. 135. Building C or the Pyramid of the Nine Stories Building C or the Pyramid of the Nine Stories, was built over Building B between 350 and 450 AD, and is bigger by volume than the Pyramid of the Moon at Teotihuacan. This latter phase was a radial pyramid, with stairways climbing all four sides of the structure. The Pyramid of the Nine Stories was built over the oldest structure using adobe again for expansion to a pyramid with a base of 190 meters squared and a height of 34 meters. Instead of a surface of earth and lime, this pyramid was finished with rock and stucco, which is more durable. Its architectural style is distinct from the one before. It consists of nine stories with talud only, covered in stucco. Each story above is smaller than below, leaving a space of two meters. The entrance stairs were those on the southeast corner, with those on the other three serving as exits. These walls were painted black with the stucco serving as white.Sol√≠s, pp. 65‚Äì6. Associated with the Stepped Pyramid is the Jaguar Altar, which is located on the southeast corner. The west and south sides of the altar's two levels have been explored. There is evidence that this altar was covered in decoration. On the west side of the first level, there is evidence of black, red, green and ochre paint. On the lower part of the south wall, there are fragments of red, black and ochre. Above this, there is a well conserved section of 3.15 m by 53 cm, with a black and green background with red stripes. There are also the profiles of a jaguar and two serpents. (chapter 4 135) The final phase covered Building C, burying it within its adobe core. The facing of this phase has collapsed to give the impression of a natural hill. Other elements Marquina's first publication about the site in 1939 notes the existence of a Northeast Plaza, which was an unusual find at the time. This plaza contains three pyramid shaped structures in talud-tablero but in extremely poor condition. However, one important find about them was that their bases were painted with black square, vaguely resembling the niches of El Taj√≠n. =Courtyard of Altars= View of the main courtyard The Courtyard of Altars is a complex of buildings adjoining the south side of the pyramid. It was one of the most important finds of the 1967 to 1970s round of excavation, named such because of several altars found here. Eduardo Matos Moctezuma had begun to touch on this area with his excavation of Edifico I in 1966 and 1967. The structure consists of a very large open area measuring seventy by fifty-four meters, bordered by the pyramid proper to the north, and on the east and west sides by two complicated raised platforms, named Patio Sureste and Gran Plaza Suroeste by the excavators. These platforms are similar to those in the Northeast plaza, but they are up against the side of the main pyramid, which was done to amplify the patio's hierarchical and ritual nature. The area was mostly likely used for large, spectacular ceremonies as well as for rites associated with the passing of power. The taluds are wide, which is characteristic of Cholula, and decorated with moldings consisting of T formations. The tableros were painted with aquatic symbols and bands of red, blue, yellow and black. The access to the two main platforms and the side of the pyramid are marked by wide stairs. The Gran Plaza Suroeste shows strong Teotihuacan influence, with four rooms over taluds that surround a patio. One of these rooms contains a model of a pyramid base that may represent the Gran Pyramid in miniature.Sol√≠s, pp. 73‚Äì5. Excavations have revealed that these annexes were built up in a series of at least six construction phases, enclosing a central courtyard. As new phases of construction took place, newer versions of buildings were built over the pre-existing version, covering the lower part and adding a new or modified facade, resulting in the reduction of the courtyard area by the gradual encroachment of the surrounding structures and added several metres to the original platform height. These are buildings were arranged on the east and west sides of an early wide platform. Further structures were built against the rear facades of these buildings, forming two wide side plazas. The buildings that can be seen today date to the latest construction phase of the courtyard.Solanes Carraro 1991, p. 6. Buildings on this south side contain significant mural work, including patterns on the various constructions associated with Building 3 (Building 3-1-A, Building 3-2, etc.). It also includes the only mural with anthropomorphic figures, called the Mural of the Drinkers. Structure 4 is decorated with T-shaped frets upon its sloping taluds. Some sections of this decoration still display original colouring, with diagonal bands of red, blue, yellow, black and turquoise. The decoration also includes symbols that may represent stars. Altars Altar Four altars were excavated from the final construction phase of the Courtyard of Altars. Three of them were decorated with low relief sculpture, which has allowed for the recovery of some of the fragments of Cholula's history.Sol√≠s, p. 73. The centre section of each altar was left blank but may originally have been painted with religious designs. Altar 1 consists of a large vertical stone measuring 3.85 meters in height and 2.12 in width. When it was found, it was in twenty-two pieces. It is known that it was found in situ looking west although its offerings had long since been looted. Shortly after, its base was found. Its purpose is not clear as there are few decorative features, leading some to speculate that it was painted. New studies show similarities between this stone and decorative elements at El Taj√≠n.Sol√≠s, pp. 73‚Äì4. Altar 2 is a more traditional ritual monument for Mesoamerica and fits the altar genre. It is a narrow rectangular stone, oriented to the east, in a horizontal position. It functioned as a kind of pedestal, with each of the sides richly ornamented. On one side, there are two feathered serpents extending along the length.Sol√≠s, p. 74. Altar 3 may have been the most important as it is next to the pyramid. It faces south and is similar to Altar 1 as it is a vertical stone. Its shape is that of a rectangle topped by a triangle. Its decoration consists of a lateral band with relieves similar to those of Altar One, that is El Taj√≠n style. When it was found, it was lying on a platform, which indicates something happened to the site, but it is not known what. Other large stone sculptures were found in the area. One is the head of a serpent with geometric designs that correspond to the Niu√±e tradition in Oaxaca. There is also a giant human head, with the edges of its eyes and mouth marked in a way that resembles Xipe, which could correspond to a post-Olmec tradition, as similar figures were found in Tlaxcala. Mural work One of the murals of Building 3 covered by a protective roof Painting and mural work was found on various levels of the main pyramid, on the Edificio Rojo, the La Conejera, the Pyramid of the Painted Skulls, the Altar of the Painted Skulls, the Stepped Pyramid, the Jaguar Altar, Edificio D and Edificio F. Studies of the various mural fragments found so far in the pre- Hispanic city of Cholula have reflected the political, economic and social changes over time. They also help to ascertain Cholula's relevance with the rest of Mesoamerica. There have been twenty one painted areas discovered by archaeologists, with eight mostly lost and thirteen still existing in situ. Most of the works belong to the Classic period, excepting those in the Edificio Rojo, which are from the Pre classic. The way that taluds, tableros and other surfaces were painted show changes over time in colors used as representations. The oldest have no representations, just the color red, but after 200 AD, there appear new colors such as different tones of red, as well as green, ochre, blue, black, and brown. Human like figures, animals and geometric shapes begin to appear as well. However, the Mural of the Drinkers is the only preserved mural that depicts human figures. So far, all of the discovered murals have been on outside walls, with the exception of an area called Edificio D (Building D), which has its murals inside. This indicates that most murals were created for the public and probably to teach and reinforce the religious and political symbols of the time. The best conserved murals have been found on the layers inside the main pyramid and in the Courtyard of the Altars, the two most important areas of the site.Rodr√≠guez, pp. 133‚Äì4 The Mural of Drinkers was discovered buried at a depth of almost and is one of the longest pre-Columbian murals found in Mexico, with a total length of . The building containing the Mural of the Drinkers was discovered accidentally in 1969 by Ponciano Salazar Orteg√≥n while he was exploring Edificio 3-1-A. One of this building's taluds collapsed and exposed a portion of the mural behind it to view. Excavation of this building then continued until 1971. The building's main facade, which faces east towards the Courtyard of the Altars, contains the mural. This work also rescued one of the first foundations of Edificio 3. The foundation is formed by a frieze that measures ninety cm by 2.25 m in the best preserved areas. It was painted over a small talud only sixty cm long. It is possible there was a cornice here above it. The building corresponds to around 200 AD. The subject of the mural is a feast, featuring personages drinking what is most likely pulque. Several of the displayed figures are wearing cloth turbans and maxtlatl sashes, and most of them wear zoomorphic masks. The figures sit in facing pairs, serving themselves from vessels placed between them. The subject of the mural is a ceremony where the participants appear relaxed as they realize various activities, which include drinking, making offerings, serving with one vomiting and one defecating. The figures are in vignettes along the strip of wall with the elements evenly distributed along its length. A number of the elements, such as the cups and jars, are associated with the drinking of pulque.Rodr√≠guez, pp. 136‚Äì7. It has been claimed by Florencia Muller that this mural is the oldest known representation of the ritual of the pulque gods. The work has parts missing, but there is enough to discern three horizontal sections. The ones above and below are lines or borders framing the main central level containing the drinking figures. The mural divides into six \\"walls\\" (muros), which show differences in technique and content, most likely due to being the work of different artists. However, all relate to ritualistic drinking of pulque.Rodr√≠guez, p. 138. These figures along the center are then divided into two sections by a blue band seen on walls 3, 4, 5 and 6. There is also evidence that the mural had been retouched several times. The mural contains 110 figures organized into pairs. The pairs are then separated by images of jars. Four can be identified as seated women and some of the figures appear to have wrinkles to depict age. Most of the men in the work are shown seated, facing front (but with faces in profile) with a bulging belly, with arms and legs in various positions, most with cups or other containers in hand to serve or to drink. There are a total of 168 jars, cups and other containers in the mural of various sizes and colors. There is also a depiction of an insect and two of dogs. The people are outlined in black, along with a number of other images. Most have their skin painted in ochre, but some are brown, red or black. Traces of liquid is in white. Some have earrings done in red or blue. However, there are some differences in quality and technique in the work. Section Six is more masterfully done, with the people depicted in masks painted in red and black with some ochre. Dogs and jars with complex designs can also be seen. Scene One is more brusque with far fewer details, mostly done in ochre.Rodr√≠guez, p. 137. Other buildings in this area such as the later levels of Building 3 and Building 4, also have mural work, but this mostly consists of geometric patterns, lines or bands and in some places, stars. Building 3-1-A was superimposed over the Mural of the Drinkers at a depth of six meters below the current level of the Courtyard of the Altars. The section where this mural work is found consists of a long talud, with a tablero with double moldings, similar to those in Buildings 2, 3, and 4. The mural occupies the tablero, which is topped by a double cornice. The design consists of diagonal bands of various colors such as red, green yellow and blue, outlined in black and white. Some sections contains stars. Building 3-1 was built over the second level of the building containing the Mural of the Drinkers, running north south, and facing northeast like the older structure. It is one of the oldest borders of the Plaza Sureste and only two sections have been explored. It is sixty meters long but only about thirty is exposed. The visible area divides into three sections, divided by stairways. The upper part of this building, where the stairs lead, has a low talud that supports a frieze topped by a cornice, which juts out. This building contains mural work on a tablero measuring 71 cm by 2.6 meters in length, but there is no evidence of painting on the talud. The first mural consists of horizontal bands in a reddish ochre and a hook like design in red surrounded by an ellipsis in the same tone over a black background. Others consist of diagonal bands of greens and reds bordered and connected by black lines simulating a woven mat, which has led to it being called the \\"Petatillo\\" (small palm frond mat). The lower areas have diagonal lines of various colors such as black, green, ochre and red with some lines in white. Some areas have red stars. Mural work on Buildings 3.2 and 4 are similar in their use of multicolored diagonal bands with stars painted in some areas.Rodr√≠guez, pp. 152‚Äì4. =Building D= Building D is located on the south side of the Pyramid of the Nine Stories. It consists of pyramid like levels of talud-tablero topped with three moldings on the east and two on the west. The levels are rectangles with rounded corners, painted black on three sides with the east side in orange. The murals on the tableros have no figures on them and the cornices are painted black. The building was constructed over an area, whose interior is covered with stone pieces with red, ochre and green paint over black. This area was filled in because later constructions around it were putting pressure on it and it was in danger of collapse.Rodr√≠guez, p 136. =Building I= Building I was unearthed during a brief period of six months at the beginning of the second round of excavation, mostly by Eduardo Matos Moctezuma and Pablo L√≥pez Vald√©z. This building is located on a platform affixed onto the southwest side of the pyramid. It has four means of access, common to momoztli and contained three burials. The ceramics found with these are similar to those found at the Altar of the Sculpted Skulls, dating the structure as late into Cholula's pre Hispanic period. These two finds show that while the pyramid was in process of abandonment, it had not lost its ritual character.Sol√≠s, pp. 71‚Äì2. =Building F= Building F Building F dates from the next to last building phase of the pyramid, between 500 and 700 AD. It is a stone stairway, consisting of three levels with large taluds facing west. The tableros are decorated with a motif that looks like a woven palm mat. This effect was created by sculpting stones, then placing them like a mosaic. For this reason, the structure is also referred to as the Piedra Laborada (Worked Stone) building. Using stone found from both the taluds and the tableros, the archeologists set about reconstructing this structure, using commercially made cement, leading to the structure being called the Tolteca pyramid, after the brand used. This pyramid has since been criticized for being overly reconstructed. The process yielded a large number of ceramics figurines and vessels, which were studied by Florence M√ºller and range from the Pre Classic to the Postclassic. It has also lost most of its coloration, with only fragments of red, ochre, white and black remaining. The best conserved fragments are on the first level on the south and north where paint was applied directly onto rock. However, it is still difficult to discern the skulls and snails, because they have severely deteriorated.Sol√≠s, pp. 75‚Äì7. Burials During the course of excavations of the Great Pyramid over 400 human burials have been uncovered.Solanes Carraro 1991, p. 7. Most of these burials date to the Postclassic Period, showing that the Great Pyramid was an important centre of worship well after its use as a temple was discontinued. These burials include a number of human sacrifices, as demonstrated by mangled body parts and skulls from decapitated victims. The remains of eight individuals were found under the slab flooring of the Courtyard of Altars. These included the remains of a number of children that were deposited in ceramic pots. These children were (thought to have been) messengers to Tlaloc (the god of rain) due to the drought occurring at this site. The disarticulated remains of at least 46 individuals were found in the area of an altar in the centre of a plaza at the southwest corner of the pyramid. These remains included individuals of all ages and both sexes. Current importance Image of the Virgin of the Remedies of Cholula The pyramid remains important to modern Cholula as a religious site, an archeological site and a tourist attraction. The site receives about 220,000 visitors each year on average. Just before the arrival of the Spanish, the pyramid was considered sacred to a rain goddess called Chiconauhquiauhitl (Goddess of the Nine Rains). She was replaced with an image of the Virgin of the Remedies, keeping the 8 September date for the veneration of the old rain goddess but transferring it to this image of the Virgin Mary.Vazquez, p. 14 The Spanish built a church to this image on top of the pyramid. This church was struck and damaged by lightning several times, which was attributed in the early colonial period to the old goddess. However the change allowed the pyramid to keep its sacred nature to this day. The Virgin of the Remedies is the patron of the city of Cholula, and there are two major annual events related to it and the pyramid. The first is 8 September, when thousands come to honor the image, starting on the night of the 7th, when people spend the night with small lanterns so they can greet the image early on the eighth.Vazquez, p. 15 The other is called the \\"Bajada\\" when the image comes down the pyramid to visit the various neighborhoods of the city for two weeks in May and June.Vazquez, p. 18 Closer to the pyramid's pre-Hispanic roots is the Quetzacoatl ritual, which is held each year on the spring equinox. This event can draw up to 20,000 visitors, leading authorities to restrict access to the exposed archeological ruins on the south side. The ritual is performed on the pyramid with poetry, indigenous dance and music and fireworks. The pyramid site accounts for only six hectares of an archeological heritage site believed to extend over 154 hectares. However, 90 hectares of this land is privately owned, and there is resistance to major archeological exploration. Despite the ancient city's and pyramid's importance to the history of central Mexico, the pyramid has not been extensively studied and has not of yet played a significant role in the understanding of Mesoamerica. Facade of museum entrance The pyramid is the main tourist attraction in Cholula, receiving 496,518 visitors in 2017. Images of this church on top of the pyramid with Popocatepetl in the background is frequently used in Mexico's promotion of tourism. It is one of the better known destinations in central Mexico for foreign travelers. The attraction consists of three parts: the tunnels inside the pyramid, the complex on the south side and the site museum. About eight km of tunnels were dug into the pyramid by archaeologists but only 800 meters are open to the public. The tunnel entrance is on the north side and it goes through the center of the structure. This tour passes by the Mural of the Drinkers, which is one of the most famous aspects of the site. The structures on the south side are dominated by the Courtyard of the Altars. Separated from the site by the Camino Real road is the site museum, which contains a model of the pyramid's layers, a room dedicated to ceramics and other finds from the site and the recreation of two of the site's murals. The pyramid's importance has led to a number of measures taken to protect it. The archaeological zone is patrolled by a police equestrian unit from the municipality of San √Åndres. This to keep motor vehicles from damaging the site. Access to parts of the site is restricted during events such as the Quetzalcoatl Ritual. Certain large fireworks have been banned by the city and the Catholic Church because they cause serious vibrations in the pyramid's tunnels. Some of the land around the pyramid has been bought by authorities and made into soccer fields, and sown with flowers to create a buffer between the construction of homes and the pyramid.

It is the home field of the Asheville Tourists minor league baseball team. As befits the hilly city of Asheville, the ballpark sits on a section of level ground partway up one of the city's hills, providing a picturesque atmosphere. It is the one of the oldest minor-league park in regular use. History The ballpark was built in 1924 and was named after Asheville resident Lewis McCormick; it is one of the oldest minor-league stadiums still in regular use. Lights were installed for nighttime play prior to the 1930 season. Since then, it has been home to the various incarnations of the Asheville Tourists team, and also served as home field for the Asheville Blues of the Negro Southern League during the 1940s. The facility was renovated in 1959, and then rebuilt in concrete between the 1991 and 1992 seasons, replacing the largely wood structure which had developed a leaky roof. The 1992 ballpark kept a similar layout to the original McCormick Field. The facility included new expanded restrooms and larger concession stands. New clubhouses were built and lights erected as player and field enhancements. The height of the fence behind the cozy right field area, which was in the vicinity of just away from home plate, was more than tripled, as it now stands tall (nearly the same height as Fenway Park's \\"Green Monster\\"). 150px Other uses The ballpark served as one of the settings for the 1988 film Bull Durham. The venue hosted the 2009 Big South Conference Baseball Tournament, won by Coastal Carolina. Farther up the hill, behind the left field area, is Asheville Memorial Stadium, a football and soccer facility. Its bleacher seating structure is visible from McCormick Field.

It was published by Strategic Simulations in 1997 using the same game engine of the earlier and successful Panzer General for Windows 95. It was re-released on GOG.com in May 2015. Gameplay Pacific General (also known as \\"PacGen\\") is played on a hex map with icons representing aircraft, warships, tanks, and groups of soldiers. The turn-based style allows each player to strategize their next move. Combat involves various factors, like critical hits, surprise, and terrain. Particular attention is spent on naval warfare, where ships can sustain critical hits to ship systems and submarines can submerge to launch stealth attacks. The weather and time of day are also important factors to consider: darkness can obscure troop movements and rain can prevent airstrikes. Troops can sustain suppression from enemy fire, inhibiting their offensive and defensive abilities, and they can also entrench themselves, enhancing their defensive strength. Players win by amassing victory points that are gained by occupying specific objective hexes. The side with the most victory points is declared the winner. Like role-playing games, the player can upgrade or add units to his core force, with the unit's experience carrying on to the next battle. He also must be aware of each unit's fuel and ammunition levels, and also the fog of war, the collective vision of all units under his control. Prestige is the currency of the game. Prestige is gained by destroying enemy units and lost when a player buys or upgrades his units. Prestige is also available at the start of a new scenario before any combat begins. Whereas the first Panzer General targeted DOS, Pacific General was made for Windows. Pacific General utilize interface and share an underlying file system that differs from the original Panzer General. Fans created a version of Pacific General, based on its own DOS version, that borrows interface features from the original Panzer General. Called Pacific Panzer General (PacPG), it includes all scenarios and campaigns from the original, as well as bugfixes. Nations The player can choose between the Allied and Axis sides in both real and hypothetical scenarios, like the Battle of Midway and Operation Downfall. Thirty-one countries are represented, including the United States, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Soviet Union but only United States and Japan have campaign modes. Each nation has historical weapons available. Units There are several types of unit categories: tanks, infantry, artillery, fighter aircraft, bombers, aircraft carriers, battleships, forts, etc. Infantry and towed weapons may have attached trucks or half-track transports and land units can be moved around the map on cargo ships or cargo planes. Most nations have several units in each category, and many are unique to each nation; the Japanese have kamikazes at their disposal. Each unit has specific entry dates to when they can be available to a player; the U.S. cannot field jet aircraft until the hypothetical invasion of Japan from late 1945 to 1946. Custom Equipment Rosters (referred to as \\"E-Rosters\\") have been made available for this game after initial release by third-party fan sites, increasing the number of units available for each nation as well as improved in-game graphics. Scenarios and campaigns The battles are only approximate representations of historical battles, where only a fraction of the participating forces are included. An Allies (United States) campaign and an Axis (Japan) campaign are included, as well as several other scenarios. A campaign is composed of many scenarios strung together. Similar to other titles in SSI's \\"General\\" series of wargames, players may find themselves commanding forces in hypothetical scenarios if they are much more successful than real-life commanders. For example, if Japanese players attain impressive victories, such as capturing Port Moresby or winning Battle of Midway for Japan, it's possible to invade Australia, Hawaii or even San Francisco, victories that historical Japanese commanders didn't come close to imagining. The player can also create custom scenarios and campaigns, and a battle generator is available. Multiple fan-sites exist offering downloads of additional scenarios and campaigns. The additional user-built campaigns include several German, several American, one Chinese, one Japanese, one Soviet, one British and two Italian campaigns. Reception Like earlier games in the General series, Pacific General sold at least 50,000 units by September 1997.

The show ends in a cavalcade of fireworks as Andrews says \\"Remember...Dreams Come True!\\". After the show the song \\"Remember When\\" performed by LeAnn Rimes is played throughout the park. This song was the official song of the Happiest Homecoming on Earth, celebrating the 50th anniversary of Disneyland and Disney Parks worldwide. For Christmas in 2005, however, while Disneyland opted to continue with Remember... Dreams Come True for the 50th anniversary, the snowfall finale still returned and the song \\"White Christmas\\"; both from Believe... In Holiday Magic; would be played instead of \\"Remember When\\" by LeAnn Rimes with Julie Andrews commenting that the most special time for believing in dreams is during the holidays with family and friends. Show facts Main Street U.S.A. segment of Remember... Dreams Come True * Grand opening: May 1, 2005 The 1,000th performance was on April 15, 2012 * Closing: November 2, 2014 * Show length: 17:11 16:19 after the removal of the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad Segment * Show cost: $33,000 per showing * The music used during the opening and finale of Remember... Dreams Come True originated from Wishes: A Magical Gathering of Disney Dreams at the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Florida, which is performed by Charity Farris. However, the narration is performed by Julie Andrews instead of Jiminy Cricket. * At the conclusion of the display, \\"Remember When,\\" written by Richard Marx and performed by LeAnn Rimes is played throughout the park. Later during the second season of running the fireworks show, a second song, Wishes!, performed by Peabo Bryson and Kimberley Locke (which was from the album Disney Wishes!, an album who proceeds went to the Make-A-Wish Foundation) was added to play after Remember When. After both songs, the lands' normal area loop music returns. * Although Remember When and Wishes! are exit musics of this show, in the past, this portion can be altered due to special occasions:  Prior to introduction of Disney's Celebrate America in 2008, there was special Independence day tag fireworks finale in every July 4th, namely A Salute to America's Golden Dreams, replacing two exit musics in regular version. This theme song was borrowed from Epcot's The American Adventure and Disneyland's Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln attractions. This special show using combination of former Believe and current Remember... pyro equipment.  For the 2005 holiday season, \\"Remember When\\" was replaced with the \\"White Christmas\\" segment of Believe... In Holiday Magic, complete with magical snowfall. This version of the \\"White Christmas\\" segment contained a short introduction by Julie Andrews. * In acknowledgment that Disneyland is now more than 50 years old, current showings feature the following changes to the Julie Andrews narration:  \\"Fifty years ago\\" has been replaced with \\"In 1955\\"  \\"Fifty years later\\" has been dubbed over with the word \\"Today\\" * The show closed November 2, 2014 for the integration of a new fireworks launch system. A special engagement of longtime fireworks spectacular Fantasy in the Sky played in the interim until Disneyland Forever's debut on May 21, 2015. * Coinciding with the limited return of the Main Street Electrical Parade for the Spring 2017 season, the show began a return engagement on February 3, 2017, featuring the searchlights and projection technology developed for Disneyland Forever. * Occasionally shows are canceled due to high winds at high elevations. The shows could be canceled at the beginning or, very rarely, during the show. .  On occasions where it's predetermined that high winds will affect a performance close to showtime, an alternate version is shown. Consisting of the intro and finale, slightly different projections and searchlight choreography are used. This precedent started in 2007 for Believe... in Holiday Magic snowfall finale and in 2015, during Disneyland Forever's engagement. Soundtrack The entire soundtrack to the show can be found on A Musical History of Disneyland and on The Official Album of the Disneyland Resort. The soundtrack reappeared on the Official Album for the Year of a Million Dreams with new narration to coincide with the end of the 50th Anniversary. The score was arranged by Greg Smith. This fireworks show was also used during the 2006 and 2007 Grad Nite programs - the show itself remained almost unchanged except for the soundtrack being replaced with one consisting primarily of contemporary music (different each year) and projection to match it. The show is renamed to Grad Nite Explosion for these events and runs for approximately 10 minutes at 1:00am and 3:00am. Video screens along with additional lighting effects are also added on either side of the hub (already in place as part of Club KIIS).

Bush White House, January 2009) ( ; born December 13, 1953) is an American economist at the Brookings Institution who served two terms as Chair of the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, from 2006 to 2014. During his tenure as chair, Bernanke oversaw the Federal Reserve's response to the late-2000s financial crisis. Before becoming Federal Reserve chair, Bernanke was a tenured professor at Princeton University and chaired the department of economics there from 1996 to September 2002, when he went on public service leave. From August 5, 2002, until June 21, 2005, he was a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, proposed the Bernanke Doctrine, and first discussed \\"the Great Moderation\\" ‚Äî the theory that traditional business cycles have declined in volatility in recent decades through structural changes that have occurred in the international economy, particularly increases in the economic stability of developing nations, diminishing the influence of macroeconomic (monetary and fiscal) policy. Bernanke then served as chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers before President Bush nominated him to succeed Alan Greenspan as chairman of the United States Federal Reserve. His first term began February 1, 2006. Bernanke was confirmed for a second term as chairman on January 28, 2010, after being renominated by President Barack Obama, who later referred to him as \\"the epitome of calm.\\" His second term ended January 31, 2014, when he was succeeded by Janet Yellen on February 3, 2014. Bernanke wrote about his time as chairman of the Federal Reserve in his 2015 book, The Courage to Act, in which he revealed that the world's economy came close to collapse in 2007 and 2008. Bernanke asserts that it was only the novel efforts of the Fed (cooperating with other agencies and agencies of foreign governments) that prevented an economic catastrophe greater than the Great Depression. Family and childhood Bernanke was born in Augusta, Georgia, and was raised on East Jefferson Street in Dillon, South Carolina. His father Philip was a pharmacist and part-time theater manager. His mother Edna was an elementary school teacher.Wessel, David. In Fed We Trust: Ben Bernanke's War on the Great Panic (New York: Crown Business, 2009), p. 69. Bernanke has two younger siblings. His brother, Seth, is a lawyer in Charlotte, North Carolina. His sister, Sharon, is a longtime administrator at Berklee College of Music in Boston. The Bernankes were one of the few Jewish families in Dillon and attended Ohav Shalom, a local synagogue; Bernanke learned Hebrew as a child from his maternal grandfather, Harold Friedman, a professional hazzan (service leader), shochet, and Hebrew teacher. Bernanke's father and uncle owned and managed a drugstore they purchased from Bernanke's paternal grandfather, Jonas Bernanke. Jonas Bernanke was born in Boryslav, Austria-Hungary (today part of Ukraine), on January 23, 1891. He immigrated to the United States from Przemy≈õl, Austria-Hungary (today part of Poland) and arrived at Ellis Island, aged 30, on June 30, 1921, with his wife Pauline, aged 25. On the ship's manifest, Jonas's occupation is listed as \\"clerk\\" and Pauline's as \\"doctor med\\". The family moved to Dillon from New York in the 1940s. Bernanke's mother gave up her job as a schoolteacher when her son was born and worked at the family drugstore. Ben Bernanke also worked there sometimes. =Young adult= As a teenager, Bernanke worked construction on a hospital and waited tables at a restaurant at nearby South of the Border, a roadside attraction, amusement park and fireworks retailer, in his hometown of Dillon, before leaving for college. To support himself throughout college, he continued to work during the summers at South of the Border. =Religion= As a teenager in the 1960s, Bernanke would help roll the Torah scrolls in his local synagogue. Although he keeps his beliefs private, his friend Mark Gertler, chairman of New York University's economics department, says they are \\"embedded in who he (Bernanke) is.\\" Once Bernanke was at Harvard for his freshman year, Fellow Dillon native Kenneth Manning took him to Brookline for Rosh Hashanah services.Wessel, David.

Martin Junior High, and Dillon High School, where he was class valedictorian and played saxophone in the marching band.Wessel, David (2009), In Fed We Trust: Ben Bernanke's War on the Great Panic, New York: Crown Business, p. 70. Since Dillon High School did not offer calculus at the time, Bernanke taught it to himself. Bernanke scored 1590 out of 1600 on the SAT and was a National Merit Scholar. He also was a contestant in the 1965 National Spelling Bee.White, Ben (15 November 2005).

He received a Ph.D. degree in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1979 after completing and defending his dissertation, Long-Term Commitments, Dynamic Optimization, and the Business Cycle. Bernanke's thesis adviser was the future governor of the Bank of Israel, Stanley Fischer, and his readers included Irwin S.

He chaired that department from 1996 until September 2002, when he went on public service leave. He resigned his position at Princeton July 1, 2005. Bernanke served as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from 2002 to 2005. In one of his first speeches as a Governor, entitled \\"Deflation: Making Sure It Doesn't Happen Here\\", he outlined what has been referred to as the Bernanke Doctrine. As a member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System on February 20, 2004, Bernanke gave a speech in which he postulated that we are in a new era called the Great Moderation, where modern macroeconomic policy has decreased the volatility of the business cycle to the point that it should no longer be a central issue in economics.Krugman, Paul R. (2009). The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008. Norton & Company. p. 10. In June 2005, Bernanke was named chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, and resigned as Fed Governor. The appointment was largely viewed as a test run to ascertain if Bernanke could be Bush's pick to succeed Greenspan as Fed chairman the next year.Andrews, Edmund L.; Leonhardt, David; Porter, Eduardo; Uchitelle, Louis (October 26, 2005), \\"At the Fed, an Unknown Became a Safe Choice\\", The New York Times.

Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve Bernanke testifying before the House Financial Services Committee responding to a question on February 10, 2009. On February 1, 2006, Bernanke began a fourteen- year term as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and a four- year term as chairman (after having been nominated by President Bush in late 2005). By virtue of the chairmanship, he sat on the Financial Stability Oversight Board that oversees the Troubled Asset Relief Program. He also served as chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee, the System's principal monetary policy making body. His first months as chairman of the Federal Reserve System were marked by difficulties communicating with the media. An advocate of more transparent Fed policy and clearer statements than Greenspan had made, he had to back away from his initial idea of stating clearer inflation goals as such statements tended to affect the stock market. Maria Bartiromo disclosed on CNBC comments from their private conversation at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner. She reported that Bernanke said investors had misinterpreted his comments as indicating that he was \\"dovish\\" on inflation. He was sharply criticized for making public statements about Fed direction, which he said was a \\"lapse in judgment.\\" = Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008= Bernanke (left) in September 2008 as President Bush speaks about the economy As the Great Recession deepened, Bernanke oversaw some unorthodox measures. Under his guidance, the Fed lowered its funds interest rate from 5.25% to 0.0% within less than a year. When this was considered insufficient to abate the liquidity crisis, the Fed initiated quantitative easing, creating $1.3 trillion from November 2008 to June 2010 and using the created money to buy financial assets from banks and from the government. = Second term = FOMC press conference On August 25, 2009, President Obama announced he would nominate Bernanke to a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve. In a short statement on Martha's Vineyard, with Bernanke standing at his side, Obama said Bernanke's background, temperament, courage and creativity helped to prevent another Great Depression in 2008. When Senate Banking Committee hearings on his nomination began on December 3, 2009, several senators from both parties indicated they would not support a second term. However, Bernanke was confirmed for a second term as chairman on January 28, 2010, by a 70‚Äì30 vote of the full Senate, the narrowest margin, at the time, for any occupant of the position. (For the roll-call vote, see Obama confirmations, 2010.) The Senate first voted 77‚Äì23 to end debate, Bernanke winning more than the 60 approval votes needed to overcome the possibility of a filibuster. On a second vote to confirm, the 30 dissents came from 11 Democrats, 18 Republicans and one independent. Bernanke was succeeded as chair of the Federal Reserve by Janet Yellen, the first woman to hold the position. Yellen was nominated on October 9, 2013, by President Obama and confirmed by the United States Senate on January 6, 2014. Controversies as Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke has been subjected to criticism concerning the late-2000s financial crisis. According to The New York Times, Bernanke \\"has been attacked for failing to foresee the financial crisis, for bailing out Wall Street, and, most recently, for injecting an additional $600 billion into the banking system to give the slow recovery a boost.\\" =Merrill Lynch merger with Bank of America= In a letter to Congress from then-New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo dated April 23, 2009, Bernanke was mentioned along with former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in allegations of fraud concerning the acquisition of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America. The letter alleged that the extent of the losses at Merrill Lynch were not disclosed to Bank of America by Bernanke and Paulson. When Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis informed Paulson that Bank of America was exiting the merger by invoking the \\"Materially Adverse Change\\" (MAC) clause, Paulson immediately called Lewis to a meeting in Washington. At the meeting, which allegedly took place on December 21, 2008, Paulson told Lewis that he and the board would be replaced if they invoked the MAC clause and additionally not to reveal the extent of the losses to shareholders. Paulson stated to Cuomo's office that he was directed by Bernanke to threaten Lewis in this manner. Congressional hearings into these allegations were conducted on June 25, 2009, with Bernanke testifying that he did not bully Ken Lewis. Under intense questioning by members of Congress, Bernanke said, \\"I never said anything about firing the board and the management [of Bank of America].\\" In further testimony, Bernanke said the Fed did nothing illegal or unethical in its efforts to convince Bank of America not to end the merger. Lewis told the panel that authorities expressed \\"strong views\\" but said he would not characterize their stance as improper.\\"Lawmakers hit out at Paulson over BofA- Merrill\\". Reuters. July 16, 2009 =AIG bailout= According to a January 26, 2010, column in The Huffington Post, a whistleblower has disclosed documents providing troubling details' of Bernanke's role in the AIG bailout\\". Republican Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky said on CNBC that he had seen documents which show that Bernanke overruled recommendations from his staff in bailing out AIG. The columnist says this raises questions as to whether or not the decision to bail out AIG was necessary. Senators from both parties who support Bernanke say his actions averted worse problems and outweigh whatever responsibility he may have for the financial crisis.Grim, Ryan (January 27, 2010), \\"Is Bernanke Hiding A Smoking Gun?\\", The Huffington Post =Edward Quince= The crisis in 2008 also made then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke create a pseudonym, Edward Quince. According to the Wall Street Journal, the false name was evidence in a class-action lawsuit against the government by shareholders of AIG, which had been given a Fed-backed bailout when it was near collapse. One of Mr. Quince's emails reads, \\"We think they are days from failure. They think it is a temporary problem. This disconnect is dangerous.\\"Paletta, Damian (October 9, 2014), \\"Meet Edward Quince, the Secret Federal Reserve Chairman in 2008\\", Wall Street Journal, Upon the revelation of the Quince pseudonym during the Starr v. United States trial, The New York Times created a cocktail inspired by Mr. Bernanke's chosen alias: the \\"Rye & Quince.\\" Economic views With his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, looking on, Chairman Ben Bernanke addresses President George W. Bush and others after being sworn into the Federal Reserve post. Also on stage with the President are Mrs. Anna Bernanke and Roger W. Ferguson, Jr., Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Bernanke has given several lectures at the London School of Economics on monetary theory and policy. He has written two textbooks: an intermediate-level macroeconomics textbook coauthored with Andrew Abel (and also Dean Croushore in later editions) and an introductory textbook, covering both microeconomics and macroeconomics, coauthored with Robert H. Frank. Bernanke was the Director of the Monetary Economics Program of the National Bureau of Economic Research and the editor of the American Economic Review. He is among the 50 most published economists in the world according to IDEAS/RePEc. Bernanke is particularly interested in the economic and political causes of the Great Depression, on which he has published numerous academic journal articles. Before Bernanke's work, the dominant monetarist theory of the Great Depression was Milton Friedman's view that it had been largely caused by the Federal Reserve's having reduced the money supply and has on several occasions argued that one of the biggest mistakes made during the period was to raise interest rates too early. In a speech on Milton Friedman's ninetieth birthday (November 8, 2002), Bernanke said: > \\"Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official > representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton and > Anna [Schwartz, Friedman's coauthor]: Regarding the Great Depression, you're > right. We did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it > again.\\"FRB Speech: Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke, At the Conference to > Honor Milton Friedman, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, November 8, > 2002 Bernanke has cited Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz in his decision to lower interest rates to zero. Anna Schwartz, however, was highly critical of Bernanke and wrote an opinion piece in The New York Times advising Obama against his reappointment as chair of the Federal Reserve. Bernanke focused less on the role of the Federal Reserve and more on the role of private banks and financial institutions.Bernanke, Ben S., \\"Non-Monetary Effects of the Financial Crisis in the Propagation of the Great Depression\\", American Economic Review, 73 (June 1983), pp. 257‚Äì76. Bernanke found that the financial disruptions of 1930‚Äì33 reduced the efficiency of the credit allocation process; and that the resulting higher cost and reduced availability of credit acted to depress aggregate demand, identifying an effect he called the financial accelerator. When faced with a mild downturn, banks are likely to significantly cut back lending and other risky ventures. This further hurts the economy, creating a vicious cycle and potentially turning a mild recession into a major depression. Economist Brad DeLong, who had previously advocated his own theory for the Great Depression, notes that the global financial crisis of 2008‚Äì2009 has raised the pertinence of Bernanke's theory.Brad DeLong. \\"Lecture 10: Depressions and Panics, 1840‚Äì1933 \\" Economics 113 ‚Äì American Economic History UC Berkeley In 2002, following coverage of concerns about deflation in the business news, Bernanke gave a speech about the topic. In that speech, he mentioned that the government in a fiat money system owns the physical means of creating money and to maintain market liquidity. Control of the money supply implies that the government can always avoid deflation by simply issuing more money. He said \\"The U.S. government has a technology, called a printing press (or today, its electronic equivalent), that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at no cost.\\" He referred to a statement made by Milton Friedman about using a \\"helicopter drop\\" of money into the economy to fight deflation. Bernanke's critics have since referred to him as \\"Helicopter Ben\\" or to his \\"helicopter printing press.\\" In a footnote to his speech, Bernanke noted that \\"people know that inflation erodes the real value of the government's debt and, therefore, that it is in the interest of the government to create some inflation.\\" For example, while Greenspan publicly supported President Clinton's deficit reduction plan and the Bush tax cuts, Bernanke, when questioned about taxation policy, said that it was none of his business, his exclusive remit being monetary policy, and said that fiscal policy and wider society related issues were what politicians were for and got elected for. But Bernanke has been identified by The Wall Street Journal and a close colleague as a \\"libertarian-Republican\\" in the mold of Alan Greenspan. In 2005 Bernanke coined the term saving glut, the idea that relatively high level of worldwide savings was holding down interest rates and financing the current account deficits of the United States. (Alternative reasons include relatively low worldwide investment coupled with low U.S. savings.) As the recession began in 2007, many economists urged Bernanke (and the rest of the Federal Open Market Committee) to lower the federal funds rate below what it had done. For example, Larry Summers, later named Director of the White House's National Economic Council under President Obama, wrote in the Financial Times on November 26, 2007‚Äîin a column in which he argued that recession was likely‚Äîthat \\"... maintaining demand must be the macro-economic priority. That means the Federal Reserve System has to get ahead of the curve and recognize‚Äîas the market already has‚Äîthat levels of the Federal Funds rate that were neutral when the financial system was working normally are quite contractionary today.\\" David Leonhardt of The New York Times wrote, on January 30, 2008, that \\"Dr. Bernanke's forecasts have been too sunny over the last six months. [On] the other hand, his forecast was a lot better than Wall Street's in mid-2006. Back then, he resisted calls for further interest rate increases because he thought the economy might be weakening.\\" After the Federal Reserve In a speech at the American Economics Association conference in January 2014, Bernanke reflected on his tenure as chairman of the Federal Reserve. He expressed his hope that economic growth was building momentum and stated that he was confident that the central bank would be able to withdraw its support smoothly. In an October 2014 speech, Bernanke disclosed that he was unsuccessful in efforts to refinance his home. He suggested that lenders \\"may have gone a little bit too far on mortgage credit conditions\\". Since February 2014, Bernanke has been employed as a Distinguished Fellow in Residence with the Economic Studies Program at the Brookings Institution. On April 16, 2015, it was announced publicly that Bernanke will work with Citadel, the $25 billion hedge fund founded by billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin, as a senior adviser. In the same month it was revealed that Bernanke would also join Pimco as a senior advisor. In his 2015 book, 'The Courage to Act', Bernanke revealed that he was no longer a Republican, having \\"lost patience with Republicans' susceptibility to the know-nothing-ism of the far right. ... I view myself now as a moderate independent, and I think that's where I'll stay.\\" Statements on deficit reduction and reform of Social Security/Medicare Bernanke favors reducing the U.S. budget deficit, particularly by reforming the Social Security and Medicare entitlement programs. During a speech delivered on April 7, 2010, he warned that the U.S. must soon develop a \\"credible\\" plan to address the pending funding crisis faced by \\"entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare\\" or \\"in the longer run we will have neither financial stability nor healthy economic growth.\\"Bernanke, Ben S., \\"Economic Challenges: Past, Present and Future (PDF version)\\" (see pages 13‚Äì14 of the speech transcript).

Bernanke said that formulation of such a plan would help the economy in the near term, even if actual implementation of the plan might have to wait until the economic outlook improves. His remarks were most likely intended for the federal government's executive and legislative branches, since entitlement reform is a fiscal exercise that will be accomplished by the Congress and the President rather than a monetary task falling within the implementation powers of the Federal Reserve. Bernanke also pointed out that deficit reduction will necessarily consist of either raising taxes, cutting entitlement payments and other government spending, or some combination of both.

These dependent relationships are tied to the order in which different statements access memory locations. Using the analysis of these relationships, execution of the loop can be organized to allow multiple processors to work on different portions of the loop in parallel. This is known as parallel processing. In general, loops can consume a lot of processing time when executed as serial code. Through parallel processing, it is possible to reduce the total execution time of a program through sharing the processing load among multiple processors. The process of organizing statements to allow multiple processors to work on different portions of a loop is often referred to as parallelization. In order to see how we can exploit parallelization, we have to first analyze the dependencies within individual loops. These dependencies will help determine which statements in the loop need to be completed before other statements can start, and which statements in the loop can be executed in parallel with respect to the other statements in the loop. Two general categories of dependencies that will be analyzed in the loop are data dependencies and control dependencies.  Description  Loop dependence analysis occur on a normalized loop of the form: for i1 until U1 do for i2 until U2 do ... for in until Un do body done done done where body may contain: S1 a[f1(i1, ..., in), ..., fm(i1, ..., in)] := ... ... S2 ... := a[h1(i1, ..., in), ..., hm(i1, ..., in)] Where a is an m-dimensional array and fn, hn, etc. are functions mapping from all iteration indexes (in) to a memory access in a particular dimension of the array. For example, in C: for (i = 0; i < U1; i++) for (j = 0; j < U2; j++) a[i+4-j] = b[2*i-j] + i*j; f1 would be i+4-j, controlling the write on the first dimension of a and h2 would be 2*i-j, controlling the read on the first dimension of b. The scope of the problem is to find all possible dependencies between S1 and S2. To be conservative, any dependence which cannot be proven false must be assumed to be true. Independence is shown by demonstrating that no two instances of S1 and S2 access or modify the same spot in array a. When a possible dependence is found, loop dependence analysis usually makes every attempt to characterize the relationship between dependent instances, as some optimizations may still be possible. It may also be possible to transform the loop to remove or modify the dependence. In the course of (dis)proving such dependencies, a statement S may be decomposed according to which iteration it comes from. For instance, S[1,3,5] refers to the iteration where i1 = 1, i2 = 3 and i3 = 5. Of course, references to abstract iterations, such as S[d1+1,d2,d3], are both permitted and common.  Data dependence  Data dependencies show the relationships between the variables in the code. There are three different types of data dependencies: * True Dependence (sometimes referred to a Flow Dependence) * Anti Dependence * Output Dependence = True dependence = A true dependence occurs when a location in memory is written to before it is read. It introduces read-after-write (RAW) hazards because the instruction that reads from the location in memory has to wait until it is written to by the previous instruction or else the reading instruction will read the wrong value. An example of a true dependence is: S1: a = 5; S2: b = a; In this example, there is a true dependence between S1 and S2 because variable a is first written in statement S1 and then variable a is read by statement S2. This true dependence can be represented by S1 ‚ÜíT S2. A true dependence can also be seen when reading and writing between different iterations in a loop. The following example shows a true dependence between different iterations. for(j = 1; j < n; j++) S1: a[j] = a[j-1]; In this example, a true dependence exists between statement S1 in the jth iteration and S1 in the j+1th iteration. There is a true dependence because a value will be written to a[j] in one iteration and then a read occurs by a[j-1] in the next iteration. This true dependence can be represented by S1[j] ‚ÜíT S1[j+1]. = Anti dependence = An anti dependence occurs when a location in memory is read before that same location is written to. This introduces write-after-read (WAR) hazards because the instruction that writes the data into a memory location has to wait until that memory location has been read by the previous instruction or else the reading instruction would read the wrong value. An example of an anti dependence is: S1: a = b; S2: b = 5; In this example, there is an anti dependence between statements S1 and S2. This is an anti dependence because variable b is first read in statement S1 and then variable b is written to in statement S2. This can be represented by S1 ‚ÜíA S2. An anti dependence can be seen by different iterations in a loop. The following example shows an example of this case: for(j = 0; j < n; j++) S1: b[j] = b[j+1]; In this example, there is an anti dependence between the jth iteration of S1 and the j+1th element of S1. Here, the j+1th element is read before that same element is written in the next iteration of j. This anti dependence can be represented by S1[j] ‚ÜíA S1[j+1]. = Output dependence = An output dependence occurs when a location in memory is written to before that same location is written to again in another statement. This introduces write- after-write(WAW) hazards because the second instruction to write the value to a memory location needs to wait until the first instruction finishes writing data to the same memory location or else when the memory location is read at a later time it will contain the wrong value. An example of an output dependence is: S1: c = 8; S2: c = 15; In this example, there is an output dependence between statements S1 and S2. Here, the variable c is first written to in S1 and then variable c is written to again in statement S2. This output dependence can be represented by S1 ‚ÜíO S2. An output dependence can be seen by different iterations in a loop. The following code snippet shows an example of this case: for(j = 0; j < n; j++) S1: c[j] = j; S2: c[j+1] = 5; In this example, there is an output dependence between the jth element in S1 and the j+1th element in S2. Here, c[j+1] in statement S2 is written to in one iteration. In the next iteration, c[j] in statement S2, which is the same memory location as c[j+1] in the previous iteration, is written to again. This output dependence can be represented as S1[j] ‚ÜíO S2[j+1].  Control dependence  Control dependencies must also be considered when analyzing dependencies between different statements in a loop. Control dependencies are dependencies introduced by the code or the programming algorithm itself. They control the order in which instructions occur within the execution of code. One common example is an \\"if\\" statement. \\"if\\" statements create branches in a program. The \\"then\\" portion of the \\"if\\" statement explicitly directs or controls actions to be taken. // Code block 1 (CORRECT) // Code block 2 (INCORRECT) // Code block 3 (INCORRECT) if (a  b) then { if (a  b) then { if (a  b) then { c = \\"controlled\\"; } c = \\"controlled\\"; } c = \\"controlled\\"; d = \\"not controlled\\"; d = \\"not controlled\\"; d = \\"not controlled\\"; }In this example, the constraints on control flow are illustrated. Code block 1 shows the correct ordering when using an if statement in the C programming language. Code block 2 illustrates a problem where a statement that is supposed to be controlled by the if statement is no longer controlled by it. Code block 3 illustrates a problem where a statement that is not supposed to be controlled by the \\"if\\" statement has now been moved under its control. Both of these two possibilities could lead to improper program execution and must be considered when parallelizing these statements within a loop.  Loop-carried dependence vs. loop independent dependence  Loop-carried dependencies and loop independent dependencies are determined by the relationships between statements in iterations of a loop. When a statement in one iteration of a loop depends in some way on a statement in a different iteration of the same loop, a loop-carried dependence exists. However, if a statement in one iteration of a loop depends only on a statement in the same iteration of the loop, this creates a loop independent dependence. // Code block 1 // Code block 2 for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) S1: b[i] = 8; S1: b[i] = 8; S2: a[i] = b[i-1] + 10; S2: a[i] = b[i] + 10;In this example, code block 1 shows loop-dependent dependence between statement S2 iteration i and statement S1 iteration i-1. This is to say that statement S2 cannot proceed until statement S1 in the previous iteration finishes. Code block 2 show loop independent dependence between statements S1 and S2 in the same iteration.  Loop-carried dependence and iteration space traversal graphs  Iteration space traversal graphs (ITG) shows the path that the code takes when traversing through the iterations of the loop. Each iteration is represented with a node. Loop carried dependence graphs (LDG) gives a visual representation of all true dependencies, anti dependencies, and output dependencies that exist between different iterations in a loop.

Root was born on a Massachusetts farm and worked as a bobbin boy in a cotton mill before switching, at the age of 15, to working in a machine shop in Ware, Massachusetts. At age 24 he was hired by Connecticut industrialist Samuel W. Collins to work in his axe factory in Collinsville, a village of Canton, Connecticut. According to historian Diana Muir writing in Reflections in Bullough's Pond,. Root \\"reconceptualized\\" the making of axes. Until his invention, axes were made by \\"flattening wrought iron, folding it around a steel pin, and forging the two sides together under a trip hammer.\\" Root arranged \\"a series of dies and rollers that could 'die forge' -or apply pressure to a mold, forming a piece of hot wrought iron into the shape of an ax, with an eye already punched to receive the handle.\\" According to Muir, Root next automated the tempering of axes by inventing a machine that moved ax heads through a temperature-regulated oven on a rotating wheel. And a machine that \\"shaved\\" the axes to give them a sharp edge, so that they needed only a small amount of finishing on a grindstone.. In 1849 Samuel Colt hired Root to come work in his Hartford firearms factory as a superintendent. Root performed this role with great success, developing many star employees., pp. 168‚Äì170. It was while working for Colt that Root perfected the Lincoln miller milling machine, 150,000 of which were sold in the late 19th century, making it the most important American machine tool of the era. He modernized firearms production at Colt by designing state of the art drop hammers, boring machines, gauges, jigs, etc. Root also improved the milling machine invented by Simeon North and improved by the Robbins and Lawrence Company of Vermont and by Francis A. Pratt of the George S. Lincoln company in Hartford, Connecticut. The improved tool was known as the Lincoln Miller. The Colt Model 1855 Sidehammer Pocket Revolver, or Colt Root Revolver, was named in honor of the engineer, and saw use during the American Civil War.

It is performed most often as a solitary concert dance by amateur and professional Ukrainian dance ensembles, as well as other performers of folk dances. It has also been incorporated into larger artistic opuses such as operas, ballets and theatre. The hopak is often popularly referred to as the \\"National Dance of Ukraine\\" and has become very popular among Slavic countries, in particular Russia, Belarus and Poland. There are similar folkloric dance tunes known as Sirmpa in Leros, Greece.  Etymology  The name hopak is derived from the verb hopaty () which means \\"to jump,\\" as well as the corresponding exclamation hop! () which can be uttered during a jump as an expression of surprise or amazement. It is also referred to as gopak from the Russian form.  History  = Medieval history = The Hopak developed initially as a Cossack social dance (, translit. pobutovi tantsi), and was practiced in the lands of present-day Ukraine beginning in the 16th century. While the militaristic Zaporizhian Sich generally frowned upon amusements and diversions from military training, such regulations were overlooked when Kozaks returned victorious after battle. Kobzars and other musicians would gather their instruments - violins, bagpipes, bandura, cimbaloms, and fifes - while other participants would dance. Hopak (a late, unfinished painting by Ilya Repin) These celebratory hopaky were performed only by male participants, as they took place in an all-male environment. The performers were young, boisterous mercenaries, and not professional dancers; as such, the dance steps performed were predominantly improvisational, reflecting the performers' sense of manliness, heroism, speed and strength. The steps exhibited included many acrobatic jumps (, translit. strybky). Often fights from the battlefield would be re-enacted in pantomime, with real swords, lances or other weaponry, as the performer lashed out at invisible enemies. These dances were not tied down to specific rhythms, and the dancers could change tempo at any point. Such festive dancing differed greatly in character from the older ritual dances (, translit. obryadovi tantsi), such as the Khorovod, which had previously been the dominant choreographic works in Ruthenian lands. A primary distinction was the gender of the participants ‚Äì all male ‚Äì as opposed to the predominantly all-female ritual dances. With the elevation of Kozak status in the region, hopaky began to appear in the villages within their domain. Unlike the all-male dances found in the Sich, these dances were mixed, with young boys and girls dancing celebratory movements together. While the lead role was retained by male performers, structural elements began to be added in, such as circle forms and pairs moving together in formation; these developments most likely were derived from the choreographic history of ritual dances in the area. None of the dances performed by Kozaks during this time were ever recorded. Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan recorded the fact that Kozaks danced in such a manner, and other historical accounts verify this. Later, Ivan Kotliarevsky and Taras Shevchenko incorporated the Hopak and dancing Kozaks into their works. However, with the destruction of the Sich in the 18th century, the dance survived only in its mixed-gender village format as a celebratory dance. = Concert dance = Hopak - a soviet short film (1931) After Hopak-like dances began to be performed on stage in the 18th century in Serf and Peasant theaters, professional dramatic troupes began to incorporate this popular dance into their repertoire. These performances only incorporated the Hopak into a larger opus, such as Kotliarevsky's operetta Natalka Poltavka. It was the pioneering work of a performer in a dramatic ensemble, the ethnochoreologist Vasyl Verkhovynets, in the early 20th century, that enable the dance to develop into its current format. Verkhovynets' initial work entailed gathering authentic village steps throughout central Ukraine and constructing dances which more accurately represented the Ukrainian cultural tradition. His break-through, however, was demonstrating that staged Ukrainian dance could exist as a distinct performing art, in the form of concert dance. He and his disciple Vasyl Avramenko began staging performances throughout western Ukraine, forming troupes of dancers in village after village. In the spring of 1935, the All- Union Organization of Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries agreed to send a delegation to the upcoming First International Festival of the Folk Dance in London. Verkhovynets worked with Leonid Zhukov of the T. Shevchenko Kyiv Opera and Ballet, and professional dancers from both the Kyiv and Kharkiv Opera houses, on constructing a suite to represent the Ukrainian SSR. For his part, Verkhovynets choreographed what became known as the \\"London Hopak\\" (, translit. londonskiy hopak): this was a 3-part dance, consisting of a men's dance (much like the original Kozak dance), a second, slower segment danced only by women, and finally a rousing closing with both male and female dancers sharing the stage. This dance, along with Zhukov's addition, won the first prize at the festival that summer. The 3-part Hopak was later reprised in September back in Ukraine as part of the opera, Zaporozhets za Dunayem. The format of the 3-part Hopak was subsequently adopted by many professional folk dance ensembles who have choreographed their own variants of Hopak through the years. In 1990, twenty members of the State Folk Dance Ensemble of the Ukrainian SSR, split off and created the Hopak! Ukrainian Dance Company, Ukraine's first independent professional dance company, under the direction of Sergei Makarov.  Dance steps  squatting sequences The modern-day Hopak is a choreographed dance made to appear full of improvisation. Much of the seemingly improvised parts involve solo dancers, usually male, performing visually and technically amazing acrobatic feats. These include jumps and spins and are usually the highlight of the performance. The rest of the dance includes many movements performed in unison, especially by the female dancers, while male dancers typically perform squat sequences. Because of the speed and energy required to perform a successful Hopak, this dance is usually performed at the end of a program. As in many Ukrainian dances, the dancers, especially the women, do not stop moving until the end of the dance.  Hopak music  Music for the Hopak is not standardized by tempo or melody, although time predominates most arrangements. The dance is supposed to evoke a sense of improvisation, so the pace of the music changes from segment to segment, allowing dancers to distinguish themselves. The melodies of the songs Hop, moyi hrechanyky () and Vid Kyiva do Lubny () can be found in many Hopak arrangements. Hopaks usually end on a fast and furious pace, with some incorporating boisterous Ukrainian marches, such as Zasvystaly kozachen'ky (). A number of composers have composed a Hopak as part of an opera or ballet: ;Operas *Modest Mussorgsky, in The Fair at Sorochyntsi *Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, in Mazepa *Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov, in May Night *Semen Hulak- Artemovsky, in Zaporozhets za Dunayem ;Ballets * Aram Khachaturian, in Gayane * Vasily Solovyov-Sedoi, in Taras Bulba * Cesare Pugni, in The Little Humpbacked Horse * Anatoliy Sviechnikov, in Marusia Bohuslavka  In other fields  Soviet leader Joseph Stalin once famously forced his eventual successor Nikita Khrushchev (who had been the Communist Party chief in Ukraine) to dance the Hopak. The Hopak was performed as a part of the choreographic suite Friendship of Peoples by dancers in Ukrainian folk costumes during the opening ceremony of the 1980 Summer Olympics. This event took place on the field of the Central Lenin Stadium, with a large section of the tribune under the Olympic Flame Cauldron coloured in Ukrainian folk patterns during the performance.Documentary: \\"–û–ª–∏–º–ø–∏–∞–¥–∞ ‚Äì –î–µ–Ω—å –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–∏—è\\".

History Share of the Fageol Motors Company, issued 10. November 1921 The company was founded by Rollie, William, Frank and Claude Fageol in 1916 to manufacture motor trucks, farm tractors and automobiles in Oakland, California. It was located next to Oakland Assembly, then a Chevrolet factory originally built in 1917 by William Durant, which later became part of General Motors. Fageol produced two luxury automobiles, but production was halted when the supply of Hall-Scott SOHC six-cylinder engines was diverted to build airplanes for the World War I effort. The first Fageol farm tractor was a re-labeled Hamilton Walking Tractor, designed and built by Rush E. Hamilton of Geyserville, California. As a result of the many tractor performance trials of the day, the tractor was redesigned to be more compatible with the needs of the West Coast. The Fageol version was designed by a team led by Horatio Smith with the cooperation of Hamilton. In about 1923, the tractor business was sold to the Great Western Motors Company of San Jose, with Hamilton and Smith joining Great Western. In 1921, Fageol became the first company to build a bus from the ground up. This new style bus was initially called \\"Safety Bus\\". The goal was to build a bus that was resistant to overturning when cornering. It had a wide track, and was lower to the ground for ease of entry and exit. Following the successful introduction, the vehicles were renamed \\"Safety Coaches\\", a term intended to imply greater value. Fageol trucks were well built and became favorites of the industry, owing in part to the dual range, mid-mounted transmission. This gearbox allowed for extreme ranges in gearing for slow speed heavy hauling and for highway speeds with lighter loads. These vehicles were easily spotted by the large number \\"7\\" painted on the front of the radiator. Fageol flatbed truck, 1928 model year The Fageol brothers left the company in 1927 to form the Twin Coach Company, manufacturing buses in Kent, Ohio. The leadership was taken over by company president L.H. Bill, but during the Great Depression the company went into receivership, and the bank assumed control and re-organized the company under the name Fageol Truck and Coach. In 1938, T. A. Peterman bought the factory and its contents.Fageol Production Ends Truck & Bus Transportation March 1939 page 25 In 1939, the first Peterbilt was produced. The South Australian Railways operated a number of Fageol buses. In 1932 that system introduced into service the first of four railcars converted from road buses at Islington Railway Workshops. These vehicles initially operated on the SAR gauge Eyre Peninsula Railway, however some were transferred to operate on the Kingston to Naracoorte line, prior to the line's conversion to broad gauge. Because the buses were not designed for rail use, the ride was very rough. The last railcar was condemned in 1961.Port Lincoln Division - Withdrawal of Passenger Service The Recorder August 1968 pages 1-4Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin October 1986 pp219-238 Products Fageol produced tractors, buses and trucks, at least three luxury cars, as well as engines for land vehicles and ships. The company went through several stages, names, and location changes that included Fageol Motors Company, from 1915 to 1932 in Oakland, California; Fageol Motor Sales Company, from 1916 to 1932 in Oakland, California; Fageol Truck and Coach Company, from 1932 to 1938 in Oakland, California; Fageol Motors Company of Ohio, from 1920 to 1922 in Cleveland, Ohio and 1922 to 1926 in Kent, Ohio. =Tractors= The brothers had originally sold the Hamilton Walking Tractor, rebranded as the Fageol Walking Tractor, without much success. They were contracted to solve a transportation issue at the 1915 Panama Pacific Exposition. The fair covered over 600 acres, with two and a half miles of water front property. From February to December over 18 million people visited the fair. The solution provided by the brothers ended up being the Fageol Auto Train, also called the Trackless Train, powered with a Ford motor, pulling two or three low to the ground 20 passenger open-sided cars. The financial backer chose to use a different spelling, for ease of pronunciation, so the company was registered as The Fadgl Auto Train Inc. This led to the founding of the Fageol Motors Company of Oakland. The company reached an agreement with Rush Hamilton of Geyserville, California to manufacture a tractor with spiked rear wheels. =Trucks= In 1950 the company manufactured a unique truck, the TC CargoLiner ‚Äì touted as \\"A Trailer Without A Tractor\\". In 1953 the Twin Coach Company was awarded a patent for what would become the standard in straight truck design. The inventor was Louis J Fageol. The company produced 1 1/2 ton, 2 1/2 ton, 3 1/2-4 ton, and 5-6 ton trucks. =Cars= Since the founding of Fageol Motors Company, there was a plan to build automobiles. Frank R. and William B. Fageol with Louis H. Bill built and marketed what was to be the most expensive luxury car of the time using the Hall-Scott aircraft engine. Marketed as the \\"Fageol Four Passenger Touring Speedster\\" only three were known to have been produced before the government took over the engine manufacturing plant to build war planes, ending production. Other cars built by the company were: *Fageol 100 * Fageol Supersonic * PataRay also known as Fageol Special blog.hemmings =Buses= Fageol produced buses until 1953, when the bus-manufacturing portion of the Fageol Twin Coach Company was absorbed by Flxible. *Twin Coach 44S co-manufactured with JG Brill Company and Twin Coach * Safety Coach * Cruising coach dubbed \\"America\\" * Canopy covered double-decker \\"Sight-Seeing\\" buss * Fageol Flyer * Parlor Car * Rear double- decker Parlor Car * Super Twin (introduced in 1938) was a 14-ton 58-passenger diesel-electric that was hinged in the middle.

Initially the event was to be a six-game series, but it was later extended to eight games. WHA players had been banned from playing in the 1972 series. Bobby Hull, who had just jumped from the NHL to the Winnipeg Jets, had been named to the Canadian team by Harry Sinden, but was not allowed to participate. The 1974 series was an opportunity for Hull and 46-year-old Gordie Howe to play for Canada against the Soviet team.

It was formed by brothers Frank and William Fageol when they left the Fageol Motor Company in 1927. They established the company in Kent to manufacture and sell buses with a new concept design. The body structure of this new bus was unique in that the body also became the frame and two engines ‚Äì \\"twin\\" engines ‚Äì were used to allow for larger passenger loads. This concept was patented by William B. Fageol. Twin Coach \\"Pony Express\\" postal van, circa 1953 Over the years, Twin Coach made transit buses, trolley buses, small delivery vehicles, Fageol six- cylinder gasoline/propane bus and marine engines, Fageol four-cylinder marine engines, and aircraft and truck components. The company was sometimes referred to as \\"Fageol-Twin Coach\\". The company was acquired by Flxible in 1955 and merged with it, but use of the \\"Twin Coach\\" name in marketing continued for a few years,Sebree, Mac; and Ward, Paul (1973). Transit‚Äôs Stepchild: The Trolley Coach, pp. 196‚Äì203. Los Angeles: Interurbans. LCCN 73-84356. and the name was briefly revived (as a brand name only) in the late 1960s by a related company called Highway Products, Inc. Production overview =Trolley buses= Trolley bus production lasted from 1928 to 1951. Notably, the company's very first order and its very last were also its only export orders ever for trolley buses: eight vehicles for Manila, Philippines, in 1928 and four for Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in 1951.Murray, Alan (2000). World Trolleybus Encyclopaedia, pp. 70, 122‚Äì125. Yateley, Hampshire, UK: Trolleybooks. .Porter, Harry; and Worris, Stanley F.X. (1979). Trolleybus Bulletin No. 109: Databook II, p. 73. North American Trackless Trolley Association (defunct). All other orders went to U.S. cities., none to Canadian cities. In the 1930s and 1940s, Twin Coach was one of the largest producers in the very limited field of trolley bus manufacturing in North America. Until the late 1940s, only three other U.S. companies built more trolley buses: the Brill companies (J.G. Brill and successors ACF-Brill and CCF-Brill), Pullman and St. Louis Car Company. Another builder, Marmon-Herrington, only entered the field in 1946, but eventually surpassed Twin's total. All told, Twin Coach manufactured only 670 \\"trolley coaches\\" ‚Äì as such vehicles were commonly called at the time ‚Äì but sold them to 16 different cities (all in the U.S.), which equates to around one-third of all of the trolley bus systems ever to exist in the United States. Overall, the company's best customer for trolley coaches was the Seattle Transit System, which bought a total of 177, all between 1940 and 1943. In 1940, Twin Coach also pioneered the development of the articulated trolley bus in North America, although the first such vehicle in the world was built in Europe slightly earlier, in 1939 (by Isotta Fraschini/Stanga in Italy). The company built only two articulated trolley buses, and each was marketed as a \\"Super Twin\\" model. Both were originally built as demonstrators. The 1940 unit was eventually sold to the Cleveland transit system and entered service there. The second was built as a gas-powered bus in 1946, but was converted into a trolley bus in 1948, leased to the Chicago Transit Authority and was sold to CTA in 1954.Kristopans, Andris (April‚ÄìJune 2000). \\"Chicago [history of transit system] Part 2: Chicago Transit Authority Takes Over, 1947‚Äì1958\\". Motor Coach Age, pp. 5, 32. With both vehicles, the articulation joint allowed only vertical, not horizontal, movement. These two prototypes never led to any series production, so each remained unique. The 1948 Chicago vehicle is preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum. Until 1985, these two vehicles remained the only articulated trolley buses ever built in North America by any manufacturer. =Motor buses= Twin 1937 Model 40-R(DE), in Boston Elevated Railway service, c. 1940 A Twin Coach/Herkules 38-S-DT (1948) in Lucerne, Switzerland Twin Coach also built motor buses (buses powered by internal combustion engines). Fuels included at least gasoline and propane. Between 1927 and 1934 alone, the company built more than 1,100 motor buses, including 21 with gas-electric drive.Bail, Eli (Spring 1988). \\"Frank Fageol and his Twin Coach\\". Bus World, pp. 24‚Äì25. . Bus production continued through to the time of the company's acquisition by Flxible, in the 1950s. For many years the Fageol 'Twin Coach' was used to take passengers from Canada to US (and back) via the 'Detroit-Windsor Tunnel' under the Detroit River. Sale of bus division In 1955, the bus manufacturing operations were sold to Flxible, which was also based in Ohio. For a time, Flxible used the Twin Coach name ‚Äì along with its own ‚Äì in its marketing and some buses carried front name plates that gave both names and combined the companies' two logos into one. By 1963, use of the Twin Coach name on buses had been discontinued. The marine-engine and aircraft divisions continued as Twin Coach. In 1958, after selling the marine division to Crofton Manufacturing Company of Los Angeles, the company moved its remaining production to Cheektowaga, New York. In 1962, the company's name was changed to Twin Industries. A portion of the company called Highway Products produced a number of products, such as small Post Office vehicles, mobile post offices used in rural areas, small boats for military and commercial uses, missile launchers and a variety of other products. Production of a small bus, sold under the \\"Twin Coach\\" name, began in 1969. In 1970, the company was sold and became a subsidiary of the Alco Standard company, continuing to produce the \\"Twin Coach\\" and Cortez Motor Homes until its bankruptcy in 1975. ReferencesG.N.

The state highway runs from the beginning of state maintenance at Love Point east to MD 213 in Centreville. MD 18 is the main east-west local highway on Kent Island and east to Centreville, serving the centers of Stevensville, Chester, Kent Narrows, Grasonville, and Queenstown that are bypassed by U.S. Route 50 (US 50) and US 301\\\\. What is signed as MD 18 is actually a set of four suffixed highways: MD 18A, MD 18B, MD 18S, and MD 18C. There are also several unsigned segments of MD 18 scattered along the length of the signed portions. What is now MD 18 was first paved in the 1910s from Centreville to Queenstown along with short segments in Grasonville and Chester. Gaps in the Stevensville-Queenstown highway were filled throughout the 1920s, leaving only a crossing of Kent Narrows to be completed in the early 1930s. MD 18 between Stevensville and Love Point was constructed in the early 1930s. The Stevensville-Queenstown highway was designated part of MD 404, while the highways on both ends to Love Point and Centreville were designated MD 18\\\\. US 50 replaced MD 404 when the former highway was extended east of Annapolis in 1949. When US 50 was relocated as a divided highway between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Queenstown in the early 1950s, MD 18 was assigned to the bypassed highway. Since the mid-1980s, several suffixed sections of MD 18 have been created, relocated, or received new designations due to expansion of US 50 and US 301 to a freeway. Route description View west along MD 18A at MD 8 in Stevensville The mainline of MD 18 consists of four internally suffixed sections. MD 18A runs from Love Point south and east through Stevensville to a roundabout at Castle Marina Road in Chester. MD 18B extends from the same roundabout east through Chester, Kent Narrows, and Grasonville to US 50 in Queenstown. MD 18S has a length of between US 50 and US 301 in Queenstown. MD 18C comprises the easternmost of the highway from US 301 in Queenstown to MD 213 in Centreville. MD 18A's western terminus is at the beginning of state maintenance on Love Point Road just south of the community of Love Point at the northern end of Kent Island. The state highway heads due south as a two- lane undivided road through farmland. After meeting Old Love Point Road at an acute angle, MD 18A passes suburban subdivisions and Kent Island High School. Love Point Road, which is unsigned MD 835C, veers southeast to pass through the Stevensville Historic District, which contains the historic Cray House, the Stevensville Bank building, and Christ Church. MD 18A curves to the southwest as Business Parkway. The state highway expands to a four-lane divided highway ahead of the intersection with MD 8\\\\. MD 8 continues south on the divided highway toward an interchange with US 50 and US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway) just east of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge while MD 18A turns east onto two-lane undivided Main Street. MD 18A curves around the southern edge of the Stevensville Historic District, intersecting Love Point Road, which is unsigned MD 759B to the south, and the other end of MD 835C (East Main Street). The state highway passes Stevensville Middle School, crosses Cox Creek, and passes the Kent Island Shopping Center before reaching its eastern terminus at a roundabout with Castle Marina Road, which is unsigned MD 18H to the south. MD 18 eastbound in Grasonville MD 18B begins at the same roundabout at which MD 18A has its eastern terminus. Piney Creek Road, which is unsigned MD 18T, splits to the east as MD 18B curves southeast and crosses over US 50 and US 301\\\\. The state highway curves east again at an intersection with its old alignment, Postal Road, in Chester shortly before an intersection with MD 552 (Dominion Road). MD 18B continues around the south end of Piney Creek before entering the hamlet of Kent Narrows, where the highway has a direct connection to eastbound US 50 and US 301\\\\. The state highway also has an indirect connection to the westbound freeway via Piney Narrows Road, where it passes south of a park and ride lot under the freeway serving MTA Maryland commuter buses, immediately before crossing Kent Narrows on a drawbridge adjacent to the US 50 and US 301 crossing of the strait. MD 18B continues east through Grasonville, where the highway intersects Chester River Beach Road (unsigned MD 18V) and Nesbit Road (unsigned MD 835K), both of which provide full access to the freeway. Past Nesbit Road, the road passes southeast of the University of Maryland Shore Emergency Center at Queenstown and the University of Maryland Shore Medical Pavilion at Queenstown. The state highway continues through farmland before reaching its eastern terminus at US 50 (Ocean Gateway) just east of the US 50 - US 301 split in Queenstown. The two highways meet at a superstreet intersection, so there is no direct access between MD 18B and MD 18S on the opposite side of the intersection. MD 18S begins at US 50 opposite MD 18B's eastern terminus. At the intersection with MD 656 (Friels Road) and Outlet Center Drive, which heads into the Queenstown Premium Outlets, the state highway turns north and reaches its eastern terminus at a superstreet intersection with US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway). MD 18C begins at US 301 opposite the eastern terminus of MD 18S. The state highway heads northeast as Main Street through the town of Queenstown, where the highway intersects MD 456 (Del Rhodes Avenue) and passes near the historic home Bowlingly. After leaving the town, MD 18C's name changes to 4-H Park Road and the road passes through farmland. The state highway passes the namesake park of the youth agricultural organization shortly after crossing Reed Creek. MD 18C passes by the historic home Bachelor's Hope before the highway reaches its eastern terminus at MD 213 (Centreville Road) on the southwestern edge of Centreville. History The first sections of MD 18 was paved as three separate state-aid roads within Queenstown and Grasonville by 1915, and between Stevensville and Chester shortly after 1915. The first section paved as a state road was between Centreville and Queenstown by 1919; there were also short pieces of state road paved in Chester and east of Grasonville by 1921. The state road in Chester was extended east to Kent Narrows and the state road near Grasonville was extended west through the village in 1923. The Stevensville-Chester road and the Queenstown-Centreville road were marked as MD 18 by 1927. The road from Stevensville to Love Point was started in 1929 and completed to just south of Love Point in 1930. The highway was extended to its present western terminus by 1933. Pavement was also laid from the west end of Grasonville to Kent Narrows by 1930. The east-west highway between Stevensville and Queenstown was finished with the completion of a timber trestle bascule bridge over Kent Narrows. That highway was marked as MD 404 in 1933; the highways from Stevensville to Love Point and from Queenstown to Centreville remained marked as MD 18. MD 18 eastbound across the Old Kent Narrows Bridge When US 50 was extended to the Eastern Shore in 1949, it was routed along MD 404 to Wye Mills. The US 50 divided highway started construction in 1950 and was completed between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Queenstown in 1952, including a new drawbridge over Kent Narrows. The 1933 bridge over Kent Narrows was dismantled in 1953. MD 18 was subsequently assigned to old US 50 between Stevensville and Queenstown, following its own alignment except for a concurrency with US 50 and later US 301 over Kent Narrows. Business Parkway was constructed in 1987 as a new alignment and northern extension of MD 8. MD 18 was extended west to Business Parkway and north on the divided highway to bypass the Stevensville Historic District in 1989; the old alignment was designated MD 835C. MD 18 also bypassed the center of Chester in 1989 by the construction of an overpass of US 50 and US 301 just west of MD 552, replacing the intersection at Castle Marina Road. The latter improvement was part of the transformation of US 50 and US 301 to a freeway from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge to Queenstown, which was completed in 1991. The upgrade included a new fixed high-level bridge over Kent Narrows for US 50 and US 301, relegating the 1952 drawbridge to be used only by MD 18. In 1999, MD 18 was relocated to the north to use a new roundabout at Castle Marina Road in Chester; the old mainline was designated MD 18R. The MD 18 - US 301 junction in Queenstown was transformed into a superstreet intersection in 2003, resulting in the splitting of the MD 18C designation; MD 18S was assigned to the highway south of the junction. As part of the reconstruction of US 50 as a six-lane freeway from US 301 in Queenstown to MD 404 in Wye Mills, the Maryland State Highway Administration plans to construct an overpass of MD 18 over US 50 in Queenstown. MD 18 and US 50 would become connected by a pair of right-in/right-out interchanges. Access to eastbound US 50 would be via a new service road south of US 50 and connections with westbound US 50 would be made through Outlet Center Drive. As of 2011, the project has not been funded.

In 1848, he moved to Gloucester, New Jersey and worked for Gloucester Machine Works as a journeyman and contractor. In 1852, Pratt moved to Hartford, Connecticut to work at Colt Armory. It was at Colt that he met Amos Whitney. Pratt soon left Colt to work at Phoenix Iron Works and brought Whitney along with him. While still working at Phoenix Iron Works, he designed a milling machine for George S. Lincoln & Company of Hartford, Connecticut, which became the Lincoln miller, in some ways perhaps the most important American machine tool of the late 19th century. Over 150,000 machines were built on this form factor (by many firms)., pp. 165‚Äì166. Pratt cofounded the Pratt & Whitney company along with Amos Whitney in 1860. Their first product was a thread winder for the Willimantic Linen Company. They went on to manufacture machine tools, tools for the makers of sewing machines, and gun making machinery for use by the Union Army during the American Civil War. He is credited with being first to permit production of fine gear work. Pratt promoted interchangeable parts and the adoption of a standard system for gages for the United States and Europe. Among several machine-tool patents, his most important was for planing metal granted on July 28, 1869. He served as a member of the board of water commissioners for the city of Hartford for four years. He was a director of the Hartford board of trade and the Pratt & Cady company.

The attraction opened in November 1995, and houses the world's largest private aircraft collection on display. It became the new home for much of owner Kermit Weeks' collection of aircraft that were previously housed at the Weeks Air Museum in Tamiami, Florida and were damaged to varying degrees by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. On April 6, 2014, the attraction was closed to the public, though it is still being maintained and is available for private events. On January 30, 2015, Fantasy of Flight opened a scaled-down museum attraction to display some of their aircraft to the public in the interim while the rest of the facility is upgraded and planned to reopen sometime in the future. Fantasy of Flight was the only attraction in the world to offer daily aerial demonstrations (weather permitting) of aircraft in its collection. Most of Weeks' aircraft are airworthy and may still be seen flying from one of the facility's grass runways or its seaplane runway. Fantasy of Flight fields more airworthy aircraft than the air forces of Austria, Cuba, Denmark, Kuwait, Portugal, or South Africa. It also fields more airworthy fixed-wing aircraft than either the Royal Navy or the Indian Navy.  Facility  General Layout of Fantasy of Flight The facility features a main building consisting of two large hangars (called \\"North\\" and \\"South\\") for the aircraft on display, restoration shops, the immersion environments, a gift shop, and the Art Deco-themed Compass Rose Diner. Just outside the main building across from the entrance is the facility's new ropes course and zip line attraction known as \\"Wing Walk Air.\\" Outside the hangars there is an adjoining tarmac and two grass runways. On the north side of the runways are a maintenance hangar and conference facility. A \\"back lot\\" to the south of the main complex contains warehouses and storage and restoration facilities. More storage facilities are located across Broadway Blvd and are opened to the public as part of the tour. Lake Agnes is also on the property to allow for seaplane operations, with a designated landing/takeoff area on 18/36 and a ramp to taxiway on the eastern shore.  Aircraft operations  Boeing PT-17 Stearman The airfield is officially known as the \\"Orlampa Inc. Airport\\" and uses the airport identifier \\"FA08.\\" The field sits at an estimated elevation of 129 feet (42 meters). It is designated as private use only and special permission is needed to land there. The field is generally closed to all non-company traffic. The airfield consists of two turf runways: runway 4/22 (5090 x 125 ft. / 1551 x 38 m) and runway 14/32 (2500 x 100 ft. / 762 x 30 m). The airfield appears as \\"Orlampa\\" on the Jacksonville sectional chart. The name \\"Orlampa\\" was originated by Kermit Weeks based on the airfield being approximately midway between the cities of Orlando and Tampa. Waldo Wright's Flying Service offers airplane rides for sale from the Fantasy of Flight field during parts of the year and operates a Boeing PT-17 Stearman and a New Standard D-25. The Stearman is used for 30 minute long 'hands-on experience' flights, in which the customer takes control of the aircraft at some point during the flight. The D-25 is used for 15 minute barnstorming flights, in which up to four customers sit in the forward open cockpit of the aircraft as a qualified pilot flies the aircraft.  Collection  The Fantasy of Flight collection contains the following aircraft, although the aircraft are not always present at the museum. Some are on loan to other facilities, others may be flown to events, and still others may be off display for maintenance or restoration. Most of the collection is contained in the north and south hangars which are now closed to the public, with a smaller portion now on display at the interim museum attraction housed in the old maintenance hangar. In 2012, the \\"Golden Hill\\" storage facility attraction opened just across the road from the main facility. A number of aircraft have been re-located into this new building, notably the B-23 Dragon and the B-29 Superfortress nose section, while the buildings were re-arranged in order to allow visitor access, but this section was part of the main facility closure in 2014.

Immersion environments WWI Immersion Experience The immersion environments are part of the main facility now closed to the public, but are available as part of the facilities which can be rented for events. Visitors walk through several immersion environments as they enter the attraction. From the lobby, guests walk into the interior of a World War II- era Douglas C-47 Skytrain complete with lighting and sound effects as if the aircraft were conducting paratrooper operations. Guests pass a seated paratrooper in full kit and move forward toward the Jumpmaster figure standing at the open side hatch. Over the hatch blinks a red \\"Ready\\" light which switches to a green \\"Jump\\" light as the guest approaches the hatch. Through the hatch is the entry to the attraction. Other immersion environments include a \\"sensation of flight\\" simulator, followed by a celebration of the early days of flight. Then, a passage covered by heavy shrapnel-resistant curtains leads visitors into a full-scale representation of the trench warfare of World War I, complete with aircraft overhead. It was, in part, due to the development of aerial warfare that trench fighting became obsolete. The final immersion display includes the collection's Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress housed in a large darkened room staged to appear as a winter evening at RAF Horham, home of the 95th Bombardment Group (Heavy) during World War II. The full-scale diorama, complete with ground vehicles, outbuildings, and landscaping, represents a maintenance area and one of the B-17's engine cowlings and propellers are removed to maintenance stands in front of the aircraft. Guests can enter the plane via the aft side hatch in the tail, walk through the bomb bay, visit the cockpit, and exit near the nose of the aircraft. Golden Hill Storage Facility General view of Golden Hill Building 1 opened to the public in the summer of 2012 For years Fantasy of Flight has maintained a storage building opposite the main property on the north side of Broadway Boulevard where aircraft awaiting restoration were stored. In late 2011, work began on a second building to double the storage space with the intention of spreading out the stored items a bit and opening the buildings to the public on a limited basis. Finally, in June 2011 preparations were sufficient to open one building for a special preview over the Father's Day holiday. The response to the limited, self-guided experience was overwhelmingly positive, and the building joined the attraction's public programming in the summer of 2012, with the second building scheduled to open shortly thereafter. The buildings are known by Fantasy of Flight as the \\"Golden Hill\\" facility as a tongue in cheek reference to the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility of the National Air and Space Museum which is nicknamed \\"Silver Hill\\" by the NASM staff. Fantasy of Flight guest access to the Golden Hill facility is via over-the-road trolley operated from the main parking lot in the mornings. Guests are allowed to explore the facility on their own with docents present to answer questions. The facility closes at midday due to the lack of comfortable air handling equipment in the steel buildings which can get hot in the Florida sun.  N1944A  Crews work to solve an oil leak on N1944A prior to departure from England In the summer of 2011, Kermit Weeks and a crew from Fantasy of Flight flew to Cotswold Airport in the United Kingdom to evaluate a Douglas C-47 Skytrain for possible purchase. The aircraft has a distinguished war record including sorties during the D-Day invasion and Operation Market Garden. At the end of July, Weeks went forward with the purchase. His crew conducted minor repairs and the plane, registration number N1944A, was flown back to the United States by Weeks and his crew. Due to weather delays on some legs of the trip, the journey took a total of 11 days and covered approximately 4500 miles from Kemble, UK to Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Fans of the aircraft, Kermit Weeks, or Fantasy of Flight were able to watch the trip documented daily on Fantasy of Flight's Facebook page as the crew sent back pictures and observations along the way. The aircraft arrived without incident on August 4, 2011 at Oshkosh. It was on display at the EAA AirVenture Museum for several months before being moved permanently to the campus of Fantasy of Flight in Polk City. On May 1, 2012, the C-47 was finally flown south to Fantasy of Flight, arriving on May 2 after an overnight stop in Douglas, Georgia. The aircraft is now on display at the attraction and open to guest walk-throughs.  Douglas DC-3 attraction sign  DC-3 attraction sign Standing along the side of Interstate 4 near the exit for Fantasy of Flight is a Douglas DC-3 painted with the attraction's name to get the attention of passers by. The aircraft itself is not part of the collection and was, in fact, specifically purchased for its intended purpose as an attraction sign. The airframe is far too corroded to make restoration of the DC-3 feasible. The aircraft was displayed for a period of time in a 'crashed' position, nose down in the ground with a mannequin hanging from the tail wheel, apparently a 'man' evacuating the aircraft with a parachute. The mannequin was dressed up for certain occasions around the year, including Santa Claus for Christmas; Uncle Sam for Independence Day; and a Pilgrim for Thanksgiving. The aircraft in this crashed position received a mixture of criticism and compliments. Some people claimed that the display made the aircraft look bad and set a bad example to airline passengers without an aviation background, while others found the position of the aircraft comical and many enjoyed guessing what the mannequin would be dressed as next. Currently, the aircraft is in an upright position with the mannequin seated in the opened cockpit hatch on the left hand side.  The Compass Rose Diner  Patrons at the Compass Rose Adjacent to the attraction's lobby is an Art Deco themed restaurant called \\"The Compass Rose Diner\\" which features the characteristics of diners associated with airports during the 1930s and early 1940s. The restaurant features tall windows, multi- hued terrazzo floors, and the curved architectural lines associated with the Art Deco period. The diner was open to the public and served a short-order menu similar to that of lunch counters popularized during the pre-World War II era. When the main facility was closed to the public in 2014, the diner was closed and much of its equipment sold off, though the space itself is still available as part of the venue's rental offerings. Partial closing On March 4, 2014, Fantasy of Flight announced that they would close to the public after April 6, 2014 but continue to stage private events. They further announced that they would reopen to the public in late 2014 as a scaled-down museum, with reduced admission prices, while they simultaneously begin to design and build the main facility into more of a destination attraction that would appeal to a wider audience rather than just aviation aficionados. Ironically, the announcement that the facility would soon be closing its doors to the public has caused a significant upswell in visitors. Crowds have been so large that the facility has had to make use of its overflow parking area on multiple occasions since the announcement. As of 2017 the museum is open on Fridays, Saturdays, and most Sundays.

This also involves significant attention being given to the Inquisition and to its ramifications for Sephardic Jews as well as for the general Jewish community. Membership in the SCJS is composed of scholars interested in crypto-Jews, descendants of crypto-Jews, and others interested in the topic from a historical, sociological, anthropological, religious, ethnic, literary, philosophical, or other perspective. The Society is nonreligious, and membership is open to all. Today, there is much interest, both academic and personal, in the history and contemporary status of crypto-Jews, and a number of distinguished scholars have published in the area. Especially in recent years, a number of people, especially, but not limited to, Hispanics, have returned or converted to Judaism, frequently in part because of knowledge of a previously-suppressed Jewish heritage. New Mexico, Texas, Arizona, and California are major areas of interest, but significant interest also is found in Miami, Florida, Orlando, Florida, New York City, Portland, Oregon, and other areas with large numbers of Hispanics. This contemporary phenomenon of returning/converting also is of specific interest to some academic researchers. The SCJS publishes HaLapid: The Journal of the Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies, a combination newsletter and journal. Published four times per year, HaLapid (Hebrew for The Torch) mostly includes refereed academic research articles, personal stories by descendants of crypto-Jews, and news items, but also includes occasional poetry, links for related websites, and other items of interest. The SCJC also hosts a website, and helps answer questions and make referrals for interested persons. The Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies meets annually for a three-day conference which includes a keynote speaker, sessions on recent research findings, personal stories of returnees, business sessions, and various forms of entertainment. At the 2003 annual conference in San Antonio, Texas, the keynote speaker was retired Rabbi Samuel Lerer who spent much of his 51-year career working with anusim in Mexico. The SCJS has taken a lead in interest in DNA studies, especially as it applies to crypto-Jews, other Sephardim, and the Jewish community in general.

They have issued two studio albums, Totem (March 1995) and Iconoclast (July 2009). In October 2020, the long awaited studio album titled \\"Irkalla\\" has been completed with the lineup being Adrian Henderson on guitar, Lachlan Mitchell on keyboards and guitar, John McLaughlin on drums and Dalibor Backovic on vocals and bass guitar. History = Early years and Totem (1993‚Äì1997) = Nazxul were formed in 1993Encyclopaedia Metallum - Nazxul by guitarist Adrian Henderson, keyboards player-guitarist Lachlan Mitchell, former Mortal Sin and Slaughter Lord drummer Steve Hughes and Dalibor Backovic on vocals and bass guitar. Originally envisioned as a mysterious studio-bound project, the group only appeared in publicity photos as shadowy figures or draped facelessly in cloaks. In 1994 a self-titled demo album appeared through Vampire Records. According to Voltage Media's reporter it was \\"met with a mixture of astonishment and ultimate praise from critics, allegiance and enthusiasm by extreme music disciples, and revulsion by the ignorant and myopic.\\" Soon after guitarist Greg Morelli, from Sydney thrash band Grungeon, joined the fold and work began on the band's first album 'Totem' which went on to become a cult classic. Though reviews were mixed, it was ultimately praised throughout the underground as a unique and powerful debut. = \\"Black Seed\\" (1998-2007) and touring = Nazxul live, Sydney, 1999 Further material was written, during which time Backovic departed and two new members joined, singer Morte from an avant-garde black metal group called Bestianity and guitarist Rev. Kriss Hades from the notorious Sydney death metal band Sadistik Exekution who were experiencing one of their well-known self-imposed dormant periods. This line- up produced the EP \\"Black Seed\\" in 1998 and late in the year played live for the first time at a show in Sydney, with Henderson moving to bass guitar. Hughes left the group after this to pursue a career in stand-up comedy and soon left Australia to live in the UK. His replacement was Peter Kostic from Sydney rock band Front End Loader. Almost immediately, Nazxul was booked to support Finnish extreme metal group Impaled Nazarene on part of an Australian tour. In a remarkable turn of events, Kostic's other band was then approached to tour with British rock group Skunk Anansie over the same period but declined due to the drummer's commitment to Nazxul; the Skunk Anansie tour was in turn cancelled when the group suddenly split up. Morte was fired after this tour and Backovic returned for Nazxul's appearance at the Metal for the Brain festival. In the meantime, \\"Black Seed\\" was re-released with several live tracks recorded during the tour added to the track listing. The cover was slightly amended with the iconography rendered in gold instead of green. After playing a final show for the year all activity from Nazxul then appeared to cease abruptly. Kostic joined Regurgitator in 2000 and the Hard Ons in 2001. Hades recorded two more albums with Sadistik Exekution before embarking on a solo career. Mitchell continued his work as a professional sound engineer / producer and in late 2001 formed a rock band Brace with several former members of Canberra group Henry's Anger. Backovic left Nazxul in 2000 to pursue a career in the film industry as a screenplay writer and director. In 2002, Sydney black metal label Decius released a limited-edition live album (titled simply Live) on 12\\" vinyl. The recording was of the group's 1999 Metal for the Brain performance. A year later, the Nazxul track \\"Apostasies Legions Arise, Xul!\\" appeared on a compilation release from Hiberica Records along with tracks from American band Krieg, Necroplasma from Sweden and Goat Semen from Peru. The band was not at an end however. Four tracks of dark ambience, recorded by Henderson, Mitchell and Morelli, were released on a split EP with Melek Tha in 2004. The same year, Nazxul regrouped with a new line-up that included Henderson, Morelli and Mitchell plus two former members of Wollongong black metal band Secretain, Daniel Lomas (vocals) and Luke Mills (guitar), and drummer Tim Yatras from another Wollongong band called Battalion. Originally booked to tour with Dimmu Borgir, the Norwegian band cancelled its visit but several months later Nazxul undertook a tour with Adelaide based gothic metal band Virgin Black instead. Nazxul then became dormant for some time since. Mills continued to play in various black metal bands and Yatras was the drummer with Lord between 2005 and May 2009. = \\"Iconoclast\\" (2008‚Äìpresent) and touring = In 2008 Nazxul reformed and were listed as the national support to the Australian leg of Mayhem's tour; this tour was cancelled however. The band completed work on the long-awaited Iconoclast album, first mooted in 1998, during the year. Greg Morelli died in a motorcycle accident on 20 November 2008 in North Strathfield. He had just completed his guitar parts for the album, before his death. Nazxul asked those who listen to \\"Oath (Tides Resurrection)\\" to think of Morelli: it is performed in his honour. Iconoclast was released in July 2009 by German label Eisenwald Records. Guitarist Petar Peric from Infernal Method replaced the late Morelli, and drummer John McLaughlin replaced Tim Yatras. International touring went ahead at the end of 2009 with shows in England, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Russia. Nazxul are currently working on the worldwide release of their new album titled \\"Irkalla\\" - scheduled for October 2020.

He was a member of the prominent Whitney family. He was born in Biddeford, Maine to Aaron and Rebecca (Perkins) Whitney and educated at the common schools in Saccarappa, Maine and Exeter, New Hampshire. He moved at the age of 14 with his parents to Lawrence, Massachusetts and apprenticed at the Essex Machine Company. In 1852, he moved to Hartford, Connecticut and worked at the Colt Armory. At Colt, he met Francis A. Pratt who soon left to become superintendent at the Phoenix Iron Works and took Whitney with him. While working at Phoenix Iron Works, Whitney designed the Lincoln milling machine. In 1860, while still working at the Phoenix Iron Works, Pratt and Whitney formed the Pratt & Whitney company. Their first product was a thread winder for the Willimantic Linen Company. They went on to manufacture machine tools for the manufacture of guns, sewing machines, bicycles and typewriters. The manufacturing of gun making machinery rapidly increased during the American Civil War. In 1893, Whitney was made vice-president of the company and worked as president from 1898 to 1901. The company was acquired by the Niles-Bement-Pond Company and Whitney remained as one of the directors. He also worked as president and director of the Gray Telephone Pay Station Company, director of the Pratt & Cady Co., director in the Co-operative Savings Bank and as treasurer of Whitney Manufacturing Company which was organized by his son Clarence. He died on August 5, 1920 in Poland Spring, Maine and was interred at Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford, Connecticut.

Upon entering service, the type became Italy‚Äôs first single-seat, all-metal monoplane that had an enclosed cockpit and retractable undercarriage.Ethell 1995, p. 64. On 26 February 1937, the G.50 conducted its maiden flight. During early 1938, the Freccias served in the Regia Aeronautica (the Italian Air Force) and with its expeditionary arm, the Aviazione Legionaria, in Spain, where they proved to be relatively fast and very manoeuvrable in comparison to its adversaries in the theatre.Gunston 1988, pp. 250‚Äì253. Early in the Second World War, it was determined that the G.50 possessed inadequate armament, comprising a pair of Breda-SAFAT machine guns.Gunston 1988, p. 253. The fighter was extensively used on various fronts by Italy, including in Northern Europe, North Africa, the Balkans, and the Italian mainland. The G.50 commonly came up against the British Hawker Hurricane, which was fast enough to frequently outrun and out- range the Italian opponent. Later models of the fighter had improvements, including a substantial increase in range. The G.50 was exported to several overseas customers, small numbers being flown by the Croatian Air Force while 35 G.50 fighters were shipped to Finland, where they served with distinction during both the Winter War of 1940 and the Continuation War of 1941‚Äì1944 against the Soviet Union. In Finnish service, the type reportedly achieved an unprecedented kill/loss ratio of 33/1.Arena 1996, p. 483. Development =Background= The Fiat G.50 had its origins in a design produced by Italian aeronautics engineer Giuseppe Gabrielli. This represented a major change for Fiat, who previously relied on chief engineer Celestino Rosatelli. External to Gabrielli's influence, the fighter's design was also shaped by the issuing of a specification during 1936 which sought a modern interceptor aircraft for the Regia Aeronautica (the Italian Air Force).Cattaneo 1967, p. 3. Gabrielli started work on the design in April 1935.Avions Militaires 1919‚Äì1939 ‚Äì Profils et Histoire 1979, p. 118.Air International May 1988, pp. 251‚Äì252. The design was state-of-the-art for the era; on its introduction, it would become the most advanced fighter to be produced in Italy. Construction of two prototypes began mid-summer 1936. Manufacturing was turned over to CMASA (Costruzioni Meccaniche Aeronautiche S.A.), a subsidiary of Fiat at Marina di Pisa. On 26 February 1937, the first prototype performed its maiden flight. Flown by Comandante Giovanni de Briganti, the chief test pilot for the G.50 program, it took off from Caselle airfield, Turin. During this flight, the prototype was recorded as having attained a top speed of as well as having climbed to an altitude of meters in the space of six minutes, 40 seconds.Malizia 2004, p. 17. During October 1937, it was officially unveiled to the public at the Milan International Aeronautical Show. As a consequence of its new design, it was decided to conduct an extended flight evaluation programme in order to validate its performance. During 1937, along with the first pre-series machines, a gruppo sperimentale (experimental group) was formed. Early flying experiences with the G.50 revealed it to possess relatively light controls and to be extremely manoeuvrable for a monoplane in comparison with prior designs. However, two separate issues were also identified, the limited power output of its radial engine and the lack of firepower, consisting of only a pair of machine guns. =Initial orders= During September 1937, Fiat received an order for an additional batch of 45 aircraft. In advance of the placement of a larger order, the Italian Air Ministry decided to hold a round of comparative 'fly-off' test flight between the type and the newly developed Macchi MC.200. On 8 November 1937, de Briganti was killed during the sixth evaluation flight of the second prototype (M.M.335), when the fighter failed to pull out of a high-speed dive.Malizia 2004, pp. 17‚Äì19. Flight tests conducted at Guidonia showed that the aircraft went too readily into an uncontrolled spin, a highly dangerous trait, especially at low level where recovery was impossible. During a visit by the Italian King Victor Emmanuel III and Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, another tragedy occurred at Guidonia. While performing a low, fast pass, three G.50s flown by experienced pilots, Maggiore (Squadron Leader) Mario Bonzano and Lieutenants Beretta and Marasco, got into difficulty. Beretta's aircraft spun uncontrollably and crashed into the ammunition laboratory, killing the pilot.Malizia 2004, p. 19. Despite the crashes, overall results from the flight test programme were deemed to be satisfactory and the Freccia proved to be more manoeuvrable than the faster Macchi MC.200, and the G.50 was declared the winner of the Caccia I (\\"Fighter One\\") competition on 9 June 1938. On account of its manoeuvrability, the Regia Aeronautica Commission decided to order the G.50 as well, rejecting the competition's third contender, the IMAM Ro.51.De Marchi, Italo. Macchi MC.200 \\"Saetta\\" (In Italian). Modena, Italy: Editore Stem-Mucchi, 1994. The first production aircraft were delivered to the Regia Aeronautica in early 1939. Reportedly, Italian pilots did not like the enclosed canopy because it could not be opened quickly and, being constructed from plexiglas of relatively poor quality, was prone to cracking or abrasion by sand or dust, limiting visibility. In addition, exhaust fumes tended to accumulate in the cockpit, so pilots would often fly the fighter with the canopy locked open.Air International May 1988, p. 255.Malizia 2004, p. 21. Consequently, an open cockpit was installed in the second batch of 200 machines. After 1939, the bulk of production for the G.50 was transferred to the CMASA factory in Marina di Pisa, Tuscany.Gunston 1984, p. 222. The first versions of the G.50 could be outfitted with several different configurations of armaments: either a single, or a pair of, (.5 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns in the nose and an additional pair of (.303 in) Breda-SAFAT in the wings. Later versions of the aircraft could be distinguished by the addition of a larger rudder.Bignozzi, Giorgio. Aerei d'Italia (in Italian). Milan: Edizioni E.C.A., 2000. =Further development= During 1938, the Regia Aeronautica requested that two-seat trainer variant of the G.50 be developed, designated G.50/B (Bicomando ‚Äì dual control). The first of these were constructed during the second half of 1939. The student pilot sat in the front in a closed cockpit with two roll bars. The first five aircraft were part of the 1a serie (\\"first series\\"). Further production was entrusted to CMASA, who completed 106 G.50/Bs.Cattaneo 1967, pp. 3‚Äì4. A single G.50/B was later transformed into a reconnaissance aircraft, which was equipped with a planimetric camera. Another G.50/B was adapted with a tailhook for the purpose of operating as a naval reconnaissance aircraft from the aircraft carrier Aquila, but this vessel was never completed.Arena 1996, p. 455. During September 1940, a slightly improved version, designated as the G.50 bis. The primary advantage was the extended combat range, which was provided by an additional tank, increasing its range from to . The ultimate version of the fighter was the G.50/V (Veloce ‚Äì fast) built in mid-1941 by CMASA and equipped with a Daimler-Benz DB 601 engine of 1,075 CV. During tests at Fiat Aviazione's airfield in Turin, it reached a top speed of in level flight and climbed to in five minutes 30 seconds. By this time, however, Gabrielli had already designed the Fiat G.55, and Fiat had obtained the licence to build the 1,475 CV Daimler Benz 605, so the G.50/V was used to test new equipment and then scrapped.Arena 1996, p. 456. In total, production of the G.50 reached 784 aircraft; 426 of which having been manufactured by Fiat Aviazione and another 358 being built by CMASA. There were 58 fighters that were recorded as export sales: 13 G.50s had been sold to Spain, along with 35 aircraft to Finland and a final 10 to Croatia.Arena 1996, p. 459. Two of the G.50 aircraft to be delivered were destroyed due to a lack of fuel before arriving in Finland. On 7 March, sergeant Aster Wallius forgot to switch the fuel pump to the main tank and the G.50 (FA-8) crashed, injuring the pilot. On 8 March, a Hungarian volunteer pilot, 2nd lieutenant Wilmos Belassy, apparently dived into the Baltic sea, after running out of fuel and failing to cross it from Sweden to Finland. The FA-7 and pilot have not been found. His fellow pilot, 2nd lieutenant Matias Pirity, had turned back and saved both the G.50 and himself. Design The Fiat G.50 was a low-wing single-engine monoplane fighter interceptor aircraft.Cattaneo 1967, p. 4. It featured all-metal construction, comprising a semi-monocoque fuselage with an exterior skin composed of light alloys. The structure of the fuselage was formed from four main longerons and 17 formers, closing into a load-bearing bulkhead forming the rear of the fuselage. The wings were divided into three separate sections, composed of a steel tube centre-section structure that was paired with duralumin outer wings and an alloy skin. The ailerons, which were both statically and aerodynamically balanced, had a metal structure covered by fabric. Hydraulically-actuated four-piece slotted-flaps were fitted to the aircraft's wings to improve its take-off and landing performance; these would automatically retract upon attaining a certain airspeed. The G.50 was equipped with retractable landing gear, consisting of inwardly-retracting mainwheels and a fixed, castoring tailwheel.Air International May 1988, pp. 253‚Äì254. It was the first front-line Italian fighter to be fitted with a retractable undercarriage, an enclosed cockpit, and a constant speed propeller;Air International May 1988, p. 251. these improvements have been credited with enabling the G.50 to achieve a maximum speed that was faster than its contemporary, the Fiat CR.42 biplane. According to aviation author Gianni Cattaneo, the G.50 was a \\"robust and viceless aircraft which marked the introduction of new concepts and techniques, of design and manufacture\\". Powered by a single Fiat A.74 R.C.38 14-cylinder air-cooled supercharged radial engine, rated at for take-off and at , enclosed in a NACA cowling and mounted upon a chrome-molybdenum steel tubular structure attached with flexible mounts. Access for maintenance of the engine was provided via large cowling doors and panels on the fuselage aft of the firewall gave access for fuel tanks and armament. The engine incorporated a reduction gear which drove the Hamiliton-Fiat 3-bladed all-metal constant speed propeller. The pilot sat in an enclosed cockpit under a sliding transparent canopy; the seat was adjustable both in height and angle of inclination to suit the pilot's preferences.Cattaneo 1967, pp. 4‚Äì5. Despite the canopy possessing favourable transparency, including a relatively unobstructed rearward view, pilots were unenthusiastic about the enclosed arrangement, leading to various types of open canopies being trialled and eventually a set of hinged transparent side- flaps were standardised upon.Cattaneo 1967, p. 5. A reflector sight was present for the purpose of aiming the fighter's armament, which comprised a pair of 12.7 mm (.5 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns with 300 rounds of ammunition per gun.https://docviewer.yandex.ru/?url=ya- disk%3A%2F%2F%2Fdisk%2FFiat_G50.pdf&name;=Fiat_G50.pdf&c;=53624123f2d6&page;=77 The machine guns, fitted directly forward of the cockpit, were fired using synchronisation gear to fire through the propeller arc; both single-shot and salvo-fire modes were available. Operational history =Introduction= Mario Bonzano's personal Fiat G.50 \\"1-1\\", in Spain, January 1939. During 1938, the first operational Fiat G.50 fighters were delivered to the Regia Aeronautica. During the Spanish Civil War, about a dozen G.50s were dispatched to Spain to reinforce the Aviazione Legionaria, Italy's contribution to the conflict. The first of these were delivered to the theatre during January 1939. The value of its presence in the Spanish theatre is questionable as none of the fighters sent saw actual combat. At the civil war's end, the G.50s in the region were handed over to Spanish pilots and subsequently saw action in Morocco. Cattaneo summarised of the experience: \\"Little seems to have been learnt as nothing was done to increase the armament\\". Upon the G.50's entry to service, it was widely regarded as being an extremely manoeuvrable aircraft and was often considered to be one of Italy's best fighters. However, by the time of the outbreak of the Second World War, rapid advancements in the field of aviation had contributed to the type being considered to be both underpowered and underarmed in comparison to competing frontline fighters then in use by the main powers. In spite of this, in the buildup to the Second World War, further units of the Regia Aeronautica were equipped with newly delivered G.50s; these were heavily used in various exercises and war-games from November 1939 onwards as it became increasingly clear that Italy would likely soon be at war with the Western democracies. Upon Italy's entry into the Second World War in June 1940, the Regia Aeronautica possessed a total of 118 G.50s that were available for operations; of these, 97 aircraft were available to perform front line duties while others were either in maintenance or awaiting delivery. The majority of these were assigned to 51¬∞ Stormo, (groupStormo means \\"group\\" in British English; the equivalent in US English is \\"wing\\". Conversely, Gruppo is \\"wing\\" in British English and \\"group\\" in US English.) which was based at Ciampino Airport (just outside Rome) and at Pontedera, with 22¬∞ Gruppo (wing) of 52¬∞ Stormo. On 10 June 1940, when Italy issued its declaration of war against both France and Great Britain, the G.50s of 22¬∞ Gruppo went into action, followed by the 48 aircraft of 20¬∞ Gruppo. Operations during the first few days were sporadic and varied, often serving as escorts for Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers on attack missions against harbours and airfields on the island of Corsica.Cattaneo 1967, pp. 5‚Äì6. These operations were quickly brought to an end when France signed the Armistice of 22 June 1940, officially capitulating to the Axis powers.Cattaneo 1967, p. 6. =Belgian deployment and the Battle of Britain= During September 1940, the 20¬∞ Gruppo (351/352/353 Squadrons), commanded by Maggiore Bonzano and equipped with Fiat G.50, was part of 56¬∞ Stormo, formed to operate during the Battle of Britain as part of the Corpo Aereo Italiano (Italian Air Corps, CAI) based in Belgium, together with the 18¬∞ Gruppo flying Fiat CR.42s. According to Cattaneo, the Italian government had decided to participate in the German air offensive against the British mainland due to political opportunism and in pursuit of prestige; he alleged that the Air Staff would have rather directed those aircraft towards other fronts where they would have stood a better chance of making a meaningful contribution. In this theatre, the G.50 was normally hampered by its relatively slow speed, open cockpits and short range. Cattaneo also noted that the presence of poor weather conditions and the use of relatively unprepared personnel were additional factors that undermined the fighter's effectiveness. Those G.50s that were deployed were early models and thus furnished with an open canopy, which was useful in a typical Mediterranean climate but led to the pilots suffer heavily in the colder weather of northern Europe. The aircraft was also under-equipped, provided with a mediocre radio set (powered by batteries that were prone to freeze at altitude) and lacking any armour protection. The experiences of the early G.50s over Britain soon showed their inadequacies in combat. Their operations were considered to be next to useless during the campaign, in part because they were too short-ranged and stationed too far from enemy territory. The G.50 possessed relatively limited endurance, thus missions rarely exceeded one hour. The G.50 bis, which was equipped with larger fuel tanks, was already in production, but it was not sent to 20¬∞ Gruppo in time to participate. Its performance was also lacking: during one incident on 5 November 1940, a formation of 22 G.50s intercepted several British Hawker Hurricanes, resulting in the RAF fighters escaping with ease. On 21 November 1940, when a Bristol Blenheim attacked the airfield at Maldegem, Belgium, a pair of G.50s were scrambled, but they lost the bomber in the clouds. On 23 November, several G.50s followed a flight of four Hurricanes, but were unable to close on them. On 31 January 1941, another fruitless interception occurred when a number of G.50s were evaded by a single Blenheim that escaped into the clouds. At the beginning of 1941, the CAI were redeployed back to Italy, leaving behind a pair of G.50 squadrons that stayed in Belgium alongside Luftflotte 2 until April 1941. Overall, the G.50s flew a total of 429 missions, 34 escorts and 26 scrambles for the CAI, but failed to engage any enemy aircraft during these actions. A single aeroplane was lost and seven more were damaged during the deployment. While operating with Luftflotte 2, 20¬∞ Gruppo lost four additional fighters and two pilots were killed. A pair of G.50s were recorded as having been damaged by friendly fire from German fighters and flak.Arena 1996, pp. 489‚Äì491. In Belgium, 20¬∞ Gruppo had the opportunity to see the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 in action; several G.50 pilots are known to have been trained to fly the type as well. Around the same time, a pair of Bf 109E pilots were attached to the Gruppo in mid-January 1941.Leproni, Enrico. \\"I G.50 sull'Inghilterra.\\" Storia Militare Magazine, Albertelli editions, Parma 9/08, pp. 12‚Äì15. On 8 April 1941, the last sighting of enemy aircraft by the G.50 occurred, during which the targets, identified as fighters, eluded them yet again. =The North African campaign= On 27 December 1940, the first 27 G.50s, belonging to 150¬™ and 152¬™ Squadriglia, 2¬∞ Gruppo Autonomo C.T., arrived in Libya, where they operated out of Brindisi and Grottaglie airfields. On 9 January 1941, these fighters performed their first combat mission in the theatre when Capitano Pilota (Flight Lieutenant) Tullio De Prato, commander of 150¬™ Squadriglia, was attacked by a Hawker Hurricane Mk I on the front line, forcing him to crash-land in the desert.Malizia 2004, pp. 82‚Äì83. On 31 January 1941, a new G.50-equipped unit, 155¬∞ Gruppo Autonomo C.T., consisting of 351¬™, 360¬™ and 378¬™ Squadrons, commanded by Maggiore Luigi Bianchi, arrived in Libya. Caught up in the chaotic retreat of the Italian Army during the winter of 1940‚Äì41, however, the G.50s saw relatively little actual action.Shores, Masimello and Guest 2012, pp. 120, 148. One of the few initial claims of enemy aircraft being downed by Freccia pilots occurred on 9 April 1941, when Tenente Pilota Carlo Cugnasca (an expert pilot, and the first to deliver a G.50 to Finland), attacked a flight of three British Hurricane Mk Is from No. 73 Squadron and claimed to have downed one, although this loss was not confirmed.Malizia 2004, pp. 82‚Äì84, 85‚Äì88. On his return, he was forced to crash-land his G.50, flipping the aircraft over on the airstrip but remaining unharmed. At low level, the aerial clashes were often confused and had unpredictable effects. Tactical surprise was often a decisive factor in a given engagement, as shown on 14 April when a formation of 66 Axis aircraft, including eight G.50s from 351¬™ Squadriglia, attacked British forces stationed in the vicinity of Tobruk. The RAF defenders of No. 73 Squadron were outnumbered in this engagement, resulting in the Hurricanes, which were only marginally faster than the G.50, having to ignore the Axis fighters and concentrate their efforts upon attacking incoming bombers, which posed the greatest threat. Flying their G.50s, both Cugnasca and Marinelli attacked H.G. Webster's Hurricane while he was shooting at a Stuka dive bomber, resulting in Webster being finally shot down and killed over Tobruk. A Canadian pilot, ace Flight Lieutenant James Duncan ‚ÄòSmudger‚Äô Smith (P2652), saw the engagement and subsequently shot down and killed both Cugnasca and Marinelli as well as damaging another G.50 before being shot down himself by the 351¬™ Squadriglia commander, Capitano Angelo Fanello.Mattioli 2001, pp. 10‚Äì12. On 27 May, 20¬∞ Gruppo was reinforced by 151¬™ Squadriglia, which was equipped with the new Fiat G.50 bis. This new version had almost two hours of flight endurance, due to the addition of an extra fuel tank in the internal fuselage section (which had been originally configured as a bomb bay). The normal tactic with the G.50 was to dive from , but they never flew very high over North Africa, usually not exceeding . The aircraft still lacked radio sets and, despite their air filters, the desert sand could reduce the engine's lifespan to only 70‚Äì80 hours.Locatelli, Daniele. \\"Sidi el Barrani, 14 luglio 1941. (in Italian)\\" Storia Militare, Albertelli editions, Parma, January 1998, pp. 31‚Äì32. Although the G.50s were mainly outperformed by Desert Air Force fighters, their pilots sometimes managed to shoot down the faster and better-armed Hurricanes and P-40s. In the hands of expert pilots, the G.50 was even capable of scoring multiple kills during a single sortie. For instance, on the evening of 9 July 1941, Sergente Maggiore Aldo Buvoli of 378¬™ Squadriglia, 155¬∞ Gruppo Autonomo, took off from Castel Benito airfield to patrol Tripoli harbour and intercepted a flight of seven Blenheim light bombers, which had been engaged in a low- level attack on the ships. Two Fiat CR.42 biplanes from 151¬∞ Gruppo were already pursuing the Blenheims when Buvoli attacked, shooting at each bomber in sequence. One Blenheim ditched in the sea while another was shot down a few miles north of Tripoli. Two more failed to return to Luqa airfield in Malta and were posted as missing. For these successes, Buvoli was awarded the Silver Medal of Military Valor and subsequently credited with four kills. No. 110 Squadron reported the loss of a similar number of Blenheim IVs on its first mission since arriving in Malta from the British mainland during early July.Massimello and Apostolo 2000, p. 92.Malizia 2004, pp. 107‚Äì109. An Italian Fiat G.50 captured by the British at Sidi Rezegh airfield in North Africa. An RAF Hawker Hurricane is landing (left) and another is in the background on the right. During the Battle of Sidi Barrani, the first major British offensive of the Western Desert Campaign, a number of G.50s operating out of Martuba Airbase, Derna District, attacked the British-held airfield at Sidi Barrani. On 18 November 1941, during Operation Crusader, the Desert Air Force was responsible for destroying 13 aircraft on the Ain el Gazala airfields, 10 of these being G.50s. On 19 November 20¬∞ Gruppo, based at Sid el Rezegh, suffered heavy losses when British armoured forces suddenly attacked the airfield. Of the 19 G.50s, only three escaped, with 80 pilots and ground crew taken prisoner. Altogether, 26 G.50s were lost and 20 Gruppo was left with only 36 G.50s, of which 27 were serviceable. Mario Bonzano, now a Tenente Colonnello and commander of 20¬∞ Gruppo, was among the captured, and his deputy, Furio Niclot Doglio, was almost shot down, since he was unaware of the British operation. Several G.50s were captured almost intact, and at least one was taken by No. 260 Squadron and later passed to No. 272 Squadron.Rocca 1991, p. 206. After 1941, the G.50 played only a minor role in the Regia Aeronautica. During June 1942, British intelligence estimated that 12 Gruppo had a total of 26 G.50s (10 of these being of a serviceable condition), while the backbone of 5a Squadra Aerea was estimated to have comprised a mixture of 104 C.202s, 63 C.200s, 32 Z.1007 and 31 S.79s.Santoni 2007, p. 8. =Aegean theatre= After Italy declared war on Greece in October 1940, the Freccia commenced offensive operations against Greek and Allied forces over the Balkans and the Aegean Sea on 28 October, typically operating from airfields at Berat, Devoli and Grottaglie.Arena 1996, pp. 491‚Äì492. During the Greek campaign, adverse weather conditions was often responsible for hampering Axis air operations, however, a number of fiercely-fought aerial engagements were fought on several days, often accompanied by a large amount of overclaiming by personnel on both sides of the conflict. Early on 20 February 1941, a flight of Hawker Hurricane fighters were engaged in their first aerial combat over the Balkans when seven G.50s of 54 Gruppo were scrambled from Devoli to intercept a formation of RAF bombers with their Hurricane escorts. A few days earlier, a British cargo ship had delivered six Hurricanes and several Wellington bombers to Paramythia, Greece, boosting RAF power in the region. Freccias claimed to have downed both bomber and a fighter, while the British claimed responsibility for downing four G.50s. That afternoon, 15 G.50s engaged a large mixed formation of RAF Gloster Gladiators, claiming the downing of 10 aircraft for the loss of one G.50.Arena 1996, p. 492. The RAF claimed three G.50s with no loss. Postwar records showed one Bristol Blenheim and a single G.50 being lost on that day. On 28 February 1941, RAF units intercepted a formation of Italian bombers and their escorts, claiming 27 aircraft shot down and several others damaged in the ensuing battle. The Italians claimed to have downed six Gladiators and a single Supermarine Spitfire. The recorded losses were one Gladiator and eight Italian aircraft; many more were damaged. After this battle, the Regia Aeronautica was no longer an effective force within the theatre.Gustavsson, H√•kan. \\"Flight Lieutenant Marmaduke Thomas St. John Pattle, D.F.C.

On 4 March 1941, a single G.50 bis was responsible for the shooting down of Hurricane V7288, piloted by Australian RAF ace Flight Lieutenant Nigel Cullen (who was credited with 15 or 16 victories) off Valona coast (Albania), while he was flying as wing-man for ace Pat Pattle. During the course of the Greek campaign, a flight of 10 G.50 fighters were recorded as having been lost, including both combat losses and others that had been destroyed by a combination of accidents and as a consequence of Allied bombing missions against Italian airfields. =Sicilian and Italian campaigns= During the second half of the war, the G.50 was typically operated as a multi-role fighter and ground attack aircraft, equipped only with external bombs.Sgarlato 2004, pp. 33‚Äì34. During the opening phase of the Allied invasion of Sicily, the G.50 was the most numerous aircraft used by the Regia Aeronautica to counterattack the Allied landings.Massimello and Apostolo 2000, p. 25. Just prior to the start of the invasion, the a specialised ground attack unit of the Regia Aeronautica, 50¬∞ Stormo Assalto, was repositioned to Southern Italy; this unit was equipped with G.50 bis fighter-bombers. As soon the invasion started, on 10 July 1943, additional units were rushed to the area to participate in the Axis counter- attack.Shores 1977, p. 117. Alongside various other Italian and German ground attack units, 45 G.50 bis of 158 and 159 Gruppi Assalto from Pistoia were committed to attack Allied naval assets, landing craft and troops. Ten of these saw action on 11 July in conjunction with several Re.2002s and escorted by five Re.2005s of 362a Squadron, when they were intercepted by an overwhelming fighter \\"umbrella\\". In the ensuing engagement, three G.50s were shot down, including Tenente Colonnello (Wing Commander) Guido Nobili, commander of 5 Stormo Assalto.Shores 1977, p. 118. The remainder of the Italian air forces returned to their base where, after landing, the fighters were mostly destroyed on the ground by a follow-up air attack. By the time of the Italian Armistice with the Allies, only a handful of G.50 fighters were left in service in Italy. A number of these continued to be operated as part of the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force, while at least four G.50s were used by the Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana as fighter trainers. The top-scoring Italian pilot to use the G.50 was Furio Lauri, who was credited with 11 \\"kills\\" prior to the end of 1941, eventually achieving a final score of 18 enemy aircraft downed.Spick 1999 =In Finnish service= Fiat G.50 in Finnish markings, c. 1940 The G.50 saw its longest and most successful service in the two Finnish wars against the Soviet Union, the Winter War of 1939‚Äì1940 and the Continuation War of 1941‚Äì1944. At the end of 1939, before the outbreak of hostilities, Finland ordered 35 Fiat G.50s. The first 10 aircraft were to be delivered before February 1940. A group of Finnish pilots attended a 10-hour training course at Guidonia airport and later at Fiat Aviazione in Turin. On a training flight, during a dive from , Lieutenant Tapani Harmaja reached an estimated speed of , which was considered excessive for the structural integrity of the aircraft. The windscreen was damaged.Fatutta, Francesco. \\"La guerra d'Inverno\\" (in Italian). RiD Magazine, Coop Riviera Ligure, 12/1989 p. 96.Arena 1996, p. 477. Germany hindered the transit of the aircraft, so they were dismantled and embarked in La Spezia on the Norwegian ship Braga, which set sail for Turku, Finland, on 20 January.Arena 1996, p. 478. Because of this delay, the first G.50s did not reach No. 26 Squadron, Finnish Air Force (HLeLv 26) at Utti until February 1940.Neulen 2000, p. 201. The G.50s were numbered from FA-1 to FA-35, but it seems that only 33 were delivered. Squadron No 26 received from material command G.50 fighters according to the table below. A day before the truce after the Winter War, they had received 30 Fiat G.50s of the 35 purchased and 33 not damaged during the procurement. Fiat G.50 FA-8 was destroyed during take-off when the pilot, a Hungarian volunteer, second lieutenant Wilhelm Bekasy, in bad flying weather, lost contact with his countryman, lieutenant Matias Pirity, who turned back. The next day sergeant Asser Wallenius took-off with FA-7, having forgotten to switch on the fuel pump of the main tank and as the extra fuel tanks emptied, FA-7 crashed and was damaged. Wallenius survived but he was injured. Because of technical problems in the Finnish airforce itself, only 33 of the 35 Fiat G.50s were delivered to Finland. The Italian fighters had arrived too late to affect the course of that year's winter battles, however, most of them were soon sent to the front. The Fiat pilots found themselves involved in the heavy fighting over the bay of Vyborg in late February and early March. According to some sources, the first kill was achieved on 26 February. The following day, Second Lieutenant Malmivuo became the first Finnish pilot to be killed in a G.50, when his fighter FA-12 crashed after a battle with Soviet aircraft. And on 11 March, the Italian volunteer Sergente Dario Manzocchi crashed to his death while returning from a combat sortie. The Fiat bases were under constant attack. The Utti airfield was bombed by the Soviet airforce. Consequently, the Fiats were transferred two kilometres to the northwest of Utti proper, onto the ice at Haukkaj√§rvi (Falcon lake). As Haukkaj√§rvi became bombed and attacked by fighters, another lake-side base was established near the city of Lahti, Hollola, also on the ice of Vesij√§rvi near Pyh√§niemi manor. Overall, HLeLv 26 achieved 11 kills, against one loss in combat and another in an accident. The Finnish G.50 y were taken from the 235 built by CMASA, both Serie I and Serie II, but all but seven had the open cockpit of the Serie II, a feature that Finnish pilots disliked, especially in winter. There were some attempts to improve the aircraft ‚Äì one was tested with an enclosed cockpit, another with a D.XXI ski-undercarriage ‚Äì but none of the modifications were put into service. Better protection for the propeller, which had problems at extremely low temperatures, and a few other changes were introduced. The speed of the Finnish G.50s was around , much lower than the standard series could achieve.Mattioli, Marco. \\"Il G.50 nella Guerra d'Inverno\\" (in Italian). Aerei nella Storia magazine, Parma, January 2000, pp. 32‚Äì35. At this stage, Finnish pilots preferred the Hawker Hurricane, the French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 and the Brewster F2A Buffalo to the G.50.Arena 1996, p. 479.

Retrieved: 26 September 2010. In 1941, HLeLv 26 claimed 52 victories for the loss of only two fighters. The Soviets brought better, newer types of fighter to the front line in 1942 and 1943, while the Fiats were becoming old and run-down and the lack of spare parts meant that pilots were restricted to a minimal number of sorties. Nevertheless, between 30 November 1939 and 4 September 1944, the G.50s of HLeLv 26 shot down 99 enemy aircraft, including aircraft more modern than they, such as the British fighters sent to the USSR. In the same period, Finnish squadrons lost 41 aircraft of several types. But Fiat lost in combat were just three, with a ratio victory/loss of 33/1. The most successful Finnish G.50 pilots were Oiva Tuominen (23 victories), Olli Puhakka (11Shores 1983, p. 105. or 13), according to other sources, Nils Trontti (6), Onni Paronen (4), Unto Nieminen (4) and Lasse Lautam√§ki (4). The Finnish G.50s were finally phased out of front-line duty in the summer of 1944. They were no more than 10 or 12, and even as trainers, they did not last long, since they lacked spare parts. Unlike the older MS.406, there was no effort to change their engine to make them better and faster. The last G.50 was struck off the inventory on 13 December 1946, at the FAF flight academy in Kauhava.Lembo, DanieleG.50 nella Guerra d'Inverno, Aerei nella Storia magazine, Delta Editions, Parma, p.36Keskinen, Kalevi; Stenman, Kari: Suomen ilmavoimien historia 8 ‚Äì Fiat G.50.

On 12 June 1942, the Fiat G.50 bis fighters took off from Fiat Aviazione in Turin for Croatia, but before they reached the border, they were stopped on the orders of Ugo Cavallero, Chief of the Italian Supreme Command, who feared that the Croatian pilots would defect. The G.50s had to wait until 25 June before being delivered to the Croatian Air Force,Arena 1996, pp. 485‚Äì488. which assigned them to the 16th Jato at Banja LukaNeulen 2000, p. 177. and were intensively used until 1945 against Yugoslav Partisans, at first in Bosnia and Herzegovina, then in Serbia, Croatia and Dalmatia. During 1942, a Croatian G.50 bis squadron was transferred from Northern Yugoslavia to the Ukrainian front, flanking the 4th Luftflotte.Malizia 2008, p. 200 On 25 June 1943, the Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Drzave Hrvatske (Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia, or ZNDH), received nine G.50 bis fighters and one G.50B. In October, while based at Zalu≈æani airfield, Banja Luka, they flew many strafing missions against partisans for nearly a year.Savic and Ciglic 2002, p. 61 After the Italian armistice of 8 September 1943, the Luftwaffe supplied the Croatian Air Force Legion with 20‚Äì25 Fiat G.50s captured on Regia Aeronautica airfields in the Balkans. These equipped two Croatian fighter units, but by the end of 1943 only 10 aircraft remained. Three G.50s captured after the Armistice were loaned to Kro JGr 1 at the beginning of 1944.Savic and Ciglic 2002, p. 68 In 1944 some of the G.50s were operated at the Brezice training school. ZNDH entered 1945 with seven G.50s (two operational). On 10 March 1945 six of these Fiats were based in Lucko, operated by 2.LJ (Lovacka Grupa, Fighter Group). Three were damaged by RAF Mustangs of Nos 213 and 249 Squadrons attacking Lucko airfield with napalm bombs, on 25 March, and the following day one of the last operative Freccia was flown to a RAF-held airfield by vod (Corporal) Ivan Misulin that defected, together with vod Korhut (flying a Bf 109 G-10).Savic and Ciglic 2002, p. 69 The last G.50s were captured by Yugoslav Partisans.

Lina Inverse is a young yet very powerful sorceress travelling the world in search of adventure and treasure. Lina has been consistently voiced by Megumi Hayashibara in Japanese. She is voiced by Lisa Ortiz in the English version of the TV series produced by Central Park Media and Funimation Entertainment, and by Cynthia Martinez in ADV Films-produced English version of the films and original video animation episodes. Slayers novels and anime are narrated by Lina herself from her point of view. Lina was one of the most popular anime characters of the late 1990s and has since retained a sizable fan following. There have been also characters based on or inspired by her in both Slayers and in other works. Creation and design An artwork of Audrey Hepburn Slayers creator Hajime Kanzaka has originally created the characters of Lina and Luna (Lina's unseen sister in Slayers) as the heroines of his science-fiction story that he had written when he was in high school and in which Luna was the protagonist and Lina was her clone. While creating her visual design, Slayers illustrator and visual designer Rui Araizumi was inspired when he by chance came upon a vintage film with the actress Audrey Hepburn on TV. Lina has a petite body type and is 147 cm (4 feet 10 inches) tall. She has two moles on her forehead, which are usually covered by her headband. Despite her supposed to be having a very flat chest, so much she can be confused for a boy, Lina is often depicted by Araizumi with larger breasts due to his personal preferences, which would be then carried over to much of other media too. Lina's appearance whilst wearing her homeland's folk clothing in the film Slayers: The Motion Picture is a nod to Ranma Saotome, the titular character from Ranma 1/2, who too (like Lina) is voiced by Megumi Hayashibara in Japanese. Character and appearances =Lina Inverse= Lina Inverse was born in the fictional country of Zephilia. Since her mother used to be a mercenary magic user, Lina, suffering from inferiority complex to her sister, decided she would like to be a sorceress and coaxed her parents to send her to the Sorcerer's Guild school. Her older sister, the Knight of Shiphied Luna Inverse, was the darling of both her parents and the town, excelling in martial studies and quickly beginning to make a name for herself. Although Lina has faced down dragons, monsters, and even dark lords with little fear, the mere mention of Luna's name sends her into terrified hysterics. When Lina was a child, she sold images of Luna naked in order to earn money and, in turn, Luna punished Lina so severely that Lina has feared her ever since.Slayers Revolution episode 8. Lina has many different nicknames, including \\"Bandit Killer\\" and \\"Dragon Spooker\\", neither of which she likes. To her, her most embarrassing nickname is \\"Lina the Pink\\", which is her official title amongst the Guild.Slayers The Ruby Eye by Hajime Kanzaka, chapter 2. In the light novel, manga, film and OVA prequel stories, Lina meets an unhinged and secretive sorceress calling herself Naga the Serpent and maniacally obsessed with Lina, with whom she then travels with and often ends up fighting against during their adventures. During that time, Lina earns her reputation of someone who tracks and destroys numerous bandits for fun and profit, stealing their ill-gotten gains for their own use. In Slayers Revolution, Lina embarks on pirate hunting after bandits have become an \\"endangered species\\". According to Kanzaka, Lina and her self-proclaimed rival Naga are the mightiest human magic users in the world of Slayers; while Naga has a larger potential magical capacity, Lina knows the ultimate black magic spells, notably the devastating Dragon Slave, which is her famed signature attack. Although she is an adolescent (between 15 and 17Dragon Magazine October 1994, p.9. years old in most stories), she is an extremely powerful mage, with a great love for money, treasure (especially the magical sort) and food. In the anime and manga (but not the light novels), Lina recklessly uses overly destructive magic, often with little provocation (though depicted lightheartedly). As such, she is widely reputed to be an evil and calamitous \\"Enemy of All Who Live\\", among many other similar monikers (such as \\"Empress of Destruction\\", \\"Natural Disaster Mage\\", \\"Raven-Black Witch\\" and \\"No-Breasts Demon\\"). In spite of her infamy and an underdeveloped body, Lina likes to see herself as a genial, dignified, and beautiful sorceress. As analyzed by the NTUT's John Lance Griffith, \\"to the extent that Lina is an independent, powerful woman ('a girl today' in contrast to the traditional Japanese woman), she follows in the tradition of Western lady knights and sorceresses: the tradition of Spenser's Britomart, of Tolkien's Arwen and Eowyn. But given the world she lives in (and to the extent that it reflects the world we live in) perhaps we are meant to understand that she can only be so noble and so charitable before she has to re-enter the war of all against all.\\" Adding to her mental instability, she is also selfish, short-tempered and gluttonous, and suffers an inferiority complex over her chest size, especially when alongside the very busty Naga who likes to taunt Lina over this. Lina's accomplishments include the destruction of a piece of Shabranigdo and having a hand in the destruction of the demon lords including the dragon demon lords Gaav and Hellmaster Phibrizzo, as well as defeating the great cosmic evil Dark Star. Due to these accomplishments, she is increasingly piquing the interest of the Mazoku demon kind and has become a frequent target. At the beginning of the main series, Lina meets a swordsman named Gourry Gabriev and a chimera boy named Zelgadis Greywords. Lina encounters and destroys a part of the Mazoku Lord Shabranigdo with her ultimate Giga Slave spell, which draws power from the Lord of Nightmares, the highest deity of the Slayers universe, but has no plans to ever use it again after almost ending the world. She befriends a princess named Amelia Wil Tesla Seyruun and the priestess Sylphiel Nels Lahda. She later meets a mysterious priest Xellos and gets caught between Chaos Dragon Gaav and Hellmaster Phibrizzo. In the anime-exclusive series Slayers Try, Lina is recruited by the dragoness Filia Ul Copt to save the world. In Slayers Revolution, Lina gets arrested on false pretense which later comes leading her on a journey against another incarnation of the Demon Beast Zannafar. She also meets an odd little creature named Pokota, who too has the ability to use the Dragon Slave. Lina and Gourry have traveled with each other ever since they met, and they have been featured in every form of Slayers media that takes place in the timeline after they meet. Lina appears to fall in love with Gourry, once even risking the destruction of the universe in order to save him.Slayers NEXT episode 26. There is a distinct lack of romantic development in the series, even after it is affirmed that Lina and Gourry love each other. Kanzaka addressed this by jokingly stating that he is not adept in writing romantic scenes. The final climax of Slayers Next, the second season of the Slayers TV series, the two characters share a kiss, though they cannot later recall the incident. However, both Gourry and Lina remember that something important had happened between them. In any media taking place after the two met, they have been featured together and should they ever get separated, are never apart for too long. The audio drama Slayers Kita Kaette EX #4, which provides a pseudo-closure to the entire Slayers saga (since it was made before Slayers Evolution-R), features the retired Lina and Naga, both now elderly in their eighties (with almost all other characters already deceased) and vacationing together while still quarreling and fighting each other. Lina is also the main protagonists through the entire official series of the uncanonical Slayers role-playing video games from the 1990s, and further appears as a player character or an avatar option in the role-playing video games Heroes Phantasia and Fantasia Re:build, with Naga in the action video game Magical Battle Arena and in the role-playing video game Valkyrie Anatomia, with Gourry in the role-playing video game La Tale and again in Valkyrie Anatomia, with both Naga and Gourry in the role-playing video game Granblue Fantasy, and with them as well other Slayers main characters in LINE Rangers and Puzzle & Dragons. Her character has been also featured in a range of Slayers merchandise, including various figures, licensed cosplay outfits, and a perfume line. =Derived characters= In the science fiction themed Lost Universe, Kanzaka's another media franchise, the traits and personas of Lina and Gourry were mixed together to create its male protagonist, Kain Blueriver. Several different versions of Lina populate the Slayers world itself, due to various plots. In one story from the prequels, Lina and Naga are exposed to a mirror that creates an exact opposite of whoever looks in it. The wizard using it expects this to produce dark and violent version of the two that would side with him and destroy the originals, but the mirror copies turn out sweet, kind, generous, and extremely concerned about the feelings of each other and everyone around them. In their attempts to break the spell, Lina and Naga actually wind up creating dozens of such doppelg√§ngers of themselves, which go on to found an entire village full of philanthropic Linas and Nagas. A slightly adapted version of this story, which resulted in the mirror being destroyed without creating more than the initial copies, served as the basis of the Slayers Special OAV episode \\"Mirror Mirror\\". In the Slayers TV series, Gourry and Lina are both the subject of an attempt at cloning, which spawns a number of miniature, super deformed versions of them both; the tiny clones fight to humorous effect, and after the mini Linas win, they all disintegrate. Even more, in this case mostly lifelike, clones of Lina were created by Xellos' master Zellas Metallium in the video game Slayers in which one of them, who believes herself to be the real Lina, is a playable character and the game's initial protagonist. In the film Slayers Great, a super deformed, giant, toylike fighting golem named \\"Piko-Piko Lina-chan\\" is constructed in a distorted image of Lina's that emphasises her kawaii (cute) attributes, much to Lina's dismay and anger as she believed she had been chosen to model for its creation because of her (self-imagined) great beauty. It is also featured in the video game Slayers Royal 2. Reception As a popular character, Lina has also became a subject of cosplay Lina Inverse has become a popular and critically praised character both in Japan and overseas; writing in 1999, Dave Halverson called Slayers' Lina and Naga \\"two of anime [medium]'s brightest stars in both Japan and the U.S.\\"Gamers' Republic issue 7, page 120. Lina won Animage magazine's Anime Grand Prix 1998 award for the best female character of 1997, also placing second in 1997 (after Rei Ayanami, also voiced by Megumi Hayashibara), fourth in 1996, and eight in 1999. In 2000, she won the Best of Dragon Magazine popular vote in two categories, including at first place in best female hero.Dragon Magazine January 2001 issue. In 2004, readers of the Japanese magazine Animedia voted her the seventh most popular female character in the Animedia 23rd Anniversary Anime Awards.Animedia July 2004 issue. Retrospectively, Japanese magazine Famitsu declared her the 15th top anime heroine of the 1990s. In 2020, from Anthony Gramuglia from Comic Book Resources ranked her and Usagi Tsukino from Sailor Moon as the best anime heroines of the 1990s, describing them as \\"two fantastic characters who have remained popular and iconic for decades.\\" The voice of Lina Inverse has since remained one of Hayashibara's best known roles. Lina's local dubbing also became one of the most popular roles of Emanuela Pacotto in Italy. Lina has been also included in many top lists by various websites. For example, The Mary Sue's Citlin Donovan included her among \\"Six Leading Ladies of Shonen Anime\\" and the SBS PopAsia's Jamaica dela Cruz named her as number one \\"baddest anime female\\". Anime News Network's Lynzee Loveridge put \\"Lina Inverse and Company\\" at second spot in \\"Traditional Fantasy Parties\\", while Gia Manry from the same website ranked her first among all anime's \\"Easiest Good Guys to Make Angry\\", as well as placing Lina second on her lists of \\"Destroyers of the Fourth Wall\\" and \\"Most Destructive Heroes\\". =Cultural impact= The character's enduring popularity led to several cameo appearances in various other media, including the role-playing game Ironclaw (a fangame style homage on the First Edition cover, along with Naga), the video game Shadow Warrior (in an in-game poster), and in the first episode of the anime series Full Metal Panic! (shown on a cover of Dragon Magazine). The protagonists of the 2002 anime miniseries Cosplay Complex, Chako and Reika, dress up as Naga and Lina in the third episode, and Lina and Naga also made a cameo appearance in French comic book series Les L√©gendaires Origines in 2014. A Slayers-inspired player character Lina is part of the Dota video game series: in the Warcraft III mod Defense of the Ancients, she shares the name of \\"Lina Inverse\\", while simply going by \\"Lina\\" in Dota 2 and is referred to as \\"Lina the Slayer\\" in the games lore; in both games, she is a redhead whose spells' names reference these in Slayers: \\"Dragon Slave\\", \\"Light Strike Array\\" (Explosion Array), and \\"Laguna Blade\\" (Ragna Blade). Lina and her \\"Dragon Slave\\" are also parodied in the 2012 anime series Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions (in the episode \\"Regret of... the Scriptures of Darkness (Mabinogion)\\") and in the 2015 American animated series Star vs. the Forces of Evil (in the episode \\"The Battle for Mewni\\").

The commission was created in response to a December 1974 report in The New York Times that the CIA had conducted illegal domestic activities, including experiments on U.S. citizens, during the 1960s. The commission issued a single report in 1975, touching upon certain CIA abuses including mail opening and surveillance of domestic dissident groups.

The conspiracy was the first of many subsequent coup attempts against elected governments in the history of Pakistan. The coup was planned by Major-General Akbar Khan, a senior commander in the Pakistani army, in conjunction with 15 other military officers and left-wing Pakistani politicians. Causes Main causes of Rawaplindi conspiracy case (busted on 9 March 1951) were three. One, a general discontent of Army's Pakistani Officers with the performance of the Liaqat Ali Khan's Government, whom they thought of as corrupt and incompetent. Two, many of the high ranking Pakistani Generals viewed the continuing presence of British Army Officers in the army as a security threat, as well as an impediment to their speedy promotions. Third, and most immediate cause was their discontent with Liaqat regime's handling of the Kashmir war with India (1948). Army officers thought Government's acceptance of UN mediation and ceasefire, as a 'tame surrender' and 'flouting an opportunity to capture whole of Kashmir'. Several Pakistan Army officers who had fought the Kashmir war, were ethnic Kashmiris and owned land in the contested province. Maj. General Akbar Khan (who was the master mind behind the Rawalpindi Conspiracy) had communist leanings, which explains why he enlisted the support of communist/leftists intellectuals of Pakistan. e.g. Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Syed Sajjad Zaheer (Secretary General of Pakistan Communist Party). Whether USSR was actively involved in this conspiracy is not supported by any evidence. This conspiracy had no connection with Pakistan's joining SEATO or CENTO, as both these international bodies came into being much later (in 1954 and 1955, respectively).'Hasan Zaheer (1998). The times and trial of the Rawalpindi conspiracy 1951: the first coup attempt in Pakistan. Oxford University Press. . Participants Eleven military officers and four civilians were involved in the conspiracy. The main person responsible for planning the coup was Maj. Gen. Akbar Khan, the chief of general staff of the Pakistani army. During the 1947 war, Khan had led Pakistani forces under the pseudonym of \\"General Tariq.\\" He was based in the northern city of Rawalpindi, where the army headquarters were located, while the political capital of the state was in the southern city of Karachi at the time. The civilian conspirators included leading Pakistani poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz, who was notably active in left-wing politics and sympathetic to the Communist Party of Pakistan, and Sajjad Zaheer. Akbar Khan's wife, Naseem Shahnawaz Khan, was also believed to have motivated her husband to undertake this plot. Exposure and trial The conspiracy was foiled after the government was informed of the coup attempt by one of the confidantes of Akbar Khan. Government forces immediately arrested Maj. Gen. Akbar Khan and the other conspirators, including Faiz Ahmed Faiz. The army commander-in-chief, Gen. Muhammad Ayub Khan and the defence secretary Maj. Gen. Iskander Mirza had both remained loyal to the government. Ayub Khan immediately ordered the army troops to surround and take control of the army headquarters, where Maj. Gen. Akbar Khan was based. Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan announced the foiling of the coup on 9 March 1951. The government passed the Rawalpindi Conspiracy (Special Tribunal) Act to set up a special tribunal to investigate the conspiracy. A trial was held for the 15 individuals accused, namely ‚Äì Maj. Gen. Akbar Khan, Air Commodore M. K. Janjua, Maj. Gen. Nazir Ahmed, Brigadier Sadiq Khan, Brigadier M. A. Latif Khan, Lt. Col. Zia-ud-Din, Lt. Col. Niaz Muhammad Arbab, Captain Khizar Hayat, Maj. Hassan Khan, Major Ishaq Muhammad, Captain Zafrullah Poshni, Mrs. Naseem Akbar Khan, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Syed Sajjad Zaheer and Muhammad Hussain Ata. After an 18-month trial conducted in secrecy, Maj. Gen. Khan and Faiz Ahmed Faiz were both convicted and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. Their defence lawyer was the notable Bengali Muslim politician Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy. When Suhrawardy became the Prime Minister of Pakistan in 1957, he obtained a reprieve for most of the conspirators. Aftermath Major General Akbar Khan was soon rehabilitated in Pakistani political life, becoming an adviser to Pakistani politician Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Upon coming to power in 1971, Bhutto appointed Akbar Khan as the chief of national security. Faiz continued to publish many works of poetry, and was appointed to the National Council for Arts by the Bhutto government. Gen. Ayub Khan launched the first successful military coup against the government of President Iskander Mirza in 1958, assuming the reins of the presidency himself until 1969. Liaquat Ali Khan was assassinated later in 1951, in October, in an unrelated attack by an Afghan in Rawalpindi.

It was first introduced at the NAMM Show on March 21, 2003. Ernie Ball president Sterling Ball designed the instrument in conjunction with the Music Man Research and Development department and BMW's Designworks team. It is equipped with an 18-volt 4-band preamp (except on the single-pickup model, which has a 3-band preamp; single-pickup models with piezo bridges have a 4-band preamp) designed by Dudley Gimpel with help from Cliff Hugo and other Music Man artists. It also sports a sleek, carved basswood body with high- gloss polyester finish and a satin-finish painted 34\\" scale maple neck with rosewood fingerboard (pau ferro on lined or unlined fretless, ebony on both fretted and fretless \\"stealth\\" basses) featuring 24 high-profile wide frets and crescent moon-shaped position inlays. These basses are generally known for their dual humbucking pickup configuration, as they are the first twin humbucker-equipped models released by Music Man since the introduction of their Sabre and Cutlass bass guitars in the late 1970s. The Bongo is available with four, five, and since 2008, six strings, fretted and fretless lined or unlined, with neodymium H (single humbucker), HS (bridge humbucker/neck single-coil) and HH (dual humbuckers) pickup configurations. A bridge with piezoelectric pickups is available on all models except left-handed and six- string versions. On all multiple-pickup models there is a blend control rather than the selection switch found on other Music Man basses (piezo models have an additional blend control for the piezo bridge). The pickup placement on the H model is in the \\"sweet spot\\" that is characteristic of Music Man basses. The placement on the multiple-pickup models, however, differs from all of the company's other basses. Both the bridge and neck pickups are set closer to the bridge, probably in part because of space constraints due to the Bongo's 24-fret neck. The combination of a relatively lightweight, resonant basswood body, neodymium pickups and 18-volt preamp give the Bongo a distinctive tonal character that is markedly different from other Music Man basses, which have none of these features.

It was released in the United States on 11 August 1969 (Epic Records BN 26481 (stereo)), but was not released in the United Kingdom because of a continuing contractual dispute that also prevented Sunshine Superman, Mellow Yellow, and The Hurdy Gurdy Man from being released in the UK. History While the majority of the Barabajagal sessions took place in November 1968, \\"Happiness Runs\\" and \\"Where Is She\\" were recorded the previous May. All of these songs except \\"Atlantis\\", \\"I Love My Shirt\\" and \\"To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\\" were shelved while Donovan's Greatest Hits was still high in the charts. \\"Atlantis\\" / \\"I Love My Shirt\\" was released as a single in November 1968 in the UK. In the US, \\"To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\\" / \\"Atlantis\\" was released in March 1969. \\"Atlantis\\" ended up charting higher than its a-side. Some of the songs recorded were originally meant to be included on the unreleased Moon in Capricorn album. In May 1969, Mickie Most produced at least one session with Donovan fronting the Jeff Beck Group. \\"Goo Goo Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)\\" (also known as \\"Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)\\" and simply \\"Barabajagal\\") and \\"Trudi\\" (originally \\"Bed with Me\\") resulted from these sessions. There were other songs recorded by Donovan and the Jeff Beck Group, but they remained unreleased until they appeared as bonus tracks on the 2005 UK reissue of the album. Rod Stewart was in the band at this time, but he does not sing lead on any of the songs that were released. Tony Newman is featured as drummer. \\"Goo Goo Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)\\" / \\"Trudi\\" was released as a single in June 1969 in the UK and in August 1969 in the United States. Following the pattern of Donovan's previous releases, his next album was named after the hit single of the time. The inclusion of \\"Atlantis\\" and \\"To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\\" helped make Barabajagal a strong seller in the United States. The songs on this album represent all facets of Donovan's career. Several rockers adorn the album, including the title track, \\"Trudi\\", \\"The Love Song\\" and \\"Superlungs (My Supergirl)\\". \\"I Love My Shirt\\" updates the sound of Donovan's children's music, and there are several slow songs featuring breathy vocals (\\"Where Is She?\\", \\"To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\\") reminiscent of the For Little Ones portion of A Gift from a Flower to a Garden. It is during the Barabajagal sessions that Donovan's musical vision and work ethic began to diverge from that of producer Mickie Most. The two eventually stopped working together, effectively ending Donovan's chart success. \\"Happiness Runs\\" is a round sung by Donovan, Graham Nash, Michael McCartney, and Lesley Duncan and was originally released without the round as \\"Pebble and the Man\\" on Donovan in Concert. \\"Superlungs (My Supergirl)\\" was originally recorded during the Sunshine Superman sessions, but was not used for that album. That recording was released on Troubadour The Definitive Collection 1964‚Äì1976. Donovan re-recorded the song for Barabajagal.

Founded as Russell Creek Academy,University Catalog, 2009‚Äì2011 edition. a Baptist institution, the university currently enrolls more than 12,000 students and is open to students of all denominations. The university offers associate, bachelor's, and master's degrees. In 2014, the university trustees ended its covenant agreement with the Kentucky Baptist Convention, but vowed to uphold the ideals. History Ransdell Chapel Campbellsville University traces its origins to the founding in 1906 of Russell Creek Academy by the Russell Creek Baptist Association. The Academy gradually developed its offerings and a four- year curriculum, becoming accredited as a college. With an expansion of graduate programs, in 1996 the college gained university status. The president of the university is Michael V. Carter, Ph.D. The immediate past president is Kenneth W. Winters (born 1934). He is a Republican state senator from District 1 based in Murray in southwestern Kentucky. Before Winters, the president was William Randolph \\"Randy\\" Davenport of Campbellsville, who served 1969‚Äì1988. Fuller Harding, an attorney and former state representative from Campbellsville, served on the CU board of trustees for five years. His father, Abel Turner Harding (1881‚Äì1966), had been instrumental in raising funds to establish Russell Creek Academy, the forerunner of Campbellsville College.Calen McKinney, \\"CU Board of Trustees member, Fuller Harding, dies Jan. 10 at 94\\", The Campbellsvillian, Vol. 8 No. 2 (June 2010), p. 19 Forest Shely, a physician in Campbellsville and a 1943 graduate of the former Campbellsville Junior College, served as a trustee of the university for 56 years, from 1954 until his death in 2010.Joan C.

CU's Board Chairman Dr. Joseph L. Owens said, \\"Our actions will allow us to select our own trustees but these decisions in no way change the mission or the character of Campbellsville University. We look forward to discussing the new proposed agreement that will continue CU working with the KBC and its churches in areas of joint mission and ministry in the spirit of the Great Commandment and in following the command of the Great Commission.\\" In February 2017, the CU field house was damaged in a fire. The university will raze the old structure and rebuild on the same spot. The new structure is expected to be available in time for the new football season in mid-August.

He and his business partner Daniel B. Wesson formed two companies named \\"Smith & Wesson\\", the first of which was eventually reorganized into the Winchester Repeating Arms Company and the latter of which became the modern Smith & Wesson. Early career Born in Cheshire, Massachusetts, Smith was employed by the U. S. Armory service from 1824 to 1842, when he moved to Newtown, Connecticut. He was employed by various gun makers up to the 1840s, when he moved to Norwich, Connecticut. He is then listed as a partner of Cranston & Smith. It is known that while in Norwich, he engaged in the manufacture of whaling guns and he is credited with the invention of the explosive bullet used to kill whales. Volcanic Repeating Arms Smith and Daniel B. Wesson formed a partnership in 1852 for the purpose of developing the magazine arms later to be manufactured under the Smith & Wesson name. They founded the Smith & Wesson Company, with Cortlandt Palmer, in Norwich, Connecticut in 1854 to develop magazine firearms and the Volcanic rifle, the first repeating rifle. Smith developed a new Volcanic Cartridge, which he patented in 1854. The Smith & Wesson Company was renamed Volcanic Repeating Arms in 1855, and was financed largely by Oliver Winchester. In 1856, the partners left Volcanic Repeating Arms to begin a new company and to manufacture a newly designed revolver-and-cartridge combination. Volcanic Repeating Arms was reorganized as the New Haven Arms Company and eventually as the Winchester Repeating Arms Company Smith & Wesson In 1857, Smith and Wesson formed another Smith & Wesson company, this time to produce a pistol with interchangeable parts, a repeating action, a revolving magazine, metallic cartridges, and an open cylinder. They developed more firearms using their own patents along with patents and licenses bought from other gunsmiths.Horace Smith and Daniel Baird Wesson BiographyAmerican Business BSA Merit Badge Guide , 22 Jun 2015. Smith sold his interest in the company to Wesson in 1874 at the age of 65 and retired.

Mercedes-Benz has been experimenting with these capabilities for automobile suspension since the air suspension of the 1963 600 and the hydropneumatic (fluid and air) suspension of the 1974 6.9. ABC is only available on rear-wheel drive models. All-wheel drive models are available only with Airmatic semi-active air suspension. Production version introduced at the 1999 Geneva Motor Show on the new Mercedes-Benz CL-Class C215.Mercedes-Benz S-Class, W 220 series (1998 to 2005)  Description  In the ABC system, a computer detects body movement from sensors located throughout the vehicle, and controls the action of the active suspension with the use of hydraulic servomechanisms. The hydraulic pressure to the servos is supplied by a high pressure radial piston hydraulic pump. A total of 13 sensors continually monitor body movement and vehicle level and supply the ABC controller with new data every ten milliseconds. Four level sensors, one at each wheel measure the ride level of the vehicle, three accelerometers measure the vertical body acceleration, one acceleration sensor measures the longitudinal and one sensor the transverse body acceleration. At each hydraulic cylinder, a pressure sensor monitors the hydraulic pressure. As the ABC controller receives and processes data, it operates four hydraulic servos, each mounted in series on a spring strut, beside each wheel. Almost instantaneously, the servo regulated suspension generates counter forces to body lean, dive and squat during various driving maneuvers. A suspension strut, consisting of a steel coil spring and a shock absorber are connected in parallel, as well as a hydraulically controlled adjusting cylinder, are located between the vehicle body and wheel. These components adjust the cylinder in the direction of the suspension strut, and change the suspension length. This creates a force which acts on the suspension and dampening of the vehicle in the frequency range up to five hertz. The reliable function of the ABC system requires a regular hydraulic oil change and filter replacement. The system also incorporates height adjustable suspension, which in this case lowers the vehicle up to between the speeds of for better aerodynamics, fuel consumption, and handling. The ABC system also allows self-levelling suspension, which raises or lowers the vehicle in response to changing load (i.e. the loading or unloading of passengers or cargo). Each vehicle equipped with ABC has an ‚ÄúABC Sport‚Äù button that allows the driver to adjust the suspension range for different driving style preferences. This feature allows the driver to adjust the suspension to maintain a more level ride in more demanding driving conditions. The Mercedes-Benz C112 of 1991, Mercedes-Benz Vario Research Car of 1995 and the Mercedes-Benz F200 of 1996 already featured prototype versions of ABC. The first complete and ready-for-production version of ABC was introduced in 1999 on the top-of-the-line Mercedes-Benz CL-Class In 2010 a crosswind stabilization function was introduced. In strong gusts of crosswind, and depending on the direction and intensity of the wind having an effect on the vehicle, this system varies the wheel load distribution in such a way that the effects of winds are largely compensated or reduced to a minimum. For this purpose the ABC control unit uses the yaw rate, lateral acceleration, steering angle and road speed sensors of the Electronic Stability Program ESP¬Æ. Magic Body Control In 2007, the Mercedes-Benz F700 concept introduced the PRE-SCAN suspension, an early prototype road scanning suspension, using lidar sensors, based on Active Body Control. In 2013 the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W222) introduced the series production version of PRE- SCAN, but with a stereo camera instead of laser projectors. The system dubbed Magic Body Control is fitted with a road-sensing system (Road Surface Scan) that pre-loads the shocks for the road surface detected. Using a stereo camera, the system scans the road surface up to 15 meters ahead of the vehicle at speeds up to , and it adjusts the shock damping at each wheel to account for imperfections in the road. Initially only available on 8-cylinder models and above, Magic Ride Control attempts to isolate the car's body by predicting rather than reacting to broken pavement and speed humps. The ABC has undergone major modifications for the new S-Class: the wheel damping is now continuously adjustable, the spring strut response has been improved and the pump efficiency has been further enhanced. A digital interface connects the control unit and the sensors, while the fast FlexRay bus connects the control unit and the vehicle electronics. Processing power is more than double that of the previous system.http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-1549267-1-1597435-1-0-0-0-0-0-11702-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0.html Suspension: The world's first suspension system with \\"eyes\\" In 2014 the new C217 S-Class Coupe introduced an update to Magic Body Control, called Active Curve Tilting.http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-1721304-1-1710008-1-0-0-1710107-0-1-12759-614216-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html Under the microscope: Curve tilting function - Curve artist This new system allows the vehicle to lean up to 2.5 degrees into a turn, similar to a tilting train.

Their work was characterized by its \\"rock against rock\\" slogan, and defied classification with its incorporation of marching band routines, puppet shows, and the playing of household items as tuned instruments. Adopting the Idiot Flesh moniker in 1987, they went on to release three full-length albums before disbanding in 1998. Founding members Nils Frykdahl and Dan Rathbun later played in Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, while Gene Jun later joined the Sun and Moon Ensemble. History The group formed in Barrington Hall, a student co- op at the University of California at Berkeley, in 1985 as Acid Rain. Guitarist and composer Frykdahl (\\"Pin\\"), bassist Rathbun (\\"The Improver\\"), and guitarist and violinist Jun (\\"Captain Dragon\\") formed the group's core lineup, along with early drummers David Shamrock and Daniel Roth. Their demo album We Were All Very Worried was released as a cassette-only edition in 1987. They changed their name to Idiot Flesh prior to the release of their first vinyl album, Tales of Instant Knowledge and Sure Death, in 1990, which also featured drummer/artist Chuck Squier. The band was known to tour the US in a converted city bus with Rathbun as the driver/mechanic, with the windshield destination banner set for \\"HELL.\\" Their live set incorporated stage performers and characters known as the Filthy Rotten Excuse Chickens, \\"a motley bunch that enhances the Idiot Flesh experience with a variety of acrobatics, dancing and pantomime\\". These characters used such stage names as The Minotaurs of Baal, Beefra The Cook, Helpy The Hamburger Bee, Mr. Punch, Hatcha & Datcha: the Siamese Twins, Ming Tsao: Professor of Black Math, Uro Butoh, El Evil, Ward C. Picnic, The Queen of Oakland, and Mumble. The Nothing Show, their second album, appeared in 1993, and drummer Wes Anderson (\\"Hyena Boy\\") replaced Squier. Extensive touring followed, including several runs with the Czech avant-punk band U≈æ Jsme Doma. They also appeared in the movie Oakland Underground, which has around three minutes of a secret Idiot Flesh show, and in which Frykdahl and Jun both had bit parts. The followup, 1997's Fancy, was released on four different formats: digipak, digipak re-press, standard jewel case and hand-made metal slipcase, the latter in very limited quantity. Although work began on an unnamed fourth album, it has yet to surface. Their final show was held on Friday, March 13, 1998, at the Transmission Theater in San Francisco. The group disbanded shortly thereafter. Frykdahl, Rathbun and Shamrock went on to form Sleepytime Gorilla Museum with Carla Kihlstedt, with whom they and Anderson had worked in Charming Hostess. Frykdahl also became a core member of the group Faun Fables with Dawn McCarthy. Jun later formed the jam band BARGOOMA!! and joined the Sun and Moon Ensemble. Anderson went on to work with Les Claypool, Cirque du Soleil, The Fuxedos, Casino Royale, Kehoe Nation, and Schloss.

It is called a 'stripper' clip because, after the bolt is opened and the stripper clip is placed in position (generally by placing it in a slot on either the receiver or bolt), the user presses on the cartridges from above, sliding them down and off the clip, thereby \\"stripping\\" them off the clip and into the magazine. Stripper clips differ from en bloc clips in that they are not designed to be inserted into the weapon itself, but only to load it or its magazine. Stripper clips were originally employed in infantry bolt action rifles, such as the Russian Mosin‚ÄìNagant, the British Lee‚ÄìEnfield, and the German Gewehr 98 and its variant the Mauser K98k, the related US M1903 Springfield and many others. Stripper clips were also employed in newer, semi-automatic rifles with internal box magazines, such as the Soviet SKS, and the Egyptian Hakim Rifle. Currently they are used to top-off detachable box magazines for semi-automatic and automatic rifles. A magazine loader is placed on the lip of the box magazine, the clip is placed inside the loader, and then the rounds are pushed into the magazine.  Use  Stripper clip loading for a 7.92√ó57mm Mauser Karabiner 98k rifle It is called a \\"stripper\\" clip because, after the bolt is opened and the stripper clip is placed in position (generally by placing it in a slot on either the receiver or bolt), the user presses on the cartridges from above, sliding them down and off the clip, thereby stripping them off the clip and into the magazine. After the magazine is loaded, the stripper clip is removed and set aside for reloading, or simply discarded during combat. Generally, a weapon that can use a stripper clip for loading can also be loaded one round at a time, while a weapon designed for an en bloc clip cannot be used without the clip. Depending on the firearm, magazine, and cartridge, stripper clips come in a variety of shapes, some quite complex, though most are either straight or crescent-shaped pieces of stamped metal‚Äîusually brass, steel (often blued or parkerized), or plastic.  History  Stripper/charger clips have been used since 1889 (in the form of the Mauser Model 1889), while en bloc clips have been used since roughly the mid-late 1880s. En bloc clips, as used in the M1 Garand as well as the Italian Carcano are designed to be inserted into the magazine itself, essentially forming part of the loaded working magazine, while stripper clips are intended purely to load ammunition into the magazine. The M1891 Three Line Rifle (the first \\"Mosin-Nagant\\") utilized stripper clips, however the design was improved upon later by Mauser. Mauser clips are inherently smoother and are ejected automatically upon closing the bolt, while Mosin-Nagant clips require a special technique to get anywhere near the same efficiency and must be manually removed before the bolt can be closed. Still, both are faster than reloading with single cartridges. Moreover, once some but not all rounds have been fired en bloc clip format guns are as a rule difficult or impossible to top-up to their maximum capacity again with additional cartridges, which is generally easy with stripper-clip loading weapons. Stripper clips were originally employed in infantry bolt action rifles, such as the Russian Mosin‚ÄìNagant, the British Lee‚ÄìEnfield, and the German Gewehr 98 and its variant the Mauser K98k, the related US M1903 Springfield and many others. Stripper clips were also employed in newer, semi- automatic rifles with internal box magazines, such as the Soviet SKS and Egyptian Hakim Rifle. Many early semi-automatic pistols also used stripper clips to reload, including the Mannlicher M1894, the Roth‚ÄìSteyr M1907, and the Mauser C96. In modern use, strippers are used to fill detachable box magazines for semi-automatic and automatic rifles. A magazine loader is placed on the lip of the box magazine, a full clip is inserted in the loader and the rounds are pushed into the magazine.

He helped develop several influential firearm designs over the course of his life; he and Horace Smith were the co-founders of two companies named \\"Smith & Wesson\\", the first of which was eventually reorganized into the Winchester Repeating Arms Company and the latter of which became the modern Smith & Wesson. Early years Daniel Baird Wesson was the son of Rufus and Betsey (Baird) Wesson. Daniel's father was a farmer and manufacturer of wooden plows and Daniel worked on his father's farm and attended public school until the age of eighteen, when he apprenticed himself to his brother Edwin Wesson (a leading manufacturer of target rifles and pistols in the 1840s) in Northborough, Massachusetts. Wesson was married to Cynthia Maria Hawes, May 26, 1847, in Thompson, Connecticut. Hawes' father objected to the couple's engagement fearing that Wesson was a \\"mere gunsmith\\" with no future, forcing the couple to elope. Wesson's salary at Smith & Wesson amounted to over $160,000 a year by 1865. The couple had one daughter and three sons: Sarah Jeannette Wesson (1848‚Äì1927); Walter Herbert Wesson (1850‚Äì1921); Frank Luther Wesson (1853‚Äì1887); and Joseph Hawes Wesson (1859‚Äì1920). Frank died in a train accident on the Central Vermont Railway. Walter and Joseph became executives at Smith & Wesson. Smith & Wesson Full-size Volcanic pistol .38 Military and Police, 1899 In 1854, Daniel B. Wesson partnered with Horace Smith and Courtlandt Palmer to develop a lever- action pistol and the first repeating rifle‚Äîthe Volcanic. Production was in the shop of Horace Smith in Norwich, Connecticut. Originally using the name \\"Smith & Wesson Company\\", the name was changed to \\"Volcanic Repeating Arms Company\\" in 1855, with the addition of new investors, one of whom was Oliver Winchester. The Volcanic Repeating Arms Company obtained all rights for the Volcanic designs (both rifle and pistol versions were in production by this time) as well as the ammunition, from the Smith & Wesson Company. Wesson remained as plant manager for eight months before rejoining Smith to found the \\"Smith & Wesson Revolver Company\\" upon obtaining the licensing of the Rollin White \\"rear loading cylinder\\" patent.American Business BSA Merit Badge Guide , 22 Jun 2015. In 1856, Smith & Wesson began to produce a small revolver designed to fire the rimfire cartridge they had patented in August 1854. This revolver was the first successful fully self-contained cartridge revolver available in the world. Smith & Wesson secured patents for the revolver to prevent other manufacturers from producing a cartridge revolver ‚Äì giving the young company a very lucrative business. At the age of 65, Smith retired from the company and sold his share of the business to Wesson, making him the sole owner of the firm. In the late 1800s the company introduced its line of hammerless revolvers, a style that is still produced. In 1899, Smith & Wesson introduced what is arguably the most famous revolver in the world, the .38 Military & Police (renamed the Model 10 in 1957). This revolver has been in continual production since that year and has been used by virtually every police agency and military force around the world.S&W; Model 10 Product page Death and legacy Wesson remained active in the firm until his death. Wesson died at his home in Springfield, Massachusetts, on August 4, 1906‚Äîfollowing a four-year illness, he succumbed to \\"...heart failure, superinduced by neuritis.\\" His wife had died the month prior. The Wessons are buried in Oak Grove Cemetery in Springfield. Wesson, a strong advocate of homeopathy, had funded a new building for the Hampden Homeopathic Hospital in Springfield through a donation of $100,000 in 1904. The hospital, later known as Wesson Memorial Hospital,Postcard image of Wesson Memorial Hospital switched from homeopathy to modern-day medicine in 1923,Springfield, Volume 2, p. 79 (Cruikshank, Ginger, Arcadia Publishing, 2000) and became part of Baystate Medical Center through a merger in 1976. Grandson Douglas B. Wesson worked in the family business and helped create the .357 Magnum in the 1930s. Great-grandson Daniel B. Wesson II followed the family tradition, working in the family business for 30 years and then founding his own company, which later became known as Dan Wesson Firearms. Residences Wesson was involved in the construction of 13 houses. One that is still standing is now known as the Grand Army of the Republic Hall in Worcester, Massachusetts, which was built for his daughter Sarah and was designed by Calvert Vaux. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Wesson also helped fund construction of the French Congregational Church and South Congregational Church, both in Springfield, Massachusetts. =Springfield, Massachusetts= Wesson Mansion in Springfield, Massachusetts Wesson lived and worked in the city of Springfield, Massachusetts, building hospitals and a home there. Wesson‚Äôs primary home was located at 50 Maple Street in Springfield and was the city‚Äôs most extravagant mansion. Wesson hired New York architect Bruce Price to design his residence in the early 1890s. The design was published in The American Architect and Building News in 1893. The house was three and a half stories in height and constructed of pink granite with a red slate roof and bronze cresting and finials. Stylistically, it was adapted from the French chateaux of the Renaissance. Completed in 1898, the house cost between $350,000 and $450,000. Following Wesson's death, the mansion was turned over to the Connecticut Valley Historical Society in 1911, contingent upon the society raising $100,000 for maintenance of the property, which they were unable to do. In 1915, it became the clubhouse for the Colony Club of Springfield, remaining as such until fire destroyed the building on February 20, 1966. =Northborough, Massachusetts= White Cliffs in Northborough, Massachusetts, in September 2019 Wesson had apprenticed in Northborough, Massachusetts, at his brother Edwin's gunsmith shop, and met his future wife there. The business moved to Hartford, Connecticut, in 1848. Later, Wesson built a summer home in Northborough on land partially belonging to his wife's family, which was completed in 1886 a cost of approximately $300,000. It is an example of shingle style architecture. The house had 17 fireplaces and 32 rooms, along with elaborate carvings, stained glass windows, and gas-lit chandeliers. Water for the house and grounds was sourced from a nearby pond, with a pumping station and cistern, fed by approximately of pipe. After Wesson's death in 1906, the house stayed in the family for a few years then was sold in 1910, and subsequently went through multiple owners. It was used as a restaurant as far back as 1946, as a restaurant and function hall until 1985, and later just as a function hall. It was again put up for sale in January 2014, and closed to the public in December 2014. Due to lack of a buyer, it was scheduled to be demolished in 2016. However, the town of Northborough voted in April 2016 to purchase it. The town approved funds to purchase the property at 167 Main Street for $1.75 million, plus additional funding for future development, with a total allocation of $2.4 million.

Life Born Edward Joseph Kloberg III (he added a \\"van\\" to his name in the 1960s and changed it to \\"von\\" on the advice of Arnaud de Borchgrave, who told him it was more \\"distinguished\\") in New York City, he was the son of an engineer who built housing projects. He graduated from Rider College in 1965 and went on to receive a Master's Degree in history at American University. He was then hired by American University as a fundraiser, and was eventually appointed Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid. In 1982, von Kloberg began a public relations and lobbying firm, named van Kloberg & Associates, which was renamed the Washington World Group in 1992. In 1984, he was convicted of filing false financial statements with a Washington bank in connection with loan application. He was sentenced to one year probation. Von Kloberg, who often referred to his clients as \\"the damned,\\" eventually went on to represent Saddam Hussein, Samuel K. Doe of Liberia, Nicolae Ceau≈üescu of Romania, Mobutu S√©s√© Seko of the then-Zaire and the Burmese embassy in the United States. Upon the overthrow of Mobutu, von Kloberg then represented the government of Laurent Kabila, whose forces had pushed Mobutu from power. In 1996, von Kloberg represented the apparel manufacturers of Honduras, who were being accused of sexual abuse and child labor. He later admitted that his clients had been guilty of the accusations, but insisted that his representation of them had led to reforms. Von Kloberg was known for his flamboyant personal style. He affected the title \\"Baron\\", and was frequently seen wearing a black opera cape, either lined with red silk or with silk in a dove pattern, and a sash decorated with medals given to him by clients. He traveled with steamer trunks, and was driven in a black limousine also decorated with medals and badges. The authors of the book Washington Babylon wrote of von Kloberg, \\"Even within the amoral world of Washington lobbying, [he] stands out for handling clients that no one else will touch.\\" Washingtonian magazine once labeled him one of the city's \\"hired guns\\". Von Kloberg himself reveled in the motto, \\"Shame is for sissies.\\" Spy magazine once ran a sting operation against von Kloberg, in which a staff employee posed as a neo-Nazi who advocated the annexation of Poland by Germany. When von Kloberg offered to represent her, the magazine reported on the sting operation under the headline, \\"Washington's Most Shameless Lobbyist\\". Following publication of the story, von Kloberg showed up at the magazine's Washington office wearing a helmet, announcing that he was ready to \\"take the flak\\". In 2001, exiled King Kigeli V of Rwanda invested von Kloberg as a Chevalier Grand Croix of the Royal Order of the Intare. The King called von Kloberg \\"a great friend of Africa and a true aristocrat.\\" Death Von Kloberg committed suicide in 2005 by jumping from the walls of the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome. By this time he was sick and broke. In his pockets were a note for his younger lover, Darius Monkevicius, who had left him, and a magazine cover showing him beside president George H. W.

CAL is a version of the seminal JOSS language with a number of cleanups and new features to take advantage of the SDS platform. The Berkeley SDS was used for the development of the Tymshare commercial time-sharing platform and an improved version of CAL was offered as a programming environment to its customers in 1969. Although CAL saw \\"almost no use\\", it had a lasting impact by influencing the design of Tymshare SUPER BASIC which copied a number of its features. Some of those features, in turn, appeared in BASIC-PLUS on the PDP-11, which is the direct ancestor of Microsoft BASIC.. Description =Basic concepts= JOSS had been designed to be used by non-programmers in the US Air Force and within Rand Corporation, and to aid with that, Rand designed custom computer terminals that were easier to set up and use. These terminals, based on the IBM Selectric typewriter, also included a custom character set that implemented common mathematical symbols like and . To a large degree, CAL was a version of JOSS that replaced these sorts of customizations with more common solutions like and so they could run on common terminals. The other noticeable differences were that CAL was all upper-case, as opposed to sentence casing in JOSS, and it did not require a period at the end of the line. The commands were otherwise almost identical and the overall structure and syntax the same. As with JOSS, CAL had an interactive user interface that allowed the user to type in statements in \\"direct mode\\" or programs to be run in \\"indirect mode\\". In BASIC, the former is more commonly referred to as \\"immediate mode\\". Both CAL and JOSS used a two-part line number, known as the part and step, separated by a period, for instance, for part 1 step 100. Parts were generally used to group related statements into subroutines. In CAL, the part number could be between 0 and 999999, and the step from 0 to 99999. There were two main versions of CAL, released in 1967 and 1969. The following description will be based primarily on the former version unless otherwise noted. =Jumps and subroutines= As in JOSS, CAL supported the command to branch to a provided part or step, as in or , and for subroutine calls, as in to perform the entire part, or to run that single step and then return. The later syntax was useful when there were many small subroutines as they could be implemented on a single line without an associated or similar concept. =Conditional branching and assignment= One of the more notable syntactic features of JOSS was the concept of \\"statement modifiers\\" which controlled the operation of other statements. JOSS used this for conditional branching. In most languages, one would write something to the effect of \\"if this expression is true, then do this...\\". In JOSS, this order was reversed, and such statements took the form \\"do this if this is true\\", for instance, . CAL added some syntactic sugar to this basic concept by adding the new modifier , which, depending on context, led to more obvious code; . CAL further modified the basic if statement by adding and . In JOSS, if one wanted to assign the value 5 to a variable A if the value of B was larger than 10, and 0 otherwise, the code would be: Set A=5 if B>10. Set A=0 if B<=10. This sort of either/or assignment is very common and takes up two lines. CAL improved on JOSS by implementing an ternary assignment operator: A=IF B>10 THEN 5 ELSE 0 A similar modification was the statement, used to set variables as part of an if or for. It was similar in concept to the if/then/else structure, but could have any number of items. For instance,. =Loops= Looping in JOSS was also controlled by a modifier, the . This used somewhat obscure syntax; runs a loop from 1 to 10 stepping by 2, so it would print 1,3,5,7,9. One could also supply explicit values, , or mix the two, CAL improved on JOSS' syntax by introducing the and keywords, so the equivalent code in CAL would be . In JOSS, the parenthesis around the step value was the separator for the two limits, so it could not be made optional. By separating out the limits became explicit and the was made optional as assumed to be 1; . As with JOSS, explicit values and ranges could be used; . CAL further modified the for loop by adding conditional exits, using and . For instance, or . =User-defined functions= JOSS allowed the user to define functions using the statement. The syntax allowed local variables to be named in the function signature; Programs could then call these functions as if they were built-in, CAL changed to , which is much more obvious, and made a more minor change the parameters were passed in using braces instead of parenthesis, so the equivalent definition would be and called in the same way, . A more important change to CAL's functions was the ability to call subroutines from the definitions using , as in . This left the issue of assigning the resulting calculated value back to the function, which was addressed with the introduction of the statement at the end of the part, where Z is the final value to be returned. =Other changes= CAL included the mathematical functions of JOSS but added a number of new ones including , , , and . It added a new operator as well, , which returned the remainder of a division of its two operands. =Direct mode= CAL added a small number of direct mode commands and associated statements. , when encountered in a program, printed a message \\"PAUSED AT STEP 1.1\\" and then returned to direct mode. This was similar to the command in BASIC. This allowed the user to type in values and the continue execution with . While in direct mode, the user could by a single line at a time to trace the execution of the program. CAL changed JOSS' user- defined function to the somewhat more obvious , while also changing the parameter list to use [] instead of (). In JOSS these were normally found in direct mode, whereas in CAL they were only allowed in direct mode. For instance, one could . This example also demonstrates JOSS' ability to use a loop range as the input to a function. In contrast to JOSS, CAL allowed multi- step functions by adding additional statements separated by a colon, for instance, . Note that this example has no body, it simply calls c =Improvements in CAL 1969= One minor change in the 1969 version was the elimination of the command for variable assignment. This had been optional in direct mode in JOSS but was required in program statements, and the 1967 version of CAL had followed this rule. The 1969 version made it optional in both cases.

Life, Death and Legacy Born in Washington, New Jersey, in 1810, Christian Sharps married Sarah Elizabeth Chadwick of Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania. The couple had two children: a daughter, Satella, and a son, Leon Stewart. Sharps was hired as an apprentice gunsmith at the Harpers Ferry Arsenal in the 1830s. While at Harpers Ferry, he was introduced to the Hall rifle, an early breech-loader, and worked for its inventor, Captain John H. Hall. Sharps also became versed in the manufacture of weapons with fully interchangeable parts. Sharps Model 1852 \\"Slanting Breech\\" Carbine, open for loading, two primer-tapes Sharps' first rifle was patented September 12, 1848, a breech loading design it featured \\"slanting breech action\\" and used paper cartridges.IMPROVEMENT IN BREECH-LOADING FIRE- ARMS retrieved 20 September 2008 from Google. It was manufactured by \\"A. S. Nippes\\" at Mill Creek, (Philadelphia) Pennsylvania, in 1850. In 1851, Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company (later renamed \\"Sharps Rifle Co\\") was organized as a holding company with $1,000 in capital and with John C. Palmer as president, Christian Sharps as engineer, and Richard S. Lawrence as master armorer and superintendent of manufacturing. Sharps was to be paid a royalty of $1 per firearm and the factory was built on R&L;'s property in Hartford, Connecticut. Christian Sharps left the company in 1855 to form his own manufacturing company called \\"C. Sharps & Co.\\" which produced four-barrel derringers, and later renamed \\"Sharps & Hankins\\", in partnership with William Hankins, in 1862. Both firms were located in Philadelphia. Sharps & Hankins not only produced four-barrel derringers, but also the single-shot Model 1861 Navy Rifles and the Model 1862 Carbines, both of which featured forward \\"sliding breech actions\\" and fired the .56-52 Spencer rimfire metallic cartridge. The Sharps and Hankins partnership ended in 1867, and Sharps resumed the manufacturing of firearms under the C. Sharps and Co. name. In 1870, Sharps and his family moved to Vernon, Connecticut, where he continued working on firearm designs and started a large trout farming business. Succumbing to tuberculosis, Sharps died in Vernon, on March 12, 1874. In all, he was awarded a total of fifteen firearms-related patents. \\"C. Sharps & Co.\\" was shuttered after his death and firearms production came to an end. Although, \\"Sharps Rifle Co\\" continued to produce his namesake rifles until 1881, when it too closed its doors. In 1983, Shiloh Rifle Manufacturing Company began to produce a line of modern reproductions of the legendary 1874 Sharps Rifle, featured in the 1990 Western film Quigley Down Under, starring Tom Selleck.Sharp, Eric. - \\"Shooting Star - Antique Black-Powder Rifle Still Scene-Stealer\\". - Detroit Free Press. - June 18, 2006.Names and Faces: \\"On Target\\". - Orlando Sentinel. - August 6, 1989. Previously, the Sharps rifle reproductions were manufactured by \\"Shiloh Products Inc.\\" founded by Len Mul√© (pronounce Mull-A) in partnership with Wolfgang Droge. Len Mul√© is considered the second founder of Sharps and responsible for its re-introduction into the modern era. The Sharps Rifle Model 1849 Berdan Sharps rifle Sharps was issued a patent for his design of a breech-loading rifle on September 12, 1848. The deficiencies of the Hall rifle may have caused Sharps to adopt his new design. The Sharps rifle was designed with a vertical dropping block action, operated by a lever which also served as a trigger guard. The action was not only strong but limited the release of gases when the gun was discharged. Sharps' first rifle, the Model 1849, was manufactured by A.S. Nippes & Co. at Mill Creek, Lower Merion Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Despite not being the first breech-loading rifle, Sharps' was the first to be accepted widely and, with the onset of the American Civil War, the first to be produced in large quantities. The Sharps, in a carbine version, was the most widely used cavalry carbine by the Union Army. It was so successful that it was copied and manufactured by the Confederate government to arm its mounted troops. Sharps- designed firearms later saw extensive use in the American West as military and hunting weapons. They were highly regarded as target rifles and were used extensively in international shooting competitions through the late 19th century. The Sharps Derringer Sharps four-barrel .22 Rimfire derringer One of the more common derringers found in the \\"Old West\\" were the Sharps Derringers. They are four-barrel, single-action derringers with a revolving firing pin. They come in .22, .30 and .32 rimfire, and their four barrels slide forward to load and unload. First patented in 1849, they were not made until 1859, when Sharps patented a practical derringer design. These first model derringers had brass frames and fired the recently introduced .22 Rimfire metallic cartridges. The second model was a .30 Rimfire derringer. These pistols were made by \\"C. Sharps and Co\\", and are sometimes classified by modern collectors as a pepperbox.Guns of the Old West In 1862 William Hankins partnered with Sharps, bringing much needed funding and the company was renamed \\"Sharps & Hankins\\". They introduced the third model derringer in .32 Rimfire, with an iron frame, and the barrel release was moved from under the frame to the left side of the frame. These were discontinued when the partnership ended in 1867. In the same year, the newly renamed \\"C. Sharps and Co\\" introduced the fourth model derringer with a new \\"birdshead\\" grip and slightly shorter barrels, otherwise it was virtually identical to the third model. Production of these little pistols came to an end with the death of Christian Sharps in 1874. Approximately 100,000 of these derringers were made between 1859 and 1874.

Brown admitted in a July 2000 interview that after the Columbine High School massacre she no longer felt comfortable performing \\"Homecoming Queen\\", even though the circumstances of the song were quite different from the real-life events, and it had been comic at the time of its debut. \\"I can be very sensitive about whether I am doing something that will hurt people,\\" Brown said. \\"So you are always drawing the comedy line of what you will or won't do.\\" In October 2008, Brown released a re-written version, \\"The Ex-Beauty Queen's Got a Gun,\\" parodying Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin during Palin's bid for election with John McCain.

United States, 249 U.S. 211 (1919), was a United States Supreme Court decision, relevant for US labor law and constitutional law, that upheld the Espionage Act of 1917. Facts Eugene V. Debs was an American labor and political leader and five-time Socialist Party of America candidate for the American Presidency. On June 16, 1918 Debs made an anti-war speech in Canton, Ohio, protesting US involvement in World War I. He was arrested under the Espionage Act of 1917 and convicted, sentenced to serve ten years in prison and to be disenfranchised for life. The case against Debs was based on a document entitled Anti-War Proclamation and Program, showing that Debs' original intent was to openly protest against the war. The argument of the Federal Government was that Debs was attempting to arouse mutiny and treason by preventing the drafting of soldiers into the United States Army. This type of speech was outlawed in the United States with the Espionage Act of June 15, 1917. The defense argued that Debs was entitled to the rights of free speech provided for in the first amendment of the Bill of Rights. This was one of three cases decided in 1919 in which the Court had upheld convictions that restricted free speech. Judgement In its ruling on Debs v. United States, the Court examined several statements that Debs had made regarding the war. While he had tempered his speeches in an attempt to comply with the Espionage Act, the Court found he had shown the \\"intention and effect of obstructing the draft and recruitment for the war.\\" Among other things, the Court cited Debs' praise for those imprisoned for obstructing the draft. In his opinion, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. stated that Debs' case was essentially the same as Schenck v. United States (1919), in which the Court upheld a similar conviction. The Supreme Court decided against Debs, and maintained the power of the Espionage Act. Debs' sentence to ten years imprisonment and loss of citizenship was upheld. Holmes J said the following: Significance Debs went to prison on April 13, 1919. While in federal prison, he was nominated for president by the Socialist Party of America in the 1920 Election for the fifth and final time despite his disfranchisement. He received 919,799 votes (3.4% of the popular vote), the most ever for a Socialist Party presidential candidate in the U.S. It was slightly more than his 900,672 total in the 1912 election, which had equaled six percent of the popular vote. (National women's suffrage in 1920 greatly increased the total number of votes cast.) In 1921, Congress largely repealed the Espionage and Sedition Acts. On December 23, 1921 President Warren G. Harding commuted Debs' sentence to time served, effective Christmas Day. He did not issue a pardon. The two met the following day at the White House.

In the wake of the incident, galvanized by public outrage, President Alberto Fujimori intensified his crackdown on Peruvian insurgent groups.  Background  In 1992, Peru was in the midst of terrorists groups, the most radical and active of which was Shining Path, a militant offshoot of the Peruvian Communist Party. That year, a coup led by President Alberto Fujimori on April 5, in which he dissolved Congress as part of a broader political crackdown, aggravated the domestic social conflict.El Atentado de Tarata (Spanish) Earlier Shining Path attacks that year included the February 15 murder of Mar√≠a Elena Moyano, a community organizer in Villa El Salvador Ward, who was shot at close range then blown up with dynamite. Also, on June 5 a car bomb exploded beside the Frecuencia Latina television station near midnight, killing journalist Alejandro Perez one of the survivors was Magali Veran.  The attack  The attack took place on Thursday July 16 and targeted the Credit Bank of Peru located on Avenida Larco. During the day, Shining Path forces in Lima conducted attacks against police stations and smaller financial institutions in order to disperse the police and clear the way for the main attack. Near the planned time, there was a wavering in electric power followed by one of the blackouts common in the city at that time. According to testimony of Shining Path militants interviewed by the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the twelfth Shining Path detachment in Lima, commanded by \\"Comrade Daniel\\" (later identified as Carlos Mora La Madrid in the Commission's records), was responsible for conducting the attack. The original plan was to set off explosives in front of that bank at 9:20 pm, but the establishment did not allow them to park in the place agreed. They therefore decided to leave their vehicle at the next intersection (which was Tarata Street) and allow it to drift forward until it exploded. Once in the street, the driver slowed down and abandoned the truck. The explosive payload was 400‚Äî500 kilograms of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil mixed with dynamite. The buildings most affected by their locations near the center of the blast were El Condado, San Pedro, Tarata, Central Residential and San Carlos. The shock wave extended for 300 meters. The explosion killed 25, wounded 155, and caused more than US$3 million in damage.  Impact  Response from around the world denounced the Shining Path and expressed support with the Peruvian government and people in overcoming the situation. According to specialists, it was the first time in the course of the civil war that \\"traditional\\" Lima society experienced the conflict. It was the first time that a terrorist act was carried out against a large-scale civilian target and the first direct attack on a city center. The attack also led to self-examinations within the Shining Path, whose main leaders recognized the act as a \\"mistake\\" that should not have happened because it did not advance the group's main objective. This attack was used as a justification for the La Cantuta massacre two days later on July 18, in which nine students and one teacher at the National University of Education Enrique Guzm√°n y Valle, Shining Path suspects, were kidnapped and disappeared during the night by members of the Grupo Colina death squad. All were accused of having perpetrated the Tarata bombing. Shining Path leader Abimael Guzm√°n was arrested in September 1992 and sentenced to life imprisonment. In 2014 he and his wife Elena Iparraguirre were tried for having ordered the Tarata bombing.

North was born in Berlin, Connecticut, into a prosperous family able to provide all six sons with farms of their own. North was given a farm in Berlin, a gift that enabled him to marry Lucy Savage when he was only twenty-one years old; the couple would have five sons and three daughters. In 1795 the Norths purchased a sawmill located on the brook that ran beside their land. Simeon hired a man to help run it, enlarged the building to house a forge and trip-hammer, and began manufacturing scythes from imported steel. Four years later, he obtained a contract to make pistols and began to add a factory to the mill building. Simeon North naval pistol with ramrod, 1808 North's brother-in-law Elisha Cheney was skilled clockmaker, a trade he had learned from his father Benjamin and uncle Timothy Cheney, two of the finest clockmakers in Connecticut. In 1810, Elisha Cheney moved his clock-making shop to the next waterpower site upstream from North. Although Cheney was trained as a maker of fine clocks in brass and other materials, Eli Terry, a clockmaker who had trained as a clockmaker with either Timothy or Benjamin Cheney, had just invented a method of producing the parts for wooden shelf, or pillar-and-scroll clocks that enabled them to be mass-produced using interchangeable parts. Cheney used his new plant to mass-produce parts that manufacturers were turning out in emulation of Eli Terry's innovation. Cheney is known to have also produced screws and small metal parts in his mill for the pistols his brother-in-law was manufacturing just downstream. North is now generally credited with the invention of the milling machine, the first entirely new type of machine invented in America and one which, by replacing filing, made the production of interchangeable parts practicable. By 1813, North had signed a government contract to produce 20,000 pistols that specified that parts of the lock had to be completely interchangeable between any of the 20,000 locks: the first contract of which any such evidence exists. It was during this period that North is believed to have invented a milling machine, which was able to shape metal mechanically and thus replaced filing by hand. Historian Diana Muir believes that he accomplished this around 1816. According to Muir's book Reflections in Bullough's Pond, North \\"was the first arms maker to implement a number of machine production techniques, yet he cautiously halted his pursuit of mass-produced, interchangeable parts\\" whenever it became apparent that it was uneconomic. For some time, interchangeable-part manufacturing in metal would continue to be a combination of machine-made parts and human skill in filing machined parts to precise size for such high-end uses as military weapons, in which interchangeable parts were worth paying for at high prices (they were worth high prices because an army on campaign could cannibalize damaged weapons for parts). As North's business grew, he moved it from Berlin to nearby Middletown. At about that time, North was sent to Captain John H. Hall, superintendent of the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now in West Virginia), to introduce his methods of achieving interchangeability. In 1828, North received a contract to produce 5,000 Hall rifles with parts interchangeable with those produced at Harpers Ferry. North had a 53-year contractual relationship with the United States Department of War. The report of Charles H. Fitch prepared for the 1880 Census, pp. 4,5,26. credits North with a key role in developing manufacture with interchangeable parts.

In 1784, Buell published A New and correct Map of the United States of North America Layd down from the latest Observations and best Authorities agreeable to the Peace of 1783; it was the first map of the new United States created by an American. He was also an inventor. He invented a lapidary machine to cut and polish gems, a minting machine that could product 120 coins per minute, and machines for planting onions and corn. He was the first man to design and cast type in the United States. Early life As a child, Abel Buell apprenticed with a goldsmith. By age 19, he was financially secure and married his girlfriend. In 1755, Buell was apprenticed, Madison, Connecticut to master silversmith and his future brother-in-law, Ebenezer Chittenden. Chittenden has the distinction of having produced more individual, surviving silver pieces, than any other silversmith in Connecticut. Career Buell gained notoriety at an early age as a counterfeiter by altering five-pound note engraving plates into larger denomination plates. His sentence was to be branded above the forehead under the scalp, loss of a portion of his right ear, and life in prison, plus forfeiture of all his lands and estates. Because of his youth, he served little time in prison and only the top part of his ear was cut off, but the authorities permitted it to be sewn back on. In 1765, Buell received a patent for a lapidary machine, making him the first Connecticut resident to receive a patent. After creating a ring on that machine, and presenting it to the prosecuting attorney, Buell's counterfeiting sentence was pardoned. In 1770, Buell moved to New Haven, Connecticut and went to work for cartographer Bernard Romans. After the American Revolutionary War ended, Buell used the minting machine he had invented to mint the State of Connecticut's first official copper coins. Connecticut coppers were struck from 1785 to 1788 by Buell. Buell engraved the dies for the Connecticut copper coinage as well as the dies for the Fugio cents - America's first coinage. By 1784, Buell cast his own typeset and published the first American-made map of the United States. The wall map measured 43 √ó 48 inches, was printed in four sections, and hand-applied watercolor gave the map its color. In 1789, Buell went to England on behalf of a group of investors to steal the secrets of cotton manufacturing from the British and bring that knowledge back to America. While there, he gained both practical knowledge and a sum of money that allowed him, upon his return, to establish one of Connecticut's first cotton mills. In later life, Buell joined with David Greenleaf to fashion some of the first steel swords manufactures specifically for the U.S. government. These swords were later used in the War of 1812 and were in service through the U.S. Civil War. Death Squandering or giving away all the money he earned, Buell died in 1822 at the New Haven Almshouse. Leaving little behind, he is known mostly because of the biography researched and written by Dr. Lawrence C. Wroth and a new biography by Christopher McDowell. However, the U.S. Library of Congress received a donation of this rare map, and on November 11, 2013 it mounted an exhibition displaying it both in the Thomas Jefferson Building, and on an online version.

Since the cartridge it was replacing was the .45-70 Government, the round was considered small-bore at the time. The design selected was ultimately the Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen, formally adopted as the M1892 Springfield. It was also used in M1893 and later Gatling guns. History and development Though the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps had adopted limited numbers of smokeless powder and bolt-action rifles, the .30-40 was the first cartridge adopted by the US Army that was designed from the outset for smokeless powder. After a brief experiment with a 230-grain bullet loading, the .30 Army loading was standardized in 1894 using a metal-jacketed round- nose bullet with of nitrocellulose powder. This loading developed a maximum velocity of in the barrel of the Krag rifle, and in the barrel of the Krag carbine. The rimmed .30-40 round was also known as .30 Army, or .30 U.S. Although the .30-40 Krag was the first smokeless powder round adopted by the U.S. military, it retained the \\"caliber-charge\\" naming system of earlier black powder cartridges, i.e. a .30-caliber bullet propelled by of smokeless powder. The first use of a smokeless powder round by Winchester was a single shot in 30-40, and it was one of only three rounds for which the 1895 Winchester lever action, introduced in 1896, was originally chambered.History of Winchester Firearms, 1866-1992, Thomas Henshaw, p 44-45 From the outset, the .30-40 cartridge proved popular for hunting, and was chambered in a variety of firearms. In 1899, a Krag in .30-40 caliber was used to shoot the world-record Rocky Mountain elk. The record stood until the latter half of the 20th century. In October 1899, after reviewing the experiences of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, U.S. Army ordnance authorities developed a new loading for the .30 Army used in the Krag rifle, in an attempt to match the ballistics of the 7√ó57mm Mauser cartridge employed by Spanish forces in that conflict. The new loading increased the muzzle velocity in the rifle version of the Krag to at 45,000 psi. However, once the new loading was issued, reports of cracked locking lugs on service Krags began to surface. In March 1900 the remaining stocks of this ammunition (some 3.5 million rounds) were returned to the arsenals, broken down, and reloaded back to the original specification. In 1903, after recommendations from the infantry Small Arms Board, the U.S. Army formally adopted a higher-velocity .30-caliber replacement for the .30-40 or .30 Army cartridge.

It includes 22 described genera and at least 83 species. Members of this family can be distinguished from members of other families by the absence of claws on tarsi of leg I, tarsal segmentation 1-2-2-(2-4), pedipalps with pairs of lateroventral spines, and by males having an immovable flagellum on the mesal face of each chelicerum. The propeltidium of the Ammotrechidae is recurved. The common names used for Ammotrechidae are curve- faced solifugids and sand runners. They live in arid regions, such as dune and rocky habitats. They are carnivores which feed mainly on other invertebrates. Ammotrechidae have relatively high metabolic rates, which allow them to be voracious predators. They feed by masticating their prey and sucking out the liquids. They are preyed upon by other vertebrates. Species of Ammotrechidae are found to be cannibalistic. Males and females dig shallow burrows for protection and nesting. The species in North America are found in the South to Southwest and are rarely longer than 2 inches. Though they can be pests, they are considered beneficial because they feed on scorpions, spiders, and termites.

Remington Mason began his career as an apprentice patternmaker, eventually working in the arms industry for Remington Arms. While at Remington, on November 21 1865, he received U.S. patent 51,117, for a swing- out cylinder for easy loading and the star ejector mechanism to eject spent cartridge cases, a design used in 1896 by S&W; for the .38 Hand Ejector (M&P; and S&W; Model 10). Colt Mason left Remington Arms in 1866 to work for Colt as the Superintendent of the armory. Along with Charles Richards, Mason patented designs to convert percussion revolvers into rear-loading metallic cartridge revolvers. Those converted revolvers are identified as the \\"Richards-Mason conversion\\". After working on these conversions, Mason began work on Colt's first metallic cartridge revolvers in 1871: the Colt Model 1871-72 ‚ÄúOpen Top‚Äù revolver was the third such pistol, following the .41 caliber House Pistol and the .22 caliber seven-shot Open Top. The Open Top .44 was a completely new design and the parts would not interchange with the older percussion pistols. Mason moved the rear sight to the rear of the barrel as opposed to the hammer or the breechblock of the earlier efforts. The caliber was .44 Henry and it was submitted to the US Army for testing in 1872. The Army rejected the pistol and asked for a more powerful caliber with a stronger frame. Mason redesigned the frame to incorporate a top strap, similar to the Remington revolvers and placed the rear sight on the rear of the frame. The first prototype was chambered in .44 rimfire, but the first model was in the newest caliber known as the .45 Colt. Colt Navy Model 1861 Richards Mason Conversion .38 cal The revolver was chosen by the Army in 1872, with the first order shipping in the summer of 1873 for 8,000 revolvers. After the success of the Colt Single Action Army and Colt's conversion of existing percussion revolvers to Richards-Mason conversions, Mason went on to design Colt's smallest revolver, \\"The New Line\\" in 1874. There were 5 variants, each differing in size and caliber, but all using a breechblock designed by Mason. While Colt had first developed the concept of a \\"double-action\\" revolver as early as 1857 and a patent was filed, it was never built by Colt. With increased competition from their British rival, Webley & Scott, Colt had Mason design a double-action revolver for them in 1877, the Colt M1877. Following this, Mason once again teamed up with Richards to produce a larger framed version, the Colt M1878 Frontier in 1878. His final design for Colt was the Colt M1889, a collaboration with Carl J. Ehbets for a revolver with a swing- out cylinder. Ehbets continued to perfect the idea for 7 years after Mason left Colt for Winchester. Winchester Mason left Colt to work for the Winchester Repeating Arms Company in 1882. While he was originally hired to design a revolver to compete with Colt's revolvers, Mason eventually made working prototypes of many of John Moses Browning's designs. One of his more notable design improvements was the Winchester Model 1886 rifle. In 1885 he became the Master Mechanic at Winchester and held that position until his death in Worcester, Massachusetts on July 17, 1913. Mason was an inaugural member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and over the course of his life he patented 125 inventions for firearms, ammunition, firearm manufacturing machinery, steam pumps and power looms.

It is located approximately from the Brisbane CBD. It was named after the early Australian explorer John Oxley. The suburb supports a mix of residential, retail and industrial land. Geography Jacaranda tree in Mabel Street, 2004 Oxley is bounded to the north by the Brisbane River and Oxley Creek flows along the eastern edge. In the east the environment is shaped by flood plains which experience major flooding and flash-flooding. Western parts of the suburb are characterised by rolling hills with clay-laden soils. left The suburb is traversed by the Ipswich Motorway connecting Oxley to Rocklea to the east and Darra to the west. Oxley Road connects Oxley to Corinda to the north and continues south across the Ipswich Motorway with the name Blunder Road to Durack, Seventeen Mile Rocks Road connects Oxley to the west to Seventeen Mile Rocks and Darra. Oxley is separated from Fig Tree Pocket by the Brisbane River. Oxley resides in the same postal code area as Corinda, Sherwood and Graceville. left Oxley has two golf courses and a golf driving range‚ÄîOxley Golf Course located on Boundary Road, and Corinda Golf Course located on Cliveden Avenue, the latter of which has now been purchased by Brisbane Boys' College as their playing fields along with the driving range. Oxley also contains a lawn bowls club, the Canossa Private Hospital, the Queensland Police Service's training academy, two highway motels, a war memorial, post office, mosque and a few churches. Stores include an Aldi supermarket, a smaller Foodworks grocery store and a McDonald's restaurant. Retailers with outlets in Oxley include Harvey Norman, Bunnings Warehouse, Officeworks, Super A-mart, The Good Guys and there is a 1st Choice liquor store. The suburb has two petrol service stations and a few landscaping material suppliers in the western parts. With an easily accessed supply of clay in the area PGH Bricks & Pavers has one of two Queensland production plants located here. On 17 July 2013, a new Woolworths store opened on Oxley Station Road. The Station Oxley Shopping Centre is located at 133 Station Road also contains approximately 15 speciality retail stores and the Department of Disability Services Queensland on the upper level. The former Austral Bricks quarry site in Douglas Street, as well as two other plots of vacant land in the area have been converted to residential estates, providing significant housing to a region and growing city, where strong demand is not being met by supply. The quarry was originally owned by Brittain Bricks. For many years the site was a brickworks, sourcing clay directly from adjacent pits. After production stopped, the kiln stack remained intact. During the mid-1990s the tall structure was removed as it was attracting lightning strikes. History =19th century= The first land sale that covered parts of today's Oxley occurred in 1851. Oxley once covered a larger area including the suburbs of Chelmer, Graceville and Corinda to the north. It extended to the south into the current suburbs of Willawong and Durack. The first subdivision of residential lands occurred in 1864 near Douglas Street. Although the railway through the suburb connected Oxley to the rest of Brisbane it was the road to Ipswich that defined the suburb's early development. The suburb was a stop- over point on the Cobb & Co coach route west to the Darling Downs. The first hotel in Oxley was built in 1860 close to Oxley Creek on a rise near Factory Road. It attracted other businesses to the area and provided refreshments for travellers between Brisbane and Ipswich. The hotel soon gained a reputation as a venue where drinking and dancing occurred well into the morning hours. The hotel was moved several times due to flooding which was not a deterrent to the licensee. By 1892 a brick hotel has been built on the corner of Oxley Road and Ipswich Road, the site of a public bar still open today. In 1870 the first school in Oxley was opened. A small creamery was operating in 1873, most probably located near Factory Road in Oxley's south east parts. The railway station was opened in 1874. This led to the establishment of a second subdivision in 1876, referred to as the Township of Oxley which was centred on the train station. It consisted of 140 allotments with the lower ones experiencing periodic inundation. In the same year the construction of the first police station was completed. Dairying became common in the area during the 1890s. The 1893 Brisbane flood halted housing construction in the lower parts of Oxley for many years. William Brittain moved his brick making operations to a site on Douglas Street in 1899. In 1879, the local government area of Yeerongpilly Division was created. In 1891, parts of Yeerongpilly Division were excised to create Sherwood Division becoming a Shire in 1903 which contained the suburb of Oxley. In 1925, the Shire of Sherwood was amalgamated into the City of Brisbane. =20th century= James Mitchell's residence, 1906 Motor vehicles in the bush, 1930 By 1904 the \\"Bacon Factory\\" as it was locally known as, which produced not only bacon but also cheese, ham and other small goods was established. Because of regular flooding the Oxley police station was moved in 1911, to a site where the police academy currently is. The Oxley Progress Association was founded in 1917. It built the small hall in Station Road and supported the establishment of the Oxley War Memorial. This community group was still active in the early 1990s. During this time the Darra cement works on the western edge of Oxley had plans for a major expansion. With the help of the Oxley Progress Association residents were successful in stopping this development. In the 1960s the group played a major role in the proclamation of Queensland's Clean Air Act. The Oxley war memorial to the fallen was opened in 1920. The Oxley Golf Club was established in 1928. A Methodist church was built in 1930 and a Presbyterian church in 1961. The Oxley Scout Group was formed in 1951 and in 1955 the Oxley fire station was established. An ambulance station was built in the suburb in 1961 but was moved to Durack in 2002. Oxley High School was opened in 1966 and then closed in 2000. The bus/rail interchange at Oxley station was built in 1977. =21st century= 2011 Queensland flood peak In 2003, Oxley was one of a number of suburbs that benefited from the Suburban Community Improvement Programme. Landscaping and tree planting around Oxley Station and the beautification of the nearby roundabout and footpaths were some of the activities undertaken by the Brisbane City Council to improve the area's appearance. A second tavern on Blunder Road was opened in 2003. The 2010‚Äì2011 Queensland floods inundated many properties along the main roads of Oxley Road, Blunder Road and the Ipswich Motorway as well as at least ten minor roads.  Heritage listings  Oxley War Memorial, 2014 Oxley has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 1218 Oxley Road: Oxley War Memorial Transport Oxley railway station, 2009 The Ipswich Motorway traverses Oxley and the train from Brisbane to Ipswich has a station at Oxley, and is connected to a number of suburbs via bus services. A CityExpress bus stop on Blunder Road links Inala Plaza bus station to the inner city using Ipswich Road. Oxley Road connects the Ipswich Motorway to the suburb of Indooroopilly via the Walter Taylor Bridge. Demographics In the 2011 census the population of Oxley was 7,291, 51.1% female and 48.9% male. The median age of the Oxley population was 34 years of age, 3 years below the Australian median. 64.4% of people living in Oxley were born in Australia, slightly below the national average of 69.8%. The other top responses for country of birth were Vietnam 4.3%, England 3.7%, New Zealand 3.3%, Philippines 1.4%, India 1.2%. 72.1% of people spoke only English at home, the next most popular languages were 6.1% Vietnamese, 1% Hindi, 1% Arabic, 1% Mandarin, 0.8% Cantonese  Community groups  The Oxley branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association meets at the QCWA Oxley Hall at 76 Lincoln Street.

In 1856, at the age of 21, he worked at the Colt armory in Hartford, Connecticut as a die sinker and tool maker and became their expert on the drop forging process. In 1862, he went to E. Remington & Sons, where he built up their forging plant, increasing its efficiency and saving $50,000 by one improvement in frame forging alone. At the end of the American Civil War, he returned to Hartford as the superintendent of the Weed Sewing Machine Company, which had taken over the old Sharps Rifle Works, built by Robbins & Lawrence. In 1868, while at the Roper Repeating Arms Company in Amherst, Massachusetts, he worked with Christopher M. Spencer. The Roper company failed and in 1869, the two founded a partnership in Hartford, Connecticut called Billings & Spencer, which would manufacture sewing machines, drop-forged hand tools, and machine tools. Billings perfected a drop hammer for metal forging in the 1870s and designed the copper commutator which was central to the operation of electrical generators and motors. In 1895, Billings was president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. He died on June 5, 1920 in Hartford, Connecticut and was interred at Cedar Hill Cemetery.

He founded and runs Little Mountain Recordings and THIS IS Recordings. Kleinenberg is well known for his use of digital video in concerts, his \\"Everybody\\" and This Is brands of club nights and albums and his 2000 single \\"My Lexicon\\" as well as hits like \\"The Fruit\\" and \\"This Is Miami\\". Music career Sander Kleinenberg began DJing at a local bar in 1987 at the age of 15, playing a variety of music including rock and dance music. After sending demos to many European record labels, Kleinenberg released his first single \\"Bombay\\" in 1993 on Belgian record label Wonka Beats under the artist name Free Frogs, a collaboration with several friends. The next year, he released a single on German record label Superstition. In 1996, Kleinenberg released \\"YDW (You Do Me Wrong)\\" under the moniker S 'N' S on the Dutch record label Deal Records and licensed by Strictly Rhythm. His early influences included Mantronix, Shep Pettibone, and Depeche Mode. In 1999, Kleinenberg produced the first part of his thematic 4 Seasons trilogy with second part the following in 2000, both on London's FFRR label. Kleinenberg was also becoming known worldwide with the release of his track \\"My Lexicon\\", which is now often considered a genre standard of progressive house. \\"My Lexicon\\" is well known for its catchy, trancey percussive melody and atmospheric chord stabs. \\"My Lexicon\\" and \\"Sacred\\" were both given a boost in popularity by their appearance on Sasha's Global Underground 013: Ibiza album. Kleinenberg was to join the Global Underground label the following year with his Nubreed 004 release. In 2003, Sander Kleinenberg founded his record label Little Mountain Recordings. Its first release was the final part in Kleinenberg's 4 Seasons series, which had been pushed back due to, among other things, label changes. Kleinenberg described the final installment as \\"rougher around the edges\\" rather than having the trancey serenity of the first or the funkiness of the second. He also remixed Justin Timberlake's single \\"Rock Your Body\\", which garnered him the Best Remix award at the Dancestar USA Awards. Later in 2003, Kleinenberg kicked off the introduction of his \\"Everybody\\" brand with the album Renaissance: Everybody which featured a mixture of quirky disco, Detroit techno, and tech house. Kleinenberg described the concept of \\"Everybody\\" as \\"a reaction to how dance music began to take itself too seriously\\" and that he hopes to show that dance music can be fun. He followed Everybody up the next year with a sequel, This Is Everybody Too, which continued Kleinenberg's vein of \\"glitchy, low key techno\\". In 2005, Kleinenberg began a monthly residency at Crobar, New York City, using it to push the \\"Everybody\\" brand. He also brought in Lee Burridge to Crobar and to work on the album This is Everybody! On Tour. Kleinenberg's performances at Crobar often featured appearances from young DJs, such as Desyn Masiello. Over his career, Kleinenberg's track selection shifted from the more \\"lush\\" sounds of progressive house to a funkier electro house vibe, though he prefers to define his genre simply as \\"house music\\". In 2004 he had released his track \\"The Fruit\\" and in 2006 he released \\"This is Miami\\"; both tracks reached a number one position in the ARIA chart. His \\"Everybody\\" brand has grown with the years and has changed to his current \\"This Is...\\" brand which was influenced by his song \\"This Is Miami\\", another version of the song which was used in the Sensation (event) is called, \\"This Is Sensation\\". The This Is club brand held residencies in clubs like Avalon in Los Angeles, Discoteque in Moscow, Paradiso and Melkweg in Amsterdam, Red Light in Paris and Pacha in Ibiza After years of intensive touring Sander Kleinenberg got back into the studio to deliver his debut album '5K' in 2010. The first single of this album was \\"Remember When\\", featuring UK singer/songwriter Jamie Cullum. Together with the release of the \\"5K\\" album and the \\"Remember When\\" single, Sander launched his new music label THIS IS Recordings. In early 2012, Kleinenberg toured Lahore, Pakistan and performed in front of a large audience.Ministry of Sound: Dancing in the afternoon, Express Tribune On December 1, 2014, he released his single \\"Can You Feel It\\" featuring Gwen McCrae. The single has been described as \\"a deep and soulful intervention in the Dutch maestro‚Äôs indie dance etiquette, held together with strong production values and an inherently intimate demeanor.\\" Visuals and DVJing Sander Kleinenberg is well known for his DVJing with self-created visuals and video usage in concerts. Kleinenberg explains his use of video saying that it allows for more variety among DJs and performances and that it makes concerts reflect life. Due to the complexity of mixing both audio and visual at concerts, Kleinenberg will use the club's on-site VJ or have his partner Mark Pistoire of Venga Boys fame as a VJ at his concerts using the DVJ-X1 or the newer DVJ1000. Kleinenberg first met Pistoire in 2003 when searching for a VJ for his \\"Everybody\\" events and the two performed live together for the first time in The Hague. The in-concert imagery often includes political content or trippy home videos created by Pistoire or Kleinenberg.

Bullard Mult-Au-Matic, a vertical, multispindle automatic lathe, 1914., p. 276 ff. Memorial Day 1942 at Bullard The Bullard Machine Tool Company was a large American machine tool builder. It specialized in vertical boring mills and was largely responsible for the development of the modern form of that class of machine tools., pp. 183-185 The firm was founded in 1894 by Edward Payson Bullard Sr. (born 1841-04-18 in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, USA; died 1906-12-22 in Bridgeport, Connecticut, USA, pp. 113-114). He received formative experience at the Colt armory and Pratt & Whitney, which were influential development centers for generations of toolmakers., p. 174 Bullard Sr is believed to have developed the first small boring machine designed to do the accurate work previously performed on the faceplate of a lathe., p. 184 Roe (1916) says that \\"Up to that time boring machines were relied on only for large and rough work.\\" Bullard Sr.'s son, Edward Payson Bullard Jr. (1872‚Äì1953), continued the family machine tool business and brought the turret principle to the vertical boring mill, making it a vertical turret lathe. For a while in America during the 20th century, the name \\"Bullard\\" on the shop floor was something of a genericized trademark for vertical turret-head boring mills.. E.P. Bullard Jr led the development of the company's multiple-spindle brand machine that became an important automatic lathe in the mass production of parts for the automotive industry. Bullard Jr was president of the company for 40 years, through World War I, the interwar period, and World War II, a period during which the Bullard company was the largest machine tool builder in the U.S., and vast volumes of military mat√©riel were produced by countless companies running Bullard machines.

Traditional belief established that this vein ran directly from the fourth finger of the left hand to the heart. This theory has been cited in Western cultures as one of the reasons the engagement ring and/or wedding ring was placed on the fourth finger, or \\"ring finger\\". The earliest use of jewelry to signify a bonding was often chains and bracelets. This evolved to the use of the symbolic ring. In ancient Egypt, the Sun and the Moon gods were feared and worshipped. A ring was a symbol of these spirits, both of whom were also related to the home and hearth. The endless circle showed the eternal nature of the bond, while the open centre was meant to be a doorway to things unknown. This tradition was later assimilated by the Greeks, after Alexander the Great conquered Egypt in 332 BC. Up to this time betrothal rings were generally made out of hemp, leather, bone, or ivory. In early Rome the use of metal rings gradually began to take over from these materials, and the metal of choice back then was iron. Gold and silver rings were given on rare occasions, to prove that a man trusted his wife with his valuable property. The earliest known occurrence of the phrase vena amoris was from Henry Swinburne, an English ecclesiastical lawyer whose work covering marriage, the puritanical \\"A Treatise of Espousal or Matrimonial Contracts\\", was published posthumously in 1686. He cites unidentified ancient sources and purports an Egyptian connection; but no earlier mention of the vein can be found. Macrobius, in Saturnalia VII, 13 (a notably fictional work) refers to the connection between the ring finger and the heart, but implies in the one phrase a nerve rather than a vein, and in another implies more of a magical than physical significance to the choice of finger. The hand is not specified. Of note, the circulatory system was unknown at the time. Another early reference, again not specifying the hand, was by Isidore of Seville in his 7th century work De ecclesiasticis officiis XX, 8, which refers to the Roman story of a vein connected to the heart. The choice of finger is also less than settled until recent times; during the 17th century in England it was not unusual to wear the wedding ring on the thumb. Gauls and Britons wore their rings on the middle finger,Pliny Natural History XXXIII, 6 and the choice of right or left hand appears relatively dependent on culture; though cultures that use either the right or left ring finger both claim a historical connection to the vena amoris. The use of wedding and betrothal rings was not commonplace in the Roman Empire until the 2nd century; which also contradicts versions of the story which claim that this tradition was brought to Rome in the 3rd century BC. The strong possibility exists, based on the lack of concrete sources, that this story is a combination of ancient beliefs in the mystical properties of the ring finger, smatterings of legend, and shrewd marketing by the jewellery industry, which has in the past demonstrated a willingness to exploit myths and legends to increase ring sales.Howard, Vicki. \\"A 'Real Man's Ring': Gender and the Invention of Tradition.\\" Journal of Social History.

Fellows (May 29, 1865 ‚Äì May 21, 1945) was an American inventor and entrepreneur from Torrington, Connecticut who designed and built a new type of gear shaper in 1896 and, with the mentoring of James Hartness, left the Jones & Lamson Machine Company to co-found the Fellows Gear Shaper Company in Springfield, Vermont, which became one of the leading firms in the gear- cutting segment of the machine tool industry. Fellows' machines made a vital contribution to the mass production of effective and reliable gear transmissions for the nascent automotive industry. By the conclusion of World War II, Fellows Gear Shaper Company machines were in defense contractor plants, manufacturing geared components for aircraft engines, tanks, instruments, cameras, fuses and other war-time materiel. Early life Early example of a Fellows gear cutter Fellows' father, Charles L. Fellows, was a principal of Torrington High School and was interested in mathematics. When his father died, Fellows was in his first year of high school. As a result of his father's death, Fellows had to go to work as a department store clerk while his mother had to take on lodgers. One such lodger was James Hartness, who was to become a machine-tool entrepreneur in Springfield, Vermont and who befriended Fellows and ultimately convinced him to follow career opportunities in the Springfield machine-tool industry with his firm, the Jones & Lamson Machine Company (J&L;). Roe reports that Fellows completed high school. Fellows moved to Springfield in 1889, working first at a screw-making machine before being transferred to the drafting department at J&L.; In this capacity he became interested in the problem of manufacturing gears, which requires accurate shaping according to mathematical principles in many different forms, including spur gears, worm gears, helical gears and spiral bevel gears. The problem employs the \\"study of involute cycloidal, epicycloidal and hypocycloidal curves.\\" By 1896 Fellows had fully developed a new approach to gear cutting. Previously, gears had been milled, using cutters that were formed to the shape of the individual teeth. Upon the completion of each gear tooth, the gear blank was indexed to a new position to mill the next tooth, which could lead to problems in accurate spacing of gear teeth and the shaping of the individual teeth. Fellows conceived a method whereby the gear cutter, which was itself a gear with hardened cutting edges, and gear blank revolved together as if they were a pair of gears. This process required no intermediate template or other type of mechanical guide for shaping the gear. Hobbing has become the preferred approach to manufacturing spur gears and helical gears. Fellows Gear Shaper Company Original \\"6-Type\\" production Fellows gear shaper, ca. 1897. =Tools for the mass-production of gears= Fellows obtained backing from several Springfield industrialists, including Hartness and William D. Woolson, who founded the Fellows Gear Shaper Company on July 13, 1896. Fellows became manager of the company and Woolson the president. The company built a manufacturing facility in Springfield and ordered a prototype machine from Fitchburg Machine Works. Original plant of the Fellows Gear Shaper Company in Springfield, Vermont, ca. 1897. The first \\"6-Type\\" production machine was built in 1897 and sold to a Worcester, Massachusetts machine-tool firm. Sales were then slow until the advent of the mass-produced automobile. By 1911 the Fellows Gear Shaper Company was thriving with 37 percent of its production going to Europe. Fellows became president and general manager of the company in 1917. At this time the company had developed: * A gear-generating machine, employing a reciprocating gear-like tool * A self-locking index-wheel system with worm-drive to control the cutter and work in the gear-generating machine. * A methodology for grinding involute curves in gears. * A ground master gear. * A gear-shaped planing tool for manufacturing helical gears. By 1924 the Fellows Gear Shaper Company, under the direction of Fellows, employed seven hundred men and was capable of producing one hundred gear shapers and four thousand cutters per month. Roe characterized the company's gear shapers as \\"one of the most important tools in the manufacture of automobiles.\\" =Tools for war-time production of gears= During World War II the Fellows Gear Shaper Company plant was enlarged to a peak work force of 3,300, including 400 women. The company's gear shaping machinery spanned extremes in capability between being able to produce gears with a 100-inch pitch diameter (the diameter at the bottom of the tooth) to 1/16-inch pitch diameter. By the conclusion of the war, Fellows Gear Shaper Company machines were in defense contractor plants manufacturing geared components, including: * Airplane propellor shaft webs. (Special Disking Machines). * Splines on aircraft engine crankshafts (Horizontal Z-Model). * Helical gears for tank transmissions (No. 15B Gear Burnishing Machine). * Propellor gears for aircraft engines (No. 24 Hydro-Gear Lapper). * Fine-pitch gears for aircraft instruments, aerial cameras, bomb fuses, etc. (Straight-Line Gear Generator). Fellows resigned as general manager in 1939, but remained president and director of the company until his death in 1945. Fellows gear shapers continued to be manufactured and supported by Bourn & Koch, Inc. of Rockford, Illinois, as of 2002. Patents and awards Fellows received 39 patents pertaining to gear shaping, generating, grinding and measuring machines. The Franklin Institute awarded him the John Scott Medal in 1899.

It is a 10 inch pork wiener wrapped in a steamed bun. The hot dog is sold at Dodger Stadium located in Los Angeles, California. According to the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council, the projected number of 2011 season hot dogs sold at Dodger Stadium was 2 million‚Äîestablishing Farmer John Dodger Dogs as the leader in hot dog sales of all those sold in Major League Baseball ballparks. There are two lines for Dodger Dog vendors: steamed or grilled. The vendors of the grilled dogs are typically located near the back wall of the stadium so that the smoke doesn't overwhelm the baseball fans. The grilled Dogs are considered the \\"classic\\" version. Background The success of the Dodger Dog has spawned a small chain of restaurants in the Southern California area. One such restaurant named Dodger Dogs can be found in Universal City, California. The Dodger Dog is also available in the ‚ÄúSuper Dodger Dog‚Äù variation, which is made of 100% beef as opposed to 100% pork. It is believed that Dodger Dogs were first called \\"Dodger Dogs\\" in 1958 when the Dodgers first came to Los Angeles from Brooklyn. Dodger Dog wieners are also sold to the public in Southern California supermarkets under the Farmer John brand. In 2011, the Dodgers introduced a Mexican-themed \\"Doyer Dog\\" which are made with chili, salsa, jalepe√±os, and condiments replacing the standard ketchup and mustard on a typical hotdog. The Dodger Dog is also served at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark in Oklahoma City, OK, the home of the Dodgers AAA affiliate Oklahoma City Dodgers. A concession area called the \\"Dog Pound\\" serves hot dogs from stadiums around the country including the Fenway Frank, Cincinnati Cheese Coney, Milwaukee Brat, and The Red Hot Chicago Dog. The Dodger Dog was not, however, served at the Dodgers' spring training ballpark, Camelback Ranch, during the team's first spring training at the park. This was changed for the 2010 Spring Training season where the Dodger Dog was either cooked on a hot dog roller or steamed. Creator Thomas Arthur created the \\"Dodger Dog\\" during his 29 years (1962‚Äì1991) as the food concessions manager at Dodger Stadium. Originally, the 10 inch dog was sold as a \\"Foot Long,\\" but Thomas Arthur decided truth in advertising was the best path. He approached Walter O'Malley, majority owner of the Dodgers, and asked if the Hot Dog could be called a \\"Dodger Dog\\" which became such a staple for Dodger fans that Vincent Price described its deliciousness in his cookbook, Treasury of Great Recipes. The 10-inch wiener was originally made by the Morrell Meat Company, but Farmer John, one of the Dodgers' chief sponsors, soon took over the hot dog needs of the stadium. Farmer John was purchased by Hormel in 2004. Farmer John was purchased from Hormel by Smithfield Foods in 2017. In popular culture Agent Mulder in the E.B.E. episode of The X-Files claimed that Dodger Dogs gave him \\"swamp gas.\\"}} * In Hancock, Jason Bateman's character, Ray, compares Hancock (Will Smith) to a Dodger Dog, saying \\"It's something people don't think they're gonna like, but then they try it, and they love it!\\" * In The Sandlot, all of the kids on the team make fun of Scott Smalls (Tom Guiry) by calling him a L-7 weenie, a footlong, a Dodger Dog, a weenie. * Johnny Drama in the \\"Manic Monday\\" episode of Entourage complains that Vince making him late won't let him get a Dodger Dog. * In episode #1000 of The Joe Rogan Experience, at 2:08:00 comedian Joey Diaz voices his dislike for Dodger Dogs, likening them to American Airlines's Oatmeal.

The cemetery was established in 1848 as a public municipal cemetery of the town of Roxbury, but was privatized when Roxbury was annexed to Boston. Overview Forest Hills Cemetery is located in the southern part of Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood. It is roughly bounded on the southwest by Walk Hill Street, the southeast, by the American Legion Highway, and the northeast by the Arborway and Morton Street, where its entrance is located. To the northwest, it is separated from Hyde Park Avenue by a small residential area. It abuts Franklin Park, which lies to the northeast, and is a short distance from the Arnold Arboretum to the northwest, and forms a greenspace that augments the city's Emerald Necklace of parkland. The cemetery has a number of notable monuments, including some by famous sculptors. Among these are Daniel Chester French's Death Staying the Hand of the Sculptor and John Wilson's Firemen's Memorial. Forest Hills Cemetery is an active cemetery where interments take place on most days of the year. History On March 28, 1848, Roxbury City Council (the municipal board in charge of the area at that time) gave an order for the purchase of the farms of the Seaverns family to establish a rural municipal park cemetery. Inspired by the Mount Auburn Cemetery, Forest Hills Cemetery was designed by Henry A. S. Dearborn to provide a park-like setting to bury and remember family and friends. In the year the cemetery was established, another were purchased from John Parkinson. This made for a little more than at a cost of $27,894. The area was later increased to . In 1893, the first crematorium in Massachusetts was added to the cemetery, along with other features like a scattering garden, an indoor columbarium and an outdoor columbarium. In 1927, anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were cremated here after their execution; their ashes were later returned to Italy Notable persons interred at Forest Hills Death Staying the Hand of the Sculptor (Martin Milmore Monument), by Daniel Chester French (1889-93).

According to the 2016 Australian Census, the combined number of people who self-identified as Muslim in Australia, from all forms of Islam, constituted 604,200 people, or 2.6% of the total Australian population, an increase of over 15% of its previous population share of 2.2% reported in the previous census 5 years earlier. Of that earlier 2.2% figure, \\"some estimate more than half are non-practicing\\" cultural Muslims stemming from all the varying denominations and sects of Islam present in Australia. That total Muslim population makes Islam, in all its denominations and sects, the second largest religious grouping in Australia, after all denominations and sects of Christianity (52.2%,https://web.archive.org/web/20170920073309/http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/2071.0~2016~Main%20Features~Religion%20Data%20Summary~25 also including practicing and non-practicing cultural Christians). Demographers attribute Muslim community growth trends during the most recent census period to relatively high birth rates, and recent immigration patterns. Adherents of Islam represent the majority of the population in Cocos (Keeling) Islands, an external territory of Australia. The vast majority of Muslims in Australia belong to the two major denominations of Islam, the Sunni and Shia denominations, with the followers of each of these further split along different Madh'hab (schools of thought within Islamic jurisprudence for the interpretation and practice of Islamic law). There are also practitioners of other smaller denominations of Islam, including Ahmadiyya Muslim Australians of various national backgrounds, Ibadi Muslim Australians of Omani descent, as well as some non-denominational Muslims, and approximately 20,000 Druze Australians whose religion emerged as an offshoot of Islam which arrived in Australia with the immigration of Druze mainly from Lebanon and Syria. There are also Sufi (Islamic mysticism) minorities among Muslim practitioners in Australia. While the overall Australian Muslim community is defined largely by a common religious identity with \\"Islam\\", Australia's Muslims are not a monolithic community. The Australian Muslim community is fragmented into not only the traditional sectarian divisions of what each sect defines as Islam, but it is also extremely diverse racially, ethnically, culturally and linguistically. Different Muslim groups within the Australian Muslim community thus also espouse parallel non-religious ethnic identities with related non- Muslim counterparts, either within Australia or abroad. History =Prior to 1860= Indonesian Muslims trepangers from the southwest corner of Sulawesi visited the coast of northern Australia, \\"from at least the eighteenth century\\" to collect and process trepang, a marine invertebrate prized for its culinary and medicinal values in Chinese markets. Remnants of their influence can be seen in the culture of some of the northern Aboriginal peoples. Regina Ganter, an associate professor at Griffith University, says, \\"Staying on the safe grounds of historical method ... the beginning of the trepang industry in Australia [can be dated] to between the 1720s and 1750s, although this does not preclude earlier, less organised contact.\\" Ganter also writes \\"the cultural imprint on the Yolngu people of this contact is everywhere: in their language, in their art, in their stories, in their cuisine.\\"Ganter, R.(2008) Journal of Australian Studies, Volume 32,4, 2008: \\"Muslim Australians: the deep histories of contact.\\" Retrieved on 6 April 2012 According to anthropologist John Bradley from Monash University, the contact between the two groups was a success: \\"They traded together. It was fair - there was no racial judgement, no race policy.\\" Even into the early 21st century, the shared history between the two peoples is still celebrated by Aboriginal communities in Northern Australia as a period of mutual trust and respect. Others who have studied this period have come to a different conclusion regarding the relationship between the Aboriginal people and the visiting trepangers. Anthropologist Ian McIntosh has said that the initial effects of the Macassan fishermen were \\"terrible\\", which resulted in \\"turmoil\\" with the extent of Islamic influence being \\"indeterminate\\". In another paper McIntosh concludes, \\"strife, poverty and domination . . is a previously unrecorded legacy of contact between Aborigines and Indonesians.\\" A report prepared by the History Department of the Australian National University says that the Macassans appear to have been welcomed initially, however relations deteriorated when, \\"aborigines began to feel they were being exploited . . leading to violence on both sides\\". A number of \\"Mohammedans\\" were listed in the musters of 1802, 1811, 1822, and the 1828 census, and a small number of Muslims arrived during the convict period. Beyond this, Muslims generally are not thought to have settled in large numbers in other regions of Australia until 1860. Muslims were among the earliest settlers of Norfolk Island while the island was used as a British penal colony in the early 19th century. They arrived from 1796, having been employed on British ships. They left following the closure of the penal colony and moved to Tasmania. The community left no remnants; only seven permanent residents of the island identified themselves as \\"non-Christian\\" in a 2006 census. =1860 onward: cameleers and pearlers= 19th-century mosque in cemetery, Bourke, New South WalesThe grave of an Afghan cameleer Among the early Muslims were the \\"Afghan\\" camel drivers who migrated to and settled in Australia during the mid to late 19th century. Between 1860 and the 1890s a number of Central Asians came to Australia to work as camel drivers. Camels were first imported into Australia in 1840, initially for exploring the arid interior (see Australian camel), and later for the camel trains that were uniquely suited to the demands of Australia's vast deserts. The first camel drivers arrived in Melbourne, Victoria, in June 1860, when eight Muslims and Hindus arrived with the camels for the Burke and Wills expedition. The next arrival of camel drivers was in 1866 when 31 men from Rajasthan and Baluchistan arrived in South Australia with camels for Thomas Elder. Although they came from several countries, they were usually known in Australia as 'Afghans' and they brought with them the first formal establishment of Islam in Australia.Jones, Philip G and Kenny, Anna (2007) Australia‚Äôs Muslim cameleers: pioneers of the inland, 1860s‚Äì1930s Kent Town, S. Aust. : Wakefield Press. Cameleers settled in the areas near Alice Springs and other areas of the Northern Territory and inter-married with the Indigenous population. The Adelaide, South Australia to Darwin, Northern Territory, railway is named The Ghan (short for The Afghan) in their memory. The first mosque in Australia was built in 1861 at Marree, South Australia. The Great Mosque of Adelaide was built in 1888 by the descendants of the Afghan cameleers. During the 1870s, Muslim Malay divers were recruited through an agreement with the Dutch to work on Western Australian and Northern Territory pearling grounds. By 1875, there were 1800 Malay divers working in Western Australia. Most returned to their home countries. One of the earliest recorded Islamic festivals celebrated in Australia occurred on 23 July 1884 when 70 Muslims assembled for Eid prayers at Albert Park, Melbourne. ‚ÄúDuring the whole service the worshippers wore a remarkably reverential aspect.‚Äù‚ÄúMahomedan Festival in Melbourne‚Äù, Auckland Star, 16 August 1884, page 3. = 20th century = Most of the cameleers returned to their countries after their work had dried up, but a few had brought wives and settled in Australia with their families, and others settled either on their own (some living at the Adelaide Mosque), or married Aboriginal or European women. Halimah Schwerdt, secretary to Mahomet Allum, a former cameleer who established himself as herbalist, healer and philanthropist in Adelaide, became first European woman in Australia to publicly embrace Islam. She was engaged to Allum in 1935-37, but there is no record of a wedding. He married Jean Emsley in 1940, who converted to Islam later. Allam also published pamphlets and articles about Islam. From 1901, under the provisions of the White Australia policy, immigration to Australia was restricted to persons of white European descent (including white Europeans of the Muslim faith). Meanwhile, persons not of white European heritage (including most Muslims) were denied entry to Australia during this period, and those already settled were not granted Australian citizenship. Online version of 2010 ed. at Google Books Replica of ice cream van owned by one of the killers in the 1915 \\"Battle of Broken Hill\\". Notable events involving Australian Muslims during this early period include what has been described either as an act of war by the Ottoman Empire, or the earliest terrorist attack planned against Australian civilians.Murphy, Damien. \\"Broken Hill an act of war or terrorism won't be commemorated.\\" Sydney Morning Herald. 31 October 2014. The attack was carried out at Broken Hill, New South Wales, in 1915, in what was described as the Battle of Broken Hill. Two Afghans who pledged allegiance to the Ottoman Empire shot and killed four Australians and wounded seven others before being killed by the police.Stevens, Christine. Tin Mosques and Ghantowns; A History of Afghan Cameldrivers in Australia. Oxford University Press. Melbourne 1989, p. 163 In the 1920s and 1930s Albanian Muslims, whose European heritage made them compatible with the White Australia Policy, immigrated to the country. Albanian Muslims built the first mosque in Shepparton, Victoria (1956-1960), first mosque in Melbourne (1967-1969) and another in 1968, and a mosque in Mareeba, Far North Queensland (1969-1970). The Albanian community in Far North Queensland settled in the area in the early 20th century searching for work in the sugarcane and tobacco industries with many descendants still living in Mareeba, Cairns and other small towns across the Atherton Tablelands. Post-war migration The perceived need for population growth and economic development in Australia led to the broadening of Australia's immigration policy in the post-World War II period. This allowed for the acceptance of a number of displaced white European Muslims who began to arrive from other parts of Europe, mainly from the Balkans, especially from Bosnia and Herzegovina. As with the Albanian Muslim immigrants before them, the European heritage of these displaced Muslims also made them compatible with the White Australia Policy. With the increase in immigration of Muslims after the war from countries such as Cyprus, Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Poland and Russia, the Islam in Australia developed its characteristic plurality. The move proved enriching for Muslim migrants, who \\"met Muslim fellows from many different ethnic, racial, cultural, sectarian and linguistic backgrounds\\" and \\"found Islam more pluralistic and more sophisticated\\" than their countries of origin. Later, between 1967 and 1971, during the final years of the step-by-step dismantling of the White Australia policy, approximately 10,000 Turkish citizens settled in Australia under an agreement between Australia and Turkey. From the 1970s onwards, there was a significant shift in the government's attitude towards immigration, and with the White Australia policy now totally dismantled from 1973 onwards, instead of trying to make newer foreign nationals assimilate and forgo their heritage, the government became more accommodating and tolerant of differences by adopting a policy of multiculturalism. The Chullora Greenacre Mosque Larger- scale Muslim migration of non-White non-European Muslims began in 1975 with the migration of Lebanese Muslims, which rapidly increased during the Lebanese Civil War from 22,311 or 0.17% of the Australian population in 1971, to 45,200 or 0.33% in 1976. Lebanese Muslims are still the largest and highest-profile Muslim group in Australia, although Lebanese Christians form a majority of Lebanese Australians, outnumbering their Muslim counterparts at a 6-to-4 ratio. 1990s Trade and educational links have been developed between Australia and several Muslim countries. Muslim students from countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, are among the thousands of international students studying in Australian universities. A number of Australian Arabs experienced anti-Arab backlash during the First Gulf War (1990‚Äì91). Newspapers received numerous letters calling for Arab Australians to \\"prove their loyalty\\" or \\"go home\\", and some Arab Australian Muslim women wearing hijab head coverings were reportedly harassed in public. The Australian government's Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission included accounts of racial harassment experienced by some Australian Arabs in their 1991 report on racism in Australia. =21st century= By the beginning of the 21st-century, Muslims from more than sixty countries had settled in Australia. While a very large number of them come from Bosnia, Turkey, and Lebanon, there are Muslims from Indonesia, Malaysia, Iran, Fiji, Albania, Sudan, Somalia, Egypt, the Palestinian territories, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, among others. At the time of the 2011 census, 476,000 Australians (representing 2.2 percent of the population) reported Islam as their religion. On a few occasions in the 2000s and 2010s, tensions have flared between Australian Muslims and the general population. The Sydney gang rapes formed a much-reported set of incidents in 2000; a group of Lebanese men sexually assaulted non-Muslim women. In 2005, tensions between Muslims and non-Muslims in the Cronulla area of Sydney led to violent rioting; the incident resulted in mass arrests and criminal prosecution. In 2012, Muslims protesting in central Sydney against Innocence of Muslims, an anti-Islam film trailer, resulted in rioting.\\"Govt Hopes No Islamic Protests In Melbourne.\\" Nine MSN. Accessed 20 September 2014. There was an increase in anti-Muslim sentiment in the aftermath of the Sydney hostage crisis on 15‚Äì16 December 2014, including a threat made against a mosque in Sydney. However, the Muslim community also received support from the Australian public through a social media campaign.\\"#illridewithyou: support for Muslim Australians takes off following Sydney siege.\\" ABC News. 15 December 2014.\\"Sydney cafe: Australians say to Muslims 'I'll ride with you.'\\" BBC. 16 December 2014. The founding president of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils has said that with moderate Muslims being sidelined by those promoting more fundamentalist views, there is a need to be more careful in regard to potential Australian immigrants. Keysar Trad has said moderate Muslims need to take back control. An article in The Australian in May 2015 opined, \\"Most Muslims want the peace and prosperity that comes from an Islam that coexists with modernity; it is a fanatical fringe that seeks to impose a fabricated medieval Islam\\". It describes Dr Jamal Rifi as a brave insider who is working to assist \\"the cause of good Muslims who are struggling for the soul of Islam\\". Schools of jurisprudence in Australia Most Australian Muslims are Sunni, with Shia then Sufi and Ahmadiyya as minorities. =Sunni= In Sydney, adherents of the Sunni denomination of Islam are concentrated in the suburb of Lakemba and surrounding areas such as Punchbowl, Wiley Park, Bankstown and Auburn. In Australia there are also groups associated with the \\"hardline\\" Salafi branch of Sunni Islam, including the Islamic Information and Services Network of Australasia and Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah Association (Australia) (ASWJA). While their numbers are small, the ASWJA is said to \\"punch above its weight\\". There are communities of NSW Muslims who adhere to Tablighi Jamaat form of Islam and worship at the Granville, Al Noor Masjid, which is led by Sheik Omar El-Banna. Similarly many Bangladeshi Tablighi Jamaat, Muslims worship at mosques in Seaton, NSW and in Huntingdale Victoria. Dawateislami, which is a \\"non- political Islamic organisation based in Pakistan\\", has adherents in Australia. In 2015, Wikileaks cables released information that Saudi Arabia closely monitores the situation of Islam and Arab community in Australia, whilst at the same time spending considerately to promote its fundamentalist version of Sunni Islam within the country. =Shia= Ashura outside the Opera House, Sydney. The Shi'a denomination of Islam is centred in the St George, Campbelltown, Fairfield, Auburn and Liverpool regions of Sydney, with the al- Zahra Mosque, built in Arncliffe in 1983, and the Al-Rasool Al-A'dham Mosque serves the region in Bankstown. In 2008, the mainstream Shia community numbered 30,000 followers nationally. In October 2004 Sheikh Mansour Leghaei established the Imam Hasan Centre in Annangrove, NSW. In November 2014, up to 3,000 Shi'a Muslims marched in Sydney on the annual Ashura Procession to mark the death of the prophet's grandson. In November 2015 there was Ashura march in Sydney and a Victorian school observed Muharram. There are also others from smaller non-mainstream sects of Shia Islam, including approximately 20,000 Alawites from Turkish, Syrian and Lebanese backgrounds. They have at least one school called Al Sadiq College, with campuses in the Sydney suburbs of Yagoona and Greenacre. There is also a population of the related, though distinct, Alevis. There is also an Ismaili population of unspecified size. While Dawoodi Bohra, a small Ismaili Shia sect has its Sydney Jamaat located in Auburn NSW. Additionally, the Druze, who practice Druzism, a religion that began as an offshoot of 11th-century Ismaili Shiite Islam, are reported to have around 20,000 followers living in Australia. =Sufi= The study of the history of Sufism in Australia is a fledgling discipline. Initial examination indicates that the Sufis have played an important part in Muslim engagement with Australia and its peoples. Some of the cameleers who came from Afghanistan, India and other countries in the 19th century were Sufis. Baron Friedrich von Frankenberg, who was inspired by the man who first brought to the West, Inayat Khan, moved to Australia from Germany with his family in 1927. He was, according to research fellow Dzavid Haveric, a \\"pioneer of the Sufi movement in Australia\\". The baron and his Australian wife were well-liked, and students would study Sufism under von Frankenberg at their home in Camden, New South Wales. In 1939 he organised the visit of a renowned Sufi leader, or Murshida, and devotee of Khan, known as Murshida Rabia Martin. Born Ada Ginsberg, the daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants to the US, Martin's visit was of great significance because of her link to Khan. After the baron's death in 1950, the poet and artist Francis Brabazon, student of Meher Baba, another early spiritual teacher took up a leadership role. Currently there are communities representing most of the major Sufi Orders within Australia. There are communities of Sufis, estimated to number about 5,000, most notably the Ahbash, who operate under the name Islamic Charitable Projects Association. The communities are linked to Darulfatwa - Islamic High Council of Australia and run Al Amanah College, as well as a mosque and a community radio station in suburban Sydney. There have been tensions between the Ahbash and other Muslim communities. =Ahmadiyya= Baitul Huda Ahmadiyya Mosque, Sydney located in Marsden Park. The Ahmadiyya community is reported to have 3,000 followers in Australia. There are 4 Ahmadiyya mosques in Australia in Sydney; Masjid Bait-ul Huda, Melbourne; Masjid Bait-ul Salam, Brisbane; Masjid Bait-ul Masroor and Adelaide; Masjid Mahmood. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has its headquarters located at the Masjid Bait-ul Huda, Marsden Park to the west of Sydney. The leaders of the Ahmadiyya community condemn terrorism, support law enforcement authorities, advocate speaking English and being loyal to Australia. Ahmadiyya Muslim Association Australia national spokesman Aziz Omer said, \\"We are loyal to Australia and we want our kids to be loyal to Australia\\", with association members delivering 500,000 Loyalty to Homeland leaflets. Ahmadi Muslims have been subject to various forms of intra-Muslim religious persecution and discrimination. =Sectarian tensions= Conflict between religious groups in the Middle East are reflecting as tensions within the Australian community and in the schools. Religious life The Australian Muslim community has built a number of mosques and Islamic schools, and a number of imams and clerics act as the community's spiritual and religious leaders. In 2007, Hilaly was succeeded by Fehmi Naji in June 2007 who was succeeded by the current Grand Mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed in September 2011. Sunshine Mosque located in Melbourne serves the Turkish Cypriot community. Fatwas, edicts based on Islamic jurisprudence which aim to provide \\"guidance to Muslim Australians in the personal, individual and private spheres of life\\",http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1205&context;=lawpapers are issued by various Australian Islamic authorities. =Organisations= A number of organisations and associations are run by the Australian Islamic community including mosques, private schools and charities and other community groups and associations. Broad community associations which represent large segments of the Australian Muslim public are usually termed \\"Islamic councils\\". Some organisations are focused on providing assistance and support for specific sectors within the community, such as women. Two organisations with strong political emphasis are Hizb ut-Tahrir which describes itself as a, \\"political party whose ideology is Islam\\" and Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah Association (ASWJA). A number of financial institutions have developed Sharia- compliant finance products, with university courses leading to Islamic financial qualifications also being established. Other Australian Islamic organisations have been set up to manage sharia-compliant investments, superannuation, Islamic wills and zakat management. =Halal certification= There are close to two dozen Halal certification authorities in Australia. Halal meat and meat product exports to the Middle East and Southeast Asia have greatly increased from the 1970s onwards; this expansion was due in part to efforts of the AFIC. Halal certification has been criticised by anti-Halal campaigners who argue that the practice funds the growth of Islam, results in added costs, a requirement to officially certify intrinsically-halal foods and with consumers required to subsidise a particular religious belief. An inquiry by an Australian Senate committee, which concluded in December 2015, found the current system is \\"lacklustre\\" and made recommendations for improvement. It found there was no evidence to support claims that the profits of halal certification are used to fund terrorism. The report recognised that halal certification has economic benefits for Australia because of increased export opportunities. It recommended that the federal government increase its oversight of halal certifiers to address fraudulent conduct, with halal products to be clearly labelled and for meat products sourced from animals subject to religious slaughter, to be specifically labelled. It said that it had heard, \\"credible reports suggesting that the lack of regulation has been unscrupulously exploited\\". In tabling the report, committee chairman Sam Dastyari said, \\"Some certifiers are nothing more than scammers.\\" The committee recommended a single halal certification authority. The committee in recommending clearer labelling, specifically referred to the need for meat processors to label products sourced from animals subject to religious slaughter. Demography =Historical population= During the 1980s the Australian Muslim population increased from 76,792 or 0.53% of the Australian population in 1981, to 109,523 or 0.70% in 1986. In the 2011 Census, the Muslim population was 479,300 or 2.25%, an increase of 438% on the 1981 number. The general increase of the Muslim population in this decade was from 147,487 or 0.88% of the Australian population in 1991, to 200,885 or 1.12% in 1996. In 2005 the overall Muslim population in Australia had grown from 281,600 or 1.50% of the general Australian population in 2001, to 340,400 or 1.71% in 2006. The growth of Muslim population at this time was recorded as 3.88% compared to 1.13% for the general Australian population.. From 2011-2016, Muslim population grew by 27% from 476,291 to 604,200 with majority residing in New South Wales. The following is a breakdown of the country of birth of Muslims in Australia from 2001: There were 281,578 Muslims recorded in this survey; in the 2006 census the population had grown to 340,392. 48% of Australian-born Muslims claimed Lebanese or Turkish ancestry. The distribution by state of the nation's Islamic followers has New South Wales with 50% of the total number of Muslims, followed by Victoria (33%), Western Australia (7%), Queensland (5%), South Australia (3%), ACT (1%) and both Northern Territory and Tasmania sharing 0.3%. The majority of people who reported Islam as their religion in the 2006 Census were born overseas: 58% (198,400). Of all persons affiliating with Islam in 2006 almost 9% were born in Lebanon and 7% were born in Turkey. =Areas= At the 2011 census, people who were affiliated with Islam as a percentage of the total population in Australia divided geographically by statistical local area At the 2011 census, people who were affiliated with Islam as a percentage of the total population in Sydney divided geographically by postal area According to the , the Muslim population numbered 604,235 individuals, of whom 42% live in Greater Sydney, 31% in Greater Melbourne, and 8% in Greater Perth. The states and territories with the highest proportion of Muslims are New South Wales (3.58%) and Victoria (3.32%), whereas those with the lowest are Queensland (0.95%) and Tasmania (0.49%). 4.2% of people in Greater Melbourne are Muslim. Many Muslims living there are Bosnian and Turkish. Melbourne's Australian Muslims live primarily in the northern suburbs surrounding Broadmeadows, (mostly Turkish), Coburg, Brunswick and Epping (mostly Lebanese) and a few in the outer southern suburbs such as Noble Park and Dandenong (mainly Bosnian). Very few Muslims live in rural areas with the exceptions of the sizeable Turkish and Albanian community in Shepparton, which has Victoria's oldest mosque, and Malays in Katanning, Western Australia. A community of Iraqis have settled in Cobram on the Murray River in Victoria. There has been an established Albanian Muslim community in Mareeba, Far north Queensland from the 1920s, where they established Queensland's second oldest mosque. Perth also has a Muslim community focussed in and around the suburb of Thornlie, where there is a mosque. Perth's Australian Islamic School has around 2,000 students on three campuses. Mirrabooka and Beechboro contain predominantly Bosnian communities. The oldest mosque in Perth is the Perth Mosque on William Street in Northbridge. It has undergone many renovations although the original section still remains. Other mosques in Perth are located in Rivervale, Mirrabooka, Beechboro and Hepburn. There are also communities of Muslims from Turkey, the Indian subcontinent (Pakistan, India and Bangladesh) and South-East Asia, in Sydney and Melbourne, the Turkish communities around Auburn, New South Wales and Meadow Heights and Roxburgh Park and the South Asian communities around Parramatta. Indonesian Muslims, are more widely distributed in Darwin. =Communities= It is estimated that Australian Muslims come from 63 different backgrounds, with \\"loose associations\\" between them. Aboriginal Muslims According to Australia's 2011 census, 1,140 people identify as Aboriginal Muslims, almost double the number of Aboriginal Muslims recorded in the 2001 census. Many are converts and some are descendants of Afghan cameleers or, as in the Arnhem Land people, have Macassan ancestry as a result of the historical Makassan contact with Australia.http://islamicsydney.com/story.php?id=826/ In north east Arnhem Land, there is some Islamic influence on the songs, paintings, dances, prayers with certain hymns to Allah and funeral rituals like facing west during prayers, roughly the direction of Mecca, and ritual prostration reminiscent of the Muslim sujud. As a result of Malay indentured laborers, plenty of families in Northern Australia have names like Doolah, Hassan and Khan. Notable Aboriginal Muslims include the boxer Anthony Mundine and Rugby League footballer Aidan Sezer.Kathy Marks, The Independent Militant Aborigines embrace Islam to seek empowerment. 28 February 2003 . Retrieved 1 February 2007. Many indigenous converts are attracted to Islam because they see a compatibility between Aboriginal and Islamic beliefs, while others see it as a fresh start and an aid against common social ills afflicting indigenous Australians, such as alcohol and drug abuse. Some academics who have studied these issues have come to less positive conclusions regarding the relationship between the Aboriginal people and the visiting trepangers. Bangladeshi Muslims According to the 2016 Australian Census, Bangladeshi origin population were around 55,000; among them about 33,000 were living in NSW. Bangladeshi Muslims are located primarily in Rockdale, Lakemba, Bankstown and many suburbs in Western Sydney region with a mosque in Sefton and in the south-east of Melbourne, with a mosque at Huntingdale. The Sefton Mosque has been linked to the Tablighi Jamaat School of Islam and has hosted Hizb ut- Tahrir. For Bangladeshi Muslims attending the Huntingdale Mosque, all Islamic lunar months, such as Ramadan are observed using local moon-sightings, rather than being based on Middle-Eastern, or other, timings. Bosnian Muslims Bosnian Muslims have predominantly arrived in Australia after 1992, with most of the community living in the south east of Melbourne and in the south west of Sydney. There are Bosnian run mosques in Deer Park, Noble Park, and Penshurst. Egyptian Muslims Egyptian Muslims in Sydney are represented by The Islamic Egyptian Society. The Society has managed the Arkana College in Kingsgrove since 1986. It is reported that enrolments for its 203 co- educational places are booked out until 2020. Iraqi Australians Iraqi Muslims mainly came to the country as a refugees after the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, failed 1991 uprisings in Iraq, and then post-2003. They predominately settled in the western suburbs of Sydney, such as Fairfield and Auburn. Kurdish Muslims Kurdish Muslims have predominantly arrived in Australia since the second half of the 1980s, with most of the community settling in Melbourne and Sydney. Although the large majority of the Kurdish Australians are Muslims, there are no registered Kurdish run mosques in Australia. Lebanese Muslims Lebanese Muslims form the core of Australia's Muslim Arab population, particularly in Sydney where most Arabs in Australia live. Approximately 3.4% of Sydney's population are Muslim. Approximately 4.2% of residents in Greater Melbourne are Muslim, and Sydney Road in Brunswick and Coburg is sometimes called 'Little Lebanon'. In November 2016, Immigration Minister, Peter Dutton said that it was a mistake of a previous administration to have brought out Lebanese Muslim immigrants. Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop said Mr Dutton was making a specific point about those charged with terrorism offences. \\"He made it quite clear that he respects and appreciates the contribution that the Lebanese community make in Australia\\". Somali Muslims Although the first Somali community in Victoria was established in 1988, most Somalis began to settle in the country in the early 1990s following the civil war in Somalia. Somalis are active in the wider Australian Muslim community, and have also contributed significantly to local business. Turkish Muslims Turkish Muslims are a significant segment of the Australian Muslim community. Some statistical reports forecast the Turkish Muslim population in Australia surpassing the Lebanese Muslim population in the 2020s and 2030s. Melbourne has the largest Turkish community in Australia, with the majority of Turkish Muslims living around Broadmeadows and other northern suburbs. The majority of Turkish Muslims in Sydney are from Auburn, Eastlakes and Prestons. Despite still having a large Turkish population in Auburn and Eastlakes, many Turks moved out of these areas and moved to Prestons to be close to the new and growing Turkish private school, Amity College which is run by people closely affiliated with the Galaxy Foundation (formerly Feza Foundation). Malay Muslims Issues Concerns and contemporary issues facing the Australian Muslim community include rates of unemployment, the rights of women, concerns over Islamism and Islamic radicalism, among others. Islamic preachers and clerics in Australia have been covered in the Australian press on account of the messages they have delivered publicly to the Muslim community or have otherwise shared with others in public settings. In some instances, various ideas and viewpoints espoused by these preachers have been subject of public or internal debate. Statements viewed as misogynistic and radically paternalistic have come under criticism. =Radical Islam= A number of incidents have highlighted the issues associated with radical Islam in Australia, including terrorism and militant activity.Kabir, Nahid Afrose. Muslims in Australia: immigration, race relations and cultural history. Routledge, 2004. Several foreign terrorist organisations have sponsored the establishment of cells in Australia, including Lashkar-e-Taiba,Shandon Harris-Hogan. \\"The Australian Neojihadist network: Origins, evolution and structure.\\" Dynamics of Asymmetric Conflict, Volume 5, Issue 1.

A man known as \\"Ahmed Y\\" established a small militant group in Australia in 2001 and advocated the idea of establishing an Islamic State in Australia.Bendle, Mervyn F. \\"Secret Saudi funding of radical Islamic groups in Australia.\\" National Observer 72 (2007): 7. Groups led by Abdul Nacer Benbrika and Khaled Cheikho were active in Melbourne and Sydney, respectively, until police arrested their members in 2005.RACHEL OLDING, \\"Terrifying Legacy Emerges From Success of Operation Pendennis.\\" Sydney Morning Herald. 24 August 2014. Instances of domestic terror inspired by radical political Islam include the plots by Faheem Khalid Lodhi, Abdul Nacer Benbrika and Joseph T. Thomas. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), proscribed by the government as a terrorist organisation, has targeted Australian Muslims for recruitment. Making use of social media, recruiters target those vulnerable to radicalisation, and encourage local jihad activities. Some of those targeted have been minors, including a teenager who was arrested in Melbourne in May 2015 for plotting to detonate home-made bombs. In June 2014, the government claimed that roughly 150 Australians had been recruited to fight in the conflicts in Syria and Iraq.\\"Australia Warns of Islamic Militant Migration: Australia Increases Counterterrorism Strategies to Combat Threat.\\" The Wall Street Journal. 24 June 2014. A list released in April 2015 showed that most were young males who have come from a range of occupations, including students. It was also reported at the time that 20 Australians had been killed fighting overseas for terror groups, with 249 suspected jihadists prevented from leaving Australia. The Border Force Counter-Terrorism Unit, tasked with stopping jihadists from leaving the country, had cancelled more than 100 passports by the end of March 2015. Several jihadists have expressed the desire to return to Australia, but Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said that any who do would be prosecuted on their arrival. In December 2015 the Director General of ASIO Duncan Lewis stated that the number of Australians seeking to travel overseas to fight with groups such as ISIS had \\"plateaued a bit\\" due to better awareness of the issue among the Islamic community, few young Australians being attracted to ISIS and improvements to the speed with which passports could be cancelled. He also stated that a \\"tiny, tiny\\" proportion of Australian Muslims were influenced by ISIS. At this time the government believed there were around 110 Australians fighting with extremist groups, which was slightly lower than previous levels, and 44 Australians had been killed in Syria. In an Australia-wide survey published in November 2015, which was based on 1,573 interviews, which asked, \\"What is the likelihood that Islamic State will carry out a large scale terrorist attack in Australia?\\" 24% of the respondents said \\"it is inevitable\\", 23% said \\"very likely\\" and 29% said \\"likely\\". Greens' voters were least concerned about an attack. In May 2017, answering the questions during the Australian Senate-hearing, Duncan Lewis, the director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, stated that there's de facto no connection between refugees and terrorism in Australia whilst adding: \\"But the context is very important. The reason they are terrorists is not because they are refugees but because of the violent, extremist interpretation of Sunni Islam that they have adopted.\\" Saudi influence Saudi Arabia has been involved in the funding of Sunni-Salafi mosques, schools and charitable organisations, a university and Australian Islamic institutions, with estimates up to $120 million. This funding has generated tensions between Australian Muslim organisations. In 2015, it was uncovered by WikiLeaks, that the Saudi Government has provided finance to build Salafi mosques, to support Sunni Islamic community activities and to fund visits by Sunni clerics to \\"counter Shiite influence\\". Promotion of antisemitism The leader of Hizb ut-Tahrir has said that the Jews \\"are evil creatures\\", and the principal of Al-Taqwa College told students that ISIL is a scheme created by Israel. An Islamic bookstore in Lakemba was found to be selling a children's book that describes Jews as \\"much conceited\\" and intent on world domination. Sheik Taj el-Din al-Hilali, former Grand Mufti of Australia said, \\"Jews try to control the world through sex, then sexual perversion, then the promotion of espionage, treason and economic hoarding\\" with Christians and Jews being, \\"the worst in God's creation\\". At a Victorian university, a Muslim group held workshops based on the teachings of Islamic scholars who have recommended the death penalty for homosexuals and apostates, promoted terrorism and preached hatred of Jews and Christians. A Sheik who leads a Sydney prayer hall, told a group including children, that Jews, \\"don't have mercy. They don't have anything in the heart. They've got only envy (and) they've got hatred\\". Dvir Abramovich, a Jewish community leader, said he was deeply troubled by Sheik Hassan‚Äôs \\"divisive rhetoric\\". Promotion of extremism Material sold at some Sunni Islamic bookshops have raised concerns. For example, the Islamic Information Bookshop in Melbourne was stocking literature \\"calling for violence against non-Muslims\\"; the Al Risalah Bookshop was said to be \\"encouraging young Australians to fight in Syria\\"; and the Al-Furqan Bookshop was said to be polarising members with extreme views. The Bukhari House Islamic Bookshop in Auburn, New South Wales, which is aligned to the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah Association has featured heavily in counter-terrorism raids. The gunman responsible for the 2015 Parramatta shooting is said to have spent his final days under the influence of Bukhari House leaders. In Brisbane, the iQraa Bookstore was said to promote extremism. It was reported in 2015 that the al-Furqan and al-Risalah bookshops had both closed, but concern has been raised that this might be the \\"worst thing that could happen\\" as they provided a place for people to go to \\"express their frustrations\\". Responses A number of forums and meetings have been held about the problem of extremist groups or ideology within the Australian Islamic community. After the London bombings in 2005, Prime Minister John Howard established a Muslim Community Reference Group to assist governmental relations with the Muslim community. Sydney's Muslim leaders, including Keysar Trad, have condemned the actions of suicide bombers and denounced ISIS. The Shia community in Australia have also expressed their concern regarding ISIS. In February 2015, Ameer Ali former president of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils called on religious leaders to oppose Islamic State as, \\"I haven't heard so far any single imam in this country that has named IS and condemned it.\\" Glenn Mohammed a Muslim lawyer has written, \\"Muslims need to be able to discuss these issues openly and denounce barbaric behaviour. Instead, we choose to remain silent and then criticise a government that tries to make Australia safer.\\" Psychiatrist Tanveer Ahmed has examined underlying causes and has identified the significance of issues relating to 'family' and to 'denial'. He has said, \\"Muslim youths have unique difficulties in coming to terms with their identity, especially when they have conflicting value systems at home compared with school or work\\". In September 2014, the external affairs secretary of Australia's Ahmadiyya muslims, urged the Islamic community to denounce ISIS, \\"because they know very well that ISIS is responsible for brutal, reprehensible killings of Muslims in Syria and Iraq\\". Peter Jennings, Executive Director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has said Australian Muslim leaders need to recognise that there are a \\"disturbing number of radicalised ideologues\\" who do not believe Islam is peaceful. He says, \\"some dramatic self-healing is needed\\". In May 2015, the Abbott Government committed a further AU$450 million to fight home-grown terrorism. Muslim leaders have criticised the current Grand Mufti of Australia, following the Muftis response to the November 2015 Paris attacks. Ameer Ali has said, \\"The problem I have with the Mufti is he cannot communicate in English. That means he has to rely on the people around him.\\" Anthony Albanese described the Grand Mufti's contribution as \\"completely unacceptable\\". Josh Frydenberg along with other senior politicians have urged moderate Islamic leaders to speak with one voice against extremism. The founder of Australia‚Äôs biggest Muslim media organisation Ahmed Kilani is seeking a \\"revolution\\" within the Islamic community and has called upon Muslim leaders to unequivocally repudiate violence conducted in the name of Islam. Dr Recep Dogan of Charles Sturt University‚Äôs Centre for Islamic Sciences and Civilisation, said as Muslim leaders in Australia do not seem to be engaged at a community level. During an interview on ABC Lateline program, the authors of a book entitled Islam and the Future of Tolerance, Sam Harris, an atheist and neuroscientist, and Maajid Nawaz, a former Hizb-ut-Tahrir member, argued that Islam has failed to modernise. Harris said, \\"We have a task ahead of us, a monumental task ahead of us, and that is to begin the process of adapting, reinterpreting our scriptures for the modern day and age.\\" Politician Andrew Hastie has said, \\"Modern Islam needs to cohere with the Australian way of life, our values and institutions. In so far as it doesn‚Äôt, it needs reform.\\" Former federal Treasurer, Peter Costello has said, \\"Islamic scholars need to tell would-be jihadis, why these difficult sections of the Koran and the Hadiths,\\" which may have been acceptable in the 7th century, \\"are not to be taken literally and not to be followed today\\". Former Prime Minister, Tony Abbott has said, \\"there needs to be a concerted ‚Äòhearts and minds‚Äô campaign against the versions of Islam that make excuses for terrorists\\". However, Hizb ut-Tahrir (Australia) spokesman, Uthman Badar, said, \\"Islam is not up for negotiation or reform. Islam is what it is.\\" Hizb ut-Tahrir advocates capital punishment for apostates. Australia's Race Discrimination Commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane has said that Hizb ut-Tahrir's views are, \\"absurd.\\" In December 2015 the Grand Mufti of Australia and several high profile imams issued a new year's message supporting a fatwa against Islamic State. In the message they stated that \\"most Islamic Legal Circles and Fatwa Boards have condemned ISIS\\", and warned young people to avoid the organisation's propaganda. In March 2017, the Prime Minister said that since September 2014 Australian security forces have disrupted 12 planned domestic attacks and charged 62 people with terrorist- related offences. In December 2018, Australian authorities stripped a jihadist who had fought for ISIS and was held in Turkey on terror-related charges of his Australian citizenship. He had left Australia for Syria in 2013. The jihadist had both Australian and Fijian citizenship and according to Australian law, an individual holding dual citizenship can be stripped of citizenship if convicted or suspected of terror offences. =Discrimination= According to some scholars, a particular trend of anti-Muslim prejudice has developed in Australia since the late 1980s.Poynting, Scott, and Victoria Mason. \\"The resistible rise of Islamophobia Anti-Muslim racism in the UK and Australia before 11 September 2001.\\" Journal of Sociology 43, no. 1 (2007): 61-86. Since the 2001 World Trade Center attacks in New York, and the 2005 Bali bombings, Islam and its place in Australian society has been the subject of much public debate. A report published in 2004 by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission pointed to many Muslim Australians who felt the Australian media was unfairly critical of, and often vilified their community due to generalisations of terrorism and the emphasis on crime. The use of ethnic or religious labels in news reports about crime was thought to stir up racial tensions. After the White Australia immigration laws were replaced with multicultural policies the social disadvantage of Muslims was thought to have been alleviated. Some sources, however, note that Muslims now face some disadvantages on account of their religion. At times there has been opposition to the construction of new mosques in Australia. A 2014 report from the Islamic Sciences and Research Academy, University of Western Sydney, on mosques in New South Wales found that 44 percent of mosques in the state had \\"experienced resistance from the local community when the mosque was initially proposed\\". In around 20 percent of these cases opposition was from a small number of people. According to Michael Humphrey, a professor of sociology at the University of Sydney, much of Islamic culture and organisation in Australia has been borne of the social marginalisation experiences of Muslim working class migrants. This \\"immigrant Islam\\" is often viewed by the host society as a force of \\"cultural resistance\\" toward the multicultural and secular nature of the general Australian culture. Muslim practices of praying, fasting and veiling appear as challenging the conformity within public spaces and the values of gender equality in social relationships and individual rights. The immigrant Muslims are often required to \\"negotiate their Muslimness\\" in the course of their encounters with Australian society, the governmental and other social institutions and bureaucracies. A poll of nearly 600 Muslim residents of Sydney released in November 2015 found that the respondents were three to five times more likely to have experienced racism than the general Australian population. However, approximately 97 per cent of the Muslim respondents reported that they had friendly relations with non- Muslims and felt welcome in Australia. In an Australia-wide survey published in November 2015, which was based on 1,573 interviews, which asked, \\"Are Muslims that live in Australia doing enough to integrate into the Australian community, or should they be doing more?\\", only 20% of respondents thought Muslims are currently \\"doing enough\\". A poll conducted by the University of South Australia's International Centre for Muslim and non-Muslim Understanding which was released in 2016 found that 10 per cent of Australians have hostile attitudes towards Muslims. The accompanying report concluded that \\"the great majority of Australians in all states and regions are comfortable to live alongside Australian Muslims\\". A Council for the Prevention of Islamophobia Inc has been established. An Australian speaking tour by Ayaan Hirsi Ali, was proposed for April 2017. Because of her alleged Islamophobia, the Council for the Prevention of Islamophobia told organisers that there would be 5,000 protesters outside the Festival Hall in Melbourne if she was to speak at that venue. Her Australian tour was cancelled. It is likely that Austrlain Muslims are facing up to Six Times exclusion from the society.BIN AMIN, Umar.

ISSN 2442-9848 =Women's rights= As part of the broader issue of women's rights and Islam, the gender inequality in Islam has often been the focal point of criticism in Australia through comparisons to the situation of women in Islamic nations. Muslim women can face hurdles both from within the Muslim community and from the wider community. Following a successful appeal to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal by a Muslim lady, who believes it is a sin to be seen without a niqab, the policy of the Monash hospital is now for female doctors to attend to female patients, if requested. Several Melbourne councils have women-only sessions in their swimming pools. Monash Council has provided a curtain to ensure privacy for Muslim women. It has been reported that a \\"growing number of Muslim men [have] multiple wives\\"; the same story cited Islamic Friendship Association of Australia president Keysar Trad as stating that there were \\"not many more than 50\\" polygamist Muslim families in Australia. Centrelink has been paying spousal benefits to Islamic families with several wives, with Centrelink saying that the payment of spousal benefits for multiple wives is done to save taxpayers‚Äô money, rather than paying single-parent-benefits for each wife. The AFIC has advocated Australian Muslims being able to marry and divorce under the principles of Sharia law, saying that Australian Muslims should enjoy \\"legal pluralism\\". There are Sharia law based mediation centres in Sydney and Melbourne. To expedite a religious divorce, Australian Muslim women often agree to sharia law principles which result in an unequal distribution of assets and rights. A Melbourne based, Muslim lawyer has said, \\"his clients, almost all female, say they have been disadvantaged by Sharia settlements.\\" At a major Sydney mosque women are required to remain behind tinted glass on the second floor. The leader of the Islamic Information and Services Network of Australasia, Samir Abu Hamza has told his followers that it is permissible to hit women as a, \\"last resort\\" but, \\"you are not allowed to bruise them . . . or to make them bleed\\". In response, he said that his message was taken out of context. In March 2016 the New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal determined that separate male and female seating arrangements at public events hosted by Hizb ut-Tahrir contravened section 33 of the NSW Anti-Discrimination Act. The Tribunal ordered that all future publicity materials for public events hosted by Hizb ut-Tahrir must clearly inform attendees that segregated seating arrangements are not compulsory. In May 2016 the United Muslims of Australia held a conference in Sydney where genders were separated by a fence. The president of the Australian National Imams Council, Sheikh Shady Alsuleiman has said that women would be \\"hung by their breasts in hell\\" and women should not look at men. He has also said that women must obey their husbands to enter paradise. In February 2017 the promotional flyers for an Islamic Peace Conference, organised by the Islamic Research and Educational Academy, the three females had their faces replaced with black ink, while the faces of all other 12 male speakers were displayed. In February 2017, in response to a question regarding the meaning of Quran Chapter 4, Surah 34, Keysar Trad president of the AFIC said a husband can beat his wife, but only as \\"a last resort\\". He later apologised for his statements conceding Islam does allow for this, but saying he was \\"clumsy\\" in the television interview, adding that he condemns all violence against women. In April 2017 Hizb ut- Tahrir (Australia) produced a video in which two women discussed how to resolve marital conflicts. One of the women said, \\"a man is permitted to hit a woman as an act of discipline\\" and described the permissive text as \\"beautiful\\" and \\"a blessing\\". The video was strongly repudiated by Muslim leaders, with the women subsequently saying, \\"more thought needs to be given to the question of purpose, worth and risk of sharing content online. We acknowledge our mistake in this respect in this instance\\". =Children's rights= It has been reported that female circumcision has been carried out in New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. The act has been a criminal offence since the 1990s. The first criminal trial concerning female circumcision in Australia ended with the conviction of three members of the Dawoodi Bohra Shia Muslim community in November 2015 and in 2016 a community leader was imprisoned. There are reportedly 120,000 migrant women living in Australia who have had their genitals mutilated. A study, conducted by researchers from the Australian paediatric surveillance unit at Westmead Children's Hospital in Sydney, has determined at least 60 Australian girls, from the age of 6 months, have undergone female genital mutilation. The school uniform at Sydney's Al-Faisal College \\"thought to have the strictest uniform policy for girls in the country\\" requires summer and winter, ankle-length dresses, long-sleeved shirts, plus head covering, for girls, while the boys can wear short-sleeved shirts - has been described as discriminatory. There have been prosecutions under Australian law in regards to Islamic marriages involving underage girls. There have been allegations of failure by Australian authorities to respond to reports of child brides. However, the Australian Federal Police has stated that it is unable to follow up on the reports as they concern alleged child marriages which occurred before specific legislation outlawing the practice came into effect in March 2013, and the legislation was not retrospective. At a Sydney school, Muslim boys were told not to shake the hands of females presenting awards at the school. The instruction is understood to derive from an Islamic hadith which says, \\"it is better to be stabbed in the head with an iron needle than to touch the hand of a woman who is not permissible to you\\". There are claims that another Sydney public school is, \\"run like a mosque\\" with the school refusing to adopt a program aimed at countering violent religious extremism. The principal of the school was removed. =Views on homosexuality= In line with the views of most Islamic scholars world wide, Islamic leaders in Australia generally believe that homosexuality is not permitted by their faith. In June 2016, the president of the Australian National Imams Council (ANIC), Sheikh Shady Alsuleiman participated in an Iftar dinner at Kirribilli House hosted by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said he would not have been invited Alsuleiman had he known of his position regarding homosexuals. The sheikh had previously spoken about the \\"evil actions\\" of homosexuality. Australia's Grand Mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed has defended Alsuleiman, saying Islam has a, \\"longstanding\\" position on homosexuality\\" which \\"no person can ever change\\". He said that any attempt to call out its teachings could lead to radicalisation. ANIC treasurer Imam Mohamed Imraan Husain said, \\"Islam prevents lesbianism and being gay.\\" Uthman Badar spokesman for Hizb ut-Tahrir (Australia), said that Mr Turnbull was condemning the \\"normative Islamic position on homosexuality\\". Yusuf Peer, president of the Council of Imams Queensland, in referring to the sharia law death penalty for homosexuality said, \\"that is what Islam teaches and that will never change.\\" The Imam of Australia's largest mosque, located in Lakemba, NSW, Shaykh Yahya Safi has said, \\"In Islam we believe it's a major sin to have such relations between men and men, a sexual relation. We don't discuss this because it's obvious.\\" In August 2017 the National Imams Council issued a statement opposing the proposed introduction of same-sex marriage in Australia, and several individual religious leaders have also argued against same-sex marriage. However, some Australian Muslims support same-sex marriage, and the Muslims for Progressive Values and Muslims for Marriage Equality groups have campaigned in favour of such a reform. As of September 2017 there was no polling data on the Australian Islamic community's views on this issue. =Employment, education and crime= , average wages of Muslims were much lower than those of the national average, with just 5% of Muslims earning over $1000 per week compared to the average of 11%. Unemployment rates amongst Muslims born overseas were higher than Muslims born in Australia. Muslims are over-represented in jails in New South Wales, at 9% to 10% of the prison population, compared to less than 3% within the NSW population. In literature and film There are a number of notable works in Australian literature that discuss the Muslims during the \\"Afghan period\\" (1860-1900). *The Camel in Australia, by Tom L.

The documentary follows Frida as she develops her business in Melbourne while juggling a husband and home in Sydney and a pregnancy. Veiled Ambition won the Palace Films Award for Short Film Promoting Human Rights at the 2006 Melbourne International Film Festival.

Inverloch was initially published as a webcomic with new content introduced several pages at a time from 2003 to 2007. Three volumes have seen print with the first three volumes currently available from IndyPlanet and with the first two originally published by Seven Seas Entertainment. Inverloch received several nominations in the 2005, 2006 and 2007 Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards, winning the Outstanding Fantasy Comic category in 2005. During its web publication Inverloch was highly rated at both Topwebcomics and buzzComix online comic rating sites. The story of Inverloch follows the journey of Acheron and his companions to find the whereabouts of the elf Kayn'dar. It was scripted in December 2003, although it was constantly edited and refined throughout its production. Background, production and style =Background= Inverloch author Sarah Ellerton was already an experienced artist before she began the project, and says she chose to create a webcomic as a means of improving her art. Ellerton wrote out the script for the entire comic ahead of time, in December 2003, as a five-volume series. She began illustrating the comic in June 2004, updating twice a week with several new pages uploaded per update, and finished the comic in 2007. After finishing Inverloch, Ellerton began work on a second webcomic (the plot and setting of which are unrelated to those of Inverloch), called The Phoenix Requiem. That comic, like Inverloch, consists of five volumes and has a total of 800 pages; the last page was published on March 17, 2011. =Production= To create each page of Inverloch, Ellerton planned out the panels with sketches on paper and then drew and colored them in Adobe Photoshop using a Wacom graphics tablet. She drew each panel individually, rearranging, resizing, and organizing them in Photoshop. Each page is in book format, and the size and shapes of the panels within each page varies. Volume 1 of Inverloch was published in print form on May 15, 2006. Ellerton redrew the first five pages for the published version, saying that the artistic style had changed since those pages were originally produced. Volume 2 was published on November 15, 2006. Synopsis =Volume 1= The story of Inverloch begins when Acheron, a young da'kor, forms an unlikely friendship with Shiara, an elf. When Shiara reveals to him that her childhood love, Kayn'dar, disappeared twelve years earlier, Acheron promises to find him for her. When he explains to his mother that he will be leaving, it becomes apparent to him that his mother, brother, and uncle all know something about Kayn'dar, but are unwilling to tell him. Before leaving, Acheron also visits his uncle Selak, who gives him a pendant that was once owned by Kayn'dar. =Volume 2= Acheron first sets out to find Lei'ella, an elven woman whom one of the da'kor says can help him find Kayn'dar. While searching for her in the human town of Strathwood, he is assaulted by Berard, a human criminal who captures da'kor to use in gladiatorial fighting rings. At that moment Lei'ella appears and rescues him, after which he explains his goal and she agrees to join him. From there they travel to Rhyll, where Acheron catches a thief named Varden trying to steal from him; Varden claims that he must now serve Acheron, according to the \\"thieves' code,\\" and Acheron allows him to join their group. At Lei'ella's suggestion, they go to Aydensfell, a city inhabited by humans who have traces of elven blood and study magic. The Archmage of Aydensfell tells Acheron that he should seek someone named Silvah, rather than Kayn'dar, and allows a young mage named Neirren to join them. =Volume 3= The group then travels to a city called Muirfold to search for Silvah. In the city they split up to ask about his whereabouts, and Acheron is captured by Berard, who had been following them. To rescue Acheron and prevent Berard from following them in the future, Varden approaches Berard and requests to fight Acheron in the gladiatorial ring. There, Varden wounds Acheron with a poisoned blade to make him appear dead, and kills Berard. They then take Acheron out of the city, where he eventually reawakens. =Volume 4= From there, the group finds an old watchtower and enters it, ultimately finding Silvah, a white-haired elf, inside. Silvah explains to them that Kayn'dar had been killed, and that he is living in the watchtower to perfect his magical abilities in order to avenge Kayn'dar. The groups leaves the watchtower, and then Lei'ella explains to the group that because Silvah is a white-haired and golden-eyed elf like her but can still use magic (whereas Lei'ella, like most elves of that variety, have no magical abilities), then \\"Silvah\\" must be Kayn'dar, since before disappearing Kayn'dar had been famous as the only white-haired elf to possess magical powers. They return to the watchtower to confront Silvah, and Lei'ella accuses him of throwing away the only hope for elves such as them. Angered, and worried about his secret getting out, Silvah stabs Lei'ella, and then flees with Raul, the former archmage who is now involved in Silvah's plan. Acheron is able to heal her, however, using Kayn'dar's pendant, which possesses the memories and spirit of Kayn'dar. Once recovered, Lei'ella explains to the group that both she and Kayn'dar are \\"severed elves\\": elves who were born without their connection to nature, and thus are mortal like humans and unable to use magic. Kayn'dar, however, was able to use magic as a child, and thus had been seen as a savior for the severed elves. =Volume 5= The group returns to Aydensfell, the city of mages, and the Archmage explains to them that the kidnapping of Kayn'dar had, in fact, been orchestrated by himself and Raul, as an attempt to learn more about elven healing magic. When the experiment had failed, Raul and \\"Silvah,\\" the personality that inhabited Kayn'dar's body, had left and become recluses. Acheron, Lei'ella, Varden and Neirren decide to go back to the forest of Inverloch and seek aid from the elves. They determine that, if there is a way overcome Silvah and restore Kayn'dar's soul, they will first have to get him away from Raul's influence. In the forest, Lei'ella soon feels the presence of Raul, alone, and Neirren goes out to face him, telling the rest of the group to continue on without her. They go on and find Silvah at the ruins of Inverloch, preparing a spell that will sever all elves from nature. Also at the ruins is Shiara, powerless to stop Silvah. Together, they begin to fight Silvah, hoping to wear him down to the point that he is unable to cast the spell. Meanwhile, Neirren defeats Raul, and before he dies she absorbs his memories and knowledge into herself. She goes to where the others are fighting Silvah, and helps Silvah kill Acheron. When Acheron dies, Silvah suddenly stops fighting, and collapses. When he awakens, he identifies himself as Kayn'dar, and has all of Acheron's memories. He reveals to the others the details of his kidnapping twelve years before: Raul had, as an experiment, caused Kayn'dar's spirit and the spirit of Silvah, a da'kor, to exchange bodies. Kayn'dar's spirit had entered Silvah's body and become Acheron. Silvah, the da'kor whose spirit had taken Kayn'dar's body, desired revenge against the elves who had killed his father, which is why he had ultimately desired to sever all the elves. When he killed Acheron, Silvah's spirit had also died, allowing Kayn'dar's spirit to return to its elven body and thus restoring Kayn'dar. With Silvah and Raul dead, the group retires to the elven city. Varden and Lei'ella eventually leave for Muirfold to start a life together, and Neirren, armed with Raul's knowledge, returns to Aydensfell to pursue her magical studies. Shiara is, at first, angry at Kayn'dar for killing Acheron, for whom she had had strong feelings, but eventually realizes Kayn'dar still is Acheron. TranslationsInverloch has been translated into eight languages: Finnish, French, Polish, Spanish, Arabic, Italian, German and Russian.Inverlock translation into Russian done in comicslate.org Reception In a review of the first Inverloch volume, IGN's A.E.

Pickoff attempt on runner (in red) at first base In baseball, a pickoff is an act by a pitcher, throwing a live ball to a fielder so that the fielder can tag out a baserunner who is either leading off or about to begin stealing the next base. A pickoff attempt occurs when this throw is made in an attempt to make such an out or, more commonly, to \\"keep the runner close\\" by making it clear that the pitcher is aware and concerned with the runner's actions. A catcher may also attempt to throw runners out who likewise \\"stray too far\\" from their bases after a pitch; this can also be called a pickoff attempt. A runner who is picked off is said to have been caught napping, especially if he made no attempt to return to his base. A pickoff move is the motion the pitcher goes through in making this attempt; some pitchers have better pickoff moves than others. Pitchers in professional baseball use the pickoff move often, perhaps several times per game or even per inning if speedy baserunners reach base. Pitchers with more confidence in their ability to eliminate batters directly via strikeouts or flyouts use fewer pickoff attempts. In lower-skilled amateur games, the pickoff move is less common due to the potential for an error if the pitcher throws wild or the fielder fails to make the catch. In youth leagues that don't allow leading off, such as Little League and Cal Ripken League, the need for a pickoff move is eliminated. Technique Arkansas‚Äôs Mark Bolsinger prepares to throw to first base to try to pick off Florida's Avery Barnes in 2009. A pitcher uses many tactics to attempt to disguise whether he is going to begin a pitch or a pickoff attempt. However, some deceptive actions are illegal and may be called a balk. When there is a baserunner, the pitcher will pitch from the stretch, one of the pitching positions. For this example we will say the runner is on first base. From the set position a right-handed pitcher can still see the baserunner out of the corner of his eye. A left-handed pitcher has a clear view of the baserunner because of his position on the pitcher's mound. If it is a right-handed pitcher there is only one main method of this pickoff move. This involves a quick shuffle of the pitcher's feet to turn towards first base and throw the ball to the first baseman. The first baseman will then attempt to tag out the runner. The left-handed pitcher, due to their natural stance and the way they are facing, has multiple moves. The two main methods are called the \\"snap throw\\" and \\"spin move\\". The snap throw is when the pitcher quickly lifts his back foot behind the pitching rubber and slings the ball to the first baseman. A snap throw can also refer to the catcher throwing the ball to the base following a pitch. The spin move is when the pitcher lifts his leg like he is going to pitch the ball but then rotates his body toward first and throws the ball. The pitcher will try to vary this move by doing this move while looking at the runner or at the batter, which can be deceiving to the baserunner. A former pickoff move in Major League Baseball used mostly by right-handed pitchers was called \\"third to first\\" and could only be done if there were baserunners on first and third. It was performed by the pitcher faking a pickoff at third, then stopping, spinning and throwing the ball to first base instead. This move was used to try to get the base-runner or the batter to disclose what action they were going to perform on the pitch. Former Kansas City Royals right-hander, Steve Busby, is credited for popularizing the \\"third to first\\" move, and Jeff Nelson was also known for using it. After the 2012 season, Major League Baseball instituted a rule change defining this move as a balk. Purpose Houston Astros player Jos√© Altuve is tagged out on a pickoff play at first base during a 2017 game There are a few reasons to use this tactic: * To tag out the base-runner. Sometimes the runner will run on the first move of the pitcher. If the pitcher successfully throws the ball to the base before the base-runner is able to return to it, then the defense will be able to tag out the runner. * To prevent a stolen base. If a fast base- runner is leading off the base by a large margin, the pitcher will throw over to the base a few times to try to get the base runner to shorten his lead, thus deterring him from stealing. After enough throws the runner will often either shorten his lead or tire from diving back, preventing him from stealing a base. The runner will often take a few steps off the base in order to have a head start toward the next base. The runner will generally not go too far away from the base so if the pitcher does throw, he can return safely. But the pitcher will hope to catch the runner off-guard. * To extract information from the offense. For example, if the defense suspects a bunting situation, the pitcher may throw over to first in hopes that the batter will square around to bunt on the pitcher's first move, revealing his intention. * To buy time for a relief pitcher to be prepared to come into the game. This is seen quite often in the major leagues, as the pitcher in the game picks multiple times in a row in an effort to waste time so that his replacement can warm up adequately. Holding baserunners Along with having a good, quick pickoff move, a number of other techniques can be used to help cut down on base-runners getting good jumps at stealing bases. First off, changing look patterns keeps the runner off balance and keeps him from timing out the pitcher and guessing when he can take off. An experienced pitcher learns how to mix up his looks and never allow himself to get into a predictable pattern. The most common occurrence of a pitcher falling into a pattern occurs with a runner on second base. It is very easy for a pitcher to repeatedly look just once at the runner and then start the pitching motion as the head turns to pick up home plate again. This makes base-runners have a very easy time at getting a good start at stealing third base. A second method to cut down on giving up stolen bases is to have a quick delivery to the plate. This can be done with a slide step quite easily, however this is not necessary. A slide step tends to make the pitcher not get as much momentum going to the plate, therefore causing the pitch to lose velocity. To counteract this, a pitcher can do a quick leg kick to get momentum going while not taking a long time. The technique to do this is to lift the leg with the knee going up in an inward motion towards the push leg. The entire pitching motion from the first movement until the ball hits the catcher's glove should take around 1.3‚Äì1.5 seconds. By keeping the time under 1.3 seconds, very few runners should be able to steal on even an average-armed catcher. The most important rule to remember while pitching with base-runners on is to stay relaxed. Being tense makes a pitcher much more prone to committing a balk. A baserunner with a reputation for stealing bases, can also take advantage of the pitcher's desire to hold them to their base, as a means to throw off the pitcher's concentration. By taking a large lead, the runner can hope to force the pitcher to make mistakes, therefore helping the batter, by improving their chances at the plate. Prolific base stealers can accomplish this without a true intention to steal any base at all. Pitchers should be aware of this, and take care not to attempt to pick-off a runner, to the point of fatigue or losing focus on the batter. Notable examples On August 24, 1983, Tippy Martinez of the Baltimore Orioles picked off three consecutive Toronto Blue Jays base runners in the first half of the 10th inning. The catcher for the Orioles, utility infielder Lenn Sakata, had replaced the backup catcher at the start of the inning. Sakata hadn't played as a catcher since Little League, and the Blue Jays thought it would be easy to steal off him. In the bottom half of the same inning, Sakata hit a walk-off home run. Game 4 of the 2013 World Series ended with a pickoff, as Koji Uehara of the Boston Red Sox threw to first base, causing St. Louis Cardinals' runner Kolten Wong to be tagged out.

It also significantly extended and simplified the powers of arrest of a constable and introduced restrictions on protests in the vicinity of the Palace of Westminster. It was introduced into the House of Commons on 24 November 2004 and was passed by Parliament and given Royal Assent on 7 April 2005.Introductory text, Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 Measures to introduce a specific offence of \\"incitement to religious hatred\\" were included in early drafts of the Act, but then dropped so the bill would pass before the 2005 general election. The offence has since been created by the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006. Extent of application The Act applies principally to England and Wales but s.179 permits the extent or designates sections applying only to Scotland and/or Northern Ireland; additionally s.179(9) extends the application of four sections (ss.172, 173, 177, 178) beyond the United Kingdom to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. Changes to powers of arrest (England and Wales) The law is displayed in London, with royal guard in the background The Act introduced changes to the powers of arrest utilised by both \\"constables\\" and \\"other persons\\" in England and Wales. The term arrestable offence ceased to have effect as, bar a few preserved exemptions, one power of arrest now applies to all offences when the arrest is made by a constable. Where the threshold of an arrestable offence was previously used to enable specific powers of search or powers to delay certain entitlements, these powers are preserved, but the threshold is changed to that of an indictable offence. Subject to an overriding requirement that an arrest is reasonably required and that no less intrusive way of advancing the investigation is reasonably available (the \\"Necessity Test\\"): the constable may arrest without a warrant anyone who is about to or is in the act of committing an offence, or anyone they have reasonable grounds to suspect of committing or being about to commit an offence. They may also arrest anyone they have reasonable grounds to believe is guilty of an offence they suspect has been committed. These powers to arrest only apply if one or more of the following reasons apply: # To enable the name of the person in question to be ascertained (in the case where the constable does not know, and cannot readily ascertain, the person's name, or has reasonable grounds for doubting whether a name given by the person as his name is his \\"real name\\") # As reason 1 but in respect of the person's address # To prevent the person in question: #* Causing physical injury to themselves or any other person #* Suffering physical injury #* Causing loss of or damage to property #* Committing an offence against public decency (but only where members of the public going about their normal business cannot reasonably be expected to avoid the person in question) #* Causing an unlawful obstruction of the highway # To protect a child or other vulnerable person from the person being arrested # To allow the prompt and effective investigation of the offence or of the conduct of the person being arrested # To prevent any prosecution for the offence from being hindered by the disappearance of the person being arrested Given the scope of the last two provisions, a new Code of Practice was issued for guidance. These changes were enacted on 1 January 2006. Protests near Parliament The Act is controversial primarily for sections 132 to 138, which restrict the right to demonstrate within a \\"designated area\\" of up to one kilometre from any point in Parliament Square.section 138, Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 Demonstrators must give written notice to the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police six days in advance, or if this is not reasonably practicable then no less than 24 hours in advance.section 133, Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 The area itself is defined by a Statutory Instrument, the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (Designated Area) Order 2005, rather than the Act. It specifically excludes Trafalgar Square, a traditional site of protest on the northern boundary of the area. Apart from Parliament it also includes Whitehall, Downing Street, Westminster Abbey, the Middlesex Guildhall, New Scotland Yard, and the Home Office. It also covers a small section of land on the other bank of the River Thames, including County Hall, the Jubilee Gardens, St Thomas' Hospital and the London Eye.Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (Designated Area) Order 2005 These provisions of the Act were introduced partially as a result of Brian Haw and his Parliament Square Peace Campaign. Haw was a peace campaigner, who from 1 June 2001 until his death on 18 June 2011 protested against Britain and the United States' policy towards Iraq. He used placards and a loudspeaker to get his message across, which some British MPs found disruptive. Patrick Cormack MP said in a Parliamentary debate on 7 February 2005 that the lives of \\"members of staff in Portcullis House and 1 Parliament Street, as well as the police who are on duty at Members entrance day after day ... are made intolerable by those people baying away, without a crowd to address, merely repeating themselves ad nauseam.\\"HC 7 February 2005 : Column 1288/1289, Hansard However, others, such as Jeremy Corbyn MP disagreed, saying \\"The Minister should think carefully about removing rights that are enshrined in our history\\", and Glenda Jackson MP agreed with him, saying \\"I regard it as the voice of democracy\\". Lembit √ñpik MP drew attention to the comments of the Prime Minister Tony Blair, who, on 7 April 2002, said: \\"When I pass protestors every day at Downing Street ... I may not like what they call me, but I thank God they can. That's called freedom.\\" The Home Office stated the security concerns, such as the possibility of explosive devices being left in and around Haw's paraphernalia, were another reason for the legislation. The legislation initially appeared ineffective against Mr Haw. The High Court of Justice ruled that as Haw's protest had begun in June 2001 he was not required to get authorisation. The three-strong judicial panel accepted arguments by Mr Haw's lawyers that the law only applied to demonstrations that took place after it came into force, not those previously in progress. However, on 8 May 2006, this decision was overturned by the Court of Appeal. On 1 August 2005, the day that the Act came into force, the Stop the War Coalition and others organised a protest against the prohibition. They did not officially ask for permission, but at the subsequent court cases it was revealed that the Stop the War Coalition had negotiated with police about the protest. The action attracted some 200 people according to reports ‚Äì among them Lauren Booth, Tony Blair's sister-in-law ‚Äì and five people were arrested. The first conviction under the Act was in December 2005, when Maya Evans was convicted for reading the names of British soldiers killed in the Iraq War, near the Cenotaph in October, without police authorisation. In 2006, the comedian and political activist Mark Thomas attacked this section of the act by organising several protests within the area, within the confines of the law. His most notable was when he organised 21 protests over the course of a single day within the area. This act got Thomas into the Guinness Book of Records for taking part in the most protests in a single day. However, as the first and last protest took place in the same location, only 20 protests are recognised by Guinness. In January 2007 Tate Britain opened State Britain, an installation by artist Mark Wallinger that recreated the display confiscated by the police from Brian Haw's protest. The Tate press release on the exhibition mentioned that the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 prohibited \\"unauthorised demonstrations within a one kilometre radius of Parliament Square\\" and that this radius passed through the Duveen Hall, literally bisecting Wallinger's exhibit.\\"State Britain by Mark Wallinger\\" Tate press release, 15 January 2007. Accessed 3 February 2007 Wallinger marked this on the floor with a black line running through the Tate. Press reports dwelt on the potential dangers of this infringement, speculating that the police might even remove the half of the exhibit on the \\"wrong\\" side of the line.Teeman, Tim \\"State Britain\\" The Times, 16 January 2007. Accessed online 3 February 2007 Charles Thomson of the Stuckists art group wrote to The Guardian, pointing out that the exclusion zone ended at Thorney Street, 300 yards before the Tate.Thomson, Charles \\"As we like it\\" The Guardian 19 January 2007. Accessed online 3 February 2007 Gordon Brown said that he planned to look again at this section of the SOCPA, meaning that protesters would eventually be able to protest freely in the kilometre-radius of parliament without prior authorisation being needed. In October 2007, the Home Office published a public consultation document, Managing Protest Around Parliament,Home Office which \\"takes another look at sections 132‚Äì138 [of SOCPA] and explores whether there is another way to address the situation that would both uphold the right to protest while also giving police the powers they need to keep the peace\\". Campaigners are worried that this document contains new threats to freedom of assembly and the right to protest in that is suggests that there could be \\"harmonisation of powers to manage marches and assemblies\\" throughout the UK. Sections 132 to 138 of the Act were repealed by the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, which provides for a different scheme of \\"prohibited activities\\" on Parliament Square. Harassment SOCPA also amended the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 so that \\"pursuing a course of conduct\\" amounting to harassment could mean approaching two people just once, rather than one person at least twice, as before. Commentators such as George Monbiot have voiced the concern that the amended Harassment Act effectively \\"allows the police to ban any campaign they please\\".George Monbiot, The Guardian, 5 February 2009, Why protesters are now stalkers See also Riot Act References External links The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, as amended from the National Archives. * The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, as originally enacted from the National Archives. * Explanatory notes to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. * The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (Designated Sites under Section 128) Order 2007 * Map of the Designated Area * Peace Campaigner Brian Haw's website * Parliament Protest blog monitoring resistance to the restrictions on demonstrations in the vicinity of Parliament * TheyWorkForYou.com - Transcript of Debate in Parliament * Henry Porter, The Guardian, 6 November 2005, \\"A law the Stasi would have loved\\" * Campaign to repeal SOCPA and laws banning unauthorised protest United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 2005 English criminal law Freedom of assembly Law enforcement in England and Wales ","title":"Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005"},{"id":"1838808","text":"Needlefish (family Belonidae) or long toms are piscivorous fishes primarily associated with very shallow marine habitats or the surface of the open sea. Some genera include species found in marine, brackish, and freshwater environments (e.g., Strongylura), while a few genera are confined to freshwater rivers and streams, including Belonion, Potamorrhaphis, and Xenentodon. Needlefish closely resemble North American freshwater gars (family Lepisosteidae) in being elongated and having long, narrow jaws filled with sharp teeth, and some species of needlefishes are referred to as gars or garfish despite being only distantly related to the true gars. In fact, the name \\"garfish\\" was originally used for the needlefish Belone belone in Europe and only later applied to the North American fishes by European settlers during the 18th century. Description Needlefish are slender, ranging from in length. They have a single dorsal fin, placed far back on the body, almost opposite to the anal fin. Their most distinctive feature is their long, narrow beak, which bears multiple sharp teeth. In most species, the upper jaw only reaches its full length in adults, so the juveniles have a half-beak appearance, with an elongated lower jaw, but a much smaller upper one. During this stage of their lifecycle, they eat plankton, switching to fish once the beak fully develops. Needlefish reproduce through mating and lay eggs. The male usually rides the female on the waves as they mate. Needlefish are most common in the subtropics, but some inhabit temperate waters, as well, particularly during the winter. Belone belone, a common North Atlantic species, often swims in schools alongside tuna. recently, some small specimens have been seen in the mediterranean sea. Ecology A hunting needlefish All needlefish feed primarily on smaller fishes. In addition, some species also take krill, swimming crustaceans, and small cephalopods. Saltwater species are also predatory, with the Indian species at least feeding exclusively on large crustaceans. Needlefish have been documented in taking advantage of Snell's Window when attacking prey; leaping at a shallow angle to ambush schools of small fish. Due to light refraction through water, objects at the edges of the window appear distorted, disrupting the image of the leaping needlefish and allowing it to get within very short distances of its prey.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283306854_Ballistic_Beloniformes_attacking_through_Snell%27s_Window Danger to humans A needlefish being cleaned by a cleaner wrasse, Labroides phthirophagus. Needlefish, like all ray-finned beloniforms, are capable of making short jumps out of the water at up to . Since needlefish swim near the surface, they often leap over the decks of shallow boats rather than going around. This jumping activity is greatly excited by artificial light at night; night fisherman and divers in areas across the Pacific Ocean have been \\"attacked\\" by schools of suddenly excited needlefish diving across the water towards the light source at high speed. Their sharp beaks are capable of inflicting deep puncture wounds, often breaking off inside the victim in the process. For many traditional Pacific Islander communities, who primarily fish on reefs from low boats, needlefish represent an even greater risk of injury than sharks.Scott, Susan. \\"Ocean Watch: Those needlefish are not totally harmless after all\\". Honolulu Star-Bulletin. 16 DEC 1996. Occasional deaths and serious injuries have been attributed to needlefish. In 1977, a 10-year- old Hawaiian boy, night fishing with his father at Hanamaulu Bay, Kaua'i, was killed when a needlefish jumped from the water and pierced his eye and brain.\\"A Fatal Brain Injury Caused by a Needlefish\\".

In October 2013, a Saudi Arabian news website also reported the death of a young Saudi man in Dammam who died of hemorrhaging after being hit by a needlefish on the left side of the neck. In 2014, a Russian tourist was nearly killed by a needlefish off Nha Trang in Vietnam. The fish bit her neck and left pieces of its teeth inside her spinal cord, paralyzing her. In early January 2016, a 39-year-old Indonesian woman from Palu, Central Sulawesi, was seriously injured when a half-metre-long needlefish jumped and pierced her just above the right eye. She was swimming in water 80cm deep in Tanjung Karang, a popular recreational spot in the Donggala Regency, Central Sulawesi. She died a few hours later despite efforts to save her at a local hospital. Shortly after, pictures of her injury spread through instant- messaging applications, while several local news websites also reported the incident, some erroneously attributing the attack to a marlin. In December 2018, a needlefish was responsible for the death of a Thai Navy special forces cadet. In the aquarium X-ray of a needlefish Some species of needlefish inhabit brackish and freshwater environments, and one of the freshwater species, Xenentodon cancila from Southeast Asia, is occasionally kept as an aquarium fish. It is a relatively small species, no more than 40 cm in length when fully grown, but is considered to be a rather delicate fish best suited to advanced aquarists.Monks N: Straight to the point: the Beloniformes. Practical Fishkeeping, October 2005 Taxonomy The needlefish family is classified within the order Beloniformes and along with the sauries of the family Scomberesocidae they make up the superfamily Scomberesocoidea and in turn is one of two superfamilies in the suborder Exocoetoidei which comprises all of the Beloniformes except for the ricefishes of the family Adrianichthydae. Workers have concluded that the genus Belone is the sister group to the sauries and that if this is correct them the Belonidae is only monophyletic if the sauries are included within it.

It is a particularly fascinating species for ecological and evolutionary research, as evidenced by its shifting taxonomic classifications. Conflicting observations of host plants utilized, distinctive morphologies, and a wide range of occupied habitats have prompted investigation into several potential subspecies. To date, two genetic studies have been done on A. mormo, with analysis revealing that disjunct populations are genetically and phenotypically distinct. These studies support a potential need for refined taxonomies, although a larger body of data is required to make clear decisions. Populations of A. mormo are widely distributed throughout western North America, with peripheral colonies located in Canada and Mexico. The Canadian populations have historically lacked scientific study, prompting a series of investigations in the past decade. A. mormo is the only representative of the family Riodinidae, a primarily Neotropic family consisting of roughly 1500 species, that lives in Canada. Three populations of A. mormo have been given conservation statuses: the Saskatchewan population is listed as threatened, while both the British Columbia and Comstock Lange populations are classified as endangered. Conservation efforts are complicated by a dependency on human activity for habitat success. Soil disturbances, caused by human and railway traffic, are critical for the survival of host plants and subsequent A. mormo populations; however, overbearing human presence can lead to habitat destruction. Conservation statuses have been repeatedly defended by research, and recovery strategies developed in response.  Geographic range  Apodemia mormo constitutes the widest ranging North American species of the family Riodinidae. Populations of A. mormo span western North America, ranging from Sinola, Mexico to Southwestern Canada, and are found west of North Dakota primarily in California, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and Washington. While there are several populations recognized in the US, only two are present in Canada: the British Columbia population, along the Similkameen River Valley, and the Saskatchewan population, in the Grasslands National Park. The Canadian populations are listed with conservation statuses of ‚Äúendangered‚Äù and ‚Äúthreatened‚Äù, respectively. Rather than a continuous distribution, A. mormo colonies occur in semi-isolated patches. Population studies have found that small amounts of geographic distance between colonies (15‚Äì20 km) are significant to hinder gene flow, and render populations phenotypically distinct. Thus, there is great within species variation depending on geographic location, and taxonomic distinctions are still in flux.  Habitat  Populations of Apodemia mormo primarily occupy dry, arid habitats that support a high density of their larval host plant: various species of buckwheat (Eriogonum). Since A. mormo is singularly dependent on Eriogonum during the larval stage, its presence is the most stable predictor of habitat. Dunes, sloping hillsides, grasslands and gravelly deserts have all been observed as viable environments for A. mormo habitats, indicating the species‚Äô broad adaptability. Wick investigated microhabitat characteristics associated with A. mormo inhabitance, and found ‚Äúhost plant habitat[s] with lower elevation, a southerly to southwesterly aspect, lower available soil nitrogen, a steeper slope, higher % bare ground, and higher soil pH‚Äù were most often correlated with presence of A. mormo. The exact variety of buckwheat which functions as the larval host plant changes with the population being studied. E. paucifllorum, commonly known as the branched umbrella plant, is closely associated with the Saskatchewan population. In British Columbia, Eriogonum niveum functions as the larval host plant, while in the population of A. m. langei, Eriogonum nudum serves as the primary host and food source. A. mormo colonies have additionally been correlated with the presence of several other plants. In the Saskatchewan population, presence of Ericamerica nauseosa (rabbitbrush) is a good predictor of A. mormo presence, and functions as a secondary nectar source. Furthermore, Wick investigated the possibility of complex dependencies with other observed habitat plants, including ‚Äúcreeping juniper, yellow umbrella plant, saltbush, prickly pear cactus, Colorado rubberweed, yellow sweet clover, wild rose and sage‚Äù. Some level of human interaction with A. mormo habitats is thought to be crucial for their success. In the Canadian populations, specifically, human railway traffic through habitat corridors provides frequent disturbances to the soil, nurturing the growth of their larval host plant. To similar effect, steep and unstable slopes prone to frequent erosion provide appropriate conditions for host plant prosperity. A. mormo are rarely found on undisturbed flats.  Food resources  = Caterpillars = Adult A. mormo feeding on nectar in California In general, species of Eriogonum serve as larval host plants for A. mormo. In the Saskatchewan population, Eriogonum niveum, or snow buckwheat, functions as the primary host plant and food resource. In the British Columbia population, the branched umbrella plant Eriogonum pauciflorum solely fulfills this role. These species flourish with adequate soil disturbances, thus only those on rocky hillsides tend to bloom and attract A. mormo. = Adults = Eriogonum pauciflorum doubles as the primary nectar source for adult Mormon Metalmarks; however, rabbitbrush (Ericameria nauseosus) is often used as a secondary nectar source. A. mormo preferentially visit branched umbrella plants, and have only been observed visiting rabbitbrush once Eriogonum pauciflorum flowers are in decay.  Oviposition  Differing observations have been made regarding the oviposition behavior of Apodemia mormo. In California, Powell reports A. m. langei ovipositing on deteriorating, lower leaves of the Eriogonum, typically in groups of 2-4 eggs. However, in the Canadian populations, Wick observes entirely different behavior. The specimens of A. mormo were seen laying eggs near their host plants, but not directly on the leaves. Instead, females oviposited a single egg in rocky crevices or soil cracks. This occurred in the afternoon, with a duration of up to 30 seconds.Wick, Ashley Anne, et al. \\"First observations of Mormon Metalmark (Apodemia mormo) oviposition behaviour in Canada.\\" The Canadian Field- Naturalist 126.1 (2012): 34-37. Temperature differentials between Southern California and Canada may help to explain these observed differences. Since exposure to sunlight supports increased survival in cold habitats, laying eggs on exposed rocky surfaces could be an adaptive advantage in the Canadian populations.Bonebrake, T. C., C. L. Boggs, J. M. McNally, J. Ranganathan, and P. R. Ehrlich. 2010. Oviposition behaviour and offspring performance in herbivorous insects: consequences of climatic and habitat heterogeneity. Oikos 119: 927-934.Bryant, S. R., C. D. Thomas, and J. S. Bale. 2002. The influence of thermal ecology on the distribution of three nym phalid butterflies. Journal of Applied Ecology 39: 43-55. Regardless, these populations still require ovipositing nearby suitably mature host plants, since the larvae will require adequate protection and nutrients once hatched.  Life cycle  = Egg = Eggs are laid by adult females in clusters ranging from 1-4, depending on the specific population being observed. In Canadian populations, Scott reported the eggs as resembling ‚Äúflattened spheres‚Äù, and described their color as ‚Äúpink turning purple‚Äù.Scott, J.A. 1986. The butterflies of North America: A natural history and field guide. Stanford University Press, Stanford. 581 pp. In contrast, Wick observed ‚Äúamber coloured‚Äù eggs the size of a ‚Äúpinhead‚Äù in the Saskatchewan population. Egg development is potentially dependent on habitat choice, temperature, and exposure to solar radiation; further studies are needed in regards to A. mormo. = Caterpillar = Larvae emerge from eggs during the winter, and are thought to remain at a single host plant during this stage of their lives. Early instar larvae hibernate following their eclosion. From June to July, the late instar larvae feed nocturnally on the leaves of their host plants, which are various species of buckwheat, depending on the population under study. During the day, larvae can be found resting in nests made of leaf debris and silk at the base of the plant. = Pupa = Pupation takes place by between July and August, with ‚Äúhairy‚Ä¶mottled brown‚Äù pupas congregated in leaf litter underneath the host plant. = Adult = Adult emergence occurs spread out over the course of a month, with males preceding females by a few days. These mature butterflies live between nine and twelve days, with females having a slightly longer lifespan than males. During this time, A. mormo prefer to stay near to their host plant, travelling short distances of up to 50 m. Again, there is a slight distinction between sexes, with females tending to fly farther than males. Both males and females forage for nectar. = Reproduction = Mating occurs approximately three days into the adult lifespan. Females seek out male partners, who wait on food plants for their arrival. It has been postulated that females of the subspecies Langei mate multiply, because of an observed ratio of 2.6 spermatophores per female.Arnold, R.A. and J.A. Powell 1983. Apodemia mormo langei. Ch. 6 in Ecological studies of six endangered butterflies (Lepidoptera, Lycaenidae): Island biogeography, patch dynamics and design of habitat preserves. Univ. Cal. Publ. Entomol. 99:1-161.  Enemies  = Parasites = Trichogramma kaykai, a small parasitic wasp, parasitize Apodemia mormo deserti, primarily located in the Mojave Desert. These wasps lay clutches of 3-5 offspring in each Apodemia mormo deserti egg.  Genetics  = Population genetics = The proper taxonomic classifications for Apodemia mormo are still under debate. Because the species tends to occur in small, isolated populations, the relatedness between populations is frequently questioned. A population genetics study conducted by Proshek revealed that the British Columbia and Saskatchewan populations of A. mormo in Canada are genetically distinct; furthermore, they uncovered higher genetic diversity in eastern vs. western populations, emphasizing low diversity in the British Columbia population. A second genetic study using AFLPs supports low genetic diversity in the British Columbia population, and reports high spatial genetic structure and limited gene flow between populations. Furthermore, they found genetic similarities between the Saskatchewan population and more eastern populations. The combined results of these two studies indicate potentials for current migration activities, as well as high genetic drift. In addition to genetic evidence, morphological and behavioral data are required to make firm taxonomic distinctions; however, genetic investigation has begun to reveal some of the challenges of classification. = Subspecies = There are at least twenty named subspecies of A. mormo. Below is a partial list of recognized subspecies: # A. m. langei # A. m. puebloScott, J. A. and M. S. Fisher 1998. New Western North American butterflies. Papilio (New Series) 11:1-12. # A. m. mejicanus # A. m. nigrescensT. Emmel, ed., Systematics of Western North American Butterflies, (1998), pp. 796-8 # A. m. arenariaSystematics, pp. 806-7 # A. m. prattiSystematics, pp. 795-6  Physiology  A. mormo populations exhibit significant morphological variation, and therefore no singular description is a perfect fit for the species.POWELL, J.A. 1975. Riodinidae. The Metalmarks. pp. 259‚Äì272. In: Howe, W.H. (Ed.). The Butterflies of North America. Doubleday; Garden City, New York. In general, the butterfly has a wingspan of 25‚Äì35 mm, with males being slightly smaller than females. Females are further differentiated from males by their number of functional legs; females possess three pairs, while males do not utilize their shortened forelegs and thus only have two. The Canadian populations have been described as having white checked dark brown wings, a gray body, green eyes, and black and white banded antennae. There is a reddish tint towards the base of the forewings, and the ventral side of the wings are gray. = Flight = Both the Canadian populations and the endangered A. m. langei are univoltine, meaning they have one generation annually. Following emergence, A. mormo adults have a flight period of roughly thirty days, with specific timing ranging from mid-July into September.Guppy, C.S., J.H. Shepard and N.G. Kondla. 1994. Butterflies and skippers of conservation concern in British Columbia. Canadian Field-Naturalist 108:31-40. They reach their highest concentration two weeks after the first adult emerges, usually during August. Adults do not fly long distances, and display mostly sedentary behaviors. The primary purposes for flight include foraging for nectar on nearby plants, and seeking out mates. Their flight pattern can be characterized as short, linear and fast.  Conservation  = Status = Low genetic diversity, small, distinctive populations, semi-isolated geographic distribution, and habitat dependence all predispose A. mormo to risk of extinction and warrant conservation efforts. In particular, Canadian populations are perceived as especially vulnerable to stochastic events, such as natural disasters, climate change, and outbreaks of disease. Conservation efforts have been in effect for the Canadian populations since the early 2000s under COSEWIC, and for A. m. langei since 1976 under the US Federal Endangered Species Act. = Habitat loss = A key concern for conservationists is potential habitat loss. Urban development, agricultural expansion, ranching practices, and campground activities may be responsible for disturbing natural habitats and breaking them up into small patches. While efforts to prevent such fragmentation are encouraged, Crawford emphasizes a need to conserve even small habitat zones, which may function as bridges between sub- populations.Pruss, S. D., et al. \\"Recovery strategy for the Mormon Metalmark (Apodemia mormo) Prairie population.\\" Canada species at risk act. Recovery strategy series, parks Canada agency, Ottawa(2008). Furthermore, habitat loss might result from invasive, competitive plant species. A. mormo populations would severely suffer if these intruders successfully outcompete local Eriogonum species, given their dependency on the host plant.Keeler, M. S., F. S. C. Chew, B. C. Goodale and J. M. Reed. 2006. Modelling the impacts of two exotic invasive species on a native butterfly: top-down vs. bottom-up effects. Journal of Animal Ecology 75: 777-788. Finally, Eriogonum plants go into senescence after 10‚Äì15 years. This poses a significant problem for habitat maintenance, and suggests a need for regular dispersal of new Eriogonum plants as part of conservation efforts. = Recovery strategies = Recovery strategies are consistently developed and updated as new research emerges. Regarding the Lange population in California, efforts to clear weedy vegetation and recreate mounds of sand and soil were started in 1991. Eriogonum species were seeded through the habitats and the land was completely fenced in, preventing destructive human presence. With respect to the Canadian populations, Crawford suggests the development of strategies which recover habitat patches, regardless of size, and encourage gene flow between isolated populations.

The first people to live in the area were indigenous tribes that still remain; they were followed by the Malays, who moved there from mainland Asia in ancient times. Chinese and Indian cultural influences made their mark when trade began with those countries, and increased with immigration to Malaysia. Other cultures that heavily influenced that of Malaysia include Persian, Arabic, British. The many different ethnicities that currently exist in Malaysia have their own unique and distinctive cultural identities, with some crossover. Arts and music have a long tradition in Malaysia, with Malay art dating back to the Malay sultanates. Traditional art was centred on fields such as carving, silversmithing, and weaving. Islamic taboos restricted artwork depicting humans until the mid-20th century. Performing arts and shadow puppet shows are popular, and often show Indian influences. Various influences can be seen in architecture, from individual cultures in Malaysia and from other countries. Large modern structures have been built, including the tallest twin buildings in the world, the Petronas Twin Towers. Malaysian music has a variety of origins, and is largely based around percussion instruments. Much early Malaysian literature was based on Indian epics, which remained unchanged even as Malays converted to Islam; this has expanded in recent decades. English literature remained restricted to the higher class until the arrival of the printing press. Locally created Chinese and Indian literature appeared in the 19th century. Cuisine is often divided along ethnic lines, but some dishes exist which have mixed foods from different ethnicities. Each major religious group has its major holy days declared as official holidays. Official holidays differ by state; the most widespread one is Merdeka day which celebrates the independence of Malaya. Although festivals often stem from a specific ethnic background, they are celebrated by all people in Malaysia. Traditional sports are popular in Malaysia, while it has become a powerhouse in international sports such as badminton. Malaysia hosted the Commonwealth Games in 1998, the first Commonwealth Games where the torch passed through more countries than England and the host. The Malaysian government has taken the step of defining Malaysian Culture through the \\"1971 National Culture Policy\\", which defined what was considered official culture, basing it around Malay culture and integrating Islamic influences. This especially affected language; only Malay texts are considered official cultural texts. Government control over the media is strong, and most media outlets are related to the government in some way. Background Peninsular Malaysia (left) is 40% of Malaysia's territory, and is predominately Islamic. The two states of East Malaysia are mostly Christian. The capital of Malaysia is Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia consists of two distinct geographical regions: Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia. Malaysia was formed when the Federation of Malaya merged with North Borneo (today the province of Sabah), Sarawak, and Singapore (seceded 1965) in 1963, and cultural differences between Peninsular and East Malaysia remain. During the formation of Malaysia, executive power was vested in the Perikatan (later the Barisan Nasional) coalition of three racially based political parties, namely the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), and Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC). UMNO has dominated the coalition from its inception. Although Islam is the official state religion, the Constitution of Malaysia guarantees freedom of religion. =Ethnic groups= Malaysia is a multi‚Äìethnic, multicultural, and multilingual society, and the many ethnic groups in Malaysia maintain separate cultural identities. The society of Malaysia has been described as \\"Asia in miniature\\". The original culture of the area stemmed from its indigenous tribes, along with the Malays who moved there in ancient times. Substantial influence exists from the Chinese and Indian cultures, dating back to when trade with those countries began in the area. Other cultures that heavily influenced that of Malaysia include Persian, Arabic, and British. The structure of the government, along with the racial balance of power caused by the idea of a social contract, has resulted in little incentive for the cultural assimilation of ethnic minorities in Malaya and Malaysia. The government has historically made little distinction between \\"Malay culture\\" and \\"Malaysian culture\\". The Malays, who account for over half the Malaysian population, play a dominant role politically and are included in a grouping identified as bumiputra. Their native language, Bahasa Malaysia, is the national language of the country.Article 152. Constitution of Malaysia. By definition of the Malaysian constitution, all Malays are Muslims. The Orang Asal, the earliest inhabitants of Malaya, formed only 0.5 percent of the total population in Malaysia in 2000, but represented a majority in East Malaysia, Borneo. In Sarawak and Sabah, most of the non-Muslim indigenous groups are classified as Dayaks, and they constitute about 40 percent of the population in the state. Many tribes have converted to Christianity. The 140,000 Orang Asli, or aboriginal peoples, comprise a number of different ethnic communities living in peninsular Malaysia. Heads from old headhunting practices in a Kadazan house in Sabah The Chinese have been settling in Malaysia for many centuries, and form the second-largest ethnic group. The first Chinese to settle in the Straits Settlements, primarily in and around Malacca, gradually adopted elements of Malaysian culture and intermarried with the Malaysian community and with this, a new ethnic group called emerged, the Peranakan (\\"Straits Chinese\\"). These Chinese have adopted Malay traditions while maintaining elements of Chinese culture such as their largely Buddhist and Taoist religion. The more common Chinese varieties spoken in Peninsular Malaysia are Cantonese, Mandarin, Hokkien, Hakka, Hainanese, and Fuzhou. The Indian community in Malaysia is the smallest of the three main ethnic groups, accounting for about 10 percent of the country's population. They speak a variety of South Asian languages. Tamils, Malayalees, and Telugu people make up over 85 percent of the people of Indian origin in the country. Indian immigrants to Malaysia brought with them the Hindu and Sikh cultures. This included temples and Gurdwaras, cuisine, and clothing. Hindu tradition remains strong in the Indian community of Malaysia. A community of Indians who have adopted Malay cultural practices also exists in Malacca. Though they remain Hindu, the Chitties speak Bahasa Malaysia and dress and act as Malays. Some Eurasians of mixed European and Malay descent live in Malaysia. A small community in Malacca are descendants of former Portuguese colonists who married Malay women. While they have adopted Malay culture, they speak their own language and are Catholics. Each ethnic group has its own underlying culture that separates it from the others, and they have achieved different levels of integration. The Chinese have integrated with Malay culture in a number of areas, including parts of Terengganu, and they form Malayanised groups such as the Baba Chinese in Malacca and the Sino- Kadazan of Sabah. Their years under combined British rule brought some joint sense of identity to all the ethnic groups, with English ideas and ideals providing some unifying features. A joint Malaysian culture can be seen in the symbiosis of the cultures of the people within it. =Policies and controversies= The Malaysian government defined Malaysian culture through the issuance of the \\"1971 National Culture Policy\\". It defines three principles as guidelines for Malaysian culture: that it is based on the cultures of indigenous people; that if elements from other cultures are judged suitable and reasonable they may be considered Malaysian culture; and that Islam will be an important part of national culture. Some cultural disputes exist between Malaysia and neighbouring Indonesia. The two countries share a similar cultural heritage, sharing many traditions and items. However, disputes have arisen over things ranging from culinary dishes to Malaysia's national anthem. Strong feelings exist in Indonesia about protecting that nation's national heritage. The rivalry between the two countries began during Konfrontasi just after Malaysian independence, when Indonesia and Malaysia were almost at war. Building resentment since then coupled with the economic success of Malaysia mean these feelings are still strong in Indonesia today. The Malaysian government and the Indonesian government have met to defuse some of the tensions resulting from the overlaps in culture. Feelings are not as strong in Malaysia, where most recognise that many cultural values are shared. Comparison of Malay language, Jawi writing, and Khat Calligraphy with other Languages One dispute, known as the Pendet controversy, began when Indonesians claimed the Pendet Dance was used in an official Malaysian tourism ad campaign, causing official protests. This dance, from Bali in Indonesia, was used only in a Discovery Channel ad, not an ad sponsored by the Malaysian government. Songs, such as the Rasa Sayange song, have caused similar controversies. The Malaysian national anthem, Negaraku, was claimed to be based on a similar Indonesian song written a year earlier. Both tunes are derived from a 19th century French song, which caused the similarity. In 2019, plans by the Ministry of Education to introduce of khat (Jawi calligraphy) in the Year 4 Bahasa Melayu syllabus in vernacular schools in the following year became a polemical issue. Certain parties saw the issue as symptoms of creeping Islamisation while others saw it as beneficial towards the appreciation of a cultural heritage. Arts Joget Melayu, a Malay dance Malacca Art Gallery Traditional Malaysian art is mainly centred on the crafts of carving, weaving, and silversmithing. Traditional art ranges from handwoven baskets from rural areas to the silverwork of the Malay courts. Common artworks included ornamental kris and beetle nut sets. Luxurious textiles known as Songket are made, as well as traditional patterned batik fabrics. Indigenous East Malaysians are known for their wooden masks. Malaysian art has expanded only recently, as before the 1950s Islamic taboos about drawing people and animals were strong. Textiles such as the batik, songket, Pua Kumbu, and tekat are used for decorations, often embroidered with a painting or pattern. Traditional jewelry was made from gold and silver adorned with gems, and, in East Malaysia, leather and beads were used to the same effect. Earthenware has been developed in many areas. The Labu Sayong is a gourd- shaped clay jar that holds water. Perak is famous for these. Also used to store water is the angular Terenang. The belanga is a clay bowl used to cook, with a wide base that allows heat to spread easily. Carved wood is used as ornamentation for many items, such as doors and window panels. Woodcarving was never an industry, but an art. Traditional woodcarvers spent years simply preparing the wood, due to a belief that woodcarvers need to be a perfect match with their wood. The wood also had to match the buyer, so woodcarving was a very ritualised task. Each ethnic group has distinct performing arts, with little overlap between them. Malay art shows some North Indian influence. A form of art called mak yong, incorporating dance and drama, remains strong in the Kelantan state. However, older Malayan-Thai performing arts such as mak yong have declined in popularity throughout the country due to their Hindu- Buddhist origin. Since the Islamisation period, the arts and tourism ministry have focused on newer dances of Portuguese, Middle Eastern, or Mughal origin. Malay traditional dances include joget melayu and zapin. In recent years, dikir barat has grown in popularity, and it is actively promoted by state governments as a cultural icon. Silat is another popular Malay martial art and dance form, believed to increase a person's spiritual strength. Wayang kulit (shadow puppet theatre) has been popular in Malaysia for centuries. The puppets are usually made with cow and buffalo skin, and are carved and painted by hand. Plays done with shadow puppets are often based on traditional stories, especially tales from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Traditionally, theatrical music is performed only by men. Javanese immigrants brought Kuda Kepang to Johor, and is a form of dance where dancers sit on mock horses and tells the tales of Islamic wars. The Chinese communities brought traditional lion dances and dragon dances with them, while Indians brought art forms such as Bharata Natyam and Bhangra. Colonialism also brought other art forms, such as the Portuguese Farapeira and Branyo. There are a variety of traditional dances, which often have very strong spiritual significance. Different tribes from west and east Malaysia have different dances. Architecture Replica of the palace of the Malacca Sultanate, built from information in the Malay Annals South-East Asia's Largest Temple- Kek Lok Si in Penang being illuminated in preparation for the Lunar New Year. Architecture in Malaysia is a combination of many styles, from Islamic and Chinese styles to those brought by European colonists. Malay architecture has changed due to these influences. Houses in the north are similar to those in Thailand, while those in the south are similar to those in Java. New materials, such as glasses and nails, were brought in by Europeans, changing the architecture. Houses are built for tropical conditions, raised on stilts with high roofs and large windows, allowing air to flow through the house and cool it down. Wood has been the main building material for much of Malaysia's history; it is used for everything from the simple kampung to royal palaces. In Negeri Sembilan traditional houses are entirely free of nails. Besides wood, other common materials such as bamboo and leaves were used. The Istana Kenangan in Kuala Kangsar was built in 1926, and it the only Malay palace with bamboo walls. The Oral Asal of East Malaysia live in longhouses and water villages. Longhouses are elevated and on stilts, and can house 20 to 100 families. Water villages are also built on stilts, with houses connected with planks and most transport by boats. Chinese architecture can be divided into two types, traditional and Baba Nyonya. Baba Nyonya households are made of colourful tiles and have large indoor courtyards. Indian architecture came with the Malaysian Indians, reflecting the architecture of southern India where most originated from. Some Sikh architecture was also imported. Malacca, which was a traditional centre of trade, has a large variety of building styles. Large wooden structures such as the Palace of Sultan Mansur Shah exist from early periods. Chinese influence can be seen in brightly decorated temples and terraced shop houses. The largest remaining Portuguese structure in Malacca is the A Famosa fort. Other colonial building include the Dutch Stadthuys, the Dutch Colonial town brick buildings, and buildings built by the British such as the Memorial Hall, which combines Baroque and Islamic architecture. The shapes and sizes of houses differ from state to state. Common elements in Peninsular Malaysia include pitched roofs, verandahs, and high ceilings, raised on stilts for ventilation. The woodwork in the house is often intricately carved. The floors are at different levels depending on the function of the room. Mosques have traditionally been based on Javanese architecture. In modern times, the government has promoted different projects, from the tallest twin buildings in the world, the Petronas Twin Towers, to a whole garden city, Putrajaya. Malaysian firms are developing skyscraper designs that are specifically for tropical climates. Music Traditional Malay music and performing arts appear to have originated in the Kelantan- Pattani region. The music is based around percussion instruments, the most important of which is the gendang (drum). There are at least 14 types of traditional drums. Drums and other traditional percussion instruments are often made from natural materials such as shells. Other instruments include the rebab (a bowed string instrument), the serunai (a double-reed oboe-like instrument), the seruling (flute), and trumpets. Music is traditionally used for storytelling, celebrating life-cycle events, and at annual events such as the harvest. Music was once used as a form of long-distance communication. Traditional orchestra can be divided between two forms, the gamelan which plays melodies using gongs and string instruments, and the nobat which uses wind instruments to create more solemn music. In East Malaysia, ensembles based around gongs such as agung and kulintang are commonly used in ceremonies such as funerals and weddings. These ensembles are also common in the southern Philippines, Kalimantan in Indonesia, and in Brunei. Chinese and Indian Malaysians have their own forms of music, and the indigenous tribes of Peninsula and East Malaysia have unique traditional instruments. In countries such as Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia it is believed that performing at the house during Hari Raya (a traditional malay festival) is a good belief as it brings goodluck and fortune to the performers and host of the house. Within Malaysia, the largest performing arts venue is the Petronas Philharmonic Hall. The resident orchestra is the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra. Malay popular music is a combination of styles from all ethnicities in the country. The Malaysian government has taken steps to control what music is available in Malaysia; rap music has been criticised, heavy metal has been limited, and foreign bands must submit a recording of a recent concert before playing in Malaysia. It is believed that this music is a bad influence on youth. Literature Malacca Literature Museum The strong oral tradition that has existed since before the arrival of writing to what is now Malaysia continues today. These early works were heavily influenced by Indian epics. Oral literature such as folktales flourished even after printed works appeared. The Arabic Jawi script arrived with the coming of Islam to the peninsula in the late 15th century. At this point, stories which previously had given lessons in Hinduism and Buddhism were taken to have more universal meanings, with their main story lines remaining intact. Each of the Malay Sultanates created their own literary tradition influenced by preexisting oral stories and by the stories that came with Islam. The arrival of the printing press in Malaysia was key in allowing literature to be accessed by more than those rich enough to afford handwritten manuscripts. There was a division between the royal Malays, who knew English, and the lower classes, who only read Malay. In the early years of the 20th century, literature began to change to reflect the changing norms of Malaysians. In 1971 the government took the step of defining the literature of different languages. Literature written in Malay was called \\"The National Literature of Malaysia\\"; literature in other bumiputra languages was called \\"regional literature\\"; literature in other languages was called \\"sectional literature\\". Malay poetry is highly developed, and uses many forms. A Hikayat is a traditional narrative, and stories written in that fashion are named using Hikayat followed by the name(s) of the protagonist(s). The pantun is a form of poetry used in many aspects of Malay culture. The Syair is another form of narrative, once very popular. The Hikayat form remains popular, and the pantun has spread from Malay to other languages. Until the 19th century, literature produced in Malaysia focused mainly on tales of royalty, as it was produced just for royalty. It was after this point that it expanded to other areas. The race riots of 1969 strongly influenced literature; the improvements of the economy in the 1980s brought about social changes and new forms of literature. The first Malay literature was in Arabic script. The earliest known Malay writing is on the Terengganu Inscription Stone, made in 1303. One of the more famous Malay works is the Sulalatus al- Salatin, also known as the Sejarah Melayu (meaning \\"The Malay Annals\\"). It was originally recorded in the 15th century, although it has since been edited; the known version is from the 16th century. The Hikaya Rajit Pasai, written in the 15th century, is another significant literary work. The Hikayat Hang Tuah, or story of Hang Tuah, tells the story of Hang Tuah and his devotion to his Sultan. This is the most famous Hikayat; it drew from the Sejarah Melayu. Both have been nominated as world heritage items under the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 'Memory of the World' programme. Folktales such as the Hikayat Sang Kancil, about a clever mouse deer, are popular, as are adventures such as Ramayana, adapted from Indian epics. Munshi Abdullah (Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir), who lived from 1797 to 1854, is regarded as the father of Malay literature. Hikayat Abdullah, his autobiography, is about everyday life at the time when British influence was spreading. Female Malay writers began becoming popular in the 1950s. Different ethnic and linguistic groups have produced works in their own languages. Chinese and Indian literature became common as the numbers of speakers increased in Malaysia, and locally produced works based in languages from those areas began to be produced in the 19th century. Beginning in the 1950s, Chinese literature expanded; homemade literature in Indian languages has failed to emerge. English has become a common literary language. Cuisine Nasi Lemak, the national dish of Malaysia Clockwise from bottom left: beef soup, ketupat (compressed rice cubes), beef rendang and sayur lodeh Malaysia's cuisine reflects the multiethnic makeup of its population, and is defined by its diversity. Many cultures from Malaysia and the surrounding areas have greatly influenced Malaysian cuisine, with strong influence from Malay, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Javanese, and Sumatran cuisines. Much of this is due to Malaysia being a part of the ancient spice route. The cuisine is very similar to that of Singapore and Brunei, and also bears resemblance to Filipino cuisine. The different states of Malaysia have varied dishes, and often the food in Malaysia is different from the original dishes. Sometimes food not found in its original culture is assimilated into another; for example, Chinese restaurants in Malaysia often serve Malaysian dishes. Food from one culture is sometimes cooked using styles taken from another. This means that although many Malaysian dishes originate from another culture, they have their own identities. Often the food in Malaysia is different from the original dishes; for example, Chinese food is often sweeter in Malaysian versions than the original. The Peranakans, Chinese who moved to Malaysia centuries ago, have their own unique cuisine that Chinese cooking techniques with Malay ingredients. During a dinner food is not served in courses, but all at once. Rice is popular in many Malaysian dishes. Chilli is commonly found in Malaysian dishes, although this does not make them spicy. Noodles are common. Pork is rarely used in Malaysia, because of the large Muslim population. Some celebrations have food associated with them, and mooncakes are often eaten during Mooncake Festival. Clothing Siti Nurhaliza wearing a tudung As of 2013 most Muslim Malaysian women wear the tudung, a type of hijab. This use of the tudung was uncommon prior to the 1979 Iranian revolution,Boo, Su-lyn. \\"Tudung industry in Malaysia: Cashing in on conservative Islam\\" (Archive). The Malay Mail. May 9, 2015.

Several members of the Kelantan ulama in the 1960s believed the hijab was not mandatory. By 2015 the Malaysian ulama believed this previous viewpoint was un-Islamic.Fernandez, Celine. \\"Why Some Women Wear a Hijab and Some Don‚Äôt\\" (Archive). The Wall Street Journal. April 18, 2011.

Norhayati Kaprawi directed a 2011 documentary about the use of tudung in Malaysia, \\"Siapa Aku?\\" (\\"Who am I?\\"). It is in Malay, with English subtitles available. Holidays Hari raya Malaysians observe a number of holidays and festivities throughout the year, on both the federal and state level. Other festivals are observed by particular ethnic or religion groups, but are not public holidays. The main holy days of each major religion are public holidays. The most widespread holiday is the \\"Hari Merdeka\\" (Independence Day), otherwise known as \\"Merdeka\\" (Freedom), on 31 August. It commemorates the independence of the Federation of Malaya. This, as well as Labour Day (1 May), the King's birthday (first Saturday of June), and some other festivals are major national public holidays. Federal Territory day is celebrated in the three Federal territories (on 1st February). Malaysia Day, held on 16 September, commemorates the formation of Malaysia through the union of Malaya, Singapore, Sabah, and Sarawak, although it is celebrated mainly in East Malaysia. New Year's Day, Chinese New Year, and the start of the Islamic calendar are all public holidays. Muslim holidays are highly prominent in Malaysia. The most important of these is Hari Raya Puasa (also called Hari Raya Aidilfitri), which is the Malay translation of Eid al-Fitr. It is a festival honoured by Muslims worldwide marking the end of Ramadan, the fasting month. They also celebrate Hari Raya Haji (also called Hari Raya Aidiladha, the translation of Eid ul-Adha), Awal Muharram (Islamic New Year) and Maulidur Rasul (Birthday of the Prophet). Malaysian Chinese typically hold the same festivals observed by Chinese around the world. Chinese New Year is the most prominent, lasting for 15 days. Hindus in Malaysia celebrate Deepavali, the festival of light, while Thaipusam is a celebration in which pilgrims from all over the country meet at the Batu Caves. Wesak (Malay for Vesak), the day of Buddha's birth, is a public holiday. Malaysia's Christian community observes most of the holidays observed by Christians elsewhere, most notably Christmas and Easter. Good Friday, however, is only a public holiday in the two Bornean states. The harvest festivals of Gawai in Sarawak and Kaamatan in Sabah are also important for East Malaysians. Despite most of the festivals being identified with a particular ethnic or religious group, festivities are often participated in by all Malaysians. One example of this is the celebration of Kongsi Raya, which is celebrated when Hari Raya Puasa and Chinese New Year coincide. The term Kongsi Raya (which means \\"sharing the celebration\\" in Malay) was coined because of the similarity between the word kongsi and the Chinese New Year greeting of Gong xi fa cai. Similarly, the portmanteau Deepa Raya was coined when Hari Raya Puasa and Deepavali coincided. A practice known as \\"open house\\" (rumah terbuka) is common during the festivities, especially during Hari Raya Aidilfitri, Deepavali, Chinese New Year, and Christmas. Open house means that all well-wishers are received and that everyone, regardless of background, is invited to attend. Open houses are normally held at the home of the host and foods are prepared by the host. There are also open houses held at larger public venues, especially when hosted by government agencies or corporations. Most Malaysians take the time off work or school to return to their hometowns to celebrate the festivities with their extended relatives. This practice is commonly known as balik kampung and usually causes traffic jams on most highways in the country. Sports wau workshop Popular sports in Malaysia include badminton, bowling, football, squash, and field hockey. Malaysia has small-scale traditional sports. Wau is a traditional form of kite-flying involving kites created with intricate designs. These kites can reach heights of nearly , and due to bamboo attachments create a humming sound when flown. Sepak takraw is a game in which a rattan ball is kept in the air without using hands. A traditional game played during the rice harvest season was throwing gasing, which are large tops weighing around , which are thrown by unfurling a rope and scooped off the ground while spinning. They are known to be able to spin for over an hour. Other sports are dragon dancing and dragon-boat racing. Malaysia's coastline is popular for scuba diving, sailing, and other water sports and activities. Whitewater rafting and trekking are also often done. Many international sports are highly popular in Malaysia. Badminton matches in Malaysia attract thousands of spectators, and Malaysia, along with Indonesia and China, has consistently held the Thomas Cup since 1949. Famous players include Lee Chong Wei. The Malaysian Lawn Bowls Federation (PLBM) was registered in 1997, and already fields a strong international team and has made progress on the international stage. Squash was brought to Malaysia by members of the British army, with the first competition being held in 1939. The Squash Racquets Association of Malaysia (SRAM) was created on 25 June 1972, and has had great success in Asian squash competitions. Football is popular in Malaysia, and Malaysia has proposed a Southeast Asian football league. Hockey is popular in Malaysia, with the Malaysian team ranked 14th in the world as of 2010. Malaysia hosted the third Hockey World Cup at the Merdeka Stadium in Kuala Lumpur, before also hosting the 10th cup. Malaysia has its own Formula One track, the Sepang International Circuit. It runs for , and held its first Grand Prix in 2000. Golf is growing in popularity, with many courses being built around the country. Gasing spinning top at the cultural center Gelanggang Seni The Federation of Malaya Olympic Council was formed in 1953, and received recognition by the International Olympic Committee in 1954. It first participated in the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games. The council was renamed the Olympic Council of Malaysia in 1964, and has participated in all but one Olympic games since the council was formed. The largest number of athletes sent to the Olympics was 57, to the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Malaysian athletes have won a total of four Olympic medals, all of which are in badminton. Malaysia has competed at the Commonwealth Games since 1950 as Malaya, and 1966 as Malaysia. It has been dominant in badminton, and hosted the games in Kuala Lumpur in 1998. The 1998 Commonwealth Games were the first time the torch relay went through more nations than just England and the host country. Media Much of the Malaysian media is tied to the ruling UMNO party, with the county's main newspaper owned by the government and political parties in the ruling coalition. Major opposition parties also have their own newspapers. Besides Malay newspapers, there is large circulation of English, Chinese, and Tamil dailies. The media has been blamed for increasing tension between Indonesia and Malaysia, and giving Malaysians a bad image of Indonesians. There is a divide between the media in the two halves of Malaysia. Peninsular-based media gives low priority to news from East Malaysia, and often treats it as a colony of the Peninsular. Internet access is rare outside the main urban centres, and those of the lower classes have less access to non-government news sources. The regulated freedom of the press has been criticised, and it has been claimed that the government threatens journalists with reduced employment opportunities and denial of family admittance to universities.McAdams, Mindy (2007). Why journalists act like chickens. Retrieved 1 April 2007. The Malaysian government has previously tried to crack down on opposition papers before elections when the ruling party was unsure of its political situation. In 2007, a government agency issued a directive to all private television and radio stations to refrain from broadcasting speeches made by opposition leaders, a move condemned by politicians from the opposition Democratic Action Party. Sabah, where only one tabloid is not independent of government control, has the freest press in Malaysia. Legislation such as the Printing Presses and Publications Act has been cited as curtailing freedom of expression. The Malaysian government has large control over the media due to this Act, which stipulates that a media organisation must have the government's permission to operate. However, the \\"Bill of Guarantee of No Internet Censorship\\" passed in the 1990s means that internet news is uncensored. =Cinema= Malaysian filming has gone through five stages. The first stage occurred when narrative filmmaking began in 1933, with the production of Laila Majnun by a company operating out of Singapore. For the first couple of decades following World War II, most films were directed by directors from India and the Philippines, which produced a second stage of movies. The first locally directed film, Permata di-Perlembahan, was produced in 1952. It however failed in the cinemas. A third stage appeared as Singapore-based studios began to produce films in the 1950s, but the industry was subsequently damaged due to independence of Singapore and the loss of studios there. Indonesian films gained popularity at this time, although a small group of filmmakers continued to produce in Malaysia, forming the fourth stage. In the 1980s the local industry began to recover, bringing about the fifth and most eloquent stage, which covered more themes than any previous stage. This was also the first time non-Malay films began to have a significant presence. The government began to sponsor films in 1975, creating the National Film Development Corporation in 1981. Through this the government offers loans to filmmaker's who want to develop films, however the criteria for obtaining funds has been criticised as promoting only commercial films. Due to this lack of government funding for smaller projects, a strong independent film movement has developed. There has been a large increase in short films, which in the past two decades have begun to gain status in international film festivals. Independent documentaries often cover areas which would normally be censored by the government, such as sex and sexuality, as well as racial inequality and tension. Although the government has criticised some films for not showing multiculturalism, its actions have been inconsistent in that respect, and often favour the Malay culture over others.

It is a thematic followup to Coupland's first novel, Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture. The novel deals with Tyler, a Global Teen, who shares many characteristics of the character Tyler from Generation X, the younger brother of Andy, Generation X's narrator. The novel tells the story of Tyler's life as he arrives home from Europe, and the fallout of this trip and beyond. Synopsis =Part One= Part one begins shortly after Tyler's return from a European vacation. He is in a relationship with a girl named Anna-Louise, and dreams of working for American Defense Contractor, Bechtel. He is obsessed with his haircare products, having a collection of different brand name products, most featuring names invented by Coupland. The first part of the novel details Tyler's life in Lancaster, Washington. The town is a near ghost town, after the town's largest employer, the Plants, was shut down. The effects of the Plants' shutdown has caused many problems in the town, including the boarding up of many stores in the local mall. Tyler's family life is composed of himself, his mother, and his two siblings. He calls his mother by her first name, Jasmine. Jasmine is an ex-hippie who is married to an alcoholic man named Dan. At the very introduction of the novel, Dan divorces Jasmine. Tyler, his sister, Daisy, and his brother, Mark, band together to help Jasmine through her troubling time. Tyler's grandparents are also introduced. They are quite wealthy, but they will not share their wealth with their family members. They have decided to start selling a product satirically labeled KittyWhip, which is a gourmet cat food product line. =Part two= At the beginning of this part, two of Tyler's compatriots from his European vacation decide to visit Tyler in Lancaster. They are Monique and Stephanie. Stephanie is Tyler's secret shame from Europe, as he had a summer relationship with her. Tyler tells us about his European vacation, and the events that lead to him meeting Stephanie, and what it means to have Stephanie visit them in Lancaster. Tyler's world starts to turn upside down, as his Grandparents lose their fortune, his mother becomes a KittyWhip salesperson, and his relationship with Anna-Louise enters a rough patch. Tyler feels himself become more drawn to Stephanie than Anna-Louise. =Part Three= Tyler, deciding that his life in Lancaster is not interesting enough, leaves with Stephanie to live in Los Angeles. His time in Los Angeles is wrought with strife. Tyler's worst fear becomes realized as he finds himself working at a chicken fry shop manning the fryer. It is in Los Angeles that Tyler begins to comprehend advice that his mother gave him about loneliness. Inspiration The novel is about the generation after the X generation. The primary character, Tyler, is a \\"Global Teen\\", what was popularly labeled in the media as Generation Y. They are the children of the hippy generation, who \\"react by loving corporations, and they don't mind wearing ties. To them, Ronald Reagan is emperor\\".Kate Muir, \\"To label lovers everywhere\\", The Times, August 17, 1992 They exist in a globally connected world marked out by advertising and corporate power. They are optimistic when compared with their siblings in the X Generation. However, they do not have experience with leaders who show care for other people. \\"I still remember Jimmy Carter. I still remember Pierre Trudeau. I still remember a time when society cared about other people. But there's nothing in these kids' databases to show that there are other options, that it wasn't always dog eat dog. Older people have to somehow convince young people that better things are possible.\\" History of the novel Being released in the shadow of Generation X, Shampoo Planet is considered another Zeitgeist catching novel. Its depiction of the Global Teen generation is similar to the depiction of Generation X in the previous novel, yet it suffers from comparison to Generation X. Coupland himself has claimed that the novel is too contrived.\\"Close to the Edge\\", The Observer, August 24, 2003 However, the novel has retained its individual sense, and become a historical artifact of the times that brought about its creation.

The idea of publishing the Kwang Hwa Pao or 'Glorious Chinese Newspaper' was originally conceived when Dr Sun, Hu Hanmin, Huang Xing and Wang Jingwei visited Penang in 1907. The plan was aborted when financial backing wavered due to the collapse of tin prices. The Yangon branch of the Tongmenghui took up the idea and started the Yan Kon Kwang Hwa Pao. After a short run, the Rangoon paper was banned by the British colonial government due to its radical stance. Subsequently, the Rangoon Tongmenghui leader Zhuang Yin'an came to Penang and a committee was formed to revive the Kwang Hwa Pao as a daily paper. Renamed Kwong Wah Yit Poh, the newspaper was first printed at and published from at 120 Armenian Street, the current address of the Penang Philomatic Union. The first premises of the Kwong Wah Yit Poh is now the Sun Yat Sen Museum Penang. The house where the Kwong Wah Yit Poh was founded has been preserved as the Sun Yat-sen Museum Penang. Kwong Wah Yit Poh is one of the oldest Chinese-language newspapers in Malaysia (Nanyang Siang Pau is the oldest national Chinese-language newspaper), outside of Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as one of the world's oldest surviving Chinese newspaper (Ta Kung Pao is the oldest active Chinese-language newspaper in the world). However, it is not the first Chinese language newspaper in Malaysia. The newspaper had ceased publication in 1927 for almost a decade, and then again in 1941 due to World War II, and its publication did not resume until 1946. In 1936, Kwong Wah Yit Poh acquired Penang Sin Poe (established 1895), Penang's first Chinese newspaper which also had originally traced back the history of Kwong Wah Yit Poh. Despite the change in ownership, Penang Sin Poe continued to be published until 30 September 1941. Kwong Wah Yit Poh went into a decline in the 1960s after the death of two directors. In the 1971, The Star began publication and had once worked together with Kwong Wah Yit Poh. However, the newspaper continued to make losses, and The Star became independent from Kwong Wah Yit Poh. The Star became a national daily newspaper in 1976, but the headquarters relocated to Kuala Lumpur in 1978 and then Petaling Jaya in 1981. Despite being Malaysia's longest running Chinese-language newspaper, the daily is not recognised as a national newspaper, but it has the largest readership in the northern region.

The six-storey building situated at the junction of Serangoon Road and Owen Road rapidly collapsed, trapping 50 people beneath the rubble. (Book launch website for: ) Seventeen people were rescued, whereas 33 people were killed.  Background  Frequently referred to as Hotel New World, the building in question was officially called the Lian Yak Building (). It was completed in 1971 and consisted of six stories and a basement garage. The Hotel New World, previously known as the New Serangoon Hotel until 1984, was the main tenant occupying the top four floors, and a branch of the Industrial & Commercial Bank (which merged with United Overseas Bank in 1987) took up the ground level. A nightclub, Universal Neptune Nite- Club and Restaurant, was situated on the second level of the building at the time of the collapse. The building had previously experienced a poisonous gas leak (caused by carbon monoxide) in some of the hotel rooms, first hitting the headlines on 30 August 1975, the day after the poisonous gas leak was reported.  Collapse  On 15 March 1986, the building rapidly disintegrated in less than a minute at about , leaving little time for anyone within it to make their escape. Witnesses reported hearing an explosion prior to the collapse, but the police ruled out the possibility of a bomb attack. A gas explosion was thought to be a possible cause. The collapse was met with shock by many, including the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew who was quoted as saying that \\"the collapse of such a building is unprecedented.\\" = Casualties = Immediately after the collapse, as many as 300 were feared trapped underneath the debris. Estimates dropped to 100 trapped or missing a day later, and then to 60, including 26 hotel staff and 16 bank staff unaccounted for. The figure was finally put at 33 when the official death toll was announced on 22 March 1986 after the end of the rescue effort. Amongst those killed, 23 were Singaporeans, and the other ten foreigners. = Rescue = After the collapse, many passers-by began to try pulling out survivors. They were soon joined by the Singapore Fire Service (SFS), the Police Task Force of the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). A nearby business, Eagle Piano Company, became a centre for the rescue operation. As there were survivors buried in the rubble, the rescue was a delicate operation. Debris was carefully removed as power saws and drills cut through the rubble. Sound detectors were used to locate survivors beneath the slabs by picking up faint moans and cries. In the first 12 hours, nine people were rescued. At one time, Lieutenant-Colonel Lim Meng Kin (SAF Chief Medical Officer), along with several other SAF medical officers and two doctors from the Health Ministry, took turns to crawl through narrow spaces inside the rubble in an effort to provide assistance to trapped survivors, giving glucose and saline drips to them. Tunnelling experts from Britain, Ireland and Japan who were involved in nearby construction for the (Singapore) Mass Rapid Transit, including Thomas \\"Tommy\\" Gallagher, Thomas Mulleary, Norman Duke, Patrick \\"PJ\\" Gallagher, Michael Prendergast, Michael \\"Mickey\\" Scott, and Tan Jin Thong, offered to assist. They became concerned that the use of heavy machinery would collapse the rubble onto those trapped. Their voluntary efforts, digging 4 tunnels under the rubble, resulted in the rescue of another eight survivors. The tunnelling experts were later honoured by the Singapore government for their efforts. Thomas Mulleary was also nominated for an O.B.E for his rescue work but refused the prestigious honour when the rest of the rescue squad was not included. The last survivor, 30-year-old Chua Kim Choo, was rescued on 18 March 1986, having survived after hiding beneath a table. Following the six-day rescue operation that ended on 21 March, 17 people were rescued, but 33 people lost their lives.  Outcome  = Inquiry = Many potential causes of the accident were investigated. Surviving sections of concrete were tested to ensure they were built to proper construction standards and it was found that they were. The construction work of the underground railway ‚Äì built by tunnellers who had assisted in the rescue ‚Äì was investigated, even though the excavations were more than 100 yards from the collapsed building. It was found they had no effect on the building's stability. Also investigated were the various additions made to the building after its initial construction. Air conditioning systems had been constructed on the roof of the building, the bank had added a large safe, and ceramic tiles had been fixed to the building's exterior, all adding considerably to the building's weight. It was found that the weight of these additions was inconsequential: the original structural engineer had made a serious error in calculating the building's structural load. The structural engineer had calculated the building's live load (the weight of the building's potential inhabitants, furniture, fixtures, and fittings) but the building's dead load (the weight of the building itself) was completely omitted from the calculation. This meant that the building as constructed could not support its own weight. Collapsing was only a matter of time. After three different supporting columns failed in the days before the disaster, the other columns‚Äîwhich took on the added weight no longer supported by the failed columns‚Äîcould not support the building. According to Channel News Asia, Lian Yak Building was designed by an unqualified draftsman instead of a professional structural engineer. An investigator found that he had over- estimated the dead weight which the columns and walls could support. The draftsman claimed that the building owner Ng Khong Lim, who eventually died in the collapse incident, had appointed him to design Lian Yak Building but Ng directed that building work. The investigator also found that Ng requested to use inferior materials to build Lian Yak Building in order to reduce the cost. = Aftermath = On 27 April 1986, the Government of Singapore honoured five individuals for their assistance in rescue efforts, including three from Ireland, one from Britain, and a local. A dinner was also hosted by the Singapore government on 29 April 1986 for SMRT Corporation staff involved in the rescue effort, with the then Minister of Communications and Information, Yeo Ning Hong, as the Guest-of-Honour. Following this disaster, buildings built in the 1970s were checked for structural faults, and some of them were declared structurally unsound and had to be evacuated, including the main block of Hwa Chong Junior College and Catholic High School campus at Queen Street. The government also introduced tighter regulations on building construction; since 1989, all structural designs are required to be counter- checked by Accredited Checkers. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) underwent a significant upgrade, in terms of training and equipment, to improve its readiness in performing complex rescue operations. Five years after the collapse, construction work commenced on the site for a new seven- story hotel on 28 March 1991. The Fortuna Hotel opened with 85 rooms in 1994. = In media = In July 1986, singer-songwriter Kelvin Tan contributed to BigO magazine's Nothing on the Radio cassette the song \\"Seen the End\\", after spending two nights at the former Hotel New World site. In 1990, the disaster was re-enacted in the Chinese-language television series Finishing Line (Âá∫‰∫∫Â§¥Âú∞), which was aired on SBC 8 (now MediaCorp Channel 8). On 25 September 2003, the disaster was featured in the first episode of the second season of the television series True Courage, which was broadcast on MediaCorp TV Channel 5 (now MediaCorp Channel 5). A Chinese-language version of the series, titled True Courage (ÈÄÜÂ¢ÉÂãáËÄÖ), was also on aired on MediaCorp TV Channel 8 (now MediaCorp Channel 8). On 27 September 2005, Seconds From Disaster portrayed the disaster in the episode \\"Hotel Collapse Singapore\\". Instead of the actual site, the program used an image of the area around 88 Syed Alwi Road (at the corner of Kampon Kapor Road) as the basis for a computer-generated reconstruction of the building and its collapse. The episode was retelecast in Singapore on 16 September 2007 via StarHub TV. In February 2015, Days of Disasters also portrayed the disaster in the episode \\"Hotel New World Collapse\\".

Accident circumstances  Headed by a LMS Class 5 4-6-0 steam locomotive No 45274, the 12:15 York to Bristol express, consisting of ten carriages, approached Sutton Coldfield railway station at about 55-60 mph (88-96 km/h) ‚Äî twice the permitted speed of 30 mph. When it reached the sharp curve immediately before the station, the train derailed, colliding with the platforms. The carriages, engine, and station buildings were severely damaged. The first carriage was crushed between the engine and the second carriage. The fourth carriage was knocked into the air causing it to drag along the station roof, damaging both the roof and the platforms to either side. Seventeen people, including the train crew, were killed and 25 injured. The train had been diverted away from its usual route into Birmingham via Tamworth because of engineering work. The regular driver did not know the diversionary route via Sutton Coldfield, so another driver, fully conversant with it, had joined him at Burton-on-Trent to 'conduct' him over this section. However, the regular driver, complaining that the rough riding of the engine was tiring him, left the footplate and took a seat in the train, leaving the conductor driver in charge. This action was later criticised by the Inspecting Officer who commented that, even though he did not know the route, the safety of the train was still his responsibility. Emergency response The number of casualties was prevented from rising as a result of the actions of two local people who rushed up the railway line to stop a train heading towards the crash site. Two railway employees also raised the alarm to other stations, changed the signals to danger and placed detonators on the tracks to warn oncoming trains. One of the two had been injured and shocked by the accident, and both were rewarded with gold watches for their work. The scene was attended to by a mobile surgical unit from Birmingham Accident Hospital as well as 40 additional ambulances from surrounding districts. Royal Air Force servicemen from Whitehouse Common provided aid to the emergency services. Possible causes Although the excessive speed was the major factor in the accident, the exact cause was never fully established. The accident occurred in broad daylight and the driver knew the line well. There was no evidence of mechanical failure on the train. The driver and fireman died in the locomotive, so the reason for the excessive speed was never established. Investigators identified several factors that could have contributed to the excessive speed: *The train was running late and making up time. *There was a gradient to climb after the station which was best approached at full speed. *The steam locomotive (like most at the time) was not fitted with a speedometer. *The engine was riding roughly, which may have contributed to the driver's misjudging the speed. It seems therefore that the driver knew he was exceeding the speed limit but did not realise the extent of the danger (similar to the Salisbury rail crash of 1906).  Consequences  Memorial at Sutton Coldfield station to the victims of the crash Following this accident, lineside speed restriction signs were universally adopted; previously there had been no visual reminder to the driver of speed restrictions on many routes. The Inspector also suggested the use of speed recorders, as in France, but this was not adopted. On 23 January 2016, the 61st anniversary of the crash, a memorial to the victims was unveiled, at Sutton Coldfield station, by the Lord Mayor of Birmingham, Councillor Ray Hassall.

Some smaller sized aviaries can often be found in European manorial gardens, such as Waddesdon Manor, UK, and Versailles, France. Some public aquaria, such as the Oregon Coast Aquarium, Newport, Oregon, or the Monterey Bay Aquarium, have aquatic aviaries.Birds , Oregon Coast Aquarium's official website, retrieved on February 3, 2007.Sandy Shores , Monterey Bay Aquarium's official website , retrieved on February 3, 2007. Home aviaries are popular with some bird fanciers who have the space for them. Many bird breeders list themselves as \\"aviaries\\", since most bird pairs breed best in aviaries in contrast to breeding cages. Home aviaries may be built by the owner or obtained from a commercial supplier. There are two main subcategories of home aviaries: grounded aviaries and suspended aviaries. Grounded aviaries are affixed to the ground with a concrete base to prevent rats and other vermin from entering. Suspended aviaries are suspended in the air with only the 'legs' of the aviaries affixed to the ground; hence, the need for a protective base is eliminated in suspended aviaries. Most grounded aviaries typically feature a woodwork or PVC frame unlike the metal frame of public aviaries; however, it isn't uncommon for suspended aviaries to feature a metal frame. Aviaries are also used for research purposes in ornithology institutes  History  = Early Modern Origins = An aviary, a large cage to house and display birds, dates as far back and possibly earlier than the 1500s found in the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan as noted by Hernan Cortes when he and his men arrived in 1521. Also the Raven Cage (created in 1829), is regarded as one of the oldest structures in the London Zoo. Bali Myna, otherwise known as the Rothschild Myna, is one of the seven EAZA species at Waddesdon Manor's Aviary in Buckinghamshire, UK = Victorian Revival = Proposed architectural design for a French military aviary to house swallows as messenger birds, based upon a scheme by Jean Desbouvrie, 1889.The first large aviary inside a zoological garden was established in 1880 in the setting of the Rotterdam Zoo. Aviaries were an important aspect for the many Rothschild houses that proliferated across Europe in the 19th century. This was a recalling of the aristocratic custom from the late 1600s, which involved the elite society displaying their power, status and wealth through the exhibition of exotic birds and animals. For instance, Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild built his aviary in 1889 at Waddesdon Manor, UK, erected in the style of Versailles' trelliswork pavilions. = 20th-century to modern day = In 1902, a flying cage was completed in the setting of the National Zoological Park of the Smithsonian Institution. A new Great Flying Cage was built in 1964.National Zoological Park, Records, 1887‚Äì1966, Smithsonian Institution Archives. The Saint Louis Zoo is home to the 1904 World's Fair Flight Cage. It is one of only two permanent structures built for the World's Fair which still remain (the other is the Saint Louis Art Museum's Cass Gilbert building). In 1904, it was the largest bird cage ever built. It remains one of the world's largest free- flight aviaries. The long, wide, and high cage was built by the Smithsonian Institution specifically for the St. Louis World's Fair. Local pride in the giant cage motivated St. Louis to finally establish a zoo in 1910. In 1937, the San Diego Zoo's aviary designed by architect Louis John Gill opened; it was then the largest in the world. The mammoth steel structure, long, wide and more than high, funded by the Works Progress Administration at a cost of $50,000, had no beams, cross or guy-wires to impede the flight of the birds.\\"Giant Zoo Cage to be Dedicated by Eagles Soon,\\" San Diego Union, February 21, 1937.San Diego Historical Society With the Antwerp cage system (1948), birds are only separate from public with a light system used indoor the Bird Building at Antwerp Zoo.\\"European zoos\\", Life, Vol. 25, No. 23, December 6, 1948. At the Frankfurt Zoo, the bird house was built in 1969. Its Bird Halls presented birds for the first time in large glassed miniature habitats. In diving exhibits, darters and kingfishers could be seen hunting under water, and in the free-flight hall visitors still walk amongst tropical birds in dense vegetation.Petzold, Dirk, \\"Zoologischer Garten Frankfurt am Main\\", in Encyclopedia of the World's Zoos, Bell, Catharine E.

Paster posted $20,000 bail, but fled Oregon and was not apprehended until June 1984 in Englewood, Colorado. In November 1985, Paster was sentenced to 20 years in prison by a Multnomah County circuit judge.

An exhibition showing the intellectual property (IP) behind Steve Jobs‚Äô innovations opened to the public at WIPO on 30 March 2012 and ran through to World Intellectual Property Day on 26 April 2012.

History  Following a statement made at the Assembly of the Member States of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in September 1998, the Director General of the National Algerian Institute for Industrial Property (INAPI) proposed on 7 April 1999 the institutionalisation of an international day for intellectual property, with the aim of :\\"[setting up] a framework for broader mobilization and awareness, [opening up] access to the promotional aspect of innovation and [recognizing] the achievements of promoters of intellectual property throughout the world.\\"Letter of 7 April 1999 from Amor Bouhnik, Director General of the National Algerian Institute for Industrial Property, to the Director General of WIPO (Ref: 027 DG/MS/99) in World Intellectual Property Organization web site, , WO/GA/24/7, 10 August 1999. On 9 August 1999, the Chinese delegation to the WIPO proposed the adoption of the \\"World Intellectual Property Day\\" :\\"in order to further promote the awareness of intellectual property protection, expand the influence of intellectual property protection across the world, urge countries to publicize and popularize intellectual property protection laws and regulations, enhance the public legal awareness of intellectual property rights, encourage invention- innovation activities in various countries and strengthen international exchange in the intellectual property field\\".Letter dated 9 August 1999 from Jiang Ying, Commissioner of the State Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic of China, to Dr. Kamil Idris, Director General of World Intellectual Property Organization, Geneva, Switzerland, in World Intellectual Property Organization web site, , 20 August 1999.

Criticism  Mike Masnick of Techdirt wrote that World Intellectual Property Day is intended \\"to promote ever greater protectionism and mercantilism in favor of copyright holders and patent holders, while ignoring any impact on the public of those things. It's a fairly disgusting distortion of the claimed intent of intellectual property.\\" Zak Rogoff of the Defective by Design noted that this event is a \\"global but decidedly not grassroots event\\". This event has also been criticized by the activists from civil society organizations such as IP Justice and the Electronic Information for Libraries who consider it one-sided propaganda as the marketing materials associated with the event, provided by WIPO, \\"come across as unrepresentative of other views and events\\".Sandra Bangasser, 2009, Multilateral Institutions and the Recontextualization of Political Marketing: How the World Intellectual Property Organization‚Äôs Outreach Efforts Reflect Changing Audiences.

The show focused on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a \\"well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot\\", is a caricature of televised political pundits. Furthermore, the show satirized conservative personality-driven political talk programs, particularly Fox News's The O'Reilly Factor. The Colbert Report is a spin-off of Comedy Central's The Daily Show, where Colbert acted as a correspondent for the program for several years while developing the character. The program was created by Colbert, Jon Stewart, and Ben Karlin. The show's writing was grounded in improvisation, and often lampooned current events stories. The show's structure also included a guest interview, in which the Colbert character attempts to deconstruct his opponent's argument. The show was taped in New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, and the program's set is \\"hyper-American\\", epitomizing the character's ego. The show was taped and broadcast Monday through Thursday, with weeks taken off at multiple points in a given year for breaks. The Colbert Report saw immediate critical and ratings successes, leading to various awards, including two Peabody Awards. The show's cultural influence‚Äîwhich occasionally would require a fair degree of participation from the show's audience, dubbed the Colbert Nation‚Äîextended beyond the program a number of times. This impact included the character running for U.S. President twice, co-hosting a rally at the National Mall, presenting a controversial performance at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, and establishing a real Super PAC that raised a million dollars. In addition, the show inspired various forms of multimedia, including music and multiple best-selling books. Background Colbert on the set of The Colbert Report in 2011. The Colbert Report satirized conservative personality-driven political pundit programs, and focused on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character first made appearances on the short- lived sketch comedy series The Dana Carvey Show in 1996, described as \\"a self- important, trench-coated reporter who does on-location stories in a way that suggests his own presence is the real scoop.\\" Colbert joined Comedy Central's The Daily Show in 1997, a year following its launch, then hosted by Craig Kilborn. When Jon Stewart became the program's host in 1999, The Daily Show developed a markedly different style, bringing a sharper political focus to the humor than the show previously exhibited. Colbert recalled that Stewart specifically asked him to have a political viewpoint, and to allow his passion for issues to carry through into his comedy. Colbert became a fixture on The Daily Show, occasionally hosting in Stewart's absence. In 2003, the program began running advertisements for a fictional program titled The Colbert R√©port, starring Colbert as a parody of cable news pundits. When fellow Daily Show star Steve Carell left to pursue a film and television career, Comedy Central made attempts to keep Colbert at the network. He pitched The Colbert Report to the channel in 2004. Stewart pushed Comedy Central to pick up the show, and Colbert was given an eight-week tryout. Following the show's immediate success, the show \\"quickly became a fixture in the late-night lineup.\\" At its peak, the show averaged 1.5 million viewers each evening. The fictional Colbert anchorman character became gradually toned down over the course of the show's run, as the host believed he would eventually need to move beyond it. He began to regard it as an act of discipline to perform as the character; he later remarked, \\"to model behavior, you have to consume that behavior on a regular basis. It became very hard to watch punditry of any kind, of whatever political stripe.\\" With his contract set to end in December 2014, he had already decided to leave the show when he was contacted by CBS to replace David Letterman as the host of its Late Show franchise. The show's ending was announced concurrently with Colbert's jump to CBS in April 2014. The last episode aired on December 18, 2014. The show was replaced on Comedy Central's late-night lineup by The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, another spinoff of The Daily Show. History =Development= The show is a spin- off of The Daily Show, hosted by Jon Stewart, seen here in 2005. The character first made appearances on the short-lived sketch comedy series The Dana Carvey Show in 1996, described as \\"a self-important, trench-coated reporter who does on-location stories in a way that suggests his own presence is the real scoop.\\" When The Daily Show ran short on time, a short piece starring Colbert, advertising a fictional program titled The Colbert R√©port, was added into the program. In these sketches, Colbert began to amplify his character to parody news pundits. Colbert anchored many sketches in his persona, including \\"Even Stepvhen\\", in which he debated current issues with fellow correspondent Steve Carell, often devolving into petty name-calling and insults. Colbert and Carell were viewed as potential breakout stars by staff, and when Carell left the series in 2004 to start a US version of The Office, Comedy Central made attempts to keep Colbert at the network. Stewart and Karlin were already looking to expand the Daily Show franchise and their production company, Busboy. The duo supposedly came up with the idea for The Colbert Report after watching coverage of the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Bill O'Reilly. Colbert met with network president Doug Herzog the day following the 2004 Emmy Awards to first discuss the concept. The one-line pitch Colbert, Karlin and Stewart developed was \\"Our version of the O'Reilly Factor with Stephen Colbert.\\" Herzog committed to an eight-week tryout period without a pilot. By the time of the 2004 election, the character was fully developed. In creating the character, which is designed to be repellant but entertaining, Colbert conferred with Stewart and Karlin. In expressing his hope that his character not be \\"an asshole,\\" Stewart remarked, \\"You're not an asshole. You're an idiot. There's a difference.\\" Head writer Allison Silverman reiterated this trait in a later interview, commenting, \\"There is an essential innocence to his character.\\" Colbert initially felt the character might not be sustainable in a longer format. Despite this, The Colbert Report was designed as an extension of the satiric goals of The Daily Show, combining it with general silliness and character-driven humor. To make sure there was no overlap in subject matter with The Daily Show, Karlin made trips between the studios during the show's early days to supervise scripts. For the first several years of the program, Colbert made an appearance at the end of each Daily Show in split-screen, having a short discussion with Stewart preceding his show. =Production= The show's writing was grounded in improv, employing a \\"yes to everything\\" mentality. Much of the humor derived from extended improv games with the show's studio and at-home audience, such as Colbert's poll to name a bridge in Hungary after himself. Many of the writers had improv training and at one point put together \\"improv evenings\\" at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre once a month. Writers on The Colbert Report were predominantly male and white; Colbert acknowledged this lack of diversity, but he contended he had hired writers based solely on the quality of their material and had never looked at the names on writing packets submitted for employment. Subjects considered too dark were not even considered for comedic material; for example, the show would poke fun at press coverage of a tragedy, rather than the tragedy itself. Issues discussed on the show were later reported on actual newscasts, in turn allowing the show to comment on its own impact, creating an echo chamber of sorts. This led Colbert to describe his show, \\"at its purest expression, [as] a pebble that we throw into the puddle of the news, and then we report on our own ripples.\\" Ideas for each show were considered in the morning pitch meeting, which could range from \\"harrowing\\" to smooth. Described as having \\"demanding standards\\", Colbert is quoted as remarking, \\"Let's make it perfect and then cut it.\\" Although dozens of ideas were either chosen for the show or deleted, other ideas, saved for a later date, were often forgotten because of the pace of news. Ideas with considerable potential were put in the \\"hopper\\" to be developed and rewritten, while more fully formed ideas were placed in the \\"pantry.\\" Good jokes would still be sacrificed if they did not fit the character's specific point of view, which was deemed the inverse of what \\"any logical person\\" feels. At least one writer has described the job as \\"all-consuming\\", leaving no time for outside activities. Colbert himself eventually became withdrawn from morning meetings as the show continued on and he mulled a decision to leave. Outside the studio Usually by 11 a.m., a rough outline for the show was completed and writers sent off in pairs to create scripts that would be polished throughout the day. First, writers would scan news articles for ideas and partner together in pairs, with one \\"keeping track of possible jokes.\\" During an appearance at the New York Comedy Festival in 2013, some writers admitted to procrastinating until the last hour before rehearsal to complete their sections; Colbert confirmed that, in the program's early days, segments such as \\"The Word\\" were scripted entirely during the rewrite before rehearsal. Both writers read their dialogue aloud to see whether they thought the Colbert character would say it. As writers were working on their respective scripts, the show's production and graphics team compiled music, footage, and props needed for the show. To collect video clips, the show cross-referenced transcripts of hours and hours of archived TiVo recordings of news programs. In 2011, the show switched to Snapstream software, which streamlined the TV clip search and compilation process, allowing for searching closed captioning for select words. In addition, a group of staff coders and independent contractors developed Scripto software to collaborate on scripts in real time. By 1 p.m., the show held a second production meeting to go over scripts and determine which pieces to edit. Scripts were \\"hopefully\\" completed around 4 p.m., and a rehearsal with the entire staff would begin at 5:30 p.m. or occasionally earlier. Afterward, final changes were made to the script. The final rewrite would take place in a \\"small, red, poorly ventilated room\\" until 6:45 p.m. Before interviewing his guests, Colbert met with them in the green room and acknowledged that he was playing a character, noting that the persona is \\"willfully ignorant of what you know and care about\\" and urging the guest to \\"honestly disabuse me of what you see as my ignorance.\\" Emily Lazar, a producer for the interview segments, advised guests to talk with Colbert as though he were a \\"harmless drunk at the next bar stool.\\" Guests would typically take their seats around 7 p.m., when a warm-up comedian (perhaps Jared Logan or Paul Mercurio) delivered jokes. Colbert, out of character, held a brief question and answer session with the audience prior to taping. Taping lasted as long as three hours but usually ended around 9 p.m., at which point the show was edited and sent to Comedy Central for broadcast. As the show was being edited, the staff met one last time to work through details for the next show. =Set= First Lady Michelle Obama in 2012. The Colbert Report was taped and broadcast four nights a week, Monday‚ÄìThursday. The show's taping studio, at 513 W. 54th Street in New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, was used for The Daily Show until July 2005, and has a capacity of 150. NEP Studio 54 on 54th Street is owned by NEP Broadcasting which is New York City's largest production facility and also owns The Daily Show set at NEP Studio 52 two blocks south on 52nd Street. Aside from the set, the show's production offices have been described as \\"loft-like\\" and \\"all overhead pipes and exposed brick.\\" Following the show's conclusion, the building was used for The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore. The set for The Colbert Report was called \\"The Eagle's Nest\\" and reflects and facilitates Colbert's self-aggrandizing style. It was designed by Jim Fenhagen, and was intended to both capture the character's ego and be \\"hyper-American.\\" Elements incorporated into the set included architectural lines converged to Colbert's desk, and radial beams coming out from behind his chair. Colbert's main influence for the set was Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper, with the Colbert character as Jesus Christ. In the set, \\"virtually every inch emblazoned with Colbert's name or the initial C\\"; his name, initials and the name of the show appear on the desk's plasma screen, on the rafters above the desk, and the desk itself is shaped like a giant \\"C\\". The background includes faux artifacts from the character's backstory, which are seldom seen by viewers. \\"I kept saying, 'People might not really notice this.' But when you're working with a comedy team, they really get into it. They couldn't help themselves,\\" said Fenhagen. Among these touches are the United States Constitution, a miniature Ten Commandments, and a CliffsNotes guide to American government. The set was described as \\"part Riefenstahlesque homage to the star, part symbologic gallery ‚Äî where alert viewers are rewarded with snarky jokes at every turn.\\" Above a fireplace is a portrait of Colbert; it originally showed Colbert standing in front of the same mantel with another portrait of himself. On the show's first anniversary, the portrait was replaced by one of Colbert standing in front of the mantel with the first portrait above it, and with each successive year, it became Colbert standing in front of the previous year's painting. The graphics used throughout the show and the studio itself are saturated with American flags, bald eagles, Captain America's shield, and other patriotic imagery. Format Typically, Colbert starts with the audience cheering and teasers regarding the show's topics and guest; each headline is structured to be a deliberate pun. The series of puns are followed by a verbal metaphor that promotes the show and is almost always finished with, \\"This is the Colbert Report.\\" The show's original opening title sequence began with an eagle diving past the host, following by images of Americana, stock footage of Colbert, and words describing Colbert flying by (some of which have been used as The Word). The first word used was \\"Grippy\\", and has changed to include, among others, \\"Megamerican\\", \\"Lincolnish\\", \\"Superstantial\\", \\"Flagaphile\\", and \\"Factose Intolerant\\". The May 4 episode in 2009 featured hints planted by J. J. Abrams about when and where Colbert would be in the Persian Gulf,http://www.argn.com/2009/05/stephen_colbert_speaks_with_jj_abrams_gets_ideas/ JJ Abrams and \\"Farewellison\\" for the final episode of former producer Allison Silverman.http://www.tv.com/shows/the-colbert-report/trivia/season-all/10 Farewellison The show's opening credits depict the Colbert character clutching an American flag. On January 4, 2010, a new opening debuted. The opening begins and ends with an eagle as before, but features new background renderings, new shots of Stephen Colbert, and is now colored in an American, red white and blue motif. The show's theme music is \\"Baby Mumbles\\" by Cheap Trick. Colbert phoned guitarist Rick Nielsen during development of the show to discuss the theme, noting that he loved the band's song \\"I Want You to Want Me\\"; the show's theme music is largely that song's melody backwards. Following the opening sequence, Colbert most often proceeds with a run-through of recent headlines in a manner parodying traditional news broadcasts; this is similar to The Daily Show but with a faux-right-wing spin. The program typically continues with Colbert addressing a specific topic. Colbert often calls to \\"Jimmy\\", a reference to program director Jim Hoskinson, to roll video clips. That topic will often lead into a \\"The Word\\" segment, which juxtaposes Colbert's commentary with satirical bullet points on-screen, a parody of The O'Reilly Factors \\"Talking Points Memo\\". On occasion he will conduct a short interview with someone having to do with the topic. The format of the middle segment varies, but it is normally a visual presentation or skit. Often, these skits are parts of recurring segments, which may include \\"Better Know a District\\", in which Colbert interviews a U.S. Representative from a certain district of the United States; \\"Tip of the Hat/Wag of the Finger\\", in which Colbert voices his approval or disapproval of prominent people and news items; \\"Cheating Death with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, D.F.A.\\", a health segment; \\"The Sport Report\\" with the \\"t\\" in both Sport and Report silent, a sports segment; and \\"The ThreatDown\\", in which Colbert lists the five greatest threats to America, and others. His newest segment, \\"Thought for Food\\" deals with the consumption of specific foods across the world. Sometimes, there is a \\"Colbert Report Special Repor-t\\" (the final 't' pronounced with special emphasis), or even a \\"Colbert Report, Sport Report, Special Repor-t\\", in which Colbert devotes a section of an episode, and sometimes the entire episode to a special subject. The third segment is almost always an interview with a celebrity guest, often an author or government official. Unlike the late night talk show standard of the guest walking out to the host's desk, Colbert instead runs to a separate area of the set to interview his guest, basking in the applause and glory meant for the guest. On the interview segment of the show, Colbert frequently attempts to nail his guest by using various rhetorical devices and fallacies to prove them wrong. The real-life Colbert once remarked that his personal favorite segment of the program were the interviews, which involved more listening on his end in order for the character to \\"ignorantly deconstruct\\" his opponent's argument. The third segment of the show is on occasion a musical guest. Prominent musical guests have included Metallica, Paul McCartney, Rush, Green Day, Paul Simon, Crosby Stills & Nash, Pavement, Cat Stevens, Yo-Yo Ma, Radiohead and Black Star. Afterwards, Colbert ends the show by giving some parting words to the audience or, if short for time, a simple \\"that's it for the report everybody, good night\\". Character The host of The Colbert Report is Stephen Colbert, a \\"self-important right-wing commentator\\", portrayed by his real-life namesake. The character incorporates aspects of Colbert's real life, but is primarily a parody of cable news pundits, particularly Bill O'Reilly of Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor, whom he refers to as \\"Papa Bear\\". To this end, the character even incorporates O'Reilly's mannerisms, described as his \\"pen-wielding, hand-stabbing gestures.\\" O'Reilly's use of \\"talking points\\" ‚Äî illustrated onscreen graphics reflecting the host's opinions ‚Äî are parodied on The Colbert Report with the segment \\"The Word\\". He initially incorporated long-winded, verbose metaphors to parody CNN correspondent Aaron Brown. In addition, the character was also heavily inspired by Stone Phillips, Bill Kurtis and \\"especially\\" Geraldo Rivera. \\"I loved the way Geraldo made reporting a story seem like an act of courage,\\" Colbert told a reporter in 2012. The core principle of The Colbert Report is that Colbert is a \\"well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot.\\" The character believes that he himself is the news: rather than a vessel to deliver the news to the audience, or a general member of the media, the character sees himself as more important than the news. He is veracious in his approach, while often ridiculously overblown in his statements. The character is egomaniacal, fact-averse (\\"factose intolerant\\"), God-fearing, and hyper-patriotic. He claims to be an independent who is often mistaken for a Republican, but uniformly despises liberals and generally agrees with the actions and decisions of the Republican Party. Colbert's character has been described as a \\"caustic right-wing bully\\". The character exists not in opposition to political leaders, but to common ignorances; for example, his insistence that then-presidential candidate Barack Obama had Socialist leanings was based on public misconceptions. In parodying the cult of personality, the Colbert character also developed a real-life equivalent, creating what was dubbed the \\"Colbert Nation\\". While giving the character a certain mythos was part of the show's inception, show producers did not set out to create a loyal following; the joke was that the character thought he had an influence, but that was a figment of his ego-riddled imagination. The character is primarily a parody of cable news pundits, particularly Bill O'Reilly, pictured above. Despite his appearance of always being in charge, Colbert is vulnerable: he feels deeply threatened by those wielding more power than he, and he suffers from \\"arctophobia\\", the fear of bears, which he refers to as \\"giant, marauding, godless killing machines\\". He will alert the audience to what he perceives as the latest national threat (the subject of a recurring bit, \\"ThreatDown\\"), only to justify his own fears and impose those onto his audience. As the show progressed, Colbert gradually began to tone down the character, allowing guests in interviews to \\"get his or her own message across.\\" The show's longevity created what The New York Times described as \\"a winking quality to the act, a sense that we‚Äôre all in on the joke.\\" Colbert himself acknowledged that he \\"rarely hit it as hard as I used to,\\" noting that \\"You have to be vigilant to stay ignorant.\\" He noted that his own personal opinions can occasionally align with his character's, when liberal guests' agendas appeared based on dislike rather than logical argument. Politician and former vice president Al Gore accidentally referred to the persona as a \\"character\\" in a 2011 interview on the show, and in 2013, Colbert further blurred lines when he spoke regarding the death of his mother on the program. In doing so, many commentators referred the show's longevity and the development of a \\"third\\" Colbert ‚Äî one a faux pundit and one informed by the performer's own life. In the show's credits, Colbert was credited with a title, which deliberately became increasingly cumbersome as the show progressed: Her Excellency The Rev. Sir Doctor Stephen Tyrone Mos Def Colbert, D.F.A., Heavyweight Champion of the World‚ú±‚ú± featuring Flo Rida La Premiere Dame De France. When O'Reilly appeared on The Daily Show before the second episode of The Colbert Report aired, he commented, \\"Before we get started, somebody told me walking in here, you got some French guy on after you making fun of me?\\", and made several references in the following interview to 'the French Guy'. In a subsequent Newsweek interview, O'Reilly said that he \\"feels it's a compliment\\" to have Colbert parody him because Colbert \\"isn't mean- spirited\\" and does not \\"use [his] platform to injure people\\". Later, Colbert replied on-air, \\"I like you too. In fact, if it wasn't for you, this show wouldn't exist.\\" Themes Colbert disagreed that the show's emphasis on politics represented a liberal bias, noting that he himself was uninterested in modern politics. He believed that political issues reflect basic human behavior, which he viewed as his satirical specialty, noting, \\"If I thought I had a political point, I'd be in big trouble.\\" In another interview, Colbert remarked, \\"I'm not someone with a particular political ax to grind. I'm a comedian. I love hypocrisy.\\" Episodes =Notable episodes= Early years The Colbert Report premiered in October 2005. The first guest was Stone Phillips, a partial influence on the character. In the debut episode, Colbert coined the word truthiness, defined as \\"a quality characterizing a 'truth' that a person making an argument or assertion claims to know intuitively 'from the gut' or because it 'feels right' without regard to evidence, logic, intellectual examination, or facts.\\" Truthiness was named Word of the Year for 2005 by the American Dialect Society and for 2006 by Merriam-Webster. The character's forceful nature confused some in the program's early days. During an appearance on the segment \\"Better Know a District\\" in the show's first season, a frustrated Barney Frank declined to continue, deeming the conversation too dumb. In one early episode, the Colbert character purported to be a former member of a 1980s new wave group, Stephen & the Colberts, and released a fictional music video from the band for the song \\"Charlene (I'm Right Behind You)\\". The show's popularity resulted in Colbert headlining the 2006 White House Correspondents' Dinner, which he performed in character. The controversial, searing routine targeted President George W. Bush and the media, and was greeted with chilly reception from the audience. Although President Bush shook Colbert's hand after his presentation, several of Bush's aides and supporters walked out during Colbert's speech, and one former aide commented that the President had \\"that look that he's ready to blow\\". Colbert's performance quickly became an Internet and media sensation. According to Vanity Fair, the speech transformed Colbert as a \\"folk hero\\" for liberals, and was later described by Frank Rich as the \\"defining moment\\" of the 2006 midterm elections. Adam Sternbergh of New York, a year after the show's debut, deemed the character \\"something very close to what he's parodying, a kind of Bill O'Reilly for the angry left.\\" In 2006, Colbert encouraged fans to vote for his name to be the new name of a bridge in Hungary, which was being decided via an online poll; he beat the runner-up by more than 14 million votes. He was, however, disqualified, as the name of the bridge was intended to be a memoriam. Later that year, he began a mock feud with indie rock group the Decemberists over the subject of who was the first to challenge fans to create a green screen video; the fake conflict culminated in a guitar solo competition on the show's final episode of the year, featuring guest appearances from guitarist Peter Frampton and Dr. Henry Kissinger. Colbert later recalled it as the show's \\"craziest\\" moment, changing the way the staff viewed the program: \\"Because you realize the character believes anything he thinks, says, [or] cares about is important, anything fits on the show. [...] That is the show where we said, oh, there is unlimited open field running.\\" Drill sergeant SFC Chantz correcting PVT Colbert at Fort Jackson In February 2007, Ben & Jerry's unveiled a new ice cream flavor in honor of Stephen Colbert, named Stephen Colbert's AmeriCone Dream. All proceeds were donated to charity through the Stephen Colbert AmeriCone Dream Fund, which distributed the money to various causes. In June 2007, Colbert broke his left wrist while performing his warm-up for the show. It was the subject of an extended bit on the program, including the creation of the \\"Wriststrong\\" wrist band, based on Lance Armstrong's \\"Livestrong\\" wrist band, which donated all proceeds to the Yellow Ribbon Fund. Colbert remained on the air without writers during the Writers Guild of America strike in 2007‚Äì08. Colbert modified the pronunciation of the show's name, pronouncing both of the formerly elided final \\"t\\"s (); a similar move was made by The Daily Show which returned to air as A Daily Show. During this period, he staged a mock feud between himself, Jon Stewart, and Late Night host Conan O'Brien over who made Republican Presidential candidate Mike Huckabee. In 2008, Colbert made a series of jokes directed at various towns in the United States named \\"Canton\\", with many attracting negative responses from each respective area's local government and residents. The same year, the show filmed a tongue-in-cheek Christmas special titled A Colbert Christmas: The Greatest Gift of All!. In 2009, Colbert filmed a series of four episodes for the troops in Baghdad, Iraq. He had a suit tailored for him in the Army Combat Uniform pattern and went through an abbreviated version of the Army's basic training regimen. On the first of the four episodes, Colbert had his head shaved on stage by General Ray Odierno who was jokingly \\"ordered\\" to do so by President Barack Obama, who appeared on the episode via a pre-recorded segment from the White House. Later years President Barack Obama guest-hosting the show in 2014. In 2010, while in character, Colbert appeared before judiciary subcommittee hearing on the issue of farm workers and immigration. The New Yorker used Colbert's testimony before Congress as an example of the \\"third\\" Colbert: \\"Colbert was thoughtful and sincere‚Äîand had ruined the whole thing. By speaking honestly, he had become the very thing he was mocking, a celebrity testifying before Congress.\\" Beginning in June 2011, the show created a long- running gag that involved Colbert starting his own actual super PAC, Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow, described by the character as \\"100 percent legal and at least 10 percent ethical.\\" In 2012, Colbert interviewed illustrator/author Maurice Sendak, who managed to get him to break character; show staff and Colbert himself retrospectively labeled the segment one of the show's more memorable moments. The Los Angeles Times called the September 2013 interview with intelligence official Philip Mudd his \\"most awkward interview\\", stating Mudd \\"could barely disguise his contempt\\" for Colbert. President Barack Obama guested during the show's final month, in a show taped from George Washington University in Washington, D.C.; Obama sat in Colbert's seat and presided over \\"The W√∏rd\\" segment. The final episode aired on December 18, 2014. In the episode Stephen becomes immortal after accidentally killing \\"Grimmy\\" during the opening of the segment of \\"Cheating Death with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, D.F.A.\\". This leads to Stephen singing \\"We'll Meet Again\\" in its entirety along with a large group of famous friends including Jon Stewart, Jeff Daniels, Sam Waterston, Big Bird, Charlie Rose, Terry Gross, Keith Olbermann, Tom Brokaw, Alan Alda, Yo Yo Ma, Ken Burns, Cyndi Lauper, Patrick Stewart, Randy Newman, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Henry Kissinger, Alex Trebek, Mandy Patinkin, Lesley Stahl, George Lucas, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Gloria Steinem, Elijah Wood, Jake Tapper, Bob Costas, Smaug and Cookie Monster.https://mashable.com/2014/12/19/colbert-report-finale-celeb- list/#jzeWmvWo4iq2 Reception =Critical response= Initial reviews Reviews of The Colbert Report upon its 2005 premiere were positive, although critics were generally skeptical that the character could extend beyond one season without growing tiresome. While positively reviewing the program as a whole, Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune echoed these sentiments: \\"The biggest question hanging over The Colbert Report is whether the show‚Äôs sendup of the pomposity and fear-mongering of cable news blowhards will be as appealing in the long term.\\" Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post- Intelligencer summarized the show's early reaction: \\"Critics and bloggers either loved the premiere or declared themselves to be unmoved, but that's the standard reaction after any late-night program's debut. A truer measure will be seen in coming weeks, after the hype wears off and the ratings lose their exuberance.\\" Gilbert Cruz of Entertainment Weekly noted that \\"Colbert proves that the line between serious TV journalism and utter nonsense is a very thin one indeed.\\" Heather Havrilesky of Salon was effusive, remarking, \\"Not only does Colbert maintain his persona without skipping a beat throughout the entire show, but he‚Äôs got great comic timing, the show‚Äôs writers are brilliant, and the whole thing is pure foolish, bizarre, idiotic fun.\\" Barry Garron of The Hollywood Reporter dubbed it an \\"auspicious debut\\", writing, \\"The new show dovetails nicely with its lead-in to present a solid hour of skewered news and punctured pomposity.\\" Variety Brian Lowry commented that the show had an \\"impressive start with a topnotch premiere followed by a respectable second outing.\\" Paul Brownfield of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"In the run-up to the show it all sounded a bit hard to get your head around, but in the flesh the show zinged, at least this first week.\\" The Boston Globe Matthew Gilbert praised the show's wordplay, summarizing, \\"Colbert's a clever creation, and a necessary one, and he deserves an opportunity to offend as many people as possible with his pompous blather.\\" Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times commented that the show was a welcome addition to the Comedy Central lineup, remarking, \\"What puts Mr. Colbert over the top is that he is not just impersonating well known television personalities, he also uses parody to score larger points about politics and the press.\\" Nevertheless, there were more negative reviews: USA Today Robert Bianco opined that the show \\"tried too hard\\", writing, \\"Unfortunately, in just two weeks on the air, this half-hour spoof of a no-spin-zone type show has already stretched Colbert's character and the artifice that supports it past its natural breaking point.\\" Later reviews The New Yorker remarked that the show remained funny throughout its entire run. The Colbert Report currently scores favorable reviews, with 65/100 on Metacritic (first season), while its viewers' ranking on the site is higher at 8.7/10. In a 2009 academic analysis of the show's popularity, Temple University researcher, Heather LaMarre found that the show appealed to both liberals and conservatives, concluding, \\"there was no significant difference between the groups in thinking Colbert was funny, but conservatives were more likely to report that Colbert only pretends to be joking and genuinely meant what he said while liberals were more likely to report that Colbert used satire and was not serious when offering political statements\\". Malcolm Gladwell discussed LaMarre's findings in his Revisionist History podcast, \\"The Satire Paradox\\" (2016).Malcolm Gladwell, \\"The Satire Paradox\\" (Transcript), Simon Says. URL accessed February 14, 2018. =Ratings= The ratings of The Colbert Report, from its premiere, benefited from the lead-in The Daily Show provides, which at the time of the show's debut averaged 1.3 million viewers per night. Comedy Central had previously struggled to produce a hit program on par with The Daily Show, and were counting on Colbert after a string of failures. The Colbert Report drew 1.13 million viewers for its premiere episode, 47 percent greater than the average for that time slot over the previous four weeks, and 98 percent of the viewership of The Daily Show, which had Comedy Central's second-largest viewership. Averaged over its opening week, The Report had 1.2 million viewers per episode, more than double the average for the same time the previous year, when the time slot was occupied by Too Late with Adam Carolla. The show regularly began attracting over one million viewers with near immediacy. The show also drew more young men, a powerful demographic, than other late-night hosts (at that time, Jay Leno, David Letterman, and Conan O'Brien). Within a year, The Colbert Report began averaging 1.5 million viewers per night. In early 2008, in the midst of the writer's strike, Colbert posted an eleven- percent gain over its averages from the following fall. From 2012 to 2013, viewership decreased from 1.2 million to 1.1 million. In 2013, The Colbert Report was the second most-watched late-night talk show (behind The Daily Show) among the demographic of adults 18‚Äì49, beating competition The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in that demographic for the first time. That year, The Colbert Report attracted $52.1 million in advertising for an audience whose median age was 39.4, about a year younger than The Daily Show. In 2014, the final year of the show's run, ratings were down three percent (coinciding with a general ratings slide for cable television). The series finale on December 18, 2014 was watched by 2.4 million viewers, making it the most watched episode ever in the show's history. The finale was the most watched cable program of the night in its time slot, beating The Daily Show which was seen by two million viewers. =Awards= Stephen Colbert and the crew of The Colbert Report at the 67th Annual Peabody Awards The Colbert Report received numerous awards and accolades throughout its run. The show was nominated for four Emmy Awards in its inaugural year, but lost to The Daily Show. The show was nominated each year for the rest of its run for Outstanding Variety, Music, or Comedy Series, but lost each time to The Daily Show until 2013, when it broke the latter program's winning streak, dubbed the longest in Emmy history. Colbert subsequently referenced his win on his program as the conclusion of Stewart's \\"reign of terror.\\" It also won the award the following year, and was nominated in the same category in 2015. The show received two Peabody Awards, recognizing its excellence in news and entertainment.68th Annual Peabody Awards, May 2008.71st Annual Peabody Awards, May 2012. It also won two Grammy Awards, one for Best Comedy Album for the soundtrack to the special A Colbert Christmas, and later for Best Spoken Word Album for the audiobook to America Again. Colbert and Stewart's Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear was nominated for four Daytime Emmy awards in 2011, including the Outstanding Special Class Special category and the Outstanding Special Class Writing category. =Racism controversy= In March 2014, the show attracted controversy when Colbert used a \\"fatuously fake parody stereotype character, 'Ching-Chong Ding-Dong,'\\" to \\"satirize knee-jerk mockery\\" of Asian dialect. The name had been used before without incident, but the show's official Twitter account ‚Äî run by an unknown individual ‚Äî tweeted the remarks without context, leading to wide outrage over social media, including a hashtag campaign, \\"#CancelColbert\\", that was a worldwide trending topic for over 24 hours, thanks in-part by Colbert himself helping make it go viral for his show. Legacy The New Yorker wrote that \\"Colbert has made vital observations about the American political system, particularly about the sordid role that money plays within it. The Colbert Report and the Daily Show [...] have changed the way that young liberals of a certain class think and talk about civic culture.\\" Colbert at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear in 2010, which attracted over 215,000 people. The show also coined another word, wikiality, that means \\"reality as decided on majority rule.\\" Viewers of the show also coined a word, freem, based on its inclusion in the show's opening sequence; the word refers to \\"'freedom' without having to 'do' anything ‚Äî without any responsibility or action.\\" In response to the \\"Better Know a District\\" segment, Rahm Emanuel, then the Democratic Caucus chair, instructed incoming freshmen not to do appearances on the show in 2007. In 2008, East Carolina University associate professor Jason Bond named a species of trapdoor spider Aptostichus stephencolberti in honor of Stephen Colbert. The \\"Colbert Bump\\" is defined, connotatively by the Report, as an increase in popularity of a person (author, musician, politician, etc.) or thing (website, etc.) as a result of appearing as a guest on or (in the case of a thing) being mentioned on the show. For example, if a politician appears on The Colbert Report, they may become more popular with certain voters and thus are more likely to be elected. According to the American Political Science Association, contributions to Democratic politicians rose 40% for 30 days after an appearance on the show. Magazines such as GQ, Newsweek, and Sports Illustrated have all had sales spikes when Colbert appeared on their covers.Should Vanity Fair Put Stephen Colbert on the Cover?  VF Daily  Vanity Fair Viewers of The Colbert Report were on numerous occasions cited as being more knowledgeable about current events than traditional news viewers. In April 2007, a Pew Research Center report cited both Colbert and The Daily Show viewers as more well-informed than those who gathered their information via newspapers, television news and radio. Colbert's Super PAC coverage was widely lauded, and studies later found that this coverage was more effective than traditional news programs at educating the audience on campaign finance. He was awarded a Peabody Award for the parody, which was described as an \\"innovative means of teaching American viewers about the landmark court decision\\". The Annenberg Public Policy Center reported in 2014 that the Colbert Super PAC segments increased viewers' knowledge of PAC and 501(c)(4) campaign finance regulation more successfully than other types of news media. International distribution Outside the United States, The Colbert Report was shown in Canada on the cable service The Comedy Network, simultaneously with its original U.S. broadcast (beginning a few weeks after the series debuted). Episodes would also air in Canada on traditional over-the-air broadcaster CTV, one hour after their appearance on The Comedy Network. On September 22, 2014, due to The Comedy Network's acquisition of Canadian rights to Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the program began airing on M3 and did so for the remainder of the show's run. It airs on The Comedy Channel in Australia, Comedy Central in New Zealand, and on Maxxx in the Philippines. , The Colbert Report has also been broadcast in Africa on DSTV's version of Comedy Central. It aired on FX in the United Kingdom until they decided not to renew their contract in May 2009. In Portugal, it airs on Sic Radical.

It is a celebration of the Galician language and its literature which was inaugurated by the Royal Galician Academy (Real Academia Galega) in 1963. This celebration has taken place on May 17 each year since 1963. In the year 1991 Galician Literature Day was declared a public holiday in all Galicia. The first celebration took place in 1963 to commemorate the centenary of Cantares gallegos, the first work written in the Galician language by Rosal√≠a de Castro (1837-1885), who later became one of the most important poets in the history of Galicia. Cantares gallegos was first published on May 17, 1863. Since 1963, each Galician Literature Day has been dedicated to a different writer in the Galician language. Only writers who have been dead for at least ten years are eligible, and the choice is made by the Royal Galician Academy. There is only one precedent of a \\"shared\\" Day: in 1998, the day was dedicated to Mart√≠n Codax, Xoh√°n de Cangas and Mendinho, together with the authors of the medieval songs (cantigas).

Thompson is one of the most recognised names and voices in the British folk rock movement of the 1970s and 1980s, in collaboration with fellow British folk rock musician, guitarist Richard Thompson, to whom she was married for ten years, and later as a solo artist. Biography =Early years= Born in Hackney, London, she moved with her family to Glasgow, Scotland, at the age of six. Actor Brian Pettifer is her brother. Around 1966 she started singing in folk clubs, and in 1967 began studying modern languages at the University of London, but dropped out after four months. She changed her name to Linda Peters. By day she sang advertising jingles, including one with Manfred Mann. She recorded the Bob Dylan song \\"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\\", released as an MGM single in 1968 by Paul McNeill and Linda Peters, McNeill being another friend of Sandy Denny and Alex Campbell. They released a second single as Paul and Linda in 1969 on Page One, featuring the John D. Loudermilk song \\"You're Taking My Bag\\". She met Richard Thompson in 1969, but they did not record together until 1972. Her reputation led to her being invited to join the Bunch, a loose supergroup of folk rock luminaries including former Fairport Convention members Sandy Denny, Richard Thompson, and Ashley Hutchings which recorded an album called Rock On. This was a set of 1950s rock and roll classics. A single was released from the album: The Everly Brothers' hit \\"When Will I Be Loved\\", which was a duet by Linda and Sandy. A second single was released soon afterwards \\"The Loco-Motion\\", sung by Linda alone. Two versions exist, one with \\"Sweet Little Rock 'n' Roller\\" as the B-side and in a picture sleeve, another with \\"Don't Be Cruel\\" on the flip. Later in 1972 Linda and Richard were backing singers on Sandy Denny's solo album Sandy. Linda teamed up with Simon Nicol and Richard (after he had left Fairport Convention). Calling themselves \\"Hokey Pokey\\", they toured as a trio. Linda and Richard married in 1972. Linda sang on Fairport's album Rosie (1973), credited as Linda Peters. The next album, I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight (1974) was credited to \\"Richard and Linda Thompson\\". Two albums followed in 1975: Hokey Pokey and Pour Down Like Silver. Richard had started to take an interest in Sufism, a mystical form of Islam, in 1973. After the tour, the couple went to a Sufi commune in East Anglia for six months, then to another in Maida Vale. Richard announced that he would never play again, but returned after three years. Linda found herself in a community where all the food was prepared by the women. In her words, the members were \\"white middle-class people trying to punish themselves, and everybody else. It taught me a lot. To stay away from sects, mostly.\\" =Lights on and off again= Their come-back album was called First Light (1978). Richard's writing has a strong thread of disdain for fame, wealth and worldly values and attacks political hypocrisy, often in wildly abstract metaphors. Sunnyvista followed in 1979, and Shoot Out the Lights in 1982. Shoot Out The Lights was surprisingly successful in America, and the Thompsons, despite the fractured state of their relationship, were offered a long and lucrative tour of the U.S. Simon Nicol described the final tour, in the summer of 1982, as being \\"like walking on a tightrope\\", and that as a result the first thing he did on stage was \\"look for the exit\\". The couple had separated by the time that the American tour started, and were barely speaking to each other. The penultimate date of the tour was in Los Angeles. Linda then went to stay with her friend Linda Ronstadt. The tapes were finally released in October 2010 in the Shoot Out The Lights box set, although a version of \\"Walking on a Wire\\" from earlier in the tour is on the Free Reed RT boxed set. When Richard left Linda, she had just given birth to their third child, Kamila. =Linda alone= Linda lost her voice for the next two years as a result of spasmodic dysphonia. She made a new start in 1984, singing with \\"The Home Service\\" at the National Theatre's production of medieval mystery plays and in 1985 she released her solo album One Clear Moment, then fell silent for eleven years. One song from the album, called \\"Telling Me Lies\\", written with Betsy Cook, was recorded by Emmylou Harris, Dolly Parton, and Linda Ronstadt for their Trio album in 1987. The recording was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Country Song category. Linda retired from music to run an antique jewellery shop in Bond Street, central London. She married Steve Kenis, an American who was an agent for recording artists. In 1985 Richard married U.S. folk club organiser, Nancy Covey. A compilation of Linda's earlier work, Dreams Fly Away (1996), included both previously released songs and alternate versions of some of her better-known songs. It was received politely but did not sell well. In 1999, Linda's mother died. This provoked an outpouring of sorrow and regenerated her determination to sing. Linda was diagnosed with spasmodic dysphonia, preventing her from singing. A temporary cure was found. By having botox injected into her throat, she could regain her normal singing voice for a few months. Give Me a Sad Song (2001) was positively reviewed. In 2002, she released a new CD, Fashionably Late, which featured several family members, including her son Teddy Thompson and daughter Kamila Thompson, as well as an appearance on one song by Richard Thompson. Linda appeared along with her son Teddy, her friends The McGarrigles, and Kate McGarrigle's children Martha Wainwright and Rufus Wainwright (amongst others) in Hal Wilner's \\"Came So Far For Beauty\\" tribute concerts to the music of Leonard Cohen from 2003 to 2006. Linda sang the Cohen songs \\"A Thousand Kisses Deep\\" and \\"Alexandra Leaving\\". She appeared again with Teddy Thompson with The McGarrigles and Wainwrights for some of their family concerts, including the McGarrigle Christmas shows. In 2007, Linda released yet another set of original songs and covers, Versatile Heart. Like Fashionably Late, this too was primarily a collaboration with son Teddy Thompson, and the CD also features a supporting cast of family and friends. The CD was well received in the press. The CD opens and closes with two arrangements of a Teddy Thompson instrumental piece, \\"Stay Bright\\", the first an acoustic version, and the second a version for string quartet arranged by famed Nick Drake collaborator Robert Kirby. She contributed vocals to the Primal Scream album Beautiful Future (2008), on the track \\"Over & Over\\". Linda and Richard Thompson performed a duet at 12 June 2010 Meltdown Festival tribute concert to Kate McGarrigle, which Richard coordinated. Linda's fourth solo album, Won't Be Long Now, was released on 15 October 2013. The album features compositions and backing vocals from Teddy Thompson and his sisters as well as guitar work by Richard Thompson. Linda appears on the album Family (2014) by the band Thompson (named for all the Thompsons that appear) having written two songs for the project. The album was produced by her son Teddy Thompson and features Richard Thompson and The Rails, who are Linda's daughter Kamila Thompson and her husband James Walbourne, as well as other related musicians, including Walbourne's brother and Richard Thompson's son from his second marriage.

However, because softer and more primitive wickets meant backup bowlers were often unnecessary, Sharpe could never get into form once William Lockwood began developing as a bowler late in 1891, and his county career was, for his time, quite short despite some notable successes in Australia. Though born in Nottinghamshire to the cricketer Samuel Sharpe, Sharpe was overlooked by his native county in the 1880s when bowlers such as Shaw and Attewell could do everything needed to win matches, and he qualified for Surrey in the late 1880s. He emerged in 1889 with 5 for 5 against Oxford University, but was always overshadowed by Lohmann in purely county cricket. However, in 1890 Sharpe developed so much that he took 102 wickets in county matches for just 12.08 each ‚Äì beating Lohmann in the averages. Because of his superb work in the \\"short spells of fine weather\\" (Wisden 1891) it was thought Sharpe was the best hard-wicket bowler in England. In 1891, Sharpe fully maintained his reputation for three months, with 9 for 47 on a bumpy wicket against Middlesex being outstanding, but he fell off in August as Lockwood showed some deadly form. However, his reputation on hard wickets meant he was already an automatic choice for the 1891/1892 Ashes tour and he worked remarkably hard ‚Äì often with considerable success, as when he took 6 for 84 off 51 overs in the First Test at the MCG. In 1892, though, Sharpe could never get into form and he was dropped from the Surrey side long before the season ended. Though he was recalled in 1893 when Richardson was injured, he did nothing and Surrey released him at the end of the year. He played for Nottinghamshire a couple of times in 1894, but any hopes he would strengthen their weakening bowling were destroyed very quickly: he took only ten wickets at 28.40 under conditions tremendously favourable to bowlers, and retired at the then-remarkably young age of 28. Sharpe bowled fast-medium and could make the ball break back to an unusual degree on hard pitches. His extra-fast yorker was often deadly. Having lost an eye, he had no pretensions as a batsman, but he was quite active in the field for a player in that time.

It is a hollow in the ground in which water may collect or in which a deposit of salt remains after water has evaporated. The 120-kilometre-long (75-mile-long) dry lakebed and its surroundings are protected as Etosha National Park, Namibia's second-largest wildlife park, covering 22,270 km2. The pan is mostly dry but after a heavy rain it will acquire a thin layer of water, which is heavily salted by the mineral deposits on the surface. Location and description Location of the pan in Namibia Etosha, meaning 'Great White Place' is made of a large mineral pan. The area exhibits a characteristic white and greenish surface, which spreads over 4,800Encyclop√¶dia Britannica ‚Äì Etosha Pan. km2. The pan is believed to have developed through tectonic plate activity over about ten million years. Around 16,000 years ago, when ice sheets were melting across the land masses of the Northern Hemisphere, a wet climate phase in southern Africa filled Etosha Lake. Today however the Etosha Pan is mostly dry clay mud split into hexagonal shapes as it dries and cracks, and is seldom seen with even a thin sheet of water covering it. The first image shows the inflow of the Ekuma River. The surface flow here was sufficient to reach the pan, but insufficient to inundate it beyond the inlet bay. The lower image records the same inlet on the north shore, this time dry. It is assumed that the Kunene River fed the lake at that time, but tectonic plate movements over time caused a change in river direction, resulting in the lake running dry and leaving a salt pan. Now the Ekuma River, the Oshigambo River and the Omurambo Ovambo River are the sole seasonal source of water for the lake. Typically, little river water or sediment reaches the dry lake because water seeps into the riverbed along its course, reducing discharge along the way. History In the colonial era, the first non-Africans to explore this area were the Europeans Charles John Andersson and Francis Galton in 1851. Flora and fauna Desiccated soil of the Etosha pan bush elephant south of the lake The surrounding area is dense mopane woodland which is occupied by herds of elephants on the south side of the lake. Mopane trees are common throughout south-central Africa, and host the mopane worm, which is the larval form of the moth Gonimbrasia belina, and an important source of protein for rural communities. The salt desert supports very little plant life except for the blue-green algae that gives the Etosha its characteristic colouring, and grasses like Sporobolus spicatus which quickly grow in the wet mud following a rain. Away from the lake there is grassland that supports grazing animals. This harsh dry land with little vegetation and small amounts of salty water, when it is present at all, supports little wildlife all year round but is used by a large number of migratory birds. The hypersaline pan supports brine shrimp and a number of extremophile micro-organisms tolerant of the high saline conditions.(C.Michael Hogan. 2010.) In particularly rainy years the Etosha pan becomes a lake approximately 10 cm in depth and becomes a breeding ground for flamingos, which arrive in their thousands, and great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus). The surrounding savanna is home to thousands of mammals that will visit the pan and surrounding waterholes when there is water. These include quite large numbers of zebra (Equus quagga), blue wildebeest (Connocheatus taurinus), gemsbok, eland and springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) as well as black rhinoceros, elephants, lions, leopards, and giraffe. Threats and protection The Etosha pan is completely within the national park and is designated as a Ramsar wetland of international importance and a World Wildlife Fund ecoregion (Etosha Pan halophytics).

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees from 1955 through 1966. Batting and throwing right- handed, he formed a top double play combination with fellow Yankee infielders Clete Boyer and Tony Kubek. He became the only World Series Most Valuable Player to be selected from the losing team when he won the award for his play in the 1960 World Series. In 1962, he led the American League (AL) in hits with 209 and snared a line drive off the bat of Willie McCovey to win the 1962 World Series for the Yankees. Born in Sumter, South Carolina, Richardson grew up desiring to play for the Yankees after seeing the 1942 film The Pride of the Yankees. Drawing interest from 11 out of 16 MLB teams, he signed with the Yankees and made his debut for them two years later. Earning a regular spot on the roster in 1957, Richardson reached his first All-Star Game that year. He lost starts at second base to Gil McDougald later in the year, though, and was mostly a reserve player in 1958. It was not until 1959 that he would become a regular at second base. In 1960, he was named the World Series MVP. Though the Yankees lost the Series in seven games to the Pittsburgh Pirates, Richardson batted .367 with 12 runs batted in (RBI). He won the next two World Series, ending the 1962 series by catching McCovey's line drive in what The Sporting News called baseball's 13th most memorable play in 1999. Richardson led the AL in hits that year, with 209. From 1961 to 1965, Richardson won five straight Gold Glove Awards at second base. He played in the All-Star Game every year from 1962 through 1966. In 1963, he won the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, and he played in the World Series in 1963 and 1964. His last two years in the major leagues, he had 164 and 153 hits, respectively. Though only 31 after the 1966 season, Richardson retired to spend more time with his family. The Yankees held a special day for him towards the end of the season, making Richardson the 10th Yankee to be so honored. After his playing career, Richardson coached college teams for several years. He led the University of South Carolina to its first College World Series in 1975 and laid the groundwork for their later success. In 1986, he led Coastal Carolina University's baseball team to a Big South Conference championship, and he coached at Liberty University from 1987 through 1990. Richardson ran for the United States House of Representatives in South Carolina's 5th congressional district as a Republican in 1976 but lost to incumbent Kenneth Holland. A Christian, Richardson was involved in many Christian organizations during and after his career. He spoke at the White House in 1970 as a representative of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, appeared in five Billy Graham Crusades, and frequently speaks at churches and other organizations. Early life Richardson was the middle child of Robert Sr. and Debbie Richardson of Sumter, South Carolina. He had two sisters, Inez (older) and Willie Ann (younger). Richardson Marble and Granite Works in Sumter was managed by Robert Sr., who also owned some of the interest in the company. Ever since seeing Pride of the Yankees, released in 1942, Richardson had dreamed of playing for the New York Yankees. Growing up, he practiced his baseball skills with Harry Stokes, a boy in his neighborhood seven years his senior who would play catch with him. Richardson played on a local YMCA/Salvation Army team at the age of ten. Later, he played on ballclubs sponsored by the local Kiwanis Club and American Legion. On the American Legion team, Richardson's coach was Fred Hutchinson, who would later manage the Cincinnati Reds when Richardson faced them in the 1961 World Series. Hutchinson and Richardson became American Legion champions in 1952, Richardson's junior year of high school. Hutchinson also coached Richardson at Edmunds High School. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Georgia Tech University offered Richardson baseball scholarships, and 11 out of 16 Major League Baseball (MLB) teams showed interest in him as well. Mayo Smith, manager of the Norfolk Tars, a team in the Class B Piedmont League and an affiliate of the New York Yankees, scouted Richardson for New York, as did Bill Harris. Ultimately, Richardson decided to forgo college and sign with the Yankees out of high school (though he later earned a degree in accounting). Career =1953-56: Playing in the minor leagues, debuting with the Yankees= Richardson started his minor league career in 1953 with the Norfolk Tars of the Class B Piedmont League, travelling by bus to Norfolk from Sumter with $85 in coins friends and family had given him. After Richardson batted just .211 in his first 27 games with the Tars, the Yankees assigned him to a Class D team, the Olean Yankees of the PONY League. With Olean, he batted .412 in 32 games and hit his first home run. In 1954, Richardson was promoted, heading up to the Class A Binghamton Triplets of the Eastern League without having to return to Norfolk. Spending the whole year in Binghamton, he ranked among the Eastern League leaders in games (141, tied for first), runs (81, fifth), hits (171, first), doubles (29, second to Clyde Parris's 40), and batting average (.310, second to Parris's .313). For his contributions, Richardson was named the Eastern League's Most Valuable Player (MVP). Richardson spent most of spring training with the Yankees in 1955 but was sent to the Class AAA Denver Bears of the American Association to start the year. In 119 games with the Bears, he batted .296 with 146 hits, 99 runs scored, 21 doubles, 12 triples, six home runs, and 59 RBI. When Gil McDougald found himself on the receiving end of a line drive during batting practice in August 1955, the Yankees called up Richardson. He debuted on August 5, 1955, getting his first hit against Hall of Famer Jim Bunning in a 3‚Äì0 victory over the Detroit Tigers. In the field, he was a \\"nervous wreck\\" as he later described, but no balls were hit to him. He started four games at second base in three days (including an August 7 doubleheader), then entered three games in the late innings at shortstop before getting sent to the minor leagues on August 15 to make room for a pitcher returning from the disabled list. For some reason, he was sent to the Richmond Virginians of the Class AAA International League this time, with whom he finished the season. Called up again in September, he appeared in four more games for the Yankees before the end of the year. In 1956, Richardson started the season with the Yankees. However, he only appeared in five games for them, batting .143 before getting sent back to Denver May 13. With the Bears, he ranked among the American Association leaders in batting average (.328, third), runs scored (102, sixth), hits (175, fourth), doubles (30, ninth), and triples (12, tied with Willie Kirkland for second behind Larry Raines's 14). =1957-59: Becoming a full-time player= Richardson made the team in 1957 and soon took over the second base job from Billy Martin. The Yankees' volatile infielder had injured himself in a deliberate golf cart collision with Mickey Mantle in spring training, then caused further trouble by getting into a highly publicized brawl at the Copacabana Club in May before getting traded to the Kansas City Athletics in June. Richardson proved a quieter sort of character, if not a great hitter in 1957; manager Casey Stengel said, \\"Look at him. He doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke, he doesn't chew, he doesn't stay out late, and he still can't hit .250.\\" His fielding was better; Louis Effrat of The New York Times wrote June 25, \\"He has thrilled the fans with his great stops and catches... no one gets rid of the ball quicker [on double plays].\\" Actually, Richardson's .331 average trailed only Mantle among the Yankees on June 25, and he made his first appearance in the All-Star Game that year. However, he batted .188 over the rest of the year, finishing the season with a .256 mark and 78 hits in 305 at bats. By September, Richardson was losing a lot of starts to Jerry Coleman at second base. Even so, Stengel waited until the last minute to decide whether Coleman or Richardson would start at second base in the 1957 World Series against the Milwaukee Braves. Ultimately, Stengel chose Coleman, who started all seven games for the Yankees as Richardson was limited to two appearances as a pinch-runner and defensive replacement. The Yankees lost the Series in seven games. Coleman retired following the 1957 season, and Richardson began 1958 as the Yankees' starting second baseman. After batting .203 through the Yankees' first 18 games, he missed 20 in a row as McDougald began getting the starts at second. Richardson started at second from June 5 through June 12 but thereafter spent most of the season on the bench until September, when he again got a few starts at second base. In 73 games (182 at bats), he batted .247 with 18 runs scored and 45 hits. Richardson considered quitting baseball that season because of his struggles, but Ralph Houk, the Yankees' general manager and Richardson's former manager at Denver, convinced him to keep playing. In the 1958 World Series, again against the Braves, Richardson finished three games for the Yankees at third base and also started Game 4 at third, though he was hitless in two at bats before getting pinch-hit for in the seventh by Elston Howard. However, he became a World Series champion for the first time, as this year the Yankees defeated the Braves in seven games. Richardson began 1959 as the Yankees' shortstop; Effrat wrote, \\"[Richardson] is a tremendous fielder no matter where [the Yankees] play him.\\" He moved to second base on April 18 after McDougald suffered cracked knuckles, then returned to shortstop on April 29 when McDougald returned to the lineup. Only batting .232 through the season's first twenty games, he was benched after May 5 in favor of Tony Kubek. Bill Dickey, the hitting coach for the Yankees, worked with Richardson to improve his hitting. In 1959, Richardson switched to a heavier bat and tried swinging harder at pitches. Given the chance to start at second base again in mid-June, Richardson raised his batting average from .232 to .300 over six games with 11 hits in 18 at bats. He was on the roster for the second All-Star Game of the year and remained the starting second baseman the rest of the season. On July 25, 1959, Richardson and Fritz Brickell both hit their first major league home runs, Richardson's coming against Paul Foytack in a 9‚Äì8 victory over the Tigers. Batting .298 coming into the final game of the year, Richardson was the only Yankee with a chance at hitting .300. Stengel promised to remove him from the game if he got a hit in his first at bat (moving his batting average to .300). Richardson flew out to Albie Pearson in his first at bat but got hits in his next two at bats to move his average to .301, then was pinch-hit for in the eighth, preserving the mark. In 134 games (469 at bats), he had 53 runs scored, 141 hits, 18 doubles, six triples, two home runs (both against Foytack), and 33 RBI. His .301 average topped the Yankees and ranked sixth in the American League (AL), and he finished 18th in AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting after the season. =1960-62: Starring in the World Series= In 1960, Richardson remained the Yankees' starting second baseman all season. On April 30, June 30, and July 18, he had a season-high three hits. One of those hits on April 30 was his only home run of the year, against Arnie Portocarrero, in a 16‚Äì0 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. With the Yankees and Athletics tied 7‚Äì7 on May 6, Richardson singled against Bob Trowbridge, stole second base, moved to third on a groundout by Ryne Duren, then scored the winning run on a single by McDougald. Batting .208 through June 17, he hit .370 from June 18 through July 23, raising his season average to .273. Thereafter, he batted .215 to finish the year with a .252 mark. In 150 games (460 at bats), he had 45 runs scored, 116 hits, 12 doubles, three triples, and 26 RBI. The Yankees faced the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1960 World Series. Richardson went hitless in Game 1 but contributed three in Game 2, scoring three runs as well as the Yankees won 16‚Äì3. In Game 3, he came to bat in the first inning with the bases loaded against Clem Labine. Third base coach Frank Crosetti signaled him to bunt, but after running the count to two strikes, Richardson cancelled the plan. He remained at the plate long enough to run the at bat to a full count, then hit a grand slam to put the Yankees ahead 6‚Äì0. Up to bat with the bases loaded again in the fourth inning, he had a two-RBI single against Red Witt. His six RBI set a new record for most in a single World Series game. In Game 4, he had two hits and drove in another run, but the Yankees lost this one 3‚Äì2. After going hitless in Game 5, he hit two triples in Game 6, drove in three runs, and scored one in the Yankees' 12‚Äì0 rout of the Pirates to force Game 7. He scored a run in the sixth inning, led off the ninth with a single against Harvey Haddix, and scored another run, but New York lost the game 10‚Äì9. Though Pittsburgh second baseman Bill Mazeroski hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth to win the Series for Pittsburgh, it was Richardson who would be named the World Series MVP after hitting .367 with 12 RBI. He is the only World Series MVP who was playing for the losing team when he won the award. Sport Magazine gave him a new Corvette for his efforts. Since he had a growing family, Richardson traded the car for a Chevrolet station wagon. Houk took over from Stengel as the Yankee manager in 1961; he inserted Richardson either first or second into the batting order each game. On June 15, he had three hits and four RBI, including a three-run home run against Johnny Antonelli as the Yankees beat the Cleveland Indians 11‚Äì5. He had four RBI again in the second game of a doubleheader on July 9, including a three-run home run against Don Schwall, but the Yankees lost that game 9‚Äì6 to the Boston Red Sox. On August 17, he had three hits and scored three runs in a 5‚Äì3 victory over the Chicago White Sox. The Yankees lost 6‚Äì4 to the Los Angeles Angels on August 26, but Richardson had five hits in the game. Playing all 162 games for the Yankees, Richardson batted .261 with 80 runs scored, 17 doubles, five triples, three home runs, and 49 RBI. His 662 at bats were third in the AL (behind Brooks Robinson's 668 and Jake Wood's 663), and his 173 hits were fifth in the league. Defensively, he led the AL with 413 putouts and 136 double plays assisted in. Richardson finished 24th in MVP voting and won the Gold Glove at second base, the first of five straight he would win at the position. Richardson had no RBI in the 1961 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds but did bat .391, with nine hits in 23 at bats. He had three hits apiece in Games 1 and 4. In Game 4, he led off the seventh inning with a single against Jim Brosnan, advanced to second when Vada Pinson misplayed the ball, moved to third base on a wild pitch by Brosnan, and scored on a single by H√©ctor L√≥pez as the Yankees won 7‚Äì0. The Yankees defeated the Reds in five games, making Richardson a World Series champion for the second time. On June 9, 1962, against the Orioles, Richardson had four hits, including a two-run home run against Steve Barber that tied the game at two in the seventh; the Yankees went on to win 7‚Äì3. He was selected to both of the All-Star Games in 1962. With the Yankees trailing the Minnesota Twins 7‚Äì4 in the ninth inning on August 16, 1962, at Metropolitan Stadium, Richardson came up to the plate with the bases loaded. Before the at bat, Mantle told him, \\"See if you can hit one out. I'm not feeling too good today.\\" Richardson hit a home run to left field against Dick Stigman, the only grand slam of his career besides his one in the 1960 World Series. Though the hit put the Yankees ahead 8‚Äì7, they would lose the lead in the bottom of the ninth and lose in extra innings. Two days later, he had three hits and two runs scored, including a three-run home run against Orlando Pe√±a in an 11‚Äì7 victory over the Athletics. Against the Washington Senators on September 19, he had four hits, two runs scored, and an RBI in an 8‚Äì5 victory. Len Pasculi of the Society for American Baseball Research called 1962 his most productive year, as he batted .302 with eight home runs, 59 RBI, and 11 stolen bases in 161 games. He led the AL in hits (209) and at bats (692). Richardson also ranked among the league leaders in runs scored (99, tied for fourth with Carl Yastrzemski), batting average (.302, seventh), and doubles (38, fourth). He finished second to Mantle in AL MVP voting. The Yankees faced the San Francisco Giants in the 1962 World Series. Richardson batted a mere .148 in this Series, though he did have two hits and two runs scored in the Yankees' 5‚Äì3 triumph of Game 5. However, his glove would provide one of the most famous memories of the series. In Game 7, the Yankees had the only run of the game going into the bottom of the ninth inning, needing three outs to win the series. Matty Alou led off with a single, however, and after two strikeouts, Mays doubled to put the tying run (Alou) at third with future Hall of Famer Willie McCovey coming to bat. If Mays scored, the Giants would win the series. McCovey hit a screaming line drive up the middle which likely would have scored both runs had it made it out of the infield. Hardly moving from his position, Richardson snared the ball for the third out, winning the Series for the Yankees. \\"People often suggest that I was out of position on that play,\\" Richardson remembered later. \\"But McCovey hit two hard ground balls to me earlier in the Series, so I played where I thought he would hit the ball.\\" McCovey still had bad memories of it years later. \\"I broke in with a 4-for-4 my rookie year against a Hall of Fame pitcher, Robin Roberts,\\" he recalled. \\"I hit more grand slams [18] than anybody in National League history. I hit more home runs [521] than any lefthanded hitter in the National League. But that out is what many people remember about me....I would rather be remembered as the guy who hit the ball six inches over Bobby Richardson's head.\\" Sporting News ranked the catch the 13th most memorable moment in baseball history in 1999, and Charles Schulz famously referenced it in a Peanuts comic strip, where Charlie Brown yells, \\"Why couldn‚Äôt McCovey have hit the ball just three feet higher?\\" =1963-66: Extending his streaks= Richardson in 1963. On April 23, 1963, Richardson had three hits, two RBI, and two runs scored in a 7‚Äì6 victory over the Senators. His father suffered a stroke in May, then died on July 17. Richardson missed 11 games during the year visiting him and helping get his affairs in order. He had a season high of four hits in a game twice in quick succession, on July 4 in the first game of a doubleheader and on July 6. He again represented the Yankees in the All- Star Game. On September 5, he singled against Steve Ridzik, stole second base, and scored on a Roger Maris hit due to an error by shortstop Ed Brinkman to tie a game with the Senators at 2 in the sixth inning. The Yankees went on to win 3‚Äì2 in 12 innings. After setting a career high with eight home runs the year before, Richardson hit three in 1963, all in Yankee losses. In 151 games, Richardson batted .265 with 72 runs scored and 48 RBI. He led the league in at bats (630) for the second year in a row, finished seventh with 167 hits and tied three other players for seventh with 15 stolen bases. Richardson again garnered AL MVP votes, finishing tenth this time. He won the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, given by Gehrig's Columbia University fraternity to the major leaguer who best demonstrates Gehrig's character. In Game 1 of the 1963 World Series, which the Los Angeles Dodgers swept in four games, Richardson struck out three times against Sandy Koufax‚Äîhis only three-strikeout game in 1,448 regular-season/World Series games. (Koufax would finish with 15 strikeouts, then a World Series single-game record.) Just that regular season, Richardson had struck out only 22 times in 630 at-bats. He had a mere three hits in the World Series but played each game; Richardson had now played in 23 straight World Series games dating back to 1960. On May 10, 1964, Richardson had five hits and scored three runs in a 12‚Äì2 victory over the Indians. Less than a month later, he had five hits on June 4 in a 9‚Äì7 victory over the Twins. He picked up his 1,000th hit on June 12 with a line drive to left field against Frank Baumann in a 6‚Äì1 victory over the White Sox in the first game of a doubleheader. The hit had proved difficult to come by for Richardson, who had put the ball in play seven times in his last two games without reaching base safely. Once again, he was selected to the All-Star Game. In the first game of a doubleheader on July 26, he had three hits, including a two-RBI single against Mickey Lolich and a solo home run against Terry Fox in an 11‚Äì6 victory over the Tigers. In 159 games, he batted .267 with four home runs, 50 RBI, and 11 stolen bases. For the third year in the row, he led the AL in at bats with 679. He also led the league with 148 singles, ranked third in the league with 181 hits (behind Tony Oliva's 217 and B. Robinson's 294), and tied Bob Allison for ninth in the AL with 90 runs scored. He finished 17th in AL MVP voting after the season. In the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, Richardson set a World Series record with 13 hits; this record has since been tied by Lou Brock and Marty Barrett in the 1968 and 1986 World Series, respectively. However, batting against Cardinal ace Bob Gibson with the Yankees trailing 7‚Äì5 in the ninth inning of Game 7, he popped out to Dal Maxvill for the final out of the Series. Richardson also had the dubious distinction of committing errors that affected the outcome of two games in the Series. In the sixth inning of Game 4, he mishandled Dick Groat's ground ball for a double play that would have ended the inning with no runs scoring; the error was followed one batter later by Ken Boyer's grand slam‚Äîthe four runs the Cardinals needed in defeating the Yankees 4‚Äì3. In the fifth inning of Game 5, he bobbled Curt Flood's double play ground ball, which also would have ended that inning without any damage. The Cardinals eventually scored twice in the inning, then won the game 5‚Äì2 on Tim McCarver's 10th inning, three-run home run. This was Richardson's final (of seven) World Series; he played all 30 World Series games from 1960 through 1964. On May 24, 1965, he had three hits, drove in two runs, and scored two more times in a 15‚Äì5 victory over Cleveland. After hitting into a fielder's choice on June 15, Richardson stole second base, then scored on a Maris single to put the Yankees up 1‚Äì0; however, the Yankees would lose the game 2‚Äì1 in the 10th inning. He was selected to the All-Star Game once again. On July 17, he had four hits and scored twice in a 5‚Äì4 victory over Washington. Five days later, his home run against Gary Peters put the Yankees ahead to stay in a 2‚Äì1 victory over the White Sox. On August 8, Ray Barker and Richardson hit back-to-back home runs against Denny McLain in a 6‚Äì5 victory over the Tigers. In 160 games, Richardson batted .247 with 76 runs scored, 164 hits, 28 doubles, six home runs, and 47 RBI. He finished 20th in AL MVP voting. Richardson had three hits and scored three times on May 25 in an 11‚Äì6 victory over the Angels. He hit a three-run double against Tommy John on June 2 to turn a 3‚Äì2 deficit into a 5‚Äì3 lead for the Yankees, who defeated the White Sox. Five days later, he had three hits, three runs scored, and three RBI, including a home run against John O'Donoghue in a 7‚Äì2 victory over the Indians. On June 29, he had five hits, one of which was a home run against Rollie Sheldon and was followed by two more by Mantle and Joe Pepitone in a 6‚Äì5 victory over the Red Sox. Richardson made the All-Star Game for the fifth year in a row, his seventh and final selection. He had four hits on August 15, including a home run against Lolich, as the Yankees defeated the Tigers 6‚Äì5. On September 11, he hit his last major league home run against John Wyatt in the 10th inning of a 4‚Äì2 victory over the Red Sox. He played in his final game on October 2, recording a hit and an RBI in a 2‚Äì0 victory over the White Sox. In 149 games, he batted .251 with 71 runs scored, 153 hits, 21 doubles, seven home runs, and 42 RBI. Though he was just 31 following the 1966 season, Richardson retired following the year. He had decided to retire after the 1965 season, but the Yankees convinced him to play one more season since Kubek had to retire due to injuries after the 1965 season. ‚ÄúI wanted to take the kids to school, help them with homework and watch or help coach their teams,‚Äù he explained. The Yankees honored him by declaring September 17 \\"Bobby Richardson Day,\\" making Richardson the tenth Yankee to be honored at the stadium with a special day. ‚ÄúHow lucky it has been for me to have been a Yankee. To God be the glory,\\" he said to the fans. =Legacy= Richardson racked up 1,432 hits in his career, with a lifetime batting average of .266, 34 home runs and 390 RBIs. Over his 12-year major league career, he scored 643 runs and stole 73 stolen bases. He also had 196 doubles and 37 triples. Defensively, he had an all-time fielding percentage of .979 at second base, and six seasons with 100 or more double plays turned. From 1961 to 1965, Richardson won five straight Gold Gloves at second base (not until Robinson Can√≥ in 2010 would another Yankee second baseman win a Gold Glove) while forming a top double play combination with shortstop and roommate Kubek. With the light-hitting but superb-fielding Yankee third baseman Clete Boyer, Richardson and Kubek gave the Yankees arguably the best defensive infield in baseball in the early 1960s. Richardson was also known for his ability to make contact. He struck out just 243 times, less than 5% of his plate appearances. A leadoff hitter who rarely missed a game, Richardson led the league in at bats three times. Following Martin's trade, he wore the uniform number 1 for the majority of his career (1958‚Äì1966). He led the league in at bats per strikeout three times during his career, 1964‚Äì1966. A skilled bunter, he led the league in sacrifice hits in 1962 and 1964. =Coaching= In the late 1960s, Paul Dietzel asked Richardson if he would become the head baseball coach for the University of South Carolina Gamecocks. Richardson told him no twice, as he was under a personal services contract with the Yankees. However, after Dietzel asked him a third time, Richardson secured permission from the Yankees to take the job, assuming the role in 1970. He would often pitch batting practice and drive the team bus for events. Richardson also tried to perform recruiting for the school but delegated the responsibility to others after he figured out \\"I wasn't going after the good players.\\" Under Richardson, Larry Keith of Sports Illustrated wrote, \\"South Carolina rarely bunts, often hits-and-runs and is always looking for the big inning.\\" Richardson led the Gamecocks to their first National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Tournament appearance in 1974, which set the stage for what would happen a year later in 1975 when South Carolina posted a 51‚Äì6‚Äì1 record and made the College World Series for the first time ever. They advanced all the way to the national championship game against Texas before losing 5‚Äì1 to the Longhorns. Richardson left South Carolina after the 1976 season, finishing his tenure with a 221‚Äì92‚Äì1 record and three NCAA Tournament appearances. Dennis Brunson of The Item said of Richardson's contributions, \\"Richardson had laid the groundwork for a program that would participate in the regionals in nine of the first 13 years under [new head coach [June] Raines and would play in the CWS four times.\\" In the 1980s, Richardson served as the baseball coach for two seasons (1985‚Äì86) at Coastal Carolina University in Conway, South Carolina, where he compiled a record of (61‚Äì38) and led the team to the Big South Conference championship in 1986. After the 1986 season, he resigned as head coach at Coastal Carolina to replace Al Worthington as the baseball coach at Liberty University. \\"I came here as athletic director under a different administration and [Chancellor] Ron [Eaglin] felt I should resign as athletic director and focus on baseball,\\" Richardson explained the decision to resign, with Eaglin saying the two had disagreed on a budget for the next season. Worthington, who had become Liberty's athletic director, served as pitching coach under Richardson, who coached the Flames for the next four seasons before retiring in 1990. 1976 political campaign In 1974, Nixon tried to convince Richardson to run as a Republican for the United States House of Representatives in South Carolina's 5th congressional district. Later, a private poll indicated he would have been the favorite had he run. Two years later, President Gerald Ford convinced Richardson to resign from his coaching position at the University of South Carolina to run for the seat. Richardson lost to incumbent Democrat Kenneth Holland by a narrow margin. Holland was aided by the strength of Jimmy Carter's winning campaign in South Carolina to hold off Richardson by a tally of 66,073 (51.4%) to 62,095 (48.3%). His campaign was supported by former baseball players Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Bob Feller, and Wilmer \\"Vinegar Bend\\" Mizell among others, though former roommate Kubek declined to campaign for him because Kubek was a Democrat. Personal life Betsy Dobson, Richardson's future spouse, met him at Grace Baptist Church of Sumter. In 1954, they went to a miniature golf course on their first date. Two years later, they were married. In an unusual move, Houk granted Richardson permission to leave the Denver Bears midseason to get married. The couple had three sons‚ÄìRobbie (born 7/2/57), Ron (7/13/58), and Rich (8/27/68)‚Äìand two daughters‚ÄìChristie (12/30/60) and Jeannie (1/21/64). In 1960, the Richardsons were renting a house in Ridgewood, New Jersey. They lived in Sumter during the offseason, where Richardson was a general secretary for the local Young Men's Christian Association and host for a radio sports show. Hunting is one of his favorite hobbies. He and teammate Bobby Shantz went gun shopping together in Kansas City in 1959, and fellow major-leaguer Billy O'Dell used to hunt with him in the offseason. His roommates when travelling with the Yankees at various times included Kubek and Shantz. Richardson is a Christian. During his time with the Yankees, he would organize church services for the team when they were travelling. Friend and teammate Mickey Mantle described him as a \\"clean-living, practicing Christian.\\" He was involved with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA) and the American Tract Society (ATS) during his career, as well as many charities. After his career, he continued to be involved with those organizations. He served as the president of the Baseball Chapel for 10 years, served on the President's Council for Physical Fitness, and earned the Golden Gavel Award from Toastmasters International. President Richard Nixon, who hosted church services at the White House each week of his presidency, invited the FCA to speak on October 18, 1970. One of four representatives, Richardson spoke on Jesus and the rich young man from Mark, Chapter 10. Concerning the young man's search for guidance, Richardson said, \\"He didn't go to India and ask a guru; he didn't get caught up in the younger generation, but he went to God's son, Jesus Christ, the Messiah, with his question.‚Äù He has spoken at five Billy Graham Crusades, as well as at various churches. Richardson is a speaker with Christian Speakers 360, available to appear at events. Several of his Yankee teammates requested that he preside at their funerals, most notably Mickey Mantle. Speaking to an audience of 2,000 (plus television viewers) at Mantle's interment, Richardson said there were two types of people in this world, those who said yes to Christ and those who said no. Shortly before Mantle's death, as Richardson had visited Mantle in a Dallas hospital, Mantle had told Richardson that he had become a Christian. In 1965, Richardson released his autobiography, The Bobby Richardson Story. The story became a movie in 1968. Excerpts from the film's audio track were available on an LP record titled: The Bobby Richardson Story: The Exciting First-Person Account of His Own Life, By the Yankees' Famous Second Baseman. He released a new autobiography in 2012 called Impact Player.

It is under the administration of the prefecture-level city of Suzhou. Name There is a strong possibility that the name Kunshan is derived from a hill, but which one is controversial. According to an impacted version, the hill is present-day Little Kunshan (Xiaokunshan) in Shanghai's Songjiang District. The character (Kun) was the old Chinese name for the Kunlun Mountains. From it developed the Chinese idiom \\"a jade from Kunlun Mountains\\", meaning any \\"outstanding figure\\". This was applied to Lu Ji and a hill in his hometown was designated as Kun to commemorate him.  History  Maps of \\"Koen-chan-hien\\" and other towns of \\"Kiang-nan\\" from Du Halde's 1736 Description of China, based on accounts by Jesuit missionaries Lou county () which administered Kunshan and the area around was established in Qin dynasty. It was named after Lou River (; present-day Liu River: ), while its seat was located in the north eastern of Kunshan. In 507, Xinyi county () which hold Lou county 's former seat was separated from the old Lou county. In 535, the old Kunshan county was separated from the old Xinyi county, while its seat was moved to the north of Kun Hill, Songjiang. In 751, the seat was moved to the south of Ma'anshan (Ma'an Hill: ; in Kunshan nowadays). In 1724, then Kunshan county was divided into new Kunshan county and Xinyang county (), the walled city also was halved to locate their own seat respectively. In 1860, Taiping Rebellions captured the walled city, then the Ever Victorious Army?recaptured it in 1863. On 11 November 1911, the local rally announced that both of the counties seceded from the Qing court from then on. In 1912, Xinyang county was merged into Kunshan county. On 15 November 1937, the Japanese army captured the walled city. On 13 May 1949, the CPC controlled the walled city. On 28 September 1989, the county was turn into a county-level city.  Administration  Kunshan is divided into 10 towns: * Yushan (, the seat of city nominally) * Bacheng () * Dianshanhu () * Huaqiao () * Jinxi () * Lujia () * Qiandeng () * Zhangpu () * Zhoushi () * Zhouzhuang (Âë®Â∫Ñ) However, both of Yushan and Huaqiao are nominal divisions at present, they even not to be listed in an official website. Kunshan New & Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone (, KSND) administering the main part of Yushan functions as the seat of the city, while Huaqiao Economic Development Zone () administers the north of Huaqiao and Kunshan Economic & Technological Development Zone (, KETD) administers the east of Yushan. On July 10, 2018, the Jiangsu Provincial Government approved the Master Plan of Kunshan for Urban Development (2017-2035), which is based on the master plan of the Xiong‚Äôan New Area. These zones include the Qingyang Port Waterfront City Center, the Duke Creative Park, the Kunshan South Gateway, the Chaoyang Road CBD and the Tinglin Park Traditional Culture Zone‚Äîin addition to the S1 Rail Line Corridor. Qingyang Port Waterfront City Center Covering an area of 3.4 sq km, the area is located in Kunshan‚Äôs city center. Planned as an ecological, cultural and smart area, it will include six zones‚Äîa media port, a cultural oasis, an urban lifestyle community, a waterfront park, a futuristic life experience center, and a youth entrepreneurship park. The area is designed to be a waterfront space that will enrich and diversify citizens‚Äô urban life as the most environmentally attractive and economically prosperous hub in the city. Duke Creative Park The park is located west of the city‚Äôs technology innovation cluster, covering an area of 3.84 sq km. It sits nearby three lakes, two industrial parks, and a town. With the support of Duke Kunshan University, the area will host the Sino-US (Kunshan) Technology Innovation Center and serve as a mixed-used project integrating R&D; centers, business services, and ecological parks. It aims to become a global magnet for technology entrepreneurs and innovators. Kunshan South Gateway The area is located around the city‚Äôs high-speed railway station, with an area of 1.6 sq km. While serving as a transportation hub integrating high-speed trains, rail transportation, and public buses, the area will develop businesses such as office spaces for lease, business services and recruitment agencies. As an open, innovative modern gateway, the area will become an important business cluster in the inter-city economic belt of Shanghai and Nanjing. Chaoyang Road CBD The CBD covers an area of 5.55 sq km in the old city center of Kunshan. The area will be furnished with enhanced amenities and infrastructure according to a plan featuring ‚Äúone ring, two axes, three centers and four zones‚Äù. The project aims to revive and transform the old city center into an exquisite and livable model business district. Tinglin Park Traditional Culture Zone The zone is located at the foot of Yufeng Mountain, with a planned area of 0.73 sq km. It is designed with cultural and art parks, culture-oriented businesses and ecological and leisure facilities. It will epitomize the natural beauty and cultural richness of the city. S1 Rail Line Corridor The line is 41 km long and will be completely constructed underground with 28 stops. The line will pass by all the major zones of the city and will significantly alleviate local traffic congestion. The project will be integrated with the surface transportation system and serve as a strong boost to the city‚Äôs renewal.  Geography  = Topography = The area is relatively flat, but there is a gentle slope stretching from the south-east to north-west. The northern part consists of dense polder, while the southern part is dotted with various lakes. The major lakes are Dianshan Lake, Yangcheng Lake, Cheng Lake and Kuilei Lake. Wusong River winds through the city, while smaller rivers criss-cross it in a grid pattern. = Climate = According to the analysis of the local meteorological bureau, from 1961 to 2008, the annual and seasonal air temperatures were the increasing trends, especially in spring. The total precipitation remained static relatively, however, much concentrated in summer and winter. Economy Apartment blocks in Kunshan The composition of local GDP have changed drastically since 1978. In 1978, the primary sector, the secondary sector and the tertiary sector accounted for 51.4%, 28.9% and 19.7% respectively. However, the data in 2015 were 0.9%, 55.1% and 44.0%. Kunshan is also home to over 1,000 hi-tech companies that have helped shape the city‚Äôs four economic pillars‚Äîoptoelectronics, semiconductors, intelligent manufacturing, and RNAi and biomedicine. The total GDP of Kunshan was 316 billion RMB, listed as No.1 of all Chinese county-level city in 2016. Kunshan is also home to many Taiwanese who have invested over the decades since China's opening up to the world in the late 70s.Chien, Shiuh-Shen & Zhao, Litao. (2008).

T√µnisson also fought for the development of the Estonian economy, paying special attention to the joint activities, such as the establishing of the first agricultural co-operatives in Estonia, also the Estonian Loan and Savings Society was founded after his initiative.XX sajandi kroonika, I osa; Eesti Ents√ºklopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 32 In 1901, Konstantin P√§ts founded the second Estonian daily newspaper, starting a political rivalry not only between Postimees and the new Teataja, but also between Jaan T√µnisson and Konstantin P√§ts themselves. T√µnisson was to lead the \\"moralist\\" and P√§ts the \\"economic\\" fraction of the national movement. Both tried to become leading national figures, T√µnisson was ideological and nationalist, P√§ts emphasized the importance of economic activity.XX sajandi kroonika, I osa; Eesti Ents√ºklopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 27 =Early political career= While T√µnisson did not approve of Estonians participating in the Revolution of 1905, it did not prevent him from passionately protesting against the punishment actions in Estonia, organized by the imperial powers. Lacking support for Estonians participating in the revolution, T√µnisson got into conflicts with more radical Estonian politicians. This however saved him from having to go to exile, as did Konstantin P√§ts and Otto Strandman. Following the revolution, Emperor Nicholas II was forced to give citizens certain political freedoms. T√µnisson used the October Manifesto to widen the rights of Estonians, establishing the first Estonian political party ‚Äì Estonian National Progress Party (Eesti Rahvuslik Eduerakond ‚Äì ERE; or Eesti Rahvameelne Eduerakond ‚Äì Estonian Progressive People's Party) together with Villem Reiman. The party supported improving the nationalist and liberal ideas and constitutional rights. The platform was similar to the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) of Russia, with minor differences in agricultural and nationality issues. It was seen as having moderate policies for not supporting the revolution, but still wanted ethnic Estonians to have equal rights with Russians and Baltic Germans and wanted Russia to be a constitutional monarchy.XX sajandi kroonika, I osa; Eesti Ents√ºklopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 55 Unlike more radical political groups, the National Progress Party remained legal also after the Revolution had been forced down.Histrodamus ‚Äì Eesti olulisemad erakonnad In December 1905, T√µnisson organised the gathering of Estonian representatives in Tartu. Soon after its first meeting, many representatives supported Jaan Teemant, who was a keen supporter of the revolution, to be the chairman of the meeting instead of the more moderate T√µnisson. Teemant won the election overwhelmingly, but T√µnisson refused to leave. Eventually, T√µnisson and his moderate supporters left the gathering, while the remaining representatives turned the meeting into a discussion about how to take revolutionary power, much to the dismay of even Jaan Teemant. In 1906, the National Progress Party saw great support and T√µnisson was among the four Estonian politicians to be elected to the First State Duma in 1906, where he joined the Autonomist- Federalist group. T√µnisson was elected to the board of this group and he organized a separate Baltic fraction for the group.XX sajandi kroonika, I osa; Eesti Ents√ºklopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 60 He also joined the protest movement against the actions of the Russian government, trying to protect the new rights that the Emperor was trying to take back. On 23 June 1906, T√µnisson and 177 other members of the State Duma signed Vyborg Appeal, calling for disobedience, in protest against the dissolution of the State Duma. T√µnisson was removed from the Postimees board (he resumed shortly afterwards) and in December 1907, he was put on trial. T√µnisson was sentenced to three months in Tartu prison.XX sajandi kroonika, I osa; Eesti Ents√ºklopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 69 Prison did not inhibit T√µnisson's political activity. In the years following the revolution he concentrated on developing the Estonian school system, founding school societies all over the country and opening several Estonian-language high schools. The co-operation and agriculture policies, that T√µnisson had established, developed quickly, creating an Estonian civil society and influencing the general growth of wealth in Estonia. In 1915, Jaan T√µnisson and Jaan Raamot initiated the creation of Northern Baltic Committee for the protection of war refugees. T√µnisson serves as chairman of the committee until 1917, hoping to get closer to administrative power. =Autonomy= Following the February Revolution, Estonians quickly reacted and gained the rights to autonomy and to form a national army from the Russian Provisional Government. In March 1917, T√µnisson met with Prime Minister of Russia Georgy Lvov, who however couldn't promise autonomy and said that the Russian Provincial Assembly.XX sajandi kroonika, I osa; Eesti Ents√ºklopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 149 In the debates about the autonomy, T√µnisson supported the current division of Estonia with two governorates, only with autonomy for each. Konstantin P√§ts's idea of a single Autonomous Governorate of Estonia went through and T√µnisson, among some other Estonian politicians, was chosen to compose the draft of self-government reform.XX sajandi kroonika, I osa; Eesti Ents√ºklopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 150 T√µnisson was often among the few politicians, who contacted directly with the Russian Provisional Government in these questions.XX sajandi kroonika, I osa; Eesti Ents√ºklopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 151 Eventually, the Autonomous Governorate of Estonia was created and T√µnisson was elected to the Estonian Provincial Assembly (Maap√§ev) in 1917. His party, renamed to Estonian Democratic Party (Eesti Demokraatlik Erakond ‚Äì EDE), achieved 7 of the 55 seats. At first, T√µnisson proposed the idea of a Scandinavian superstate, that eventually involved into supporting total secession from Russia. However, in late autumn 1917, T√µnisson was among the first Estonian politicians, who started demanding full independence for Estonia. After the October Revolution, local communists disbanded the Provincial Assembly. On 28 November 1917, most of its members met in Toompea Castle and declared the assembly to be the highest legitimate power in Estonia. In a speech in the parliament, T√µnisson emphasized the situation of anarchy in Russia and supported the declaration, that eventually turned into a successful coup d'etat.XX sajandi kroonika, I osa; Eesti Ents√ºklopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 162 Subsequently, T√µnisson was arrested by Bolshevik forces on 4 December 1917 for organizing a pro- Provincial Assembly meeting in Tartu. He was forced out of the country on 8 December. The Council of Elders of the assembly came together underground and decided to make him an Estonian delegate to Stockholm to find support for Estonian independence, or at least for its autonomy. T√µnisson and other members of the Russian Provincial Assembly were named Estonian delegates abroad and T√µnisson became the leader of Estonian Foreign Delegations, a position that would still be his when Estonia declared its independence on 24 February 1918. The delegations were eventually turned into embassies and in Stockholm, T√µnisson met with German and French ambassadors to find support for Estonian independence, but was later sent to Copenhagen, though several Estonian delegates eventually gathered in Stockholm.XX sajandi kroonika, I osa; Eesti Ents√ºklopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 166 On 16 March 1918, Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs agreed to meet the delegates, but didn't grant any support.XX sajandi kroonika, I osa; Eesti Ents√ºklopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 172 After the German Occupation of Estonia had ended, T√µnisson returned to Estonia on 16 November 1918.XX sajandi kroonika, I osa; Eesti Ents√ºklopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 180 =Independence= From 12 November 1918, T√µnisson served as Minister without portfolioVabariigi Valitsus ‚Äì Ajutine Valitsus 12.11.1918 ‚Äì 27 November 1918 and from 27 November 1918 to 9 May 1919 as Minister plenipotentiary abroad of the Estonian Provisional Government, led by Konstantin P√§ts.Vabariigi Valitsus ‚Äì Ajutine valitsus 27 November 1918 ‚Äì 09.05.1919 T√µnisson's offices sent him abroad again, this time to Finland to seek weaponry and loans in the coming War of Independence. He was also part of the Estonian delegation at the Paris Peace Conference. For the elections to the Estonian Constituent Assembly, T√µnisson had yet again transformed his party, this time to the Estonian People's Party. In the elections of the Constituent Assembly in spring 1919, the centre-right (conservative-liberal) People's Party took 25 of the 120 seats, fewer than the Estonian Social Democratic Workers' Party (ESDTP) and the Labour Party. The shape of the new republic was to be determined by parties of the left and parties of the centre, including T√µnisson's People's Party. On 18 November 1919, T√µnisson became the Prime Minister of Estonia. Already on the next day, the government decided, that Estonia would start peace negotiations with Russia and on 2 February 1920, the Tartu Peace Treaty was signed, ending the War of Independence. With the treaty, Estonia and Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic became the first countries to recognize each other's independence. Several countries at Russia's border and also in the West reacted negatively on Estonia's decision to sign peace with Soviet Russia.XX sajandi kroonika, I osa; Eesti Ents√ºklopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 210 In December 1920, relations with Latvia deteriorated, when Estonia forced Latvian administration out of the border town of Valga (Valka). Through British mediation, the conflict was resolved and Valga was divided between the two countries.XX sajandi kroonika, I osa; Eesti Ents√ºklopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 208 The coalition consisted of the three major parties in the parliament: T√µnisson's People's Party with the social democratic ESDTP and the centre-left Labour Party. On 1 July 1920, ESDTP left the coalition because of ideological differences and the entire cabinet fell on 28 July 1920, after T√µnisson failed to find a new coalition partner.Vabariigi Valitsus ‚Äì Vabariigi Valitsus 18 November 1919 ‚Äì 28 July 1920 A new head of government was hard to find. Members of the Labour Party failed in the attempt to find support and another member of the People's Party, Ado Birk was chosen to head the new cabinet. He however, also didn't get the support of the Constituent Assembly and his cabinet was in office only nominally for three days. From 30 July 1920 to 26 October 1920, Jaan T√µnisson headed his second cabinet as Prime Minister in the one-party coalition.Vabariigi Valitsus ‚Äì Vabariigi Valitsus 30 July 1920 ‚Äì 26 October 1920 The Estonian People's Party quickly lost its popularity and became one of the smallest parties in the parliament, getting only 10 in the 1920 elections, 8 in the 1923 elections and the 1926 elections and 9 of the 101 seats in the 1929 elections. T√µnisson himself however remained popular and despite the few seats in the Riigikogu, the Estonian People's Party was a coalition member in nine of the twelve cabinets between 1920 and 1932. A prominent member of the People's Party, J√ºri Jaakson, was even State Elder of the grand coalition cabinet after the Communist coup attempt from 1924 to 1925.Vabariigi Valitsus Vabariigi Valitsus 16 December 1924 ‚Äì 15 December 1925 From 7 June 1923 to 27 May 1925, T√µnisson served as the President (speaker) of the Riigikogu. Jaan T√µnisson formed his third cabinet on 9 December 1927, for the first time as State Elder. It was another wide coalition with the Labour Party, Settlers' party and Farmers' Assemblies. The government fell on 4 December 1928.Vabariigi Valitsus ‚Äì Vabariigi Valitsus 09.12.1927 ‚Äì 04.12.1928 T√µnisson returned to big politics on 12 February 1931, when he became the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Konstantin P√§ts's cabinet.Vabariigi Valitsus Vabariigi Valitsus 12.02.1931 ‚Äì 19 February 1932 During the early 1930s, political climate in Estonia changed. In October 1931, the Christian People's Party merged into the Estonian People's Party which joined with the Labour Party to form the National Centre Party in early 1932. Three major parties had emerged in the Riigikogu, the left-wing Estonian Socialist Workers' Party, the center-right National Centre Party and the right-wing Union of Settlers and Smallholders. P√§ts's cabinet resigned, but T√µnisson remained in the same office also in Jaan Teemant's cabinet until it also resigned on 19 July 1932.Vabariigi Valitsus ‚Äì Vabariigi Valitsus 19 February 1932 ‚Äì 19 July 1932 The 1932 elections brought the National Centre Party 23 of the 101 seats in the Riigikogu, making it the second biggest party in the parliament. T√µnisson then served again as the President (speaker) of the Riigikogu from 19 July 1932 to 18 May 1933. Due to economical differences, the National Centre Party had left the governing coalition and Jaan T√µnisson formed his fourth cabinet on 18 May 1933. The refounded Settlers' Party, that had again seceded from the Union of Settlers and Smallholders, was the only coalition partner for the People's Party.Vabariigi Valitsus ‚Äì Vabariigi Valitsus 18 May 1933 ‚Äì 21 October 1933 Decisions of T√µnisson's government during the financial crisis in 1932 led to a total decline in his personal popularity, though the policies would help the state out of the crisis. In a referendum in 1933, the voters adopted an authoritarian constitution, which would lead to Konstantin P√§ts coming to power in 1934. P√§ts soon suspended the activities of both the political parties and the parliament also imposed limits to civil liberty, disbanding the parliament in 1934 and all political parties in 1935. With the changing situation in Estonia, T√µnisson became the leader of the democratic opposition. As a result, the government expropriated his newspaper Postimees, though that did not keep T√µnisson from promoting democratic ideals. Jaan T√µnisson (left) with Estonian General Gustav Jonson in 1938 The semi-democratic elections of 1938, T√µnisson was re-elected to the State Assembly (Riigivolikogu), the lower chamber of the Riigikogu, where he continued fighting for the total restoration of democracy in Estonia. By 1939 though, Estonia was considered to be in the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union, after the signing of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. And in 1940 Estonia was completely occupied by the Soviet Union. T√µnisson tried to influence President Konstantin P√§ts on resisting the Soviet occupation, at least symbolically, but P√§ts had already decided to surrender unresistingly. In the summer of 1940 T√µnisson started an extensive campaign, organising the nomination of rival candidates to the communist ones in the elections of the Soviet puppet parliament of Estonia. The Soviets, wanting complete control of the parliament, removed their rivals by forceful means.

During his trial, T√µnisson neither regretted anything nor gave up any information about other politicians who opposed the Soviets. The exact whereabouts of T√µnisson after the trial and the circumstances of his death remain a mystery. The most credible speculation about his death centres on T√µnisson being shot dead in Tallinn during the first days of July in 1941. His place of burial is unknown. T√µnisson's moral views and honorable death inspired Estonians for decades to symbolically resist the Soviet regime and to eventually regain independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. A memorial to T√µnisson was erected in Tartu in 1999.

A battle honour is an award of a right by a government or sovereign to a military unit to emblazon the name of a battle or operation on its flags (\\"colours\\"), uniforms or other accessories where ornamentation is possible. In European military tradition, military units may be acknowledged for their achievements in specific wars or operations of a military campaign. In Great Britain and those countries of the Commonwealth which share a common military legacy with the British, battle honours are awarded to selected military units as official acknowledgement for their achievements in specific wars or operations of a military campaign. These honours usually take the form of a place and a date (e.g. \\"Cambrai 1917\\"). Theatre honours, a type of recognition in the British tradition closely allied to battle honours, were introduced to honour units which provided sterling service in a campaign but were not part of specific battles for which separate battle honours were awarded. Theatre honours could be listed and displayed on regimental property but not emblazoned on the colours. Since battle honours are primarily emblazoned on colours, artillery units, which do not have colours in the British military tradition, were awarded honour titles instead. These honour titles were permitted to be used as part of their official nomenclature, for example 13 Field Regiment (Chushul). Similar honours in the same tenor include unit citations. Battle honours, theatre honours, honour titles and their ilk form a part of the wider variety of distinctions which serve to distinguish military units from each other. In the British military tradition =Origins= For the British Army, the need to adopt a system to recognise military units' battlefield accomplishments was apparent since its formation as a standing army in the later part of the 17th century. Although the granting of battle honours had already been in place at the time, it was not until 1784 that infantry units were authorised to bear battle honours on their colours. Before then, a regiment's colours were practical tools for rallying troops in the battlefield and not quite something for displaying the unit's past distinctions. The first battle honour to be awarded in the British Army was granted to the 15th Hussars for the Battle of Emsdorf in 1760. Thereafter, other regiments received battle honours for some of their previous engagements. The earliest battle honour in the British Army is Tangier 1662‚Äì80, granted to the Tangier Horse (later known as the 1st Royal Dragoons), the oldest line cavalry regiment of the British army, who in 1969 amalgamated with the Royal Horse Guards to become The Blues and Royals. Also awarded the honour was the 2nd Regiment of Foot, or the Tangier Regiment now The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, the senior English regiment in the Union (after the Royal Scots, the senior Scottish and British Regiment), for their protracted 23-year defence of the Colony of Tangier. The battle honour is still held by the successor regiment, the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment. During these early years of the British standing army, a regiment needed only to engage the enemy with musketry before it was eligible for a battle honour. However, older battle honours are carried on the standards of the Yeomen of the Guard and the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms, neither of which are part of the army, but are instead the Sovereign's Bodyguard, in the personal service of the sovereign. The need to develop a centralised system to oversee the selection and granting of battle honours arose in the 19th century following the increase of British military engagements during the expansion of the Empire. Thus in 1882, a committee was formed to adjudicate applications of battle honour claims. This committee, later called the Battles Nomenclature Committee, still maintains its function in the British Army today. =Entitlement= A battle honour may be granted to infantry/cavalry regiments or battalions, as well as ships (see Naval battle honours below) and squadrons; they are rarely granted to sub-units such as companies, platoons and sections in the army. Battle honours are usually presented in the form of a name of a country, region, or city where the unit's distinguished act took place, usually together with the year when it occurred. Not every battle fought will automatically result in the granting of a battle honour. Conversely, a regiment or a battalion might obtain more than one battle honour over the course of a larger operation. For example, the 2nd Battalion of the Scots Guards were awarded two battle honours for their role in the Falklands War; \\"Tumbledown Mountain\\" specifically for the Battle of Mount Tumbledown, and \\"Falkland Islands 1982\\" for the overall conflict. Similarly, while in Korea, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry earned both \\"Kapyong\\" (for the Battle of Kapyong) and \\"Korea 1951‚Äì1953\\" (for the overall war). A unit does not have to successfully defeat their adversary to earn a battle honour: the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps received the battle honour \\"Hong Kong\\" despite the defeat and capture of most of the force during the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong, while the cruiser was awarded the naval engagement honour \\"Kormoran 1941\\" after being sunk with all aboard by the German raider Kormoran. Supporting corps/branches such as medical, service, ordnance, or transport do not currently receive battle honours. However and uniquely the Royal Logistic Corps has five battle honours inherited from its previous transport elements, such as the Royal Waggon Train. Commonwealth artillery does not maintain battle honours as they carry neither colours nor guidons‚Äîthough their guns by tradition are afforded many of the same respects and courtesies. However, both the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers were in 1832 granted by King William IV the right to use the Latin \\"Ubique\\", meaning everywhere, as a battle honour. This is worn on the cap badge of both the Corps of Royal Engineers and the Royal Regiment of Artillery (but not the Royal Horse Artillery). Likewise the Royal Marines, although a colours- carrying service, was granted, along with the conventional battle honour of \\"Gibraltar\\", the \\"Great Globe itself\\" by King George IV for its very numerous battle honours around the world. The practice was later extended to these same regiments and corps in the successor Commonwealth armed forces. =Battle honours for the Second World War= The Battles Nomenclature Committee's responsibility was to advise the operational Army Headquarters staff on matters pertaining to the granting of battle honours. At the end of the war, the committee submitted a report to the Army Headquarters containing: * The definitions of war theatre, battle, action and engagement * A detailed list of all theatres, battles, actions and engagements throughout the entire war for which regiments could be granted battle honours A copy of this document was then forwarded to regimental honours committees. By army orders, a regimental honours committee would comprise at least five officers of the regiment. These officers should include the regiment's past and present commanding officers as well as honorary colonel and lieutenant colonel. Upon a review of this list, and based on the actions undertaken by the regiment during the war, the regimental honours committee could then submit an application to the Army Headquarters to claim their corresponding battle honours. In cases where regiments took part in actions which were not listed, the honours committees could also submit additional claims in their applications. Whatever the situation, it was the regimental honour committee's responsibility to submit evidence to prove that the regiment concerned was worthy of the battle honours they claimed. Once the final approval was granted in Britain, a public announcement would be made. The ceremonial granting of new battle honours would be made in the form of the presentation of new Regimental and Sovereign's Colours to the regiment by the British monarch or an agent of the Crown, such as the Governor General of a commonwealth dominion. =Display= In British and Commonwealth armies a unit's battle honours can normally be found engraved, painted or embroidered on: * The Queen's Colour/King's Colour and Regimental Colour (in regiments of Foot Guards and line infantry) * The Regimental guidon (for cavalry regiments) * The Queen's Truncheon of the Royal Gurkha Rifles * Drums of the regimental band and the corps of drums/pipes and drums * The baldric worn by the Drum Major of the regimental band/pipes and drums * The Drum Major's mace * A regimental pipes and drums' pipe banners As there is no order of precedence for battle honours, they are listed in chronological order, either in a single list, or in multiple even numbers of columns, reading left to right, and top to bottom. On drums, the honours are listed on scrolls, usually with the cap badge central, and other unit devices present (such as a representation of a unit distinction or motto). The honours for the First and Second World Wars were restricted in that only a certain number of honours (up to ten each for the First and Second World Wars) could be selected for emblazonment, that is appear on colours or drums. This was due to the large number of battle honours awarded. It is often the case that battle honours not carried on the colours (limited by space and design) will be emblazoned on the drum major's baldric. =Significance= While regimental colours and guidons are no longer carried on operations by British and Commonwealth military, as was their initial military function, the battle honours they carry are held in high esteem by military personnel. Regiments take pride in their battle honours, and the winning of further battle honours, as these are seen to enhance a unit's reputation. It remains a tradition that whenever military personnel meet a colour or guidon, it must be saluted. This is not only because it is an object which represents the authority of the Crown, but also because the colours contain a regiment's battle honours, and thus represent the regiment's history and its deed. Saluting a colour or guidon is thus a pivotal act in retaining an awareness of regimental history and traditions‚Äîkey in the functioning of the regimental system. It remains common for army instructors to ensure that their recruits have memorised and are able to recite all of their regiment's battle honours. Such methods are meant to bring the new soldier into the regimental ethos and sub-culture by means of imprinting shared history. In some cases where a battle honour was not granted, a special distinction has been substituted. For example, soldiers of The Rifles wear a cap badge on both the front and the rear of their hats. This so-called \\"back badge\\" is unique in the British Army and was awarded to the 28th Regiment of Foot for their actions at the Battle of Alexandria in 1801. Knowledge of that battle honour, represented by the back badge, is said to have encouraged the soldiers of the Gloucestershire Regiment in the defence of Gloster Hill during the Battle of the Imjin River in April 1951 during the Korean War. Other uniform distinctions include: * Oakleaf Shoulder Badge (The Calgary Highlanders, The Canadian Scottish Regiment (Princess Mary's) and The Royal Winnipeg Rifles), awarded for \\"Kitcheners' Wood\\" in April 1915. No battle honour had been granted and the units petitioned for a special badge. * Sphinx: Several British regiments have a sphinx on their regimental colour as well as cap badges and belt buckles to commemorate service in Egypt, specifically the Battle of Alexandria in 1801. * Eagle: The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards have an eagle on their cap badge to commemorate the capture of a French Imperial Eagle at Waterloo by the Royal Scots Greys. The Blues and Royals similarly wear an eagle as a shoulder badge commemorating the Eagle captured at Waterloo by the Royal Dragoons. =Overseas awards to British military units= Subject to approval by the sovereign, awards made by other allied nations may be permitted to be worn or carried. For example, several units have been awarded the French Croix de guerre 1914‚Äì1918 and Croix de guerre 1939‚Äì1945, the ribbon of which can be worn on the uniform. The United States Presidential Unit Citation, as with other similar citations, is similarly worn on the uniform (usually on the arm), but is also carried on the colour or guidon of the unit it has been awarded to. In the Commonwealth, three units are permitted to carry this award on their Regimental Colour: * 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry * 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment * D Company, 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (Awarded to D Company but carried by the battalion as a whole) The 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry and the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment received their awards for their actions at the Battle of Kapyong during the Korean War. Although their regiments carry the honour \\"Kapyong\\" as a whole, only these specific battalions are permitted to carry the PUC streamer that denotes the award by the United States and wear the ribbon on the uniform. D Company, 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment were awarded their Presidential Unit Citation for their actions during the Battle of Long Tan in the Vietnam War. Although awarded to D Company, it is carried on the 6th Battalion's Colours and worn on the uniform of all members of the battalion. The PUC was awarded to the 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment for its actions at the Battle of Imjin River in 1951, with the tradition continued by its successor, the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment, until its amalgamation into The Rifles. =Naval battle honours= A carved board displaying the battle honours carried by the cruiser . The battle honours (and the campaigns they were earned for) are: ‚Ä¢ MEDITERRANEAN 1941 (Battle of the Mediterranean) ‚Ä¢ SAVO ISLAND 1942 (Battle of Savo Island) ‚Ä¢ PACIFIC 1945 (Pacific War) ‚Ä¢ GUADALCANAL 1942-3 (Guadalcanal Campaign) ‚Ä¢ CORAL SEA 1942 (Battle of the Coral Sea) Naval battle honours are battle honours awarded to warships. There are two types of naval battle honours: those awarded to ships that participate in a battle or campaign, or those for single-ship actions.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 233 Honours for battles take their name from the location of the battle, while honours for actions are named for the opposing ship. These are rendered differently, in order to distinguish between the two types and to limit confusion between battle honours with the same name (for example, between the multi-ship Battle of the Chesapeake in 1781, and the capture of USS Chesapeake by HMS Shannon in 1813). In older sources and on battle honour boards, battles are written in all capitals, while actions are capitalised normally and surrounded by single quotation marks (CHESAPEAKE 1781 and 'Chesapeake' 1813). Newer sources display battles with normal capitalisation, and italicise actions in the same way ships' names are italicised; both may or may not be contained in double quotation marks (\\"Chesapeake 1781\\" and \\"Chesapeake 1813\\"). The battle honours awarded to a ship are inherited by all subsequent warships of the same name.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 1 Battle honours for Commonwealth warships were initially awarded and controlled by the British Admiralty, under the \\"Commonwealth Battle Honours List\\". Warships of Commonwealth navies would also inherit the honours of any preceding British warship of the name. Commonwealth navies later moved to independent but parallel systems. Australia began moving away by instituting a battle honour for the ships that served in the Vietnam War, then moved to a completely independent system before 1993, to avoid inheriting the battle honours of the British Newcastles. The Royal Canadian Navy began displaying battle honours in the 1950s, but after the Unification of the Canadian Forces in 1968, new units entering service would only carry those honours earned by Canadian ships. The earliest recorded naval battle honour is ARMADA 1588, the defeat of the Spanish Armada at Gravelines by a combined British-Dutch fleet. Because of the significant number of ships sunk during World War I and World War II, only three battle honours have been awarded for single-ship actions since the start of the 20th century: to the cruiser for sinking the German light cruiser during the Battle of Cocos in November 1914 ('Emden' 1914), to the Commonwealth warships involved in the pursuit and last battle of the in May 1941 ('Bismarck' 1941), and to the cruiser for the mutually destructive engagement with the in November 1941 ('Kormoran' 1941). Battle honour board As warships do not carry regimental colours, battle honours are instead displayed on a battle honour board. This is usually a solid wooden board (traditionally teak) mounted on the ship's superstructure, carved with the ship's badge and scrolls naming the ship and the associated honours, and either left completely unpainted, or with the lettering painted gold. The size of the board and number of scrolls is dependent on the number of honours earned by a ship and her predecessors, although it is common for blank scrolls to be included in a design.Cassells, The Destroyers, pp. 233‚Äì4 Other designs are also in use: these include plaques for the ship and honours mounted on a backing board, or the details painted onto a flat board. The British Admiralty set honour board sizes for various types of ship: for capital ships and shore bases, for cruisers and large auxiliary ships, for all other surface ships, and for submarines (the size restriction is so the board can be moved through the submarine's hatches, as it is only displayed when the submarine is on the surface). =Unusual awards of battle honours= Two educational institutions have been awarded battle honours. La Martinere College in Lucknow, India was awarded a battle honour, Defence of Lucknow 1857, for the role played by its students and teachers during the mutiny of 1857. McGill University in Canada received the award for their contingent's bravery at Arras in 1917 during the First World War. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, although a civilian police force, was awarded the status of a dragoon regiment by King George V following the service of many of its members during the First World War. As a consequence, it then became entitled to display the many honours it had won dating back to 1885: * Northwest Canada 1885, South Africa 1900‚Äì02 * The Great War: France and Flanders 1918, Siberia 1918‚Äì19 * The Second World War: Europe, 1939‚Äì45 In addition, the RCMP received the honorary distinction of the badge of the Canadian Provost Corps, in recognition of the fact that the first Canadian military police unit was formed from volunteers from the RCMP. The Army Post Office Corps (APOC) was the first British Volunteer unit to be awarded a battle honour for their participation in the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War. The honour (Egypt 1882) was displayed on the regimental flag of 24 Middlesex Rifle Volunteer Corps (Post Office Rifles). The only cadet unit to receive a battle honour is 1st Cadet Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC). Around 100 older cadets, principally non-commissioned officers, served in the South African War with the KRRC, the City Imperial Volunteers and the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC). Four cadets were killed in action. In recognition of this service, King Edward VII granted the battalion the Battle Honour \\"South Africa 1900-1902\\".Army Order AO 151 of 1905 They are permitted to wear a miniature KRRC cap badge with this single battle honour, and call their members ‚Äúriflemen‚Äù rather than cadets. France Flag of the 1 RIMA. The regiment has been awarded fifteen battle honours. In France, Battle honours, known officially as inscriptions des noms de batailles au drapeau, were created during the Wars of the French Revolution. The first honour such awarded is Valmy, 1792 , the last one to date is Kowe√Øt, 1991 . The honours are sewn in gold letters on the regiment's flag or standard under the form , (such as Austerlitz, 1805 ). In some cases, the honour refers to a whole conflict and take the form , (such as AFN, 1952-1962 ) or simply , (such as Grande guerre, 1914-1918 ). Some military schools and academies have their motto sewn on their flags as a battle honour, such as √âcole polytechnique's Pour la Patrie, les sciences et la gloire (for Fatherland, Sciences and Glory) in addition to the \\"true\\" battle honour Paris, 1814 . D√âCISION N¬∞ 12350/SGA/DMPA/SHD/DAT relative aux inscriptions de noms de batailles sur les drapeaux et √©tendards des corps de troupe de l'arm√©e de terre, du service de sant√© des arm√©es et du service des essences des arm√©es During the 19th century, honours were limited to eight on a regiment's flag, leading to erase some honours in order to make room for newer ones. This limitation was upped to twelve honours after the Second World War. Some units, such as the 2 RIMA, have been awarded more than twelve honours, but their flag displays only the twelve considered the most important in the history of the regiment. Other units, such as the 1 RIMA, have been granted a dispensation allowing them to emblazon all their battle honours, regardless of their number. In addition to battle honours, military units can be awarded collective military decorations and collective mentions in dispatches, leading eventually to the fourrag√®re award. Battle and theatre honours in India Prior to independence, battle honours were awarded to British Indian Army as part of the British military tradition. Awards prior to the takeover of the Presidency Armies by the Crown in 1858 were done by the Governor General in India or the respective Presidency government that the units belonged to. The practice of awarding battle honours and theatre honours to the Indian Army continued after independence in 1947 and these honours continue to be listed against a regiment's achievements. Battle honours, but not theatre honours, are permitted to be emblazoned on the President's Colours, which have replaced the King's colours after independence. Battle honour days are celebrated by a few units or regiments. Present battle honour days however pertain to battles for which honours have been won post-independence. Some battle honours, granted prior to independence to units for battles or campaigns in India against the local rulers or nationalist forces, have been declared as 'repugnant' and are not celebrated or held in esteem.Singh, Sarbans (1993) Battle Honours of the Indian Army 1757 ‚Äì 1971. Vision Books (New Delhi) The earliest battle to be commemorated in the history of the British Indian Army was Plassey in 1757 which was awarded in 1829 vide Gazette of the Governor General No 43. La Martiniere Lucknow is the only school in the world to have been awarded royal battle honours for its role in the defence of Lucknow during the mutiny of 1857. In the honour of this institution, The President of India also launched a stamp post in its name.

It lies south of Bromley town centre and Bickley, west of Southborough and Petts Wood, north of Locksbottom and Keston, and east of Hayes. Amenities The A21 The area is centred on the road of the same name (part of the A21), stretching between Masons Hill at the south end of Bromley and Hastings Road, Locksbottom. Large-scale suburban development means that the area now merges into Southborough and Bickley. The main shopping and leisure area of the district is Chatterton Road, which has a number of popular restaurants, delicatessens, hair and beauty salons, and a range of hobby/craft and charity shops. The Chatterton Arms pub, which opened around 1870, was originally named the \\"Hit or Miss\\", presumably a reference to \\"Shooting Common\\", dating back to the 'dark' days of highwaymen. It was later renamed in honour of the 18th-century poet, Thomas Chatterton.Bromley Common News There are other pubs spread out over the area: The Bricklayers Arms on Masons Hill, A Toby Carvery at the junction of Bromley Common with Victoria Road, and the Lord Holmesdale on Homesdale Road. Havelock Recreations Ground, a slightly smaller park, lies a short distance to the north. The area has been awarded village status by the local authority and is known as Chatterton Village. Recent improvements include flower boxes, a village sign, Victorian- style lamp posts and a village notice board outside the bakery. The nearby Whitehall Recreation Ground has also been enhanced by the Friends of Whitehall Recreation Ground, with help from Bromley Council's Parks Department, with flower beds, seating, a picnic area, a wildlife pond and a refurbished children's play area (which was funded by the Friends of Whitehall Recreation Ground).  History  A hamlet was present here by the 1500s. Until the 1860s, Bromley Common consisted mainly of farmland and the estates of a few large landowners. The common itself was owned by the Bishops of Rochester as Lords of the Manor, but on the condition that various ‚Äòcommoners‚Äô should be allowed to freely enjoy their privileges on it. It amounted to about 300 acres, extending irregularly along the sides of the road that formed the main route from Tunbridge Wells and Hastings to Bromley and, beyond, to London. It was a well-known and profitable haunt for highwaymen. After the common was enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1826 (the Act was passed in 1821), there was some limited residential development, but this was mostly to the south of the old common, where it fanned out from the main road. A substantial number of homes had been built around Oakley Road and Princes Plain, such that in 1842 Holy Trinity Church, at the junction of Bromley Common and Oakley Road, was built to cater for the expanding population. In the northern section of the old common development was much more modest, with just a few dozen homes put up along the east side of the road. At the heart of what is now Chatterton Village stood the grounds of Bromley Villa (later renamed Walpole Lodge), a large house owned by gentryman landowner Henry Hebbert. It was his death in 1864, and the subsequent auction of Bromley Villa, that presaged the residential development out of which Chatterton Road was built. This first tranche of development to the east of Bromley Common stretched from Chantry Lane to Johnson Road, between which lay Pope Road and Walpole Road; connecting these roads and running parallel to Bromley Common was Chatterton Road. Only in the late 1870s did the area just to the north ‚Äì including Bloomfield, Addison and Cowper roads ‚Äì begin to be developed. The development to the south ‚Äì of Mosslea, Balfour, Albert, Victoria and Salisbury roads and Crown Lane ‚Äì began around the turn of the 20th century. Further development occurred in the 20th century, with Bromley Bus Garage opening here in 1924. The area to the west, formerly home to a house called The Rookery which later burnt down, was maintained as open space by green belt legislation. Part of the site was however set aside for the building of Bromley College in 1965. Cricket venue The first definite mention of the Bromley area in a cricket connection is a 1735 match on Bromley Common between a Kent side and London Cricket Club.H. T. Waghorn, Cricket Scores, Notes, etc. (1730-1773), Blackwood, 1899. The common was used for matches on at least 12 occasions between 1735 and 1752, a period which coincided with Bromley Cricket Club having one of the strongest teams in England during the career of Robert Colchin. The last historic match known to have been played there was between Bromley and London on 30 June 1752.G. B. Buckley, Fresh Light on 18th Century Cricket, Cotterell, 1935. Cricket has been played on the common in recent years.

However, it is perhaps best known to English speakers as a word for the 19th-century Polish cavalry headgear, consisting of a high, four-pointed cap with regimental insignia on the front (full name in Polish: czapka rogatywka, initially: konfederatka) to which feathers or rosettes were sometimes added. History Polish Uhlans wearing czapki =Origins= This headdress developed initially as a square-topped variant of a shako. In its early, compact form from 1784 onwards the czapka was introduced by Austrian uhlans, during the time Galicia was under Habsburg rule. Its use was spread from eastern Europe by the Polish Legion, fighting for the French in the Napoleonic Wars, and became popular not only among Napoleon's French and allied forces, such as Westphalia, Bavaria, Saxony and Naples, but also among the armies of his enemies. The Grand Duchy of Warsaw used them for infantry and artillery units, but otherwise they were only ever used for uhlan units. After the Polish lancers proved their effectiveness during the Napoleonic Wars, armies across Europe quickly adopted the concept of the lancer regiments, complete with the czapka as their headdresses. =Nineteenth-century usage= Danish soldier with Czapka At the end of the Napoleonic Wars the czapka continued to be worn by uhlans in Germany and Austria, as well as in France by Line-Regiment Lancers and later the Imperial Guard of Napoleon III. Lancer regiments in the British Army continued to wear czapki (described as \\"lance caps\\") for full dress until 1939para. 494 \\"Dress Regulations for the Army, 1934\\" and the modern Royal Lancers still retains this historic headdress for its Lancer Honour Guard. Along with the traditional double-breasted plastron-fronted lancer jacket, it is also still worn by the band of the Royal Yeomanry. Bandsman of the Royal Yeomanry (British Army Reserve) With the end of the Second French Empire the lancer regiments and thus the czapka disappeared from the French Army. Prussian Uhlans wearing czapki c1900 Czapka of a subaltern in the Austro- Hungarian 2nd Uhlan Regiment c1913 The German or Austro-Hungarian czapka (\\"shapka\\") consisted of a body of pressed blackened leather, known as the cap and only given a shield on the front. This ended halfway down the back of the head and only protected the front of the head. Instead of a peak, the front was centred on the front point of a four-cornered lid on a stem on top of the helmet. On the left front edge of this lid was attached the National or cockade. There was also a sleeve for the insertion of a brush plume. On the front of the body was a metal emblem (usually an eagle). In German parade examples, a Paraderabatte in the regimental colours was also worn on this type of helmet. In Austro-Hungary they were lined in the regimental colour. A leather chin strap on chains was attached, worn up on the front of the helmet when dismounted. In Austro-Hungary there was also the Kommode-Tschapka, a lighter and more convenient version for field service for officers, without the emblem on the front and with a Wachstuchschicht instead. The Portuguese cavalry included lancer (\\"lanceiros\\") regiments until the overthrow of the Monarchy in 1910, and these retained the czapka in full dress.Pedro Branco, \\"Exercito Portugues\\", Spanish lancers wore the \\"Polish style\\" headdress from 1833 until after 1868 when a nickel-plated helmet with spike was adopted.Francisco Santiago, \\"Los Lanceros\\", =World War I= In 1914 czapki were still worn in full dress by all Imperial German, Austro-Hungarian, British, Belgian and Russian lancer (uhlan) regiments. They varied in detail but all had the characteristic four sided top, resembling the mortar-board of academic dress. Plumes were common on parade and in several of the armies named the different regiments were distinguished by the colour of the top or sides. Belgian, Austro-Hungarian and German lancers wore their czapki on active service during the opening weeks of the war, usually with dull coloured or waterproof covers. In the case of the Austro-Hungarian Uhlans, since there were not enough of these coverings, many czapka helmets were summarily painted grey. German and Austro-Hungarian uhlans wore the czapka during the First World War, though it ceased to be worn for field uniform after the adoption of the \\"Stahlhelm\\" steel helmet in 1916. Czapka of a wachtmeister of 1st Uhlan Regiment of Polish Legions =Polish usage to present day= During the twentieth century the czapka became one of the symbols of Polish national independence. After World War I, the new Polish Army adopted a four-pointed form as its standard issue national headdress in the form of a rogatywka. After 1952 this czapka style hat was replaced by a round peaked cap of Soviet style, apart from soft field caps, which retained rogatywka style. However in 1982 the rogatywka re-appeared as the headdress of the ceremonial honour guard protecting Belvedere Palace. Officers of the modern Polish Army wear the four sided cap in certain orders of dress, although berets are the normal headdress.

By 1915, the French General Staff had concluded that even the best- protected forts of Verdun could not resist bombardments from the German 420 mm (16.5 in) Gamma guns. These new super-heavy howitzers had easily taken several large Belgian forts out of action in August 1914. Fort Douaumont and other Verdun forts were judged ineffective and had been partly disarmed and left virtually undefended since 1915. On 25 February 1916, Fort Douaumont was entered and occupied without a fight by a small German raiding party comprising only 19 officers and 79 men. The easy fall of Fort Douaumont, only three days after the beginning of the Battle of Verdun, shocked the French Army. It set the stage for the rest of a battle which lasted nine months, at enormous human cost. Douaumont was finally recaptured by three infantry divisions of the Second Army, during the First Offensive Battle of Verdun on 24 October 1916. This event brought closure to the battle in 1916. History Construction work started in 1885 near the village of Douaumont, on some of the highest ground in the area and the fort was continually reinforced until 1913. It has a total surface area of and is approximately long, with two subterranean levels protected by a steel reinforced concrete roof thick resting on a sand cushion. These improvements had been completed by 1903. The entrance to the fort was at the rear. Two main tunnels ran east‚Äìwest, one above the other, with barrack rooms and corridors to outlying parts of the fort branched off of the main tunnels. The fort was equipped with numerous armed posts, a 155 mm rotating/retractable gun turret, a 75 mm gun rotating/retractable gun turret, four other 75 mm guns in flanking \\"Bourges Casemates\\" that swept the intervals and several machine-gun turrets. Entry into the moat around the fort was interdicted by Hotchkiss anti-personnel revolving cannons located in wall casemates or \\"Coffres\\" present at each corner. With hindsight, Douaumont was much better prepared to withstand the heaviest bombardments than the Belgian forts that had been crushed by German Gamma howitzers in 1914. The German invasion of Belgium in 1914 had forced military planners to radically rethink the utility of fortification in war. The Belgian forts had been quickly destroyed by German artillery and easily overrun. In August 1915, General Joseph Joffre approved the reduction of the garrison at Douaumont and at other Verdun forts. Douaumont was stripped of all its weaponry except for the two turreted guns that were too difficult to remove: a 155 mm and a 75 mm gun. The two \\"Casemates de Bourges\\" bunkers, one on each side of the fort, were disarmed of their four 75s. The garrison was mostly middle-aged reservists, under the command of the city's military governor and not the field army. =Capture= On 21 February 1916, the German 5th Army began an offensive which started the Battle of Verdun. Douaumont was the largest and highest fort on the two concentric rings of forts protecting the city and thus the keystone to the city defenses. The German offensive was already four days old and progressing rapidly from the north when, on 24 February, it came within reach of Fort Douaumont. Fort Douaumont was still only manned by a maintenance crew of only 56 troops and a few gunners. The highest-ranked soldier in the fort was an NCO named Chenot. On 25 February, elements of the German 24th Brandenburg Regiment (6 Infanterie-Division, III Armeekorps) approached Fort Douaumont from the north, as a reconnaissance or raiding party. Most of the French garrison had already gone to the lower levels of the fort to escape the incessant German shelling with large-calibre guns. A battery of super-heavy 420 mm M-Ger√§t howitzers was intermittently pounding the fort, damaging the 75 mm gun turret. The occupants had been without communication with the outside world for some time. The observation cupolas were unoccupied. Only a small gunnery team was manning the 155 mm gun turret which was firing at distant targets. The dry moats which could have been swept by French machine-gun fire from the wall \\"casemates\\" or \\"coffres\\" had been left undefended. About 10 combat engineers from the Brandenburg regiment, led by Pioneer-Sergeant Kunze, managed to approach the fort unopposed. Visibility was poor due to bad weather, and French machine gunners in the village of Douaumont thought the Germans were French colonial troops returning from a patrol. Kunze and his men reached the moat and found that the wall casemates (coffres) defending the moat were unoccupied. Kunze managed to climb inside one of them to open a door. Kunze's men refused to go inside the fortification as they feared an ambush. Armed only with a rifle, the Pioneer- Sergeant entered alone. He wandered around the empty tunnels until he found the artillery team, captured them and locked them up. By now, another group from the Brandenburg regiment, led by reserve-officer Lieutenant Radtke, was also entering the fort through its unoccupied defences. Radtke then made contact with Kunze's troops and organised them before they spread out, capturing a few more French defenders and securing the fort. Later, more columns of German troops under Hauptman Haupt and Oberleutnant von Brandis arrived. No shots were ever fired in the capture of Fort Douaumont. The only casualty was one of Kunze's men who scraped a knee. Despite being the last officer to enter the fort, von Brandis was the one who dispatched the report on the capture of Douaumont to the German High Command. A few days later, the Prussian officer was telling Crown Prince Wilhelm about its heroic seizure. No mention was made of the efforts of Lieutenant Radtke or Sergeant Kunze. Instead von Brandis became the \\"Hero of Douaumont\\" and was awarded the Pour le M√©rite, (Hauptman Haupt received it later, too). Kunze, who broke in and locked up the garrison and Radtke, who took command during the fort's capture, received no award. It was not until the 1930s, after historians from the German Great War committee had time to review the capture of Fort Douaumont that credit was belatedly given. Kunze, now a member of the Ordnungspolizei, received a promotion and Lieutenant Radtke got an autographed portrait of Wilhelm, the former Crown Prince and Kunze received the order of Pour le M√©rite. Douaumont, the keystone of the system of forts that was to protect Verdun against a German invasion, had been given up without a fight. In the words of one French divisional commander, its loss would cost the French army 100,000 lives. Douaumont's easy fall was a disaster for the French and a glaring example of the lack of judgment prevailing in the General Staff at the time, under General Joffre. The French General Staff had decided in August 1915 to partially disarm all the Verdun forts, acting under the erroneous assumption that the forts could not resist the effects of modern heavy artillery. After its capture, Douaumont became an invulnerable shelter and operational base for German forces just behind their front line. The German soldiers at Verdun came to refer to the place as \\"Old Uncle Douaumont\\". =Recapture= The French Second Army made a first attempt to recapture the fort in late May 1916. They occupied the western end of the fort for 36 hours but were dislodged after suffering heavy losses, mostly from German artillery and trench mortars nearby. The Germans stubbornly held onto the fort, as it provided shelter for troops and served as first aid station and supply dump. French artillery continued to shell the fort, turning the area into a pockmarked moonscape, traces of which are still visible. On 8 May 1916, an unattended cooking fire had detonated grenades and flamethrower fuel, which detonated an ammunition cache. Apparently some of the soldiers tried to heat coffee using flamethrower fuel, which proved to be too flammable and spread to shells which were without caution placed right next to such environments. A firestorm ripped through the fort, killing hundreds of soldiers instantly, including the 12th Grenadiers regimental staff. Some of the 1,800 wounded and soot-blackened survivors attempting to escape from the inferno, were mistaken for French colonial infantry and were fired upon by their comrades; 679 German soldiers perished in this fire.Mosier, John. \\"Verdun: The Lost History of the Most Important Battle of World War I, 1914-1918.\\" Penguin Group: USA, 2013. Page 302. Centenary article by Tony Rennell. Their remains were gathered inside the fort at the time and placed into a casemate which was walled off. The site is underground, inside the fort and has long been an official German war grave. A commemorative plaque in German and a cross stand at the foot of the grave's sealing wall, which is open to visitors. A French offensive involving three infantry divisions began on 24 October 1916, to recapture the fort. This took place on the same day and was carried out by the elite R√©giment d'infanterie-chars de marine (At that time designated the R√©giment d'infanterie coloniale du Maroc, R.I.C.M (Regiment of Colonial Infantry of Morocco)). Douaumont had been pounded for days by two super heavy long-range French railway guns named \\"Alsace\\" and \\"Lorraine\\", emplaced at Baleycourt, south-west of Verdun. Douaumont had become untenable under their fire and was in the process of being evacuated when it was recaptured. Millions of smaller shells had been fired at the fort since its capture by the Germans to little avail and tens of thousands of men had died in attempts to recapture it.

The town lies north of Avignon on the right bank of the Rh√¥ne. In the 2012 census the commune had a population of 5,421. Roquemaure was the site of a royal castle during the medieval period but after the French Revolution the castle was dismantled and now only two towers remain. In the 18th century Roquemaure was the centre of attempts to regulate the production of wine in the area and the term \\"C√¥te du Rh√¥ne\\" was coined. The town is infamous for being the site where phylloxera, a pest of grapevines, was introduced into France from North America in the 1860s. Viticulture is still an important activity in the commune. Several types of wine are produced including some classified as C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e. Geography Roquemaure lies on the right (west) bank of the Rh√¥ne, at the eastern end of a narrow limestone ridge, the Montagne de Saint Geni√®s, that rises abruptly from the flat alluvial plain and extends for in an east-west direction. The town is north of Avignon, south-southeast of Orange and west of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape which lies on the other side of the Rh√¥ne. The town is the administrative centre (chef-lieu) of the canton of Roquemaure, one of 24 cantons of the Arrondissement of N√Æmes. The canton consists of nine communes: Laudun-l'Ardoise, Lirac, Montfaucon, Roquemaure, Saint-Geni√®s-de-Comolas, Saint-Laurent-des-Arbres, Saint-Victor-la-Coste, Tavel and Sauveterre.. Toponym The name Roquemaure is believed to be derived from the Occitan r√≤ca (rock) + maura (feminine adjective black). Early Latin manuscripts use a variety of spellings for the name of the town. In 1539 the Ordinance of Villers-Cotter√™ts specified that French was to be used in official documents. The current French spelling is used in a manuscript dating from 1550. History Detail from a map published in 1627 showing the castle of Roquemaure on a rock within the Rh√¥ne =Hannibal= In 218 BC, at the start of the Second Punic War, Hannibal crossed the Rh√¥ne with his army and war elephants in his journey from the Iberian peninsula to northern Italy. The classical historians Polybius and Livy each provide accounts of the journey, but the exact route has been the source of much scholarly debate. Roquemaure is one of several locations that have been proposed for the crossing. =Gallo-Roman villa= Archaeological excavations undertaken in 1996 ahead of the construction of a new high speed railway line (TGV) uncovered the remains of a Gallo-Roman villa and 35 burials at a site northwest of the town, just to the south of the Roc de Peillet, a small limestone outcrop on the old alluvial terrace of the Rh√¥ne called Les Rami√®res. The earliest finds date from the Augustan period (63 BC-14 AD). The site was abandoned during the 7th century. =Roquemaure castle= In the medieval period Roquemaure was the site of an important castle that stood on a limestone outcrop in the Rh√¥ne. The surviving ruins include two towers, the Square Tower (Tour carr√©e) and the Round Tower (Tour ronde) that date from the 12th and 13th centuries. Next to the Round Tower are the remains of a toll collector's house that dates from the same period. The ruins are currently privately owned.. On the opposite bank of the Rh√¥ne is a similar limestone outcrop on which sits the ruins of another medieval castle, the Ch√¢teau de l'Hers. In the medieval period the Rh√¥ne was somewhat wider at this point than it is today and both castles sat on islands within the river. The first written record of the Roquemaure castle dates from 1209, on eve of the Albigensian Crusade. The castle at the time was controlled by Raymond VI of Toulouse but on being accused by Pope Innocent III of sheltering heretics, he agreed to donate seven castles, including that of Roquemaure (castrum de Roccamaura), to the papal legate in Avignon. A document from four years later (1213) mentions a tower and a cistern. The tower is almost certainly the existing Square Tower that dominates the ruins. In 1229 the castle was acquired by the French king, Louis IX, in the Treaty of Paris. There are no surviving 13th century documents that give details on the construction of the castle but it is clear from records of the money spent on maintenance that by the beginning of the 14th century the castle included a curtain wall crowned with a parapet that sheltered a number of houses as well as an oven, a large well, a garden containing a second well, a chapel and prisons. The castle occupied an important position on the border of the territory ruled by the French crown, as at the time, the papacy controlled the Comtat Venaissin on the opposite bank of the Rh√¥ne. During the 14th and 15th centuries the castle was the only residence with suitable accommodation for high-ranking dignitaries near the river between Pont-Saint-Esprit and Beaucaire; the Fort Saint-Andr√© and the Tour Philippe-le -Bel in Villeneuve- l√®s-Avignon served only a military function. During this period Roquemaure castle hosted a series of important guests. In 1314, Pope Clement V, the first pope to be based in Avignon, died at the castle when travelling from Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape to his birthplace in Gascony. Later in the 14th century, Louis I, Duke of Anjou was a frequent visitor. He was the second son of John II of France and brother of Charles V of France. He used the castle as a base for his negotiations with the popes in Avignon. In 1385 John, Duke of Berry entertained a Hungarian ambassador at the castle while four years later in 1389 Charles VI stayed with a large entourage. Then in 1420 his son Charles Dauphin of Viennois visited the castle. He would become Charles VII of France on his father's death in 1422. Although regularly maintained in this period, the castle gradually ceased to have its earlier importance. In 1590-1591 during the French Wars of Religion the castle came under siege and parts of towers and walls were destroyed. Subsequently, Louis XIV failed to maintain the building and it fell into a state of disrepair. At the beginning of the 18th century the arm of the Rh√¥ne flowing between the castle and the right bank silted up so that instead of sitting on an island the castle now stood on the bank of the river near the town. After the revolution the ruined castle was sold off in lots and used as a source of stone for other buildings. A plan dating from 1752 shows that the castle was entirely constructed on the limestone outcrop. The fortifications included seven round towers of which only the most northerly tower survives. The remaining square tower is in height and in width. On the limestone base it rises above the town. =Port on the Rh√¥ne= At least from the middle of the 17th century, and probably much earlier, the port was situated to the west of the castle at a position near the present car park and the Cave Granier in the l‚ÄôEscatillon district of the town. During the 18th century the river deposited silt around the √éle de M√©imart which increased in size and eventually blocked access to the port. In the 19th century attempts were made to construct a new port just to the north of the Square Tower but the build-up of silt limited the depth of water.. =Flooding of the town= Roquemaure was vulnerable to flooding by the Rh√¥ne and on the southern wall of the church there are marks recording the height of the water in the major floods of 1755 and 1840 when most of the town would have been under more than one meter of water. There was another very destructive flood in May‚ÄìJune 1856.. In 1860 the French state agreed to pay two thirds of the cost of the construction of a dyke to protect the town.. The dyke began at the Colline Saint-Jean and followed the river south to the village of Sauveterre. It protected the town during the severe flooding of 1935. After World War II the Compagnie Nationale du Rh√¥ne began canalizing the river. The section near Roquemaure was completed in the early 1970s. =Bridge across the Rh√¥ne= In 1835 work began on the construction of a suspension bridge over the Rh√¥ne at Roquemaure. At the time there was no bridge across the river between Avignon and Pont-Saint-Esprit.; The bridge was destroyed by American aircraft in August 1944 during World War II.. A chain ferry was then operated across the river until 1959 when the current bridge was opened.. =Railway station= The railway station in Roquemaure was opened in August 1880 on the line running between Le Teil and Gr√©zan-N√Æmes on the right bank of the Rh√¥ne. The station closed in August 1973 when passenger transport on the line ceased. The line has since been electrified and is now used for freight.. Church The western end of the parish church An engraved marble slab dating from the 15th century that is set into the church wall. The Catholic collegiate church of Saint-Jean-Baptiste and Saint-Jean-l‚ÄôEvang√©liste dates from the first half of the 14th century. It was built in the southern gothic style (gothique m√©ridional) and replaced an earlier church dedicated to Sainte-Marie. The construction of the present church was initiated by Bertrand du Pouget, a powerful figure in the church hierarchy in the early period of the Avignon Papacy. He was appointed as the cardinal priest of San Marcello by Pope Jean XXII in 1316 and the cardinal bishop of Ostia e Velletri in 1327.. In 1345 Pope Clement VI authorised the transfer of the parish services from Sainte-Marie to the new church and the establishment of a collegiate chapter consisting of ten priests and two canons. One of the canons was charged with the spiritual care of the congregation. The chapter was relatively wealthy as it inherited the benefices of the earlier church and gained addition endowments from the founder. Originally the wooden roof was visible in the church but in the 19th century the timbers were replaced and the vaulting was added. The third chapel on the right hand side of the nave is the Chapel Saint-Jean which dates from the 15th century. In 1855 a marble slab was discovered under layers of whitewash in the wall. The slab has an engraving of a man and a Latin inscription around three sides; the slab is damaged and the inscription on the fourth side is missing. The text reads: \\"This is the tomb of the noble master [and] professor of both laws, Lord Jordanus Bricius, Lord of the castles of Velaux and Ch√¢teauneuf-le-Rouge, who was chief judge of Provence, and had built...\\" Unfortunately the date which presumably would have been on the fourth side and is missing. Velaux and Ch√¢teauneuf-le-Rouge are communes in the department of the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne. The stone is now set into the nearby wall of the church. Jordanus Bricius, whose name is usual written in French as Jourdain Brice, was an important judge and legal scholar. He is believed to have died in either 1433 or 1439.. The historian Eug√®ne Germer- Durand when reporting the discovery of the slab suggested that his family name may have been Br√®s which in the Proven√ßal dialect is similar to the word for a type of trap used to catch birds.. This could explain the crest on the slab which includes a small bird above three objects that could be traps. Jourdain Br√®s may have been born locally as the family name of Br√®s existed in the neighbouring village of Laudun in the 17th century. The church contains an organ made in 1690 by the brothers Barth√©l√©my and Honor√© Julien from Marseille. It was originally installed in the Couvent des Cordeliers in Avignon but was moved to the church in Roquemaure in around 1820.. The walnut casing dates from when the organ was moved. In the chapel to the right of the main altar is a casket containing some relics of Saint Valentine. These were extracted from the catacomb of Saint Hippolytus in Rome and given by Pope Pius IX to Maximilien Pichaud, a local dignitary. They were placed in the church in a ceremony led by Claude-Henri Plantier, the bishop of N√Æmes, in October 1868.. Chapels ;Chapel of Saint-Agricol d'Albaret The ruins of the Chapel Saint-Agricol d'Albaret are southwest of the town next to the A9 autoroute. The chapel was once part of a priory belonging to the Benedictine Abbey of Saint-Andr√© in Villeneuve-l√®s-Avignon. The word \\"Albaret\\" is the name of a small village that was served by the chapel in the Middle Ages. The earliest mention of the priory is when the benefice was donated to the bishop of Avignon sometime between 1104 and 1110. The bishop passed on the benefice to the Abbey of Saint-Andr√©. The records show that in 1845 the building was in a reasonable state of repair and that in 1881 a mass was celebrated in the chapel. The chapel has a semi-circular apse at the eastern end which is built of carefully laid stonework. The choir is similarly well constructed except high up where rubble masonry is used. The two buttresses at the western end of the choir show evidence of having been modified. The walls of the nave, which now lacks a roof, are built with irregular blocks of stone. The western door, which is surmounted by a niche and an oculus, appear to date from the 17th century. The chapel must have once had a graveyard as excavations carried out in 1989 in an area to the southeast unearthed 22 burials dating from the High Middle Ages. The oldest parts of the chapel are in the early Romanesque style and probably date from the 11th century. The choir was reconstructed in the 12th century and then in the 17th century the building was restored and the murals added. Chapel of Saint Joseph des Champs ;Chapel of Saint-Sauveur in Truel The Chapel of Saint-Sauveur is in the hamlet of Truel which is south of the Roquemaure. This chapel was also once part of a priory belonging to the Abbey of Saint-Andr√©. It is now a private house. The chapel differs from others belonging to the abbey in having a more complex architecture and a plan in the form of a Latin cross. ;Chapel of Saint Joseph des Champs The Chapel of Saint Joseph des Champs is southwest of the town on the south side of the D976 to Tavel. Roman shards have been uncovered nearby suggesting that the chapel may have been built on the site of an earlier Roman building. Population In 1384 Roquemaure was the chef-lieu of one of the 13 vigueries in the s√©n√©chauss√©e of Beaucaire and N√Æmes. It was the site of a royal castle and a large collegiate church with 10 priests. In spite of this, the village itself was very small with only 5 hearths. Within the Roquemaure viguerie Lirac had 3 hearths, Tavel 5, Saint-Geni√®s-de-Comolas 13 and Saint-Laurent-des-Arbres 30. Bagnols-sur-C√®ze was the chef-lieu of a neighbouring viguerie and had 115 hearths. Four centuries later in 1789, on the eve of the French Revolution, Roquemaure had 929 hearths and was similar in size to Bagnol which had 1085. Wine Winemaking was probably introduced into Rh√¥ne valley by Greek colonists around 600 BC.. Archaeological excavations carried out at La Rami√®re suggests that wine, or possibly olive oil, was being produced at the site in the second half of the 1st century AD.. The earliest written mention of viticulture in Roquemaure is by Gervase of Tilbury in his Otia Imperialia which was completed around 1214. An English translation of the Latin text is: > In the Rh√¥ne stands the castle of Roquemaure. They judge that the castle > itself belongs to the empire, which has rights over the river, while its > estate belongs to the kingdom of France, which owns the land-rights. On the > estate of this castle there are vines which the people call brumestae, > producing good fat grapes. These vines flower and produce clusters of grapes > as ordinary vines do, but then they cheat their husbandman's expectation: > for when it comes to the feast of St John the Baptist [24 June], all the > fruit vanishes, and nothing which might have grown into fruit is found on > them. The earliest mention of wine being exported from Roquemaure is in the accounts of the papal court in Avignon of Innocent VI. In 1357 they record the purchase of 20 barrels from \\"Guillelmo Malrepacis\\", a local merchant. The port on the Rh√¥ne allowed wine produced in Roquemaure and the surrounding villages to be easily exported. In 1735 more than 8,000 barrels a year were being shipped from the port. The current law for the C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e dates only from 1937, but there is a long history of attempts to regulate the quality of the wine from the region. In 1737 the Conseil d'Etat issued a royal decree on the production of wine in Roquemaure. It specified that neither wine nor harvested grapes could be brought into town from outside the area and to prevent wines from a poor vintage being passed off as coming from a better vintage, barrels of wine from Roquemaure and the surrounding villages had to be marked on one end using a hot iron, with the letters \\"CDR\\" for C√¥te du Rh√¥ne and the year. The surrounding villages were listed as Tavel, Lirac, Saint-Laurent-des-Arbres, Saint-Geni√®s-de-Comolas, Orsan, Chusclan, Codolet and \\"others of high quality\\". The decree also suggested that it would help to prevent fraud if the barrels were marked with the name of the parish of origin. Another decree issued in the same year complained about the poor quality of the barrels used for the wine and specified that they should be manufactured in two standard sizes. =Phylloxera= Roquemaure is believed to be the site where phylloxera, an insect that attacks the roots of grapevines, was first introduced into France from North America. In 1862 a local wine merchant, Mr. Borty, received a case containing rooted American vines from a New York vine-grower, Mr. Carle. This case contained native grapevines, including 'Clinton', 'Post-Oak', and 'Emily'. Mr. Borty, planted these American vines in ten rows within his walled garden at 21 rue Longue (renamed rue Placide Cappeau). The following summer in a vineyard at the nearby village of Pujaut, a number of vines began to die. By 1864 Borty's own Grenache and Alicante vines were showing symptoms of phylloxera infection. All the vines in the neighbouring village of Pujaut were either dead or dying by 1865 and the initial infection had spread to the towns of Orange and St-R√©my. By the end of 1868 the whole of the lower Rh√¥ne Valley was infected and by 1890 phylloxera had spread across most of France. =Winemaking cooperative= The cellars of the Vignerons de Roquemaure The winemaking cooperative, \\"Les Vignerons de Roquemaure\\", was established in 1922 and in 2013 had 60 members who together cultivated of vineyard spread over nine different communes.. Roughly half the vineyards are classed as Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e (AOC) and the remainder as Indication G√©ographique Prot√©g√©e (IGP).. The cooperative produces several types of wine or appellation with each appellation having an associated set of legal regulations.. The most restrictive appellation is for the cru or vintage wines that are labelled as \\"Tavel\\" or \\"Lirac\\". Tavel is a small village southwest of Roquemaure that produces grapes for ros√© wines.Wine made from grapes grown within vineyards of the Domaine de Manissy that lie just within the commune of Roquemaure are also labelled as Tavel.. Lirac is a small village to the west of Roquemaure, but the wines labelled as \\"Lirac\\" come from grapes grown in of designated vineyards that are scattered over the four communes of Lirac, Roquemaure, Saint-Laurent-des-Arbres and Saint-Geni√®s- de-Comolas. AOC Lirac is produced by 44 winemakers and 5 different cooperatives including the cooperative in Roquemaure... The cooperative in Roquemaure also produces a wine classified as \\"C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne Villages\\" with the village specified as Laudun. Laudun is northwest of Roquemaure and is one of 18 villages in the \\"C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne Villages\\" appellation that is allowed to add the village name.. Wines with the C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne appellation are produced using grapes grown in vineyards designated as suitable.. Vineyards outside these \\"C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne\\" designated areas are used to produce wines classed as Indication G√©ographique Prot√©g√©e. The vineyards for Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e wines are planted with traditional grape varieties: Grenache, Syrah, Mourv√®dre and Carignan for red wines, Clairette, Viognier, Grenache blanc and Bourboulenc for white wines. The proportions allowed of each variety are specified in the regulations for each appellation. The regulations for red wines specify a minimum percentage of Grenache grapes of between 40 and 50 percent. For the Indication G√©ographique Prot√©g√©e category a wider range of grape varieties are grown including \\"international\\" varieties such as Merlot, Cabernet-Sauvignon and Chardonnay. Schools There are three state schools in Roquemaure. The nursery school, L'√âcole maternelle Francette Prade, is attended by around 200 children between the ages of three and six. The primary school, Jean Vilar and Albert Camus, is attended by 330 children between the ages of six and eleven while the secondary school, Coll√®ge Paul Val√©ry, is attended by 650 children up to the age of fifteen. Older children attend a Lyc√©e in one of the nearby towns to study for the Baccalaur√©at. The nearest is the Lyc√©e Jean Vilar in Villeneuve-l√®s-Avignon. Local events A weekly market is held every Tuesday morning on the Place de la Pousterle. An annual festival (F√™te Votive) is held in the village around the 16 August, the feast day of Saint Roch. A travelling funfair occupies the Place de la Pousterle, and local associations organise outdoor evening meals with live music. A popular event is the running of young bulls through the narrow streets of the town.

J.\\" Rodgers (born March 15, 1948) is an American scientist and entrepreneur. He is the founder of Cypress Semiconductor and holds patents ranging from semiconductors to energy to winemaking. Rodgers is known for his public relations acumen, brash personality, and strong advocacy of laissez- faire capitalism. He stepped down as Cypress CEO in April 2016 and Director in August 2016 after serving for 34 years. Early life Rodgers was born on March 15, 1948 in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. He goes back to nearby Green Bay, Wisconsin several times a year to attend Green Bay Packers football games.https://www.sfgate.com/living/article/A-DAY-IN-THE-LIFE-OF-T-J- Rodgers-2734685.php His father was a car salesman and worked for General Motors and his mother was a school teacher, with a master's degree in radio electronics. He was a Sloan scholar at Dartmouth College and played on the Dartmouth Big Green football team.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1991-12-08/the-bad-boy-of- silicon-valley In 1970 he received his bachelor's degree, graduating as salutatorian with majors in chemistry and physics. He received his master's degree (1973) and Ph.D. (1975) in electrical engineering from Stanford University. While pursuing his Ph.D. degree, Rodgers invented the VMOS process technology, which he later licensed to American Microsystems, Inc. He founded Cypress Semiconductor in 1982. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Universidad Francisco Marroqu√≠n in Guatemala City. Career After finishing a doctorate at Stanford, he turned down a job offer from Intel, saying that CEO Andrew S. Grove was unlikely to give him the freedom to pursue his own projects. Instead Rodgers accepted a job at American Microsystems, Inc. (AMI), where he continued working on a special chip technology he invented at Stanford, but this project was a failure. =Cypress Semiconductor= Rodgers founded Cypress Semiconductor in 1982 and served as founding CEO. Cypress is a semiconductor design and manufacturing company, producing PSoCs, microcontroller, IoT, wireless and USB, PMICs, memory and sensor chips. As CEO, Rodgers was responsible for more than 30 acquisitions, including SunPower and the IoT portfolio of Broadcom Corporation. Cypress also benefited from its business with Apple Inc., as its PSoC was behind the iPod click wheel. He stepped down as CEO in April 2016. In 2015, Cypress had more than 6,000 employees and revenues of US$1.6 billion. The company had about 7,000 issued patents and about 1,200 additional patent applications on record. Proxy fight In 2017 Rodgers conducted a successful proxy fight against Cypress. He raised concerns pertaining to director compensation, state-sponsored foreign competition as well as inherent conflicts of interest. After filing a lawsuit against the company in April 2017, Rodgers sought to remove executive chairman Ray Bingham and Eric Benhamou from the Cypress board and nominated Dan McCranie and Camillo Martino as directors. Rodgers argued that Bingham's role as a co-founder of Canyon Bridge, a private equity fund supported by the Government of China, constituted a clear conflict- of interest as acquisition targets for both companies overlapped. Bingham was forced to resign from the Cypress board in early June 2017 and both of Rodgers' nominees won the subsequent 2017 shareholder election against Benhamou. =SunPower= Rodgers early recognized the value of high efficiency solar cells produced by SunPower. As SunPower faced financial problems in 2001, Rodgers tried to convince the Cypress board to buy the solar cell producer. Rodgers and SunPower CEO Richard Swanson had met in the 70s at Stanford University. But as the Cypress board of directors was not interested in saving the struggling company Rodgers wrote a check himself for $750,000. About a year later Rodgers had convinced the board to invest $9 million in SunPower and a few months later Cypress bought a majority stake in SunPower. In 2005 SunPower went public and reached a market capitalization of $10.4 billion in 2007. From May 2002 to May 2011, Rodgers served as chairman of SunPower. =Enphase Energy= In January 2017, Rodgers invested US$5 million in Enphase Energy, a renewable energy firm specialized in energy management and the production of solar micro-inverters, which transform solar energy to alternating current for the electrical grid. In addition to his investment, Rodgers joined Enphase's board of directors. =Board memberships= Bloom Energy, a fuel cell producer * Enovix, producer of silicon lithium-ion batteries * Enphase Energy, energy technology company * WaterBit, precision agriculture company * FTC Solar, a renewable energy company * Bespoken Spirits Inc., a beverage technology company Rodgers also served as director of the Semiconductor Industry Association. Trustee of Dartmouth College After successfully launching a petition drive to get his name on the ballot, Rodgers won the alumni trustee election of Dartmouth College in 2004, becoming the first successful petition candidate since 1980. He won with a comfortable margin. As trustee, Rodgers‚Äô major concerns were removing the College's speech code, increasing the budget for teacher salaries and strengthening Dartmouth's focus on undergraduate education. Following the campaign of Rodgers, three additional independent trustees were elected in 2005 and 2007. Rodgers was reelected as trustee in 2009. Clos de la Tech Rodgers began winemaking in 1996 on a one-acre vineyard surrounding his house in Woodside. Later he bought two additional vineyards and, along with his wife Valeta, Rodgers established the winery Clos de la Tech in the Santa Cruz Mountains of Silicon Valley. Clos de la Tech uses old French winemaking techniques of Domaine de la Roman√©e-Conti to make five Pinot Noir wines. This includes stomping the grapes with feet and siphoning the wine by hand. Also, no mechanized pumps are used. Clos de la Tech combines these old techniques with high tech monitoring and measures to optimize the conditions for the crops and to handle grapes and wine as gently as possible. Clos de la Tech's Pinot Noirs have been rated up to 96 points by Wine Enthusiast Magazine. As winemaker, Rodgers invented a patented wine press and computer monitored fermenters. He also designed and built the first wireless wine fermentation network, comprising 152 fermenters, and donated the system worth US$3.5 million to the UC Davis winery. Rodgers on Diversity In 1996, Rodgers made headlines when Sister Doris Gormley, the Director of Corporate Social Responsibility for The Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia, sent him a form letter encouraging him to hire women and minorities on the Cypress board. He replied with a long letter defending his hiring practices and philosophy. In 1999, he wrote an editorial in the San Jose Mercury News denouncing Jesse Jackson's attack on Cypress Semiconductor on what Jackson claimed was discriminatory hiring practices. Personal life Rodgers is an avid jogger and wine enthusiast. He is a supporter of several charities, including Second Harvest Food Bank, and served as a trustee on the Dartmouth College Board of Trustees from 2004 to 2012. He is the husband of Valeta Massey.http://www.mercurynews.com/portal/news/ci_15844839 Awards and recognition 1986: * Entrepreneur of the Year by City of Santa Clara, California 1988: * ENCORE (Entrepreneurial Company of the Year) Award from the Stanford University Business School 1996: * \\"CEO of the year\\" ‚Äì Financial World 1997 * Outstanding Individual Entrepreneurship Award from the U.S. Association for Small Business and Entrepreneurship 2000: * Award from the Healing Institute for his support of the Carver Scholars Program 2001: * Cited as one of the \\"100 People Who Changed Our World.\\" by Upside * Silicon Valley Capitalism Award for \\"exemplifying the virtues of capitalism and defending capitalism with ethical principles in the media.\\" * Angel Award by the International Angel Investors organization for his venture-capital activities supporting the semiconductor industry * Entrepreneur of the Year Award from the Smith Center for Private Enterprise Studies at California State University, Hayward 2002: * \\"Top 100 Chief Executives\\" by Chief Executive 2005 : * Inducted into the Silicon Valley Engineering Council Hall of Fame. 2006: * Honored with a Fellow Award from the International Engineering Consortium. 2009: * Spirit of Ireland Award Patents 1975 US3878552 ‚Äì Bipolar Integrated Circuit and Method US3924265 ‚Äì Low capacitance V groove MOS NOR gate and method of manufacture 1976 US3975221 ‚Äì Low capacitance V groove MOS NOR gate and method of manufacture 1980 US4222063 ‚Äì VMOS Floating gate memory with breakdown voltage loweringregion US4222062 ‚Äì VMOS Floating gate memory device 1981 CA1115426 ‚Äì U-groove mos device 1988 US5835401 ‚Äì DRAM with hidden refresh US4764248 ‚Äì Rapid thermal nitridized oxide locos process 1999 US5977638 ‚Äì Edge metal for interconnect layers 2000 US6131140 ‚Äì Integrated cache memory with system control logic and adaptation of RAM bus to a cache pinout 2001 US6185126 ‚Äì Self-initializing RAM-based programmable device 2004 US6835616 ‚Äì Method of forming a floating metal structure in an integratedcircuit US6730545 ‚Äì Method of performing back-end manufacturing of an integrated circuit device US2004076712 ‚Äì Fermentation tank wine press 2005 US6903002 ‚Äì Low-k dielectric layer with air gaps US6847218 ‚Äì Probe card with an adapter layer for testing integrated circuits 2006 US7045387 ‚Äì Method of performing back-end manufacturing of an integrated circuit 2007 US7227804 ‚Äì Current source architecture for memory device standby current reduction 2008 US2008315847 - Programmable floating gate reference US2008102160 - Wine-making press 2009 US7507944 ‚Äì Non-planar packaging of image sensor 2017 US9624094 ‚Äì Hydrogen barriers in a copper interconnect process Bibliography References External links ‚Äì A debate between John Mackey, Milton Friedman, and T.J.

M√§rket has been divided between the two countries since the Treaty of Fredrikshamn of 1809 defined the border between Sweden and the Russian Empire as going through the middle of the island. The Finnish side of the island is part of the Municipality of Hammerland and is the westernmost land point of Finland.citizen's Map Site ‚Äì National Land Survey of Finland The Swedish part of the island is itself divided by two counties of Sweden: Uppsala County (√ñsthammar Municipality) and Stockholm County (Norrt√§lje Municipality). Geography and history M√§rket Island with the national border and the county border Location of M√§rket Island The Understen-M√§rket Passage links the Bothnian Sea to the Baltic proper. The skerry is roughly long by wide, and its area is about . It is the smallest sea island shared by two countries.World island superlatives The name M√§rket ('the Mark') probably comes from its usefulness as a navigation mark before there were lighthouses. The route between Sweden and √Öland has a passage about (17 mi) long over open sea. Before the lighthouse was erected, the island and its shallows were dangerous navigational hazards, which seafarers tried desperately to avoid. In 1873, as many as 23 ships were grounded on the Swedish coast and its archipelago trying to avoid M√§rket, and eight of them were shipwrecked.Tom Backmansson, 1998. TV series \\"Fyren - Majakka\\", episode 10: M√§rket. First shown on Yle TV1, 16.7.2000 17.59. Produced by Yleisradio Oy, http://areena.yle.fi/1-682613 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytNqj9QfG70 M√§rket is detached from the main √Öland archipelago, with the closest island more than away, and the closest harbor, Berghamn, away in Ecker√∂. There is no deep harbor; the island can only be reached with boats. There are small, barely surfacing rocks northwest of M√§rket, called M√§rketsh√§llor (\\"stones of M√§rket\\"), which are too small to sustain vegetation. The island consists of mostly smooth diabase rock, with a maximum natural elevation of two meters. Most of the area is regularly washed over with seawater in storms, and scoured by drift ice in winter. Plant life, which is limited to low-growing grasses and herbs, persists only in some protected spots. Twenty-three plant species have been identified altogether. The halophilic grass Puccinellia capillaris and the herbaceous Sagina nodosa (knotted pearlwort) are found scattered throughout the island. Among rarer species, Spergularia marina (salt sandspurry) grows on M√§rket. Salix caprea (goat willow) grows on an abandoned building. There are large grey seal communities around M√§rket, and the island has been a target for seal safaris. International border and lighthouse There is a lighthouse on the Finnish side of the current border, which has been unmanned and automated since 1979. When it was built by the Grand Duchy of Finland (then part of the Russian Empire) in 1885, the island was considered a no-man's land, so the lighthouse was simply built upon the highest point of the island. However, the location selected was within the Swedish portion of the island. As a result, the border was adjusted in 1985 so that the lighthouse is now located on Finnish territory.M√§rket ‚Äì a remarkable island by Joakim Ekman, Lars-Gunnar Br√•vander, Gabriel Ekmand, and Ebbe Zachrisson includes a map of the island The adjustment was carried out such that no net transfer of territory occurred, and the ownership of the coastline was unchanged so as not to interfere with each country's fishing rights. This resulted in an unusual shape for the international border to satisfy both Finnish and Swedish interests. The adjusted border takes the form of an inverted 'S', and the lighthouse is connected to the rest of Finland only by a short stretch of land. The border is regularly resurveyed every 25 years by officials representing both countries. The last such joint inspection took place in August 2006.Shifting Territories: M√§rket Reef, Hidden Europe Magazine, 11 (November 2006), pp. 26‚Äì29. The border is marked by holes drilled into the rock, because the seasonal drift ice would shear off any protruding markers. Because of the Nordic Passport Union and the Schengen Agreement, there have been no passport checks or other border formalities at the border since 1958, so intra- Nordic/intra-Schengen visitors may visit the island freely. Both sides are officially monolingual, with Swedish as the language of the island. The lighthouse is in urgent need of maintenance, and a Finnish interest group is trying to raise funds for its preservation. The lighthouse has been automated since 1979 and the surrounding buildings are no longer used. The increasing general availability of GPS has made the lighthouse's primary function redundant.  Radio amateurs activity  Radio amateurs around the world consider the Finnish part of M√§rket Reef (as they call it) a separate entity, distinct from Finland and Sweden. The Finnish part of M√§rket Reef used to be one of the world's most desired \\"countries\\" among radio amateurs because of its special status and relative remoteness. One or more amateur radio expeditions to the island occur most years, weather permitting. During these expeditions, tens of thousands of radio contacts are made with people in several parts of the world. At high seas, landing is only possible with a helicopter. Good pictures of M√§rket are shown on QSL cards. The official prefix for use on the Finnish side is OH0, as in the rest of the √Öland Islands, but OJ0 is the optional call sign prefix for M√§rket Reef. There is a fee for using an OJ0 call sign, while the use of the OH0/ prefix in front of the own call sign is free. All radio activity on the island is by visitors on DX-peditions. When the Finnish part of the reef was given its special status in amateur radio, in the late 1960s the lighthouse keeper himself became a licensed amateur radio operator who initially used the call OH0MA. On the Swedish side of M√§rket Reef the call signs 8S9M and SI8MI have been used.  Climate  M√§rket has a continental climate affected by oceanic influences; it has a reputation for being one of the windiest places in Finland. Association finlandaise des phares ‚Äì Presentation of the Island A meteorological station has been managed by the lighthouse keepers since 1896, and an automatic station of the Finnish Meteorological Institute was inaugurated on November 10, 1977, shortly before its automation. Institut m√©t√©orologique national de Finlande ‚Äì A list and characteristics of the meteorological stations of Finland The effect of the sea is very important to the climate of the island; thermal inertia dramatically reduces the temperature fluctuations during the year compared to those of the continent, and to a lesser extent, those of the central part of Fasta √Öland, the largest island of the archipelago of √Öland. M√§rket holds five records for daytime temperatures among Finnish weather stations, all in the period between November 29 and January 1, with on December 15, 2006 and on December 31, 1975.

M. (1971) BBC Pronouncing Dictionary of British Names. Oxford University Press. p. 7. . (12 June 1861 ‚Äì 11 June 1927) was a cricketer who played for Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club and England. Attewell was a medium pace bowler who was renowned for his extraordinary accuracy and economy. On the many sticky or crumbling pitches encountered in his prime Attewell could get on a great deal of spin so as to always beat the bat, whilst his accuracy would make slogging ‚Äì the only way to make runs under such conditions ‚Äì very difficult. He was responsible for the development of \\"off theory\\" ‚Äì bowling wide of the off stump to a packed off-side field to frustrate batsmen on the rapidly improving pitches of the 1890s. At times Attewell was a useful batsman for his county, and he scored 102 against Kent in 1897. It is true that against the extremely fleet-footed Australian batsmen of his time, Attewell was fairly ineffective. Moreover, with bowlers such as Lohmann and J.T. Hearne available who could do all Attewell could, he had trouble maintaining his place at Test level despite all he did for Nottinghamshire and the Marylebone Cricket Club. Attewell first played for Nottinghamshire in 1881 as a result of a strike by senior players such as Alfred Shaw and Fred Morley. He bowled very well but did not establish himself until 1884 after Morley had died, when he took 100 wickets for less than thirteen runs each. From then on, Attewell was always in the front rank of English bowlers, and after Shaw dropped out of the Nottinghamshire eleven in early 1887 he became the undisputed leader of the county's attack. His first Ashes tour was modest, partly owing to the dry weather, but he continued improving in England ‚Äì taking 9 for 23 against Sussex at Trent Bridge in 1886 ‚Äì and toured Australia again in 1887/1888. He proved deadly in a wet La Ni√±a season in minor games, but had no opportunity of showing his deadliness on a sticky wicket at the highest level because Lohmann and Briggs were so effective. However, Attewell's skill and economy, along with the brilliant batting of Shrewsbury, allowed Nottinghamshire to maintain their position as one of the top counties in first-class county cricket right up to the end of 1892. Even when Attewell became the MCC's chief bowler and increased his aggregate of wickets to around 150 from 1889 to 1892, he did not cement his Test spot, and improving pitches and a severe shortage of support bowling caused Attewell's average to blow out to 21 in 1893 ‚Äì and his record of 111 wickets at 17.54 in 1894 was disappointing given how much the pitches helped a bowler of his type. Although for the following three years Attewell did remarkably well on all pitches considering Nottinghamshire had no other bowlers even approaching county standard, the great strength of English bowling meant he was not considered for a Test match after 1891. In 1898, Attewell's tireless bowling at last seemed to lose some of its sting, and he failed to reach 100 wickets for the first time in a decade. The extremely dry summer of 1899 showed Attewell's capacity to bowl and bowl all day really was no more: he took only 29 wickets at the extremely high (even on such pitches) cost of 34.62 ‚Äì in county matches he took just 19 wickets for 38.73 each. Attewell retired at the end of 1899 (apart from an abortive appearance for MCC in August 1900) and became a first-class umpire. He continued in this role on a regular basis until 1909, and even umpired at Lord's in an emergency in 1911. He was the first person in test history to be dismissed for a King pair.

Begun in 1989, it commemorates not only Saint Valentine, whom locals claim as a former resident, but the arrival of his remains in 1868 to Roquemaure's collegiate church reliquary. Celebrations revolve around a return to a 19th- century way of life, including costumes and markets. The relics of St Valentine were purchased in Rome, in hopes of curing the town's diseased vine stocks; within four years they were healed. Today, Roquemaure is home to a winery (Cellar St. Valentine) which produces wines named after the saint. The festival was started by a local priest, Father Ren√© Durieu. Men and women around the village dress as priests and nuns, kissing each other, as well as travelers. Special foods and wines are produced especially for the festival.

It is one of the largest kraits, with a maximum length up to .  Description  The banded krait is easily identified by its alternate black and yellow crossbands, its triangular body cross section, and the marked vertebral ridge consisting of enlarged vertebral shields along its body. The head is broad and depressed. The eyes are black. It has arrowhead-like yellow markings on its otherwise black head and has yellow lips, lores, chin, and throat. The longest banded krait measured was long, but normally the length encountered is . The snake has an entire anal plate and single subcaudals. The tail is small, about one-tenth the length of the snake.Boulenger, George A., (1890), The Fauna of British India including Ceylon and Burma, Reptilia and Batrachia. page 388. The scientific name of the genus is derived from the Kannada/Telugu word 'bangara' in Kannada and 'bangarum' in Telugu, meaning \\"gold\\", referring to the yellow rings around its body. Distribution and habitat The banded krait occurs in the whole of the Indo-Chinese subregion, the Malay peninsula and Indonesian archipelago, and southern China.Smith, Malcolm A. Fauna of British India...Vol III - Serpentes, pages 411 to 413 The species is common in the states of West Bengal, Odisha, Mizoram, Assam and Tripura of India, Nepal and Bangladesh, but becomes progressively uncommon westwards in India.Daniels, J.C. (2002), Book of Indian Reptiles and Amphibians, pp. 134-135. It has been recorded eastwards from central India through Bangladesh, Myanmar, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and southern China (including Hong Kong), Philippines to Malaysia and the main Indonesian islands of Borneo (Java and Sumatra), as well as Singapore. In India, it has been recorded from Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Northeast India, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal. It has recently been recorded from Hassan District in Karnataka, Chalkari, Bokaro District, Jharkhand, Trivandrum, Kerala and Amalapadu, Srikakulam District, Andhra Pradeshhttp://www.deccanherald.com/content/240673/slithering-wonder-black- yellow.html Banded kraits may be seen in a variety of habitats, ranging from forests to agricultural lands. They inhabit termite mounds and rodent holes close to water, and often live near human settlement, especially villages, because of their supply of rodents and water. They prefer the open plains of the countryside. The banded krait has been found in Myanmar up to an altitude of 5000 feet. Behaviour Banded kraits are shy, not typically seen, and are mainly nocturnal. When harassed, they will usually hide their heads under their coils, and do not generally attempt to bite, though at night they are much more active and widely considered to be more dangerous then. During the day, they lie up in grass, pits, or drains. The snakes are lethargic and sluggish even under provocation. They are most commonly seen in the rains. =Food= The banded krait feeds mainly on other snakes, but is also known to eat fish, frogs, skinks, and snake eggs. Among the snakes taken by banded kraits are:  * Sunbeam snake Xenopeltis unicolor * Rainbow water snake Enhydris enhydrisKnierim, Tyler., Barnes, Curt H., Hodges, Cameron., (2017), Natural History Note: Banded Krait (Bungarus fasciatus) diet.

In Myanmar, a female has been dug out while incubating a clutch of eight eggs, four of which hatched in May. Young have been recorded to measure 298 to 311 mm on hatching. The snake is believed to become adult in the third year of its life, at an approximate length of 914 mm.Evans, G.H. (1906):Breeding of the banded krait (Bungarus fasciatus) in Burma. J. Bombay nat. Hist. Soc. 16:519-520 as mentioned in Daniels, J.C. (2002), Book of Indian Reptiles and Amphibians References, ser no 28, pg 219. Venom The venom of the banded krait mainly contains neurotoxins (pre- and postsynaptic neurotoxins) with values of 2.4 mg/kg‚Äî3.6 mg/kg SC, 1.289 mg/kg IV and 1.55 mg/kg IP. The quantity of venom delivered averages out at 20‚Äì114 mg. Engelmann and Obst (1981) list the venom yield at 114 mg (dry weight). The major clinical effects caused by the venom of this species include vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and dizziness. Severe envenomation can lead to respiratory failure and death may occur due to suffocation. A clinical toxicology study gives an untreated mortality rate of 1‚Äî10%, which may be because contact with humans is rare and when bites do occur, the rate of envenomation when biting defensively is thought to be very low. Currently, polyvalent antivenoms are available in India and Indonesia.

Meaning \\"palace\\" in Malay, it is where the President receives and entertains state guests. The Istana is also the working office of the Prime Minister of Singapore. The estate was once part of the extensive nutmeg plantation of Mount Sophia. In 1867, the British colonial government acquired the land and built a mansion to be the official home of the British governor. This continued until 1959 when Singapore was granted self-government, and the governor was replaced by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, who was in turn replaced by the President. History The front fa√ßade of the Istana, which once won accolades from its occupants, writers and visitors =British Colonial Period= Government House of Singapore was built between 1867 and 1869 on the instructions of Sir Harry Saint George Ord, Singapore's first colonial governor after the transfer from the East India Company to the Colonial Office. The architect was Major John Frederick Adolphus McNair. Within the same compound is Sri Temasek, one of several senior colonial officers' residences in the Government House previously assigned to the Colonial Secretary.. Sir Harry's desire for a stately governor's residence arose from his dissatisfaction with the leased housing on Grange Hill and Leonie Hill that Governors had to make do with. An earlier governor's residence on Bukit Larangan (now Fort Canning) known as Government House, a flimsy timber structure once designed and built for Sir Stamford Raffles' residence by George Dromgold Coleman in 1822, had been torn down in 1859 to make way for the fort and was never replaced. Ord's views were met with much resistance amongst his colleagues, as to build a residence of palatial proportions and cost was deemed too extravagant. Ord stood his ground, however, and eventually acquired of land from C. R. Prinsep's nutmeg estate in 1867. Construction began later in the year after the design was finalised in March 1867. Disapproval of Ord's initial plans seemed to have evaporated by the time Government House was completed in 1869, as attested to in a report in The Straits Times on 24 April of that year: It was completed just in time for a visit by the Prince Alfred, the 1st Duke of Edinburgh. The entire Government House, its grounds and auxiliary residences were built by convict labour ‚Äì John Frederick Adolphus McNair, supervisor for the construction of Government House, was conveniently superintendent of convicts. It was an impressive building and won accolades from its occupants, writers and visitors. A swan lake on the grounds of the Istana A \\"nearly perfect\\" residence is how Sir Frederick Weld, Governor of the Straits Settlements and official resident there from 1880 to 1887, described it in a lecture at the Royal Colonial Institute in London. He said Government House was: =World War II= When Japan invaded in 1942, deliberate shelling destroyed the small ceremonial guns on the steps of Government House and left the building and its grounds in a state of ruin. The Governor, Sir Shenton Thomas, and Daisy, Lady Thomas loyally remained in Government House with their servants until the very last moments. When they finally evacuated, they took with them the Union Flag that had been flying in front of Government House and carefully kept it hidden throughout the Japanese Occupation. During the occupation, the house was occupied by Field Marshal Count Hisaichi Terauchi, commander of the Japanese Southern Army, and Major General Kawamura, commander of the Singapore Defence Forces. =Post-war= The building continued to be used by governors of the newly created Crown Colony of Singapore. When Singapore attained self-rule in 1959, the building was handed over to the Government of Singapore. It was then renamed the Istana. Yusof Ishak was appointed the first local head of state, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, and took up office at the Istana. The building was extensively renovated between 1996 and 1998 to add more space and modern-day conveniences. The building today has six function rooms used for ceremonial and entertainment purposes. The offices of the President of Singapore and her staff are in the building. =Present= Since its first occupancy in 1869, the Istana has seen 21 terms of governorship (1869‚Äì1958), two terms of occupation by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara (1959‚Äì1965) and six terms of presidential occupation (since 1965), not to mention the Japanese occupancy between 1942 and 1945. Today, the Istana is the official residence of the President of Singapore. However, no presidents nor cabinet ministers have lived there after the tenure of Devan Nair, the third President of Singapore. The villas, which are meant to be used for foreign heads of state, are used rarely. The Istana building and its grounds are open to the public on five selected statutory holidays ‚Äì Chinese New Year, Deepavali, Hari Raya Puasa, Labour Day and National Day. Due to the closeness of Deepavali and Hari Raya Puasa in some years, the grounds of the Istana are sometimes open only once during this period in commemoration of both public holidays. The grounds are also often used for state functions and ceremonial occasions such as swearings-in, investitures and the presentation of credentials by heads of foreign missions. The Prime Minister, Senior Minister and Minister Mentor have their offices in the Istana Annex. The current president, Halimah Yacob, initially indicated her desire to continue residing in her HDB flat in Yishun Avenue 4. She later moved into the Istana due to the government's recommendation for security reasons. The move took 2 months. On the first Sunday of the month, there is a Changing of the Guards parade, which is a popular public event. Architecture The Istana Villa. The Japanese field- artillery gun on display on the Istana grounds. The Istana is similar to many 18th-century neo-Palladian style buildings designed by British military engineers in India. It has a tropical layout like a Malay house, surrounded by statuesque columns, deep verandahs, louvred windows and panelled doors to promote cross-ventilation. The central three-storey 28-metre-high tower block dominates the building. The reasonably well-proportioned two-storey side wings feature Ionic, Doric and Corinthian orders with Ionic colonnades at the second storey and Doric colonnades at the first storey. The building sits in its elevated position overlooking its stately grounds, the Domain, reminiscent of the great gardens of England. =Buildings and structures in the grounds=Sri Temasek, also built in 1869 for the Colonial Secretary of the Straits Settlements, is the official residence of the Prime Minister. *The Annexe. *The Istana Villa (1938). *The Lodge (1974). *The Japanese field-artillery gun (a Type 92 10 cm cannon), presented to the leader of the returning victorious British forces to Singapore, Lord Louis Mountbatten, following the official Japanese surrender to the British in 1945 at the end of WWII. *Marsh Garden (1970). *Victoria Pond. *A nine-hole golf course. *A burial place of Bencoolen Muslims who came to Singapore between 1825 and 1828 is located on the southern slopes of the grounds close to the Orchard Road entrance. Rooms in the main building =First floor=The Reception Hall is where the president introduces the Cabinet of Singapore to visiting dignitaries and foreign heads of state. As its name states, tea receptions are held here after a state dinner. *In the Banquet Hall, guests dine with the President and are entertained. At the end of the hall is a trompe-l'≈ìil painted with a backdrop of orchids. The room, formerly part of the kitchen and some workshops, is also used to display state gifts. *The State Room is the seat and office of the President of Singapore. The hall is used for events such as the swearing-in of a newly elected Cabinet or President, or for presentations of awards. When it was the sitting room of Sir Shenton Thomas, he had a statue of Queen Victoria at one end of the room. The statue was later removed to make way for what is now the Presidential Chair and two state flags: the National Flag and the Presidential Standard. The statue of Queen Victoria now stands at the end of the Victoria Pond located south of the Istana Grounds. =Second floor=The Reception Room is a small parlour on the second floor leading to the East and West Sitting Rooms. It is where the President holds discussions with foreign dignitaries. *The East Sitting Room features a collection of state gifts, including a set of chinaware made in France and presented to President Benjamin Henry Sheares which is displayed in a bulletproof glass case. *The West Sitting Room is a parlour that has been the setting for many interviews with heads of state and Members of Parliament. The room is laid with original timber flooring from the 1930s. Displayed on the walls of the room are priceless replicas of Arab tapestry presented by the Sultan of Oman to President Ong Teng Cheong in the 1990s. *The Sheares Room is a private dining hall named after Dr. Benjamin Sheares, the second President of Singapore. It is used by the President and his/her family or, in some cases, the Cabinet. Name cards indicating the sitting positions of each person are printed and gold-plated by Risis. Besides the unique boat-shaped dining table in the room, seven painted panels depicting the seven presidents and their respective Cabinet members hang on the right of the room. *The Yusof Room is named for the first President of Singapore, Yusof bin Ishak; his bust sits at the end of this parlour. The room features a large Chinese-style panel painted with phoenixes and peonies. =Mezzanine floor= The U-shaped Grand Staircase leads to the second and third floors of the Istana. On the first landing stands the Guardian of the House on a raised display cabinet. The statue is made of wood from India, ivory and mother of pearl. The Guardian was made by Indian labourers who constructed the Istana and was presented to Sir Shenton Thomas to commemorate his taking up of residence there. During the Second World War, the statue was placed in a storeroom. It was forgotten until 1995 when Istana guards were tasked to clear the storeroom, at which time it was found lying next to the British coat of arms which used to hang at the main entrance to the Istana. =Third floor=Despite the name of the President's Lounge, it also serves as the main balcony of the Istana which overlooks the ceremonial square and lawn on the ground floor. The room is styled like the White House's Blue Room, which also overlooks the White House lawn. Facing this lounge is the office of the President. *The Office of the President of Singapore, which is out of bounds to the public, has four main pieces of furniture: a maroon sofa for guests to rest on, the main office desk made out of wood, a cowhide office chair, and a wooden side desk.

King‚Äôs College, London The NUS's founding constitutionArticles of Association and Rules stipulated that it must operate as a non-political and non-religious student organisation as the factional differences among nations were felt to have led to the recent world conflict. The non-political stipulation was dropped in 1969.The constitution was amended after the presidential election of Jack Straw (later UK Foreign Secretary) who had campaigned for the non-political clause's elimination in order to oppose the Vietnam War. From its outset the NUS founders were also noteworthy in ensuring that women were involved at its highest levels through a constitutional requirement.\\"At least three women must be on both the Council and the Executive\\" Memorandum on the Work and History of the National Union of Students, September 1928, page 9, Ivison Macadam Archives, Runton.

The CIE inaugural conference was held in Prague in 1921.The debate there was dominated by whether German students should be allowed to participate in the new international organisation. The French delegates and number of other countries felt that since the Germans had been enemy combatants and invaders of their lands in the recent war that they should not be permitted to participate. Macadam and the British delegation felt that the stated aims of the CIE required their participation. This was ultimately agreed. He chaired until 1929 the CIE's commission responsible for International Relations and Travel. In 1922 and again in 1923 Macadam led a successful tour of British students to Germany only four years after their nations had been at war to foster the importance of former combatants not remaining antagonists, when as he stated the \\"national animosities in Europe still kept most people within their own frontiers.\\" Memorandum on the Work and History of the National Union of Students, September 1928. page 25, Ivison Macadam Archives, Runton.

Hawker had written The Times to encourage the foundation of an international student organisation. Macadam had responded to the newspaper that such a body had already been formed. Hawker phoned the porter's lodge at Christ's College, Cambridge, asked to speak to Macadam and suggested they meet, where he asked in what tangible way he could help this new initiative? Macadam's response was by helping purchase a headquarters for the NUS. Bertram Hawker then donated the entire funds to acquire the freehold of two adjoining buildings at 3 Endsleigh Street, London, W.C.1. Ivison Macadam Archives, Runton.

It is now run under the umbrella of The Prince's Trust under the Chairmanship of the Prince of Wales. Macadam was responsible for devising the concept of, creating, editing and organising the printing and distribution of the official royal programs to be published under the auspices of the King George‚Äôs Jubilee Trust.

Philip Mountbatten, RN, 1947; The Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, 1953; the wedding of the Princess Margaret and Anthony Armstrong-Jones,1960 and the wedding of the Princess Alexandra of Kent and Angus Ogilvy, 1963. They were sold on behalf of King George‚Äôs Jubilee Trust mainly along the parade routes on the day of the event by the Boy Scouts but also prior to it in newsagents and bookshops. The substantial additional funds thus raised helped support the work of King George's Jubilee Trust in aiding young people, youth organisations and youth projects.

He played in Japan and represented the Japanese international side. He is a former New South Wales State of Origin and Australian international utility player, Wing played for the South Sydney Rabbitohs and the Sydney Roosters. Background Wing was born in Sydney, Australia. He is of Filipino descent through his mother. Early years He attended Sydney Boys High School where he played rugby union. In 1997 Wing was selected to play in the New South Wales Schoolboys 1st XV where the team remained undefeated until the final decider. Rugby league career =South Sydney= Wing made his first grade debut for South Sydney against the Auckland Warriors in round 1 1998 at Mt Smart Stadium. In round 10 of the 1999 NRL season, Wing announced himself as a talent of the future when he scored a solo try against Cronulla-Sutherland where he beat five Cronulla players to cross over the line. Wing scored two tries for South Sydney in what was to be their final ever game when they played against Parramatta in round 26 1999 at Parramatta Stadium. Following the conclusion of the 1999 NRL season, Souths were controversially excluded from the competition as part of the NRL's rationalisation policy. After Souths were excluded, he joined the club's arch rivals the Sydney Roosters. =Sydney Roosters= Wing played most of his professional rugby league at the Sydney Roosters. He moved to the club in 2000 and originally started as a halfback partnering Brad Fittler. Wing played from the interchange bench in the Sydney Roosters' 2000 NRL Grand Final loss to the Brisbane Broncos. He played at halfback in the Roosters team which won the 2002 NRL Grand Final against the New Zealand Warriors, scoring a try. Having won the 2002 NRL Premiership, the Roosters travelled to England to play the 2003 World Club Challenge against Super League champions, St Helens R.F.C.. Wing played at half back in the Roosters victory. Wing was later moved to in 2003 when halfback Brett Finch joined the club.ABC Sport ‚Äì Rugby League ‚Äì Hodges on the wing for Broncos After his side's loss in the 2003 NRL grand final, Wing was selected to go on the 2003 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France, helping Australia to victory over Great Britain in what would be the last time the two nations contested an Ashes series. Wing played for the Roosters at in their 2004 NRL grand final loss to cross-Sydney rivals, the Bulldogs. Wing was selected in the Australian team to go and compete in the end of season 2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against Great Britain he played from the interchange bench in the Kangaroos' 44‚Äì4 victory. Wing played in four NRL Grand Finals, a feat achieved by very few players in the NRL, and all with the Roosters: 2000, 2002, 2003 and 2004. =Return to Souths= Wing announced in June 2007 that he would be leaving the Roosters at the end of the 2007 NRL season to take up a four-year contract with the South Sydney Rabbitohs, the club where he started his career. While the Roosters' offer was higher, Wing said he felt more comfortable accepting the Souths offer as it was a guaranteed four-year deal compared to the Roosters' 2-year deal with an option for a further 2 years. Wing came under criticism for allowing himself to be paraded at a high-profile Souths press conference while still contracted at the Sydney Roosters. It could be argued that the Roosters started the whole problem in the first place however, as they broke the news of Craig Wing's signing on their website before Souths had officially signed him, in an apparent attempt to steal Souths thunder. In any case, Wing still apologised to the Roosters fans. He was jeered on 23 June 2007, by the Roosters fans at a game against the Parramatta Eels, his first game after signing for Souths.Wing jeered as Roosters thrashed ‚Äì League ‚Äì Fox Sports In round 1 of the season, Wing was injured in a tackle in only the 8th minute of the game against his old club the Roosters. Wing was in the process of being tackled by Anthony Tupou and Braith Anasta, when Riley Brown shoulder charged Wing's back. Wing was sidelined for 12 weeks. In a much awaited return, Wing helped Souths to only their fourth win of the season in his return from injury, beating bottom placed North Queensland Cowboys 29‚Äì28 in the greatest comeback in Souths' history, having been down 28‚Äì4 at one stage of the game. =Representative career= Wing represented the New South Wales State of Origin team, City Origin and the Australian Kangaroos. He was named in the Australia training squad for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup. He was selected for City in the City vs Country match on 8 May 2009. In May 2009, he was named in the 17-man squad to represent New South Wales in the opening game of the 2009 State of Origin series on 3 June 2009, in Melbourne. Rugby union career Wing announced on 21 July 2009 that he would be leaving South Sydney to play rugby union in Japan for the NTT Communications Shining Arcs and in 2010, he joined his former NSW Schoolboys 1st XV coach Joe Barakat who was coaching with the team. In 2012, after two seasons with Shining Arcs, he moved to the Kobelco Steelers, where he is listed as playing centre or stand-off. His switch to rugby union attracted interest from the Philippines national rugby union team who approached him to play for them, as he qualified through his mother who is Filipina. Despite this interest, in 2013 he was instead selected for the Japan Cherry Blossoms, having qualified after three years' residency. He made his debut for Japan in May 2013 in a match against the UAE. He scored his first try for Japan in June 2013, in a historic 23‚Äì8 win over , playing at centre in a side coached by fellow Australian Eddie Jones.

It was designed starting in 1963, and in operation from 1964 to 1973. History In 1961, the University of Cambridge found itself unable to fund a suitably powerful computer for its needs at the time, so the University purchased from Ferranti the main Atlas processing units and then jointly designed the memory and peripheral equipment. The joint effort led to a cheaper and simpler version of the Atlas that Ferranti could market, leaving Cambridge with the prototype version, named Titan. The Atlas hardware arrived in Cambridge in 1963, although software design was already underway. David Wheeler was in charge of the joint effort between the University and Ferranti. In 1965 the Cambridge side of the team decided to add a time-sharing facility for Titan, necessitating the acquisition of additional hardware. When Titan came into full service in 1966, time sharing was available for all staff. Titan was finally switched off in October 1973. Ferranti, by then a division of International Computers and Tabulators (ICT), marketed the Titan as the Atlas 2. Although intended to be more affordable than the Atlas, its price was still over ¬£1 million. A second Atlas 2 was built in Manchester, and was installed at the Computer-Aided Design Centre (CADCentre) on Madingley Road together with the Cambridge Titan supervisor. This machine, the last Atlas, was finally switched off on 21 December 1976. A third Atlas 2 was ordered by the UK's Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE) at Aldermaston. It replaced the faster and much more expensive IBM 7030 Stretch which had been leased from IBM. Hardware Titan differed from the original Manchester Atlas by having a real, but cached, main memory, rather than the paged (or virtual) memory used in the Manchester machine. It initially had 28K of memory, but this was expanded first to 64K and later to 128K. The Titan's main memory had 128K of 48-bit words and was implemented using ferrite core store rather than the part core, part rotating drum-store used on the Manchester Atlas. Titan also had two large hard-disk drives and several magnetic tape decks. As with the Manchester Atlas, it used discrete components, in particular germanium transistors. Some of these components can be seen in the online relics collection of the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. Uses Titan was the computer on which a team from Ferranti based in Bracknell working with David Barron, David Hartley, Roger Needham and Barry Landy of Cambridge University Maths Lab developed the early multi-user time- sharing operating system called Titan Supervisor. This was arguably the world's first commercially sold time-sharing operating system. Other experiments in time-sharing, such as CTSS and PLATO in the US, were one-of-a- kind research projects. One of Titan's most intensive uses was to compute the inverse Fourier Transforms of data from the One-Mile Radio Telescope.

He was a Reuters correspondent in Washington in the 1930s and a war correspondent during World War II in North Africa, Burma and Moscow. Early life Alaric Jacob was the son of Ellen Hoyer, the daughter of a Danish missionary, and Lieutenant-Colonel Harold Fenton Jacob, a member of the Indian Army and former political agent in Aden. Jacob was born in Edinburgh and brought up in Scotland. As a child, he spent time in India and Arabia, but was educated in England. He was childhood friends with Soviet spy Kim Philby. Jacob developed a stammer, which he believed came from his association with Philby. This was managed over time by singing lessons.Alaric Jacob Sharing Orwell's Joys ‚Äì but not his fears in Christopher Norris Inside the Myth Lawrence and Wishart 1984 Like several other promising children from Anglo- Indian or military families, Jacob attended St Cyprian's School for reduced fees. English novelist George Orwell left the school the year before Jacob started, and was presented as an inspiration to the students. Jacob's first term at St Cyprian's overlapped with English writer and literary critic Cyril Connolly's last year there. Connolly gave a lesson in Jacob's last year.Cyril Connolly Enemies of Promise 1938St Cyprian's Chronicle 1917, 1922 For Jacob it was \\"...an age of friendships, of excitement on the cricket fields and in school plays, of singing to a receptive audience at concerts, of having a sonnet printed in the school magazine, of winning the Townsend Warner History Prize.\\" Jacob struggled with the classics and did not enter for a scholarship to public school. He instead studied at The King's School, Canterbury; however, unimpressed with what he was learning, he left school and moved to France to pursue a career in journalism. Career =Writing and journalism= While in France, Jacob began writing, returning to England after the General Strike. When he was seventeen, his first play was produced in Plymouth, where he started his career as a journalist on the Western Morning News. His second play, The Compleat Cynic, was produced in Plymouth the following year. In 1930, at age 21, he published his first novel Seventeen, a fictionalized account of his school days in Canterbury. By then he had become a close friend of Margot Asquith, forty years his senior, who became his mentor and literary influence. She introduced him to editors and important literary figures, including Sir Roderick Jones, the head of Reuters, and was offered a position as diplomatic correspondent for Reuters in London. During his time in London, Jacob moved in high social and intellectual circles. He wrote a play in which the hero was a communist and as a result, decided to read Das Kapital. In 1934, he married Iris Morley, daughter of Lieutenant Colonel Chartres Morley. She was a historical novelist and journalist for The Observer and the Yorkshire Post. Early in their marriage, they bonded amidst the Great Depression and hunger marches. This period stirred up socialist sentiments in the couple. In 1936 the Jacobs went to Washington where he was in regular and close contact with US President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They stayed in Washington until the outbreak of World War II, when they returned to London. =War correspondent= Jacob remained in London until May 1941 when became a war correspondent for the Daily Express. He sailed to Cairo, taking the long sea route via Cape Town. He spent the next two years with the 8th Army in North Africa, initially covering the Siege of Tobruk and Operation Crusader. He was withdrawn from Tobruk shortly before it fell to the Germans and was posted to Tehran where he received permission from the Soviet Embassy to visit the Red Army in Azerbaijan. He returned to Egypt for the first and second Battle of El Alamein, before traveling to India. He covered Wingate's first 'Chindit' expedition in Burma, and the circumstances of Gandhi's fast. In the Soviet Union for four months, he covered the Battle of Kursk and Stalin's counterattack. He described his experiences in A Traveler's War published in 1944.Alaric Jacob A Traveller's War, Collins 1944 After Christmas leave in England in 1943, Jacob and Iris sailed to the Soviet Union in January 1944 on board a ship of the Arctic Convoy. They spent the remainder of the war in Moscow, covering the advances of the Red Army in Odessa, the Crimea, and through Vitebsk, Minsk, Poland, and on to the fall of Berlin. He published A Window in Moscow in 1945.Alaric Jacob A Window in Moscow, Collins, 1946 His experiences made him sympathetic towards the Soviet regime and he stayed in the Soviet Union, on and off, until the start of the cold war in late 1947. Iris had become a Communist and her ideas strongly influenced him. He suspected that her membership of the Communist Party worked against him even when they were separated.Mark Hollingsworth and Richard Norton-Taylor Blacklist:The Inside Story of Political Vetting, London: The Hogarth Press, 1988 ] In 1949, Jacob published Scenes from a Bourgeois Life, a semi- autobiographical novel and an apologia for the paradoxes and anomalies of his career. As an English traditionalist, he disapproved of \\"ribbon development\\" and the displacement of the old order by the nouveaux riches. His writing showed contempt for the pursuit of wealth through industrial capitalism and his appreciation for the Soviet Union's achievements. His work detailed his amorous adventures and his marked contempt for Cyril Connolly, who wallowed in self-pity in The Unquiet Grave, and for other \\"stay-at-home intellectuals with comfortable jobs in the BBC\\", while Soviet heroes fought the Battle of Stalingrad. =BBC= In August 1948, Jacob joined the BBC monitoring service in Caversham, Reading, but on February 1951 he was \\"suddenly refused establishment rights, which meant he would receive no pension\\". He complained unsuccessfully to his cousin Sir Ian Jacob, who was prominent in the BBC and later became the organization's Director-General. Some have attributed Jacob's problems to the fact that his name was on Orwell's list, a list of people with pro-communist leanings, prepared in March 1949 by Orwell for his friend Celia Kirwan at the Information Research Department, a propaganda unit set up at the Foreign Office by the Labor government.John Ezard Blair's babe Did love turn Orwell into a government stooge?

Personal life After Iris died in 1953, Jacob married British actress Kathleen Byron. He had one daughter with Iris, and a son and daughter with Kathleen. Journalist Paul Hogarth described Jacob in his obituary as the quintessential English journalist; urbane yet modest, with a bone-dry sense of humor and a razor intelligence. \\"He possessed the grand manner of an Edwardian foreign correspondent with an Alan-Clark-like taste for vintage claret, a good cigar and fine brandy\\".Richard Jones and Paul Hogarth Obituary: Alaric Jacob, The Independent (London), 8 February 1995 Jacob died in Lambeth, London,Deaths England and Wales 1984‚Äì2006 aged 85 on 26 January 1995.

They have been called \\"the Black Sabbath of Asia.\\" The group incorporates influences from traditional Taiwanese music, including adaptations of folk songs and the use of traditional instruments, most notably the erhu (often called the hi√¢n-√° [] in the band's native Taiwanese Hokkien). Their stated goal is to use their music to bring ancient history and mythology into the modern era especially to build awareness of the myths of Taiwan and tragic events in that country's history (for example, those experienced by the Seediq people). Since 2011 their trademark erhu has been complemented with stringed instruments including the koto and shamisen, as well as Tibetan Bells and shakuhachi and pgaki flutes, the latter of which are traditionally used by the aboriginal people of Taiwan. The band members are also acclaimed artists and political activists who advocate independence for Taiwan and self-determination for Tibetans and Uighurs. Singer Freddy Lim served as Chairman of the Taiwan chapter of Amnesty International from 2010 to 2014 and has been a legislator since 2016, first representing the New Power Party before becoming an independent. Since their formation, Chthonic has released eight studio albums. Their most recent full-length record, Battlefields of Asura, was released in October 2018. History Freddy Lim started the band in 1995. He was the Chairman of Amnesty International Taiwan from 2010 to 2014 and is now an elected representative in the Legislative Yuan. \\"Broken Jade\\" from Takasago Army (2011). =Formation (1995‚Äì1998)= Chthonic was formed in 1995, and the band name \\"Chthonic\\" is a Greek term referring to the earth and the underworld. In the west, the term is usually pronounced thonic. The original members were Freddy Lim and some of his classmates from high school and university. The line-up went through many changes before the band released their debut album in 1998. By that point the line-up had settled around Freddy Lim on vocals and erhu, Zac Chang on guitar, Xiao-Yu on bass, Xiao-Wang on drums, and Ambrosia on keyboards and backing vocals. Chthonic became quite popular in the rock scene in Taiwan. They played to a full house at Vibe, the main rock club in Taipei at the time, and played as headliners for large rock festivals like Spring Scream. They released their first single \\"Ê∑±ËÄï\\" (\\"Deep Plowing\\") in early 1998. In their early years, Chthonic tried different styles of heavy metal. Lim sang clean vocals in \\"Êµ∑ÊÅØ\\" (\\"The Breath of Ocean\\"); the early song \\"Ê∑±ËÄï\\" (\\"Cultivating\\") can be classified as power metal while \\"ÊØçÂ≥∂Ëß£È´îÁôªÂü∫\\" (\\"Decomposition of the Mother Isle (Aboriginal Gods Enthroned)\\") is black metal. Keyboardist Ambrosia occasionally sang in the early songs as well. From the start, Lim has written songs in Taiwanese, Classical Chinese, and Mandarin Chinese; more recent albums have been released in English versions as well. =Success in Asia (1998‚Äì2002)= Chthonic's debut album, Where the Ancestors' Souls Gathered (Á•ñÈùà‰πãÊµÅ), was released in late 1998. The band released the album independently and it reached No. 2 on the Tower Records pop music chart for Asia. In 1999 Zac, Xiao-Yu, and Xiao-Wang left the band and were replaced by Jesse Liu, Doris Yeh, and AJ Tsai respectively. The band recorded their second album 9th Empyrean (ÈùàÈ≠Ñ‰πãÁïå), which was released in Taiwan by Crystal Records in 2000. It reached No. 1 on the Tower Records pop music chart for Asia and was also considered one of the best ten Mandarin albums of that year by Hong Kong's MCB magazine. This album's music style is closer to symphonic black metal, with Lim adopting harsh vocals mixed with keyboardist Ambrosia's female singing. The song \\"Ê∞∏Âõ∫ÈÇ¶Á®∑\\" (\\"Guard the Isle Eternally\\") was the first Chthonic song to mix Asian pentatonic scale melodies with black metal. In 2000, Chthonic appeared at the Fuji Rock Festival, one of the biggest rock festivals in Japan, and embarked on their first international tour through Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore. In Hong Kong, they signed with Catalyst Action Records, and in Japan, Soundholic was their distributor. In 2001, keyboardist Ambrosia left the band and was replaced by Vivien Chen. Chthonic then recorded their third album, Relentless Recurrence, which was based on the legendary Taiwanese ghost story \\"Lin-tou Jie.\\" The album was recorded in Denmark and released in Taiwan by Crystal Records in 2002. The album retains the symphonic black metal style mixed with Taiwanese elements. Relentless Recurrence was also the first Chthonic album written entirely in Taiwanese. In 2002 the band completed their second international tour, and played at the old stadium of National Taiwan University with traditional Taiwanese lion drums and a traditional Taiwanese orchestra. =Success in Europe and the United States (2002‚Äì08)= In 2002 Chthonic signed with Nightfall Records in the United States and released an English version of 9th Empyrean in North America. All subsequent Chthonic albums have been released internationally in English versions. In 2002 the band played festivals in the United States, Japan, and Hong Kong; and toured with Swedish black metal band Dark Funeral. In late 2002 keyboardist Vivien Chen left the band and was replaced by Luis Wei. In 2003 the band released the single \\"Satan's Horns,\\" which was used as the theme song for the Taiwanese release of the movie Freddy vs. Jason. In 2003 they won the Best Band Award at the Taiwan Golden Melodies Award Ceremony. In 2004 Alexia Lee replaced Luis Wei on keyboards and Dani Wang replaced AJ Tsai on drums. In 2005 the band released their fourth album, Seediq Bale, which is based on the Wushe Incident. In addition to symphonic black metal mixed with Taiwanese elements, Seediq Bale featured increased use of erhu, blast beats, and female vocals (including a guest appearance by pop singer Sandee Chan). The album was released in Mandarin Chinese and English versions, with both integrating some Seediq and Japanese lyrics. This album also supported donations for the movie project Seediq Bale directed by Wei Te-sheng, who in turn donated the film's trailer for Chthonic's use in the music video for \\"Quasi Putrefaction.\\" After the release of Seediq Bale keyboardist Alexia Lee left and was replaced by CJ Kao; the erhu player Su-nong also joined the band. In early 2006, Chthonic held the \\"A Decade on the Throne\\" concert in Huashan Culture Park, Taipei. To celebrate their tenth anniversary the band released a DVD of that concert, the compilation album Pandemonium, and the book CHTHONIC Dynasty (ÈñÉÈùàÁéãÊúù) via Eurasian Books. Seediq Bale (English version) was released in 2006 and 2007 in many countries; in Japan it was released by Howling Bull, in North America by Megaforce Records, and in Europe by SPV Records; the album was also released in several South American and Asian countries. Revolver cited Chthonic as \\"The Band to Watch\\" and England's Alternative Vision awarded them \\"Band of the Month.\\" In 2007 Chthonic were featured as a second stage act at the 2007 Ozzfest tour. The band named that year's tour \\"UNlimited Taiwan Tour\\" to draw awareness to the fact that the United Nations does not recognize Taiwan. This symbolic protest was covered by the US mainstream media, including ABC television, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, and others. That year they also toured with Nile, D√•√•th, Obituary, Cradle of Filth, Marduk, Ensiferum, and 3 Inches of Blood while playing in several European countries. A book titled GUTS!, featuring a diary of the UNlimited Taiwan Tour, was released in Europe and Asia. =International recognition (2008‚Äì2013)= Chthonic released the album Mirror of Retribution in 2009 on Spinefarm Records, produced by Anthrax guitarist Rob Caggiano. Mirror of Retribution is based on the February 28 Incident and features guest appearances by singers Sandee Chan and Francine Boucher of the band Echoes of Eternity. The album was released in Taiwanese and English versions. The British music magazine Kerrang! called the album \\"Top-notch\\" metal, and Freddy Lim appeared on the cover of Terrorizer magazine. Doris Yeh joined Chthonic as bassist in 1999 and appeared on the cover of FHM Magazine Taiwan in November 2008 and June 2012. During this period, bassist Doris Yeh became the band's spokesperson and business manager, taking over the roles performed by Freddy Lim since the band's formation in 1995. Yeh has since earned a great amount of publicity, speaking about the band's political beliefs in magazines like Monocle in the United Kingdom, Metropolis in Japan, and Cacao in Taiwan. Yeh has also been recognized as a model and sex symbol, appearing on the cover of the Taiwanese version of Body magazine and regularly being selected as one of the sexiest women in music by Revolver and the Taiwanese version of FHM. Chthonic was named \\"Best International Artist\\" in 2009 at the Tibetan Music Awards.Phurbu Thinley, Organiser clueless about low turnout at Tibetan Music Awards 2009 , Phayul.com, 11 October 2009 Erhu player Su-nong left the band in 2009, with Lim taking over that instrument. After many early changes, the lineup of Freddy Lim, Doris Yeh, Jesse Liu, Dani Wang, and CJ Kao has remained intact since 2009. In the 2009 Terrorizer readers' polls the band was voted No. 2 for best band, No. 2 for best album, and No. 2 for best performance; Freddy Lim was voted No. 3 for best singer, Doris Yeh was voted No. 2 for best bass player; Jesse Liu was voted No. 7 for best guitarist, and Dani Wang was voted No. 8 for best drummer. Yeh and Lim were also No. 9 and No. 10 respectively as best individual performer, making Chthonic the only band to have two members in the top 10 for that category. In 2009 and 2010 Chthonic continued to tour internationally, including stints with Satyricon, Bleeding Through, and Arch Enemy, plus appearances at several major heavy metal festivals in Asia and Europe. In 2010 the band released the digital single \\"Painkiller,\\" a Judas Priest cover. Their sixth album Takasago Army was released on Spinefarm Records in 2011. This album is based on the story of the Takasago Volunteers, Taiwanese aboriginal soldiers who fought for Japan during World War II. The album included guest appearances from singers Yu Tien and Chan Yawen, and Taroko musician Pitero Wukah on pgaku flute. Main songwriters Freddy Lim and Jesse Liu stated that Takasago Army marked a reversal in the band's writing, as the songs were first written in a traditional Taiwanese folk format but were then played with heavy metal techniques. Doris Yeh stated that the Western definition of \\"heavy metal,\\" whether it is black metal or death metal, cannot easily define Chthonic's style; thus, having to choose a term, the band uses the term \\"Orient Metal.\\" Takasago Army reached No. 109 on Japan's Oricon music chart, and the video for the song \\"Takao\\" was nominated for the 2012 Golden Melody Award in Taiwan for best music video. The album was featured in the international metal magazines Revolver, Terrorizer, and Metal Hammer, and was named the year's best melodic black metal album by the critics' webzine Metal Storm. Furthermore, Boulevard Brutal, a French music critics' site, selected Takasago Army as the best black metal album of the year; and the Japanese rock magazine Burrn!! awarded the band a No. 7 rank for best album of the year and No. 23 for best heavy metal band. After more international touring in North America, Europe, and Asia, including stints with Arch Enemy, Devil Driver, and Skeletonwitch, in October 2011 Chthonic organized a concert at Taiwan's remote Sing Ling Temple, a historical landmark mentioned in their last three albums. This concert featured a guest appearance by singer Randy Blythe of Lamb of God, while selected fans from outside of Taiwan were given free plane tickets to travel to the concert. The competition for tickets was covered widely in Taiwanese media. In early 2012 Chthonic released a DVD of the Sing Ling Temple concert and also made some acoustic appearances at Eslite bookstores in Taiwan. In 2012 Chthonic supported Lamb of God in Asia, while ESP Guitars released customized models for bassist Doris Yeh and guitarist Jesse Liu. Chthonic continued to play major festivals in Europe and Asia, with former Megadeth guitarist Marty Friedman appearing with the band at Japan's Fuji Rock Festival. The band's seventh studio album, Bu- Tik, and was released in June 2013 worldwide through Spinefarm Records. The album cover for Bu-Tik depicts a nude female with white hair wielding a sword in her right hand and a prosthetic gun on her left arm. =Recent events (2014-present)= Timeless Sentence (Â§±Á´äÂçÉÂπ¥ ), a live album featuring acoustic rearrangements of songs from the two previous studio albums, was released in late 2014 by Spinefarm Records. In an interview, the band indicated that this will be their last acoustic album. Freddy Lim then expanded his political activities, founding the New Power Party in early 2015.New Power Party Platform(Chinese)Taiwan's newest politicians include a rock star and an aboriginal activist In January 2016, Lim was elected to Taiwan's Legislative Yuan representing Taipei City Constituency 5. He was then assigned to the Foreign and National Defense Committee and has formed a caucus to address issues in Tibet. In March 2017, Chthonic played at the Megaport Music Festival; bassist Doris Yeh was absent due to recently giving birth and Shingo‚òÜ of Sex Machineguns filled in. A new song titled \\"Souls of the Revolution,\\" featuring Randy Blythe, was released in December 2017. The song is featured in the band-produced film Tshiong, which was released in Taiwan on 29 December 2017. The film, in development since 2015 and also featuring Blythe, is an action-comedy starring the members of Chthonic as political activists trying to stop a development project in a small Taiwanese village. A soundtrack album featuring \\"Souls of the Revolution\\" and incidental score music was released in Asia. At the 2018 Megaport Music Festival, Chthonic performed another new song called \\"A Crimson Sky's Command\\". Chthonic's eighth and most recent album Battlefields of Asura was released on October 10, 2018. In December 2018, Chthonic was unable to perform with Cantopop singer Denise Ho in Hong Kong since their work visa application was rejected due to domestic security reasons. The band ultimately ended up performing the song \\"Millennia's Faith Undone\\" remotely via Facebook. Activism and lyrical themes Chthonic singer Freddy Lim is notably active in the Taiwanese political scene and supports that country's independence movement. He has been active in the Taiwan Association for Human Rights, Amnesty International (serving as President of that group's Taiwan chapter from 2010 to 2014), and other non-governmental human rights organizations. In 2003 and 2009, he promoted the Free Tibet Concert in Taiwan. In 2007 Lim and other artists organized an international music festival to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the February 28 Incident, entitled \\"Spirit of Taiwan: With Justice We Cure This Nation.\\" He is now a representative in the Legislative Yuan. In addition, bassist Doris Yeh has endorsed the Awakening Foundation, a women's rights organization in Taiwan. In February 2009, Lim and Yeh protested with human rights activists at the Taipei zoo panda exhibit, which symbolizes China's attempts to establish soft power relations with Taiwan. In August 2009, many aboriginal villages in Taiwan were heavily damaged by Typhoon Morakot, and Chthonic donated the proceeds from two concerts to an aboriginal organization. Lim personally carried supplies into the disaster areas. In March 2011, after the northeastern Japan earthquake, Chthonic raised and donated over one million NT$ for relief efforts. During Chthonic's 2011 North American tour, they received a threatening letter from unknown Chinese persons. The band is also banned in parts of China for their political views. The band's lyrics are often based on the defiant spirit of early Taiwanese colonizers, fictional wars between aboriginal gods and Han Chinese gods, Taiwanese folklore and mythology, historical events such as the Wushe Incident and the February 28 Incident, and the formation of the Takasago Volunteers. Prior to the album Seediq Bale most of the band's lyrics were written in Classical Chinese, which is rarely used in contemporary Chinese or Taiwanese music, and sung with Mandarin pronunciation. Starting with the album Mirror of Retribution the lyrics are written and sung in Taiwanese Hokkien. Some songs may also include verses in Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, or Formosan languages. Starting with Seediq Bale the band has released alternate versions of their albums for the international market, with some songs remixed with English lyrics. Stage performance Chthonic is also known for their unique stage costumes, which originally included corpse paint similar to that used by many Scandinavian black metal bands, from which Chthonic drew their early inspiration. Starting in 1998 Chthonic incorporated some Taiwanese elements and characteristics into their stage attire, such as the \\"8 Generals of Hell\\" glyphs on Freddy Lim's forehead. Keyboardist CJ Kao uses a cloth inscribed with Chinese characters wrapped around his head, which in mythology is a spell to raise Chinese Vampires from the dead. With the release of the album Takasago Army in 2011, Chthonic changed to costumes inspired by Asian military or martial arts attire. They stopped using corpse paint because the band members found it tedious to put on before concerts. Fans often toss hell money during Chthonic's stage performances to pay tribute to the lost souls described in the songs and to create a dark atmosphere. People of Chinese culture who are unfamiliar with Chthonic may find this offensive or disrespectful because the practice is considered to be taboo.

It consists of wetlands, fields, and forests. The refuge surrounds the former farm of Charles Hinckley and later Charles Albert Creamer (1889-1974), a former chicken rancher from Washington state who moved to Fairbanks. Creamer saved waste grains from his barn to feed migrating birds. After Creamer's death, preservationists banded together to make the area a state refuge. The Creamer farmstead now serves as a visitor center and environmental education center, with the non-profit \\"Friends of Creamer's Field\\" presenting programs year- round. In the summer visitors can take a guided nature walk on the refuge trails. The refuge is open 24 hours a day 7 days a week. It is a multi-use refuge, and limited hunting is also allowed in certain seasons. In winter dog mushing trails criss cross the back of the acreage, while skijorers have trails in the front fields. Among the birds that flock to the refuge in late summer during migration south are Sandhill Cranes, Many ducks and Canada geese.  History  Charles Hinckley built a log barn and opened a dairy business upon arriving in Fairbanks in 1904. In 1938 Charles Albert Creamer succeeded to Hinckley and built the modern day barn, which is still visible today. All other buildings in the area were constructed subsequently after, up to the closure of business in 1965. The State of Alaska purchased all the land around the dairy in 1969, to establish the Migratory Refuge. The property is the only group of pioneer dairy farm buildings surviving in the interior of Alaska. The Creamer's Dairy, also known as Hinckley's Dairy, comprising the barn and five other historical buildings, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

(), the women's department of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the All-Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), was the section of the Russian Communist party devoted to women's affairs in the 1920s. It gave Women in the Russian Revolution new opportunities until Stalin closed it in 1930. History The Zhenotdel was established by two Russian feminist revolutionaries, Alexandra Kollontai and Inessa Armand, in 1919. It was devoted to improving the conditions of women's lives throughout the Soviet Union, fighting illiteracy, and educating women about the new marriage, education, and working laws put in place by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In Soviet Central Asia, the Zhenotdel also spearheaded efforts to improve the lives of Muslim women through literacy and educational campaigns, and controversially, through compulsory \\"de- veiling\\" campaigns.Gregory J. Massell, The Surrogate Proletariat: Moslem Women and Revolutionary Strategies in Soviet Central Asia, 1919-1929, Princeton: Princeton University Press, [1978] 2015 The Zhenotdel persuaded the Bolsheviks to legalise abortion (as a 'temporary measure'). The Bolsheviks legalised aborting in November 1920. This was the first time in world history that women had won the right to free abortions in state hospitals. The leaders of the Zhenotdel were committed communists, and worked as part of the Soviet state apparatus. Historian Elizabeth Wood has argued that the organization took an active interest in women's problems, and initially served as a conduit for women's issues from the people to the state. The Zhenotdel was shut down in 1930, in accordance with the then-dominant theory among the members of the Zhenotdel that all women's issues in the Soviet Union had been \\"solved\\" by the eradication of private property and the nationalization of the means of production.Wendy Z.

The first GSX models were introduced in 1980 and represented the next step in Suzuki's four-stroke road bike range after the two-valve GS Series. In North America though, the Suzuki four-valve and two-valve four-stroke road bikes were both designated as Suzuki GS motorcycles. The two-valve engines remained in production in parallel with the four-valve power plants, the larger two-valve four-cylinder engines gaining shaft-drive and being used to power Suzuki's more touring-orientated bikes such as the GS 850G and GS 1100G, while the GSX series represented performance orientation.  GSX Development  The two-valve GS Series was Suzuki's first real foray into four-stroke motorcycles. Although Suzuki produced 90cc and 123cc four- stroke single cylinder road bikes under the brand Colleda in the mid-1950s, up until 1976 Suzuki was primarily a builder of two-stroke motorcycles. Suzuki's range of road going motorcycles was almost entirely two-stroke in the mid-1970s (the oddball being the Wankel Rotary powered RE-5). The sophisticated Suzuki GT series and the flagship 750cc water-cooled, posi-lube lubricated, three-cylinder two-stroke GT750 characterizing the breed. The GS750 introduced in 1976, along with the parallel-twin GS400, was Suzuki's first large multi-cylinder four-stroke motorcycle. The GS was Suzuki's version of what was and is referred to as a Universal Japanese Motorcycle, so common was this 4-cylinder four-stroke configuration amongst the Japanese manufacturers at the time. The 63 bhp air-cooled, twin-cam, in-line four cylinder, GS750 road bike set the pattern for the GS/GSX range until the birth of the first of the race-replicas, the 1985 air/oil-cooled Suzuki GSX-R750. The GS750 two-valve engine showed the influence of Suzuki's long history of two-stroke design and manufacture; the new four-strokes sporting pressed together roller bearing crank-shafts universally used in two-stroke bottom ends. GSX1100 16-Valve head (GS1100)GSX1100 (GS1100) TSCC DetailThe key feature of the GSX engine was the change from the common two-valve per cylinder hemispherical combustion chamber with domed piston design of the GS engine, to a four-valve per cylinder Twin Swirl Combustion Chamber (TSCC) with flat topped piston design. The TSCC design was essentially a modification of the Pent-roof combustion chamber design to which was added a slightly raised ridge running along the combustion chamber roof parallel to the gas flow of the inlet charge. This was to encourage controlled swirl of the incoming fuel- air charge in order to increase the fuel burn speed through better flame front propagation. The higher burn speed, coupled with lowered heat loss from the shallower combustion chambers created by comparatively narrow included valve angles and the flat topped piston meant that the GSX engines produced more power and torque than the same sized GS mills. The other major difference with the first GSX engines was the move from direct overhead cam actuation of the valve by shim and bucket of the GS engines, to valve actuation via short forked rocker arms in the GSX -the valves stems and springs being located inboard from the camshafts due to the reduced included angle between inlet and exhaust valves. Apart from the heads the GS/GSX engines were of a common design. The current range of bikes by that name are completely different designs that use derivatives of former super sports engines from the early-to- middle GSX-R series. Early GSX 1983 GSX250E with GSX400E side panels A 1982 GSX750 used by the New Zealand Ministry of Transport 1982 GS(X)750E all stock/original except aftermarket screen and parcel rack Among the earliest GSX models were the two-cylinder GSX 250 and the GSX 400. These Suzuki GSX models were the evolution of the GS series of two-valve-per-cylinder air and oil-cooled four-stroke motorcycles. The first four-valve engines were produced for the 1980 model year, but retained the \\"GS\\" designation for the US and Canadian markets until the release of the GSX-R models in 1986 (1985 outside the US). These GSX engines were based on Suzuki's \\"TSCC\\" (Twin-Swirl Combustion Chamber) engine design, and shared little with previous two-valve models. In 1999, only for the Asian market, the sport-touring Thunder GS 250 emerged. Subsequently, to be given the designation GSX in 2001. By 2005, that was then completely discontinued. The Suzuki Katana, which had the same \\"TSCC\\" engine design but, with the designation of GSX-S. Although, that had little in common with the more modern GSX-F Katanas which are, like the previously mentioned Thunder, sport-touring bikes. The TSCC engine was once again redesigned in 1983 with the introduction of a completely new GSX 750, Suzuki's first modern mono-shocked sportbike in both a naked (GSX 750E) and half-faired (GSX 750ES) version. Although this bike received solid reviews from testing magazines (and came to be the testers' preferred 750 sport machine for the year), its release was an ill-timed duel against Honda's all-new V4 engine in the form of the VF750 Interceptor. The 1983 GSX 750ES had air-adjustable anti- dive forks, preload and compression-adjustable rear mono-shock (\\"Full- Floater\\"), disc brakes at both ends, a fuel gauge and digital gear indicator. More significantly, the 83 GSX750 was Suzuki's first mass appeal motorcycle to sport a 16\\" front wheel in place of the previous models 19\\" wheel. The 16\\" wheel making its production debut on a Suzuki with the GS650 Turbo. The 16\\" front wheel was a development used in early to mid 1980s 500cc GP motorcycles at the time to quicken steering at high speeds by reducing the gyroscopic effect and shortening/widening the front tyre contact patch. On the road the 16\\" wheel proved unpopular and quickly fell out of favour due to its instability on bumpy road surfaces. In 1984 the U.S. market received the GS 700 - a bike with a de-stroked engine and minor cosmetic differences due to the imposition by the U.S. Government of a 50% tariff on all imported motorcycles displacing more than 700cc (repealed in 1988). All other markets continued to receive 750cc models. Modifications in 700cc guise included taller pistons and slightly differing cam lift and timing. This plus a change in factory gear ratios enabled Suzuki to produce a US-only motorcycle with near-identical performance specifications to the GSX 750ES, even though engine displacement was 15 per cent smaller. The 50 per cent tariff was the reason behind the glut of de-stroked 650 cc and 700 cc Japanese motorcycles sold in the US in the mid-1980s - unique to the U.S. - and is also the reason the GSX-R debuted in the U.S. a full year later than the rest of the world. It was available as the naked GS 700E and as the GS 700ES with bikini fairing. Outside the US market the GSX 750S Katana was completely restyled in 1984 sharing the same engine and 16\\" front wheel chassis of the ES. 1984 also saw the release of completely new GSX-R 750 signaled a new direction of race- replica sport bikes. The GSX range being relegated from the role of flag-ship models in the Suzuki range. 1984 also saw an update in color schemes for the GSX 750ES in the rest of the world, with the naked \\"E\\" being dropped in favor of the half-faired \\"ES\\" and a new \\"EF\\" model with full upper and lower sport fairings (never available as a factory option in the US). GSX1100F. The GSX 750E lived on for a few more years, but was eventually superseded by the sport-touring orientated GSX-F series, marketed in the US as Katanas. The original Hans Muth designed GSX-S Katanas were also dropped from Suzuki's global lineup by the mid-1980s, with sporting/racing duties better served by the lighter SACs (Suzuki Advanced Cooling System) air/oil-cooled GSX-Rs. The GSX 1100 lived on with significant styling changes for the 1984 model year with the addition of a 16\\" front end, including a full-faired 124 bhp monster of a musclebike, the GSX 1100EFE (US: GS1150EF). The larger bikes, although still sought-after as classic superbikes, were also replaced by the GSX-F (Katana in North America only) lineups, based on detuned GSX-R engines with significant body styling changes such as an electrically operated screen in the 1100F, upgraded suspension and braking components, and frame revisions. Current GSX The Suzuki GSX650F The GSX 750S (US: Katana) received an updated engine for 1984, along with Suzuki's other big-bore four-valver models. This is the engine that the first Suzuki GSX-R Series bikes were based on. Current GSX models are powered by derivatives of this in-line, four- cylinder engine with four valves per cylinder, which is also used in the Suzuki Bandit Series up to the end of the 2006 model year. They feature a combined air/oil cooling system called SACS (for 'Suzuki Advanced Cooling System'). The current GSX series is produced as the GSX600F and GSX750F faired sport touring models, now in their second generations, and the unfaired, twin- shock GSX 750 and GSX 1400 models. The bike was used to win the 2007 Endurance FIM World Championship. The GSX650F, produced from 2008, is essentially a variation on the Bandit 650, with much the same specification and components.Daily Telegraph review The additional lower fairing, however, gives it a sportier look similar to that of the Suzuki GSX-R Series (though the Bandit chassis means that it carries 110 lb extra weight compared with a GSX-R), the engine has had a small amount of remapping to encourage revs, and the suspension is tweaked. It also has a one-piece seat, unlike the Bandit. The earlier GSX750 and GSX1200 Inazuma (GSX750W and GSX1200W) were offered in Japan and Europe for a short time besides the GSF1200 Bandit to cater for a clientele that went for a more traditional styling and a somewhat higher build quality. When they proved sufficiently popular for overseas export, they were quickly developed into the current GSX 1400. These modern non-US GSX-models carry little in common with their early to mid-eighties cousins other than a distant ancestor in their powerplant. The GSX 1100S Katana has been reissued as an anniversary model several times for the Japanese domestic market (where the GSX 400S Katana remains a very popular model with styling straight from the early-1980s), and Yoshimura has recently released a small handful of fully re-worked factory GSX 1100S Katana models for sale, requiring potential buyers to win an essay contest before being granted the opportunity to purchase one of these bikes. The GSX 250F is known as the Suzuki Across and is notable as it has a rear petrol tank and a helmet storage area where the petrol tank usually is.

It was released in June 1992 for Atari ST, MS-DOS and Amiga. The player assumes the role of a young peasant named Diermot who has to overthrow an evil sorceress. Lure of the Temptress is the first game built with the Virtual Theatre engine, which Revolution used in the subsequent games Beneath a Steel Sky and the first two games in the Broken Sword series. It was received favourably by critics, a commercial success and re-released as freeware on April 1, 2003.  Gameplay  Lure of the Temptress is a 2D adventure game played from a third-person perspective. Via a point-and-click interface and a system of drop-down lists, the player guides protagonist Diermot through the game's world and interacts with the environment by selecting from multiple commands. The player controls Diermot's movements and actions with a mouse or a gamepad. Diermot can pick up various objects; these can then be used with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. He can also engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of what needs to be done to solve the puzzles or progress the plot. A few simple action-oriented battle scenes are also included.  Plot  Gameplay screenshot from the game's opening chapter of dungeon escape A young peasant named Diermot is employed as a beater for the king's hunting party. One night the king receives a note from a messenger, requesting his services to help quell a rebellion in the remote village of Turnvale. As the king's party departs, Diermot's pony follows them, unwittingly carrying him to the battle. When the party arrives at Turnvale they are not confronted by a peasant revolt. Instead they find a band of man- eating Skorl, led by an enchantress named Selena, the titular temptress. The king's men are defeated and the king is killed. In the process, Diermot is thrown from his saddle and is knocked unconscious. The Skorl take Diermot prisoner and imprison him in the local dungeon. With help from a peasant named Ratpouch, Diermot manages to escape from the dungeon and visits Luthern, the blacksmith. Luthern reveals that a girl named Goewin who runs a herb shop has recently disappeared. Diermot discovers that she had been arrested by the Skorl. With help from Ratpouch, Diermot breaks into the house of Taidgh, the magician, where he creates a potion which disguises him as Selena. He enters the mansion where Goewin is being held and orders the Skorl to free her. Not long after, a man named Mallin gives Diermot a book wrapped in cloth to take to a man named Morkus. In the process of delivering the book, Diermot sees a notice stating that whoever returns the book to its rightful owner will be rewarded. Diermot delivers the book to a man named Toby, who rewards him with a statuette. Toby reveals that the dragon can help Diermot defeat Selena, but that he will need an infusion made of three herbs to wake the dragon up, which Goewin then makes for Diermot. Diermot enters the dragon's cave and wakes him up. The dragon agrees to help Diermot, revealing that Turnvale was the domain of a demon long before humans came to the area. This demon should have died along with his breed long ago, but did not perish because it was able to feed on man's greed and ambition in order to survive. The demon was driven out by the great Gethryn, but the young sorceress Selena's meddling with evil has reawakened the demon, and it controls her mortal form. The dragon possesses the Eye of Gethryn, an enchanted stone left by Gethryn at the time of his death. The stone contains the power to defeat the demon, and the dragon then gives the stone to Diermot. A Skorl named Wayne, who turns against Selena, sneaks Diermot into Selena's castle in a barrel. Diermot defeats Selena with the Eye of Gethryn, freeing Turnvale from her tyranny.  Development and release  Charles Cecil and Tony Warriner had worked together at Artic Computing, an English video game development company. In 1990, they decided that they would set up their own video game development company, together with David Sykes and Noirin Carmody. The four started up Revolution Software, initially based in Hull, with a 10 thousand pounds loan from Cecil's mother. Cecil wanted the game to differ from popular Sierra games at the time, saying: \\"While I enjoyed Sierra games, I felt that there had to be more than yet again saving King Graham of Daventry from a ‚Äì let‚Äôs be frank ‚Äì fairly unlikely series of events. It was all a little bit twee. So we came up with the idea of writing an adventure game that did not take itself too seriously, but did have a serious story ‚Äì something in-between Lucasarts and Sierra.\\" The game was published by Virgin Interactive Entertainment. Lure of the Temptress was the first game built with the Virtual Theatre engine, which allowed in-game characters to wander around the gameworld independently of each other, performing \\"every day life\\" actions, which had not previously been featured in a game. It was later used for Beneath a Steel Sky and the first two games in the Broken Sword series. The title cost between 20 and 30 thousand pounds. On April 1, 2003, the game was released as freeware. The data files are available from the Revolution Software website for download and the game's engine has been added to ScummVM. This version of Lure of the Temptress was released on GOG.com on December 18, 2008.  Reception  Upon its release, Lure of the Temptress was received favorably by critics, who praised the game's innovative controls and graphics, and compared it to Sierra and LucasFilm games. In 1993, Dragon gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. Computer Gaming World liked the game's sophisticated NPC interactions and how it prevented unwinnable situations, but criticized its short playing time. The magazine concluded that \\"Lure of the Temptress is a fine first release from this developer and bodes well for the future\\". Amiga Power ranked it at #47 in 1993, and at #66 in 1994, on their list of Amiga Power All-Time Top 100.

The airport is located on the Dutch side of the island, in the country of Sint Maarten. In 2015, the airport handled 1,829,543 passengers and around 60,000 aircraft movements.sxmairport.com: Annual Report 2015, visited 2 March 2016 The airport serves as a hub for Windward Islands Airways and is the major gateway for the smaller Leeward Islands, including Anguilla, Saba, St. Barth√©lemy and St. Eustatius. It is named after Queen Juliana, who landed here while still only heir presumptive in 1944, the year after the airport opened. The airport has very low-altitude flyover landing approaches, owing to one end of its runway being extremely close to the shore and Maho Beach. There is also an airport on the French side of the island, in the French Collectivity of Saint Martin, called A√©roport de Grand Case or L'Esp√©rance Airport. History The airport began as a US military airstrip in 1942 during World War II. The following year, first commercial flight landed on 3 December 1943. The future Queen Juliana visited the island using the airport in 1944. Eventually, the airport was named after her. In 1964 the airport was remodeled and relocated, with a new terminal building and control tower. The facilities were upgraded in 1985 and 2001. Because of increased passenger traffic and the expected growth of passenger traffic in the near future, Princess Juliana International Airport is being heavily modernized following a three-phased masterplan, commissioned in 1997.Company website with PJIAE Masterplan Phase I was a short-term programme in order to upgrade existing facilities and improve the level of service at various points. This included widening, strengthening and renovating the runway, increasing the bearing capacity of the taxiways, construction of a new apron and an upgrade of the (old) terminal. Phase I was completed in 2001.Masterplan Phase I: 1997‚Äì2001 , visited 21 December 2011 Phase II included the construction of a radar facility and a new air traffic control tower, the construction of a new and more modern, , terminal, capable of handling 2.5 million passengers per year, and the construction of a Runway End Safety Area (RESA) of , including a overrun, on both ends of its runway, to comply with ICAO rules. The new air traffic control tower and the radar station commenced operations on 29 March 2004, while the new terminal opened in late October 2006.PJIAE Masterplan Phase II, visited 21 December 2011 The terminal has 4 jetways for large aircraft like 747s. If traffic develops as forecast, Phase III of the masterplan will be executed, consisting of an extension of the new terminal building and the construction of a full parallel taxiway system.PJIAE Masterplan: Phase III , visited 21 December 2011 In 1994, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and France signed the Franco-Dutch treaty on Saint Martin border controls, which allows for joint Franco-Dutch border controls on so-called \\"risk flights\\". After some delay, the treaty was ratified in November 2006 in the Netherlands, and subsequently entered into force on 1 August 2007. Runway after Hurricane Irma In July 2016, KLM announced that, starting in October, it would serve the airport with direct flights from Amsterdam instead of the triangle route via Cura√ßao. The previous triangle route used a Boeing 747. The new direct route would use an Airbus A330. Due to this change, the airport lost its last regularly scheduled Boeing 747 service. The 747 made its last appearance at the airport on 28 October 2016. Maho Beach was almost completely covered with tourists and plane- spotters who came to witness the last landing and departure of the aircraft. In September 2017 it did make a brief return in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, operating some relief flights. At the same time KLM announced the return of the triangle route via Cura√ßao, this time however operated by an Airbus A330. In September 2018, KLM officials confirmed that they hope to resume direct flights between Amsterdam and St. Maarten by November 2019. On 6 September 2017, the airport suffered significant damage when Hurricane Irma struck the island as a Category 5 hurricane. Video from a Dutch military helicopter showed the roof had been blown off the terminal, the jetways were damaged, and there was a significant amount of sand (blown through the fences from Simpson Bay Beach) and flooding on the runway. \\"World famous St Maarten airport destroyed by Hurricane Irma\\" 6 September 2017 The airport reopened on 10 October 2017 using temporary facilities while repair work commenced. Pavilions were in use during reconstruction of the main terminal. It was hoped to move the airport's departure and arrival operations into the ground floor of the main terminal building by November. In December 2018, temporary arrival and departure facilities opened within the first level of the terminal building. The entire upper floor of the terminal and the four jet-bridges remain temporarily out of commission. Facilities Warning sign between runway 10 and Maho Beach Spectators at Maho Beach Terminal interior =Runway= The airport has a single runway numbered 10/28, measuring 7,546 ft x 148 ft (2,300 m x 45 m).

It is usually eaten at Easter. Mythical origins Made for queen Sarah Magnano, it was used in the pagan celebrations of the return of the Spring time. During these celebrations, Ceres‚Äô priestess brought an egg, symbol of new life in procession. Because of the wheat or the einkorn, mixed with the soft ricotta cheese, it could come from the einkorn bread called \\"confarreatio\\", an essential ingredient in the ceremony of the type of ancient Roman weddings named after it. Another hypothesis we may consider is that it comes from ritual bread used, which spread during the period of Constantine the Great. They were made of honey and milk the people offered the catechumen during Easter Eve at the end of the ceremony of baptism. Origins and tradition A slice of pastiera Pastiere prepared for Easter The modern pastiera was probably invented in a Neapolitan convent. An unknown nun wanted that cake, symbol of the Resurrection, to have the perfume of the flowers of the orange trees which grew in the convent‚Äôs gardens. She mixed a handful of wheat to the white ricotta cheese, then she added some eggs, symbol of the new life, some water which had the fragrance of the flowers of the spring time, candied citron and aromatic Asian spices. We know for certain that the nuns of the ancient convent of San Gregorio Armeno were considered to be geniuses in the complex preparation of the Pastiera. They used to prepare a great quantity for the rich families during Easter time. There are two different ways of preparing pastiera: in the older, the ricotta is mixed with the eggs or with the grain; in the newer, thick pastry cream is added, making the pastiera softer.Francesconi (1995), p. 260 This innovation was introduced by Starace, a Neapolitan confectioner with a shop in a corner in Piazza Municipio (Town hall square). The pastiera has to be cooked some days in advance, no later than Maundy Thursday or Good Friday, in order to allow the fragrances to mix properly and result in that unique flavor. The Pastiera is not only cooked but also sold and served in appropriate pans called \\"ruoti\\" because it is very fragile, so it would easily crumble up if removed from the \\"ruoto\\".

This is in contrast to a byte-oriented filesystem, where the data is treated as an unformatted stream of bytes. There are several different possible record formats; the details vary depending on the particular system. In general the formats can be fixed-length or variable length, with different physical organizations or padding mechanisms; metadata may be associated with the file records to define the record length, or the data may be part of the record. Different access methods for records may be provided, for example records may be retrieved in sequential order, by key, or by record number.  Origin and characteristics  Record-oriented filesystems are frequently associated with mainframe operating systems, such as OS/360 and successors and DOS/360 and successors, and midrange operating systems, such as RSX-11 and VMS. However, they originated earlier in software such as Input/Output Control System (IOCS). Record-oriented filesystems can be supported on media other than direct access devices. A deck of punched cards can be considered a record-oriented file. A magnetic tape is an example of a medium that can support records of uniform length or variable length. In a record file system, a programmer designs the records that may be used in a file. All application programs accessing the file, whether adding, reading, or updating records share an understanding of the design of the records. In DOS/360, OS/360, and their successors there is no restriction on the bit patterns composing the data record, i.e. there is no delimiter character; this is not always true in other software, e.g., certain record types for RCA File Control Processor (FCP) on the 301, 501, 601 and 3301. The file comes into existence when a file create request is issued to the filesystem. Some information about the file may be included with the create request. This information may specify that the file has fixed-length records (all records are the same size) along with the size of the records. Alternatively, the specification may state that the records are of variable length, along with the maximum record length. Additional information including blocking factor, binary vs. text and the maximum number of records may be specified. It may be permitted to read only the beginning of a record; the next sequential read returns the next collection of data (record) that the writer intended to be grouped together. It may also be permitted to write only the beginning of a record. In these cases, the record is padded with binary zeros or with spaces, depending on whether the file is recognized as a binary file or a text file. Some operating systems require that library routines specific to the record format be included in the program. This means that a program originally expected to read a variable length record file cannot read a fixed length file. These operating systems must provide file system utilities for converting files between one format and another. This means copying the file (which requires additional storage space, time and coordination) may be necessary. Other operating systems include various routines and associate the appropriate routine, based on the file organization, at execution time. In either case, significant amounts of code to manage records must be provided in protected routines to ensure file integrity. An alternative to a Record- oriented file is a stream. In a stream file, in which the file system treats files as an unstructured sequence of bytes. The applications may, but need not, impose a record structure. This approach significantly reduces the size and complexity of the library and reduces the number of utilities required to maintain files. A common application convention for text files represented as streams is to use a new line delimiter to separate or terminate records, commonly CR, CRLF or LF. Unfortunately, the CPU time required to parse for the record delimiter is significant and the exclusion of the record delimiter pattern from the data is frequently undesirable. An alternate convention is to include a length field in each record. The writer application is responsible for imposing any record structure and the reader application is responsible for separating out the records.  Advantages and costs  A record oriented file has several advantages. After a program writes a collection of data as a record the program that reads that record has the understanding of that data as a collection. Although it is permitted to read only the beginning of a record, the next sequential read returns the next collection of data (record) that the writer intended to be grouped together. Another advantage is that the record has a length and there is no restriction on the bit patterns composing the data record, i.e. there is no delimiter character. There is a cost associated with record oriented files. The length definition takes up space. On a magnetic tape that definition takes the form of an inter-record gap. On a disk a meta data area must be allocated. This is minimal in a file where all the records are the same length. On a file composed of varying length records a maximum record length is defined to determine the size of the length metadata associated with each record.

It centres on Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun, who live next door to a Jewish couple, Arny and Rosa Goldenstein. The show spoofs elements of mid-20th century American sitcoms and is driven by Hitler's inability to get along with his neighbours. It caused controversy when broadcast and has been called \\"perhaps the world's most tasteless situation comedy\\". Premise The first episode opens with a caption card explaining Heil Honeys fictional back-story: it supposedly comprises the rediscovered \\"lost tapes\\" of an abandoned, never-aired American sitcom created by \\"Brandon Thalburg Jnr\\". In 1938, Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun live in Berlin, next door to a Jewish couple, Arny and Rosa Goldenstein. Hitler and Braun have little in common with their historical counterparts, acting more like a stock sitcom husband and wife. Hitler, for example, appears in a golfing sweater and cravat as well as military garb.The Listener, Volume 124, BBC, 1990 The Goldensteins are similarly hackneyed characters. The show is a spoof ‚Äî not of the Third Reich, but of the sort of sitcoms produced in the United States between the 1950s and 1970s \\"that would embrace any idea, no matter how stupid\\". In this spirit the title, plot and dialogue are deliberately vapid and corny and characters are applauded whenever they arrive on set. Patterned after I Love Lucy, the actors have New York accents. Plot of the first episode The plot of the first episode centres on the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, coming to the Hitler house. Not wanting the Goldensteins to interrupt the visit, Hitler instructs Braun to keep the news from Rosa, which she fails to do. Rosa duly invites herself over with hopes of matching Chamberlain with her dull niece Ruth. Hitler gets the Goldensteins drunk in an attempt to make them leave before Chamberlain arrives, but they stay.

Unlike the pilot episode, the other episodes had animated opening titles, similar in nature to those of Bewitched.

It was shown at 9.30pm on a Sunday, after an episode of Dad's Army. During the credits of Dad's Army, Galaxy's announcer said \\"And unless Arthur Lowe defeats him, it's the man himself in a few moments in Heil Honey, I'm Home!, as the Galaxy Comedy Weekend continues.\\"Heil Honey I'm Home Full Uncut Episode, YouTube, 8 May 2012 The programme proved controversial, with Hayim Pinner, secretary general of the Board of Deputies of British Jews describing the pilot as \\"in very bad taste\\", adding that: \\"We are against any trivialisation of the Second World War, Hitler or the Holocaust, and this certainly trivialises those things. It's very distasteful and even offensive.\\"The Fuehrer in Britain : New Satellite Service Pins Its Hopes on 'Dangerous' Hitler Sitcom, Jeff Kaye, Los Angeles Times, 23 October 1990 The television historian Marian Calabro described it as \\"perhaps the world's most tasteless situation comedy\\".Zap! A Brief History of Television, Marian Calabro, Four Winds Press, 1992, (p. 150). However, some commentators also point out the crassness was intentional, and an element of the parody - among these is David Hawkes, professor of English, who cites Heil Honey, I'm Home! as a \\"heavy- handed concept\\", and argues that the show was a failure as a comedy because it \\"disastrously exceeded\\" the limits of irony.David Hawkes, \\"British Contemporary Comedy\\", in Comedy: A Geographic and Historical Guide, edited by Maurice Charney. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005 (p. 197). Even so the show has reached a level of infamy where it still gets discussed in incredulous terms on retrospective programs. A video from GarethMarks.com, \\"Comedy Showreel\\" contains clips from pilot and unshown episodes. Arthur Mathews has said that the production company sent him a copy of the entire series. The filming of the series was cancelled immediately by Sky (BSkyB) on its acquisition of British Satellite Broadcasting. The show is one of the most controversial programmes ever to have been screened in the UK; it was listed at #61 on Channel 4's 100 Greatest TV Moments from Hell. Geoff Atkinson maintains that the aim of the show was not to shock, but to examine the appeasement surrounding Hitler in 1938. He concedes that the satire of this appeasement did not translate as well as he intended. Discussing the furore around the show, Atkinson has also stated that three quarters of the cast were Jewish and did not consider the concept controversial.

Its chief town was Limbourg-sur-Vesdre, is today located within the Belgian province of Li√®ge, with a small part in the neighbouring province of Belgian Limburg, within the east of Voeren. The Duchy evolved from a county which was first assembled under the lordship of a junior member of the House of Ardenne-Luxembourg, Frederick. He and his successors built and apparently named the fortified town which the county, and later the Duchy, were named after. Despite being a younger son, Frederick had a successful career and also became Duke of Lower Lotharingia in 1046.See Kupper p.612, including footnote 18. Lordship of this county was not originally automatically linked with possession of a ducal title (Herzog in German, Hertog in Dutch), and the same title also eventually contested by counts of Brabant, leading to the invention of two new Ducal titles: Brabant and Limbourg. The extinction of the line of Frederick's grandson Henry in 1283 sparked the War of the Limburg Succession, whereafter Limburg was ruled by the Dukes of Brabant in personal union, eventually being grouped together with the Brabantian \\"Overmaas\\" territories bordering it (including Dalhem, Valkenburg, and 's-Hertogenrade), to be one of the Seventeen Provinces of the Burgundian Netherlands. Unlike other parts of this province, the lands of the duchy stayed intact within the Southern Netherlands, under Habsburg control, after the divisions caused by the Eighty Years' War and the War of the Spanish Succession. However finally, after the failed Brabant Revolution in 1789, the duchy's history was terminated with the occupation by French Revolutionary troops in 1793. These lands were reunited within modern Belgium only after World War I. The duchy was multilingual, being the place where Dutch, French, and German dialects border upon each other and coexist at their geographical extremes, both now and in medieval times. Its northern and eastern borders are the approximate boundaries of the modern state of Belgium with the Netherlands and Germany, at their \\"tripoint\\". The eastern part, which includes Eupen, is the administrative capital and northernmost part of the modern German-speaking Community of Belgium. The Duchy also included the main part of the Pays de Herve, famous for its pungent-smelling soft cheese known as Limburger or Herve. Geography The state's territory was situated in the Low Countries between the river Meuse (Maas) in the west and the Imperial city of Aachen in the east. These lands had formed a very large lordship under Baelen on the route between the important imperial centres of Li√®ge and Aachen. They had chiefly been used for hunting, and not yet developed very much for agriculture. Frederick selected a natural prominence at an important intersection of roads which had probably been called \\"Heimersberch\\" or H√®vremont, and built his new comital caput there in about 1030.Kupper, p.617. Kupper has proposed that the new name for this place, Limburg, was taken from the name of the fort of the ruling Salian dynasty who had in about the same period given their possession to become Limburg Abbey. The most important towns in the eventual Duchy were Limbourg, the capital, and Eupen. The Limburg estates were commonly divided into five legal districts (Hochb√§nke): Basic administrative parts until the French revolution, including detached Sprimont. *The original manor of Baelen in the southeast with the fortified town of Limburg, and also Eupen, and Welkenraedt; *Herve in the southwest with Dison, Thimister and Clermont. *Montzen (today part of Plombi√®res) in the northwest with Kelmis, Moresnet, and Teuven; *Walhorn in the northeast with Eynatten, Hauset, and Lontzen; *The southwestern exclave of Sprimont, surrounded by the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge. The territory of Limburg formed a complex patchwork with those of the Prince- Bishopric of Li√®ge, based to the west, the Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy to the south, and the County of Luxembourg, to the south. In the east the main neighbour was the Rhenish Duchy of J√ºlich. To the north were the smaller lordships such as Slenaken, and Wittem and the lordships of Dalhem and Rolduc ('s-Hertogenrade), today in the Dutch province of Limburg, which came under Brabant control and were referred to in that context as the \\"Overmaas\\" territory, or even Limburg. In the northeast was the imperial city of Aachen. Linguistically Limburg was situated on the border of Germanic with Romance Europe. While in the northern and eastern districts Limburgish and Ripuarian dialects were spoken, the southwestern part around Herve was dominated by Walloon. History This shows the medieval \\"lands of Overmaas\\" and the Duchy of Limburg possessed in the Middle Ages by the Dukes of Brabant. Together these formed one province in the Seventeen Provinces, sometimes referred to as Limburg. The dark lines are modern borders. The territory of the duchy of Limburg was formed in the 11th century around the town of Limbourg in present- day Wallonia. About 1020, Duke Frederick of Lower Lorraine, a descendant of Count Palatine Wigeric of Lotharingia, had Limbourg Castle built on the banks of the Vesdre river. His estates then comprised the districts of Baelen (with Limbourg), Herve, Montzen (since 1975 part of Plombi√®res), Walhorn, and the southwestern exclave of Sprimont. Frederick's eventual successor (probably a grandson) was Henry, although between them was Count Udon, who about 1065 was also called a \\"count of Limburg\\". (It has been proposed that he married Frederick's daughter, and was the father of Henry.)Jean-Louis Kupper (2007) Les origines du duch√© de Limbourg-sur-Vesdre\\", Revue belge de Philologie et d'Histoire Ann√©e 85-3-4 pp. 609-637 Henry also claimed Frederick's ducal title, which was finally acknowledged by Emperor Henry IV in 1101. The Duchy of Limburg, like most of modern Belgium, was originally within the Duchy of Lower Lorraine. For a while, Lower Lorraine had its own single Duke. It is from this Duchy that the Duchy of Limbourg derived its Ducal status (as did the Duchy of Brabant, in a competitive claim to succession). This meant that Lower Lorraine came to have two Duchies, that of Brabant, and that of Limburg, and the title of Duke of Lothier, still held by Brabant, eventually became ineffective. As the Lorrainian ducal dignity was contested the title \\"duke of Limburg\\" arose, achieving confirmation from Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1165. The rise of the Limburg dynasty continued, when Duke Waleran III in 1214 became Count of Luxembourg by marriage with the heiress Ermesinde and his son Henry IV in 1225 became Count of Berg as husband of heiress Irmgard. This shows the two modern provinces called Limburg next to the medieval Duchy they are both named after. The small overlap is Teuven and Remersdaal, in eastern Voeren, a part of modern Belgian Limburg since 1977. However, upon the death of Henry's son Waleran IV in 1279, leaving only one heiress Irmgard, who had married Count Reginald I of Guelders but died childless in 1283, the War of the Limburg Succession broke out. The Duke of Brabant won the final Battle of Worringen in 1288, thereby gaining control of the Duchy of Limburg with the consent of King Rudolph I of Germany. Though it shared the fate of Brabant, Limburg remained a separate Imperial State, which in 1404 passed from Joanna of Brabant to Anthony of Valois, son of the Burgundian duke Philip the Bold. With the Burgundian heritage of Mary the Rich, it was bequested to her husband Maximilian I from the Austrian House of Habsburg in 1482. Combined with the Landen van Overmaas (the lands beyond the Meuse: Dalhem, Herzogenrath and Valkenburg) and Maastricht, the duchy became one of the Seventeen Provinces held by the Habsburgs within the Burgundian Circle established in 1512. Significant towns in Limburg proper were Herve, Montzen, Lontzen, Eupen, Baelen and Esneux. After the abdication of Emperor Charles V in 1556, the Burgundian fiefs passed to his son King Philip II of Spain. The measures of the Council of Troubles implemented by Philip's stern governor, the Duke of Alba, sparked the Eighty Years' War, ended by the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. An area known as Limburg of the States, consisting of parts of Overmaas (but no part of the Duchy of Limburg itself), was ceded to the Dutch Republic. In 1661, the Dutch and the Spanish agreed on a re-partition of the county of Dalhem. The duchy of Limburg itself remained undivided under Spanish Habsburg rule as part of the Southern Netherlands, passing to the Austrian Habsburgs under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. When the region was occupied by the French in 1794, the Austrian duchy of Limburg proper was disbanded and was incorporated into the d√©partement of Ourthe, while most of the Overmaas lands became part of the department Meuse-Inf√©rieure, which is the basis of today's Belgian and Dutch provinces called Limburg. After the defeat of the French empire, the eastern, German-speaking part of Duchy's lands were given to Prussia in the Congress of Vienna along with several other territories along what is today the Belgian-German border, but after the First World War, these lands became Belgian, re-uniting the original parts of the old Duchy.

Development The fundamental text of vegetotherapy is Wilhelm Reich's Psychischer Kontakt und vegetative Str√∂mung (1935), later included in the expanded edition of Reich's Character Analysis (1933 and 1949). The practice grew out of Reich's extension of psychoanalysis to cover what he called \\"character analysis\\",Franz Alexander et al eds., Psychoanalytic Pioneers (1995) p. 436 which involved alleviating a person's body armor and the character defenses that maintain an individual in a state of neurosis. Reich argued that \\"the feeling of unity of all body sensations ... increases with each new dissolution of an armor ring,\\"Wilhelm Reich, Character Analysis (1976) p. 372-3 leading ultimately to a merger with the autonomic functions of the body. He considered that \\"orgone physics reduces the emotional functions of humans even much further, to the forms of movement of molluscs and protozoa\\".Reich, p. 397 After his claim to have thus discovered \\"orgone\\" or life energy, vegetotherapy was accordingly adapted and succeeded by \\"psychiatric orgone therapy\\". Subsequently, neo-Reichian therapists have adopted the body work of vegetotherapy in various forms into their therapeutic practices.Tree Staunton, Body Psychotherapy (2002) p. 40  Practice  The practice of vegetotherapy involves the analyst enabling the patient to physically simulate the bodily effects of strong emotions. In this technique, the patient is asked to remove his or her outer clothing, lie down on a sheet-covered bed in the doctor's office, and breathe deeply and rhythmically.Description of Orgone Therapy 1Description of Orgone Therapy 2Description of Orgone Therapy 3 An additional technique is to palpate or tickle areas of muscular tension,A patient's description of vegetotherapy also known as \\"body armour\\". This activity and stimulation eventually causes the patient to experience the simulated emotions, thus theoretically releasing emotions pent up inside both the body and the psyche (compare with primal therapy). Screaming and vomiting may occur as the catharsis of emotive expression breaks down the cathexis of stored emotions. While experiencing a simulated emotional state, the patient may reflect on past experiences that may be the source of his or her unresolved emotions. These emotions are described as \\"stored emotions,\\" and in Reichian analysis are seen as manifesting in the body. Vegetotherapy relies on a theory of stored emotions, or affects, where emotions build tensions in the structure of the body. This tension can be seen in shallow or restricted breathing, posture, facial expression, muscular stress (particularly in the circular muscles), and low libido. Good sexual function and unrestricted, natural breathing are seen as evidence of recovery.Dr. Elsworth Baker on Orgonomy Examples of vegetotherapy, as well as interviews with analysts and patients who have undergone vegetotherapy, can be seen in the film Room for Happiness,film Room for Happiness directed by Dick Young and approved by the American College of Orgonomy. Criticism Psychoanalyst Otto Fenichel has criticized Reich's relaxation techniques. Although he accepts the fact that there are positive effects of vegetotherapy, he sees two potential problems. First, the possibility of psychological splitting that prevents changes in the body from affecting the mindOtto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (1946) p. 249 and second, the need for subsequent working through to integrate the abreacted material into the psyche.Fenichel, p. 562-3 See also Body psychotherapy * Gerda Boyesen * Neo-Reichian massage * Primal scream therapy References Bibliography Reich, Wilhelm: Psychic Contact and Vegetative Current.

Lesbian pulp fiction was published in the 1950s and 60s by many of the same paperback publishing houses as other genres of fiction including westerns, romances, and detective fiction. Because very little other literature was available for and about lesbians at this time, quite often these books were the only reference the public (lesbian and otherwise) had for modeling what lesbians were. Stephanie Foote, from the University of Illinois commented on the importance of lesbian pulp novels to the lesbian identity prior to feminism: \\"Pulps have been understood as signs of a secret history of readers, and they have been valued because they have been read. The more they are read, the more they are valued, and the more they are read, the closer the relationship between the very act of circulation and reading and the construction of a lesbian community becomes...Characters use the reading of novels as a way to understand that they are not alone.\\" These books were sold at drugstores, magazine stands, bus terminals and other places where one might look to purchase cheap, consumable entertainment. The books were small enough to fit in a purse or back pocket (hence both the brand-name and the generalized term \\"pocket books\\") and cheap enough to throw away when the reader was through with it. Development of the genre Cover of The Strange Path (1953) by Gale Wilhelm (illustration by Robert Maguire) In the early to mid-20th century, only a handful of books were published that addressed lesbians as characters in relationships with women. Those notable novels were published in hardcover and were as follows: *We Too Are Drifting (1935) Gale Wilhelm, Random House *Pity for Women (1937) Helen Anderson, Doubleday *Torchlight To Valhalla (1938, later titled The Strange Path when reissued in paperback in 1953) Gale Wilhem, Random House During World War II, the military distributed small paperbacks to its forces, causing a large population of Americans to become accustomed to having access to cheap books and thus creating a demand for the same easy access to reading material when the soldiers returned home. As a result, in the years after the war, there appeared a new and often subversive trend in publishing that allowed for books to be written, cheaply produced, and widely distributed using technology previously unavailable. These books were dubbed \\"pulp\\" fiction because they were inexpensive and usually sensational or low-brow, much like the \\"pulp\\" magazines of the first half of the 20th century. Pulps were not necessarily \\"low brow.\\" Many pulp authors are now celebrated with commemorative hardcover editions. These mass market paperbacks, printed and bound on cheap paper, often addressed \\"dirty\\" topics like drugs, gangs, white slavery, crime, murder, and homosexuality. Because the literature was not respected, it was not censored as readily, although most of the larger paperback publishers were wary of postal censorship, and, for instance, took care not to publish works that were overly supportive of \\"deviant\\" lifestyles. In terms of lesbian fiction, these books were the only ones available in many locations to people who had no previous access to information or stories that involved lesbian characters. Several publishing houses created special imprints, such as Fawcett's ‚ÄúGold Medal‚Äù division, to satisfy the demand for pulp fiction. Unlike many publishers, Fawcett made a point of publishing lesbian pulp written by lesbians, or sometimes by heterosexual women, rather than by heterosexual men. It made a significant contribution to the lesbian community to have lesbian authors writing more or less authentic stories about what it was like to be a lesbian, as opposed to only having heterosexual men writing stories about lesbians for the titillation of other men. Hundreds of lesbian pulp titles were published between 1950‚Äì1969, and millions of copies of each title were often were sold. This was part of no social agenda on the publishers' parts: they were making quite a bit of money.Hermes, Joke. \\"Sexuality in Lesbian Romance Fiction.\\" Feminist Review, 1992 p. 49-66. However prevalent the books were, purchasing and reading them for many women was the equivalent to coming out to the cashier. Author Joan Nestle called them \\"survival books\\" and described purchasing them: > The act of taking one of these books off the drugstore rack and paying for > it at the counter was a frightening and difficult move for most women. This > was especially true during the atmosphere of the McCarthy trials...Although > tame by today's standards...these volumes were so threatening then that > women hid them, burnt them, and threw them out.\\"Nestle, Joan. A Restricted > Country. Cleis Press, 2003. = Women's Barracks = Cover of Women's Barracks (1950) by Tereska Torr√®s The first paperback to address a lesbian relationship was published as early as 1950 with Women's Barracks by Tereska Torr√®s, published by Gold Medal Books. The story was a fictionalized account of Torres' experiences in the Free French Forces in London during World War II. Women's Barracks sold 4 million copies and was selected in 1952 to become an example of how paperback books were promoting moral degeneracy by the House Select Committee on Current Pornographic Materials.Women's Barracks - Tereska Torres Judith Mayne The Committee concluded their investigation with a report that required publishers to conform to certain moral standards in the content and publicizing of their books, or else face fines or imprisonment. As a result, authors were forced to limit their stories to fit these requirements. However, as the decade went on, publishers became bolder in printing material that might be judged as immoral. Cover of Spring Fire (1952) by Vin Packer (a.k.a. Marijane Meaker) = Spring Fire and the establishment of a formula = Accounting for the success of Women's Barracks, it is not a coincidence that Gold Medal Books published another paperback with lesbian themes, and in fact, eventually published some of the least homophobic books in the genre.In: Keller, Yvonne. \\"Was it Right to Love Her Brother's Wife So Passionately? Lesbian Pulp Novels and U.S. Lesbian Identity, 1950‚Äì1965.\\" American Quarterly, 2005 Spring Fire, by Marijane Meaker writing as Vin Packer, is generally considered to be the first lesbian paperback novel, since the plot focused on the relationship of the two main characters, as opposed to the various relationships examined in Women's Barracks. It is also the first modern lesbian novel written by a lesbian. Spring Fire, which was published by Gold Medal Books in 1952 and sold more than 1.5 million copies, is about two college girls, Mitch and Leda, who fall in love and have an affair. Spring Fire inspired one of the best-known authors of lesbian pulp, Ann Bannon. Bannon wrote to Meaker after reading the novel, and Meaker convinced her to submit her own manuscript to Gold Medal Books for publication in the genre. Beebo Brinker (1962) by Ann Bannon The tragic endings of Women's Barracks and Spring Fire (suicide and insanity) are typical of lesbian pulp novels. Meaker was told by her editor that because the books traveled through the mail and anything sent through the U.S. Postal Service was subject to government censorship, publishers had to make sure that the books seemed in no way to proselytize homosexuality.Packer, Vin. Spring Fire, Introduction. 2004, Cleis Press No character was allowed to be both homosexual and happy at the story's end. A character had either to turn heterosexual and end up coupled with a man or, if she remained homosexual, suffer death, insanity or some equally unappealing fate. The first exception to this formula, and technically not a pulp fiction, is the 1952 romance novel The Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith, published in hardcover by Coward-McCann under the pseudonym of \\"Claire Morgan\\". It was republished in 1953 as a Bantam Books lesbian pulp fiction paperback. Throughout the genre, satisfactory endings for women who accepted their homosexuality were rare. However, some authors defied the tragic endings. Ann Bannon published six lesbian novels between 1957 and 1962, a series known as the Beebo Brinker Chronicles. Bannon's novels ended happily, which changed the societal perception of lesbianism. Rather than being seen as \\"neurotic, frigid, immature, and even psychotic\\", lesbians were viewed as warm and loving. Bannon's novels paved the way for social acceptance of lesbianism and the queer sexual revolution. Content Content and quality of the books varied widely. Writer Yvonne Keller divides books within the lesbian pulp fiction genre into subclasses she labels \\"pro-lesbian\\" and \\"virile adventures\\". Pro-lesbian paperbacks were generally about and by women, featured a love story between women, had fairly well-developed characters, and tended not to feature gratuitous or graphic sexual encounters. Virile adventures were more male centered, perhaps with at least one male main character, and featured graphic depictions of sex. Author Paula Christian described her inspiration to write during this period: \\"Contemporary fiction showed such instability, violence, and sensationalism...I simply wanted to show the other side.\\" However, the majority of books in the lesbian paperback fiction genre promoted myths about lesbians and lesbianism. Women who are left without men can be seduced and violated by predatory lesbians (usually butch women). The depictions of lesbianism in prison, the military, and boarding schools was a well-used motif. Lesbianism was often linked to other topics that were seen as salacious or shocking at the time: witchcraft, Satanism, bondage and discipline, orgies, and voyeurism.Zimet, Jaye. Strange Sisters: The Art of Lesbian Pulp Fiction 1949 - 1969. Penguin Group, 1999. Many ‚Äúlesbian‚Äù pulps actually depict characters who may now be read as bisexual and who end up in heterosexual relationships at the end of their stories. During this time, however, bisexuality was seen less as a permanent identity and more as a stepping-stone to homosexuality or to various forms of sexual promiscuity. The vast majority of characters in lesbian pulp were white. Rea Michaels, writer of novels including Cloak of Evil and Duet in Darkness, stands out as one of the only pulp authors to include people of color and interracial relationships in her books and to have representations of lesbians of color on the covers of her novels. Barbara Grier, who started Naiad Press, called the years between 1950-1965 the \\"Golden Age of Lesbian Pulp Fiction\\". Grier republished many of the books in this span in the 1980s under Naiad, and Cleis Press and Feminist Press have again reissued them. Several writers of this \\"Golden Age\\" stood out for their contributions to gay and lesbian literature and their formation of a lesbian identity prior to the advent of feminism.  Authors  Authors of lesbian paperbacks were both male and female, and often used pseudonyms - the male authors frequently used female names. One retrospective summed up the genre as, \\"The vast majority of these lesbian novels were written by men, designed to fulfill straight men's fantasies...But perhaps 40 or 50 lesbian (pulp) novels were written by women, and were also good enough to becoming underground classics...The pulps also reached isolated, small-town lesbians who could read them and see that they were not the only lesbians in the world.\\"Yusba, Roberta, \\"Twilight Tales: Lesbian Pulps 1950-1960,\\" On Our Backs, 2.1 Summer, 1985: p. 30. Cover of I Am a Woman (1959) by Ann Bannon =Ann Bannon= Ann Bannon (Ann Weldy b. 1932) wrote six lesbian themed pulp novels from 1957 to 1962 that later became known as The Beebo Brinker Chronicles. The popularity of the books as well as the continuity of characters gave them a remarkable longevity and earned her the title, \\"Queen of Lesbian Pulp Fiction.\\" Her books were re-released in 1983 and again in 2001. Bannon wrote: Odd Girl Out, 1957 Gold Medal Books; I Am a Woman, 1959 Gold Medal Books; Women in the Shadows, 1959 Gold Medal Books; Journey to a Woman, 1960 Gold Medal Books; The Marriage, 1960 Gold Medal Books; Beebo Brinker, 1962 Gold Medal Books. Valerie Taylor (illustration by James Meese) =Valerie Taylor= Valerie Taylor (Velma Nacella Young 1913-1997) wrote eight lesbian themed novels from 1957-1964, poetry that was published in The Ladder, and several novels in the 1970s through Naiad Press. She became a gay activist, co-founding the Mattachine Society and the Lesbian Writers' Conference in Chicago in 1974. Taylor wrote: Whisper Their Love, 1957 Gold Medal Books; The Girls in 3-B, 1959 Gold Medal Books; Stranger on Lesbos, 1960 Gold Medal Books; A World Without Men, 1963 Midwood-Tower; Unlike Others, 1963 Midwood-Tower; Journey to Fulfillment, 1964 Midwood-Tower. Cover of We, Too, Must Love (1958) by Ann Aldrich (a.k.a. Marijane Meaker) (illustration by John Floherty =Marijane Meaker= Marijane Meaker (born 1927) wrote under the pen names of Vin Packer and Ann Aldrich, as well as serving as a copy-editor for Gold Medal Books. Packer's books were generally mystery novels, but using her Ann Aldrich name she wrote nonfiction books about lesbians that were not overly sympathetic about lesbianism and earned Meaker the ire of the Daughters of Bilitis printed in The Ladder. Barbara Grier once referred to her as \\"the evil genius.\\" Meaker later wrote books for young adults under the names M. E. Kerr and Mary James. Meaker wrote: Spring Fire, 1952 Gold Medal Books; We Walk Alone, 1955 Gold Medal Books; We, Too, Must Love, 1958 Gold Medal Books; Carol in a Thousand Cities, 1960 Gold Medal Books; We Two Won't Last, 1963 Gold Medal Books; Take a Lesbian to Lunch, 1972. =Marion Zimmer Bradley= Cover of I Am a Lesbian (1962) by Lee Chapman (a.k.a. Marion Zimmer Bradley) Monarch Books Marion Zimmer Bradley (1930‚Äì1999) wrote under various pen names, eventually becoming quite popular for her Avalon and Darkover series. For years Bradley refused to admit she authored her early paperback lesbian fiction, and was reluctant to publicly speak about her work on The Ladder. Bradley wrote: I Am a Lesbian, 1962 as Lee Chapman; No Adam for Eve, 1966 as John Dexter; My Sister, My Love, 1963 as Miriam Gardner; Twilight Lovers, 1964 as Miriam Gardner; The Strange Women, 1967 as Miriam Gardner; Spare Her Heaven, 1963 as Morgan Ives; Anything Goes, 1964 as Morgan Ives; Knives of Desire, 1966 as Morgan Ives. =Artemis Smith= Cover of Odd Girl (1959) by Artemis Smith (a.k.a. Annselm Morpurgo) Cover of This Bed We Made (1961) by Artemis Smith (a.k.a. Annselm Morpurgo) (illustration by Rafael DeSoto) Annselm L.N.V. Morpurgo (1934 - ) also known as the founder of the 1950s Unisex Movement, wrote under various pen names, including Carle for ONE Magazine, as well as under A.S. Morpurgo, Diana Carleton Rhodes, Artemis Smith, and presently also under Artemis Smith, Grandma MoseX, and Annselm LNVM. She further collaborated in the arts with her life-partner Billie Ann Taulman (1929-2008), known to The Ladder as Billie Bruce, whose iconic sketch of Artemis Smith was published on one of the magazine's covers. Taulman wrote one of the chapters in Artemis Smith's The Third Sex and is now credited in re-issues, which also contain numerous scientific papers on the nature of self-consciousness and gender identity, written by Smith as a professional bioepistemologist. In her 1960s addresses to East Coast homophile organizations meetings in Philadelphia, Artemis Smith originated the \\"come out of the closet\\" slogan and strategy for linking the gay rights movement to other rights movements in which, as both novelist and playwright, she was also a spokeswoman. Smith's Odd Girl and The Third Sex were published by Beacon Books in 1959 after multiple rejections by major publishers. Unlike former pulp novels, these also contained strong political statements that influenced the formation of the gay rights movements of the late 1950s. Originally titled Anne Loves Beth, Odd Girl was extensively blue-penciled by the pulp editors. The original version has recently been reissued by the author through 'the savant garde workshop', a service press for The Savant Garde Institute, which also continues to publish her many collected papers, plays, novels, and poetry. Her most important artistic work, Testament of Sarah (Book I of The SKEETS Triptych. 1967), was originally to be published by Doubleday & Co. Under classic pulp fiction, Artemis Smith wrote: The Third Sex, 1959 Beacon Books; Odd Girl, 1959 Beacon Books; This Bed We Made, 1961 Monarch Books. Cover art Cover of Flying Lesbian (1963) by Del Britt (illustration by Fred Fixler) Lesbian pulp novels typically had lurid, titillating cover art. Although many women (lesbian and otherwise) bought and read these novels, book publishers marketed them to men as erotic fantasy. Covers might have a few provocative lines of text meant to draw attention to the sexy and scandalous nature of what was between the covers. Publishers inserted words such as \\"twilight\\", \\"odd\\", \\"strange\\", \\"shadows\\", and \\"queer\\" in the titles of these books.Walters, Suzanne. \\"Her Hand Crept Slowly Up Her Thigh.\\" Social Text, 1989 p. 83-101 Author Ann Bannon has stated that men would read the covers literally, attracted to the art of half-dressed women in a bedroom scene, and women would read the covers iconically: two women looking at each other, or one woman standing, another on a bed, with the trigger words of \\"strange\\" or \\"twilight\\" meaning that the book had lesbian content in it. Bannon was appalled by the covers that Fawcett provided for her Beebo Brinker Chronicles. Melissa Sky argues that there was a definitive type for these covers that often displayed illustrations that did not correspond to the material inside. Additionally, the covers of lesbian pulp novels often presented lesbian relationships as dangerous and questioned whether lesbians could really be seen as women, exposing deeper anxieties about the stability of the gender and sexual norms of the 1950s. Furthermore, the covers often included blurbs on both the front and the back that emphasized the message of the illustration. These blurbs would praise the authors for their bravery in addressing their subject with honesty. They also portrayed the content of the novels as scandalous and sensational, and made it clear that the reader would find sex scenes inside. Additionally, some blurbs were written by doctors, who would recommend the books on the basis of their value as case studies, suggesting that people would read the novels for their educational value and demonstrating the way in which lesbianism was pathologized at the time. Decline and republishing In 1964, Desert of the Heart by Jane Rule (loosely adapted as the 1985 film Desert Hearts) and Mrs. Stevens Hears the Mermaids Singing by May Sarton in 1965 were published by mainstream publishers in hardback, both enjoying a fairly successful run. Patience and Sarah (originally self-published by author Alma Routsong in 1969) is considered the first novel to initiate a feminist publishing run. In 1973, Naiad Press was founded by Barbara Grier which concentrated mainly on lesbian-themed books. The growth of the pornographic industry after a series of United States Supreme Court decisions disallowing the censorship of pornographic material, was evident in books that served to be more graphic in nature than focusing on the relationships of the women in the stories, which also led to the decline of lesbian pulp fiction. Authors March Hastings and Paula Christian both stated their publishers lost interest in their subject in the mid-1960s. As well, common plot points in the books involved women who were coming to terms with realizing their attraction to women in a world that did not allow it. With the rise of feminism, and the gay rights movement in 1969, these plot points were decreasingly relevant. However, certain lesbian pulp novels, including Ann Bannon's books, were reprinted in the 1980s by Naiad Press with the goal of bringing lesbian authors to light. Naiad provided new covers for the books, for example portraying silhouettes of lesbian couples on the covers of Bannon's novels. Melissa Sky argues that, due to the political motivations of Naiad Press, ‚Äúthe cover art betrays a feminist ambivalence towards the kinds of non-egalitarian relationships depicted in Bannon's series,‚Äù specifically the butch-femme relationships that were often central to lesbian bar culture of the 1950s. In the early 2000s, the queer publisher Cleis Press again republished Bannon's novels, this time with covers in the style of 1950s pulp covers. Although the cover illustrations were taken from real pulp novels, they were not the original covers of the Beebo Brinker Chronicles. Sky argues that the Cleis versions emphasize the camp quality of lesbian pulp. In 2005 an anthology titled \\"Lesbian Pulp Fiction\\" was published by Katherine Forrest.Ms Forrest's forward provides further information on the genre and history. Patricia Highsmith's The Price of Salt was adapted into the 2015 film Carol by Phyllis Nagy and directed by Todd Haynes. Starring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, it received numerous accolades, bringing a 1950s lesbian \\"pulp story\\" to a wider modern audience. Reemergence of lesbian pop fiction In much the same way as publication of the 1950s/1960s pulp novels was made possible by new technology, another wave of lesbian literature came into existence due to the new technologies of the 1980s to the present. In the 1980s and 1990s, lesbian fan fiction surged to the forefront with hundreds of authors writing stories, novels, and whole series and making them available online via the Internet. This online publication continues to be popular to this day. In the 2000s, with increased availability of the internet and awareness of the genre, authorship grew into the tens of thousands. Many of the authors who wrote in the 1980s and 1990s gravitated away from fan fiction and began to write original works, and small presses sprang up to publish that work. With the proliferation of offset printing and the subsequent widespread availability of print on demand technology and desktop publishing, for the first time in history, small presses with little capital began to regularly publish lesbian voices. By the turn of the 21st century, over a dozen lesbian fiction and nonfiction publishers had emerged, and they are successfully marketing hundreds of new titles yearly for the lesbian audience. The three largest publishers going into this new millennium are Bella Books, Bold Strokes Books, and Regal Crest Enterprises. The development of electronic E-books has made it possible for out-of-print books to be made available again. Many pulp novels have been reissued in e-book form, and most print books published today are also issued as e-books.

It follows the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River from the border with the state of New York in the hamlet of Dundee (connecting with New York State Route 37 (NY 37) via NY 970T, an unsigned reference route, north of Massena), west of Montreal to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and circles the Gasp√© Peninsula. This highway is known as the Navigator's Route. It passes through the Mont√©r√©gie, Centre-du-Qu√©bec, Chaudi√®re-Appalaches, Bas-Saint-Laurent and Gasp√©sie regions of the province. Unlike the more direct Autoroute 20, which it shadows from Longueuil to Luceville, Route 132 takes a more scenic route which goes through many historic small towns. Until the connection between Rivi√®re-du-Loup and Le Bic is completed, this highway provides a link between the two sections of Autoroute 20. At Rivi√®re-du-Loup, the Trans-Canada Highway continues south on Autoroute 85 to Edmundston, New Brunswick. This eastern section of the highway, from Rivi√®re-du-Loup towards Gasp√©, was the former Route 6, until the early 1970s realignment of route numbers into a grid. Route 132 split in Sainte-FlavieAt Sainte-Flavie, the highway splits and one branch turns south following the valley of the Matap√©dia River to reach the New Brunswick border near Campbellton, joining New Brunswick Route 11, a major highway along that province's eastern coast. The other branch continues east to follow the coast of the Gasp√© peninsula and eventually rejoin the other branch at Matap√©dia. The total length of this loop is over 930 km. Route 132 in La Prairie Between Candiac and Varennes, the highway overlaps various current and former Quebec Autoroutes and can be considered a continuous autoroute by itself, as it runs along the Saint Lawrence River through most of this section. Highway 132 joins Autoroute 15 in Candiac at its Exit 42 and overlaps it until Exit 53 (on the other side Exit 75 of Autoroute 20), in Brossard, where Autoroute 15 separates onto Champlain Bridge.

During the early 1990s he was also the leader of the far-right political organization \\"Mi≈ücarea pentru Rom√¢nia\\" (The movement for Romania). Munteanu was the leader of the Students' League, which was one of organizers of the protests against Ion Iliescu's rule. On June 14, 1990, he was severely beaten. A miner was later imprisoned for attempted murder following witnesses' declarations that he had tried to kill Munteanu using an axe. He was arrested and detained at Jilava between June 18 and August 2, 1990. As a leader of \\"Mi»ôcarea pentru Rom√¢nia\\" (defunct since 1996), he wrote several articles expressing his admiration for the Iron Guard, a local fascist movement active before World War II. Consequently, he has been condemned for antisemitic discourse by various public figures, notably literary critic Nicolae Manolescu. In 2000, Munteanu was presented as a presidential candidate by the party led by Virgil MƒÉgureanu, former Securitate officer and first head of the Romanian Intelligence Service, though he eventually withdrew from the race. As of 2011, he was teaching ethnology, anthropology and folklore at the University of Bucharest. Munteanu made a comeback into politics in 2016 after accepting National Liberal Party's proposal as candidate for mayor of Bucharest for that year's local elections. The proposal was regarded as controversial at best, coming after the previous candidate, Ludovic Orban, was withdrawn as a result of his prosecution for corruption by the National Anticorruption Directorate. Soon after, documents surfaced on the Internet indicating Munteanu as a former collaborator of the Securitate, Nicolae Ceau»ôescu's secret police, having signed an agreement for furnishing information and being paid for. He was approached by the secret police after he became a confidante of Petre »öu»õea, with the purpose of keeping under surveillance the former anticommunist. Munteanu refused to sign an official proof of integrity document, as required to candidates for public positions. Several organizations and even the National Liberal Party have filed official requests with the National Council for the Study of the Securitate Archives (CNSAS), to check the ties he might have had with the Securitate before 1989. Following public outcry, the National Liberals decided to drop him as party candidate. Later in 2016 Munteanu created a new political movement in order to run in the elections for the Parliament.

TUS is a subsidiary of Thales Naval, part of the Thales Group, and has sites in the United Kingdom, France, and Australia. TUS is made up of three subsidiary companies: TUS Ltd. in the UK, TUS SAS in France and TUS Pty. in Australia, but it operates as a single company with headquarters in southern France. TUS had annual sales of ‚Ç¨400 million in 2006 and employed around 2,100 people. TUS Ltd. TUS Ltd. has two main sites, Cheadle Heath near Stockport, Greater Manchester and Templecombe in Somerset. The company had a turnover of around ¬£85 million with a total of 853 staff in 2006. =Cheadle Heath= The Cheadle Heath site was set up in 1977 as an overspill of the Ferranti Military Systems Division based at Wythenshawe. It comprised groups covering training simulators, communication systems and a small Underwater Systems Group which was engaged in the development of displays and computer interfaces for sonars equipment. The main parts of these sonars were developed by the Plessey Marine Research Unit at Templecombe, Somerset. The sonar work at the Cheadle Heath site expanded into digital signal processing, algorithm development, display generation, simulation, LCD and TV displays, mass storage, computer interfaces and highways. Takeovers of other companies brought new expertise in sonar arrays. The Sonar Systems Group increased in size and successfully bid against Plessey for parts of sonar 2054. Other parts of the Ferranti empire started to crumble, aided by the merger with International Signal (James Guerin) in 1987 to form Ferranti International. Ferranti eventually went bankrupt (again) in 1993, however the small, idiosyncratic Sonar Systems Group had become a successful standalone business. A Joint Venture Company was formed between the Ferranti liquidators (49.9%) and Thomson-CSF (50.1%) to form Ferranti Thomson Sonar Systems. The Ferranti share was bought out by GEC-Marconi to become Thomson Marconi Sonar Systems. FTSS had outstations at Weymouth for aquaculture sonar and other special systems. This is now closed along with its Church Crookham site. The site is now a combined focal hypocentre for both the Underwater and Information systems division. =Templecombe= The Templecombe part of TUS started life in 1965 as the Marine Systems Research Unit of the Marine Systems Division of the Plessey Company, then it became Plessey Marine Research Unit, and Plessey Marine, before becoming Plessey Naval Systems, producing sonar and other related systems. The Marine Systems Division was established in 1961 at Uppark Drive Ilford but originated in a specialist underwater unit formed by the Plessey Company in 1948. The sites at Ilford carried out manufacturing and support of the older sonars, such as Type 195, and the Mark 44 torpedo. A manufacturing and support site at Newport, Wales was set up for later sonars and gradually the sites at Ilford closed. The headquarters of Plessey Marine was transferred to Templecombe. Plessey took over a company called Ameeco Hydrospace in the 1970s which specialised in building towed arrays. This had sites in Andover and Gillingham. The sites at Andover were eventually closed and the work transferred to Newport. Plessey Naval Systems was taken over in 1989 by GEC-Marconi, the defence arm of GEC, to eventually merge with Marconi Underwater Systems Ltd. After the sonar systems businesses of Thomson-CSF and Ferranti were merged (creating Ferranti Thomson Sonar Systems), GEC-Marconi acquired Ferranti's share, and the company became Thomson Marconi Sonar (TMS). Marconi Underwater Systems Ltd became a part of this company. In 1999, as part of the merger of Marconi Electronic Systems (as GEC-Marconi had become), and British Aerospace, the new BAE Systems held 49.9% of TMS, which it sold to Thales (the new name for Thomson-CSF) in 2001. Thomson Marconi Sonar was renamed Thales Underwater Systems and the original part of MUSL became part of BAE Systems. The UK headquarters of TUS is at Templecombe. The original site at Templecombe was at Wilkinthroop House and later because of expansion a site at Throop Road was added. The Throop Road site was previously the railyard of the Somerset and Dorset Railway. The other railway line from London to Exeter, which the line joined linked to is still operational, and Templecombe station is still used today. Because of restrictions at the former site, all work was later transferred to the latter one and Wilkinthroop House sold off. A flooded quarry at Waterlip was acquired as a test site in the 1960s but problems led to testing being transferred to a site at Vobster. However, further problems there led to testing resuming at Waterlip. The Newport site was closed and manufacturing transferred back to Templecombe. In addition there have been sites in Bath (due to the then-proximity to MoD offices in and around the city, now entirely moved to DESG MoD Abbey Wood) for Prime Contract Management and a Joint Plessey Ferranti Office at Portland to support the Admiralty Research Establishment, but both are now closed. Plessey Naval Systems also had a site at Carlsbad California for USN support. =Church Crookham= One of the sites of Ferranti Thomson Sonar Systems, but a relatively small site within Thales. The Church Crookham site housed a production and test facility for towed array sonars and submarine flank arrays, a design department, and a special projects section. It had a large involvement in Sonar 2076, and for a period provided acoustic calibration services for naval vessels. Now closed. TUS SAS =Brest= This site specialises in minecountermeasures sonar, sonar buoys data processing and dipping sonars for submarine detection. =Sophia-Antipolis= TUS Pty Ltd =Meadowbank= This was the main manufacturing facility until 1995 when it was transferred to Rydalmere.

Disposal methods may need to account for the fact that soft tissue will decompose relatively rapidly, while the skeleton will remain intact for thousands of years under certain conditions. Several methods for disposal are practiced. A funeral is a ceremony that may accompany the final disposition. Regardless, the manner of disposal is often dominated by spirituality with a desire to hold vigil for the dead and may be highly ritualized. In cases of mass death, such as war and natural disaster, or in which the means of disposal are limited, practical concerns may be of greater priority. Ancient methods of disposing of dead bodies include cremation practiced by the Romans, Greeks, and Hindus; burial practiced by the Jews, Christians, and Muslims; mummification practiced by the Ancient Egyptians; and the sky burial and a similar method of disposal called Towers of Silence practiced by Tibetan Buddhists and Zoroastrians.  Commonly practiced legal methods  Some cultures place the dead in tombs of various sorts, either individually, or in specially designated tracts of land that house tombs. Burial in a graveyard is one common form of tomb. In some places, burials are impractical because the groundwater is too high; therefore tombs are placed above ground, as is the case in New Orleans, Louisiana, US. Elsewhere, a separate building for a tomb is usually reserved for the socially prominent and wealthy; grand, above- ground tombs are called mausoleums. The socially prominent sometimes had the privilege of having their corpses stored in church crypts. In more recent times, however, this has often been forbidden by hygiene laws. Burial was not always permanent. In some areas, burial grounds needed to be reused due to limited space. In these areas, once the dead have decomposed to skeletons, the bones are removed; after their removal they can be placed in an ossuary. =Ground burial= A burial is usually accomplished by excavating a pit or trench, placing the deceased and objects in it, and covering it over. Humans have been burying their dead since shortly after the origin of the species. Burial is often seen as indicating respect for the dead. It has been used to prevent the odor of decay, to give family members closure and prevent them from witnessing the decomposition of their loved ones. =Cremation= Cremation is also an old custom; it was the usual mode of disposing of a corpse in ancient Rome (along with graves covered with heaped mounds, also found in Greece, particularly at the Karameikos graveyard in Monastiraki). Vikings were occasionally cremated in their longships, and afterwards the location of the site was marked with standing stones. Since the latter part of the twentieth century, despite the objections of some religious groups, cremation has become increasingly popular. Jewish law (Halakha) forbids cremation, believing that the soul of a cremated person will be unable to find its final repose. The Roman Catholic Church forbade it for many years, but since 1963 the church has allowed it, as long as it is not done to express disbelief in bodily resurrection. The church specifies that cremated remains are either buried or entombed; they do not allow cremated remains to be scattered or kept at home. Many Catholic cemeteries now have columbarium niches for cremated remains, or specific sections for those remains. Some denominations of Protestantism allow cremation; the more conservative denominations generally do not. The Eastern Orthodox Church and Islam also forbid cremation.What is Cremation, Cremation Association of North America. Among Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and some sects of Buddhists such as those found in Japan, cremation is common. =Immurement= Immurement of corpses is the permanent storage in an above-ground tomb or mausoleum. A tomb is generally any structurally enclosed interment space or burial chamber, of varying sizes. A mausoleum may be considered a type of tomb, or the tomb may be considered to be within the mausoleum. Less common legal methods =Sky Burial= Sky Burial allows dead bodies to be eaten by vultures on open grounds or on top of specially built tall towers away from human sight. It is more ecological to allow the dead bodies to be quickly eaten by the highly evolved vultures than burials in which the dead bodies slowly rot in the soil and are eaten by the maggots and bacteria. Sky Burial is also more eco-friendly than cremation, which wastes dead bodies, requires fuel and produces air pollution. Sky Burials can be followed by optional automatic cremations of the skeletons left behind. Ancient Persians, Tibetans and some Native Americans practiced sky burials.Martin, Dan. ‚ÄúOn the Cultural Ecology of Sky Burial on the Himalayan Plateau.‚Äù East and West, vol. 46, no. 3/4, 1996, pp. 353‚Äì370. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/29757283. Accessed 13 Oct. 2020. =Burial at sea= \\"Burial at sea\\" in past generations has meant the deliberate disposal of a corpse into the ocean, wrapped and tied with weights to make sure it sinks. It has been a common practice in navies and seafaring nations; in the Church of England, special forms of funeral service were added to the Book of Common Prayer to cover it. In today's generation, \\"burial at sea\\" may also refer to the scattering of ashes in the ocean, while \\"whole body burial at sea\\" refers to the entire uncremated body being placed in the ocean at great depths. Laws vary by jurisdictions. The concept may also include ship burial, a form of burial at sea in which the corpse is set adrift on a boat. =Exposure= Rarer forms of disposal of the dead include exposure to the elements and to scavenger animals. This includes various forms of excarnation, where the corpse is stripped of the flesh, leaving only the bones, which are then either buried or stored elsewhere, in ossuaries or tombs for example. This was done by some groups of Native Americans in protohistoric times. Ritual exposure of the dead (without preservation of the bones) is practiced by Zoroastrians in Mumbai and Karachi, where bodies are placed in \\"Towers of Silence\\", where vultures and other carrion-eating birds dispose of the corpses. In the present-day structures, the bones are collected in a central pit where, assisted by lime, they, too, eventually decompose. Exposure to scavenger birds (with preservation of some, but not all bones) is also practiced by some high- altitude Tibetan Buddhists, where practical considerations such as the lack of firewood and a shallow active layer seem to have led to the practice known as jhator or \\"giving alms to the birds\\". A body farm involves a similar method of disposal as an object of scientific study. In some traditions, for example that practiced by the Spanish royal family, the soft tissues are permitted to rot over a period of decades, after which the bones are entombed. =Mummification= Takabuti, an Egyptian mummy from the 7th century BC Mummification is the drying of bodies to preserve them. The most famous practitioners were ancient Egyptians‚Äîmany nobles and highly ranked bureaucrats had their corpses embalmed and stored in luxurious sarcophagi inside their funeral mausoleums. Pharaohs stored their embalmed corpses in pyramids. =Composting= Composting turns organic matter into soil conditioner. For human corpses, it can be performed by placing the body in a mix of wood chips, allowing thermophile microbes to decompose the body. In the United States, this method is only legalized in Washington. =Dissolution= Dissolution involves the breaking down of the body by solvation, e.g. in acid or a solution of lye, followed by disposal as liquid. A specific method is alkaline hydrolysis (also called Resomation). Advocates claim the process is more environmentally friendly than both cremation and burial, due to emissions and embalming fluids respectively. On the other hand, many find the idea of being \\"poured down the drain\\" to be undignified.A rival to burial: Dissolving bodies with lye, NBC News. =Other less common= Donation for study ‚Äì donation to a medical school or similar ‚Äì after embalming and several years of study and dissection the body is usually eventually cremated. * Space burial * In cases of war, genocide, or natural disasters including disease epidemics, large groups of people have been buried in mass graves or plague pits. * Dismemberment, in which the body is divided and different body parts are dealt with separately; for example in the case of the Habsburg royal family as well as the display of the relics of various saints. Means of preservation In some cases an attempt is made to preserve some or all of a body. These methods include: * Cryopreservation * Mummification; the most well-known examples are from ancient Egypt * Taxidermy; an extremely rare form of preserving a human body. Famous historical examples include an African tribesman, and sideshow performer Julia Pastrana. * Plastination: The preserved (embalmed) body is prepared by dissection or slicing and fluids are replaced with inert plastic for anatomical study by medical students or display in museums. This technique was pioneered by Gunther von Hagens of the Institute for Plastination. Human remains of archaeological or medical interest are often kept in museums and private collections. This practice is controversial (See NAGPRA). In the cases of Native Americans in the United States, possession of remains and related objects is regulated by the NAGPRA Act of 1990. Preparation for disposal Different religions and cultures have various funeral rites that accompany the disposal of a body. Some require that all parts of the body are buried together. If an autopsy has occurred, removed parts of the body are sewn back into the body so that they may be buried with the rest of the corpse. When it is not possible for a body to be disposed of promptly, it is generally stored at a morgue. Where this is not possible, such as on a battlefield, body bags are used. In the Western world, embalming of the body is a standard part of preparation. This is intended to temporarily preserve the corpse throughout the funeral process. Legal regulation Many jurisdictions have enacted regulations relating to the disposal of human bodies. Although it may be entirely legal to bury a deceased family member, the law may restrict the locations in which this activity is allowed, in some cases expressly limiting burials to property controlled by specific, licensed institutions. Furthermore, in many places, failure to properly dispose of a body is a crime. In some places, it is also a crime to fail to report a death, and to fail to report the disposal of the body. Body parts Certain conditions such as necrosis can cause parts of the body such as limbs or internal organs to die without causing the death of the individual. In such cases the body parts are usually not given a funeral. Surgical removal of dead tissue is usually necessary to prevent gangrenous infection. Surgically removed body parts are typically disposed of as medical waste, unless they need to be preserved for cultural reasons, as described above. Conversely, donated organs or tissue may live on long after the death of an individual. Criminal disposal In some cases, a body is disposed of in such a way as to prevent, hinder, or delay discovery of the body, to prevent identification of the body, or to prevent autopsy. In such cases, the deceased is considered a missing person as long as a body is not identified, unless death is so likely that the person is declared legally dead. This often occurs as part of a murder or voluntary manslaughter. In other cases, an individual who did not intend to cause death may still feel guilt about a death (e.g. by involuntary manslaughter or an accident) and may attempt to prevent discovery of the body. This can exacerbate any legal consequences associated with the death. Other motives for concealing death or the cause of death include insurance fraud or the desire to collect the pension of the deceased. An individual may commit suicide in such a way as to obscure the cause of death, allowing beneficiaries of a life insurance policy to collect on the policy. Criminal methods encountered in fiction and actual cases include: * Illegal use of conventional methods, commonly burial in a place unlikely to draw attention, or water disposal (e.g. Cleveland Torso Murderer) * Dissolution was used by Jeffrey Dahmer, smashing or dissolving the skeleton * Cannibalism (e.g. Jeffrey Dahmer) * Grinding into small pieces for disposal in nature, disposal via a sewer system, or use as fertilizer * Boiling (used by Futoshi Matsunaga and Dennis Nilsen) * Encasing in concrete (e.g. murder of Junko Furuta) * Hiding in trash or landfill (e.g. murder of David Stack, disappearance of Natalee Holloway) * Feeding to animals (e.g. pigs or flesh-eating insects; used by Ted Bundy and Robert Pickton) * Abandonment in an area where the body can degrade significantly before being discovered, if ever, such as a remote area (e.g. West Mesa murders), cave, abandoned well, abandoned mine, or a neglected or hazardous third-party property (known as a dump job); sometimes dropped in an easily discovered but out-of-the-way location to obscure the identity of the murderer (e.g. Fountain Avenue, Brooklyn) * Dropping into a destructive or impassible natural hazard, such as a volcano, quicksand, or crevasse * Destruction by industrial process, such as machinery, chemical bath, molten metal, or a junked car * Injection into the legitimate body disposal system (e.g. morgue, funeral home, cemetery, crematorium, funeral pyre, cadaver donation) or killings at a health care facility (e.g. Ann Arbor Hospital Murders and Dr. X killings) * Burning, often in a building (e.g. possibly the Clinton Avenue Five) * Disguising as animal flesh (e.g. abattoir, food waste, food; as Katherine Knight did) * Attachment to a vehicle traveling to a distant place * Creating false evidence of the circumstances of death and letting investigators dispose of the body, possibly obscuring identity * Indefinite storage (e.g. in a freezer or refrigerator, as in the murder of Paul Marshall Johnson, Jr.) =Illegal disposal of bodies in water= Disposal of this type happens for various reasons, including the main difference between a burial at sea and a burial on land: the difficulty in recovering the body. Sometimes this difference is desired to dispose of bodies outside of the law. Disposal of evidence There may be a number of reasons for this kind of crime. One common reason for this behavior is to dispose of the evidence. The body may be the victim of a homicide, as for example murder or manslaughter. In some cases, the victim may even be still alive and drowning during the process. A live victim is usually restrained to reduce the likelihood of the victim freeing themselves or fighting back, and the body is often weighted to ensure the sinking of the body. The Mafia is infamous for disposing of victims in oceans or lakes with their feet cast in a concrete block. Other variants tie concrete blocks or other heavy objects to the victim. The Chicago-style method involves wrapping heavy chains around the victim. In Venice, barrels filled with a human body and concrete are occasionally found in the canals. It is difficult to determine if murder victims buried in a swamp are buried in water or in earth. Often, the body is also cut up to reduce the likelihood of reappearing. In other cases, the victim may have died from an accident, and another involved party tries to destroy evidence of the accident. There are also cases where a stillborn infant is buried to dispose of evidence of infidelity, or problems with fertility, or the shame associated with unwed parenthood in many cultures. Problems While a corpse properly buried at sea is unlikely to reappear, many criminals are unable to ensure the permanent disposals of a body, and evidence of the body may reappear. This is rarely as spectacular as the freshly caught shark in the Sydney Coogee Aquarium that vomited up a surgically separated human arm, leading to a murder investigation. That victim was determined to be James Smith, but the three murder suspects were acquitted. Many criminals dispose of bodies in a river, hoping that the body is carried away. However, this method will most likely lead to a quick detection of the body, because the body gets entangled at the side of the river, or stopped at a dam, or is simply seen floating by others. A disposal in large lakes or oceans is more likely to hide the body, but a decomposing body can develop a strong positive buoyancy due to the decomposing gases being trapped underneath the skin. This may bring the body up to the surface, or at least increase the movement across the ocean floor due to wave actions. Many bodies have washed up at the shore. Bodies have also been discovered in the nets or lines of fishermen, and occasionally, bodies are also discovered by divers.

It was published by Dial Press. Mailer wrote it in serialized form for Esquire, consciously attempting to resurrect the methodology used by Charles Dickens and other earlier novelists, with Mailer writing each chapter against monthly deadlines. The book is written in a poetic style heavy with metaphor that creates unique and hypnotising narrative and dialogue. The novel's action takes place over 32 hours in the life of its protagonist Stephen Rojack. Rojack is a decorated war-hero, former congressman, talk-show host, and university professor. He is depicted as the metaphorical embodiment of the American Dream.  Background  In 1963, Mailer wrote two regular columns: one on religion called \\"Responses and Reactions\\" for Commentary and one called \\"Big Bite\\" for Esquire. Mailer also divorced from his third wife Jeanne Campbell and met Beverly Bentley who would become his fourth wife. Bentley had known Hemingway in Spain and briefly dated Miles Davis in New York before she met Mailer. Bentley and Mailer took a long car trip, notably visited an army buddy \\"Fig\\" Gwaltney in Arkansas, viewed an autopsy of a cancer victim, watched the Sonny Liston and Floyd Patterson fight in Las Vegas, and spent time with the Beats in San Francisco. While in San Francisco, Mailer \\"walked narrow ledges, testing his nerve and balance\\". They spent several days in Georgia with Bentley's family, and returned to New York in August, with Bentley several months pregnant. Mailer officially divorced Campbell, after he and Bentley were married. These experiences, states Lennon, are reflected in An American Dream which Mailer began in September. Mailer's has similarities with Rojack: They both attended Harvard, served in World War II, had an interest in political office, and appeared on talk shows. Mailer seems to have drawn on his stabbing his second wife Adele Morales in Rojack's murdering of his wife Deborah. Mailer did not deny these similarities, but stated: After a cross-country trip and having little success with his \\"big novel\\", Mailer approached the editor of Esquire with an idea that would make him produce a short novel: He would write eight 10,000-word installments that would run from January to August 1964. The editor agreed, and Mailer announced the novel in his last \\"Big Bite\\" column.  Synopsis  In an alcoholic rage, Rojack murders his estranged wife, a high society woman, and descends into a lurid underworld of Manhattan jazz clubs, bars, and Mafia intrigue after meeting Cherry Melanie, a night-club singer and the girlfriend of a highly placed mobster. Rojack makes the death appear as a suicide, and maintains his innocence no matter how intense the scrutiny or severe the consequences. Rojack feels liberated by the violence and imagines himself receiving messages from the moon, perceiving voices that command him to deny his guilt. In the course of the next twenty four hours, Rojack sets his focus against the New York City Police Department, the intimidation of an erratic black entertainer who draws a knife on him, and the gathered political clout of his dead wife's father, Barney Oswald Kelly, who suggests that higher political sources have an interest in Rojack's fate.  Chapter summaries  =The Harbours of the Moon= Rojack vomits over the balcony at a party and considers suicide. He leaves the party and calls his estranged wife Deborah, going to her house after she invites him. Ruta, the maid, lets him in. He notices that Deborah has been drinking. She belittles him in his time of need, and he strangles her on the floor. = A Runner from the Gaming Room = Rojack has sex with Ruta in her room. He then returns to Deborah's room, cleans up the evidence of murder, then throws her over the balcony making her death appear as a suicide. He tells Ruta that Mrs. Rojack killed herself. = A Messenger from the Maniac = Rojack asks Ruta to tell the cops nothing about their encounter. He runs to the street and sees Cherry Melanie, the night club singer, for the first time. He meets Detective Roberts at the scene of the \\"suicide.\\" Depicted is Deborah's body smashed from impact and hit by a car. They go back upstairs, and Rojack fabricates a story about Deborah having cancer as the cause of her suicide. The police insist that Rojack come downtown for questioning. They meet Lt. Leznicki on the way out. Leznicki and O'Brien badger Rojack on the way to the police department. Rojack learns that one of the cars in the pile- up caused by Deborah was Eddie Ganucci, a mob boss wanted on a subpoena. Later Rojack sees Cherry again. He is drawn to her. It turns out that Deborah actually did have cancer so they release Rojack. Rojack goes to the club where Cherry performs in Greenwich Village. = Green Circles of Exhaustion = Rojack sits at the bar drinking and listening to Cherry perform. He joins Cherry and her \\"friends\\" for a drink, verbally sparring with her \\"date\\" Romeo. She and Rojack flirt and kiss; Rojack gets a call from Roberts who warns him to leave. He has an encounter with Tony, who orders Cherry to sing another set. She sings a hymn so Tony fires her. She leaves with Rojack, they get breakfast, and she invites him to a special place. = A Catenary of Manners = The special place is Cherry's post-mortem sister's old apartment. They have sex, and Rojack realizes he has fallen in love with her. He returns to his apartment in the afternoon and talks with Arthur who informs Rojack that Rojack's television show has been cancelled. He then speaks with Dr. Tharchman who tells Rojack that he must take leave from the college. When later talking to Bettina Gigot he picks up on a hint regarding Deborah concerning her father and daughter. Rojack then meets Roberts at the police station who presents him with three pieces of evidence that seem to implicate Rojack. Roberts presses him for a confession. Rojack refuses and is cleared of wrongdoing. Rojack goes back to Cherry and they make love. = A Vision in the Dessert = Rojack and Cherry talk a bit about Rojack's TV show. Then, Cherry tells her life-story: her dead parents; her brother's incest; \\"Daddy Warbucks\\" who turns out to be Kelly; her escape from Vegas; her relationships; her two abortions, one with Kelly and one with a man named Shago; her finally having a vaginal orgasm with Rojack; and her premonition of death soon after. Shago appears at the chapter's end and tells Rojack to leave. = A Votive Is Prepared = Rojack and Shago fight. Rojack gets the upper hand and throws Shago down the stairs. = At the Lion and the Serpent = Rojack goes to the Waldorf Tower to confront Kelly. Rojack talks with Ruta and Deirdre before eating with Kelly. Rojack confesses to the murder of Deborah, then walks the parapet around the roof of the building, hitting Kelly with Shago's umbrella before escaping. He returns to Cherry's only to find out from Roberts she has been killed. = At the Harbors of the Moon Again (Epilogue) = Rojack travels to Las Vegas where he wins big at the tables, paying off all his debts. He imagines speaking with Cherry in Heaven before he heads south to Guatemala and the Yucat√°n.  Style  The style of An American Dream seemed to grow organically from Mailer's \\"Big Bite\\" columns for Esquire. His voice, explains Rollyson, is a \\"supple first-person\\" persona \\"punctuated with feisty asides and comic exaggerations\\". An American Dream is narrated by Steven Richards Rojack, the novel's protagonist, in \\"an edgy, rococo style\\" that shows Mailer at the height of his narrative powers. Andrew Gordon points out that the events of the novel unfold at a quick pace, compared to Mailer's prior works, writing \\"before we are five pages into the novel, Rojack has killed four Germans in a grotesque and graphically violent scene. By the end of thirty pages, Rojack has murdered his wife\\". Gordon finds that Mailer tempers the shock of An American Dream's violence by using a combination of flashback sequences, playful, heavily stylized language, and an abundance of mythical, fairy tale imagery to evoke an exaggerated, dreamlike psychological fantasy. While Kaufmann likens Mailer's narrative to a medieval allegory in its emphasis on magic and metaphysics, Rollyson suggests it embodies an Elizabethan baroqueness and shows Mailer at his best as a novelist. Kaufmann avers that Mailer borrowed his guiding principle from Marx: \\"quantity changes quality\\". Mailer blends modern America with Rojack's dream visions, making his narrative akin to the magician's stage show in writing a \\"novelist as magician who writes a book filled with effects without any causes\\". Even though Mailer himself said he had the intention of writing a realistic novel, his style suggests otherwise. An American Dream is like something out of Chaucer or Dante, or out of American romance, or that the events created by Rojack do not represent literal occurrences that readers come to expect in a novel. Still, argues Merrill, one cannot dismiss Mailer's serious intentions. Barry H. Leeds, in his Enduring Vision of Norman Mailer, suggests two primary structural patterns: one is Rojack's pilgrimage from \\"damnation and madness to salvation and sanity\\" and the other is the geometrical sexual connections shared by the characters.  Analysis  Dearborn calls Rojack the \\"quintessential Mailer hero\\" as he exemplifies many of the traits and accomplishments Mailer himself as a war hero, a successful politician, a television personality, and a professor of \\"existential psychology\\". Mailer commented in a later New York Post interview: \\"I wanted a man who was very much of my generation and generally of my type\\". Rojack feels that his reality is created by the public and that he has become just a shell, a mere actor, which creates a crisis of identity and precipitates his actions. Like Mailer's Hipster, Rojack does not live until he has experienced death ‚Äî so his murder of Deborah frees him from his hollow public life and initiates his transformation. It's only through the lowest and most severe forms of physical transgression that Rojack, like Mailer's Hipster is able to begin his journey toward psychic redemption. Rojack's journey reflects a seminal theme for Mailer in the importance of growth by confronting serious existential situations with courage. In a 1963 letter, Mailer defines what he means by \\"existentialism\\" as \\"that character can dissolve in one stricken event and re-form in startling new fashion\\". Likewise, states Dearborn, Rojack believes that in killing Deborah, he has cured himself of cancer, a theme that becomes explicit in the novel's epilogue where \\"Cancer is the growth of madness denied\\". In a later interview with High Times, Mailer elaborates further noting \\"A lot of people get cancer because they were too responsible with their lives. They led lives that were more responsible then they wanted to be. They lived their lives for others more than for themselves. Denied themselves certain fundamental things, whatever they were. . . . Cancer is a revolution of the cells\\". Leeds adds that, for Mailer, cancer represents moral failure and is a significant theme in much of Mailer's work. It is not easy to accept or to excuse Rojack's ability to escape punishment for his transgression of murder. Often characters cannot so easily get away with murder unless it stems from revenge. Murderer's gambit, whose success requires the approval of the reader, can be applied as a way for the \\"novelist to gamble with the reader's empathy in the hopes of either winning greater sympathy or . . . greater interest in the character's situation\\". Yet, there must contain more strategical tactics in order to win over the jury. For example, when Rojack murders his wife, he compares it to the killing of the Germans. The juxtaposition poses the question of what is the difference between killing a person in wartime and killing a person in society? Mailer also hints that the narrative is \\"framed\\" by a dream cloud through the use of the novel's name An American Dream and the allusion of F. Scott Fitzgerald's story \\"A Diamond as Big as the Ritz\\". An American Dream was controversial for its portrayal and treatment of women, and was critiqued by Kate Millett in Sexual Politics. Millett sees Rojack as another incarnation of a Mailer protagonist who becomes heroic through the linking of sex and violence. Mailer, she argues, attempts to use existentialism to excuse Rojack's misogynistic exploration as his \\"sexistentialist project\\". Rojack's victims are women and a black man, appropriate objects of the white male's \\"dominant wrath\\". Millett chastises Rojack, and by proxy Mailer, for what she assesses as the feigned pretense of radically progressive beliefs that belie his defiant sense of white male privilege, likening him to an old southern Confederate, pretending nobility while lashing out at the encroachment of true progress. Millett notes that \\"Rojack belongs to the oldest ruling class in the world, and like one of Faulkner's ancient retainers of a lost cause, he is making his stand on the preservation of a social hierarchy that sees itself as threatened with extinction. His partial Jewish ancestry and his 'liberal' views to the contrary, Rojack is the last surviving white man as conquering hero\\". Millett criticizes Mailer for being almost wholly unique among prominent authors in championing a character who is a murderer, while allowing the offender to escape any accountability for his crimes: > The humanist convictions which underlie Crime and Punishment (the original > and still the greatest study in what it is like to commit murder), may all > go by the board. Both Dostoyevsky and Dreiser, in An American Tragedy > gradually created in their murderers an acceptance of responsibility for the > violation of life which their actions constituted, and both transcend their > crimes through atonement. Rojack has some singularity in being one of the > first literary characters to get away with murder; he is surely the first > hero as homicide to rejoice in his crime and never really lose his creator's > support. Likewise, Judith Fetterley criticizes Mailer's treatment of women by his male characters in pointing out that each female character must meet a violent death in order for Mailer's hero to be \\"free\\". Although power might lay in the masculine hands of those in government and big business, women have a mystical power over men. This power enacts a control over Rojack and only when Rojack rids himself of Deborah does he feel in possession of himself. American culture, Justin Shaw states, has a tradition in which society expects men to achieve the \\"self-made mode of masculinity\\". Betty Friedan writes in The Feminine Mystique that men, in other words, were not enemies but \\"fellow victims\\" of society's expected and assigned gender roles. His wife's recognition of Rojack in the existing world is shown to have been the link to his masculinity which left him \\"a void where his sense of masculinity resided\\" when she tells him that she no longer loves him. Rojack then begins his search for an active subject role in a masculine role. Maggie McKinley argues that Mailer uses \\"violence as a literary device that facilitates an analysis of his philosophies surrounding existential freedoms, social oppression, and gendered relationships\\". Rojack's violence is not just a result of his masculinity, but from chasing the \\"sexual freedom that is often denied by a repressive or 'cancerous' society\\". Violence provides a centre for Rojack's \\"construction of a liberated masculinity\\": \\"Rojack seems able to discuss manhood only through the language of violence\\", specifically addressing his view that masculinity revolves around either the repression or embrace of violence. Robert Merrill posits that An American Dream seems to suggest violence \\"is not an intolerable aberration but an extreme example of life's essential irrationality\\".  Publication  An American Dream was first published as an eight-part serial in Esquire, January‚ÄìAugust 1964. Mailer announced the serial in his final \\"Big Bite\\" column, making clear that his serial will distinguish itself from other authors. Mailer writes: \\"It's been a long time since anything of this sort has been tried by an author who takes himself seriously\\"; Mailer cited Dickens and Dostoyevsky as inspiration. While the serialization proved a challenge for Mailer he writes that the process \\"has me more or less pissing blood.\\" Esquires circulation increased to 900,000 during the serial's first month. Mailer rewrote 40% of the scenes for the novel's release in book form. Dial Press published the book in hardcover, and Dell published the paperback. The novel was edited for book publication by E.L. Doctorow.  Reception  An American Dream sold well and spent six weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list, reaching number eight in April 1965. The reviews for An American Dream were polarized, with very few mixed. Conventional wisdom was that the novel was one of Mailer's lesser works of fiction. While critics like Granville Hicks, Philip Rahv, Roger Shattuck, Stanley Edgar Hyman, Elizabeth Hardwick, and Tom Wolfe called An American Dream a failure, the novel has strong defenders, notably critics Leo Bersani, Richard Rhodes, Paul Pickrel, Richard Poirier, and Barry H. Leeds. Writing one of the first and most positive reviews in Life, John Aldridge states that An American Dream \\"transcends the conventional limits of blasphemy to expose the struggle toward psychic redemption which is the daily warfare of our hidden outlaw selves\\". Joan Didion writing in Vogue called An American Dream \\"the only serious New York novel since The Great Gatsby\\". Conrad Knickerbocker writes in The New York Times that Mailer \\"is one of the few really interesting writers anywhere\\", and that An American Dream \\"defines the American style by presenting the most extreme of our realities ‚Äî murder, love and spirit strangulated, the corruption of power and the powerful, the sacrifice of self to image, all of it mix mastered in booze and heat-and-serve sex, giving off the smell of burning rubber to the sound of sirens\\". Since 1965, An American Dream has been defended by Mailer's critics, some of which call it one of his better novels. Tony Tanner posits that a few critics likely found An American Dream to be \\"outrageous\\" due to their perception of it as a simple narrative and not as a surrealist work. Tanner hailed Leo Bersani's review of An American Dream as a \\"brilliant comment on the novel as a whole\\" because Bersani recognized the purposeful \\"exuberance\\" that Mailer used. Stanley Edgar Hyman describes An American Dream as a dreadful novel and says it's the worst that he has read in years. He calls the novel pretentious and focuses his critique on what he sees as the flaws in the plot, images, and the tropes. Film adaptation An American Dream was adapted for film in 1966 starring Stuart Whitman as Stephen Rojack, Eleanor Parker as his wife, and Janet Leigh as Cherry McMahon. Johnny Mandel (music) and Paul Francis Webster (lyrics) were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for \\"A Time for Love.\\" The film also is known as See You in Hell, Darling.

Its source is near Laxfield and it reaches a tidal estuary between Southwold and Walberswick on the North Sea coast. Course The course of the river passes through agricultural land between Laxfield and Halesworth, flowing through the estate of Heveningham Hall and the village of Walpole before being crossed by the A144 road and the East Suffolk Line to the south of Halesworth. East of Halesworth the river is canalised in places and has a clear flood plain with land being used as grazing marsh. At Blythburgh it is crossed by the A12 trunk road before entering the estuarine section of the river. The estuary mouth forms the main harbour area of Southwold and is still an active fishing harbour. The estuary is central to the plot of Peter Greenaway's film Drowning by Numbers, being the scene of the final drowning. The river can be crossed by pedestrians by a public footbridge called the Bailey Bridge about a mile upstream from the sea or by the Walberswick rowing boat ferry. Navigation The Blyth Navigation canal was opened in 1761 running from Halesworth to the Blyth estuary, leading to the canalisation of the river east of Halesworth. It was insolvent by 1884, partly due to attempts to reclaim saltings at Blythburgh, which resulted in the estuary silting up and partly due to the opening of the Southwold Railway in 1879. The navigation was used sporadically until 1911, and was not formally abandoned until 1934. History The river gives its name to the settlements of Blyford, indicating a formerly important ford over the river, and Blythburgh.

Life and work Ebertin utilized the research on astrological midpoints of Hamburg School surveyor and astrologer Alfred Witte first published in 1928 in Witte's Regelwerk f√ºr Planetenbilder. Shortly after Witte's death in 1941, Ebertin used Witte's extensive research on astrological midpoints, and a 4th-harmonic \\"90¬∞ dial\\" developed by the Hamburg School of Astrology as the foundations of his School of Cosmobiology. Ebertin continued to promote astrological research, including medical applications of astrology while non-compliant Hamburg School astrologers were interned by the Third Reich, their books and publications banned. Reinhold Ebertin's main reference text on Cosmobiology entitled The Combination of Stellar Influences, sometimes referred to as the 'CSI' or the 'COSI', was inspired by Alfred Witte's Rulebook of Planetary Pictures [Ebertin 1972, p.27 \\"(RPP) appeared to be revolutionary and provoked an unusual and mostly adverse criticism. The author has used that work extensively in his research...\\" followed by critical opinions later challenged by other students of Witte. Ebertin then continues on p.28 \\"Some of Witte's ideas may yet to prove useful, at some future time\\".] . Ebertin's book was first published in 1940 and the most recent updates in the English translation were added in 1972. Ebertin's greatest and most truly original contribution was his research in the field of medical astrology and his addition of more psychological correlations.[(see earlier footnote where Ebertin acknowledged substantial reliance on Witte's RPP as a source: Ebertin 1972, pp.27-28.

Due to Ebertin's work, he is sometimes considered the founder of modern Cosmobiology as the term is generally used today (working largely with the midpoint/dial paradigms of Witte), although the term 'Kosmobiologie' had been previously used by Dr Friedrich Feerhow and Swiss statistician Karl Krafft in a more general sense \\"to designate that branch of astrology working on scientific foundations and keyed to the natural sciences\\".Ebertin 1972, p.11 Family Ebertin's mother, Elsbeth Ebertin, was also an astrologer.

It lies within the civil parish of Templecorran, the historic barony of Belfast Lower, and is part of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council. Before the Plantation of Ulster its name was recorded as both Whitehead and Kinbaine ().Placenames Database of Ireland Located at the base of Muldersleigh Hill, Whitehead lies in a small bay between the limestone cliffs of Whitehead and the black volcanic cliff of Blackhead, with the Blackhead Lighthouse on top, marking the entrance to the Belfast Lough. Whitehead is about from Belfast. On the opposite coast of Belfast Lough, the Copeland Islands, Bangor and part of the County Down coastline, are clearly visible. It had a population of 3,802 in the 2011 Census. Whitehead is notable in that there are no roadways with the suffix \\"Street\\" in their name, giving rise to the nickname 'The Town With No Streets'.  History  In late Victorian and Edwardian times, Whitehead was a popular seaside holiday destination developed by and visitors flocked from Belfast and the surrounding area each year. Whitehead is a Victorian railway village with a well preserved conservation area, including the railway station. It is home to the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland, County Antrim Yacht Club and the Council owned Bentra Golf Course, as well as being the starting point for the popular Gobbins Path. The town also was home to an aerodrome during the First World War which housed two airships. A pioneering Irish railway engineer called Berkeley Deane Wise took this tourism endeavour to the next level, creating innovative new paid-for attractions that would encourage visitors to use the railway company's services. Just south of Gobbins Path, Wise helped transform the tiny hamlet of Whitehead into a premier holiday resort. He designed and built a bandstand, ladies and gents bathing boxes, a ‚Äòchildren‚Äôs corner‚Äô, a slipway and a pavilion with 500 seats. Whitehead received a silver at the Britain in Bloom awards in 2005 & 2006 and a bronze in 2007 with the local Brighter Whitehead group planting many of the flowers. In 2012 Northern Ireland's only Jubilee Wood was planted at Whitehead to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.  Blackhead Coastal Path  The Blackhead Path was built by the Victorians in 1892, partly funded by the railway company, to attract day trippers and holiday makers to Whitehead which was at the time a growing tourist destination and resort. Wise also built a new path Blackhead Path along the coast from Whitehead to the lighthouse at Blackhead, overlooking the town, in 1892. To reach the lighthouse he added several bridges and a tunnel. Wise soon had ambitious plans for a much more elaborate path built on sheer cliffs a few miles to the north: The Gobbins Path was about to be born. This free accessible path is a seaside walk past Sunshine House, around Blackhead Lighthouse and along the Irish Sea cliffs of Islandmagee. In 2018 the pathway was closed due to health & safety issues and a possibility of severe landslip. The Mid and East Antrim Council started a full renovation of the whole path in 2019. The path was reopened in July 2020. Education One primary school exists within the town - Whitehead Primary School. Another school, Lourdes Primary School, operated until June 2011. Whitehead High School, an all-girls secondary school, was present until its closure in 1986. It is now the site of a nursing home.

Members of this family have 2-ranked coriaceous leaves, which, if fresh, typically have a radish-like or peppery taste. The flowers are fasciculate and usually small, and the fruits of these species are a single-seeded drupe crown by the persistent stigmas. This family has its origin in Africa and Malesia. It is the only family outside Brassicales that produces mustard oils. Taxonomy This family was formerly a tribe (Drypeteae) of the subfamily Phyllanthoideae in the Euphorbiaceae. When the Phyllanthoideae was separated to form the new family Phyllanthaceae, it was decided that the former Drypeteae would also stand alone, with the status of a family: Putranjivaceae.

The party emerged from a split in the original Communist Party of Nepal in 1962, representing the pro-Soviet sector of the party. Its main leader until 1983 was Keshar Jung Rayamajhi, who had been the general secretary of the original CPN. In 1966 the group organised a 'Third Central Conference', with delegates from 17 districts. The conference amended the old CPN party constitution, adopting 'National Democracy' as the line of the party. The conference stated that the royal takeover in the country had been a backlash for the democratic forces, and called for a united front to be formed with Nepali Congress. Moreover, the conference made a call for the holding of a party congress.Rawal, Bhim. The Communist Movement in Nepal: Origin and Development. Kathmandu: Accham-Kathmandu Contact Forum, 2007. p. 72-73. In 1967 the group held its 'third congress' in Kathmandu (considering the two first CPN congresses as theirs). The congress elected a 21-member Central Committee and a five-member politburo. The politburo consisted of Keshar Jung Rayamajhi (general secretary), Bishnu Bahadur Manandhar, Krishna Raj Burma, Kamar Shah and Krishna Prasad Shrestha. Manmohan Adhikari and Shambhu Ram Shrestha, both in jail at the time, were nominated to the Central Committee. The congress stated that the Soviet Union was the international centre of socialism, and condemned the positions of China. The congress called for a peaceful political struggle in Nepal, and condemned the idea of armed struggle as 'adventurism'. The congress branded the rival CPN of Tulsi Lal Amatya and Pushpa Lal Shrestha as 'extremist'. When King Birendra declared Nepal as a 'Zone of Peace', the party wholeheartedly supported this move.Rawal, Bhim. The Communist Movement in Nepal: Origin and Development. Kathmandu: Accham- Kathmandu Contact Forum, 2007. p. 158. The party was able to maintain its unity until 1979. However, there were intense debates inside the party on how to relate to the Panchayat system. This dispute intensified in 1976, as the King amended the constitution of the country. In the wake of the people's movement of 1979, sharp differences arouse between Bishnu Bahadur Manandhar and Rayamajhi. Manandhar called for participation in the popular protests against the regime, and accused Rayamajhi of favouring status quo. Manandhar branded Rayamajhi as a 'Royalist', due to his membership in the Raj Sabha appointed by the King. In 1981 the followers of Manandhar, a major section of the party, broke away and formed their own Communist Party of Nepal.Rawal, Bhim. The Communist Movement in Nepal: Origin and Development. Kathmandu: Accham-Kathmandu Contact Forum, 2007. p. 75. After the split, Rayamajhi labelled the dissidents as being under the influence of the CIA.Rawal, Bhim. The Communist Movement in Nepal: Origin and Development. Kathmandu: Accham- Kathmandu Contact Forum, 2007. p. 76. The party led by Rayamajhi contested the 1981 Rastriya Panchayat election, launching over 50 candidates. None of them were elected though.Shaha, Rishikesh. Politics in Nepal 1980-1990. New Delhi: Manohar Publications, 1990. p. 111. Two years after the split, the Rayamajhi- led CPN held its fifth party congress. The congress, attended by 125 delegates from 32 districts, elected Rayamajhi as chairman of the party and Krishna Raj Burma as the new general secretary. Soon after the fifth congress, divisions reappeared inside the party. Again the participation in the Raj Sabha by Rayamajhi and accusations of his workings with the Panchayat system were the focal points of disagreements. In September 1983, Rayamajhi was expelled from the party at a national council meeting. Rayamajhi himself was absent at the meeting as well as a least 13 other members of 35-member national council of the party. Rayamajhi's followers regrouped and formed CPN. After the expulsion of Rayamajhi, the party became known as 'CPN (Burma)' (alternatively 'CPN (Varma)' or 'CPN (Verma)'). After the split, CPN (Burma) reoriented itself towards leftwing unity.Rawal, Bhim. The Communist Movement in Nepal: Origin and Development. Kathmandu: Accham-Kathmandu Contact Forum, 2007. p. 77. The party developed good contacts with the Amatya-led CPN.Rawal, Bhim. The Communist Movement in Nepal: Origin and Development. Kathmandu: Accham- Kathmandu Contact Forum, 2007. p. 135. During the 1990 Jana Andolan (People's Movement), CPN (Burma) formed part of the United Left Front. During the negotiations for starting the rewriting the constitution after the victory of the movement, CPN (Burma) was clearly amongst the most moderate elements inside ULF. When the interim government and the Constitution Recommendations Commission were formed, CPN (Burma) was left out.http://www.uni- bielefeld.de/midea/pdf/harticle4.pdf CPN (Burma) had 35 candidates in the 1991 parliamentary election. It got 16698 votes (0.23%), and no MPs. Burma himself contested the Saptari-5 constituency.http://nepalresearch.org/politics/background/elections_old/election_1991_constituency_results_english.pdf The party had merged itself with the Manadhar and Amatya-led groups to form the Communist Party of Nepal (United) after the 1991 parliamentary election. Soon thereafter, however, Burma split from CPN(United) and re-established his own party. On June 28, 2001 CPN (Burma) merged into the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist). Political analysis CPN (Burma) upheld the line of 'National Democracy Revolution', a programmatic line presented by Nikita Khrushchev in 1956 and adopted by the 1960 International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties in Moscow. The party saw Nepal as a semifeudal and semicolonial country. As of the 1980s, it considered workers, agricultural workers, poor and middle peasants, middle class and intellectuals as friendly classes, and feudalists and capitalists as class enemies. CPN (Burma) considered restoration of democracy, i.e. freedom of speech, press and assembly under multi-party system, as the main task. Regarding chances in the economic structures, the party favoured gradual reform of the economy of the country. The party identified the contradiction between the people and the panchayat system as a direct contradiction, and the contradiction with feudalism as an indirect contradiction. Its programmatic documents did not specify a single main enemy of the party.Rawal, Bhim. The Communist Movement in Nepal: Origin and Development. Kathmandu: Accham-Kathmandu Contact Forum, 2007. p. 123, 126, 141-144, 168. The party proposed peaceful struggles against the panchayat system, discarding the idea of armed struggle against monarchy.Rawal, Bhim. The Communist Movement in Nepal: Origin and Development. Kathmandu: Accham-Kathmandu Contact Forum, 2007. p. 129. Mass organisations The students wing of the party was the Nepal National Students Federation. The Nepal Afro-Asian People's Unity Committee and the Nepal-Soviet Friendship and Cultural Association were linked to the party. The splits in the party affected these structures. NNSF and NAAPUC were divided, whilst the NSFCA remained formally united but the different groups continued to fight over the influence over the organisation.

The force was developed in large measure as a result of efforts by UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld and a proposal and effort from Canadian Minister of External Affairs Lester B. Pearson, who would later win the Nobel Peace Prize for it. The General Assembly had approved a planResolution 1001 (ES-1), 5 November 1956 submitted by the Secretary-General which envisaged the deployment of UNEF on both sides of the armistice line. The Second United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF II) deployed from October 1973 to July 1979.UN.org History =UNEF I= F/L Lynn Garrison crew with UNEF Otter, Sinai, 1962 UNEF Caribou El Arish 1962 Swedish peacekeepers evacuating their position at Hill 88 during the Six-Day War UNEF was the first UN military force of its kind, its mission was to: :... enter Egyptian territory with the consent of the Egyptian Government, in order to help maintain quiet during and after the withdrawal of non-Egyptian forces and to secure compliance with the other terms established in the resolution ... to cover an area extending roughly from the Suez Canal to the Armistice Demarcation Lines established in the Armistice Agreement between Egypt and Israel. UNEF was formed under the authority of the General Assembly and was subject to the national sovereignty clause, Article 2, Paragraph 7, of the U.N. Charter. An agreement between the Egyptian government and the Secretary-General, The Good Faith Accords, or Good Faith Aide-Memoire,Good Faith Aide-Memoire, 11 UN GAOR Annexes, Supp. 16 U.N. Doc. A/3375 (1956) placed the UNEF force in Egypt with the consent of the Egyptian government.The Withdrawal of UNEF and a New Notion of Consent, page 5 Since the operative UN resolutions were not passed under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the planned deployment of a military forces had to be approved by Egypt and Israel. Israel's Prime Minister refused to restore the 1949 armistice lines and stated that under no circumstances would Israel agree to the stationing of UN forces on its territory or in any area it occupied.Eisenhower and Israel: U.S.-Israeli Relations, 1953‚Äì1960, Isaac Alteras, University Press of Florida, 1993, , page 246A Restless Mind: Essays in Honor of Amos Perlmutter, Amos Perlmutter, Benjamin Frankel, Routledge, 1996, , Michael Brecher Essay, page 104-117 After multilateral negotiations with Egypt, eleven countries offered to contribute to a force on the Egyptian side of the armistice line: Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, India, Indonesia, Norway, Sweden, and Yugoslavia. Support was also provided by United States, Italy, and Switzerland. The first forces arrived in Cairo on November 15, and UNEF was at its full force of 6,000 by February 1957. The force was fully deployed in designated areas around the canal, in the Sinai and Gaza when Israel withdrew its last forces from Rafah on March 8, 1957. The UN Secretary-General sought to station UNEF forces on the Israeli side of the 1949 armistice lines, but this was rejected by Israel.Norman G. Finkelstein alludes to Brian Urquhart's memoir, A Life in Peace and War (), where Urquhart, describing the aftermath of the 1956 Suez Crisis, recalls how Israel refused to allow the UNEF to be stationed on the Israeli side of the line, and labels the Israeli rejection as a \\"grave weakness for a peacekeeping force.\\" (Finkelstein 2003:277) The mission was directed to be accomplished in four phases: # In November and December 1956, the force facilitated the orderly transition in the Suez Canal area when British and French forces left. # From December 1956 to March 1957, the force facilitated the separation of Israeli and Egyptian forces and the Israeli evacuation from all areas captured during the war, except Gaza and Sharm-el- Sheik. # In March 1957, the force facilitated the departure of Israeli forces from Gaza and Sharm-el-Sheik. # Deployment along the borders for purposes of observation. This phase ended in May 1967. Due to financial constraints and changing needs, the force shrank through the years to 3,378 by the time its mission ended in May 1967. On 15 May 1967, the Egyptian government ordered all United Nations forces out of Sinai effective immediately. Then Secretary- General U Thant tried to redeploy UNEF to areas within the Israeli side of the 1949 armistice lines to maintain buffer, but this was rejected by Israel.U Thant in his memoir describes how he met permanent representative of Israel to the UN ambassador Gideon Rafael on May 18, 1967 and asked him, \\"in the event of the United Arab Republic's official request for a UNEF withdrawal, if the government of Israel would be agreeable to permit the stationing of UNEF on the Israeli side of the line...\\" The ambassador refused, declaring such a proposal was \\"entirely unacceptable\\" to his government. U Thant later stated that if only Israel had agreed to permit UNEF to be stationed on its side of the border, \\"even for a short duration, the course of history could have been different. Diplomatic efforts to avert the pending catastrophe might have prevailed; war might have been averted.\\" (Thant 1978:223) In a decision that proved to be controversial, Thant acted to effect the Egyptian order without consulting either the Security Council or the General Assembly. Most of the forces were evacuated by the end of May, but 15 UNEF forces were caught in combat operations and killed in the Six-Day War, June 5‚Äì10. The last United Nations soldier left the region on June 17. =UNEF II= An image of Canadian and Panamanian UNEF UN peacekeepers in the Sinai, during 1974. The second United Nations Emergency Forces (UNEF II) was established by United Nations General Assembly, in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 340 (1973), to supervise the ceasefire between Egyptian and Israeli forces at the end of Yom Kippur War or October War, and following of the agreement of 18 January 1974 and 4 September 1975, to supervise the redeployment of Egyptian and Israeli forces and to man and control the buffer zones established under those agreements.UN site The mandate of UNEF II was to supervise the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 340 which demanded that an immediate and complete ceasefire between Egyptian and Israeli forces be observed and that the parties return to the positions they had occupied at 1650 hours GMT on 22 October 1973. The Force would use its best efforts to prevent a recurrence of the fighting, and in the fulfillment of its tasks it would have the cooperation of the military observers of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO). UNEF II was also to cooperate with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in its humanitarian endeavours in the area. The mandate of UNEF II which was originally approved for six months, until 24 April 1974, was subsequently renewed eight times. Each time, as the date of expiry of the mandate approached, the Secretary-General submitted a report to the United Nations Security Council on the activities of the Force during the period of the mandate. In each of those reports, the Secretary-General expressed the view that the continued presence of UNEF II in the area was essential, and he recommended, after consultations with the parties, that its mandate be extended for a further period. In each case, the Council took note of the Secretary-General's report and decided to extend the mandate of the Force accordingly. In October 1978, the mandate of UNEF II was extended a last time for nine months, until 24 July 1979.UNEF II mandate The area of operation of the UNEF II was at Suez Canal sector and later the Sinai peninsula, with the headquarters located at Cairo (October 1973 to August 1974) and Ismailia (August 1974 ‚Äì July 1979).United Nations Department of Public Information: Middle East ‚Äì UNEF II The deployment of forces as of July 1979 was as follows: *Buffer zone 1 (boundary: Mediterranean Sea, line J, line M and line E) Swedbatt (Swedish battalion) Ghanbatt (Ghanaian battalion) Indbatt (Indonesian battalion) *Bufferzone 2A (boundary: Bufferzone 1, line M, bufferzone 2B, and Gulf of Suez) Indbatt (Indonesian battalion) Finbatt (Finnish battalion) *Bufferzone 2B (boundary: bufferzone 2A, line M, Gulf of Suez) Finbatt (Finnish battalion)The Blue Helmet, A Review of United Nations Peace-Keeping, United Nations Publication, second edition, 1990, pp 423. .

The Lubomirski family's coat of arms is the Dru≈ºyna coat of arms, which is similar to the Szreniawa coat of arms but without a cross.  Origin and the coat of arms  The Lubomirski family have been actors in the history of Poland since the 10th century. There are two theories regarding the family's origin. One, by Adam Boniecki, a Polish heraldist, assumes that there were two branches of the family. One settled at the Szreniawa River in Proszowice County while the other established itself in Szczyrzyc County. The time of this division of the family is not known, but most likely it was before the adoption of Christianity by Poland. The Szreniawici family used a similar coat of arms, which means that the two families had the same ancestry. At the time of Mieszko I, the members of the Lubomirski family demonstrated bravery in battle against pagans. For this they were awarded the rank of knight and a coat of arms, which depicts bends of the Szreniawa River in the form of a letter S of white colour on a red background, instead of the Szreniawici cross, with the motto Patriam Versus (Turned to the Homeland). This coat of arms has been used by the representatives of the family to the present time.A. Boniecki, A. Reiski, herbarz polski, part 1, Wiadomo≈õci historyczno-genealogiczne o rodach szlacheckich, v. 15, Gebethner i Wolf, Warsaw 1912, p. 56 ‚Äì 57. The author of the second theory of the family's origins is the medievalist W≈Çadys≈Çaw Semkowicz. In his article \\"The fellowship and ≈öreniawa. Heraldic study\\" (‚ÄûDru≈ºyna i ≈öreniawa. Studyum heraldyczne‚Äù) he writes that the family used to live on the banks of the Szreniawa River in Szczyrzycki poviat (county), in the area surrounded by the Raba and Stradomka rivers, the Trzcia≈Ñski brook, and the ≈Åososina and Krzyworzeka streams. Semkowicz says that the original territory of the Dru≈ºynnici family (ancestors of the Lubomirski, Wieruski, Rupniewski, and Lasocki families) was located there. Semkowicz says that the coat of arms does not show bends of a river, but a curved rod ‚Äì a sign of episcopal or secular power, signifying that for many centuries before the adoption of the name, the family had exercised significant power. This theory assumes, in its later part, that, in the 15th century, the Polish chronicler Jan D≈Çugosz incorrectly ascribed the origin of the coat of arms of the fellowship (Szreniawa without a cross), and other heraldists accepted this view.W. Semkowicz, Dru≈ºyna i ≈öreniawa. Studyum heraldyczne, ‚ÄûKwartalnik Historyczny‚Äù, R. 14 (1900), pp. 200 ‚Äì 222 The history of the Szreniawici, or Dru≈ºynnici, family is closely linked with the rulers of the Piast dynasty. One of the Szreniawici was a canon at the Wawel court, and people using this coat of arms belonged to the inner circle of Boles≈Çaw ≈ömia≈Çy, according to Jan D≈Çugosz, in Annals or Chronicles of the Famous Kingdom of Poland (Roczniki czyli Kronikis≈Çawnego Kr√≥lestwa Polskiego). The oldest document mentioning the Lubomirski family comes from the 11th century. It is in the property section of the Crown Register of 1682 in Krak√≥w. The original no longer exists. There is only a mention in the register under a given year.A. Boniecki, A. Reiski, Herbarz polski, part 1, Wiadomo≈õci historyczno-genealogiczne o rodach szlacheckich, v. 15, Gebethner i Wolf, Warsaw 1912, 56 ‚Äì 58. However, the authors of Herbarz argue that this document was a forgery. Successive members of the family took up positions of bishops, for example, Piotr, Archbishop of Gniezno mediated between the princes of the Piast dynasty during the congress in ≈Åƒôczyca in 1180.K. Niecsiecki S. J. Herbarz polski powiƒôkszony dodatkami z p√≥≈∫niejszych autor√≥w, rƒôkopis√≥w, dowod√≥w urzƒôdowych, v. 8, Breitkopf w Haertel, Lipsk 1841, p. 469 ‚Äì 472. The family performed important functions at the court of the Piast dynasty and extended their estates through investing in land, mainly within the territory of the Ma≈Çopolska province. Jakub Lubomirski served as a borough writer in the 14th century.  Foundations of economic power  Piotr (d. 1480), the heir of Lubomierz, the territorial designation that is the basis of the family name, is regarded as the progenitor of the Lubomirski family. The economic foundation of the family rested on the exploitation of salt mines in Krak√≥w province, the mineshafts being leased from rulers of Poland. The Lubomirski family also established private mines in Ma≈Çopolska province. Sebastian (c. 1546 ‚Äì 1613), who in 1581 became a mine administrator of Krak√≥w, was the creator of this economic power. This was the first administrative position in the capital city occupied by a member of the family. While taking up his duties, Sebastian had the support of Stefan Batory. In 1595, Sebastian received the title of Count of Wi≈õnicz from the Emperor Rudolf II; in 1591, he entered the Senate as governor of Ma≈Çogoszcz. He opened a private salt mine shaft \\"Kunegunda\\" in Siercza, which was exploited for about 100 years.T. Zieli≈Ñska, Poczet polskich rod√≥w arystokratycznych, WSiP, Warsaw 1997, p. 134. Money gained from the salt trade allowed the Lubomirski family to lend money to even the wealthiest people in the country. This enabled them to purchase properties or take them over from insolvent debtors. The family built up its economic position over many generations, accumulating assets that they held for centuries.Rody magnackie Rzeczypospolitej, PWN, Warsaw 2009, p. 98.  Residences  The first mentions of the home in Lubomierz were recorded in 1398.A. Boniecki, A. Reiski, Herbarz polski, part 1, Wiadomo≈õci historyczno- genealogiczne o rodach szlacheckich, v. 15, Gebethner i Wolf, Warsaw 1912, 56 ‚Äì 58. The number of family estates, starting with Gd√≥w and Szczyrzyca which the family also possessed in the 13th century, increased significantly. In the 17th and 18th centuries they were located in Lubomierz, Nowy Wi≈õnicz, Bochnia, Wieliczka, ≈Åa≈Ñcut, Baran√≥w Sandomierski, Pu≈Çawy, Rzesz√≥w, R√≥wne, Tarn√≥w, Jaros≈Çaw, Przeworsk, and Janowiec upon the Vistula, among others. To this day, the castle in Nowy Wi≈õnicz has been the property of the Family Association of the Princes Lubomirski.District Court in Bochnia, Division of the Land Registry Office, LWH 390. Many estates were located in the territories of the largest Polish cities: Warsaw (e.g. Mokot√≥w, Ujazd√≥w, Czerniak√≥w), Krak√≥w (Wola Justowska, Kamienica Pod Baranami), Rzesz√≥w (castle), Sandomierz, and Lvov. Maintaining foreign residences in Drezno, Vienna, and Paris enhanced family prestige. The members of the family were referred to as \\"the owners of the bank of the Dnieper River\\" because many of their estates were located in what is now Ukraine and Slovakia. The Lubomirski family enjoyed political, military, and economic influence, which was concentrated in the provinces of Krak√≥w, Sandomierz, Stanis≈Çaw√≥w, and Ruthenia, to eventually cover the whole area of the Commonwealth of the Two Nations. They kept this state of ownership until the collapse of the Polish state, when they were deprived of many estates as a result of penalties for pro-independence activities. The Lubomirski family looked to invest by buying large estate complexes. They consciously strived to gather them into one contiguous whole. Territorial expansion began in the ancestral territory located south of Krak√≥w and was directed toward the east. The combined estates reached their largest size at the time of Stanis≈Çaw (d. 1649). It was the third largest holding in the Republic of Poland, only smaller than the entail of Ostr√≥g and the estates of the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family. In addition to purchasing properties, the Lubomirski family leased rich royal estates, such as the Starosties of Spisz, Sandomierz, and SƒÖcz. Income from the land leased from the king was comparable to that from private estates. The family introduced several innovative facilities and processes to their estates. Their arable farms adopted methods of industrial production; sugar factories, distilleries, and factories were built. They also introduced enlightened social practices, such as granting equal rights for subjects, allowing Jews to buy properties in private towns and to build houses, and vesting them with judicial powers.Jerzy Sebastian was particularly involved in the activities of democratization. He believed that the increase in economic rights of all his subjects would make him get richer, too. Schools and hospitals for the peasant population were founded, which were maintained with private family income. The family estates often hired people from the lowest class, caring about their education, offering a place of residence, clothing, and a salary paid twice a year. For faithful service, workers were given ownership of land in perpetual or inheritable possession.K. Niesiecki, Herbarz polski powiƒôkszony dodatkami z p√≥≈∫niejszych autor√≥w, rƒôkopis√≥w, dowod√≥w urzƒôdowych i wydany przez J. N. Borowicza, v. 6, Lipsk 1841, p. 147.  Division  The family, originally small in number, grew considerably, which led to divisions of material wealth but enhanced political influence, due to having the support of more people in the Sejms, in the Senate, or at the royal court. Members of the family were able to count on the support of their relatives in political or court activities. The family split into five major lineages: of Wi≈õnicz (from Aleksander Micha≈Ç, 1614 ‚Äì 1677), ≈Åa≈Ñcut (from Stanis≈Çaw Herakliusz, 1642 ‚Äì 1702), Przeworsk (from Aleksander Micha≈Ç, ‚Äì d. 1675), Rzesz√≥w (from Hieronim Augustyn, c. 1647 ‚Äì 1706), and Janowiec (from Jerzy Dominik, 1665 ‚Äì 1727). The most numerous was that of Przeworsk, which was further divided into three branches: dubrowie≈Ñsko-kruszy≈Ñska, r√≥wnie≈Ñsko- przeworska, and dubie≈Ñska. Many members of this line are alive now.  First citizens of Poland  The members of the family served the state as marshals, starosts, governors, and hetmans. Four of the princes Lubomirski held the office of Grand Marshal of the Crown: Jerzy Sebastian, J√≥zef Karol, Stanis≈Çaw Herakliusz and Stanis≈Çaw. They were active in the politics, chairing the Sejms, forming a private army, representing the king at the courts Europe. Many times they had a decisive influence on the choice of monarchs. They were defenders of the nobility, who often entrusted the family with their proxy vote at the Sejms and in the election of kings. Although Jerzy Sebastian was Grand Marshal and Field Hetman of the Crown, he supported the nobility in rebellion.J. D≈Çugosz, latyfundia Lubomirskich w XVII wieku (powstanie ‚Äì rozw√≥j ‚Äì podzia≈Çy), Opole University, Opole 1997, p. 13 Marriages were also important. Members of the Lubomirski family became linked with equally powerful and wealthy families. It enabled them to extend their private estates, and even take over a part of the estate of Ostr√≥g under the Kolbuszowa transaction of 1753. Stanis≈Çaw Lubomirski (1583 ‚Äì 1649) married Zofia Ostrogska; Aleksander Micha≈Ç Lubomirski married Helena Tekla Ossoli≈Ñska; Krystyna Lubomirska married Albrycht Stanis≈Çaw Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. J√≥zef Karol (1638 ‚Äì 1702) was Teofilia Ludwika Zas≈Çawska‚Äôs husband; Teresa Lubomirska (d. 1712) married Karol Filip, the Prince of Neuburg, and Marianna Lubomirska (1693 ‚Äì 1729) married Pawe≈Ç Karol Sanguszko, the Grand Marshal of Lithuania.Rody magnackie Rzeczypospolitej, PWN, Warsaw 2009, p. 103, T. Zieli≈Ñska, Poczet polskich rod√≥w arystokratycznych, WSiP, Warsaw 1997, p. 137.  Royal blood  In 1647, Stanis≈Çaw Lubomirski received the hereditary title of Prince of the Holy Roman Empire from Emperor Ferdinand III. The Lubomirski family itself was a candidate for Poland's crown. Grand Hetman of the Crown Prince Hieronim Augustyn was the most serious candidate for the Polish crown after the death of John III Sobieski. Prince Teodor Konstanty (1683-1745), governor of Krak√≥w, submitted his candidacy for the Crown after the death of Augustus II the Strong. Prince Stanis≈Çaw Lubomirski, governor of Kiev and Speaker of the Radom treasury tribunal, campaigned for the throne in 1764. Lubomirski princes were also candidates for the Czech and Hungarian crowns; Jerzy Ignacy Lubomirski (1687-1753) sought the throne of Hungary. The culmination of these efforts was Zdzislaw Lubomirski's serving as Prince Regent from 1917 to 1918.Elekcje kr√≥l√≥w Polski w Warszawie na Woli 1575-1764.

The Lubomirski family was related to almost all the dynasties ruling in Europe, the Capetien, Bourbon, Liudolfing, Wittelsbach, Hohenzollern, and Rurykowicz dynasties. The family is maternally related to the Piast of Masovia family. Zofia Lubomirska was the great-granddaughter of Anna Lubomirska, the daughter of Konrad III Rudy, the prince of Mazovia. Katarzyna Lubomirska (c. 1585 ‚Äì 1620) was the wife of Konstanty Bazyli II, Prince of Ostr√≥g, who was closely related to Boles≈Çaw IV, a descendant of Konrad Mazowiecki.wielcy.pl, Wielka genealogia Minakowskiego.  Military exploits  Prince Stanis≈Çaw Lubomirski was famous for commanding at the Battle of Chocim in 1621, fought against Turkish-Tatar forces. Stanis≈Çaw initially took part in the battle at the head of a private regiment, but when hetman Karol Chodkiewicz died, and hetman Koniecpolski was taken captive, Stanis≈Çaw took command and ended the multi-day battle quickly, with the Turks being repelled on October 10, 1621. Prince Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski (1616 ‚Äì 1667) was the only Polish aristocrat during the Deluge to not take the oath to Charles X Gustav. Jerzy gave shelter to Jan Kazimierz on his estate in Lubowla (today‚Äôs Slovakia) and launched a counteroffensive of Polish troops. He lent his private army, which fought the Battle of Warka, and recaptured Warsaw and Toru≈Ñ, which had been occupied by the Swedes. Stefan Czarniecki supported the campaign. In 1660, at the head of private and royal armies, Prince Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski conducted a lightning campaign that ended with the defeat of Russian forces at Cudn√≥w and Po≈Çonka. In 1661, a worsening of relations with the king resulted in rebellion. The prince withdrew to Silesia; and, degraded by the Sejm court, fought for his political rehabilitation. His sons succeeded in this matter. Prince Hieronim Augustyn, a member of the Order of Hospitallers, devoted his life to fighting the Turks, who were considered a cultural threat to European civilization. He defeated Piotr Doroszenko in the Cossack uprising. In 1670, he fought against the Crimean Horde at Brac≈Çaw and . In 1683, during the Battle of Vienna, his troops were the first to reach the city gates. During the period of the first Republic of Poland, eight members of the family served as generals. Two of them took part in the war with Czarist Russia, which gave rise to the Ko≈õciuszko Insurrection.T. M. Nowak, Historia orƒô≈ºa polskiego 963 ‚Äì 1795, Wiedza Powszechna, Warsaw 1988, pass.  Lubomirski family in the history of Warsaw  To build his numerous residences, Prince Stanis≈Çaw Herakliusz Lubomirski (1642 ‚Äì 1702) hired Tylman of Gameren, later court architect to King Micha≈Ç Korybut Wi≈õniowiecki. Stanis≈Çaw Lubomirski owned residences in Pu≈Çawy, Czerniak√≥w, (where he founded a monastery and church of the Bernardines), and in Ujazd√≥w (now part of Warsaw), where, at the end of the 17th century, he built a bathhouse that became the Palace on the Water of Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, and the Ermitage, which was planned as a place of meditation and relaxation. Stanis≈Çaw Herakliusz was a friend of many European artists and patrons of the arts, as evidenced by correspondence. He had relations with the French and Spanish courts, as well as members of the Medici family. These facilitated his carrying out a number of missions and negotiations on behalf of the Polish king. Stanis≈Çaw Herakliusz was a talented author, a precursor of the Polish Baroque in literature. He spoke several languages and made use almost all known literary forms in his works. However, he was interested mostly in the new trends coming from Italy. His philosophical work \\"Dialogues of Artakses and Ewander\\" entered the canon of the Old Polish Literature and became required reading.S. Mossakowski, Mecenat artystyczny Stanis≈Çawa Herakliusza Lubomirskiego, [w:] Stanis≈Çaw Herakliusz Lubomirskie. Pisarz ‚Äì polityk ‚Äì mecenas, edited by W. Roszkowska, Ossolineum, Wroc≈Çaw 1982, p. 51 ‚Äì 75. An example of building in the very centre of Warsaw is a reconstruction of the Copper-Roof Palace (Pa≈Çac Pod BlachƒÖ), commissioned in the early 18th century by Jerzy Dominik Lubomirski. The palace, classical in form and situated on the south side of the Royal Castle, was bought by the king himself, in 1777, who later added the library.M. M. Drozdowski, A. Zahorski, Historia Warszawy, Jeden ≈öwiat, Warsaw 2004, p. 120 ‚Äì 121. The previous owner of this building was Prince Jerzy Marcin Lubomirski (1738 ‚Äì 1811), distinguished in service to the Polish theatre. He financed exhibitions of family and European art and organized numerous concerts, balls, and meetings. Celebrations organized by him were a meeting place for artists and aristocrats from across Europe, while in local memory he was remembered as an organizer of public events with fireworks displays.Encyklopedia Warszawy, red. B. Petrozolin ‚Äì Skowro≈Ñska, PWN, Warsaw 1994, p. 231. Prince Jerzy Marcin was also an adventurer and a member of the Bar Confederation. From 1758, he served in the Prussian and Russian armies. He was barred from political life in Poland by his family, but he went down in history as a lover of music and theatre. In 1777, he financed a production of Tartuffe by Moli√®re; in 1783 leased the privilege of the theatre and made Wojciech Bogus≈Çawski its director. He also opened a ballet drama school for 1000 people.T. Zieli≈Ñska, Poczet polskich rod√≥w arystokratycznych, WSiP, Warsaw 1997, p. 143 ‚Äì 144. Prince Stanis≈Çaw Lubomirski went down in history as an administrator of Warsaw. He introduced permanent street lighting and supported a police unit with his private money. Above all, he wished to care for the health of the Varsovians, wherefore he decided to surround the city, on both sides of the Vistula, with an earthen embankment, initially to protect against the spreading plague epidemic. There were only three crossings in the embankment, by which traffic in and out of the city was controlled. Later, the embankment, reinforced with guns, was used to defend the capital during the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising and the November Uprising. Throughout the 19th century, the embankment marked the boundary of the city. By the Act of 1770, Stanis≈Çaw introduced permanent street names, which greatly facilitated the administration of the city and its functioning, especially facilitating registration and correspondence.M. M. Drozdowski, A. Zahorski, Historia Warszawy, Jeden ≈öwiat, Warsaw 2004, p. pass. Izabela Lubomirska (1736 ‚Äì 1816), the wife of Stanis≈Çaw, rebuilt the ≈Åa≈Ñcut Castle and collected art and books from around the world. She was politically active; during the revolution, she sheltered part of the French court at her estate in ≈Åa≈Ñcut. She extended her residences, often employing the latest architectural solutions. She built a palace on her estate in Mokot√≥w, the district of Warsaw that gets its name from her estate, Mon Coteau (My Hill). She was a lover of theatre and laid the foundation stone of the National Theatre in Warsaw, as well as maintaining a number of theatres in her palaces. The notion of theatre then had a much broader meaning than now. It included not only the theatre performances, but also opera, cabaret, and acrobatic performances. For her, Franciszek Karpi≈Ñski wrote the \\"Song about the Lord‚Äôs birth\\", better known under the title \\"God is born\\". In honour of her daughter, Cyprian Kamil Norwid wrote a panegyric. Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko set out from the residence in ≈Åa≈Ñcut, to Krak√≥w, when he incited the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising.B. Majewska ‚Äì Maszkowska, Mecenat artystyczny Izabeli z Czartoryskich Lubomirskiej (1746 ‚Äì 1816), Ossolineum, Wroc≈Çaw 1976, p. 17 ‚Äì 96.  Philanthropists and patrons  The Lubomirski family, like other affluent aristocratic families, engaged in artistic, cultural, and scientific patronage. At Wi≈õnicz, Wilan√≥w, the Royal Baths, ≈Åa≈Ñcut, or Mokot√≥w, they supported private theatre groups, financed artists, funded religious buildings, and maintained their residences. The reconstruction of Wi≈õnicz castle was planned by architect Maciej Trapola, the castle chapel being decorated with stucco by Giovanni Battista Falconi and wherein Stanis≈Çaw Lubomirski, who financed the renovation of the castle, installed twenty sacred objects.P. S. Szlezynger, Fundacje architektoniczne Stanis≈Çawa Lubomirskiego wojewody i starosty generalnego krakowskiego, Cracow University of Technology, Krak√≥w 1994, p. 10 ‚Äì 27. Marceli Lubomirski for many years supported the work of poet Cyprian Kamil Norwid. He was immortalized by the poet in the book White Flowers.C. K. Norwid, Bia≈Çe kwiaty, ed. 3, reviewed and supplemented. PIW, Warsaw 1977, pass. J√≥zef Lubomirski (1751 ‚Äì 1817) was a promoter of industrialization and reforms, a capable military commander, and a knight of the Order of White Eagle and the Order of Saint Stanislaus. He supported the Constitution of May 3, 1791.A. Przybo≈õ, Lubomirski J√≥zef, [w:] Polski S≈Çownik Biograficzny, ed. E. Rostworowski, v. 18, PWN, Warsaw 1973, p. 26 ‚Äì 27. The Lubomirski family built private schools for pupils on their estates. They often put schooling in the hands of professionals ‚Äì the Order of Piarists and the Order of Jesuits. The members of the family founded monasteries, churches, and other religious buildings. Stanis≈Çaw Lubomirski founded the Carmelite Monastery in Wi≈õnicz, which is still the pearl of Renaissance architecture in Poland. For many decades, residents of the castle in Wi≈õnicz contributed various legacies to the monastery. Jerzy Dominik Lubomirski (c. 1665 ‚Äì 1727) gave to the Pauline Monastery at Jasna G√≥ra many valuable objects, including the sacred vessels. It was on his initiative to build the main gate leading to the Monastery. The gate is called the Gate of the Lubomirski Family.http://czestochowa.miasto.biz, downloaded on 18.10.2011.  Under partition  After 1795, the princes Lubomirski engaged in clandestine and insurgent activities against the occupying Russians; and, in consequence, they lost estates. Prince Jerzy Roman Lubomirski (1799 ‚Äì 1865), the owner of Rozwad√≥w, participated in the battles of the November and January uprisings and organized hospitals for the wounded on his estates. After the collapse of the uprising, his palace became a place where secret meetings of Polish patriots were held. Jerzy was active in social and scientific fields, maintaining a grammar school and poorhouse for the poor and establishing two scientific foundations, one funding the scientific testing of equipment, the other rewarding Polish authors of outstanding scientific works. His brother Adam Hieronim Karol Lubomirski (1811 ‚Äì 1873) was awarded the Virtuti Militari cross, for participating in the November Uprising. In 1883, Prince Henryk Lubomirski (1777‚Äì1850) gave his rich collection of books, archive material, works of art, and other antiques to the Ossoli≈Ñski National Institute in Lvov, which since has become an important scientific and cultural institution, with its 19th-century publications, on the humanities research conducted there, being still considered of value. Without the material and financial support of Henryk, the facility would have closed at an early stage of activity. Henryk for many years served as a curator of the facility. He also contributed to the formation of the Museum of the Princes Lubomirski, the first private museum in the Polish land generally available to the public. He was on familiar terms with poet Zygmunt Krasi≈Ñski, who memorialized the prince in his Non-Divine Comedy, in the person of Orcio. Downloaded on 18.10.2011. The name Orcio derives from French Henry (read Auri). In 1823, Henryk created the entail of Przeworsk; but, as a result of his subversive activities, the entail was legalized by the partitioning authorities only after his death. In 1869, his son Prince Andrzej Lubomirski became the first recognized entailer. Prince Aleksander Lubomirski (1802 - 1893) founded centres for poor boys (at today's seat of the University of Economics) and girls (in ≈Åagiewniki) in the centre of Krak√≥w. At these centres, young poor were prepared for adult life, being instructed for free in practical professions that could be the basis for future employment.J. Bieniarz√≥wna, Lubomirski Aleksander Ignacy [w:] Polski S≈Çownik Biograficzny, ed. E. Roztworowski, v. 18 PWN, Warsaw 1973, p. 2. Prince Jan Tadeusz Lubomirski (1826 ‚Äì 1908) founded the Warsaw Charity Society. He was the long-standing president of the Ophthalmology Institute in Warsaw, which conducted ophthalmology research according to European standards. On his initiative, special teams were set up which helped poor people to get free eye care. During the January Uprising the prince was a member of the National Government of Romuald Traugutt, where he served as a head of the Department of Internal Affairs. For anti-Tsarist activities, he was exiled deep into Russia, to Nizhny Novgorod. He supported Polish education. He protected Polish vocational organizations from competition from Russian and Prussian ones and established credit unions. He tried to regain possession of Polish art stolen by the Russians; and among others, he helped to reconstruct the Poniatowski monument standing in front of the Presidential Palace. He also restored and renovated the Zygmunt's Column, and bought Polish castles in Czersk and I≈Ç≈ºa, in order to save them from being demolished. In 1875, he established the Museum of Industry and Agriculture in Warsaw. He established evening schools for craftsmen and journeymen as well as penny- saving banks for the poor. He financed the publishing of sources important in the history of Poland, as well as professional magazines. He organized free libraries.W. H. Melanowski, Dzieje Instytutu Oftalmicznego im.

W≈Çadys≈Çaw Emanuel Lubomirski supported the Zoological Cabinet of the University of Warsaw, helping to purchase teaching aids and financing travel by employees of the university. He donated his collection of shells. He was interested in floristics and studied the behavior of plants in the changed climate conditions.

To facilitate the operation of the organization, he founded a company that promoted talented young Polish artists. He supported music education. He helped to promote Karol Szymanowski, Artur Rubinstein, and Grzegorz Fitelberg. He helped to protect the Warsaw Philharmonic from closure by Tsarist officials.H.

Independent Poland  On 7 of October 1918, after 123 years under the third partition, on the initiative of Prince Regent Zdzis≈Çaw Lubomirski (1865 ‚Äì 1943), Polish independence was proclaimed and published in the Monitor Polski.Monitor Polski Special supplement of. 7.10.1918, no. 168, p. 1. Zdzis≈Çaw was a politician, president of the Civic Committee, and the president of Warsaw. He extended self-government, organized intervention works, credit unions, and cared for the education and living conditions of the Varsovians. His activities mapped out the direction that future politicians of the independent state would follow. In 1926, he undertook the role of mediator between the parties to the May coup. In the 1930s, he was a senator on the foreign affairs and military committees. During World War II he was imprisoned and tortured by the Gestapo. He died of wounds sustained in prison.L.

Interwar period  In the years 1919 ‚Äì 1939, princes Lubomirski served as Members of Parliament, senators, and in the ministries. They were also engaged in the industrialization of the country. They belonged to the key organizations involved in the modernization of roads, railways, and aviation. They took part in the reconstruction of the Polish army. They formed banking centres and credit unions, which provided cheap loans to the poorest, and were active in educational organizations, financing schools, as well as being engaged in Polish culture. Prince Stefan Lubomirski (1862 ‚Äì 1941) was a founder of the Polish Olympic Games Committee (later the Polish Olympic committee, PKOL), becoming its first president (its next president being his cousin, Prince Kazimierz Lubomirski), and a member of the International Olympic Committee. Prince Stefan was passionate about racehorse breeding, forming with his brothers the most modern horse-breeding farm in Poland at Widz√≥w manor near Czƒôstochowa. Stefan was the owner of the Warsaw Commuter Railways (Warszawska Kolej Dojazdowa) company, which created the narrow gauge passenger and freight railways of Gr√≥jec, Jab≈Çonk√≥w, and Wilan√≥w. Railways allowed capital city dwellers to reach factories located outside the city and residents of suburban areas to get to the capital city. During World War II, the railways built by Lubomirski delivered supplies to the occupied city and brought employees to Warsaw offices and factories.B.

Prince Stanis≈Çaw Sebastian Lubomirski established the central union of Polish industry Leviatan, where he was the president from 1932. The union promoted the ideas of development of industry ‚Äì lowering taxes, social security benefits for workers, and increasing state aid to industry. Members of the organization were elected to the Sejm, the Senate, were members of governments of the Second Republic of Poland, and served other state institutions. They published three magazines: Economic Review (PrzeglƒÖd Gospodarczy), The Polish Courier (Kurier Polski), and The Telegram (Depesza). Stanis≈Çaw Sebastian established the Industrial Bank of Warsaw SA (Bank Przemys≈Çowy Warszawski S.A.) and was the president of the Commercial Bank (Bank Handlowy) in Warsaw, the Central Union of Polish Industry (Centralny ZwiƒÖzek Przemys≈Çu Polskiego), the Polish Bank Association (ZwiƒÖzek Bank√≥w Polskich), and the Association of Polish Industrialists (Stowarzyszenie Przemys≈Çowc√≥w Polskich). He devoted his life to the struggle for the independence of the Polish economy from the influence of the partitioners, and, after regaining independence, from that of neighbouring countries.Z.

For keeping a secret storehouse of medicines for the Home Army, he was arrested and detained in prison in Montelupich. He was on the list to be shot but escaped to Krak√≥w, where he was hidden. The Germans set the date for the transportation of his family to the concentration camp near O≈õwiƒôcim. Downloaded on 18.10.2011. Prince Eugeniusz Lubomirski (1895 ‚Äì 1982) was arrested by the NKVD and put in the Lubyanka Prison, where he met General Anders, later becoming the general's adjutant, fighting at the general's side throughout Europe. He eventually reached the United Kingdom and was a candidate for President of Poland in Exile.E. Lubomirski, Kartki z ≈ºycia mego, Polska Fundacja Kulturalna, London, 1982, pass. Prince Hieronim Lubomirski was killed at the age of 17, during the rescue of prisoners in Pawiak code-named Action \\"Pawiak\\" (\\"Akcja Pawiak\\"). On July 19‚Äì20, 1944, a Ukrainian Wachmeister (guard) Petrenko, and some prisoners attempted a mass jailbreak, supported by an attack from the outside, but failed. Petrenko and several others committed suicide. The Resistance attack detachment was ambushed and suffered very heavy casualties, practically ceasing to exist. In reprisal, over 380 prisoners were executed the next day. Prince Jerzy Ignacy Lubomirski (1882 ‚Äì 1945) was active in the local community. He travelled to Vienna to discuss the construction of the bridge over the San River. He helped people particularly affected during the war. He was arrested in 1944 and detained and tortured in Tarnobrzeg prison. He was murdered by the Secret Police (UrzƒÖd Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa) as a member of the Home Army. Downloaded on 18.10.2011.

Two regression lines (red) bound the range of linear regression possibilities. The shallow slope is obtained when the independent variable (or predictor) is on the abscissa (x-axis). The steeper slope is obtained when the independent variable is on the ordinate (y-axis). By convention, with the independent variable on the x-axis, the shallower slope is obtained. Green reference lines are averages within arbitrary bins along each axis. Note that the steeper green and red regression estimates are more consistent with smaller errors in the y-axis variable. Regression dilution, also known as regression attenuation, is the biasing of the regression slope towards zero (the underestimation of its absolute value), caused by errors in the independent variable. Consider fitting a straight line for the relationship of an outcome variable y to a predictor variable x, and estimating the slope of the line. Statistical variability, measurement error or random noise in the y variable causes uncertainty in the estimated slope, but not bias: on average, the procedure calculates the right slope. However, variability, measurement error or random noise in the x variable causes bias in the estimated slope (as well as imprecision). The greater the variance in the x measurement, the closer the estimated slope must approach zero instead of the true value. Suppose the green and blue data points capture the same data, but with errors (either +1 or -1 on x-axis) for the green points. Minimizing error on the y-axis leads to a smaller slope for the green points, even if they are just a noisy version of the same data. It may seem counter-intuitive that noise in the predictor variable x induces a bias, but noise in the outcome variable y does not. Recall that linear regression is not symmetric: the line of best fit for predicting y from x (the usual linear regression) is not the same as the line of best fit for predicting x from y. How to correct for regression dilution =The case of a randomly distributed x variable= The case that the x variable arises randomly is known as the structural model or structural relationship. For example, in a medical study patients are recruited as a sample from a population, and their characteristics such as blood pressure may be viewed as arising from a random sample. Under certain assumptions (typically, normal distribution assumptions) there is a known ratio between the true slope, and the expected estimated slope. Frost and Thompson (2000) review several methods for estimating this ratio and hence correcting the estimated slope.Frost, C. and S. Thompson (2000). \\"Correcting for regression dilution bias: comparison of methods for a single predictor variable.\\" Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A 163: 173‚Äì190. The term regression dilution ratio, although not defined in quite the same way by all authors, is used for this general approach, in which the usual linear regression is fitted, and then a correction applied. The reply to Frost & Thompson by Longford (2001) refers the reader to other methods, expanding the regression model to acknowledge the variability in the x variable, so that no bias arises. Fuller (1987) is one of the standard references for assessing and correcting for regression dilution. Hughes (1993) shows that the regression dilution ratio methods apply approximately in survival models. Rosner (1992) shows that the ratio methods apply approximately to logistic regression models. Carroll et al. (1995) give more detail on regression dilution in nonlinear models, presenting the regression dilution ratio methods as the simplest case of regression calibration methods, in which additional covariates may also be incorporated.Carroll, R. J., Ruppert, D., and Stefanski, L. A. (1995). Measurement error in non-linear models. New York, Wiley. In general, methods for the structural model require some estimate of the variability of the x variable. This will require repeated measurements of the x variable in the same individuals, either in a sub-study of the main data set, or in a separate data set. Without this information it will not be possible to make a correction. =The case of a fixed x variable= The case that x is fixed, but measured with noise, is known as the functional model or functional relationship. See, for example, Riggs et al. (1978). =Multiple x variables= The case of multiple predictor variables subject to variability (possibly correlated) has been well-studied for linear regression, and for some non-linear regression models. Other non-linear models, such as proportional hazards models for survival analysis, have been considered only with a single predictor subject to variability. Is correction necessary? In statistical inference based on regression coefficients, yes; in predictive modelling applications, correction is neither necessary nor appropriate. To understand this, consider the measurement error as follows. Let y be the outcome variable, x be the true predictor variable, and w be an approximate observation of x. Frost and Thompson suggest, for example, that x may be the true, long-term blood pressure of a patient, and w may be the blood pressure observed on one particular clinic visit. Regression dilution arises if we are interested in the relationship between y and x, but estimate the relationship between y and w. Because w is measured with variability, the slope of a regression line of y on w is less than the regression line of y on x. Does this matter? In predictive modelling, no. Standard methods can fit a regression of y on w without bias. There is bias only if we then use the regression of y on w as an approximation to the regression of y on x. In the example, assuming that blood pressure measurements are similarly variable in future patients, our regression line of y on w (observed blood pressure) gives unbiased predictions. An example of a circumstance in which correction is desired is prediction of change. Suppose the change in x is known under some new circumstance: to estimate the likely change in an outcome variable y, the slope of the regression of y on x is needed, not y on w. This arises in epidemiology. To continue the example in which x denotes blood pressure, perhaps a large clinical trial has provided an estimate of the change in blood pressure under a new treatment; then the possible effect on y, under the new treatment, should be estimated from the slope in the regression of y on x. Another circumstance is predictive modelling in which future observations are also variable, but not (in the phrase used above) \\"similarly variable\\". For example, if the current data set includes blood pressure measured with greater precision than is common in clinical practice. One specific example of this arose when developing a regression equation based on a clinical trial, in which blood pressure was the average of six measurements, for use in clinical practice, where blood pressure is usually a single measurement. =Caveats= All of these results can be shown mathematically, in the case of simple linear regression assuming normal distributions throughout (the framework of Frost & Thompson). It has been discussed that a poorly executed correction for regression dilution, in particular when performed without checking for the underlying assumptions, may do more damage to an estimate than no correction. Further reading Regression dilution was first mentioned, under the name attenuation, by Spearman (1904). Those seeking a readable mathematical treatment might like to start with Frost and Thompson (2000), or see correction for attenuation.

The decade saw the beginning of European settlement, marked by the introduction of crops from Europe and the New World and culminating in war with the Khoikhoi in 1659. Milestones Bernert Willemsz Wijlant, the first European baby, was born at the Cape on 6 June 1652. In 1654, Batavian convicts and political opponents were banished to the Cape bringing Islam to South Africa. Hout Bay, a sheltered cove just south of the Cape settlement is proposed as a settlement for Dutch families on 6 October 1654. Van Riebeeck sent Jan Wintervogel, a Dutch ensign, to scout the interior in 1655. Wintervogel went as far as Saldanha Bay. Van Riebeeck sent Willem Muller, a Dutch corporal, with the Khoikhoi interpreter, Autsumao, to explore the Hottentots Holland region. Maize and Grape vines were planted in the Cape that same year. In 1657, Abraham Gabbema was sent to scout the interior and explored as far as the Berg River and Paarl regions. Doman, the leader of the Goringhaiqua Khoikhoi, was sent to Batavia to be trained as an interpreter. Nine Dutch East India Company servants were freed to become free burghers (free citizens) on 21 February. They settled along the Liesbeeck River (now Rondebosch area). The first wine was pressed from Cape grapes on 2 February 1659. Jan van Riebeeck established the Burgher Militia on 1 May 1659. A few days later on 19 May, the Khoikhoi protested against white encroachment, leading to the first Khoikhoi-Dutch War. Slavery The Dutch East India Company gave van Riebeeck authority to bring slaves to South Africa in 1654. The Roode Vos ship sailed to Mauritius and Anongil Bay, Madagascar in search of slaves, but brought back none. In 1658, the Amersfoort ship stole 250 slaves from a Portuguese slave trading trafficking slaves from Angola to Brazil. The ship arrived in South Africa on 28 March with 170 slaves. 80 died during the trip. Later that year, the Hassalt ship brought 228 out of an initial 271 slaves from the Gulf of Guinea to South Africa on 6 May. 43 died at sea. After these two shipments, the Dutch East and West companies agreed to stop enslaving natives from lands controlled by the other company. Slave traffickers brought 63,000 slaves to South Africa between 1658 and 1808, when the British abolished the slave trade. Catharina Anthonis, became the first slave to be freed to marry Jan Woutersz, a Dutch settler, in 1656. In 1658 a Portuguese slaver was captured and 174 slaves were taken. About 80 were shipped to Batavia.

The components of a wire wheel are the rim, spokes, nipples, and hub. Goals The wheelwright must ensure that the wheel is true in two ways: lateral (sideways wobble) and radial (roundness/hop). The wheel also needs to be properly dished if applicable (the left and right sides of the rear wheel differ, the drive-side spokes requiring higher tension). Spokes should have no residual twist (windup) from tightening the nipples. The spokes may be \\"stress relieved\\", i.e. subjected to a greater tension during building than they are ever likely to encounter in use - usually by squeezing pairs of spokes together very hard. This 'yields' the spokes (and/or the hub) into a permanent shape where they bend around the hub flanges and each other. Spoking Spoking patterns may be radial or semi- tangential. For a normal wheel size and spoke count, only the latter is suitable for a wheel that has to transmit torque from the hub to the rim, as with rear wheels or hub brakes. This rule is occasionally broken where a very large number of spokes is used or the wheel is unusually small in diameter, either of which reduces the amount of increased tensile stress on each radial spoke to an acceptable degree; some BMX bicycles and low-riders use radial spoking for both wheels. Rear wheels may also incorporate radial spoking on the non-drive side and semi-tangential spoking on the drive side. At least one example, the Mavic Ksyrium, has radial spoking on the drive side of the rear wheel. The most common spoking pattern is \\"three-cross\\" where each spoke crosses three others on the same flange of the hub before meeting the rim. The last cross is normally \\"interlaced\\" by wrapping the spoke around the one from the other side of the flange. Radial-spoked wheels, where the spokes do not cross each other, saves roughly the weight of two spokes (because the spokes are shorter) compared to a three-cross wheel but run an increased risk of cracking at the hub flange, unless the hub is specifically designed for this pattern. Two-cross is sometimes used for hubs with large-diameter flanges (such as generator/dynamo hubs or large flange hubs), as it gives a more perpendicular spoke/rim angle, and four-cross is standard for spoke counts of 40 and above. Bicycle wheels Most conventional bicycle wheels now use 32 or 36 spokes front and rear, although the asymmetry of the rear wheel (to allow for the cluster of sprockets), and the additional weight it carries, means it benefits from having more spokes than the front. Commonly used models vary from 18 spokes for racing bikes to 36 for cross-country touring bikes to 48 spokes on tandems and heavily abused BMX bikes. The minimum number of spokes allowed for competition is 12.UCI Competition Rules - Some lowrider bicycles use as many as 144 brightly chromed spokes per wheel, although these are not meant for serious riding. Wheels can be built by machine instead of by hand. However, machine-built wheels are rarely as satisfactory as handbuilt wheels, partly because it is uneconomical to allow the machine to spend long enough on each wheel for a perfect result but also because most machines leave spokes with some residual twist. Machine-built wheels can be identified by their lacing pattern (if it is not radial), as the spokes are laced the same on each side, rather than mirrored as on hand-built wheels. More modern \\"factory built\\" wheels such as Mavic's Ksyrium series are of quite different construction from that of a conventional wheel, trading a deeper and stronger rim for fewer spokes. They are popular, and quite light (in the more expensive models) but not as durable, readily repairable or maintainable as a conventional wheel. Stainless steel is the most common material for spokes, although most mass-produced budget wheels use galvanized steel spokes. Other materials such as titanium or aluminum are often used to reduce weight. Some wheels are designed around carbon fiber spokes, which are often completely integrated with the hub and rim and bladed in shape. Non-steel spokes are normally reserved for racing bikes and other specialist applications where weight, aerodynamics and performance are valued over durability and cost. Rims were traditionally made of steel but currently aluminum is by far most common and best choice due to its light weight, high durability and stiffness. Wood is also used. Composite materials such as carbon fiber are sometimes used, typically for racing competitions such as time trial, triathlon and track cycling, although carbon fiber is becoming more common for recreational uses such as road cycling or mountain biking due to its looks, strength and feel. Motorcycle wheels Motorcycle wire wheels typically use 36 or 40 spokes, of much heavier gauge than those on a bicycle. They are never \\"interlaced\\" in the manner described above, nor are \\"radial\\" builds recommended (only wheels without brakes). Motorcycle rims are dimpled toward the hub at each spoke location, and the holes for the spokes are drilled into the dimples at an angle. This angle is a function of the cross-pattern used to lace the wheel, the diameter of the hub flanges, and the width of the hub at the flanges. Conical-hub wheels have a different angle drilled into one side of the rim when compared with the other side. Adequate spoke tension is very important with motorcycle wheels, because of the greater torque applied to the wheel by an engine or disc brake. Loose spokes on a wheel fatigue rapidly and break, usually at the bend where they attach to the hub. When this happens, the wheel must be rebuilt using all new spokes, because even unbroken spokes in such a wheel are fatigued, and will usually break when tightened during the truing operation. Spoke length The correct length of spokes required can be calculated using rim diameter, hub flange diameter, hub width, lacing pattern, and number of spokes. See and. These calculations can be done either by hand (the old-fashioned way - with a pen, paper and calculator) or by using a computer. There are many programs available and they range in complexity from simple Excel spreadsheets to stand alone desktop applications and web based calculators. An alternative method is to refer to a table which has the spoke lengths for a number of common hub and rim combinations. Other conventions A good wheelbuilder will ensure that the valve hole lies between two nearly parallel spokes to ease attachment of a pump head. This does not affect the structural integrity of the wheel, and this rule is usually observed. It is also a convention, if the hub has a maker's label on its barrel, for the label to face (and be readable through) the valve hole. See Gerd Schraner for methodology. The rim labels should be readable from the right-hand side (drive side) of the bicycle. The hub labels should face in the same direction front and rear (generally so they are readable from the seat), this means that even an undished, symmetrical front wheel has to be laced to the rim the \\"proper\\" way round, if perfection is the aim.

The engine allowed their team to script events, and move animated sprites against a drawn background with moving elements using a point-and-click style interface. Upon its first release, it rivaled competing engines like LucasArts' SCUMM and Sierra's Creative Interpreter, due to its then high level of artificial intelligence. The engine was first proposed in 1989, while the first game to use it, Lure of the Temptress, was released in 1992, followed by Beneath a Steel Sky (1994), Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars (1996) and Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror (1997). It allowed in-game characters to wander around the gameworld independently of each other, performing \\"everyday life\\" actions, which was not previously possible, and all characters and objects occupied space; consequently, non-player characters had to side-step the player's protagonist and any other object they came across, as well as the player having to side-step them, achieving a more realistic game world that previous engines were unable to provide, though non-player characters could unwittingly block a path as the player was traversing the game scene. Non-player characters performed much simpler tasks with each release due to size constraints. Two games (Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars and Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror) that use a Virtual Theatre variant engine can now be played on modern hardware using ScummVM, which as a result allows the engine to run on platforms where the titles were not officially released. In 2012, it was confirmed that the engine would be revived as \\"Virtual Theatre 7\\" for the fifth Broken Sword titled Broken Sword: The Serpent's Curse (2013). Development Charles Cecil and Tony Warriner had worked together at Artic Computing, an English video game development company. In 1990 they decided to set up their own video-game development company, together with David Sykes and Noirin Carmody. For their debut adventure game, Lure of the Temptress, released in 1992 for Amiga, Atari ST and PC, Cecil, Warriner, Sykes and Dan Marchant created the concept of the game engine titled \\"Virtual Theatre\\", which Warriner wrote. For Beneath a Steel Sky, released in 1994 for Amiga, and PC, Revolution used an updated version of Virtual Theatre, Virtual Theatre 2.0, written by Warriner and Sykes. However, because the game was six times the size of Lure of the Temptress, non-player characters had to perform much simpler tasks than in its predecessor. Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars, released in 1996 for PC, Mac and PlayStation, and its sequel, Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror, released in 1997 for PC and PlayStation, also used modified versions of the Virtual Theatre engine. The engine subsequently underwent various updates. For Broken Sword: The Serpent's Curse a brand-new engine (VT7) was developed in order to deal with multiple platforms and, in particular, with screen resolution (the system is built on C++ and OpenGL, and a custom scripting-language to implement the game itself). Features Traditionally in adventure game engines, non-player characters were static awaiting the player to interact with them to trigger an event. However, Virtual Theatre allowed non-player characters to traverse the world in seemingly random patterns, interacting with their environment. Upon the engine's first release, it rivaled competing engines such as LucasArts' SCUMM engine, and Sierra's Creative Interpreter, due to its then high level of artificial intelligence. Another advantage of the engine is that it is a cross-platform engine. It was also faster on the Amiga than the C code that was used by many USA programmers at that time. Compared to the Sierra titles, the engine became in this respect more sophisticated, a reason why Revolution did the conversion of King's Quest VI to the Amiga. All of the in-game objects (including non-player characters) in Virtual Theatre occupied space, which was a unique feature for an engine at the time. Consequently, non-player characters had to side-step the player's protagonist and any other object they came across, as well as the player had to side step them. When a non-player character bypassed the protagonist, he or she uttered a comment (like \\"Excuse me, Sir\\"). As the result, the engine achieved a more realistic game world than previous engines were able to provide, though non-player characters could unwittingly block a path as the player was traversing the game scene. This was remedied with the release of Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars, where the protagonist, if found his way blocked by another character, could simply walk through them. Two games (Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars and Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror) that use a Virtual Theatre variant engine can now be played on modern hardware using ScummVM.

Advanced bots feature machine learning for dynamic learning of patterns of the opponent as well as dynamic learning of previously unknown maps ‚Äì whereas more trivial bots may rely completely on lists of waypoints created for each map by the developer, limiting the bot to play only maps with said waypoints. Using bots is generally against the rules of current massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), but a significant number of players still use MMORPG bots for games like RuneScape. MUD players may run bots to automate laborious tasks, which can sometimes make up the bulk of the gameplay.

Bot types  Bots may be static, dynamic, or both. Static bots are designed to follow pre-made waypoints for each level or map. These bots need a unique waypoint file for each map. For example, Quake III Arena bots use an area awareness system file to move around the map, while Counter-Strike bots use a waypoint file. Dynamic bots learn the levels and maps as they play, such as RealBot for Counter- Strike. Some bots are designed using both static and dynamic features.

He first appeared in Batman #567 (July 1999), and was created by Kelley Puckett and Damion Scott. Fictional character biography =The assassin= David Cain is one of the world's premier assassins, whose victims have included some of the most famous and powerful people on the planet. He trained the young Bruce Wayne with some of the skills that he would use as Batman, although Bruce has never used some of the more lethal techniques Cain taught him and has since surpassed his teacher in ability. Regarding his decision to train with an assassin, Batman explained, \\"Knowing how to kill doesn't mean you must kill\\". Cain desired a perfect partner with whom to carry out his assassination plans. Attempts to train young children resulted in failure, so he decided to conceive one himself. He found the perfect mother in a martial artist named Sandra Wu-San. He watched her duel her sister at a tournament and concluded that it was her sister Carolyn that was holding Sandra back from her full potential. He murdered Carolyn and ambushed Sandra with the help of Ra's al Ghul and his League of Assassins. In exchange for sparing her life, Sandra agreed to bear David's child and leave the child in his care for him to train. The child, Cassandra, would be Cain's \\"One Who Is All,\\" whose native tongue was one-on- one combat. This gave her the ability to read people's intentions simply by their body language. The latter was a special gift that only the Wu-San sisters and Cassandra knew. After bearing his child, Sandra set out to become Lady Shiva. =The father= Cain trained Cassandra in every imaginable form of violence, from hand-to-hand combat to weapons and explosives. Cain never taught her to read or write, and even avoided speaking in her presence; her only language was her ability to read people and predict what her opponents were going to do. His training methods were tantamount to child abuse. When she was 8 years old, Cain took her to kill a businessman. After she did, she \\"read\\" him as he died, she saw death as the man saw it. \\"Terror and then... nothing\\". It was this reading that made her decide that murder was wrong and she ran away from Cain, Cain musing in hindsight that he simply pushed her too far too young. Cain was first introduced into the Batman universe in the No Man's Land (1999) comic book arc. Two-Face hires him to assassinate James Gordon. Cassandra spots him and saves Gordon's life. After she has burned Two- Face's money to void the contract and refuses to come back to him, Cain leaves Gotham, briefly tearful at hearing his daughter's first word (\\"Stop\\"). In Cassandra's Batgirl book, Cain is shown to be depressed and alcoholic, constantly rewatching old tapes of Cassandra's training. He later broadcasts a video into the Batcave that reveals what Cassandra had done years ago, but Batman continues to trust her when she deliberately charges towards an armed opponent to save an innocent man, explaining that her reason for doing so was instinct. =Framing Bruce Wayne= Lex Luthor hired Cain to frame Bruce Wayne for the murder of Vesper Fairchild, however Cain had an ulterior motive; determining whether or not Batman was worthy enough of raising Cassandra. Having realised that Bruce was Batman, Cain not only framed Bruce Wayne for Vesper's murder, but planted a complex sequence of evidence to suggest that Wayne killed her because she had deduced Batman's true identity, infiltrating the Batcave and doctoring and then erasing Vesper's electronic journal in such a manner that only the Bat-family could determine what he had done. Although Batman briefly flees with the intention of abandoning his life as Bruce Wayne, a series of events force him to recognise the importance of his civilian life, while Cassandra determines that Cain was responsible after examination of Vesper's corpse reveals that she was first immobilised with a nerve strike Cain taught her and Bruce. Luring Cain into a confrontation near the end of the story arc, Cain concludes that Batman is indeed worthy and turns himself in to clear Wayne's name.Batman #605 (September 2002) Luthor hires Deadshot to kill Cain while he is in jail due to a fear of him implicating Luthor in Fairchild's murder. Cain has a death wish and almost allows himself to be killed before being reminded of Cassandra. He then fights back and shoots Deadshot repeatedly, intentionally leaving him alive to prove a point. Cassandra visits Cain while in jail and attacks him, threatening to kill him if he ever commits another murder. Cain was proud of this and told Cassandra the date of her birthday and said that \\"My little girl... all grown up.\\" Later, he escaped from prison undetected to give Cassandra a birthday present before returning. =Truth and consequences= Cassandra recently became curious as to the identity of her birth mother, believing it to be Lady Shiva. When she visited Cain in prison, he refused to tell her. Cassandra eventually confirmed her suspicions when she met Lady Shiva herself. As a result, Cassandra also quit being the super heroine Batgirl. =One Year Later= thumb Following the One Year Later continuity jump, Robin captures Cain and brings him to the League of Assassins as ransom to save Cassandra, only to find that Cassandra is their leader. Cassandra explains that she chose to join the League because she found that Cain had trained other children in addition to her.Robin #150 (July 2006) Her actions were later explained to be the result of Deathstroke injecting her with a mind-altering serum. After her speech, Cassandra handed Robin a gun to kill David, offering him a place in her League. When he refused, she shot her father herself. Cain tells Robin that there were other girls in addition to Cassandra and Annalea before apparently dying. Afterwards, Robin and Cassandra fight. The battle ends when an explosion causes a fire to break out. By the time Robin returns to where he had left Cain's body, it is gone and the assassins' necks are broken. =Batgirl= In the 2008 Batgirl mini-series, it is revealed that Deathstroke had given Cassandra the gun she used to shoot Cain, which was not fatal. After Tim and Cassandra started fighting, Deathstroke got up and killed the ninjas himself.Batgirl #2 He hoped to open up an \\"assassination shop\\" with Cassandra as his second-in-command, using a drug that would turn his army into metahumans. He disappears when Cassandra murders the businessman who was providing that drug. Cain then plots with Slade to \\"cripple the meta-hero community\\". Cassandra, who used listening devices to overhear, believes that Oracle is the target of this plot and races to Platinum Heights, Oracle's base of operations, to rescue her.Batgirl #5 Cassandra locates her father on a rooftop and engages in one-on-one combat. He slides over an edge and is hanging by one hand. Cassandra contemplates whether to save him or not; when he falls, she attempts to grab him. She sees that he only fell a few feet to a ledge below, where he is arrested by Batman, who had followed Cassandra there.Batgirl #6 =The New 52= David Cain appeared in The New 52 as an assassin working for the villain named \\"Mother\\" in Batman and Robin Eternal.Batman Eternal #1 In this continuity, David is known by the assassin name \\"Orphan\\" and raises his daughter Cassandra in a very similar way as portrayed in the Pre-Flashpoint continuity. He brings Cassandra up in an extremely isolated environment. She was trained in all manner of hand-to-hand combat and effectively reading body-language, making her able to predict and anticipate her opponent's attacks. Much like before The New 52, he refrained from showing her any love or affection as a father, not even teaching her how to speak in full sentences. He raised her this way at the behest of Mother, who believes that the perfect assassin could only be molded from exposure to a traumatic existence from a very young age. In DC Rebirth, it is revealed that David fathered the child with Lady Shiva, an assassin for the League of Shadows.Detective Comics Volume 3: League of Shadows In other media David Cain was alluded to in Batman: Arkham Origins. He was referenced in a file in the Sionis Steel Mill that had a reject stamp on it, implying that the Joker (while disguised as Black Mask) considered hiring his services to assassinate the Batman, but decided against it just like he decided against hiring Black Spider and Cheshire. His name is also mentioned in Lady Shiva's assassin profile in the beginning of the game alongside Richard Dragon and Nyssa Raatko as being her associates.

The protagonist is a future historian of the 20th century and finds himself shifting in time from the future to that time period. At first, it is unclear whether he is merely a man from the past imagining a future life, or vice versa. The ending of the story remains ambiguous, as it is revealed that with the use of a \\"time gate\\" the man may have actually traveled through time.

He defeated the incumbent Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai in the 1991 general election. Known for his charismatic style, Bhandari had propounded the popular communist principle or thought People's Multiparty Democracy (). He is widely regarded for peaking the Nepal's communist movement to a greater height. He died in a jeep accident in Dasdhunga, Chitwan, in 1993. Life Madan Bhandari was born in the Dhungesangu village of Taplejung district in eastern Nepal. He studied in Medibung School in Taplejung and in Varanasi, India. In 1972, he became a central committee member of the Janabadi Sanskritik Morcha (Democratic Cultural Front), a student movement established by Pushpa Lal Shrestha. Around 1976 he left Pushpa Lal's Communist Party of Nepal to create the Mukti Morcha Samuha (\\"Liberation Front Group\\"), which formed an alliance with the survivors of the Jhapa Movement in 1978. He was a founding member of the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist) preceding the 1980 referendum and was elected General-Secretary at its Fourth National Congress in 1986. Bhandari became the General-Secretary when CPN (ML) merged into the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) in 1991. He played a central role in the CPN (UML) program of \\"People's Multiparty Democracy,\\" which left his party as the strongest communist party in Nepal for several years even after his death.Chancen f√ºr Nepals angeschlagene Demokratie?  1991 Elections and aftermath  The CPN (UML), under the leadership of Bhandari, won all but one seat in the Himalayan capital in the 1991 elections, the country's first free election after more than three decades. Bhandari proclaimed this \\"a vote for democracy,\\" \\"a vote for independence\\" and \\"a vote for the alleviation of poverty.\\" He argued for the popular vote as opposed to armed struggle as the main tactic for communists.  Personal life  Bhandari was married to Bidhya Devi Bhandari in 1982. Ms. Bhandari at the time of her wedding to Bhandari was a junior political cadre of his party who later became the first female President of Nepal. The couple had two daughters, Usha Kiran Bhandari and Nisha Kusum Bhandari. Both daughters are married.  Death  On May 16, 1993 Bhandari died in a car accident in Dasdhunga, Chitwan. According to an investigation led by K.P. Oli, it was not an accident but an unsolved murder. Of the three people inside the car, only the driver Amar Lama survived; the two leaders Madan Bhandari and Jibaraj Ashrit died. His body was recovered three days later and kept in Dasharath Rangashala, where people visited throughout the day and into the night to pay their respects. The only survivor of that crash, driver Amar Lama, was murdered 10 years later. A group of unidentified gunmen abducted Lama from the office of Tajakhabar Weekly tabloid around 13:45. He was taken to the hamlet of Kirtipur on the southwestern outskirts of the capital and shot. The assassins then fled towards Panga village. Aftermath A bust has been built at the spot of the accident at Dasdhunga. The government of Nepal proposed to build Madan Bhandari Highway from Shantinagar of Jhapa district to Rupal of Dadheldhura district.

Retrieved 21 November 2013 The earliest written record of Whitchurch dates from 909 AD in a charter by which King Edward the Elder confirmed the manor of Whitchurch to the monks of Winchester as England recovered from the Viking onslaught of the previous fifty years. It next appears in the Domesday Book of 1086. This records the name as 'Witcerce', occupying in the 'Hundred of Evingar' and also records that Witcerce was 'owned' by the monks at Winchester. Another theory on the origin of the name is that it means \\"Place of Proclamation\\". In parts of the north of England we see it reflected in Whit Walks, with Roman Catholics and Protestants choosing different days over the Whit Period for their Whit Walks. Whitchurch is well placed, being at the crossroads for north‚Äìsouth, east‚Äìwest travellers. =13th century= Looking from the town along the River Test towards the Whitchurch Silk Mill By 1241, it was known as Witcherche and was becoming prosperous, holding a market on Mondays in the market place. This was a vital feature of medieval society, and produce such as butter, eggs, fruit and livestock were brought in for sale from the outlying farms and villages. Witcherche received a royal charter in 1285, having become a borough in 1284. The land ownership had by now passed to a form of tenure known as a burgage. As a borough, it was governed by a Court Leet. Meetings were held in the village hall each year, in October, to elect a mayor and burgesses. Witcherche's prosperity was again on the rise due to its widespread sheep farming, the wool being a valuable commodity at the time. The River Test provided the power for at least four watermills, located every half-mile along the river through the town. The Town Mill was the source of power for milling corn, and other mills were used for finishing wool, weaving silk and dressing cloth. Only Whitchurch Silk Mill survives, the others having been converted into residential dwellings. The Silk Mill is a popular visitor attraction where silk is still produced after a very small interruption in 2012. =16th century= When Henry VIII died in 1547 his nine-year-old son, Edward VI, inherited the throne. Under Thomas Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Edward Seymour the Lord Protector, England became more Protestant, and the people of Whitchurch were persecuted for their religious beliefs for six years until the death of Edward and the succession of Mary. Also during the 16th century, under the reign of Elizabeth the town had become large and prosperous enough to send its first two members to Parliament in 1586. Until 1832, it was known as a Rotten Borough, as the members were nominated by an absent landlord. =18th century= The town hall was built during the reign of Queen Anne. In 1712, Henri de Portal, a Huguenot refugee from France, established a paper mill at Bere Mill in Whitchurch, producing exceptionally hard and close-textured paper. The quality of the paper was considered so high that within twelve years, Portal was supplying the Bank of England, a tradition that still continues. Portal eventually naturalised to English nationality, and established a second mill at Laverstoke; in more recent times the business moved to neighbouring Overton, where it is still based today. He died in 1747, and is buried at All Hallows, Whitchurch. =19th century= Plaque in The Square, commemorating liberty at Whitchurch won by The Salvation Army in 1890. In 1888, the Star newspaper reported: > Whitchurch is in Hampshire. People who live IN it call it a town. People who > live OUT of it call it a village. It is about as big as a good-sized pocket > handkerchief. It has three shops and 19 public houses. Also in 1888, Charles Denning and Clara Thomas married in Lincoln. They set up home in Whitchurch, where Clara's father had purchased two houses for them in Newbury Street. Here Charles established a drapery business. It was also here that one of their children, Alfred Thompson or \\"Tom\\", grew up. He later became one of the most renowned judges in English legal history ‚Äì Lord Denning, Master of the Rolls. The house in Newbury Street is today marked with a commemorative plaque. Before returning to the Court of Appeal as Master of the Rolls, Denning, for a time, was a member of the judicial committee of the House of Lords, taking the title Baron Denning of Whitchurch. Towards the end of the 19th century, the Salvation Army and its open-air services were the dominant talking point. They maintained that they had a right to hold these services but were prosecuted for obstructing the highways and causing a disturbance. The conviction in 1889 of one group, and their subsequent treatment by the authorities, led to demonstrations. In October 1889, 5000 Salvationists and 12 Salvation Army bands demonstrated in the Town Square at Whitchurch. They were charged with riot, unlawful assembly and rout, and the Salvationists applied for the case to be heard in the High Court of Justice. In July 1890, the court found in their favour and set down laws granting the public the right to hold orderly public demonstrations, which were the rules followed until the beginning of the 21st century, when the government overturned them. =21st century= During the night of 7 February 2018, Henri de Portal's former paper mill, Bere Mill, which had been converted into a farmhouse, was largely destroyed by a major fire. =All Hallows' Church= All Hallows' Church The Saxon church was the original \\"white church\\", because it was built of limestone or chalk. The church and all its property were given by Henry de Blois in 1132 to St Cross Hospital in Winchester and the gift was confirmed by Richard I in 1189. Little is known about the earlier Saxon structure because its Norman lords built a more imposing successor which is the basis of the present parish church of All Hallows. One Saxon remnant is the grave cover of Frithburga.Frithburga ‚Äì the Anglo Saxon women from Hampshire The first stage was completed in about 1190 when the three western bays on the south side of the nave were added. A north aisle was added in the 15th century. The tower was re-built in 1716 but still features the original oak stair turret. The whole church was largely re-built in 1866 and the square Norman tower was capped by a Gothic Revival spire. It is a Grade 2* Listed Building and the oldest remaining structure in the town. All Hallows is also widely known for its 3-manual pipe organ with 41 stops dating from 1935, and a peal of 10 bells in the tower. The earliest of the six bells in the tower is of 15th-century origin and the others were gifts made in the 17th and 18th centuries. The bells were cast in a field belonging to a farm in Wood Street, now called Bell Street. The spire of All Hallows weighs 500 tons and is held in place by its own weight. Present day The population is 8,962. The town is a growing community with a combination of residential areas and some light industry, and serves as a small commuter town to London (approximately 60 miles to the east) and to a lesser extent Basingstoke, Andover, Newbury and Winchester. Lynch Hill Park, a small housing development, was used in a TV advert for Roysters crisps because of its \\"typical\\" American appearance. The centre of the town is a roundabout known as The Square. =Transport= The B3400 road (Basingstoke to Andover) runs through the town. Bus services include Stagecoach routes 76 (Andover-Whitchurch-Overton-Basingstoke) and 86 (Winchester-South wonston-Sutton Scotney and Whitchurch town centre ) The railway station is at the north end of the town. The former Whitchurch Town railway station (closed 1960) was closer to the town centre. =Education= Testbourne Community School is a foundation school and was rated as \\"outstanding\\" in November 2010 by Ofsted. It has had performing arts specialist status since 2005 and educates around 1000 students aged 11‚Äì16. Whitchurch Church of England Primary School serves the younger students in the town and its surrounding areas. It was rated in January 2011 as \\"good\\" with a number of \\"outstanding\\" features, by OFSTED. The headteacher, Sarah Peters, started in April 2008, and left in 2014. Zoe Newton, the deputy headteacher, acted as headmistress until September 2015. The current headteacher is Kate Steven. =Leisure and sport= Whitchurch has a Non-League football club Whitchurch United F.C., which plays at Longmeadow. Also at the Longmeadow sports facility is a Bowls club with indoor and outdoor pitches, and a Squash club with 2 squash courts. Whitchurch also have two Cricket teams playing at the local Cricket Ground (Parsonage Meadow) where skipper Simon Ralph and his band of merry little cricketing men try to avoid relegation for the second year in a row. As well as the thriving amateur theatre group called WADS, which was established in 1958, there is also an annual beer festival held at the Longmeadow Sports and Social Club, this is run by the North Hampshire branch of the Campaign for Real Ale. Being positioned on the Southern edge of the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty as well as at the junction of several river valleys, Whitchurch has many opportunities for cycling, both strenuous and sedate, on-road and off. Popular cycle routes include over to the Bourne Valley, the Hampshire County Council Off-Road Mountainbike loop, and down the Test Valley to Longparish. There is a BMX cycle track and a 'Sk8' board area in Daniel Park, which together with its adjoining open space next to the primary school, has been put forward as a Queen Elizabeth II field in the hope of protecting it forever. The Whitchurch Town Council maintains a couple of children's playgrounds: one in Kingsley Park, and the other at the bottom of Alliston Way between the schools. Other play areas are at Caesar's Way and Park View. =Environment= The River Test throughout the town, including its various branches and banks, is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Much of the land to the south of the town centre is old water meadow. One site is administered by Whitchurch Millennium Green Trust, a registered charity. This has an old dam used for flooding the meadow in the past and a sluice and wooden sheep dip hundreds of years old. Its ponds have viewing platforms. The old maps show how it was fed by springs. One key spring still exists at Ninesprings Nursery on The Weir. It originally fed what is now thought to be some of the oldest watercress beds in Britain. They are shown on the 1810 map and the 1872 and 1876 maps show them clearly also the history of how the River Test was diverted. The site now grows aquatic plants that are distributed nationally. =First Place Winner in BT Competition= Whitchurch was ranked first in the BT \\"Race to Infinity\\" competition that finished on 31 December 2010. The win meant that the residents served from the exchange (01256-89 prefix) would be one of the first ten rural areas in Britain to be upgraded to fibre-optic technology. The hope was that this would bring faster Internet speeds sooner to residences, businesses, schools and doctors both in the town itself and to its surrounding villages and the rural communities in-between. The Whitchurch Faster Broadband Campaign saw participation by many volunteers who went \\"door knocking\\" in the midst of a severe December snowstorm to secure the votes required to win. In the end, the final score was 104%, as many people without landlines or Internet access were able to cast their vote. In addition, the town also won ¬£5000 of computer equipment from BT for use by a community project.\\"‚Ä¶and now we WIN ¬£5000!\\" . The money was split between the primary school and the Whitchurch Association who created an IT Library. The Whitchurch Association, a registered charity, spearheaded the campaign and the collection of ideas for the community project; the Whitchurch Town Council underwrote the campaign and several local businesses contributed. The campaign was also supported by the schools, the doctor's surgery, churches, and politicians, including the area's local MP, The Rt Hon Sir George Young Bt. Roll-out began in May 2012 but progress to reach everyone in town ‚Äì and in the neighbouring areas ‚Äì was slow.\\"Faster Broadband ‚Äì List of Articles\\" . Some people report that the actual speeds they obtained using the new system was not as fast as they were led to believe they would be.\\"Faster Internet campaigner slowly gets sped up\\" . =Town website= Following a grant from SEEDA, the town website was launched on 1 May 2010. The site is administered by the Whitchurch Association on behalf of the town residents. Any resident is able to contribute, and the site's ethos is non- political, following that of the Whitchurch Association. =High-Caffeine Drinks Ban= A report given by the police to the Whitchurch Town Council on 4 April 2011 stated, \\"We have also asked shops in Whitchurch not to sell 'Kick, Red Bull or any other stimulation drinks to youths under 16 on Friday evenings\\". The story was picked up by local media and later, national media. The police request came after meetings with the Whitchurch Youth Project and an assembly at Testbourne school, in a bid to reduce antisocial behaviour. =Hampshire Potato Day= Actually two days, the last full weekend in January, see the arrival in the town of around 2,000 keen gardeners from all over the South of England searching for seed potatoes not available anywhere else in the country. The event boasts the largest selection of varieties available to amateur growers in one place in the world; in 2008 that was 143.

Dick. It was received by the Scott Meredith Literary Agency on June 24, 1953, and first published in the April 1954 issue of If magazine.Rickman, Gregg (1989), To the High Castle: Philip K. Dick: A Life 1928‚Äì1963, Long Beach, Ca.: Fragments West/The Valentine Press, p. 389 The story was illustrated by Kelly Freas in its original publication.Levack, Daniel (1981). PKD: A Philip K. Dick Bibliography, Underwood/Miller, p. 97 The story is set in a post-apocalyptic future where the existence of potentially powerful mutants has become a reality. The mutants are seen as dangerous and have been hunted to death by human beings for years. A golden-skinned mutant called Cris is captured by the government, which attempts to execute him. However, his appearance and abilities to see into the future allow him to escape. Plot summary The protagonists of the story are a government agent and his fianc√©e who are members of a government agency tasked with tracking down and sterilizing or eliminating mutants- individuals with physical abnormalities and superhuman powers (such as the ability to steal the appearance and memories of others) that make them a threat to normal humans. The eponymous \\"Golden Man\\" is a feral young man named Cris with gold-colored skin, who does not appear to be sapient but possesses the ability to see into the future (specifically, the ability to see all possible outcomes from any single action, described in the story as similar to a chess player with the ability to see all possible moves 5 steps ahead). The agency manages to capture Cris, but does not execute him immediately, due to their wish to study his ability. Unknown to the agency, Cris turns out to possess another power; his golden skin acts like a lion's mane and allows him to seduce members of the opposite sex. Cris influences the fianc√©e into freeing him, then impregnates her and makes his escape. The story ends with the protagonist reflecting on how animal instincts have triumphed over human intellect, and how that is the new direction evolution will take if Cris succeeds in replacing humanity.

When it reported back, a year later, the Guantanamo Review Task Force classified some individuals as too dangerous to be transferred from Guantanamo, even though there was insufficient evidence to justify charging them. On April 9, 2013, that document was made public after a Freedom of Information Act request.

Evolution First generation Chevrolet Celta Rear view It was released in 2000 in Brazil as a three-door hatchback with a gasoline engine, based on the Corsa B and with design features similar to those of the Vectra. In 2002 a five-door version was made available, and the engine power was increased to at 6,400 rpm, the same VHC (Very High Compression) technology used in the Latin American Corsa C. A gasoline engine was added in 2003. flex fuel version of the Chevrolet Celta Chevrolet Prisma Chevrolet Prisma An \\"Off-Road\\" accessories kit was for sale for both old and new Celtas in 2005, and the 1.0 L was converted into a gasoline-ethanol flexible fuel engine (gasoline versions are still available, especially outside Brazil). In 2006, the Celta underwent a facelift, which provided for a more modern look and an enhancement of build quality. The new front fascia makes it closer to new Chevrolet models, especially the new Brazilian Vectra. A sedan version, named Chevrolet Prisma was released in early 2007. It was not meant to replace Classic (a low cost sedan version of the Corsa B) neither the Corsa Sedan (C), but to fill a market gap between them instead. The only available engine option is a 1.4 L Econo.Flex gasoline/ethanol flexible fuel engine. Its high compression rate gives as a result a maximum output of 97 PS when running on ethanol and 95 hp when running on gasoline. Early 2009 marked the release of the Prisma 1.0 litre and the new VHC-E engine ( gasoline and ethanol) for Prisma and Celta. By early 2012, 1.5 million Celtas had been built in Gravata√≠. Safety The Chevrolet Celta has been rated as highly unsafe by Latin NCAP in 2011, scoring only one star for adult occupants and two stars for children. Important to mention that when Celta was developed (2000) there was no Latin NCAP protocol available and that all regulatory safety items were met for the countries were Celta was sold.Latin NCAP report Chevrolet Celta Technical details The 1.0 L gasoline engine has a high power to displacement ratio (51 kW/L, 70 PS/L or 1.1 hp/cu in). However, this power is only available at 6400 rpm, and the maximum torque is 8.6 kgf¬∑m (88 N¬∑m) at 3000 rpm. Today, the Celta is sold only with the 1.0 FlexPower (the 1.4 MPFI stopping production in 2007). In 2002 GM changed the 1.0 MPFI () engine to a 1.0 VHC (), in 2005 to VHC FlexPower (70 PS with Petrol or alcohol), and in 2009 to VHCE FlexPower (77 PS with Petrol and 78 PS with alcohol). The total weight is approximately 850 kg (1,872 lb). In Uruguay, Celta 1.4 MPFI are available since 2009 as the 'new' Celta with the new front lights and all facelift add-ons.

Plot The story follows the course of the life of Suriyothai from her adolescence to her death. As Suriyothai is only known from three lines in a chronicle, most of the film relies on an invented story rather than claiming to be actual history. It presents a young woman, Suriyothai, of minor royal standing who has strong opinions and self- determination. The movie reveals the princess' boldness through scenes where she breaks tradition by walking among the commoners to meet her lover Prince Pirenthorathep, who in turn pledges that he will come to her aid whenever she wants. Her father insists that she must marry Prince Thienraja, the son of the second king of the realm. In an attempt to escape a marriage she does not want, she runs away and is captured by the principal king who explains the possible problems her marriage to Piren might cause to Siam. For the good of the kingdom, she marries Prince Tien to keep peace in the royal families. From this point on she remains loyal to the man she likes but does not love and remains strongly independent. The principal king dies, and Tien's father inherits the throne. A few years later, smallpox makes its first appearance in Siam and the king is stricken with the disease. On his deathbed he extracts a promise of support for his young son from Chai Raja, his nephew, and Tien. Burma invades in the north and Chai Raja assumes the throne to protect Siam. He executes the child king, which Tien protests but on Suriyothai's advice accepts Chai Raja as his ruler. Chai Raja's wife, Queen Jitravadee, dies shortly after giving birth to the heir Yodfa. The king takes a new consort, Srisudachan, and has a son by her. After several years of peace, Chai Raja leaves the capital, Ayutthaya, for a military campaign in the north. Soon after, Srisudachan, descended from the deposed U-Tong dynasty, takes Boonsri Worawongsa, another U-Tong descendant, as a lover and starts plotting to take over the throne. The king is wounded in battle and comes back to the capital to recuperate, where Srisudachan poisons him and attempts to blame the deed on Tien. Tien saves his own life by becoming a Buddhist monk. Srisudachan proceeds by naming Worawongsa as regent and promptly poisoning young Yodfa, thereby assuming power. Suriyothai then summons her old friend Piren, who was Chai Raja's troop commander, to help set things right. His troops ambush and kill Worawongsa and Srisudachan, and Tien accepts the throne despite his monkhood. Upon hearing this, Burmese King Hongsa invades again and lays siege to Ayutthaya. In a dramatic finale, however, the Burmese invade the new kingdom, and Queen Suriyothai heroically rides into battle with her husband and her unrequited childhood love at her side.MovieGuide. \\"THE LEGEND OF SURIYOTHAI.\\" Rev. of The Legend of Suriyothai. n.d.: n. pag. Movieguide. 20 June 2003. Web. The queen is slain, falling in slow motion from the elephant in full uniform with her throat cut. The ending scene reveals a traditional funeral for royals. Production =Background= The film was financed by Queen Sirikit, who appointed royal family members to the directorial position (Chatrichalerm) and to the role of the lead actress. Chatrichalerm wrote the screenplay and directed. Kamla, his wife, designed the costumes and served as a producer. Because of Queen Sirikit's backing, when the script called for a large number of men in the battle scenes, Royal Thai Army and Royal Thai Navy personnel were called upon to help make up the thousands of extras required. Chatrichalerm states that The Legend of Suriyothai was originally the idea of Queen Sirikit. According to Chatrichalerm, the Queen wanted the Thai people to have a better understanding of their history and felt that a motion picture would be a good way to accomplish this. Chatrichalerm and Queen Sirikit mutually agreed to use Suriyothai as their first subject. Documents sent to King John III of Portugal (1521‚Äì1557) from Domingos de Seixas, a mercenary in the Ayutthaya Kingdom from 1524 to 1549, were consulted. The film depicts some Portuguese, and their introduction of Early Modern warfare, but the only one with a speaking part depicts a physician called to the deathbed of the poisoned king. A follow-up film on King Naresuan, King Naresuan was release in 2007. Amporn Jirattikorn argues that other motivations for the film included a fear of foreign influence after the 1997 Asian financial crisis and competition from another historical figure, the sister to King Naresuan. According to Jirattikorn, the film attempts to provide a national hero connected to the current monarchical dynasty, in contrast to other Thai films presenting events of the same era (e.g., Bang Rajan). The movie uses many locations and sites in Thailand as its sets and with its massive cast and expensive production richly displays life in the 16th century. The battle scenes employed thousands of extras and there are hundreds of real elephants used as moving battle platforms. It took three years to shoot. It is rumored that the film cost between US$8 and 20 million, making it the most expensive Thai film ever made. However, due to the involvement of the Thai Royal Family, any figure is hard to substantiate. Additionally, the royal family‚Äôs association with this motion picture allowed filming in locations that would have been difficult or even impossible for any other director to access. =Alternative versions= When the film was released on August 12, 2001 in Thailand, it was simply titled Suriyothai and had a running time of 185 minutes. This is pared down quite a bit from its intended eight-hour length. A five-hour version exists in a DVD box-set released in Thailand. In 2003, it was released in the United States, with a running time of 142 minutes. This version was edited by Francis Ford Coppola. The US release by Sony Pictures Classics in association with Coppola's company American ZoetropeAmerican Zoetrope [us] was entitled Francis Ford Coppola Presents: The Legend of Suriyothai. Some critics argue that the original Thai release was the better presentation of the film, with others even preferring the five-hour DVD set, which does have English subtitles. Cast =Casting notes= The film stars another Thai royal, Piyapas Bhirombhakdi, as Queen Sri Suriyothai. She is a royal descendant, carrying the title M.L., or Mom Luang. Thai pop star Mai Charoenpura is among the highlighted performers, portraying the scheming Lady Srisudachan. Other cast members include Sarunyu Wongkrachang as Prince Thien, Chatchai Plengpanich as Lord Piren and Johnny Anfone as Lord Worawongsa. Other actors and actresses from Thai film history appear, including action-movie veteran Sombat Metanee and Sorapong Chatree, who appeared in many of Chatrichalerm's films in the 1970s and 1980s. =Partial cast listing=ML Piyapas Bhirombhakdi as Queen Suriyothai *Sarunyoo Wongkrachang as King Maha Chakkraphat (Prince Thien Rajah) *Chatchai Plengpanich as Lord Pirenthorathep *Johnny Anfone as Lord Worawongsa *Mai Charoenpura as Lady Srisudachan *Sinjai Plengpanich as Lady Srichulalak *Sorapong Chatree as Viscount Rajseneha *Sombat Metanee as Lord Minye Thihathu *Suphakit Tangthatswasd as King Tabinshwehti *Saharat Sangkapreecha as Lord Bayinnaung *Ronrittichai Khanket as Viceroy of Pyay * Warut Woradhamm as Sihatu *Pongpat Wachirabunjong as King Chairachathirat *Phimonrat Phisarayabud as Young Suriyothai *Amphol Lampoon as Lord Intarathep *Penpak Sirikul as Queen Jiraprapa Critical reception In his review of The Legend of Suriyothai in technohistory.com, Steve Sanderson states \\"The film's celebration of female power is initially refreshing, suggesting some nascent feminist impulse.\\"Anderson, Steve. \\"Review of the Legend of Suriyothai.\\" Rev. of Legend of Suriyothai Movie.

It is based on a short story Raimi wrote that paid homage to Universal's horror films of the 1930s. The film stars Liam Neeson as Peyton Westlake, a scientist who is brutally attacked, disfigured and left for dead by a ruthless mobster, Robert Durant (Larry Drake), after his girlfriend, an attorney (Frances McDormand), runs afoul of a corrupt developer (Colin Friels). After a failed treatment to cure him of his burn injuries, Westlake develops super-human abilities, which also have the unintended side-effect of rendering him mentally unstable and borderline psychotic. Consumed with vengeance, he decides to hunt down the men responsible for his disfigurement. Unable to secure the rights to either The Shadow or Batman, Raimi decided to create his own superhero and struck a deal with Universal Studios to make his first Hollywood studio film. It was produced by Robert Tapert, and was written by Raimi, his brother Ivan Raimi and Chuck Pfarrer. The design and creation of the makeup effects required to turn Liam Neeson into Darkman were the handiwork of makeup effects artist Tony Gardner, who also cameos in the film as the Lizard Man in the carnival Freak Show sequence. Neeson's first action film, Darkman received generally positive reviews by critics and was a box office success, grossing almost $49 million worldwide, well above its $16 million budget. This financial success spawned two direct-to-video sequels, Darkman II: The Return of Durant (1995) and Darkman III: Die Darkman Die (1996), as well as comic books, video games, and action figures. Neeson does not reprise his role for the direct-to-video sequels. Plot Dr. Peyton Westlake is developing a new type of synthetic skin to help burn victims, but cannot get past a flaw that causes the skin to rapidly disintegrate after 99 minutes. His girlfriend, attorney Julie Hastings, discovers the Belisarius Memorandum, an incriminating document that proves developer Louis Strack Jr. has been bribing members of the zoning commission. When she confronts Strack, he confesses, showing Julie that he plans to design a brand new city, creating a substantial number of new jobs. He warns Julie that the city's reigning crime boss, Robert Durant, also wants the document. At Westlake's lab, Westlake and his assistant Yakitito are testing the skin when the lights go out. The synthetic skin is stable after 100 minutes; Westlake deduces the skin is photosensitive. Their joy is short lived as Durant and his mobsters show up and demand the Memorandum, which Westlake knows nothing about. They search for the document, and Durant has his men kill Yakitito and beat Westlake, burning his hands and dipping his face in acid. After finding the document, they rig the lab to explode; it does so as Julie watches. The blast throws a hideously burned Westlake through the roof and into the river. As a John Doe, he is brought to a hospital and subjected to a radical treatment which cuts the nerves of the spinothalamic tract; physical pain is no longer felt at the cost of tactile sensation. This loss of sensory input gives him enhanced strength due to adrenal overload and keeps his injuries from incapacitating him, but also mentally destabilizes him. After waking up from a coma, Westlake escapes from the hospital. Believed dead by Julie, Westlake re-establishes his lab in a condemned building and begins a long process of digitization to create a mask of his original face. Westlake uses the time to plot revenge against Durant and his men; he kills Durant's henchman Rick by putting his head in front of the incoming car after forcing him to reveal the identities of the other men, then studies them to subdue and impersonate them (having a talent for impressionism). When his face mask is complete, Westlake manages to convince Julie that he was in a coma rather than dead. He mentions that he is aware of Julie seeing Strack after his supposed death; she responds that Strack only comforted her. Keeping his disfigurement from her, Westlake instead probes whether or not she would accept him, regardless of his appearance. Westlake sows dissension and confusion among Durant's henchmen by assuming their identities. On a date at a carnival with Julie, an altercation causes Westlake to lose his temper, revealing to Julie that something is wrong with him. He flees as his face begins to melt, and she follows him, discovering the discarded mask; she calls to Peyton that she still loves him regardless. Julie tells Strack she can no longer see him before discovering the stolen Memorandum on his desk, confirming he was collaborating with Durant the entire time. She reveals Westlake is still alive, but Strack tells her as long as he has the memorandum, no charges can be filed. When Julie leaves, Durant enters and is told to capture Julie and kill Westlake. Durant intercepts Julie, kidnapping her before attacking Westlake's lair. Two of his men enter the lab to locate and kill Westlake, but are outmaneuvered and eliminated. Durant flees in a helicopter with Westlake dangling from an attached cable, which he uses to crash the helicopter. Impersonating Durant, Westlake meets up with Strack and a captive Julie at the top of an unfinished building. Westlake's ruse is broken by Strack and they fight; Westlake eventually gains the upper hand and dangles Strack by his ankle in the air. Strack says that killing him would not be something he could live with. Westlake drops Strack, remarking: \\"I'm learning to live with a lot of things.\\" Julie tries to convince Westlake that he can still return to his old life, but he tells her he has changed on the inside as well, and cannot subject anyone to his new, vicious nature. He rushes from Julie as they exit an elevator, pulling on a mask and running into a crowd of pedestrians. As Julie unsuccessfully searches for him, Westlake watches her for a few moments before turning and walking away, narrating, \\"I am everyone and no one. Everywhere. Nowhere. Call me ... Darkman.\\" Cast Liam Neeson as Peyton Westlake / Darkman, a brilliant scientist who was left for dead and burned alive as he returns to seek revenge on those who made him what he is. Initially, Raimi's longtime friend and collaborator Bruce Campbell was set to play Darkman, but the studio balked at the idea because they did not think Campbell could carry the role. Gary Oldman and Bill Paxton were also considered before Liam Neeson was cast. For the role, Raimi was looking for someone who could suggest \\"a monster with the soul of a man, and I needed an actor who could do that beneath a lot of makeup\\" and liked Neeson's \\"old Gary Cooper charisma.\\" The actor was drawn to the operatic nature of the story and the inner turmoil of his character. To research for the role, Neeson contacted the Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors, an organization that supports the emotional and social healing of burn survivors. * Frances McDormand as Julie Hastings, an attorney and Peyton's love interest. Raimi had wanted to work with Frances McDormand but the studio resisted this notion and almost cast Julia Roberts before Pretty Woman made her a star. At one point, they wanted Demi Moore for the role. The director even tested Bridget Fonda but felt that she was too young for Neeson. McDormand described the character saying \\"This is the first bimbo I've played\\".Text only copy * Colin Friels as Louis Strack Jr., a corrupt and haughty billionaire developer who runs Strack Industries. He bribes members of the city zoning commission to further his ambitious construction project (which he dubs the \\"City of the Future\\"), and employs Durant and his mobsters to eliminate anyone who gets in his way, even his own wife. He and Darkman have their final battle atop one of Strack's half-finished skyscrapers at the film's climax. * Larry Drake as Robert G. Durant, a ruthless and sadistic mob boss who works under the payroll of Strack. He auditioned for the film and Raimi liked the way he underplayed the character, \\"quiet and careful, yet intense,\\" the actor remembers. The director had never seen L.A. Law but found that Drake's face reminded him of \\"a modern day Edward G. Robinson. He looked so mean, so domineering, yet he had this urban wit about him. I thought, 'My God, this guy is not only threatening-looking, he has a good physical presence ‚Äì what a perfect adversary for the Darkman!'\\" * Nelson Mashita as Yakitito, lab assistant to Peyton Westlake * Ted Raimi as Ricky, Robert G. Durant's henchman: an unassuming-looking man, treated more like a friend or protege by Durant. * Nicholas Worth as Pauly, Robert G. Durant's henchman: a stocky, physically imposing man; he has a shaved head and a small tattoo of a dagger (and a single drop of blood) on the right side. * Dan Hicks as Skip: his left leg is false (making it ideal for concealing weapons); He's last seen during the attack on Darkman's lair- while abducting Julie- and doesn't appear for the duration of the film. * Jessie Lawrence Ferguson as Eddie Black: a rival crime boss, dispatched by Durant. * Rafael H. Robledo as Rudy Guzman * Bridget Hoffman as Computer Voice In addition, Bruce Campbell has a cameo in the film as Peyton's last seen disguise (credited as \\"Final Shemp\\"). Raimi's brother Ivan and director John Landis have cameos as hospital staff, while Jenny Agutter has an uncredited cameo as the doctor treating Westlake's burns. Production =Development and origins= For a long time, Sam Raimi had been interested in adapting a comic book into a film. He had pursued and failed to secure the rights to both The Shadow and Batman and decided to create his own. The initial idea Raimi had for Darkman was of a man who could change his face. He has said that he drew inspiration from those films as well as The Phantom of the Opera and The Elephant Man. Raimi was also inspired by the Universal horror films of the 1930s and 1940s because \\"they made me fear the hideous nature of the hero and at the same time drew me to him. I went back to that idea of the man who is noble and turns into a monster\\". He originally wrote a 30-page short story, titled \\"The Darkman\\", and then developed into a 40-page treatment. At this point, according to Raimi, \\"it became the story of a man who had lost his face and had to take on other faces, a man who battled criminals using this power\\". It also became more of a tragic love story in the tradition of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. In 1987, Raimi submitted the treatment to Universal Pictures which they liked, green- lighted a budget in the range of $8‚Äì12 million, and suggested that he get a screenwriter to flesh out the story. =Writing= Screenwriter Joshua Goldin. The more Raimi worked, the more Darkman became a crime-fighting figure, \\"a non-superpowered man who, here, is a hideous thing who fights crime. As he became that hideous thing, it became more like The Phantom of the Opera, the creature who wants the girl but who was too much of a beast to have her,\\" Raimi said. The process of developing his treatment into a screenplay was difficult with Raimi hiring ex-Navy SEAL Chuck Pfarrer based on his work on Navy SEALs. He wrote the first draft and then Raimi's brother, Ivan (a doctor), wrote drafts two through four with Sam. Ivan made sure that the medical aspects and scientific elements were authentic as possible given the nature of the story. As Raimi and his producing partner Robert Tapert progressed through various drafts, they realized that there was a potential franchise on their hands. Universal brought in screenwriting brothers Daniel and Joshua Goldin to work on the script. According to Daniel, they were presented with various drafts and \\"lots of little story documents. There was just material everywhere; drafts seemed to go in many directions.\\" Goldin said that they \\"spent a lot of time talking and pulling together a way of making the story work. I think that mostly we talked in terms of the nuts and bolts of the story.\\" The Goldins added new lines of dialogue, new characters and bits of action. The studio still wasn't satisfied so the Raimi brothers wrote drafts six through twelve before they had a shooting script. For Raimi, he wanted to emphasize Peyton/Darkman's arc over the course of the film. He said, \\"I decided to explore a man's soul. In the beginning, a sympathetic, sincere man. In the middle, a vengeful man committing heinous acts against his enemies. And in the end, a man full of self-hatred for what he's become, who must drift off into the night, into a world apart from everyone he knows and all the things he loves.\\" =Pre-production= Working with Universal meant a significant increase in budget for Raimi. This allowed him to design and build a laboratory set for Darkman and afford helicopters and professional stuntmen to film the climactic helicopter chase through the city. He was eventually given $16 million to work with, including a longer schedule and much more effects work. Visually, the filmmaker was interested in paying homage to Universal horror films of the 1930s. Production designer Randy Ser remarked, \\"if you look at Darkman's lab that he moves into, which is an old warehouse, what was on my mind was Dr. Frankenstein. There were a number of references visually to what we were thinking about in regards to those films.\\" Raimi consciously wanted to tone down his style because of a desire to \\"get into the characters' heads and follow them as real human beings in extraordinary circumstances\\". McDormand and Neeson worked closely in rehearsals, rewriting the three love scenes they had together after he becomes Darkman. They got through these scenes, according to the actress, by depending on \\"each other's knowledge, of theater and each other.\\" =Filming= The film was shot on location in Los Angeles and Toronto, Ontario. Raimi said directing McDormand was \\"very difficult\\". Raimi said, \\"apparently I didn't know Fran as well as I thought I did ... The reason it was difficult was that our conception of the best movie to make differed, arguing in trying to make the best picture possible. We did come across disagreements, but they were very healthy.\\" Durant's finger collection developed over the Pfarrer and Raimi brothers drafts. The director wanted a specific trademark for the character ‚Äì one that hinted at a military background. Neeson worked in ten-piece prosthetic makeup, sometimes for 18 hours. He saw the lengthy time spent in extensive makeup as a challenge and liked \\"the idea of working behind a mask on camera, and just exploring the possibilities of what that entailed.\\" He and makeup effects designer Tony Gardner did tests using specific glues, foams, and bandage coverings. They also timed how fast they could apply the prosthetic makeup and put the costume on. Neeson worked with the costume designer on his outfit, including aspects like the cloak. The hardest part for the actor was speaking with false teeth and he ended up doing \\"a lot of work on my voice ‚Äì I didn't want the [false teeth] to move at all.\\" =Post-production= Raimi and Tapert ran into conflicts with the studio during post-production. The director had a problem with the editor that the studio assigned him and eight weeks into assembling the rough cut, he was not following Raimi's storyboards. The editor had a nervous breakdown and left. Early preview screenings did not go well as people laughed in the wrong places and complained about a lack of a happy ending. Universal told Raimi that some people rated Darkman the worst film they had ever seen. According to executives, the film was one of the worst- scoring pictures in Universal's history. Then, two preview screenings, one with Danny Elfman's score, went well. Tapert remembers, \\"the experience on Darkman was very difficult for Sam and me; it isn't the picture we thought it should be, based on the footage we shot and all that. The studio got nervous about some kind of wild things in it, and made us take them out, which was unfortunate.\\" Raimi did like the \\"brilliant\\" marketing campaign that the studio came up with, releasing posters in advance with a silhouette of the main character and the question, \\"Who is Darkman?\\" According to the director, \\"the marketing made the film a money-maker.\\" Music =Soundtrack= Released on August 17, 1990, the soundtrack to Darkman was composed by Danny Elfman, who previously scored the music to Tim Burton's Batman in 1989. On January 28, 2020, La-La Land Records has released an expanded soundtrack album, featuring over 30 minutes of previously unreleased music. In 2017, Waxwork Records released the soundtrack on vinyl which was remastered from the original tapes. Elfman said of his score, \\"Again old-fashioned and melodramatic, but in a way that I'm crazy about. Sam Raimi has a wonderful visual style that lends itself easily to music. It was an enormous relief writing long, extended musical sequences, something which is very rare in modern films. No reason to hold back on this one.\\" # \\"Main Titles\\" ‚Äì 1:37 # \\"Woe, the Darkman ...

Universal VP of Media Vic Fondrk said that the studio did not want to spend much money promoting the film in advance, \\"but we wanted to create some intrigue for the Darkman character.\\" =Box office= On its opening weekend, Darkman grossed a total of $8 million in 1,786 theaters. To date, the film has grossed a total of $48.8 million worldwide. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 84% based on reviews from 61 critics. The site's consensus states: \\"Gruesome and deliciously broad, Sam Raimi's Darkman bears the haunted soulfulness of gothic tragedy while packing the stylistic verve of onomatopoeia springing off a comic strip page.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 65% based on reviews from 15 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Los Angeles Times film critic Michael Wilmington felt that Darkman was the only film at the time \\"that successfully captures the graphic look, rhythm and style of the superhero books.\\" Terrence Rafferty of The New Yorker said, \\"Raimi works from inside the cheerfully violent adolescent-male sensibility of superhero comics, as if there were no higher style for a filmmaker to aspire to, and the absence of condescension is refreshing.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: \\"Raimi's live-action comic book aims to deliver scares spiked with laughs. That it does.\\" USA Today gave the film three out of four stars, and wrote: \\"With good leads and a few bucks, he's come up with a high-octane revenge piece mentionable in the same breath as its predecessors.\\" Richard Corliss in Time said \\"Raimi isn't effective with his actors, and the dialogue lacks smart menace, but his canny visual sense carries many a scene.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \\"B\\" rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, \\"The movie is full of jaunty, Grand Guignol touches (the main gangster enjoys snapping and collecting fingers), but Raimi's images also have a spectral, kinetic beauty.\\" In his review for the Washington Post, Joe Brown wrote, \\"Though Raimi seems to be trying to restrain himself, his giddily sick sense of humor still pops out all over the place ‚Äì Darkman is a frenetic funhouse ride that has you laughing and screaming at the same time.\\" Rita Kempley also of the Washington Post called it \\"A fiendishly stylish journey that links the classics of transfiguration to the terrors of our times.\\" On the TV program At the Movies, Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the film \\"two thumbs up\\". Both remarked at how original and stylised Raimi's sense of direction was, with Siskel adding that Darkman as a character was \\"interesting\\". Ian Nathan of Empire magazine said the film was \\"Certainly not Raimi at his best, but some knowing genre nods and an array of great effects make up much of the deficit. Peoples Ralph Novak called Darkman, a \\"loud, sadistic, stupidly written, wretchedly acted film.\\" Darkman was singled out for notice by comic-book writer Peter David in the Comics Buyer's Guide as \\"The Perfect Super-Hero Film of All Time,\\" although this assessment was based upon other features of the film than general quality. The A.V. Club called Darkman a key transitional film, bridging from Burton's Batman films, while forging its own dark path to the future. Home media =DVD= In 1998, Darkman was released on DVD. Bonus material included production notes, cast & crew bios, and a trailer. In 1999, The Return of Durant was released on DVD. Bonus material included production notes, cast & crew bios, a trailer, and web links. In 2004, Die, Darkman, Die was released on DVD as part of the \\"Universal Studio Selections\\". The DVD contained no bonus material or even a main menu (although there were chapter selections). On August 7, 2007, all three Darkman films were released in a box set by Universal Studios. Each is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen, along with an English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround track. No extra material was included. The high definition version of Darkman was released on HD DVD July 31, 2007. =Blu-ray= A Blu-ray Disc edition of the first film was released on June 16, 2010. Shout! Factory released a second Blu-ray edition on February 18, 2014. Other media Darkman has been the subject of two Marvel Comics series (one a movie adaptation, the other an original sequel), numerous novels, as well as a video game published by Ocean Software, Darkman (1991). Tony Gardner's company Alterian, Inc. produced two different Halloween masks of the Darkman character after the film was released. Merchandising for the character all but disappeared for close to a decade until SOTA Toys obtained the rights to make a Darkman action figure. SOTA president Jerry Macaluso was interviewed by Dread Central: In 2005, SOTA produced two versions of their Darkman action figure (including interchangeable head and hands to allow the figure to be either bandaged or revealing his scarred visage), as well as a Darkman statue. Dynamite Entertainment announced in 2006 that it had reached an agreement with Universal Studios Consumer Products Group to produce original comics based on Darkman. A bimonthly limited series entitled Darkman vs. Army of Darkness was published from August 2006 to March 2007. In November 2007, Sideshow Collectibles put up for pre-order a 1:4 scale \\"Premium\\" Format Figure version of Darkman that would be released 3rd Quarter 2008. =Television= Universal Television financed a 30-minute television pilot based on Darkman, which was made in 1992 and was to be shown on Fox. The pilot, directed by Brian Grant, retold the origin of the character (with some alterations) and introduced several new characters. Christopher Bowen starred in the role of Peyton Westlake/Darkman, Larry Drake reprised his role of Robert G. Durant, and Kathleen York played the cop, Jenny. The origin is similar to the one in the original film as Peyton discovers his synthetic skin, is attacked and left for dead by Durant and his gang. In this version, however, Peyton is already married to Julie, and she is killed in the explosion. As in the films, Westlake becomes Darkman, and seeks vengeance on Durant and his gang. Darkman's headquarters are in an abandoned observatory overlooking the city, and he is wanted by the police for his actions against Durant's gang. The pilot ends with some scenes from the first film (particularly of Darkman and Durant fighting) and Darkman stating that Justice will answer with a brand new face. The pilot was unaired and never got picked up. =Comic books= With release in 1990, Marvel Comics published a 3-issue adaptation of Darkman in color along with a larger black and white magazine size adaptation consisting of all three issues. In 1993, Darkman returned in a 6 issue mini-series also published by Marvel Comics. In 2006, Dynamite Entertainment published a cross over that pitted Darkman against Sam Raimi's Ash Williams of the Evil Dead/Army of Darkness franchise. =Novels= Alongside the theatrical release in 1990, Jove Books published the novel adaptation written by Randall Boyll. In 1994, Boyll returned to expand upon the adventures of Darkman in a four-novel miniseries from Pocket Books. Over Pocket Books' four novels (The Hangman, The Price of Fear, The Gods of Hell, and In the Face of Death) Boyll further develops Darkman's character and how he deals with his new existence as an outcast individual with the ability to help others. Sequels There were two direct-to-video sequels, Darkman II: The Return of Durant (1995) and Darkman III: Die Darkman Die (1996).

Sweep is a grey glove puppet dog with long black ears who joined The Sooty Show in 1957, as a friend to fellow puppet Sooty. His general dim-witted behaviour and penchant for bones and sausages has made him an endearing, entertaining character that children still love to this day. Probably his most unusual characteristic is his method of communication. It consists of a loud high pitched squeak that gains its inflection from normal speech and its rhythm from the syllables in each word. The rest of the cast (namely Soo and the presenter) could understand Sweep perfectly, and would (albeit indirectly) translate for the viewer. The original puppeteer (Harry Corbett's brother, Leslie) achieved the sound of Sweep's voice using a saxophone reed. Versions of the puppet later sold as toys had an integral squeaker connected to an air bulb that was squeezed by hand. Sweep's family first appeared on the Sooty Show in an episode called Sweep's Family. He has his mother and father, a twin brother Swoop, two cousins Swipe and Swap and another seven brothers in the litter (all of whom look exactly like him, except that they each wear different coloured collars to tell each other apart). However Swipe and Swap are stated to be Sweep's brothers in the Sooty Heights episode the Hounds of Music.

Role in Sumerian literature Aratta is described as follows in Sumerian literature: *It is a fabulously wealthy place full of gold, silver, lapis lazuli and other precious materials, as well as the artisans to craft them.Cohen (1973) p. 55 notes: \\"Aratta became a epithet for \\"abundance\\" and \\"glory\\".\\" *It is remote and difficult to reach. *It is home to the goddess Inana, who transfers her allegiance from Aratta to Uruk. *It is conquered by Enmerkar of Uruk. Mentions in Sumerian literature Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta  The goddess Inanna resides in Aratta, but Enmerkar of Uruk pleases her more than does the lord of Aratta, who is not named in this epic. Enmerkar wants Aratta to submit to Uruk, bring stones down from the mountain, craft gold, silver and lapis lazuli, and send them, along with \\"kugmea\\" ore to Uruk to build a temple. Inana bids him send a messenger to Aratta, who ascends and descends the \\"Zubi\\" mountains, and crosses Susa, Anshan, and \\"five, six, seven\\" mountains before approaching Aratta. Aratta in turn wants grain in exchange. However Inana transfers her allegiance to Uruk, and the grain gains the favor of Aratta's people for Uruk, so the lord of Aratta challenges Enmerkar to send a champion to fight his champion. Then the god Ishkur makes Aratta's crops grow. Enmerkar and En-suhgir-ana  The lord of Aratta, who is here named En-suhgir-ana (or Ensuhkeshdanna), challenges Enmerkar of Uruk to submit to him over the affections of Inanna, but he is rebuffed by Enmerkar. A sorcerer from the recently defeated Hamazi then arrives in Aratta, and offers to make Uruk submit. The sorcerer travels to Eresh where he bewitches Enmerkar's livestock, but a wise woman outperforms his magic and casts him into the Euphrates; En-suhgir-ana then admits the loss of Inanna, and submits his kingdom to Uruk. Lugalbanda in the Mountain Cave  is a tale of Lugalbanda, who will become Enmerkar's successor. Enmerkar's army travels through mountainous territory to wage war against rebellious Aratta. Lugalbanda falls ill and is left in a cave, but he prays to the various gods, recovers, and must find his way out of the mountains. Lugalbanda and the Anzud Bird  Lugalbanda befriends the Anzud bird, and asks it to help him find his army again. When Enmerkar's army is faced with setback, Lugalbanda volunteers to return to Uruk to ask the goddess Inana's aid. He crosses through the mountains, into the flat land, from the edge to the top of Anshan and then to Uruk, where Inana helps him. She advises Enmerkar to carry off Aratta's \\"worked metal and metalsmiths and worked stone and stonemasons\\" and all the \\"moulds of Aratta will be his\\". Then the city is described as having battlements made of green lapis lazuli and bricks made of \\"tinstone dug out in the mountains where the cypress grows\\". =Other mentions in Sumerian literature=Praise Poem of Shulgi (Shulgi Y): \\"I filled it with treasures like those of holy Aratta.\\" *Shulgi and Ninlil's barge: \\"Aratta, full-laden with treasures\\" *Proverbs: \\"When the authorities are wise, and the poor are loyal, it is the effect of the blessing of Aratta.\\" *Unprovenanced Proverbs: \\"When the authorities are wise, and the poor are passed by, it is the effect of the blessing of Aratta.\\" *Hymn to Hendursanga (Hendursanga A): \\"So that Aratta will be overwhelmed (?), Lugalbanda stands by at your (Hendursanga's) behest.\\" *Hymn to Nisaba (Nisaba A): \\"In Aratta he (Enki?) has placed E-zagin (the lapis lazuli temple) at her (Nisaba's) disposal.\\" *The building of Ninngirsu's temple (Gudea cylinder): \\"pure like Kesh and Aratta\\" *Tigi to Suen (Nanna I) : \\"the shrine of my heart which I (Nanna) have founded in joy like Aratta\\" *Inana and Ibeh: \\"the inaccessible mountain range Aratta\\" *Gilgamesh and Huwawa (Version B): \\"they know the way even to Aratta\\" *Temple Hymns: Aratta is \\"respected\\" *The Kesh Temple Hymn: Aratta is\\"important\\" *Lament for Ur: Aratta is \\"weighty (counsel)\\" Location hypotheses Early 20th century scholars initially took Aratta to be an epithet of the Sumerian city Shuruppak related to its local name for the god Enlil;Langdom, Stephen H. \\"Early Babylonia and its Cities .\\" Cambridge Ancient History. Accessed 19 Dec 2010. however that is no longer seen to be the case. Although Aratta is known only from myth,Cohen (1973) p. 61. Cohen states: \\"it is indeed strange that the name of such an important trade center should as yet remain unknown to us from any economic, administrative or other non-literary texts from the Ur III or Old Babylonian period\\". some Assyriologists and archaeologists have speculated on possible locations where Aratta could have been, using criteria from the myths:Kramer (1963), Gordon (1967) and Cohen (1973)Herrmann (1968), Hansman (1972, 1978) and Majidzadeh (1976) # Land travelers must pass through Susa and the mountainous Anshan region to reach it. # It is a source of, or has access to valuable gems and minerals, in particular lapis lazuli, that are crafted on site. # It is accessible to Uruk by watercourse, yet remote from Uruk. # It is close enough to march a 27th-century BC Sumerian army there. In 1963, Samuel Noah Kramer thought that a \\"Mount Hurum\\" in a Lugalbanda myth (which he titled \\"Lugalbanda on Mount Hurrum\\" at the time) might have referred to the Hurrians, and hence speculated Aratta to be near Lake Urmia.Kramer (1963) p. 275. However, \\"Mount Hurum\\", \\"hur-ru-um kur-ra-ka\\", in what is now called Lugalbanda in the Mountain Cave,] is today read \\"mountain cave\\",see e.g. Lugalbanda in the Mountain Cave, ETCSL (2006) line 102, etc.; Reallexikon der Assyriologie und Vorderasiatischen Arch√§ologie (1990) vol. 7, p. 121; Black (1998) p. 136; Vanstiphout (2003) p.110-111, etc. and Kramer subsequently introduced the title \\"Lugalbanda, the Wandering Hero\\" for this story.Reallexikon der Assyriologie und Vorderasiatischen Arch√§ologie (1990) vol. 7, p. 121 Other speculations referred to the early gem trade route, the \\"Great Khorasan Road\\" from the Himalayan MountainsThe only source of lapis lazuli for the ancient world was Badakhshan, Afghanistan (see Clark (1986) p. 67). to Mesopotamia, which ran through northern Iran.Gordon (1967) p. 72, note 9.

Cohen also notes that the farthest east that any Assyrian king ever went was Hamadan. Nevertheless, there have been speculations referring to eastern Iran as well.Hansman, John F. (1972, 1978). Shahr-i Sokhta.Majidzadeh (1976) Shahdad; (2004) Jiroft. Dr. Yousef Majidzadeh believes the Jiroft culture could be Aratta. By 1973, archaeologists were noting that there was no archaeological record of Aratta's existence outside of myth, and in 1978 Hansman cautions against over-speculation.Hansman (1978): \\"In the case of Aratta, where no inscriptions or texts are currently available to favor any one site, the mechanics of identification depend largely on inductive inquiry. At best such methods provide indications from which a location may be postulated as being reasonable or possible. But one cannot assume too much, for then the hypothesis becomes subjective rather than objective.\\" Writers in other fields have continued to hypothesize potential Aratta locations.

Seland attended Stend Agricultural School (1884‚Äì1886). He was editor in Nordmands in Christiania (1893‚Äì96) and before 1896 went back to Nes to take over father's farm. He was deputy to the Parliament of Norway for the Norwegian Liberal Party (1915‚Äì18) and for the Norwegian Agrarian Association (1921‚Äì24). Locally he was a member of Nes council board and bank auditor for 30 years. Hans Seland, together with Hans Haga and Nils Tr√¶dal, were among the most influential politicians in the Agrarian Party (Norges Bondelag) to prevent this group from joining the fascist Nasjonal Samling of Vidkun Quisling.Hans Andreas Johanneson Seland (Store norske leksikon) Literary career Seland reached out to a broad audience as the author of over 50 books. Almost all literature written by or about him is only available in Norwegian, reducing a potential international audience. He may not be among Norway‚Äôs most known authors, but is certainly among the most celebrated ones within such diverse circles as Norwegian emigrants in America. His fame as a wandering storyteller eventually led him to the States in 1904, where he visited several of the Norwegian immigrant communities which had grown up after the great migration from Norway. In 1925, he represented the Norwegian Farmers' Union at the Norse-American Centennial, the 100th anniversary of Norwegian emigration to America.The Struggle Over Norwegian (Einar Haugen. Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume XVII, page 1) He writes in his autobiography Aar og Dagar how stunned he was to see how faithfully the Norwegian immigrants had preserved their dialects and the formal church language, and at the same time successfully accommodated to the American way of living. His travels inspired him to write several complimentary articles of the United States and the preservation of Norwegian history, literature, and culture in general among the emigrants living there. His fame led him to meet with President Theodore Roosevelt. Seland chose to write in his native tongue, Nynorsk, at a time when most Norwegian authors still hung on to the Danish-inspired Bokm√•l. This and the quality of his writings, led him to the friendship with several other combatants of the new language, including such well-known authors as Ivar Aasen, Aasmund Olavsson Vinje, Arne Garborg, Jonas Lie, and Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson . Seland was, above all, a humorist. Many of his books are in a genre that may be called stubs of fun, or in his own words; Morostubbar. They consist of many small humorous stories, the normal ones averaging about 1-2 pages each. These he wrote out of his own imagination, or based them on actual situations experienced on his travels. He traveled all around telling his tales, and was a frequent and popular voice on the radio of his days. Among the Norwegian comedians of the pre-war era, Seland would be counted among the greatest. As Norway sought independence from the Kingdom of Sweden, Seland in 1904 gave out his book Prinsesse Gullsko og systerne hennar. As all adults were discussing how to find a peaceful solution to end the union with Sweden, Seland thought of the children. His book was a welcome breath of childish fun and imagination to the lives of thousands, and by using New Norwegian he reached a broader audience as the children finally got to read stories in their own dialect, as New Norwegian were, and still is, spoken by most Norwegians. He published several more books for children, and by 1908 he was involved in creating schoolbooks teaching children how to read in the new language. Illustrations to his books were by the noted artist Theodor Kittelsen among others. Selected works I straumen (1892) * Hikstorier (1893) * Andror (1898) * Eikeli (1900) * Norskt maal.

Furthermore, it is assumed that they are two entities. The paradox arises because it rests on two incompatible premises‚Äîthat there can exist simultaneously such things as unstoppable forces and immovable objects. The \\"paradox\\" is flawed because if there exists an unstoppable force, it follows logically that there cannot be any such thing as an immovable object and vice versa. : Also available as  Origins  An example of this paradox in non-western thought can be found in the origin of the Chinese word for contradiction (). This term originates from a story in the 3rd century BC philosophical book Han Feizi.Han Feizi (ÈüìÈùûÂ≠ê), chapter 36, Nanyi (Èõ£‰∏Ä \\"Collection of Difficulties, No. 1\\")'. In the story, a man was trying to sell a spear and a shield. When asked how good his spear was, he said that his spear could pierce any shield. Then, when asked how good his shield was, he said that it could defend from all spear attacks. Then one person asked him what would happen if he were to take his spear to strike his shield; the seller could not answer. This led to the idiom of \\"z√¨xƒ´ang m√°od√πn\\" (Ëá™Áõ∏ÁüõÁõæ, \\"from each-other spear shield\\"), or \\"self-contradictory\\". Another ancient example illustrating this theme can be found in the story of the Teumessian fox, who can never be caught, and the hound Laelaps, who never misses what it hunts. Realizing the paradox, Zeus turns both creatures into static stars.  Applications  The problems associated with this paradox can be applied to any other conflict between two abstractly defined extremes that are opposite. One of the answers generated by seeming paradoxes like these is that there is no contradiction ‚Äì that there is a false dilemma. Dr. Christopher Kaczor suggested that the need to change indicates a lack of power rather than the possession thereof, and as such a person who was omniscient would never need to change their mind ‚Äì not changing the future would be consistent with omniscience rather than contradicting it.Kaczor, Christopher (2009). This Rock, 20(3). Cultural references In Iain Banks's novel, Walking on Glass, a solution to the paradox is given. The 2005 video game Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney retells the story of the spear and shield from Han Feizi during its fifth case. A \\"King of Prosecutors\\" trophy that homages the story, depicting a cracked shield and a broken halberd, becomes an important piece of evidence during the case's events.

He started his broadcasting with a 3-year stint at Bailrigg FM, known at that time as University Radio Bailrigg (URB), whilst studying for a BA Hons in Economics at Lancaster University. He was firstly Treasurer and then became President of URB. Early career Allinson was born in Lichfield, Staffordshire. He attended Tudor Grange Grammar School for Boys in Solihull. He rejected a career in the legal profession and, in August 1980, took up broadcasting on London's Capital Radio, presenting their Chart Show. He also presented the Early Breakfast show for some of this period. Following on from Capital's Chart Show, in 1984 he took over the late-night 10pmmidnight slot. In 1987 he took over the weekday 24:30pm slot, followed by the weekday Early Breakfast show 46:30am in 1990. In addition to this, in around 1994 he worked alongside Julia Carling on the satellite music television channel VH1, where they hosted a live show together. Radio 2 Allinson joined BBC Radio 2 in 1997, presenting the MondayThursday late night show from 10:30pm to midnight, which included a mix of music and guests. In early 1999, Allinson took over the weekday drivetime show from 5pm to 7pm whilst regular presenter Johnnie Walker was off air due to health-related issues. He presented the programme for several months, with Lynn Parsons taking over the late show; in December 1999, Allinson returned to the late night show. In addition to his late night show, in 2000, Allinson also took over a Saturday afternoon show from 3:30 to 6:30pm, where he introduced the 'Radio Wall Of Sound'. This was where listeners could ring in, listen to a selection of snippets of tunes until they liked one particularly, for it to play as quickly as they'd shouted 'play' or made some other noise dictated by the host after the caller had been probed about their life. They were rewarded with a CD album of their choice. Allinson stepped down from the late night slot in June 2004, so he could concentrate on fronting Radio 2's 'Live & Exclusive' series and 'Sold on Song' projects. With record producer Steve Levine he formed Magnum Opus Broadcasting to \\"create programming and content we wanted to hear ‚Äì but could not find ‚Äì on the radio. Alongside this, he still continued with his Saturday afternoon show, which was cut down to 2 hours in September 2004 and went out from 4 to 6pm every Saturday. It was also during this period that he became the main stand-in for many weekday presenters when taking their holidays, such as Chris Evans, Simon Mayo, Paul O'Grady, Terry Wogan, Ken Bruce, Sarah Kennedy and Steve Wright. His Saturday show eventually ended in September 2005, but he still continued to stand in for weekday presenters on Radio 2 as well as create and present documentaries and specialist shows for the network, such as The Record Producers, which is usually broadcast from 7 to 8pm on Bank Holiday Mondays. On Sunday 24 August 2008 Allinson hosted London 2012 Party Live on BBC Radio 2 from The Mall outside Buckingham Palace in London which included the 2008 Beijing Olympics handover musical celebrations. BBC Local Radio From 8 January 2006 until 24 February 2007, Allinson presented a regular weekly show on BBC Radio Oxford on Sunday mornings from 9am to 12 noon. The show included a mix of music, guests, competitions and a look at headlines from the Sunday papers. Since January 2007, he has presented the two-hour live show Allinson's Albums between 12 and 2pm every Saturday on BBC Radio Oxford, and from 4 March 2007 is repeated on Sundays from 5 to 7pm (these are no longer broadcast). The show was also broadcast on BBC Radio York on Saturday lunchtimes from 1 to 3pm, and on BBC Radio Cumbria each Wednesday evening, repeated on Sunday afternoons; the last edition of this was broadcast on 6 January 2013. Other work Allinson has been heard on the various BFBS (British Forces) radio networks since 1980, first on Most Wanted for BFBS Radio 1, where he played mostly new music with a cutting edge, later moving to BFBS UK and others, and moved to BFBS Radio 2 in 2003 presenting in a style which the public have grown accustomed to with his shows on BBC Radio 2. From October 2006 he took over a daily show for the network, going out Mondays-Fridays from 9 to 11am UK time, which he presented until March 2008. Richard has also been known to present shows on the BBC World Service. Return to Radio 2 From 2009, Allinson returned to BBC Radio 2 on a regular basis, presenting the weekend overnight slots, replacing Pete Mitchell and Mo Dutta's slots. The show went out on Friday nights/Saturday mornings and Saturday nights/Sunday mornings from 3 to 6am and was produced by production company Somethin' Else. He also presented an occasional series called The Record Producers, which went out on Bank Holiday Mondays. In October 2014 his weekend show was cancelled due to budget cuts at Radio 2.http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/richard-allinson- radio-2-show-ends-bob-harris-moves-slot/058627 He hasn't done any cover work for Radio 2 since moving to Magic 105.4.

It is made of up two main continents on the world of Draia: Seridia and Irilion. Seridia is the first continent, and the place in which new players spawn. It consists of 14 main maps, seven storages, two main PK (player kill) maps, and the only spot to find the Wraith, who can provide various benefits to players in exchange for \\"pickpoints\\". = Character building = Players begin play by selecting the race, name and appearance of their character. Skills, abilities and alignments are automatically given initial values. There are six races available: Humans, elves, dwarves, Humans bleus, and elves black.Playable races on Eternal Lands' official website The last three races are pay-to-play races; a player must pay money to play a character of one of these races. Eternal Lands does not have fixed character classes, and it is possible for any player to improve any of the 12 skills in the game.Skills overview on Eternal Lands' official website  System requirements  A computer with a 3D-accelerated graphics card and an internet connection is needed to play Eternal Lands. Eternal Lands supports the Microsoft Windows, Android, Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X operating systems and the X86, X86_64, IA64 and PowerPC architectures. An Android version is also available, so the game can be run on almost all Android devices such as smart phones, TV Android boxes, and so on. The software download is free.  In-game activities  In-game activities include exploring the 39 different outside maps (plus numerous insides and caves), questing, socializing with other players, player killing, and improving skills by fighting, gathering resources and creating items. All skills increase the \\"overall\\" experience, rewarding players with \\"pickpoints\\", with which they can further build their characters. = Productive skills = The productive skills are called alchemy, crafting, magic, manufacturing, potion making, and tailoring. The items can be created by inserting certain materials into the manufacturing window and attempting to mix them. If mixing fails, the materials may be lost. Success chance is defined by skill level and the item's level. If the player succeeds, the item appears in their inventory and they will receive experience. = Harvesting = Harvesting involves the gathering of resources, such as flowers, minerals and ores. These items can be used for creating items or be sold to NPCs or other players. Harvesting some materials requires different tools. = Combat = Fighting is broken into attack and defense skills, which the player can improve by fighting monsters or players. For every successful hit landed on the opponent, attack experience is gained, and dodging a hit gives defense experience. The amount of experience is determined by the level differences between the fighting players. It is also possible to fight with the magic, ranging and summoning skills. Ranging experience is obtained by hitting opponent with an arrow or bolt shot with one of the five different bows or crossbows. Summoning experience is obtained by successfully summoning a creature and magic experience by casting spells. Both summons and spells require certain materials that will disappear upon succeeding.  Player killing  On the main Eternal Lands server, there are only a few select areas where players can attack one another, so that players don't have to engage in player versus player combat if they don't want to. However, there is also a pay-to-play PK serverPK server introduction on Eternal Lands' official forums which allows for players to fight each other nearly anywhere. It has been out for quite some time now but is still not very populated.  Development  The game client is open-source under a modified Q Public License and may be developed by anyone.License of Eternal Lands source code on GitHub \\"The Eternal Lands license is a slightly modified QTPL license\\" However, the license does require modified clients to be approved by administrators before it is possible to connect with the main servers.

According to the , it has a population of people. Panabo is part of Davao Metropolitan Area as it shares borders with Davao City. It has an area of . The Panabo City Hall is located about 2.23 kilometers from its boundary with Davao City. Etymology The name Panabo originated from the phrase \\"pana-sa-boboy\\" where \\"pana\\" means \\"arrow\\", the tool which the original inhabitants of the place, the Aetas, use when hunting wild animals for food. History Originally the rich lowland of what today is Panabo was inhabited by a group of stocky-haired natives called Aetas. These people led nomadic life and lived by hunting. With the use of their most essential tool, the bow and arrow‚Äî\\"pana-sa-boboy\\" as they call it‚Äîthey hunted for food which primarily consisted of rootcrops and meat of wild boars. Settlers and pioneers from the Visayas and Luzon started to flock the place during the early 1900s in search of a new life in the region. When the first batch of settlers arrived on the place, in what is now the urban core of the city, they found out that it was already a thriving community, and thus called it Taboan, or trading center. Feeling alienated with the massive influx of settlers in the region, the Aeta natives moved further into the hinterlands to the west, thus ensuring that the settler inhabitants become the majority of the population. The new inhabitants started to name the place as Panabo, named after the bow and arrow that the Aeta natives always carry. Panabo, until then only a mere barangay of Tagum, then known as Magugpo during that time, became a town on 19 July 1949, through Presidential Proclamation No. 236 of the President Manuel A. Roxas. The Tagum Agricultural Development Company, otherwise known as TADECO, was founded on 20 December 1950 in the town of Panabo. It was the birth of the world's largest Cavendish banana plantation that saw the mass employment of the locals seeking for jobs, and the start of unprecedented growth of the town as even larger throngs of Visayan migrants settled on the town eager to join the plantation's workforce. Large areas of forests were cleared to make way for the banana trees under TADECO. The town of Panabo grew both in economic terms and population as decades passed since the founding of TADECO and numerous businesses were then set up locally, until the conditions finally warranted for its conversion into a city. The local government unit of Panabo was created into a component city of Davao del Norte by virtue of Republic Act No. 9015 and ratified by the residents in a plebiscite held on March 31, 2001. However, its official existence as a municipal corporation took effect on with the appointment of new set of officials. Geography The city of Panabo has a total land area of 251.23 km2. It was bordered by the shores of Davao Gulf to the east, by Davao City to its west and south, and some of the municipalities of Davao del Norte in the north. The western part of the city featured hills while the rest were flatlands. =Barangays= The city is politically subdivided into 40 barangays. Quezon was formerly the sitio of Cabili; it became a barrio in 1957. =Climate= Demographics Economy Banana plantations in Panabo Being an agro-industrial city, Panabo is known as the \\"Banana Capital of the Philippines\\" due to numerous banana plantations scattered throughout the city. In fact, Panabo is the home of the world's biggest banana plantation, which is owned by the Tagum Agricultural Development Company (TADECO), which covers around 6,900 hectares of banana fields and produce millions of boxes of export-quality bananas annually. The city itself cultivated 40% of its land or around 10,000 hectares into planting export-quality Cavendish bananas. Thus, banana cultivation and exportation are the main economic lifeblood of the city. Infrastructure Panabo City Hall There are two privately owned port facilities in the city, which enabled them to export various fruits, such as bananas, mangoes, papayas, and pineapples, to countries like Japan, Korea, China, and countries as far in the Middle East and the European Union. Public infrastructure includes the Freedom Park which features a unique banana inspired fountain sculpted by the world class artist Kublai Millan. The Panabo Multi-Purpose Cooperative Tourism Gymnasium, located beside the City Hall is also a public infrastructure, the gymnasium accommodates an estimated ten- thousand people and also serves as playing venue of the Philippine Basketball Association as well as serving concerts for the city. =Transportation= Panabo is served by the 6-lane Maharlika Highway and is a highway road junction heading to the TADECO banana plantation as well as to other parts of Davao del Norte and the northernmost areas of Davao City. Tricycles and jeepneys are the main mode of transportation in the city, while passenger buses and public utility vans serve overland routes within and outside the city.

It is an extremely versatile machine used to perform a variety of grinding operations: surface, cylindrical, or complex shapes. The image shows a manually operated setup, however highly automated Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines are becoming increasingly common due to the complexities involved in the process. The operation of this machine (in particular, the manually operated variety) requires a high level of skill. The two main skills needed are understanding of the relationship between the grinding wheel and the metal being cut and knowledge of tool geometry. The illustrated set-up is only one of many combinations available. The huge variety in shapes and types of machining cutters requires flexibility in usage. A variety of dedicated fixtures are included that allow cylindrical grinding operations or complex angles to be ground. The vise shown can swivel in three planes. The table moves longitudinally and laterally, the head can swivel as well as being adjustable in the horizontal plane, as visible in the first image. This flexibility in the head allows the critical clearance angles required by the various cutters to be achieved. CNC tool and cutter grinder A modern CNC tool grinder with automatic wheel pack exchanger and tool loading capabilities. Today's tool and cutter grinder is typically a CNC machine tool, usually 5 axes, which produces endmills, drills, step tools, etc. which are widely used in the metal cutting and woodworking industries. Modern CNC tool and cutter grinders enhance productivity by typically offering features such as automatic tool loading as well as the ability to support multiple grinding wheels. High levels of automation, as well as automatic in-machine tool measurement and compensation, allow extended periods of unmanned production. With careful process configuration and appropriate tool support, tolerances less than 5 micrometres (0.0002\\") can be consistently achieved even on the most complex parts. Apart from manufacturing, in-machine tool measurement using touch-probe or laser technology allows cutting tools to be reconditioned. During normal use, cutting edges either wear and/or chip. The geometric features of cutting tools can be automatically measured within the CNC tool grinder and the tool ground to return cutting surfaces to optimal condition. Significant software advancements have allowed CNC tool and cutter grinders to be utilized in a wide range of industries. Advanced CNC grinders feature sophisticated software that allows geometrically complex parts to be designed either parametrically or by using third party CAD/CAM software. 3D simulation of the entire grinding process and the finished part is possible as well as detection of any potential mechanical collisions and calculation of production time. Such features allow parts to be designed and verified, as well as the production process optimized, entirely within the software environment. Tool and cutter grinders can be adapted to manufacturing precision machine components. The machine, when used for these purposes more likely would be called a CNC Grinding System. CNC Grinding Systems are widely used to produce parts for aerospace, medical, automotive, and other industries. Extremely hard and exotic materials are generally no problem for today's grinding systems and the multi-axis machines are capable of generating quite complex geometries. Radius grinder A radius grinder (or radius tool grinder) is a special grinder used for grinding the most complex tool forms, and is the historical predecessor to the CNC tool and cutter grinder. Like the CNC grinder, it may be used for other tasks where grinding spherical surfaces is necessary. The tool itself consists of three parts: The grinder head, work table, and holding fixture. The grinder head has three degrees of freedom. Vertical movement, movement into the workpiece, and tilt. These are generally set statically, and left fixed throughout operations. The work table is a T-slotted X-axis table mounted on top of a radial fixture. Mounting the X axis on top of the radius table, as opposed to the other way around, allows for complex and accurate radius grinds. The holding fixtures can be anything one can mount on a slotted table, but most commonly used is a collet or chuck fixture that indexes and has a separate Y movement to allow accurate depth setting and endmill sharpening. The dressers used on these grinders are usually quite expensive, and can dress the grinding wheel itself with a particular radius. D-bit grinder D bit grinder The D-bit (after Deckel, the brand of the original manufacturer) grinder is a tool bit grinder designed to produce single-lip cutters for pantograph milling machines. Pantographs are a variety of milling machine used to create cavities for the dies used in the molding process; they are largely obsolete and replaced by CNC machining centers in modern industry. With the addition of accessory holders, the single-lip grinding capability may also be applied to grinding lathe cutting bits, and simple faceted profiles on tips of drill bits or end mills. The machine is sometimes advertised as a \\"universal cutter-grinder\\", but the \\"universal\\" term refers only to the range of compound angles available, not that the machine is capable of sharpening the universe of tools. The machine is not capable of sharpening drill bits in the standard profiles, or generating any convex or spiral profiles.

The compound is extremely toxic (LD50 = 70 ¬µg/kg in mice). Poisoning can cause convulsions, respiratory paralysis, and eventual death. Samandarin is also believed to be the active ingredient in Salamander brandy, a Slovenian drink with purported hallucinogenic and aphrodisiac effects. Samandarine family Nine isolated compounds in the samandarine family. Fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra). Samandarin belongs to a family of toxic compounds called samandarines. Samandarines are biologically active, lipid-soluble steroidal alkaloids. They all contain a similar 7-6-6-5 fused ring system. Nine structures in this family have been characterized. Samandarines are exclusively produced and secreted by the fire salamander through their parotoid glands (20 mg/gland). Samandarin is the main component of these poisons, although the precise ratio of the samandarine alkaloids can vary from species to species. Fire salamanders are indigenous to central Europe and reside in deciduous forests. They secrete the samandarine toxins for protection from predators. Salamander venom has been shown to be toxic to mammals, birds, fishes, and even other amphibians. It has also been suggested that samandarines prevent the salamander from contracting bacterial and fungal infections. History =Discovery= Early descriptions of salamander poisonings were found in the writings of many physicians and philosophers in the Middle Ages. Little was known about the toxic compounds, but the recorded symptoms from poisonings were consistent with what is known today. The ancient healers also had some interesting theories about how one contracted poison from the salamander. They believed that the mere sighting of the black and yellow spotted animal or ingestion of salamander ashes would lead to sickness and death. It was not until 1768 when Laurentius, a physician, discovered that the secretions from the skin glands of the salamander were the source of the poison. In 1866, Zalesky performed more studies on the toxicology of samandarines. He was able to isolate the family of alkaloids (believing they were one compound) and tested their toxicity on a variety of animals. He also found that the salamander could be poisoned by its own venom if it entered the salamander‚Äôs bloodstream. Samandarin was the first in the family of compounds to be isolated. In 1899, Faust purified samandarin as a crystalline sulfate salt by killing the salamanders with chloroform, mincing their corpses, and performing a number of acid-base extractions. In 1926, the pharmacology of samandarin was further examined by Gessner who administered the poison to animals and dissected their corpses. He determined that the poison primarily affected the central nervous system and spinal cord. Most studies on samandarin and other samandarine alkaloids were performed in the mid-1900s by German scientists Sch√∂pf and Habermehl. They were able to elucidate the structures of nine samandarines and found that samandarin was the main alkaloid in the salamander‚Äôs secretions. The structure and stereochemistry of samandarin was confirmed in 1961 using X-ray crystallography. In 1968, Habermehl and Haaf also investigated biosynthesis of samandarines with in vitro and in vivo experiments, finding that the compounds originate from a cholesterol precursor. =Use in Salamander Brandy= It is believed that the samandarine family of compounds is the active ingredient in an indigenous Slovenian drink called Salamander brandy. Salamander brandy was first brought to attention in 1995 by an article published in the Slovenian magazine Mladina, describing the hallucinogenic and intensely aphrodisiac effects of the drink. Ogorevc, the author of the article, writes about his first-hand experience of obtaining and experimenting with Salamander brandy. In the excerpt below, Ogorevc describes his intoxication with Salamander brandy: Ogorevc also reported on a few methods he observed for making Salamander brandy. One is by adding live black and yellow spotted salamanders to a barrel of fermenting fruit (one salamander for every ten liters). The mixture is then left for a couple of months while the salamander secretes its toxins (supposedly samandarines) to avoid ethanol absorption until its eventual death. Another method he describes is to hang a salamander by its hind legs under a stream of brandy during the distillation process. The salamander will excrete its poisons to defend itself while the brandy continues to wash away its secretions. A third technique is to kill and dry the salamanders and hang them above the pot of cooking fruit. The steam that rises will extract the poisonous compounds from the salamander and will then be distilled and collected in a vessel. The publication of Ogorevc‚Äôs account brought much public attention and curiosity to this enigmatic drink. Yet, the credibility of the existence of Salamander brandy as described by Ogorevc has been brought into question. Anthropologist Miha Kozorog from University of Ljubljana decided to investigate Ogorevc‚Äôs claims in 2003. Although he and his colleagues traveled to the region where Ogorevc supposedly bought Salamander brandy, Kozorog was unable to obtain any samples. However, from many discussions with the locals in that region, he learned that Salamander brandy was not a psychedelic drink as exclaimed by Ogorevc and the media but was rather a derogatory term for bad or fake brandy. The locals explain that brandy distillers who make Salamander brandy are swindlers. Those who do consume Salamander brandy, only do so accidentally and as a result, will experience paralysis in the legs (which is one of the symptoms of samandarin poisoning). Kozorog quotes ‚Äúthere are fair and good brandy distillers who cook pure and good brandy; there are also those who swindle with brandy and whose brandy is a fake one (and sometimes poisoned)‚Ä¶‚Äù Kozorog also learned of a folktale surrounding Salamander brandy. The story tells a tale of a woman who lived on a farm and often cooked a special brandy to which she added a live salamander. Those who drank her brandy were driven mad from the poison. Whenever the devil came by for a drink, the locals could hear terrible rumbling throughout their village as the devil ran around intoxicated from her concoction. In his research, Kozorog was unable to find any hard evidence of the hallucinogenic properties Ogorevc described in Salamander brandy. Considering the methods that have been described for preparing Salamander brandy, it is likely that samandarine toxins do play a role in the effects of the drink. However, the brandy is rather stigmatized among locals as adulterated brandy. Kozorog claims that the excitement surrounding the psychedelic properties of Salamander brandy was engendered mainly by Ogorevc‚Äôs humorous writing style and grandiose media coverage. Biological effects Samandarin is extremely toxic (LD50 = 70 ¬µg/kg in mice, LD50 = 700-900 ¬µg/kg in dogs) but little is known about its precise mechanism of action. Samandarin mainly affects the central nervous system, specifically the spinal cord. No treatment or antidote is known for the poison. Although samandarin has shown to have some local anesthetic effects, there are currently no therapeutic uses for samandarin. Samandarin poisoning can occur through transdermal exposure or oral ingestion. In the early stages of samandarin poisoning, there is over- excitation of the muscles ‚Äì restlessness, hypertension, rapid breathing, dilated pupils, and increased mucus and saliva. In the later stages, samandarin can cause convulsions, dyspnea, and paralysis. Death eventually occurs by respiratory paralysis after a few hours. Animals poisoned with samandarin show hemorrhaging in the internal organs. Hallucinogenic and aphrodisiac effects from samandarin ingestion have been rumored and reported by media but are largely unfounded. Synthesis Fused ring system in samandarin =By the salamander= Habermehl and Haaf have investigated the biosynthesis of samandarin with in vivo and in vitro experiments. Samandarin is synthesized from cholesterol precursors in the liver, testes, or ovaries. They found that the enlargement of ring A occurs by nitrogen insertion from a glutamine residue. The degradation of the carbon chain and hydroxylation of ring D is shown through the intermediates in the scheme below. Intermediates showing the functionalization of ring D in samandarin The carbon chain on the D ring of cholesterol is degraded by functionalizations with carboxyl groups and sequential decarboxylation reactions. A hydroxyl group is also installed on the adjacent carbon to yield samandarin. These steps are performed by enzymes in the salamander. The details of the biosynthesis have not been elucidated completely. =In the lab= The chemical synthesis of samandarin was of interest by a few groups in the 1960s and 1970s but has not been pursued in recent years. The construction of ring A was of greatest synthetic interest. Shimizu in 1976 was able to successfully construct the bridged oxazolidone system with correct stereoselectivity. The steps proceeded with low to moderate yields. The last few steps of the synthesis is shown below. Using m-chloroperobenzoic acid, an epoxide is created onto the alkene. The addition of sodium azide will facilitate the anti-Markovnikov opening of the epoxide. Reduction with sodium borohydride completes the azaheterocycle and bridged oxazolidone through either a cyclic amidine intermediate or imino ester intermediate.

He was the father of the illustrator Thoreau MacDonald. Life =Early years= MacDonald was born on 12 May 1873 in Durham, England, to an English mother, Margaret (Usher), and a Canadian father, William MacDonald, who was a cabinetmaker. In 1887 at the age of 14, he immigrated with his family to Hamilton, Ontario. That year he began his first training as an artist at the Hamilton Art School, where he studied under John Ireland and Arthur Heming. In 1889, they moved again to Toronto, where he studied commercial art and became active in the Toronto Art Student League. He continued his training at the Central Ontario School of Art and Design, where he studied with George Agnew Reid and William Cruikshank. In 1895, MacDonald took a position as a commercial designer at Grip Ltd, an important commercial art firm, where he further developed his design skills. In the coming years, he encouraged his colleagues‚Äîincluding future artist Tom Thomson‚Äîto develop their skills as painters. In 1899, MacDonald married Joan Lavis, and two years later they had a son, Thoreau. MacDonald worked as a designer at Grip Ltd until 1903, then at Carlton Studio in London from 1903 to 1907, and returned to Grip Ltd in 1907. Whilst at Carlton, he worked with Norman Mills Price, William Tracy Wallace, and Albert Angus Turbayne. =Early career as an artist= In 1911, MacDonald resigned his designer position at Grip Ltd. and moved with his wife and child to Thornhill, Ontario, to pursue a career as a landscape artist. To supplement his income, he worked occasionally as a freelance designer until 1921. After developing his own unique style as a painter, he organized a show of his work at the Arts and Letters Club of Toronto in November 1911. Fellow artist Lawren Harris‚Äîa member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts‚Äîwas so impressed with MacDonald's work that he asked if they could work together. Harris encouraged MacDonald to continue painting and show his work whenever possible. The following year they organized their first joint exhibition. In 1912, MacDonald was widely recognized for his contributions to an exhibition at the Ontario Society of Artists. In January 1913, MacDonald and Harris traveled to the Albright Art Gallery, today's Albright-Knox Gallery, in Buffalo, New York, where they attended the Exhibition of Contemporary Scandinavian Art and saw post-Impressionist and expressionist landscape paintings by artists such as Gustaf Fjaestad and Vilhelm Hammersh√∏i. The two artists felt that the approach to the northern Scandinavian wilderness could be adopted by Canadian painters to create on canvas a unique Canadian form of landscape art. Later that year, commercial artists based in Toronto began to show interest in the potential of original Canadian expression; these artists began to congregate around MacDonald and Harris. In the spring of 1913, MacDonald wrote to A. Y. Jackson, inviting him to come to Toronto, which he did in May. In March 1916, MacDonald exhibited The Tangled Garden at the Ottawa Society of Artists. Though derided by art critics of the day, it was a fairly conventional post-impressionistic painting of sunflowers‚Äîone that recalls Vincent van Gogh's treatment of the subject from nearly forty years before, but in which MacDonald would have relied on sketches of sunflowers he made in his own garden at Thornhill, Ontario. Accustomed to the smooth blending and muted tones of Canadian academic art in the style of the Canadian Art Club, the critics were taken aback by the brightness and intensity of the colours. The art critic for the Toronto Daily Star called it \\"an incoherent mass of color\\". Hostile art critics thereafter singled out MacDonald for attacks in the press. The Tangled Garden, 1916, National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario In the autumn of 1918, MacDonald, Harris, and other artists interested in their new Canadian approach to painting travelled to the Algoma district north of Lake Superior in a specially outfitted Algoma Central Railway car that functioned as a mobile artist studio. The group would hitch their car to trains travelling through the area, and when they found a scenic location, they would unhitch and spend time exploring and painting the wilderness. MacDonald would return to Algoma with his colleagues for the next several autumns. These trips would produce some of his most acclaimed paintings, including Mist Fantasy, Sand River, Algoma (1920) and The Solemn Land (1921). File:J.E.H.

The other founding members were Frederick Varley, A. Y. Jackson, Lawren Harris, Frank Johnston, Arthur Lismer, and Franklin Carmichael. MacDonald had worked with Lismer, Varley, Johnston, and Carmichael at the design firm Grip Ltd. in Toronto. Together they initiated the first major Canadian national art movement, producing paintings directly inspired by the Canadian landscape. Every summer beginning in 1924, MacDonald travelled to the Canadian Rockies to paint the mountainous landscapes that dominated his later work. By this time he had become somewhat alienated from the rest of the Group of Seven, as many of the younger members were beginning to paint in a more abstract manner. File:J.E.H.

Today, MacDonald is viewed with general admiration for his art, with one writer commenting, \\"no Canadian landscape painter possessed a richer command of colour and pigment than J. E. H. MacDonald ... His brushwork is at once disciplined and vigorous. His best on-the-spot sketches possess an intensity and freshness of execution not dissimilar from Van Gogh.\\"Paul Duval, J.E.H.

Dick. It examines the concept of totally unempathic and 'logical' humans (\\"Null-O\\"'s) in a parody of the plot and concepts of The Pawns of Null-A by A. E. van Vogt. These beings view individual collections of matter, i.e. any object, as subjective structures and see the true state of reality as an 'undifferentiated world of pure energy'. They can also move their ears independently, giving them excellent hearing. After attaining positions of power they proceed with a plan to ultimately return everything in the universe to this state. This is to be done by the construction of successively more powerful bombs, ultimately resulting in the rather improbable 'U-bomb' that will homogenise the whole universe. The Null-O plan is halted, however, when the 'ordinary' people of the world, who have survived the nuclear destruction of Earth's surface in the shelters built by their employers, rise up in drilling machines to stop the construction of an 'E-Bomb' designed to destroy Earth, and succeed in destroying both the E-Bomb prototype and the Null-O's themselves.

He was principally known for his work as a DJ on BBC Radio 1 (particularly the Saturday morning Junior Choice) and Radio 2 and as a presenter for Top of the Pops and Crackerjack on BBC Television. Biography =Early life and career= Stewart was born Edward Stewart Mainwaring, the son of a Treasury solicitor, in Exmouth, Devon, on . He attended Eagle House School, Sandhurst, Berkshire and St Edward's School, Oxford, and his broadcasting career began in Hong Kong.Who's Who on Radio compiled by Sheila Tracy, World's Work Ltd, (1983). While touring there as bass player with a jazz group, he gained a job on a local radio station as a sports commentator, then as an announcer and, finally, as a disc jockey. He remained at this station for four years. In July 1965 Stewart became a DJ on the offshore radio station Radio London (Big L) where he became a household name before the marine offences bill was passed, and was its chief DJ by the time it closed on 14 August 1967. =Career with BBC Radio and Television= Stewart began his broadcasting career on pirate station Radio London (Big L) in May, 1967. After Radio London shut down, Stewart became one of the first DJs to join Radio 1, presenting Happening Sunday and What's New. In 1968, Stewart took over the weekend morning Junior Choice show, where he remained for a dozen years. The show was peppered with catch-phrase jingles such as \\"'Ello Darlin'\\", recorded by an unknown patient at a hospital in Billericay, and \\"Happy Birthday to You\\" sung by an eight- year-old boy, from a football club in Crosskeys, on the team coach after the match. In 1968 he recorded the charity single \\"I Like My Toys\\", a cover of The Idle Race song, as \\"Stewpot And Save The Children Fund Choir\\". In 1972 he also presented Radio 1's Sunday Sport show. One week in early 1972, he stood in for Alan Freeman on Pick of the Pops, as well as sitting in for the likes of David Hamilton and Terry Wogan through the 1970s. On 10 September 1973 Stewart became the first presenter of Radio 1's Newsbeat programme. Stewart became a regular presenter of the BBC television programme Top of the Pops in 1971. He also presented the children's programme Crackerjack from 1973 to 1979,\\"DJ Ed 'Stewpot' Stewart dies after stroke\\", Oxford Mail, 9 January 2016. and had a short-lived programme Ed and Zed in 1970. In 1980 Stewart moved to Radio 2, presenting Family Favourites and the weekday afternoon programme from 2pm to 4pm. He was dropped from the line-up in October 1983. Stewart said he was \\"shocked and disappointed\\" by the decision of Radio 2 controller Bryant Marriott not to renew his contract. =Commercial radio= Stewart moved to the commercial radio station Radio Mercury (now Heart FM), for six years, presenting their mid-morning show. =Back to the BBC= Stewart rejoined Radio 2 in 1991, first presenting a series of shows and then a regular Saturday afternoon show throughout the summer. In 1992, he once again presented weekday afternoons. This time, the show was broadcast from 3:30pm to 5pm, before moving to 3pm to 5pm in the spring of 1996 and 2pm to 5pm in the spring of 1998. In 1995, Stewart made radio history when he broadcast his Radio 2 show live from the summits of Ben Nevis and Snowdon, in aid of the Cystic Fibrosis Trust. The senior guide on the ascent, Wayne Naylor, said at the time that Ed Stewart had carried his own equipment and was accompanied by his wife. In early July 1999, Stewart was taken off the weekday afternoon slot, and moved to his Sunday evening show from 5pm to 7pm. At the time the official word was that Stewart had decided to go into semi-retirement, however he later revealed in his autobiography that he was taken off from the programme by then controller Jim Moir. He was replaced in the afternoons by Steve Wright, who continues to host the show to this day. During this time, Stewart also became a stand in for Terry Wogan on the Breakfast show until around 2002. His Sunday show was a blend of music and chat, plus listeners' letters and Where Are They Now?, a feature that attempts to re-unite old friends who have lost touch with each other. The show ran until Stewart left Radio 2 in April 2006, not long after his autobiography was published in which he questioned the position of his colleagues Sarah Kennedy and Johnnie Walker on the network. Walker replaced him on Sunday afternoons. Stewart was back for Radio 2's 40th birthday on Sunday 30 September 2007, hosting Junior Choice. The revival was so successful, that Stewart returned to present Junior Choice on Christmas Eve that year, which led to him hosting further editions of Junior Choice on Christmas Day from 2008 to 2015. Stewart also hosted the afternoon show on Radio Bristol for two days in the run up to Christmas 2001, and also appeared on the Ken Bruce show's Pop Master quiz on Radio 2 on 2 October 2007. Anneka Rice replaced Stewart on the Christmas edition of Junior Choice, from 2017 onwards, after a hiatus in 2016 following his death. =Other radio work= In February 2005, Stewart took over the weekday afternoon show on Spectrum FM, an English-speaking radio station that broadcasts to Spain. Stewart was heard on Big L 1395 covering for David Hamilton on 18 December 2006, and also in January 2007. He also covered for Mike Read there in March 2007. He presented special shows on Classic Gold on Christmas Day 2006, New Year's Day 2007 and also May Day Bank Holiday Monday 2007. He did a one-off Sunday morning show (10am2pm) on KCFM in September 2008. He also stood in for Shaun Tilley on his programme \\"I Haven't Heard It For Ages\\" (2pm4pm) on Sundays on KCFM 2008/9. From February 2009 to September 2009 Stewart presented on Saturday and Sunday mornings between 9am and noon on Internet radio station Wight FM (this was voicetracked). Stewart also stood in for Shaun Tilley on the networked show The Retro Chart Years for a week in August 2009 and again in 2010. He also appeared on another of Shaun Tilley's shows The Vintage Top 40 Show, which goes out on various BBC local stations on Sundays at 5pm. In July 2014, he took part in a Radio Legends week, presenting a one-off 4 hour show on BBC Sussex and BBC Surrey. Look-in Magazine For many years Stewart was the figurehead for children's magazine Look-in, the \\"Junior TV Times\\". Starting in 1971 with a feature on a day in his life, he was brought in as a regular with a feature called \\"'Stewpot's Look-out\\", which later became \\"'Stewpot's Newsdesk\\". They also used his name in other features such as \\"Stewpot's Starchart\\". Newsdesk ended in 1980, as did Stewart's association with the magazine. Cameo The voice saying \\"Excuse me, may I have the pleasure of this dance?\\" on the original 1973 single \\"Won't Somebody Dance with Me\\" by Lynsey de Paul was Stewart's. Personal life Stewart's two main interests were playing golf (he often met listeners of his programme who volunteered to caddy for him) and football; he was a supporter of Everton F.C. In 1975 Stewart was inducted into the entertainment fraternity, the Grand Order of Water Rats. While working for Jimmy Henney, Stewart met his future wife, the then 13-year-old daughter of Henney. The couple married four years later in London on 2 July 1974,Stewart 2005, p. 153. but split up in November 2003 and divorced in 2005. The couple had a daughter and a son. From 2004 until his death, Stewart's partner was Elly. She accompanied him on many of his appearances and was with him in the studio for his last edition of his children's show Junior Choice on BBC Radio 2 on Christmas Day 2015. He was a close friend of Max Bygraves. On Bygraves's death in 2012 he recalled him as a \\"unique talent\\" whose skills as a comedian, actor and singer \\"brought a lot of pleasure to a lot of people\\". Stewart was also an advocate and supporter of Phab Ltd, a charity operating in England and Wales which promotes inclusion for children and adults with disabilities. Stewart attended annual events held to raise awareness of Phab's work.\\"Louis Goldberg Award Winner 2015, House of Lords on Thursday 8th October. Awards presented by Phab‚Äôs President Ed Stewart and Baroness Campbell of Surbiton DBE\\", Phab. From September 2008 Stewart was the presenter of Mantovani concerts, featuring the Magic of Mantovani Orchestra, which took place at the Lighthouse in Poole, and at the Pavilion Theatre in Bournemouth. On the first two of these, he was joined by co- presenter, Alexandra Bastedo. Also connected with those concerts are his contributions to the filmed documentary Mantovani, King of Strings (Odeon Entertainment) IMDb and on the Radio 2 programme Mantovani by Michael Freedland, broadcast 3 days before his death on 6 January 2016. At the time of his death, Stewart was planning to do a Stewpot Music Quiz tour of the UK with UK quiz promoters Quiz Britain, with his last charity quiz appearance at Walhampton Arms on 6 November 2015 for a local Hampshire hospice. Death Just 2 weeks after hosting the 2015 Christmas Day edition of Junior Choice on BBC Radio 2, Stewart died suddenly, aged 74, on 9 January 2016 in hospital in Bournemouth after suffering a major stroke a few days earlier. On 10 February 2016 BBC Radio 2 broadcast an hour-long tribute to Stewart introduced by Anneka Rice, who went on to take over the Christmas Day edition of Junior Choice, starting the following year.

The album peaked at number 28 on the UK Albums Chart. Album On Orbital the duo aimed to make more atmospheric music than the dance raves of their first album. They used more complex rhythms and denser arrangements on the appropriately named pieces entitled \\"Lush\\" but still proving themselves capable of making quality pop music on \\"Halcyon + On + On\\", with vocals from Kirsty Hawkshaw of Opus III. The album begins with \\"Time Becomes\\", which uses the same speech sample by the actor Michael Dorn in Star Trek: The Next Generation (Time squared - season 2 episode 13, Worf - 20'30 : \\"There is the theory of the M√∂bius. A twist in the fabric of space where time becomes a loop\\") which opened their first album. The piece uses phasing, a technique popularized by Steve Reich, in which two identical samples are repeated at slightly different speeds. The brothers enjoy aural puns, and the use of the sample from Star Trek: The Next Generation (which appeared on the opening of their first album) was meant to play with listeners by making them believe for a few seconds that they had bought a mispressing. The muffled intro on \\"Planet of the Shapes\\" has the intentional addition of record static and crackles, followed by the sound of a needle skipping grooves then scratching across the record, also meant to trick fans who bought the vinyl edition, by making them think their copy was less than perfect. The second song on the album, \\"Planet of the Shapes\\", contains a sample from the movie Withnail & I (\\"even a stopped clock gives the right time twice a day\\"). \\"Impact\\" also samples a line from \\"a French film dubbed into English\\" with a \\"conspiracy, alien plot\\" that the band no longer remembers the name of. Meat Beat Manifesto were an influence on the album, after Orbital toured with the group in the United States ahead of recording it. The breakbeat on \\"Impact\\" was provided by Jack Dangers and \\"Remind\\" is an instrumental re-recording of Orbital's \\"Mind the Bend the Mind\\" remix of \\"Mindstream\\" by Meat Beat Manifesto, which removed all elements of \\"Mindstream\\" from the piece. The remix and final work was inspired by the Fabio Paras remix of React 2 Rhythm's I Know You Like It. \\"Walk Now...\\" samples the sound of a Sydney zebra crossing alert and a didgeridoo, which were both recorded after a trip to Australia to perform at an illegal rave named Welcome 92. Critical reception The album received widespread acclaim. In the UK, NME praised the record, saying, \\"The techno album is a doughty brute to master. Only a few have managed it successfully [...] but Phil and Paul Hartnoll have done it twice... The expression 'intelligent ambience' is bandied around to describe spacey dance music with undue regularity, but Untitled actually satisfies the description. Scientific and terrific.\\" Q also recognised that the duo had made a second successful album, saying, \\"Like their first album, Orbital's current effort is a finely balanced combination of muso trickery and astute dance tracks... Again, like the latter, it benefits from repeated listening.\\" Melody Maker claimed that \\"This new album (untitled, like the first) puts them firmly back in the firmament\\". In a reference to the most talked about band at the time of the album's release, Suede and their sexually ambiguous frontman Brett Anderson, and including a pun on \\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\", the debut single by the Sex Pistols, the review concluded, \\"As warm as plasma and as eerie as ectoplasm, Orbital's (out-of-)body-music is the true sound of Androgyny-in- the-UK.\\" Vox observed that \\"this collection sees Paul and Phil Hartnoll drifting still further into the heart of the machine, touching upon the sometimes fragile soul of Techno\\", before declaring that \\"Orbital are still leading the field\\". =Accolades= This album is included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die alongside their 1994 LP 'Snivilisation'. It (along with the In Sides album) was also included in Q magazine's \\"90 Best albums of the 1990s\\". In 1996, Mixmag ranked the album at number 9 in its list of the \\"50 Best Dance Albums of All Time\\".http://www.muzieklijstjes.nl/MixmagBestdance.htm In 1999, Ned Raggett ranked the album at number 21 on his list of \\"The Top 136 or So Albums of the Nineties\\".

Fenrir has an apparent magnitude of 25, making it one of the faintest known moons in the Solar System, and was discovered using some of the largest telescopes in the world. It is even too dark to be observed by the Cassini spacecraft in orbit around Saturn, for which it never gets brighter than approximately 17th apparent magnitude. Fenrir was named after Fenrisulfr, a giant wolf from Norse mythology, father of Hati and Skoll, son of Loki, destined to break its bonds for Ragnar√∂k. Fenrir is about 4 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 22,454 Mm in 1260 days, at an inclination of 163¬∞ to the ecliptic (143¬∞ to Saturn's equator) with an eccentricity of 0.136. The Fenrian orbit is retrograde: it orbits Saturn in a direction opposite to the planet's spin, suggesting that this irregular moon was captured by Saturn.

The island contains about of land, a mile-long beach and features a high-end beach resort with 61 rooms. Parrot Cay became a private island resort in 1998. It is located about south east of Miami, and can be reached by a 35-minute boat ride from Providenciales, the main island in Turks and Caicos. History Parrot Cay was originally created by a Kuwaiti family in 1988, who built the large structure that now functions as the resort's main building. The Gulf War affected the finances of this family, and it remained empty until it was bought over and remade into a resort in 1998 by Singaporean hotelier Christina Ong for her COMO Hotels and Resorts group. It is said that her daughter Melissa Ong discovered the island during a diving trip. The island was originally named Pirate Cay because of a local legend that famous female pirate Anne Bonny camped here in the 1720s. It was renamed Parrot Cay as to not frighten visitors. Resort Parrot Cay's main resort contains 61 rooms, including beach houses and villas. Two restaurants are located on the island: the south-east Asian inspired Lotus and the Italian-Mediterranean Terrace. Activities include diving, snorkeling, and wellness programs like yoga and Pilates at the COMO Shambhala retreat. Private homes In addition to the resort's rooms, there is a collection of private villas and beach houses located a short distance from the resort in a location called Rocky Point. The villas can be purchased from a starting price of US$10 million, while the beach houses start from US$5 million. Owners of private homes in Parrot Cay include Keith Richards, Donna Karan, and Bruce Willis. Keith Richards has been quoted as saying he'd relocate his family to his Parrot Cay retreat if he knew his death was coming, and just \\"hang out\\". Popularity Because of its secluded location and the privacy it provides, Parrot Cay has become very popular with many celebrities. Guests have included Paul McCartney, Justin Timberlake, Barbra Streisand, Pen√©lope Cruz, Julia Roberts and Phil Collins, and it has also hosted the weddings of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner in 2005. =Celebrity death hoaxes= Parrot Cay is frequently featured as the location of an ongoing celebrity death hoax on fake news site Global Associated News. The fake news report would claim that a celebrity had died after sustaining injuries in a jet-ski accident in Parrot Cay, even though there are no jet-skis in Parrot Cay. Celebrities that have supposedly died in Parrot Cay according to this hoax include Ted Nugent, Ja Rule, Chad Kroeger and Vince Vaughn.

Dick story collections, beginning with The Golden Man in 1980. \\"The Last of the Masters\\" depicts a society 200 years after a global anarchist revolution has toppled the national governments of the world (the exact year is unstated). Civilization has stagnated due to the loss of scientific knowledge and industry during the legendary revolt. Elsewhere, the last state, governing a highly centralized and efficient society, conceals itself from the Anarchist League, a global militia preventing the recreation of any government. When three agents of the League are sent to investigate rumors of the microstate's existence, the government arranges for them to be killed, leading to the death of one and the capture of another. Tensions rapidly escalate after the agents of the state realize that the third has escaped. Assuming he will report the state's existence, the government mobilizes for total war. In actuality, the surviving anarchist elects to attempt his comrades' rescue and assassinate the head of state: the last surviving \\"government robot\\". The primary theme of the story is the conflict between anarchism and statism, the political and ethical dimensions of which are explored through the characters' dialogue. Though the attention the story received was limited prior to the author's death in 1982, it has since seen greater circulation in Philip K. Dick story collections, and has been reviewed and analyzed for its postmodern critique of technology and its political implications.  Plot summary = The last government = The title character, Bors, a 200-year-old \\"government integration robot\\"‚Äîand the last in existence‚Äîawakens after a routine maintenance check to learn that his motor system is in a state of decline. An artificially intelligent machine who displays a degree of emotion and even psychological complexity, he is informed by Fowler, a personal mechanic, that his body has begun to break down due to age. His legs no longer work, his motor system will be irreparable in a matter of months, and full paralysis will take place in under a year. Of his entire body, only five \\"synapse coils\\" have not yet begun to degrade. These memory units are irreplaceable due to the lack of skilled technicians and rare components needed to recreate them. Within them, he stores the last records of advanced science and technology, which he uses to guide his society at high efficiency as a benevolent dictator, operating according to utilitarian principles. Though he wields hegemonic control over his society, he views his dictatorship as the last bastion of humanity's scientific progress, and views himself as a guardian who oversees and protects that progress. This causes him to privately despair that he‚Äîand the knowledge only he possesses‚Äîwill soon die. He also becomes increasingly paranoid, fearing to trust a loyal assistant, Peter Green, and confiding only in Fowler, his personal mechanic. Hidden in a remote mountain valley, Bors commands the world's last government. The microstate is tightly centralized around him, and he manages it bureaucratically for optimum efficiency in all sectors of the economy and military. The effect is \\"an accurate and detailed reproduction of a society two centuries gone.\\" Bors is immediately established as an utterly necessary figure in his society and is quickly escorted back into service as the leader of the government by Fowler. A personal assistant as well as mechanic to Bors, Fowler maintains a pretension of loyalty to the robot, but privately recognizes that his society is stagnant and that its leader is becoming mentally unbalanced. Pessimistic, he expresses cynicism regarding the subservient role humans in his society play to Bors. He is contrasted with Peter Green, a genuinely loyal assistant to the robot, who is among the few humans trusted to oversee his body while it is unconscious for repair. Though loyal to his leader, Green nonetheless draws Bors' distrust as the robot's paranoia steadily grows. = The Anarchist League = Elsewhere, three members of the \\"Anarchist League\\" are on a mission to investigate rumors of a government in existence near a remote mountain valley. The League is a global organization dedicated to seeking out and eradicating governments. Established at some unknown point during or after the global revolt, the League is organized around \\"League camps\\" which dot the landscape. Members of the League are easily recognized by their \\"ironite staffs\\": metallic walking sticks which they are trained in using as weapons. These tools are a symbol of the League‚Äî\\"the walking Anarchists who patrolled the world on foot, the world's protection agency.\\" The three member team is composed of Edward Tolby, his daughter, Silvia Tolby (of unspecified age, but vaguely described as an adolescent or young adult), and their mutual friend, Robert Penn. While en route to the valley, the team arrives in a small rural town by the name of Fairfax. Fairfax is littered with ancient, decaying gadgets; the last remnants of the era of governments and high tech society, which none of the locals know how to fix or reproduce. Excited by the strangers, the locals ask about the League. Tolby answers their questions in turn, ending with an explanation of the timeline of events which led up to the great revolt. The event is summarized as having begun with revolts in Europe which overthrow the national governments. After France exists for a month free of government, millions join the by then explicitly anarchist movement to disarm the nuclear powers. At each toppled government center, millions of records are burned and government integration robots are destroyed. These events result in the setting of the story; a world full of anachronistic high-technology, interspersed in a pre- industrialized, agrarian culture. = Conflict and resolution = While retelling the story of the anarchist revolution, Tolby attracts the attention of a local who invites the trio of anarchists to her home, but who is in secret a government spy ordered to kill them. The ensuing assassination plot is bungled, as the spy dies in the process, but succeeds in killing Penn. Silvia is also badly injured and left unconscious. Her father survives the tragedy largely unscathed, however, and awakens as a patrol of military scouts arrives. The scouts panic after a brief counterattack by Tolby and retreat with Silvia captive. After re-arming himself, Tolby sets out to mount her rescue. Bors is alerted to the situation and overreacts upon learning that one of the three anarchists has escaped. Fearing that the agent will alert the world to their existence, he initiates plans for a war economy and decides to question Silvia in her hospital room. Their dialogue reveals the story of his escape during the collapse of governments and the establishment of the microstate. He was damaged and in transport for repairs when the anarchist revolution began 200 years prior, allowing him to survive in hiding. Enraged by his calm indifference to the prospect of war, Silvia attacks him and attempts her escape, but is restrained by guards. Tolby infiltrates the mountain valley, sneaking past the rapidly mobilizing army of the state. After killing and outmaneuvering inexperienced soldiers, he arrives at the government center and encounters Fowler. Fowler alludes to his desire to end the government and spurs Tolby onward. Ultimately, Tolby confronts and kills Bors, sending the building into confusion as the citizens react with hysteria and grief. The condition is implied to spread outward from the city to troops in the hills, resulting in mass desertion. No longer resisted by guards, Tolby reunites with Silvia. The story concludes as Fowler secretly salvages three remaining synapse coils from Bors' remains, \\"just in case the times change\\".  Publication history  Written early in Philip K. Dick's career, \\"The Last of the Masters\\" was advertised on the front cover for the final issue of Orbit Science Fiction in 1954. The exact date Philip K. Dick wrote \\"The Last of the Masters\\" is unknown, but the original manuscript of the novelette was received by the Scott Meredith Literary Agency on July 15, 1953. 25 years old at the time, Dick was in the habit of submitting a new story to the agency weekly. Just prior to receiving \\"Last of the Masters\\", the agency received \\"The Turning Wheel\\" on July 8, and following the former, the agency received \\"The Father-thing\\" on July 21. \\"The Last of the Masters\\" was published over a year later, in the 1954 November/December issue of Orbit Science Fiction no.5. The issue was the last in a science fiction anthology series edited by Donald A. Wollheim. Orbit Science Fiction advertised \\"The Last of the Masters\\" on its cover and included Dick among an advertised list of prominent contributing authors, among them August Derleth, Gordon R. Dickson, and Chad Oliver. The novelette was republished in 1958 for the Australian market by Jubilee Publications Pty., in Space Station 42 and Other Stories, a part of the Satellite Series. The novelette was not published again until the 1980 release of The Golden Man, the sixth collection of classic stories by Dick. This collection also included the only commentary Dick ever wrote regarding the story. Thereafter, \\"The Last of the Masters\\" was included in six more print collections‚Äîmost of which have seen multiple print runs‚Äîand two audiobooks.  Reception  Fellow speculative fiction author Thomas M. Disch praised the works of Philip K. Dick, but criticized \\"The Last of the Masters\\" as an example of Dick's poorly written, early pulp stories. While \\"The Last of the Masters\\" was little noticed in the years immediately following its publication, it was reviewed after its 1980 publication in The Golden Man collection. Fellow science fiction writer Thomas M. Disch reviewed Dick's The Golden Man collection among other works in \\"Fluff and Fizzles\\", an essay dated to 1979, but published in a 1980 edition of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. While celebrating several stories in the collection, and proclaiming to readers the \\"categorical imperative\\" of buying a copy, he nonetheless derided most of its contents as \\"turkeys\\", citing specifically \\"The Last of the Masters\\" as an example. Referring to the story as \\"a hyperkinetic foray into hairy-chested-style hugger-mugger\\", Disch also mocked its \\"action-packed denouement\\" involving Edward Tolby as an example of \\"bogus machismo\\". In her 1982 review of the Golden Man collection, Hazel Pierce lauded the sophistication of the story, summarizing the theme of \\"The Last of the Masters\\" as an examination of \\"the paradoxical cast of human existence.\\"  Thematic analysis  = Technological critique = In his 1980 commentary on the story, Dick also suggested that his reasoning for making Bors sympathetic was a result of a form of trust he advanced towards robots, as opposed to androids. \\"Perhaps\\", he suggested, \\"it's because a robot does not try to deceive you as to what it is\\". One of the themes that runs throughout all of Dick's fiction is the \\"power of empathy\\" and he uses it as the \\"key element defining the authentic human being\\". For example, when Silvia meets the robot that runs the government, she exclaims \\"My God, you have no understanding of us. You run all this, and you're incapable of empathy. You're nothing but a mechanical computer.\\" Christopher Palmer, of La Trobe University, has written on the postmodern literary themes of Dick's early short stories, analyzing stories in which \\"breakdown and ignorance\\" are the result of social upheaval. Palmer proposed that Dick often created post- apocalyptic scenarios of ruined worlds which held high tech gadgets in an attempt to present a view of postmodern materialism. Common to many of Dick's short stories were settings in which the outgrowth of modernity is a world where that which is natural is in ruin, and what is artificial is reshaped through science into a fantastically high tech form. Palmer presented \\"The Last of the Masters\\" as an example of this, as well as \\"The Variable Man\\" and The Penultimate Truth, two other post-apocalyptic works by Dick. Palmer contended that these shared themes were \\"...not simply the expression of dystopian malaise, or of Luddism treacherously taking up residence in popular SF... It points to a coherent interpretation of industrialism and post- industrialism.\\" Suggesting that many of the philosophical and political underpinnings of the author's short stories stemmed from his views on domestic life, Palmer's focus turned to Dick's common use of sterility as a metaphor. In \\"The Gun\\", \\"Second Variety\\", The Penultimate Truth, and \\"The Last of the Masters\\", people and sometimes the earth itself have been driven to sterility. As Palmer noted of \\"The Last of the Masters\\", Bors can be interpreted as a symbol of infertility: \\"It is not clear why he does not replicate himself, or educate his human servants: it is simply a given that he is sterile. The old, technologically advanced, highly organized civilization is a civilization of production, but now under Bors it can do no more than maintain itself.\\" Following an inspection of other short stories with similar references to sterility, Palmer asserts that Dick's work presented a social and existential protest. Palmer interpreted Dick's social critique to be that if the act of creation validates existence, and genuinely expresses a form of individuality, then the process of reproduction is alienating, oppressive, and retards an individual's liberty. As Palmer explains, \\"...this process disempowers consumers, and even technocrats, by making them dependent on a process of which they have become entirely ignorant.\\" Existentially, Palmer interpreted Dick to further mean that reproduction violated the author's concept of what made an object unique and valuable: \\"A thing can't be a real thing unless it is in some sense an individual thing.\\" In writing a biography on the author, Brian Stableford placed several of Dick's short stories in a context that established their relationship to the author's personal hardships. \\"...it always seemed to him [Philip K. Dick] that his career was a catalogue of undeserved disappointments and the record of his published work a travesty of his true ambitions.\\" The personal problems which Dick struggled throughout his life provided fuel for several of the anxiety driven themes for his short stories. In Dick's early work, Stableford highlighted recurring themes in those most popular. These included paranoid suspicions; the dangerous hostility of \\"seemingly innocent entities\\"; and \\"the mechanization of the environment and the computerization of political decision-making\\". Stories in which androids and robots are a danger to the protagonist include \\"Autofac\\", \\"Colony\\", and Vulcan's Hammer. However, \\"The Last of the Masters\\", Stableford contends, was an exception to Dick's common dystopic portrayals of technology, given Stableford's interpretation of Bors as an altruist, who was \\"benign\\" in its role. = Political interpretations = In his 1980 commentary, Philip K. Dick pointed out the moral ambiguity of the story, laying out its political implications: \\"Should we have a leader or should we think for ourselves? Obviously the latter, in principle. But ‚Äì sometimes there lies a gulf between what is theoretically right and that which is practical.\\" This quote became part of a larger political analysis of Dick's work in How Much Does Chaos Scare You? by Aaron Barlow, Associate Professor of English at New York City College of Technology. In analyzing Dick's short fiction, Barlow presented their themes against the backdrop of post-September 11, 2001 America. In particular, Barlow compared many of the philosophical underpinnings of Neoconservatism, and its rise to prominence during the George W. Bush administration, to the philosophy of Philip K. Dick. \\"To [Dick],\\" writes Barlow, \\"the elites were both alien and dangerous. To him, the focus of vision and of political debate should never be on the rulers, but on the little person, the shopkeeper, the mechanic.\\" In his dissection of Dick's work, Barlow compared several stories in which normal humans lose some form of liberty in their society to an elite group. Examples presented include \\"Autofac\\", \\"Null-O\\", and \\"Some Kinds of Life\\". From these stories, Barlow drew three themes important to Dick's anti-government writings: first, that humanity is often doomed by institutions of power created by the humans themselves; second, that paranoia is a natural aspect of governance, as \\"[n]o elite can ever completely trust the people it governs,\\" and this distrust leaves a governed people in perpetual danger; and third, that the belief that individuality must be sacrificed‚Äîeither for the sake of social stability or survival‚Äîis a constant threat. \\"To Dick,\\" Barlow adds, \\"there are few attitudes more dangerous than this.\\" Each of these themes would be revisited in \\"The Last of the Masters\\". Continuing his analysis, Barlow addressed \\"The Last of the Masters\\", contrasting it with an earlier work by Dick, \\"The Defenders\\". In \\"The Defenders\\", humanity has been duped by a noble lie‚Äîprovided by their robot soldiers‚Äîinto believing in a war which is not actually taking place. In the latter story, Barlow asserts that Dick surprisingly agreed with such neoconservative theorists as Leo Strauss in the efficacy of the deception. \\"Here, the [robots] have saved mankind... The 'noble lie' has served its purpose.\\" However, Barlow concedes, \\"[b]ut this is an extremely early story and Dick had not yet clarified his own world view...\\" Comparing this story to \\"The Last of the Masters\\", Barlow took note of Dick's commentary from The Golden Man collection (\\"...sometimes there lies a gulf between what is theoretically right and that which is practical.\\") and concluded that the story represented Dick's understanding of \\"the problems at the other extreme...\\" in politics. Where most of Dick's stories presented government in skeptical terms to warn the reader of potential abuse, \\"The Last of the Master\\" presented an argument for the utility of government. Barlow dissected the Anarchist League and \\"the contradictory nature of their organization\\" which patrolled a \\"poor and dirty\\" world, and juxtaposed this with the \\"opulent organization of the (state)\\". In particular, he highlighted dialogue by the robot master, Bors, as illustrating the importance of his leadership to the success of the micro-state. In the story, a conversation with a mechanic leads the robot to state, \\"You know I'm the only one who can keep all this together. I'm the only one who knows how to maintain a planned society, not a disorderly chaos! If it weren't for me, all this would collapse, and you'd have dust and ruins and weeds. The whole outside would come rushing in to take over!\\" Barlow concluded that while the story ended in triumph for the anarchists, the story did not go so far as to validate their society. \\"Dick does not vindicate them,\\" writes Barlow, \\"keeping it clear that the robot had certainly accomplished something in that valley, though it had eventually gone too far.\\" = Spiritual allegory = In a commentary made for the 1980 anthology, The Golden Man, Philip K. Dick briefly touched on several themes of the story, including the Christian allegory of the \\"suffering servant\\", manifested in the character of Bors. This was touched upon in the Dick biography Divine Invasions, by memoirist and biographer Lawrence Sutin. Drawing on Dick's commentary, Sutin sees Bors as part of a religious pattern in Dick's stories as a \\"Christ-like robot\\", and likens the robot to characters in other stories by Dick who suffer from illness.

Biography =Early life= =Life in Japan= In 1878, Roesler was invited by the government of Japan to serve as an advisor on international law to the Foreign Ministry. One compelling reason for his choice to move to Japan was due to his conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1878, Roesler faced dismissal from service in Mecklenburg due to his religion. A timely meeting with Japanese ambassador to Germany, Aoki Sh≈´z≈ç introduced Roesler to a new opportunity, and Roesler became one of several legal experts from Germany and France working on development of the Japanese legal system. In 1884, Roesler became an adviser to the Japanese Cabinet. As the request of It≈ç Hirobumi Roesler assisted Inoue Kowashi and took an influential role in the preparation of the draft of the Japanese Commercial Code and the Constitution of the Empire of Japan. From the time of the Iwakura mission, the Japanese ruling oligarchy had evaluated the various forms of government extant in Europe and America and were most impressed by the Austro-Germano-Prussian model, based on theories by Lorenz von Stein and Rudolf von Gneist and the organization of Prussian government designed by Albert Mosse. Roesler expanded on these theories, by recommending a constitutional monarchy in which the monarch was head of state, but not constrained by the legislature, whose primary responsibility was to provide advice and consent to the Emperor's rule, and not to govern the country or to promulgate laws. Moreover, sovereignty was with the Emperor and not with the people. Roesler remained in Japan until 1893. While in Japan, relationship with the German legation in Japan and his socialization with the German expatriate community was almost non-existent. After leaving Japan, Roesler and his family moved to Bolzano, then part of Austria-Hungary where he died shortly after.

History Portable power plant built by Canadian Car and Foundry\\"Welcome to Saskrailmuseum.org.\\" Sask Power Car, September 11, 2008. Retrieved: 3 October 2008. Canadian Car & Foundry (CC&F;) was established in 1909 in Montreal as the result of an amalgamation of three companies: * Rhodes Curry Company of Amherst, NS - founded 1891 * Canada Car Company of Turcot, QC - founded 1905 * Dominion Car and Foundry of Montreal, QC In 1911 the CC&F; Board of Directors recognized that the company could improve its efficiency if they were able to produce their own steel castings, a component that was becoming common to all their products. They purchased Montreal Steel Works Limited at Longue-Pointe, the largest producer of steel castings in Canada, and the Ontario Iron & Steel Company, Ltd. at Welland, ON, which included both a steel foundry and a rolling mill. Buses were produced at Fort William, Ontario and railcars in Montreal and Amherst. Streetcars were manufactured between 1897 and 1913, however the company focused exclusively on rebuilding existing streetcars after 1913. A few years later, CC&F; acquired the assets of Pratt & Letchworth, a Brantford, ON, rail car manufacturer. In the latter part of World War I, the expanding company opened a new plant in Fort William (now Thunder Bay) to manufacture rail cars and ships which included the French minesweepers Inkerman and Cerisoles which were both lost in Lake Superior; the Amherst plant started by Rhodes & Curry in Amherst was closed in 1931. In an attempt to enter the aviation market, CC&F; produced a small series of Grumman fighter aircraft under licence and developed an unsuccessful, indigenous- designed fighter aircraft, the Gregor FDB-1. =Canada Car Company= Canada Car Company was a railcar manufacturer based in Turcot, Quebec (a suburb of Montreal), and later merged with several other companies to form Canadian Car and Foundry in 1909.Canada Car Company Canada Car Company was incorporated January 1905 with W.P. Coleman as president and Sir Hugh Allan as vice- president. The company's plant began operations in 1905 and manufactured freight and passenger cars. Clients included: * Grand Trunk Railway and Grand Trunk Pacific Railway - 12,000 freight cars and 250 passenger cars (wood) * Quebec, Montreal & Southern - 1,500 steel underframe box cars with Dominion Car and Foundry * Montreal Street Railway - 10 streetcars * Hart-Otis Car Company - Hart convertible ballast cars * Grand Trunk Railway - 30 steel underframe flat cars * Temiskaming & Northern Ontario Railway - three parlour- cafe cars * Canadian Northern Railway - four wooden dining cars Their products were: * wood freight and passenger cars * box cars * streetcars * flat cars * parlor cafe cars * dining cars =First World War= Minesweepers for France During World War I, CC&F; had signed large contracts with Russia and Britain for delivery of ammunition. An enormous factory was constructed in the Kingsland to assemble, package, and prepare artillery shells for shipment to foreign ports. No shells were manufactured there. On January 11, 1917, a fire started in one of the buildings. In four hours, the fire spread to the approximately 500,000 pieces of 76.2 mm (3 inch) -high explosive shells stored there, causing several explosions, destroying the entire plant. The explosion launched artillery shells and building debris across the area, destroying several homes and businesses in the nearby towns of Haskell, Pompton Lakes, and Midvale. The total loss, including the ordnance, was estimated at $16,750,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). Canadian Car and Foundry had a contract to build twelve minesweepers for the French Navy. The vessels were completed in October and November 1918‚Äîbefore the war ended, but too late to see operational service. Two of the vessels, the Cerisoles and the Inkerman, were lost in a November gale, on Lake Superior, on their maiden voyage. Other vessels were sold into civilian service. =Second World War= CC&F; Hawker Hurricane X on a test flight over Fort William, Ontario CC&F-built; Harvard Mk.4 By 1939, with war on the horizon, Canadian Car & Foundry and its Chief Engineer, Elsie MacGill, were contracted by the Royal Air Force to produce the Hawker Hurricane (Marks X, XI and XII). Refinements introduced by MacGill on the Hurricane included skis and de-icing gear. When the production of the Hurricane was complete in 1943, CC&F;'s workforce of 4,500 (half of them women) had built over 1,400 aircraft, about 10% of all Hurricanes built.Saxberg, Kelly (director). Rosies of the North (Documentary film on the wartime role of women workers at Fort William) National Film Board of Canada, 1999. Retrieved: 23 July 2012. Following the success of the Hurricane contract, CC&F; sought out and received a production order for the troublesome Curtiss SB2C Helldiver. Eventually, 834 Helldivers were produced by CC&F; in various versions from SBW-1, SBW-1B, SBW-3,SBW-4E and SBW-5. Some of the Curtiss divebombers were sent directly to the Royal Navy under Lend-Lease arrangements. CC&F; also built the North American AT-6 Texan/Harvard under licence, many of the aircraft being supplied to European air forces to train post war military pilots. In 1944, the Canadian Car & Foundry built a revolutionary new aircraft in its Montreal shops - the Burnelli CBY-3, also called the Loadmaster. There were two examples built of an aerofoil-fuselage design originally developed by Vincent J. Burnelli. The CBY-3 was never to enter full-scale production and was cancelled less than one year later. The work of Canadian women building fighter and bomber aircraft at the plant during the Second World War is documented in the 1999 National Film Board of Canada documentary film Rosies of the North. =Postwar developments= After the Second World War, the CC&F; returned to its roots as a rail car manufacturer. They also made a successful leap into the streetcar business, supplying Montreal, Toronto, Regina, Calgary, Vancouver, Edmonton, and the Brazilian cities of Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo with various types of streetcars. The company concluded a licensing agreement with ACF-Brill (the successor to J. G. Brill) in 1944 to manufacture and sell throughout Canada buses and trolley coaches of ACF-Brill design as Canadian Car-Brill, in later years often written \\"CCF-Brill\\", for short.

Trolleybus production ended in 1954; Edmonton Transit System's No. 202, a 1954 CCF-Brill T48A, was the very last Brill trolleybus built for any city.Trolleybus Magazine No. 283, January‚ÄìFebruary 2009, p. 11. National Trolleybus Association (UK). ISSN 0266-7452. Production of the Brill diesel bus continued through the 1950s. In 1960, CC&F; launched an entirely new TD bus design under the Canadian Car name to compete with the General Motors New Look model, but it was not successful and production was discontinued in 1962. In 1957, wishing to diversify, the British Hawker Siddeley Group acquired CC&F; through its Canadian subsidiary, A.V. Roe Canada Ltd.. In 1962, A.V. Roe Canada was dissolved when the Avro Arrow program was suddenly terminated, and its assets became part of Hawker Siddeley Canada. During the 1970s they introduced the BiLevel Coach heavy railway passenger car, which would go on to great success. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the plant built 190 Canadian Light Rail Vehicles, for the Toronto Transit Commission, to replace its aging PCC streetcars. CCF re-emerged as Can-Car Rail in 1983 as a joint division between Hawker Siddeley Canada and UTDC. The Can-Car Rail operations were based in Thunder Bay. Sold to SNC-Lavalin in 1986, a financial shakeup led to the firm being returned to the Government of Ontario, and then quickly re-sold to Bombardier Transportation. Through a series of further acquisitions, mergers and rationalisations, CC&F; faded from the annals of significant Canadian manufacturers, although the company still exists today as the Bombardier Transportation Canada Inc. railcar facility in Thunder Bay, Ontario.

Its discovery was announced by Scott S. Sheppard, David C. Jewitt, Jan Kleyna, and Brian G. Marsden on 4 May 2005, from observations taken between 12 December 2004 and 11 March 2005. Hati is about 6 kilometers in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 20,303 Mm in 1080 days, at an inclination of 163¬∞ to the ecliptic (165¬∞ to Saturn's equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.291. In March 2013, the synodic rotational period was measured by Cassini to about hours. This is the fastest known rotation of all of Saturn's moons. It was named in April 2007 after Hati, a giant wolf from Norse mythology, son of Fenris√∫lfr and twin brother of Sk√∂ll.

The organization is based on a combination of automated scanning of metadata similar to data mining and manual tagging of content. The metadata stored in applications is correlated based on a structure for the data type handled by the organizer tool. For example, the email address of a sender of an email allows the email to be filed in a virtual folder for the author and company the author works for or a music file is filed by the musician and album label. The resulting visualization simplifies use of desktop content to navigate, search, and use related information stored on the desktop computer. The data in desktop organizer tools is normally stored in a database rather than the computer's file system in order to produce virtual folders where the same item can appear in multiple folders to the user based on its relationship to the folder. Desktop organizers are related to desktop search because both sets of tools allow users to locate desktop resources. The primary differences between the two are that desktop organizers perform post-search functionality related to the primary purpose of the organizer, offer manual taxonomy creation and tagging by the desktop user, and help gather additional related resources for taxonomy or related content from Internet resources. Communications organizers Organization tools of contacts and correspondences involve the tracking and management of information stored in multiple communications tools. Due to the rise of computers for use in communications including email, VoIP applications like Skype, chat, web browsers, blogs, RSS and CRM content relating to companies and contacts is often spread across multiple applications. Desktop communications organizers collect and correlate information stored in these applications. Common features of communications organizers include: * Connectivity through scanners and listeners to communications tools including email, chat, bookmarks, and VoIP * RSS newsfeed subscriptions * Filing of desktop files and documents * Connectivity to desktop search or desktop search capabilities * Virtual folders to locate the same item in multiple locations * Workflow utilities to mark items for follow- up and annotate items Picture organizers Also referred to as image viewers, picture organizers provide utilities to file and view pictures in folders and to tag pictures with metadata for future use. Picture organizers may also integrate with photo sharing sites that also organize pictures but through a social network. There are two classes of picture organizers: * Automatic picture organizers. These are software packages that read data present in digital pictures and use this data to automatically create an organization structure. Each digital picture contains information about the date when the picture was taken. It is this piece of information that serves as the basis for automatic picture organization. The user usually has little or no control over the automatically created organization structure. Some tools create this structure on the hard drive (physical structure), while other tools create a virtual structure (it exists only within the tool). * Manual picture organizers. This kind of software provides a direct view of the folders present on a user's hard disk. Sometimes referred to as image viewers, they only allow the user to see the pictures but do not provide any automatic organization features. They give maximum flexibility to a user and show exactly what the user has created on his hard drive. While they provide maximum flexibility, manual organizers rely on the user to have his/her own method to organize their pictures. Currently there are two main methods for organizing pictures manually: tag and folder based methods. While not mutually exclusive, these methods are different in their methodology, outcome and purpose. Presently, many commercial image organization software offer both automatic and manual picture organization features. A comparison of image viewers reveals that many freely available software packages are available that offer most of the organization features available in commercial software. However, not all image viewers offer organizational tools. Popular picture organizers include Google's Picasa, DigiKam, Adobe Systems's Elements, Apple's iPhoto, Phase One's Media Pro 1 and Novell's F-spot. Common key organizational tools provided by picture organizers are: * Organization by date or date range * Tagging of pictures with attributes including location, people, and * Storing the same picture in multiple virtual folders * Rating of pictures Music organizers Music contains unique attributes such as artist, album, genre, era, and song title used to organize the songs. The desktop organization of music is primarily embedded into audio players and media players like Amarok, Rhythmbox, Banshee, MediaMonkey, Songbird, Apple's iTunes and Microsoft's Windows Media Player or Zune. Organization is used to create playlists, or to organize the media collection into a folder hierarchy, by specific artists, albums, or genres. Another type of the music organizers allows user to organize his media collection directly without listening of music. By connecting the audio players to databases of tagged music to compare a collection with a professionally organized and tagged collection of music, MP3 collections can be enhanced with metadata corrections to support the organization process when metadata is not complete in the original items.

Special to Finnish is a narrow phoneme inventory and vowel harmony. As Finnish is a mora-divided language, it is morae that are exchanged, not syllables (often a mora is also a syllable in a Finnish word, but not always). Also, Finnish inflectional and derivational morphology is extensive, thus applying a suffix from another word often produces a valid word. This leads to large number of possible spoonerisms. Much of practical sananmuunnos wordplay revolves around obscene double entendre expressed by spoonerism. Several books have been written. Some have whole stories with multiple puns in one sentence, for example. Most have a \\"vocabulary\\" in the back, usually a hundred or more word pairs long.  Processes  Initial morae of two adjacent words are exchanged, which is spoonerism by definition. :Mikkelin kittaajat ('chuggers of Mikkeli', a town in Finland) ‚Üí kikkelin mittaajat ('measurers of weenie') The \\"extra length\\" of a long vowel is a full mora, and thus stays in its original position, making the new vowel long. :sanan m _uu_ nnos [sa-nan mu- Àênnos] ‚Üí [mu-nan sa-Àênnos] ‚Üí munan s _aa_ nnos If necessary, stilted diphthongs are converted into allowed diphthongs as per phonotactics. The first vowel is the determinant for choosing the diphthong. The process preserves opening and closing diphthongs, e.g. the opening 'ie' is reflected as an opening 'uo'. :vieno huntti [vi-eno hu-ntti] ‚Üí [h _u-e_ no vi-ntti] ‚Üí h _uo_ no vintti If necessary, vowel harmony is applied. As per vowel harmony, the initial syllable controls the kind of vowel selected. :h√§ipyv√§t tavut [h√§- ipyv√§t ta-vut] ‚Üí [ta-ipyv√§t h√§-vut] ‚Üí taipuvat h√§vyt That is, transformation is A, U, O into √Ñ, Y, √ñ, if the former do not begin the word. Notice that information may be lost in this step, making it irreversible.  Exceptions  It is possible (although not accepted by some \\"orthodox\\") to exchange only the initial consonants, if that is the only way to get a sensible result. E.g. palasokeri [p-ala/s-okeri] 'sugar lump' ‚Üí salapokeri [s-ala/p-okeri] 'playing poker in secret' (*solapakeri would not mean anything). Typically presented, spoonerisms are a kind of double entendre. Appropriately, the very term sananmuunnos is one; it becomes munansaannos, which can be understood as \\"small yield of penis\\".

One of the largest hospitals in the United States by number of beds, it is located at 462 First Avenue in the Kips Bay neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. Bellevue is also home to FDNY EMS Station 08, formerly NYC EMS Station 13. The facility offers comprehensive healthcare services, including outpatient, specialty, and skilled nursing care, as well as emergency and inpatient services. The hospital contains a 25-story patient care facility and has an attending physician staff of 1,200 and an in-house staff of about 5,500. Bellevue is a safety net hospital, providing healthcare for individuals regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay. It handles over half a million patient visits each year. In 2014 Bellevue was ranked 40th overall best hospital in the New York metro area and 29th in New York City by U.S. News and World Report. Though Bellevue is a full-service hospital, it was once popularly associated with its treatment of mentally ill patients who required psychiatric commitment. The name \\"Bellevue\\" became a pejorative slang term for a psychiatric hospital. History An engraving from 1866 showing the city's first morgue, located in Bellevue The administration building in 1950 The original psychiatric hospital building =Founding= Bellevue traces its origins to the city's first permanent almshouse, a two-story brick building completed in 1736 on the city common, now City Hall Park. In 1798, the city purchased Belle Vue farm, a property near the East River several miles north of the settled city, which had been used to quarantine the sick during a series of yellow fever outbreaks. When the grid system of streets was established in 1811, the survey had to take the hospital into account, and the placement of First Avenue on the grid is mainly because of the location of Bellevue. The hospital was formally named Bellevue Hospital in 1824. By 1787 Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons had assigned faculty and medical students to Bellevue. Columbia faculty and students would remain at Bellevue for the next 181 years, until the restructuring of the academic affiliations of Bellevue Hospital in 1968. New York University faculty began to conduct clinical instruction at the hospital in 1819. In 1849, an amphitheater for clinical teaching and surgery opened. In 1861, the Bellevue Hospital Medical College, the first medical college in New York with connections to a hospital, was founded. By 1873, the nation's first nursing school based on Florence Nightingale's principles opened at Bellevue, followed by the nation's first children's clinic in 1874 and the nation's first emergency pavilion in 1876; a pavilion for the insane, an approach considered revolutionary at the time, was erected within hospital grounds in 1879. For that reason, the name Bellevue is sometimes used as a metonym for psychiatric hospitals. Bellevue initiated a residency training program in 1883 that is still the model for surgical training worldwide. The Carnegie Laboratory, the nation's first pathology and bacteriology laboratory, was founded there a year later, followed by the nation's first men's nursing school in 1888. By 1892, Bellevue established a dedicated unit for alcoholics. =City reorganization= In 1902, the administrative Bellevue and Allied Hospitals organization were formed by the city, under president John W. Brannan. B&AH; also included Gouverneur Hospital, Harlem Hospital, and Fordham Hospital.Annual Report, Volume 1, by New York (State). Dept. of Social Welfare, 1908, page 268 B&AH; opened doors to female and black physicians.No One Was Turned Away : The Role of Public Hospitals in New York City since ... by Department of Urban Studies at Vassar College, 1999, page 67 In the midst of a tuberculosis epidemic a year later, the Bellevue Chest Service was founded. Bellevue opened the nation's first ambulatory cardiac clinic in 1911, followed by the Western Hemisphere's first ward for metabolic disorders in 1917. New York City's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner began on the second floor in 1918. German spy and saboteur Fritz Joubert Duquesne escaped the hospital prison ward in 1919 after having feigned paralysis for nearly two years. PS 106, the first public school for the emotionally disturbed children located in a public hospital, opened at Bellevue in 1935. In 1939, David Margolis began work on nine Work Projects Administration murals in entrance rotunda titled Materials of Relaxation, which were completed in 1941. Bellevue became the site of the world's first hospital catastrophe unit the same year; the world's first cardiopulmonary laboratory was established at Bellevue by Andre Cournand and Dickinson Richards a year later, and the nation's first heart failure clinic opened, staffed by Eugene Braunwald, in 1952. In 1960. New York City's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner moved out of the second floor and into its new building at 520 First Avenue, but still maintained close relations with Bellevue. In 1962, Bellevue established the first intensive care unit in a municipal hospital, and in 1964, Bellevue was designated as the stand-by hospital for treatment of visiting presidents, foreign dignitaries, injured members of the city's uniformed services, and United Nations diplomats. Bellevue joined the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation as one of 11 acute care hospitals in 1970. In 1981, Bellevue was certified as an official heart station for cardiac emergencies; a year later it was designated as a micro-surgical reimplantation center for the City of New York, by 1983 as a level one trauma center, and by 1988 as a head and spinal cord injury center. In 1990, it established an accredited residency training program in Emergency Medicine. The building that formerly served as the hospital's psychiatric facility started to be used as a homeless intake center and a men's homeless shelter in 1998. The publication of the Bellevue Literary Review, the first literary magazine to arise from a medical center, commenced in 2001; Bellevue Literary Press was founded six years later as a sister organization of the Bellevue Literary Review. In April 2010, plans to redevelop the former psychiatric hospital building as a hotel and conference center connected to NYU Langone Medical Center fell through. The aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in October 2012 required evacuation of all patients due to power failure and flooding in the basement generators. Bellevue was renamed NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue in November 2015 as a reflection of its parent organization's rebranding. Medical firsts Multiple firsts were performed at Bellevue in its early years. In 1799, it opened the first maternity ward in the United States. By 1808, the world's first ligation of the femoral artery for an aneurysm was performed there, followed by the first ligation of the innominate artery ten years later. Bellevue physicians promoted the \\"Bone Bill\\" in 1854, which legalized dissection of cadavers for anatomical studies; two years later they started to also popularize the use of the hypodermic syringe. In 1862, the Austin Flint murmur was named for Austin Flint, prominent Bellevue Hospital cardiologist. By 1867, Bellevue physicians were instrumental in developing New York City's sanitary code, the first in the world. One of the nation's first outpatient departments connected to a hospital (the \\"Bureau of Medical and Surgical Relief for the Out of Door Poor\\") was established at Bellevue that year. In 1868, Bellevue physician Stephen Smith became first commissioner of public health in New York City; he initiated a national campaign for health vaccinations. A year later, Bellevue established the second hospital-based, emergency ambulance service in the United States. In 1889, Bellevue physicians were the first to report that tuberculosis is a preventable disease; five years later was the successful operation of the abdomen for a pistol shot wound. William Tillett discovered streptokinase, later used for the acute treatment of myocardial infarction, at Bellevue in 1933. Nina Starr Braunwald performed the first mitral valve replacement in 1960 at the hospital. In 1967, Bellevue physicians perform the first cadaver kidney transplant. In 1971, the first active immunization for hepatitis B was developed by Bellevue physicians. Bellevue played a key role in the development of the \\"Triple Drug Cocktail\\" or HAART, a breakthrough in the treatment of AIDS, in 1996. In October 2014, Bellevue took in an Ebola patient, Craig Spencer, an individual who worked with M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (Doctors Without Borders) in Guinea a month prior during the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa.  Facilities  One of the largest hospitals in the United States by number of beds, it handles nearly 460,000 non-ER outpatient clinic visits, nearly 106,000 emergency visits and some 30,000 inpatients each year. More than 80 percent of Bellevue's patients come from the city's medically underserved populations. Bellevue is a safety net hospital, in that it will provide healthcare for individuals regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay. The hospital occupies a 25-story patient care facility with an ICU, digital radiology communication and an outpatient facility. The hospital has an attending physician staff of 1,200 and an in- house staff of about 5,500. Bellevue features separate pediatric (0-25) and adult (25+) emergency departments.  In popular culture  Bellevue has entered popular consciousness through its status as a major hospital in the largest city in the United States. The hospital notably treated the author Norman Mailer, who was taken to Bellevue after he stabbed his wife; and Mark David Chapman, who shuttled between Bellevue and the jail complex on Rikers Island after he shot and killed musician John Lennon. The poet Allen Ginsberg, also a former patient, mentioned the hospital by name in his famous poem \\"Howl\\" (1955). Bellevue has been the subject of books including Bellevue: Three Centuries of Medicine and Mayhem at America‚Äôs Most Storied Hospital, by historian David Oshinsky, Twelve Patients: Life and Death at Bellevue Hospital, by Dr. Eric Manheimer, a former Bellevue medical director, Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue, by Dr. Danielle Ofri, a long-time physician at Bellevue. The NBC television series New Amsterdam (2018-) takes place at a fictionalized version of Bellevue, renamed \\"New Amsterdam\\" in the show. Based on Manheimer's book, the series has filmed scenes at Bellevue and other New York City public hospitals. American rock band The Sloppy Boys use the hospital's history as a psychiatric care facility as a point of reference in their song \\"Breakfast at Bellevue,\\" featured on their 2020 album, Paradiso.

Biography He was born in the Stratfield section of Stratford, now Bridgeport, Connecticut, in New England on November 5, 1727. The son of Gideon Hawley and Hannah Bennett who was the daughter of Lieutenant James Bennett. Hawley's mother died at his birth and his father died three years later. He was the grandson of Ephraim and Sarah (Welles) Hawley from Trumbull. He was the great grandson of Joseph Hawley (Captain), first of the Hawley name to come to America in 1629, and was twice great grandson of Thomas Welles Governor of the Colony of Connecticut. He married Lucy Fessenden, second daughter of Reverend Benjamin Fessenden (Harvard 1718) and Rebecca (Smith) Fessenden, of Sandwich. They had three sons and two daughters. Lucy died December 25, 1777 at 50. Gideon married again to Mrs. Elizabeth Burchard, widow of Captain David Burchard of Nantucket, on October 7, 1778. Religious Education Hawley graduated from Yale in 1749. He was licensed to preach in May 1750. In 1752, in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, he accepted a position with the Society for Propagating the Gospel among the Indians, under the supervision of Jonathan Edwards who was a preacher to the whites and the Housatonic Indians in Stockbridge. Hawley taught Mohawk, Oneida, and Tuscarora Indians there, with Edwards occasionally visiting to give advice. Missionary to the Indians In 1753, Hawley accepted a position from the commissioners of Indian affairs to establish a mission among the Six Nations at the town of Oquaga on the Susquehanna, near what is now Windsor, New York, in the area where another Yale graduate, Rev. Elihu Spencer, had made an unsuccessful attempt at ministry in the late 1740s. Hawley left for the site in 1754. Besides acting as a missionary, Hawley also acted as an interpreter at this post. French and Indian War The French and Indian War did not affect his mission until 1756, when he was forced to leave. He then went to Boston and joined the army as chaplain of Colonel Richard Gridley's regiment, and attempted after this campaign to return to the Iroquois mission, but the enterprise proved too hazardous. He spent the winter in West Springfield, Massachusetts and tried to rejoin his mission in the spring of 1757, but an outbreak of small pox there prevented him from returning. The commissioners of the Society for propagating the gospel appointed him pastor of the Indian tribes at Mashpee, Massachusetts, where he was installed in April 1758 and remained as a missionary until his death in 1807. Reverend Timothy Dwight IV Timothy Dwight IV in his Travels in New England and New York, writes about his visit with Hawley on October 2, 1800 and his correspondence with him afterward. Dwight wrote that after dinner he went to Hawley's house to visit and had an interview, \\"more interesting than words can describe\\" with Hawley. Dwight had not seen Hawley since he was a young man of eighteen. Dwight writes; \\"this gentleman was a most intimate friend of my parents. From his youth he had sustained as amiable and unexceptionable a character as can perhaps be found among uninspired men\\". During this visit in 1800, Gideon's son James was on his death bed. Hawley wrote to Dwight on April 29, 1801 to tell him of the death of his son James, eight days after his visit.

It was one of a breed of social bookmarking tools, similar to CiteULike and del.icio.us, where users can save links to their favourite websites. ReadCube is a similar free service that offers storage, annotation and sharing tools specifically for scientific documents. Connotea was aimed primarily at scientists (though the user community included other academic disciplines), and while users could bookmark any webpage they chose, it incorporated special functionality for certain academic resources. Connotea recognised a number of scientific websites and automatically collected metadata for the article or page being bookmarked, including author and publication names. It was also possible to add non- recognised webpages by manually entering information. An alternative method of adding an article was to retrieve the Connotea form and add the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for the article. Information about the material was retrieved automatically using CrossRef, the official DOI registration point. This function meant that it was possible to quickly retrieve the reference for a print article that had an electronic counterpart with a DOI. When saving an article to Connotea, users \\"tagged\\" the article with keywords of their choice which they could later use to find it again. By categorising articles with relevant keywords e.g. \\"C. elegans\\", the social aspect of Connotea was developed. The system recognised users who were bookmarking the same papers or using the same keywords, and alerted them to potentially-related material. Allowing completely free tagging means a folksonomy can gradually develop. By default, links posted to Connotea were publicly viewable, allowing network effects to build up rapidly, but it was also possible for users to keep selected links private, either indefinitely or until a specified date and time. Connotea also provided RSS feeds, allowing users to keep track of articles posted under interesting tags or by users with similar interests. Connotea had the capacity to export the references in RIS format to a citation manager program. This meant that it was possible to save references when working on a computer without such bibliographic software installed and import them into this software for citing at a later stage. In September 2005, Connotea won the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers Award for Publishing Innovation, and in November 2005 was shortlisted for the International Information Industry awards in the Best Scientific, Technical and Medical (STM) Product category.International Information Industry awards Connotea discontinued service on March 12, 2013.Nature.com blog:\\"Connotea to discontinue service\\" An export tool remained live until April 16, 2013 so that registered users could export their bookmarks.

In many nations, women's suffrage was granted before universal suffrage, so women and men from certain classes or races were still unable to vote. Some countries granted suffrage to both sexes at the same time. This timeline lists years when women's suffrage was enacted. Some countries are listed more than once, as the right was extended to more women according to age, land ownership, etc. In many cases, the first voting took place in a subsequent year. Some women in the Isle of Man (geographically part of the British Isles but not part of the United Kingdom) gained the right to vote in 1881. New Zealand was the first self- governing country in the world in which all women had the right to vote in, but not to stand for, parliamentary elections in 1893. The colony of South Australia allowed women to vote and stand for election in 1894.1894: Women‚Äôs suffrage, South Australia, National Museum of Australia In Sweden, conditional women's suffrage was granted during the age of liberty between 1718 and 1772.Karlsson Sj√∂gren, √Ösa, M√§nnen, kvinnorna och r√∂str√§tten: medborgarskap och representation 1723‚Äì1866 [Men, women and suffrage: citizenship and representation 1723‚Äì1866], Carlsson, Stockholm, 2006 (in Swedish) But it wasn't until the year 1919 that equality was achieved, where women's votes were valued the same as a man's. The Australian Commonwealth Franchise Act of 1902 enabled women to vote at federal elections and also permitted women to stand for election to the Australian Parliament, making the newly-federated country of Australia the first in the modern world to do so, although some states excluded indigenous Australians. In 1906, the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland, which became the republic of Finland, was the second country in the world to implement both the right to vote and the right to run for office. Finland was also the first country in Europe to give women the right to vote.Brief history of the Finnish ParliamentCentenary of women's full political rights in Finland The world's first female members of parliament were elected in Finland the following year. In Europe, the last jurisdiction to grant women the right to vote was the Swiss canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden (AI), in 1991; AI is the smallest Swiss canton with 14,100 inhabitants in 1990. Women in Switzerland obtained the right to vote at federal level in 1971, and at local cantonal level between 1959 and 1972, except for Appenzell in 1989/1990, see Women's suffrage in Switzerland. In Saudi Arabia women were first allowed to vote in December 2015 in the municipal elections.

Complete Boolean algebras are used to construct Boolean-valued models of set theory in the theory of forcing. Every Boolean algebra A has an essentially unique completion, which is a complete Boolean algebra containing A such that every element is the supremum of some subset of A. As a partially ordered set, this completion of A is the Dedekind‚ÄìMacNeille completion. More generally, if Œ∫ is a cardinal then a Boolean algebra is called Œ∫-complete if every subset of cardinality less than Œ∫ has a supremum. ExamplesEvery finite Boolean algebra is complete. *The algebra of subsets of a given set is a complete Boolean algebra. *The regular open sets of any topological space form a complete Boolean algebra. This example is of particular importance because every forcing poset can be considered as a topological space (a base for the topology consisting of sets that are the set of all elements less than or equal to a given element). The corresponding regular open algebra can be used to form Boolean-valued models which are then equivalent to generic extensions by the given forcing poset. *The algebra of all measurable subsets of a œÉ-finite measure space, modulo null sets, is a complete Boolean algebra. When the measure space is the unit interval with the œÉ-algebra of Lebesgue measurable sets, the Boolean algebra is called the random algebra. *The algebra of all measurable subsets of a measure space is a ‚Ñµ1-complete Boolean algebra, but is not usually complete. *The algebra of all subsets of an infinite set that are finite or have finite complement is a Boolean algebra but is not complete. *The Boolean algebra of all Baire sets modulo meager sets in a topological space with a countable base is complete; when the topological space is the real numbers the algebra is sometimes called the Cantor algebra. *Another example of a Boolean algebra that is not complete is the Boolean algebra P(œâ) of all sets of natural numbers, quotiented out by the ideal Fin of finite subsets. The resulting object, denoted P(œâ)/Fin, consists of all equivalence classes of sets of naturals, where the relevant equivalence relation is that two sets of naturals are equivalent if their symmetric difference is finite. The Boolean operations are defined analogously, for example, if A and B are two equivalence classes in P(œâ)/Fin, we define A\\\\land B to be the equivalence class of a\\\\cap b, where a and b are some (any) elements of A and B respectively. :Now let a0, a1,... be pairwise disjoint infinite sets of naturals, and let A0, A1,... be their corresponding equivalence classes in P(œâ)/Fin . Then given any upper bound X of A0, A1,... in P(œâ)/Fin, we can find a lesser upper bound, by removing from a representative for X one element of each an. Therefore the An have no supremum. *A Boolean algebra is complete if and only if its Stone space of prime ideals is extremally disconnected. Properties of complete Boolean algebrasSikorski's extension theorem states that if A is a subalgebra of a Boolean algebra B, then any homomorphism from A to a complete Boolean algebra C can be extended to a morphism from B to C. *Every subset of a complete Boolean algebra has a supremum, by definition; it follows that every subset also has an infimum (greatest lower bound). * For a complete boolean algebra both infinite distributive laws hold. * For a complete boolean algebra infinite de-Morgan's laws hold. The completion of a Boolean algebra The completion of a Boolean algebra can be defined in several equivalent ways: *The completion of A is (up to isomorphism) the unique complete Boolean algebra B containing A such that A is dense in B; this means that for every nonzero element of B there is a smaller non-zero element of A. *The completion of A is (up to isomorphism) the unique complete Boolean algebra B containing A such that every element of B is the supremum of some subset of A. The completion of a Boolean algebra A can be constructed in several ways: *The completion is the Boolean algebra of regular open sets in the Stone space of prime ideals of A. Each element x of A corresponds to the open set of prime ideals not containing x (which is open and closed, and therefore regular). *The completion is the Boolean algebra of regular cuts of A. Here a cut is a subset U of A+ (the non-zero elements of A) such that if q is in U and p‚â§q then p is in U, and is called regular if whenever p is not in U there is some r ‚â§ p such that U has no elements ‚â§r. Each element p of A corresponds to the cut of elements ‚â§p. If A is a metric space and B its completion then any isometry from A to a complete metric space C can be extended to a unique isometry from B to C. The analogous statement for complete Boolean algebras is not true: a homomorphism from a Boolean algebra A to a complete Boolean algebra C cannot necessarily be extended to a (supremum preserving) homomorphism of complete Boolean algebras from the completion B of A to C. (By Sikorski's extension theorem it can be extended to a homomorphism of Boolean algebras from B to C, but this will not in general be a homomorphism of complete Boolean algebras; in other words, it need not preserve suprema.) Free Œ∫-complete Boolean algebras Unless the Axiom of Choice is relaxed, free complete boolean algebras generated by a set do not exist (unless the set is finite). More precisely, for any cardinal Œ∫, there is a complete Boolean algebra of cardinality 2Œ∫ greater than Œ∫ that is generated as a complete Boolean algebra by a countable subset; for example the Boolean algebra of regular open sets in the product space Œ∫œâ, where Œ∫ has the discrete topology. A countable generating set consists of all sets am,n for m, n integers, consisting of the elements x‚ààŒ∫œâ such that x(m)   * Boolean algebra Forcing (mathematics) Order theory ","title":"Complete Boolean algebra"},{"id":"1839945","text":"Woburn Sands railway station serves the town of Woburn Sands and village of Wavendon in the borough of Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, England.

The portal and the section of tunnel connecting it to Boylston served streetcars from 1897 to 1901, Main Line Elevated trains from 1901 to 1908, and streetcars again from 1908 to 1962. The Pleasant Street incline is now abandoned, but plans have been floated at various times to reuse it. History Map of the portal area, showing the former street configuration Pleasant Street portal in 1901 when the Main Line operated through the Tremont Street subway. An inbound Main Line (now Orange Line) test train is at the high platform at left, while an inbound trolley is on the right. This view faces south, away from the portal. Looking south at the flying junction approaching the portal. The left branch goes to the inbound tracks from Shawmut Avenue/City Point and Tremont Street, the right branch to the outbound tracks to Shawmut Avenue/City Point (mid right) and Tremont Street (far right). =Early use= The incline opened on 1 October 1897, one month after the first section of the Tremont Street subway, allowing streetcar lines from Roxbury, Dorchester, and points south to operate via the subway. The new tunnel stretched from the outer tracks at Boylston south under Tremont Street, with a four-track portal in the triangle bounded by Tremont Street, Pleasant Street (later part of Broadway), and Shawmut Avenue. The tunnel carried two tracks, splitting into four tracks at a flying junction near the portal, with the northbound (western) track going over the southbound (eastern) track. The two western tracks continued down Tremont Street, while the eastern tracks turned east on Pleasant Street via Broadway to City Point in South Boston. On 10 June 1901, streetcar service through the portal stopped, as the Washington Street Elevated (later part of the Orange Line) was connected to the two outermost tracks. El trains came out of the portal, stopped at a new Pleasant Street station with a center island platform in an open cut, passed under Pleasant Street, and then rose onto an elevated structure. Many surface streetcar lines were truncated to , the south end of the new El, until late November 1909. After the Washington Street Tunnel opened on 30 November 1908, the elevated trains were rerouted through it, and the streetcars returned to the incline by their old routes, while the Pleasant Street station closed. =Decline= On March 2, 1953, the City Point line was replaced by the 9 bus route. The tracks to Tremont Street, formerly connected to the west tracks of the portal, were realigned to the east tracks, allowing a bus transfer station to be built where the west tracks had been. The Tremont Street line was bustituted as the 43 route on November 20, 1961, and a streetcar shuttle started between the portal and Boylston, with transfers to the subway. This shuttle was short-lived, ending with closure of the portal on April 6, 1962. The Pleasant Street portal is now covered by Elliot Norton Park at the intersection of Tremont Street, Shawmut Avenue, and Oak Street West. Proposed reuse Silver Line Phase III alternatives. The Tremont Street alignment (yellow) would have reused the former streetcar tunnel for buses. Reuse of part of the tunnel for the Silver Line Phase III was briefly considered, but the narrow bore was found too small for the Silver Line buses which (unlike trolleys) are not fixed to their guideway. Plans for the Phase III tunnel were shifted further west to new alignments, then canceled due to questions over the project's cost-effectiveness. The 2003 Program for Mass Transportation included the possibility of converting the Washington Street section of the Silver Line to to light rail (as had originally been promised) using the abandoned southern section of the subway to connect to the central subway at Boylston. However, the Phase III tunnel and continued bus service was recommended instead. In 2012, the Roxbury-Dorchester-Mattapan Transit Needs Study recommended the conversion to light rail and reuse of the tunnel as a long-term project, with the additional possibility of extending the line down Blue Hill Avenue to Mattapan along the # route.

The serial is set in an English estate in 1925. In the serial, the alien time traveller the Fifth Doctor (Peter Davison) investigates the murder of two servants during a fancy dress party. This story was the first purely historical adventure for the Doctor‚Äîfeaturing no science fiction elements save for the TARDIS and the regular cast‚Äîsince The Highlanders (1966). Sarah Sutton plays two characters in this story. Plot In an English country house, two figures struggle before one of them falls dead. A young woman sleeps as a figure enters her room. The figure is then seen tied to the bed guarded by a South American Indian. It is 11 June 1925, and as a train departs Cranleigh Halt railway station the TARDIS materialises. The crew encounters Lord Cranleigh's chauffeur, who has been expecting \\"the Doctor\\". Lord Cranleigh asks them to stay until the annual ball and offers them costumes. They are introduced to Ann Talbot, Lord Cranleigh's fianc√©e, who looks identical to Nyssa. When Tegan admires a black flower, Lady Cranleigh explains it is a Black Orchid and was found on the Orinoco by her son George. Tegan recognises the name as George Cranleigh, a famous botanist and explorer. Lady Cranleigh says that George never returned from his expedition into the Brazilian forests. Ann was engaged to George. The bound figure struggles against his bonds. When the Indian inspects the figure, he is knocked unconscious. The Fifth Doctor picks a Harlequin outfit to wear to the ball. Ann comes to their room, presenting Nyssa with a dress identical to her own; the ball attendees will be unable to tell them apart. As the Doctor prepares for the ball, a figure enters his room from a secret passage. Hearing a noise, the Doctor returns to the room, but only sees the opening. He enters the secret passage, but the panel closes behind him. The figure takes the Harlequin costume. The ball has started. Lady Cranleigh talks with the Indian. He tells her his \\"friend\\" has escaped. The figure wearing the Harlequin costume dances with Ann. The Doctor enters a room full of botany textbooks, finding the secret room where the figure was bound, a book written in Portuguese, and a corpse. The Harlequin enters the building with Ann. Ann tells it they should return to the party, but it grabs her by the wrist. Ann screams for help and a butler rushes to her assistance. The Harlequin strangles him, causing Ann to faint. The Doctor returns to the secret room, finding Lady Cranleigh and the Indian, whom she introduces as Latoni ‚Äì a Brazilian friend. The Doctor shows them the corpse, which she identifies as one of the servants. She requests he not inform the guests. The figure returns the Harlequin costume to the Doctor's room then goes to a room where Ann is lying, and a hideously deformed face is revealed. Ann awakes and seeing the figure flees into the room where Lady Cranleigh and Latoni are. Latoni gathers rope, advancing on the deformed figure. The servants inform Lord Cranleigh of events inside the house. He finds the dead butler and Ann's mask. The Doctor arrives wearing the Harlequin costume and Ann identifies him as her attacker. Ann implores Sir Robert to arrest the Doctor. The Doctor proclaims his innocence, suggesting that someone else has an identical costume. Ann states there was only one Harlequin. He looks to Lady Cranleigh to provide an alibi but she stays silent. Sir Robert questions the Doctor regarding his identity, and he says he is a Time Lord and that he travels in time and space. Looking to Lady Cranleigh he mentions the other body, but she denies seeing it. Showing Sir Robert the cupboard, the body has been replaced with a doll. Lord Cranleigh receives a telephone call from his friend \\"Smutty\\" Thomas who he thinks sent the Doctor to meet him, and he realises it is the wrong man. Lord Cranleigh informs Sir Robert that the Doctor is an impostor; the real doctor missed his train. The Doctor is arrested for murder, his companions accused of being accessories. They are driven to the police station. The Doctor asks the sergeant to divert to the railway station to show Sir Robert the TARDIS, but it is not on the platform. They find the TARDIS at the police station. Lady Cranleigh tells Lord Cranleigh about the other body, that of Digby the servant, establishing his innocence. In the secret room, the bound figure slips his ropes and kills Latoni, after Latoni has hidden the room key. Unable to find the key, the figure starts stuffing newspapers under the door then sets them on fire. The Doctor invites Sir Robert and the police sergeant into the TARDIS. Astounded by what he sees, Sir Robert offers the Doctor an apology, but is still concerned about the murder. Lord Cranleigh telephones the police station, informing them of the second body. The Doctor uses the TARDIS to return to Cranleigh Hall. The secret room is ablaze with the fire started by the deformed figure, who breaks out and goes to the main hall where Lord and Lady Cranleigh are talking. The figure grabs hold of Nyssa and drags her upstairs. The Doctor cannot follow because the fire has spread. Sir Robert demands to know what the deformed figure is, and Lady Cranleigh reveals it is George. She insists George would not harm Ann, but the Doctor points out he has the wrong girl. George carries Nyssa onto the roof. The Doctor asks Lord Cranleigh to distract George while he finds a way to their position. Lady Cranleigh confesses to Sir Robert: George's injuries were caused by Indians, who removed his tongue because they held the Black Orchid sacred. Losing his mind, he was rescued by another tribe of Indians, of which Latoni was a member. She admits that George killed Digby. Lord Cranleigh climbs onto the roof to confront George, and the Doctor also reaches the roof. The Doctor implores him to release Nyssa, telling him to look down and see Ann. George releases Nyssa. Charles approaches his brother to thank him, but George recoils and falls off the roof to his death. Before the Doctor departs Ann gives Tegan and Nyssa their costumes as presents and Lady Cranleigh presents the Doctor with a copy of George's book. Production This serial was commissioned by producer John Nathan-Turner during a period when the series did not have a Script Editor. Nathan-Turner had originally considered directing this story himself, which would have made him the first producer to do so since Barry Letts during the early 1970s. However, due to time constraints, Nathan-Turner abandoned the idea and hired Ron Jones to direct. =Cast notes= To avoid giving away the plot surprise, Gareth Milne's character was listed as \\"The Unknown\\" for Part One and in Radio Times, and as \\"George Cranleigh\\" for Part Two. Michael Cochrane, who plays Lord Cranleigh, also appears in the 1989 Seventh Doctor serial Ghost Light. He also appeared in the audio plays No Man's Land and Brotherhood of the Daleks. Ivor Salter had previously played the Morok Commander in The Space Museum and Odysseus in The Myth Makers. Broadcast and reception The story was repeated on BBC1 on 31 August and 1 September 1983, achieving viewing figures of 4.4 and 5.0 million viewers respectively. In the DVD commentary, Peter Davison and Janet Fielding revealed that Black Orchid is not a particular favourite episode of theirs, because they disliked the lack of a science fiction element and thought the script was generally trite. Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping gave the serial a positive review in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), writing, \\"A little piece of 20s whimsy sampled into Doctor Who with surprisingly satisfying results.\\" In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker said that the story had high production values and were disappointed it did not lead to more historicals. In 2012, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times praised the story's variation on the Doctor Who formula and the cast, especially Sutton, who was given more to do. The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn noted that the story was not realistic and paced in a way that not much happened in the first episode, but felt that this decision allowed for leisurely moments between the TARDIS crew. Though he wrote that the low stakes were a refreshing change, he said that the story's problem was its reliance on Agatha Christie-like source material, which led to casual racism and discrimination. DVD Talk's Justin Felix gave Black Orchid three out of five stars, describing it as \\"a breezy excursion into a melodramatic murder mystery\\". Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Terence Dudley, was published by Target Books in September 1986. An unabridged reading of the novelisation by actor Michael Cochrane was released on CD in June 2008 by BBC Audiobooks. =Home media= Black Orchid was released in a twin VHS set with The Visitation in July 1994. On 14 April 2008 it was released on DVD. On 10 December 2018 it was released as part of the Doctor Who: The Collection - Season 19 boxset, which included an optional extended cut of Episode One running over two and a half minutes longer than the televised version at a total of 27:32.  Critical analysis  A book length study of the serial, written by Ian Millsted, was published as part of The Black Archive series from Obverse Books in 2016. The serial was covered in volume 35 of the Doctor Who: The Complete History book series, which reprinted Andrew Pixley's 'Archive' features from Doctor Who Magazine and the various Doctor Who Magazine Special Editions, as well as new articles created specifically for the book.

Mosse's importance lies in his work on Japan's Meiji Constitution and his continuation of Litthauer's Comments on the German Commercial Code.  Biography  Mosse was born into a prominent Jewish family in Gr√§tz, in Prussia's Grand Duchy of Posen. His father, Dr. Markus Mosse, was a noted physician, and the most distinguished of his six brothers was Rudolf Mosse. Mosse attended the gymnasiums in Lissa and in Goben. He then studied law at Berlin University in 1865 thanks to the financial support of his older brothers, and passed his first state examination in 1868, and the second one in 1873. He was a volunteer in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871. He became an assistant judge in 1875, and was gradually elevated to the position of a county court judge at Spandau in 1876. Eventually, he was appointed judge of the state court in Berlin, which was the highest position a Jew was allowed to achieve in Germany at the time. In 1882, at the request of the German government, Mosse met with future Prime Minister of Japan, It≈ç Hirobumi and his group of government officials and scholars, who were touring Europe to research various forms of western style governments, and gave a series of lectures on constitutional law. Mosse is credited with having convinced Ito Hirobumi that the Prussian-style monarchical constitution was the best suited for Japan. In 1886, Mosse was invited to Japan on a three-year contract as a foreign advisor to the Japanese government to assist Ito Hirobumi and Inoue Kowashi in drafting the Constitution of the Empire of Japan. Afterwards, he worked on other important legal drafts, international agreements, and contracts and served as a cabinet advisor in the Home Ministry, assisting Prime Minister Yamagata Aritomo in establishing the draft laws and systems for local government. He lived in Japan from 1886 to 1890. After leaving Japan, Mosse settled in K√∂nigsberg to be a state supreme court judge. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of K√∂nigsberg in 1903 and, during the following year, became honorary professor there for Civil procedural law and Commercial law. After his retirement in 1907, he returned to Berlin where he served on the City Council and advised the Berlin municipal administration on various legal matters. He took part in public affairs of the Jewish community.  Works  New edition of F. Litthauer's Comments on the Commercial Code 1905‚Äì1927.

The white tower seen in the artwork on the inside cover of the booklet is a revamped version of Martin Heemskerck's 16th- century interpretation of the Pharos of Alexandria. The wave seen in the full picture of the artwork is a reflection of Hokusai's The Great Wave off Kanagawa. Release The vinyl edition of Leviathan has a slightly different track listing. The songs \\"I Am Ahab\\" and \\"√çsland\\" are taken out of their respective place and replaced as tracks 7 and 8. Reception Placing Mastodon \\"among the elite of bands\\" on the strength of Leviathan, Avi Pitchon wrote in Terrorizer that the album \\"rampages through in a shining epic flow, the 'crazy' parts never separate from the classic metal parts\\". Online music magazine Pitchfork Media placed Leviathan at number 126 on their list of top 200 albums of the 2000s. In 2009, MetalSucks compiled a list of the \\"21 Best Metal Albums of the 21st Century So Far\\" based on the opinions of various musicians, managers, publicists, label representatives and writers, where Leviathan was placed at number one on the list. The album was honored with a 2004 Metal Storm Award for Best Alternative Metal Album. In 2017, Rolling Stone ranked Leviathan as 46th on their list of 'The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time.' German magazine Rock Hard ranked Leviathan ninth on the list of the 15 most important progressive metal albums.Boris Kaiser/Michael Rensen: Die 15 wichtigsten Progressive-Metal-Alben.

Home has the ZIP code 15747 and is a part of the telephone area code 724. History The community received its name because its first post office was located in the \\"home\\" of postmaster Hugh Cannon in 1834. The author Edward Abbey moved to Home in 1931, having been born in the Indiana hospital and spending the first four-and-a-half years in other towns and villages in the area. Abbey, known for his great depictions of nature and its beauty, was said to have gotten much of his inspiration from growing up in Home. The town was called Kellysburg until the early 1900s. Harry Burkett and his family moved to town in 1918. Harry Burkett started the post office in his home, which led to the town's name: everyone talked about going to the home post office, and eventually the town's name was changed from Kellysburg to Home. In popular culture The town became famous as the setting for an episode of the television show The X-Files entitled \\"Home\\" which originally aired on October 11, 1996. In the episode, Home is depicted as an idyllic \\"Mayberry\\" like town clouded by a reclusive local family with a dark secret. Although the episode was set in the town, it was actually filmed near the Canadian towns of Fort Langley and Surrey, British Columbia.\\"Home\\" (The X-Files) locations on IMDb References Unincorporated communities in Pennsylvania Populated places established in 1834 Unincorporated communities in Indiana County, Pennsylvania 1834 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Home, Pennsylvania"},{"id":"1839978","text":"Stephen E.

He was elected to AOA, the medical honor society. Epstein interned at the New York Hospital, New York, NY.  Career  Epstein served for over 30 years as Chief of the Cardiology Branch of the NHLBI at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD. He then served as Executive Director of the Cardiovascular Research Institute and Director of Vascular Biology Research, at the MedStar Health Research Institute, Washington Hospital Center. He currently serves as Head of Translational Research at the MedStar Heart and Vascular Institute, MedStar Washington Hospital Center. With more than 500 publications in peer‚Äêreviewed medical journals, Epstein is a recognized international authority on angiogenesis and on the application of stem cell strategies for cardiovascular therapeutics. His recent work on stem cell therapy has demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) when administered intravenously to mice with acute myocardial infarction and to mice with ischemic cardiomyopathy, markedly attenuate the progressive development of adverse left ventricular remodeling and deterioration in LV function. He and his associates have also demonstrated that one of the mechanisms responsible for these beneficial effects is a modulation of the excessive immune and inflammatory responses that are triggered by the presence of an injured left ventricle. These observations resulted in the initiation of two clinical trials testing the efficacy of the intravenous injection of MSCs in patients with heart failure. The observations are now being used to inform the development of novel monoclonal antibody strategies to modulate inflammation for treating patients with myocardial infractions, patients with heart failure, and patients with various autoimmune diseases. Epstein and his colleagues have developed a biomarker strategy that identifies patients with coronary artery disease who are at very high near- term risk of experiencing death or an acute myocardial infarction.

It was attacked and destroyed by Oda Nobunaga in the 1570s. This, combined with the surrender of the Ikki's other main fortress, Ishiyama Hongan-ji, several years later, ended the threat the Ikko-ikki posed to Nobunaga and other samurai conquerors. The fortress was situated on a swampy delta, on the border of Owari and Ise Provinces, at the point where three rivers converge, to the southwest of the modern-day city of Nagoya. Nagashima was in fact a number of smaller fortifications surrounding two primary buildings and not a single fortress. Nagashima Castle was built in 1555 by Ito Shigeharu, and seized by the Ikk≈ç-ikki shortly afterwards, in much the same way they had seized a number of other daimy≈ç's holdings. The Gansh≈ç-ji fortified monastery formed the second center of Nagashima's defense. At one time, the area may have been known as \\"Nanashima\\" or \\"seven islands\\". It is currently one island between the Kiso and Nagara Rivers, with Ise Bay at its southern tip. The Oda clan, which controlled nearby lands, was wary of the Ikki's growing power, and engaged them at Ogie Castle in 1569. The Ikki were victorious, and Nobunaga's brother Nobuoki was killed. Nobunaga returned to lay siege to the Ikki's fortress three times, before finally subduing it in 1574 with the help of the Kumano Suigun (Navy) under the control of the Kuki family. He set the wooden structure ablaze, and none of the fortress cathedral's 20,000 inhabitants escaped. According to the members of the Nagashima Historical Society, none of the main castle of Nagashima survived and its true location is unknown. What is believed to be the most probable location is now the site of a junior high school, which was identified in accordance to written descriptions of the area in the 16th century and what is believed to be an old moat. There is a map at the site, next to the school. The reconstructed castle gate was washed away during the Isewan Typhoon in 1959. Gansh≈çji was rebuilt some distance inland. A stone stupa was erected as a memorial to those killed in the burning of the fortress. See also Sieges of Nagashima Notes References Turnbull, Stephen (2003). Japanese Warrior Monks, AD 949‚Äì1603.

The full title of the book is Our Final Hour: A Scientist's Warning: How Terror, Error, and Environmental Disaster Threaten Humankind's Future In This Century - On Earth and Beyond. It was published in the United Kingdom under the more prosaic title Our Final Century: Will the Human Race Survive the Twenty-first Century?. The premise of the book is that the Earth and human survival are in far greater danger from the potential effects of modern technology than is commonly realised, and that the 21st century may be a critical moment in history when humanity's fate is decided. Rees discusses a range of existential risks confronting humanity, and estimates that the probability of extinction before 2100 CE is around 50 percent, based on the possibility of malign or accidental release of destructive technology. Humanity's fate and recommendations for survival In Our Final Hour, Rees predicts that one of the two following outcomes is inevitable for humanity: * Human extinction, as a result of the runaway effects of new technology (e.g. nanotechnology), Superconducting Super Collider type large scale particle accelerators, or uncontrolled scientific research; terrorist or fundamentalist violence; or destruction of the biosphere; or * Human expansion throughout space, by minimising, avoiding or overcoming these problems. In order to avoid human extinction, Rees advocates control of scientific research worldwide, and control of open access to such research. He states that, in the 1990s, Aum Shinrikyo tried unsuccessfully to obtain an Ebola virus sample, which they could now create in their Mount Fuji lab, using ingredients and instructions from the Internet. Rees has long been active in disarmament campaigns, and although he now sees nuclear warfare as a less probable cause of extinction, he advocates arms control as much as control of science and technology (see also World government). More concerning to him now is the possibility of major bioterrorist attacks, as evidenced by his outstanding bet (registered with the Long Bet Project) that such events will occur within the next twenty years. In terms of space exploration and survival through colonization, Rees is an advocate of the free market solution, and believes that the wealthy will push back the frontiers of space. Reviews Review by Oliver Morton in The Guardian  Morton believes that Rees's 50% chance of extinction is too high and states that \\"defences against bioterror will evolve in step with the threat. It is entirely conceivable that there will be no last move, and no final 'game over'\\". * Review by The Telegraph * Review by BBC News * Review by Publishers Weekly * Review by John Derbyshire in The National Review  Derbyshire is convinced by Rees's argument and considers that human extinction does not seem improbable. * Review by The Universe Today which finds the book \\"makes some well-reasoned arguments about the dangers of scientific exploration\\" but is \\"short on solutions that could help guide policy\\". * http://canadiancor.com/final-century-will-human-race-survive-twenty-first- century/ Review by Steven B Kurtz, in FUTURES, doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2004.03.016 Kurtz largely agrees with Rees, but balks at the implied Anthropic Principle. Further readingRees does not object to the probabilistic argument for human extinction offered by the Doomsday argument (as championed by John Leslie in the 1996 book The End of the World: The Science and Ethics of Human Extinction (Routledge, hardcover: , paperback: )), but he does not consider it to describe the practical threats and solutions that he discusses. *In The Singularity is Near, Raymond Kurzweil reaches the same conclusion as Rees on the probability of human extinction within the 21st century. *In the 2004 book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed (Viking Adult, ), Jared Diamond suggests that Sir Martin's hopes of worldwide cooperation in avoiding extinction scenarios may be in vain. *Ronald Wright, who quotes Martin Rees with approval in A Short History of Progress (at p. 125-6), is just as pessimistic - much more so than Jared Diamond - and argues that human history reveals a disastrous series of technological progress traps.

It was named after the original seat of its count, Loon, which is today called Borgloon. During the middle ages the counts moved their court to a more central position in Kuringen, which is today a part of Hasselt, the modern capital of the region. From its beginnings, Loon was associated with the Prince-bishop of Li√®ge and by 1190 the count had come under the bishop's overlordship.Count Gerard of Loon declared himself to hold Loon of the Bishop, in an Imperial Diet. See Vaes pp.32-3. In the fourteenth century, the second time the male line ended, the prince-bishops themselves took over the county directly. Loon approximately represented the Dutch-speaking (archaic ) part of the princedom. All of the Dutch-speaking towns in the Prince-Bishopric, with the status of being so-called \\"Good Cities\\" (), were in Loon, and are in Belgian Limburg today.See for example Vaes p.119. The Dutch speaking cities were specifically called the cit√©s thioises, where \\"thioise\\" is an old word related to English \\"Dutch\\". These were Beringen, Bilzen, Borgloon, Bree, Hamont, Hasselt, Herk-de-Stad, Maaseik, Peer and Stokkem. From its earliest times as a county Loon had lordships in three distinct geographical areas: an eastern part in the Maas river valley (the Frankish Maasau) on the western bank north of Maastricht, including Maaseik; a northern part in the sandy Kempen region (), including Bree; and a southern part within the Dutch- speaking part of the fertile hills of Haspengouw () which includes Borgloon itself. Like other areas which eventually came under the power of the Prince Bishop of Li√®ge, Loon never formally became part of the unified lordship of the \\"Low Countries\\" which united almost all of the Benelux in the late Middle Ages, and continued to unite almost all of today's Belgium under the ancien regime. Loon and other Li√®ge lordships only joined their neighbours when they all became part of France during the French revolution. After the Battle of Waterloo, they remained connected in the new United Kingdom of the Netherlands. In 1839, the old territory of Loon became the approximate basis of a new province, Limburg, within the new Kingdom of Belgium. This map shows the medieval County of Loon in red, with modern provincial (grey) and national borders (black). The light red zones were under Loon and another lord jointly. Origins Map of the Bishopric of Li√®ge with 't Land van Loen, Joan Blaeu, Atlas Maior, 1645 Like many of the counties in the region, records mentioning the county of Loon begin in the early 11th century, but these give only indications of how the county came to be. The immediately preceding generations had seen many rebellions, confiscations, and expulsions. The whole region of Lower Lotharingia had been part of a separate kingdom, but it no longer had a king. The eastern and western kingdoms of the old Carolingian dynasty, the forerunners of later France and Germany, contested for control, together with the local magnates. By the year 1000, the area was under lasting control of the eastern \\"Teutonic\\" kingdom, and not only Loon, but also other well-known counties such as Hainaut and Brabant, were developing into the forms known in the later Middle Ages. In the 10th century, these counties were put together from component parts with complex histories, that are now difficult to reconstruct. In the early tenth century, at least until 939, it has traditionally been proposed (for example by Christophe Butkens, and much later L√©on Vanderkindere) that the so-called Regnarid dynasty had controlled all or most of these areas. In particular, a count named Rudolf, who is proposed by these historians to be the younger brother of Reginar III, had a county in the area of Maaseik in 952.Charter of 952: MGH DD Otto I p.235 This county of Rudolf, called Hufte or Huste in the two medieval documents which mention it, apparently included lands very close to Borgloon itself, according to a charter estimated to be from 958/959.Dating of 958/9: Dierkens, A., ‚ÄòQuelques r√©flexions sur l'abbaye de Saint-Trond √† la fin du IXe et au Xe si√®cle‚Äô, In: Studia Adriaan Verhulst (1995) 371 note 54. The charter is transcribed in the Cartulaire de l'abbaye de Saint-Trond Piot edition, Volume 1, pp.6-7 Furthermore, a Count Rudolf, perhaps the same one, also ruled a neighbouring county to the southwest of Borgloon, outside the future county of Loon, based in Avernas.Avernas and its boundary with Hufte/Huste is mentioned in the already cited charter of 958/9. It is also mentioned as being ruled by a Count Rudolf in a charter which is reproduced in Hackeng, Het middeleeuwse grondbezit van het Sint-Servaaskapittel te Maastricht in de regio Maas-Rijn, nr. 21, 271 pdf; and Beyer et al. eds., Urkundenbuch zur Geschichte der jetzt die Preussischen Regierungsbezirke Coblenz und Trier bildenden mittelrheinischen Territorien, 1, nr.184, 246 link. In 958 Reginar III was exiled, and although the two sons of Reginar III returned in 973, and began slowly establishing the power bases that eventually became the counties of Hainaut and Leuven, the fate of their proposed uncle Rudolf is unknown. However, Bishop Balderic II, brother of Count Gilbert of Loon, the first certain count, had common ancestry with Lambert I, Count of Louvain, a descendant of the Reginarids.Gesta episcoporum Cameracensium, lib. III, ch. 5, M.G.H., SS., t. vii, p. 467-468. According to the most widely accepted hypothesis, developed by Joseph Daris, L√©on Vanderkindere, and up-dated by Jean Baerten and others, the counts of Loon, although related to the Regnarids, were actually members of the \\"Balderics family\\", descendants of Count Ricfrid. This family had strong links to the Ottonian dynasty in Germany while the Regnarids were seen as rebels, and two members of this family named Balderic (or Balderich, Palderih, etc.) had already held the powerful bishoprics in Utrecht and Li√®ge at different times in the 10th century. Daris and Vanderkindere's proposal stemmed from the discovery of a marriage of a sister of the exile Reginar III with Count Nevelong, a son of Ricfrid, who is known to have had children named Rudolf, and Balderic I (Bishop of Li√®ge 953-959). This family was therefore proposed as a link between Loon's origins and both the earlier Reginars who had apparently held lordships near Maaseik and Borgloon, as well as to two earlier bishops named Balderic. Vanderkindere specifically proposed that Giselbert the first definite count of Loon was the son of the younger Count Rudolf, not the Regnarid, but his nephew the son of Nevelong. There have been chronological concerns raised about this unproven proposal, because the one record of Rudolf as a boy in 943 is so much earlier than any definite record of Count Giselbert and his brothers in the next century. Furthermore, the only medieval source to mention a parent for Count Giselbert calls him Otto.Gestorum Abbatem Trudonensium Continuatio Tertia 1007, MGH SS X, p.382 Although this source is not considered perfectly reliable for this period, Hein Jongbloed has proposed that a record for an Otto in Ghent might correspond to this ancestor.See Jongbloed (2008) \\"Flamenses\\" Bijdragen en Mededelingen Gelre p.50. The primary source mentioning Otto is the Gestorum Abbatem Trudonensium Continuatio Tertia 1007, MGH SS X, p. 382. Jongbloed proposed the existence of this Otto son of Bertha based on witness lists. Van Winter on the other hand, has proposed that there may have been an Otto who was son of Rudolf, and father to the first count and his brothers.J.M. Van Winter (1981) \\"De voornaamste adelijke geslachten in de Nederlanden in de 10de en 11de eeuw\\" in Blok, Algemene geschiedenis der Nederlanden, cited by Jongbloed. Whoever his parents were, the first certain Count (Dutch graaf, Latin comes, French comte) of Loon was the 11th century Giselbert (modern Dutch Gijsbert, equivalent of modern English and French \\"Gilbert\\"). Exactly what territory he held is still uncertain, and his brother Arnulf is also mentioned as a count in various records. Although all of the charters which describe the brothers as siblings of bishop Balderic II of Li√®ge are later forgeries, there is considered to be enough evidence to be accept this relationship.There are many mentions of the relationship, and medieval forgeries were often wholly or partly based on older real documents. : \\"Les documents qui √©clairent les origines du pr√©lat ‚Äî documents diplomatiques faux ou suspects, sources narratives tr√®s tardives ‚Äî sont loin d‚Äôoffrir toutes les garanties. Nous estimons cependant que leur t√©moignage se fait l‚Äô√©cho d‚Äôune tradition bas√©e sur la r√©alit√©.\\" Vaes, following Baerten, emphasizes that in 1031, Bishop Reginard, Balderic II's successor, describes a grant made in the previous generation where Gislebert was named as both brother to Balderic and count of Loon. Kupper says that this document is also a false copy, though probably based on an older real act. \\"Cet acte est un faux qui se base probablement sur un document de 1026-1028\\" A charter dated 24 Jan 1040 mentions a \\"county of Haspinga in the pagus Haspengouw\\", which had been the possession of count Arnold, understood to be the brother of Giselbert, also known as Arnulf. With this much debated charter Emperor Henry III granted this county to the Cathedral of Saint-Lambert in Li√®ge.MGH DD H III 35 p.45 (comitatum Arnoldi comitis nomine Haspinga in pago Haspingowi). It raises the question of what this county within the pagus of the same name implied both geographically and legally. Furthermore, there is no record of Arnulf as count of Loon. Haspinga has been interpreted as being either the same as the county of Loon () or as a lordship which held Loon under it (Baerten, and others), although it might simply have been one geographical part of Hesbaye, different to the one his brother held. Connected to this open question, not only is the parentage of Giselbert, Arnulf and Balderic unknown, but also their connection to the next two count brothers, Emmo and Otto, is considered uncertain. They are thought to be the sons of either Giselbert or Arnulf. While Giselbert is the obvious proposal, lean towards the position of Verhelst, and favor Arnulf as their father. A major argument for the position of Verhelst is that Emmo named his son and heir Arnulf/Arnold, and the name Giselbert was never used by his descendants. (Otto the brother of Emmo named his son Giselbert, but according to this proposal this name commemorates another Giselbert who was advocatus of St Truiden, as were both Otto and his son.) Another important charter in discussions about the origins of the County of Loon is the 1078 grant by Countess Ermengarde to the Bishop of Li√®ge, of allodial land in key places in the Count of Loon. Her possessions can not be explained by her proposed ancestry, or her known husband, and so it has long been suggested (for example by Vanderkindere, Baerten, and Kupper) that she must have first married a Count of Loon, normally presumed to be Arnold, because he is normally presumed to have had no heirs. discusses this grant in detail. History In the generation after the 3 brothers Balderic, Gilbert, and Arnulf, Count Emmo became the next count of Loon while his brother Count Otto was advocatus of the Abbey of St Truiden, and the ancestor of the first line of counts of Duras, perhaps through his wife Oda. The county of Duras was inherited by Otto's son Giselbert, and in turn by his son Otto. It eventually became part of Loon, under Count Gerard in the 1190s. Count Arnold (or Arnulf) I, the son of Emmo, is according to Baerten (1969 p. 40), the first Count of Loon for whom we can discuss any political activity. In 1106 he was able to strengthen his position, when he acquired the possessions of the extinct Counts of Rieneck through his marriage. He also probably built the motte-and- bailey castle which was at Borgloon during the middle ages.Vaes p.129 His son Arnold II, Count of Loon, founded the Abbey of Averbode. The son and heir of Arnold II was Louis (Dutch Lodewijk) I. He founded Averbode Abbey by charter dated 1135, and was count of Loon, Stadtgraf of Mainz, and count of Rieneck, both in modern Germany. He increased Loon's territory adding Kolmont (now in Tongeren) together with Bilzen. He strengthened the fort there and gave the city freedoms. He also did the same in Brustem (now in St Truiden), which came under threat as a Loon enclave surrounded by the County of Duras. Count Gerard (sometimes incorrectly called Gerard \\"II\\"), the next count of Loon and Rieneck, fortified Brustem and Kolmont, and moved the capital of the county to Kuringen. There he founded Herkenrode Abbey, for women living according to the Cistercian rule. In Loon, the enduring conflict with his Li√®ge overlords culminated in an 1179 campaign by Prince-Bishop Rudolf of Z√§hringen, whose troops devastated the county's capital at Borgloon in 1179. In 1193 he also acquired the county of Duras and advocacy of the abbey of Sint-Truiden, but had to accept Brabant's suzerainty over those lands. This area gave power over abbey lands in Sint-Truiden, Halen, and Herk de Stad, effectively defining what is today still the southwestern border of Belgian Limburg. Gerard's son Louis II was heir, but Rieneck went to another son, Gerard, Count of Rieneck. The counties of Rieneck and Loon were re-united eventually under Gerard of Rieneck's son Louis III of Loon, but he then divided them again, giving Loon to his brother Arnold IV. By marriage, Count Arnold IV acquired the French- speaking County of Chiny in 1227, and brought the main line of the counts of Loon to the high point of its territorial expansion. The comital male line became extinct with the death of Louis IV of Loon in 1336 and the Loon and Chiny estates were at first inherited by the noble House of Sponheim at Heinsberg with the consent of the Li√®ge bishop. In 1362 Prince-Bishop Engelbert III of the Marck nevertheless seized Loon and finally incorporated it into the Li√®ge territory in 1366. The county remained a separate entity (quartier) within Li√®ge, whose prince-bishops assumed the comital title. When the bishopric was annexed by Revolutionary France in 1795, the county of Loon was also disbanded and an adjusted version of the territory became part of the French d√©partement of Meuse-Inf√©rieure, along with Dutch Limburg to the east of the Maas. After the defeat of Napoleon, the d√©partement became part of the new United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815, and received its modern name of Limburg as a way for the kingdom to preserve the old title of the medieval Duchy of Limburg, which was nearby. However, in 1830, Belgium was created, splitting the Kingdom, and the position of Limburg and Luxemburg became a cause of conflict between the two resulting Kingdoms. In 1839, under international arbitration, it was finally decided to split Limburg and Luxemburg into their two modern parts. The western part of Limburg, corresponds roughly to the old County of Loon, and became part of Belgium. Both parts kept their new name of Limburg. Counts of Loon Count Otto (doubted).

They are dwarf cichlids that mostly feed on tiny animals and have breeding behaviors that vary depending on the exact species. Range, conservation status and habitat Apistogramma are exclusively found in tropical and subtropical South America in the lowlands east of the Andes. The highest richness is in the western Amazon Basin and Orinoco Basin, but there are also species in the Guianan Shield, eastern Amazon Basin, rivers flowing into the Atlantic in northern Brazil (Tocantins‚ÄìAraguaia to Parna√≠ba) and the R√≠o de la Plata Basin.Kullander, S.O., and E.J.G. Ferreira (2005). Two new species of Apistogramma Regan (Teleostei: Cichlidae) from the rio Trombetas, Par√° State, Brazil. Neotrop. ichthyol. 3(3). Although a few species are widespread, most members of this genus have small ranges.Tougard, C., C.R.G. D√°vila, U. R√∂mer, F. Duponchelle, F. Cerqueira, E. Paradis, B. Guinand, C.A. Ch√°vez, V.

PLoS ONE 12(9): e0182618. Few members of the genus have been evaluated by the IUCN, mostly either ranking as least concern (not threatened) or data deficient (limited available data prevents an evaluation), but some of the highly localized Apistogramma species likely are threatened.R√∂mer, U., Duponchelle, F., Vela Diaz, A., Garcia Davilla, C., Sirvas, S., Diaz Catchay, C. & Renno, J.-F.

Vertebrate Zoology, 65 (3): 305‚Äì332. Primary threats to their survival are deforestation (causing changes in their microhabitat) and pollution (for example by oil drilling or mining). Apistogramma generally inhabit streams, or edges of rivers or lakes. Most prefer sheltered habitats with leaf litter on the bottom in water with little movement and a shallow depth, up to about , although a few species occur deeper, in fast-flowing water, in more open habitats or at the surface among floating plants.Staeck, W., and I. Schindler (2019). Apistogramma psammophila ‚Äì a new geophagine dwarf cichlid (Teleostei: Cichlidae) from the Rio Atabapo drainage in Colombia and Venezuela. Vertebrate Zoology 69(1): 103-110. Appearance Apistogramma are dwarf cichlids with adults reaching between in standard length depending on exact species. Most species are strongly sexually dimorphic, with males generally larger than females and possessing different color patterns than the females (which at least when breeding are most frequently yellow with blackish markings); in a few species this pattern is reversed or the sexes are rather similar.Rodrigues, R.R., J. Zuanon, K. Del-Claro, and L.N. Carvalho (2012). Reproductive behavior of the Amazonian dwarf cichlid Apistogramma hippolytae Kullander, 1982: offsetting costs and benefits. Acta Ethologica 15(1): 1-7. . Additionally, they often change color depending on behavior, for example when looking for food, breeding or during aggressive encounters.Rodrigues, R.R., L.N. Carvalho, J. Zuanon, and K. Del-Claro (2009). Color changing and behavioral context in the Amazonian Dwarf Cichlid Apistogramma hippolytae (Perciformes). Neotrop. ichthyol. 7(4). A few species, including A. agassizii, A. cacatuoides, A hongsloi and A. macmasteri, have been selectively bred by aquarists to achieve brighter colors than the natural, wild forms. Behavior Apistogramma are omnivores, but tending towards micropredatory. Their main food items consist of aquatic insect larvae and other small invertebrates, fish fry, algae and plant debris. Brood care is highly developed, as in most cichlids. Nearly all Apistogramma species spawn in crevices (small caves), typically in holes in sunken logs or branches, or in leaf litter aggregations. A number of breeding strategies exist in the genus. Some species breed in polygamous harems, while other species form monogamous pairs. Three of the described species, A. barlowi, A. megastoma and A. pantalone, practice mouthbrooding, either by both parents or only by the female. In most cases, regardless of the breeding strategy, the female is more highly involved with care of the eggs and fry, whilst the male defends a territory from predators. The sex of the fry is affected by the water conditions: In all species where it has been studied warmer water results in more males and in some species more acidic water (lower pH) also results in more males.R√∂mer, U., and W. Beisenherz (1996). Environmental determination of sex in Apistogramma (Cichlidae) and two other freshwater fishes (Teleostei). Journal of Fish Biology 48(4): 714-725. Ospina-√Ålvarez, N., and F.

Zoologica Scripta 34(6): 627‚Äì651. There are currently 93 recognized Apistogramma species, making it the most species-rich genus of cichlid in the Americas, together with Crenicichla. New species of Apistogramma are regularly described, and undescribed species‚Äîsometimes cryptic‚Äîare known to exist in the genus.Carvalho, A.P.C., R.A. Collins, J.G. Mart√≠nez, I.P. Farias, and T. Hrbek (2019). From shallow to deep divergences: mixed messages from Amazon Basin cichlids. Hydrobiologia 832(1): 317‚Äì329. Several of the recognized species occur in more than one form, and some of these actually may represent separate species, as appears to be the case for the \\"Papagayo\\" and \\"Peb√°s\\" forms, both typically included in A. ortegai. A comprehensive taxonomic review of the genus is necessary. The genus is sometimes divided into subgroups based on the appearance and phylogenetic relationship of the various species. * Apistogramma acrensis Staeck, 2003 * Apistogramma agassizii (Steindachner, 1875) * Apistogramma aguarico R√∂mer & Hahn, 2013R√∂mer, U. & Hahn, I.

This should not be confused with the Republic of China under Chiang Kai-shek, which was fighting with the Allies of World War II against Japan. The country was ruled as a one-party republic under Wang Jingwei, a very high-ranking former Kuomintang (KMT) official. The region that it would administer was initially seized by Japan throughout the late 1930s with the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Wang, a rival of Chiang Kai-shek and member of the pro- peace faction of the KMT, defected to the Japanese side and formed a collaborationist government in occupied Nanking (Nanjing) (the traditional capital of China) in 1940. The new state claimed the entirety of China during its existence, portraying itself as the legitimate inheritors of the Xinhai Revolution and Sun Yat-sen's legacy as opposed to Chiang Kai-shek's government in Chunking (Chongqing), but effectively only Japanese-occupied territory was under its direct control. Its international recognition was limited to other members of the Anti-Comintern Pact, of which it was a signatory. The Reorganized National Government existed until the end of World War II and the surrender of Japan in August 1945, at which point the regime was dissolved and many of its leading members were executed for treason. The state was formed by combining the previous Reformed Government (1938‚Äì1940) and Provisional Government (1937‚Äì1940) of the Republic of China, puppet regimes which ruled the central and northern regions of China that were under Japanese control, respectively. Unlike Wang Jingwei's government, these regimes were not much more than arms of the Japanese military leadership and received no recognition even from Japan itself or its allies. However, after 1940 the former territory of the Provisional Government remained semi-autonomous from Nanjing's control, under the name \\"North China Political Council\\". The region of Mengjiang (puppet government in Inner Mongolia) was under Wang Jingwei's government only nominally. His regime was also hampered by the fact that the powers granted to it by the Japanese were extremely limited, and this was only partly changed with the signing of a new treaty in 1943 which gave it more sovereignty from Japanese control. The Japanese largely viewed it as not an end in itself but the means to an end, a bridge for negotiations with Chiang Kai-shek, which led them to often treat Wang with indifference. Names The regime is informally also known as the Nanjing Nationalist Government (), the Nanjing Regime, or by its leader Wang Jingwei Regime (). As the government of the Republic of China and subsequently of the People's Republic of China regard the regime as illegal, it is also commonly known as Wang's Puppet Regime () or Puppet Nationalist Government () in Greater China. Other names used are the Republic of China-Nanjing, China-Nanjing, or New China.  Background  While Wang Jingwei was widely regarded as a favorite to inherit Sun Yat-sen's position as leader of the Nationalist Party, based upon his faithful service to the party throughout the 1910s and 20s and based on his unique position as the one who accepted and recorded Dr. Sun's last will and testament, he was rapidly overtaken by Chiang Kai-shek. By the 1930s, Wang Jingwei had been taken the position Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Nationalist Government under Chiang Kai-shek, a position that put him in control over the deteriorating Sino-Japanese relationship. While Chiang Kai-shek focused his primary attentions against the Communist Party of China, Wang Jingwei diligently toiled to preserve the peace between China and Japan, repeatedly stressing the need for a period of extended peace in order for China to elevate itself economically and militarily to the levels of its neighbor and the other Great powers of the world. Yet despite his efforts, Wang was unable to find a peaceful solution to prevent the Japanese from commencing an invasion into Chinese territory. Wang Jingwei was head of the Reorganized National Government. By April 1938, the national conference of the KMT, held in retreat at the temporary capital of Chongqing, appointed Wang as vice-president of the party, reporting only to Chiang Kai-shek himself. Meanwhile, the Japanese advance into Chinese territory as part of the Second Sino-Japanese War continued unrelentingly. From his new position, Wang urged Chiang Kai-shek to pursue a peace agreement with Japan on the sole condition that the hypothetical deal \\"did not interfere with the territorial integrity of China\\". Chiang Kai-shek was adamant, however, that he would countenance no surrender, and that it was his position that, were China to be united completely under his control, the Japanese could readily be repulsed. As a result, Chiang continued to devote his primary attention to eradicating the Communists and ending the Chinese Civil War. On December 18, 1938, Wang Jingwei and several of his closest supporters resigned from their positions and boarded a plane to Hanoi in order to seek alternative means of ending the war. From this new base, Wang began pursuit of a peaceful resolution to the conflict independent of the Nationalist Party in exile. In June 1939, Wang and his supporters began negotiating with the Japanese for the creation of a new Nationalist Government which could end the war despite Chiang's objections. To this end, Wang sought to discredit the Nationalists in Chongqing on the basis that they represented not the republican government envisioned by Dr. Sun, but rather a \\"one-party dictatorship\\", and subsequently call together a Central Political Conference back to the capital of Nanjing in order to formally transfer control over the party away from Chiang Kai-shek. These efforts were stymied by Japanese refusal to offer backing for Wang and his new government. Ultimately, Wang Jingwei and his allies would establish their almost entirely powerless new party and government in Nanjing in 1940, in the hope that Tokyo might eventually be willing to negotiate a deal for peace, which, though painful, might allow China to survive. Wang and his group were also damaged early on by the defection of the diplomat Gao Zongwu, who played a critical role in arranging Wang's defection after two years of negotiations with the Japanese, in January 1940. He had become disillusioned and believed that Japan did not see China as an equal partner, taking with him the documents of the Basic Treaty that Japan had signed with the Wang Jingwei government. He revealed them to the Kuomintang press, becoming a major propaganda coup for Chiang Kai- shek and discrediting Wang's movement in the eyes of the public as mere puppets of the Japanese. Political boundaries Menchiang was incorporated in 1940 (light green) In theory, the Reorganized National Government controlled all of China with the exception of Manchukuo, which it recognized as an independent state. In actuality, at the time of its formation, the Reorganized Government controlled only Jiangsu, Anhui, and the north sector of Zhejiang, all being Japanese-controlled territories after 1937. Thereafter, the Reorganized Government's actual borders waxed and waned as the Japanese gained or lost territory during the course of the war. During the December 1941 Japanese offensive the Reorganized Government extended its control over Hunan, Hubei, and parts of Jiangxi provinces. The port of Shanghai and the cities of Hankou and Wuchang were also placed under control of the Reformed Government after 1940. The Japanese-controlled provinces of Shandong and Hebei were theoretically part of this political entity, although they were actually administered by the Commander of the Japanese Northern China Area Army under a separate Japanese-controlled government based in Beijing. Likewise, the southern sectors had their own Japanese military commander and government based in Guangzhou. *Jiangsu: ; capital: Zhenjiang (also included the national capital of Nanking (Nanjing)) *Anhui: ; capital: Anqing *Zhejiang: ; capital: Hangzhou According to other sources, total extension of territory during 1940 period was 1,264,000 km2. In 1940 an agreement was signed between the Inner Mongolian puppet state of Mengjiang and the Nanjing regime, incorporating the former into the latter as an autonomous part.  History  = Shanghai as de facto capital, 1939‚Äì1941 = With Nanjing still rebuilding itself after the devastating assault and occupation by the Japanese Imperial Army, the fledgling Reorganized Nationalist Government turned to Shanghai as its primary focal point. With its key role as both an economic and media center for all China, close affiliation to Western Imperial powers even despite the Japanese invasion, and relatively sheltered position from attacks by KMT and Communist forces alike, Shanghai offered both sanctuary and opportunity for Wang and his allies' ambitions. Once in Shanghai, the new regime quickly moved to take control over those publications already supportive of Wang and his peace platform, while also engaging in violent, gang-style attacks against rival news outlets. By November 1940, the Reorganized Nationalist Party had secured enough local support to begin hostile takeovers of both Chinese courts and banks still under nominal control by the KMT in Chongqing or Western powers. Buoyed by this rapid influx of seized collateral, the Reorganized Government under its recently appoint Finance Minister, Zhou Fohai, was able to issue a new currency for circulation. Ultimately however, the already limited economic influence garnered by the new banknotes was further diminished by Japanese efforts to contain the influence of the new regime, at least for a time, to territories firmly under Japanese control like Shanghai and other isolated regions of the Yangtze Valley. =Foundation of the Reorganized Government in Nanjing= Wall bearing a government slogan that proclaims: \\"Support Mr. Wang Jingwei!\\" Water Resource Committee of Wang Jingwei's puppet government The administrative structure of the Reorganized National Government included a Legislative Yuan and an Executive Yuan. Both were under the president and head of state Wang Jingwei. However, actual political power remained with the commander of the Japanese Central China Area Army and Japanese political entities formed by Japanese political advisors. After obtaining Japanese approval to establish a national government in the summer of 1940, Wang Jingwei ordered the 6th National Congress of the Kuomintang to establish this government in Nanjing. The dedication occurred in the Conference Hall, and both the \\"blue-sky white-sun red-earth\\" national flag and the \\"blue-sky white- sun\\" Kuomintang flag were unveiled, flanking a large portrait of Sun Yat-sen. On the day the new government was formed, and just before the session of the \\"Central Political Conference\\" began, Wang visited Sun's tomb in Nanjing's Purple Mountain to establish the legitimacy of his power as Sun's successor. Wang had been a high-level official of the Kuomintang government and, as a confidant to Sun, had transcribed Sun's last will, the Zongli's Testament. To discredit the legitimacy of the Chongqing government, Wang adopted Sun's flag in the hope that it would establish him as the rightful successor to Sun and bring the government back to Nanjing. A principal goal of the new regime was to portray itself as the legitimate continuation of the former Nationalist government, despite the Japanese occupation. To this end, the Reorganized government frequently sought to revitalize and expand the former policies of the Nationalist government, often to mixed success. = Efforts to expand Japanese recognition = Advertisement of congratulation towards the establishment of the new Nationalist government on Taiwan Nichi Nichi Shimp≈ç While Wang had been successful in securing from Japan a \\"basic treaty\\" recognizing the foundation of his new party in November 1940, the produced document granted the Reorganized Nationalist Government almost no powers whatsoever. This initial treaty precluded any possibility for Wang to act as intermediary with Chiang Kai-shek and his forces in securing a peace agreement in China. Likewise, the regime was afforded no extra administrative powers in occupied China, save those few previously carved out in Shanghai. Indeed, official Japanese correspondence regarded the Nanjing regime as trivially important, and urged any and all token representatives stationed with Wang and his allies to dismiss all diplomatic efforts by the new government which could not directly contribute to a total military victory over Chiang and his forces. Hoping to expand the treaty in such a way as to be useful, Wang formally traveled to Tokyo in June 1941 in order to meet with prime minister Fumimaro Konoe and his cabinet to discuss new terms and agreements. Unfortunately for Wang, his visit coincided with the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, a move which further emboldened officials in Tokyo to pursue total victory in China, rather than accept a peace deal. In the end, Konoe eventually agreed to provide a substantial loan to the Nanjing government as well as increased sovereignty; neither of which came to fruition, and indeed, neither of which were even mentioned to military commanders stationed in China. As a slight conciliation, Wang was successful in persuading the Japanese to secure official recognition for the Nanjing Government from the other Axis Powers. = Breakthrough, 1943 = As the Japanese offensive stalled around the Pacific, conditions remained generally consistent under Wang Jingwei's government. The regime continued to represent itself as the legitimate government of China, continued to appeal to Chiang Kai-shek to seek a peace deal, and continued to chafe under the extremely limited sovereignty afforded by the Japanese occupiers. Yet by 1943, Japanese leaders including Hideki Tojo, recognizing that the tide of war was turning against them, sought new ways to reinforce the thinly stretched Japanese forces. To this end, Tokyo finally found it expedient to fully recognize Wang Jingwei's government as a full ally, and a replacement Pact of Alliance was drafted for the basic treaty. This new agreement granted the Nanjing government markedly enhanced administrative control over its own territory, as well as increased ability to make limited self-decisions. Despite this windfall, the deal came far too late for the Reorganized government to have sufficient resources to take advantage of its new powers, and Japan was in no condition to offer aid to its new partner. = War on Opium = As a result of general chaos and wartime various profiteering efforts of the conquering Japanese armies, already considerable illegal opium smuggling operations expanded greatly in the Reorganized Nation Government's territory. Indeed, Japanese forces themselves became arguably the largest and most widespread traffickers within the territory under the auspices of semi-official narcotics monopolies. While initially too politically weak to make inroads into the Japanese operations, as the war began to turn against them, the Japanese government sought to incorporate some collaborationist governments more actively into the war effort. To this end in October 1943 the Japanese government signed a treaty with the Reorganized Nationalist Government of China offering them a greater degree of control over their own territory. As a result, Wang Jingwei and his government were able to gain some increased control over the opium monopolies. Negotiations by Chen Gongbo were successful in reaching an agreement to cut opium imports from Mongolia in half, as well as an official turnover of state-sponsored monopolies from Japan over to the Reorganized Nationalist Government. Yet, perhaps due to financial concerns, the regime sought only limited reductions in the distribution of opium throughout the remainder of the war. =The Nanjing Government and the northern Chinese areas= Area of control of the invading Japanese forces The Beijing administration (East Yi Anti-Communist Autonomous Administration) was under the commander-in-chief of the Japanese Northern China Area Army until the Yellow River area fell inside the sphere of influence of the Japanese Central China Area Army. During this same period the area from middle Zhejiang to Guangdong was administered by the Japanese North China Area Army. These small, largely independent fiefdoms had local money and local leaders, and frequently squabbled. Wang Jingwei traveled to Tokyo in 1941 for meetings. In Tokyo the Reorganized National Government Vice President Zhou Fohai commented to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper that the Japanese establishment was making little progress in the Nanjing area. This quote provoked anger from Kumataro Honda, the Japanese ambassador in Nanjing. Zhou Fohai petitioned for total control of China's central provinces by the Reorganized National Government. In response, Imperial Japanese Army Lt. Gen. Teiichi Suzuki was ordered to provide military guidance to the Reorganized National Government, and so became part of the real power that lay behind Wang's rule. With the permission of the Japanese Army, a monopolistic economic policy was applied, to the benefit of Japanese zaibatsu and local representatives. Though these companies were supposedly treated the same as local Chinese companies by the government, the president of the Yuan legislature in Nanjing, Chen Gongbo, complained that this was untrue to the Kaiz≈ç Japanese review. The Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China also featured its own embassy in Yokohama, Japan (as did Manchukuo).  Government and politics  = International recognition and foreign relations = Wang Jingwei, Japanese ambassador Abe Nobuyuki, and Manchukuo ambassador Zang Shiyi sign the joint declaration, 30 November 1940 Wang Jingwei with ambassador Heinrich Georg Stahmer at the German embassy in 1941 Unused example of a Wang Jingwei regime passport, circa 1941 The Nanjing Nationalist Government received little international recognition as it was seen as a Japanese puppet state, being recognized only by Japan and the rest of the Axis powers. Initially, its main sponsor, Japan, hoped to come to a peace accord with Chiang Kai-shek and held off official diplomatic recognition for the Wang Jingwei regime for eight months after its founding, not establishing formal diplomatic relations with the National Reorganized Government until 30 November 1940. The Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty was signed on 20 November 1940, by which Japan recognised the Nationalist Government, and it also included a Japan‚ÄìManchukuo‚ÄìChina joint declaration by which China recognized the Empire of Great Manchuria and the three countries pledged to create a \\"New Order in East Asia.\\"Signing of Japan-Manchukuo-China Joint Declaration.Chinese puppet government travel document . Published 23 September 2016. Retrieved 19 December 2017. The United States and Britain immediately denounced the formation of the government, seeing it as a tool of Japanese imperialism. In July 1941, after negotiations by Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, the Nanjing Government was recognized as the government of China by Germany and Italy. Soon after, Spain, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Denmark also recognized and established relations with the Wang Jingwei regime as the government of China. China under the Reorganized National Government also became a signatory of the Anti-Comintern Pact on 25 November 1941. After Japan established diplomatic relations with the Holy See in 1942, they and their ally Italy pressured Pope Pius XII to recognize the Nanjing regime and allow a Chinese envoy to be appointed to the Vatican, but he refused to give in to these pressures. Instead the Vatican came to an informal agreement with Japan that their apostolic delegate in Beijing would pay visits to Catholics in the Nanjing government's territory. The Pope also ignored the suggestion of the aforementioned apostolic delegate, Mario Zanin, who recommended in October 1941 that the Vatican recognize the Wang Jingwei regime as the legitimate government of China. Zanin would remain in the Wang Jingwei regime's territory as apostolic delegate while another bishop in Chongqing was to represent Catholic interests in Chiang Kai-shek's territory.The \\"Magic\\" Background to Pearl Harbor, Volume 4. Japanese diplomatic cables published by US Department of Defense, p. A-460. Vichy France, despite being aligned with the Axis, resisted Japanese pressure and also refused to recognize the Wang Jingwei regime, with French diplomats in China remaining accredited to the government of Chiang Kai-shek. The Reorganized National Government had its own Foreign Section or Ministry of Foreign Affairs for managing international relations, although it was short on personnel.The \\"Magic\\" Background to Pearl Harbor, Volume 4. Japanese diplomatic cables published by US Department of Defense, pp. A-456‚ÄìA-465. On 9 January 1943, the Reorganized National Government signed the \\"Treaty on Returning Leased Territories and Repealing Extraterritoriality Rights\\" with Japan, which abolished all foreign concessions within occupied China. Reportedly the date was originally to have been later that month, but was moved to January 9 to be before the United States concluded a similar treaty with Chiang Kai-shek's government. The Nanjing Government then took control of all of the international concessions in Shanghai and its other territories. Later that year Wang Jingwei attended the Greater East Asia Conference as the Chinese representative. The Wang Jingwei government sent Chinese athletes to compete at the 1940 East Asian Games held in Tokyo for the 2600th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Empire by Emperor Jimmu, which were also a replacement for the cancelled 1940 Summer Olympics, including the national football team. None of the top Chinese players were on the team. = State ideology = After Japan's pivot to joining the Axis powers and signing the Tripartite Pact, Wang Jingwei's government promoted the idea of pan-Asianism directed against the West, aimed at establishing a \\"New Order in East Asia\\" together with Japan, Manchukuo, and other Asian nations that would expel Western imperialist powers from China and the whole region, particularly the \\"Anglo-Saxons\\" (the U.S. and Britain) that dominated large parts of Asia. Wang Jingwei used pan-Asianism, basing his views on Sun Yat-sen advocating for Asian people to unite against the West in the early 20th century, partly to justify his efforts at working together with Japan. He claimed it was natural for Japan and China to have good relations and cooperation because of their close affinity, describing their conflicts as a temporary aberration in their history. Furthermore, the government believed in the unity of all Asian nations with Japan as their leader as the only way to achieve their goals of removing European imperialist powers from Asia. There was no official description of which Asian peoples were considered to be included in this, but Wang, members of the Propaganda Ministry, and other officials of his regime writing for collaborationist media had different interpretations, at times listing Japan, China, Manchukuo, Thailand, the Philippines, Burma, Nepal, India, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Arabia as potential members of an \\"East Asian League.\\" From 1940 on the Wang Jingwei government depicted World War II as a struggle by Asians against Westerners, more specifically the Anglo-American powers. The Reorganized National Government had a Propaganda Ministry and controlled the local media, which was used to disseminate pan-Asianist and anti-Western propaganda. British and American diplomats in Shanghai and Nanjing noted by 1940 that the Wang Jingwei-controlled press was publishing anti-Western campaigns. These campaigns were aided by the Japanese and also reflected pan-Asian thought as promoted by Japanese thinkers, which intensified after the start of the Pacific War in December 1941. Articles were published in local newspapers and journals that listed historic atrocities committed by Western countries against native peoples in their colonies. Chu Minyi, the minister of foreign affairs of the Nanjing Government, asserted in an article written shortly after Pearl Harbor that the Sino-Japanese conflict and other wars among Asians were the result of manipulations by the Western powers. Lin Baisheng, the minister of propaganda from 1940 to 1944, also made these claims in his speeches. Since Japan was aligned with Germany, Italy, and other European Axis countries, the Nanjing Government's propaganda did not portray the conflict as a war against all white people and focused on the U.S. and Britain in particular. Their newspapers like Republican Daily praised the German people as a great race for their technological and organizational advancements and praised the Nazis for turning Germany into a great power over the past decade. The publications of the Nanjing Government also agreed with the anti-Jewish views held by Nazi Germany, with Wang Jingwei and other officials seeing Jews as dominating the American government and being conspirators with the Anglo- American powers to control the world. The government also took measures to ban the spread of Anglo-American culture and lifestyle among Chinese people in its territory and promoted traditional Confucian culture. Generally it considered Eastern spiritual culture to be superior to the Western culture of materialism, individualism, and liberalism. Christian missionary schools and missionary activities were banned, the study of English language in schools was reduced, and the usage of English in the postal and customs system was gradually reduced as well. Vice minister of education Tai Yingfu called for a campaign against the Anglo-American nations in education. Zhou Huaren, vice minister of propaganda, blamed Chinese students that studied in the West for spreading Western values among the population and disparaging traditional Chinese culture. Wang Jingwei blamed communism, anarchism, and internationalism (which Wang considered Anglo-American thinking) for making other peoples despise their own culture and embracing the Anglo-American culture. He believed it was necessary to promote Confucianism to oppose Anglo- American \\"cultural aggression.\\" At the same time, Zhou Huaren and others also thought that it was necessary to adopt Western scientific advancements while combining them with traditional Eastern culture to develop themselves, as he said Japan did in the Meiji Restoration, seeing that as a model for others to follow. = National defense = President Wang Jingwei at a military parade on the occasion of the third anniversary of the establishment of the government Type 94 tankettes on parade (note the driver's Stahlhelm and the KMT blue and white sun emblem on the tanks) During its existence, the Reorganized National Government nominally led a large army that was estimated to have included 300,000 to 500,000 men, along with a smaller navy and air force. Although its land forces possessed limited armor and artillery, they were primarily an infantry force. Military aid from Japan was also very limited despite Japanese promises to assist the Nanjing regime in the \\"Japan‚ÄìChina Military Affairs Agreement\\" that they signed. All military matters were the responsibility of the Central Military Commission, but in practice that body was mainly a ceremonial one. In reality, many of the army's commanders operated outside of the direct command of the central government in Nanjing. The majority of its officers were either former National Revolutionary Army personnel or warlord officers from the early Republican era. Thus their reliability and combat capability was questionable, and Wang Jingwei was estimated to only be able to count on the loyalty of about 10% to 15% of his nominal forces. Among the reorganized government's best units were three Capital Guards divisions based in Nanjing, Zhou Fohai's Taxation Police Corps, and the 1st Front Army of Ren Yuandao.Barret (2002), pp. 109‚Äì111Jowett (2004), pp. 65‚Äì67 The majority of the government's forces were armed with a mix of captured Nationalist weaponry and a small amount of Japanese equipment, the latter mainly being given to Nanjing's best units. The lack of local military industry for the duration of the war meant that the Nanjing regime had trouble arming its troops. While the army was mainly an infantry force, in 1941 it did receive 18 Type 94 tankettes for a token armored force, and reportedly they also received 20 armored cars and 24 motorcycles. The main type of artillery in use were medium mortars, but they also possessed 31 field guns (which included Model 1917 mountain guns)‚Äîmainly used by the Guards divisions. Oftentimes, the troops were equipped with the German Stahlhelm, which were used in large quantities by the Chinese Nationalist Army. For small arms, there was no standard rifle and a large variety of different weapons were used, which made supplying them with ammunition difficult. The most common rifles in use was the Chinese version of the Mauser 98k and the Hanyang 88, while other notable weapons included Chinese copies of the Czechoslovakian ZB-26 machine guns.Jowett (2004), pp. 75‚Äì77 Along with the great variation in equipment, there was also a disparity in sizes of units. Some \\"armies\\" had only a few thousand troops while some \\"divisions\\" several thousand. There as a standard divisional structure, but only the elite Guards divisions closer to the capital actually had anything resembling it. In addition to these regular army forces, there were multiple police and local militia, which numbered in the tens of thousands, but were deemed to be completely unreliable by the Japanese.Jowett (2004), pp. 71‚Äì72 Most of the units located around Beijing in northern China remained, in effect, under the authority of the North China Political Council rather than that of the central government. In an attempt to improve the quality of the officer corps, multiple military academies had been opened, including a Central Military Academy in Nanjing and a Naval Academy in Shanghai. In addition there was a military academy in Beijing for the North China Political Council's forces, and a branch of the central academy in Canton.Jowett (2004), pp. 77‚Äì78 A small navy was established with naval bases at Weihaiwei and Qingdao, but it mostly consisted of small patrol boats that were used for coastal and river defense. Reportedly, the captured Nationalist cruisers Ning Hai and Ping Hai were handed over to the government by the Japanese, becoming important propaganda tools. However, the Imperial Japanese Navy took them back in 1943 for its own use. In addition there were two regiments of marines, one at Canton and the other at Weihaiwei. By 1944, the navy was under direct command of Ren Yuandao, the naval minister.Jowett (2004), pp. 103‚Äì104 An Air Force of the Reorganized National Government was established in May 1941 with the opening of the Aviation School and receiving three aircraft, Tachikawa Ki-9 trainers. In the future the air force received additional Ki-9 and Ki-55 trainers as well as multiple transports. Plans by Wang Jingwei to form a fighter squadron with Nakajima Ki-27s did not come to fruition as the Japanese did not trust the pilots enough to give them combat aircraft. Morale was low and a number of defections took place. The only two offensive aircraft they did possess were Tupolev SB bombers which were flown by defecting Nationalist crews.Jowett (2004), pp. 94‚Äì96 The Reorganized National Government's army was primarily tasked with garrison and police duties in the occupied territories. It also took part in anti-partisan operations against Communist guerrillas, such as in the Hundred Regiments Offensive, or played supporting roles for the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA).Jowett (2004), pp. 80‚Äì82 The Nanjing Government undertook a \\"rural pacification\\" campaign to eradicate communists from the countryside, arresting and executing many people suspected of being communists, with support from the Japanese. = Japanese methods of recruiting = During the conflicts in central China, the Japanese utilized several methods to recruit Chinese volunteers. Japanese sympathisers including Nanjing's pro-Japanese governor, or major local landowners such as Ni Daolang, were used to recruit local peasants in return for money or food. The Japanese recruited 5,000 volunteers in the Anhui area for the Reorganized National Government Army. Japanese forces and the Reorganized National Government used slogans like \\"Lay down your guns and take up the plough\\", \\"Oppose the Communist Bandits\\" or \\"Oppose Corrupt Government and Support the Reformed Government\\" to dissuade guerrilla attacks and buttress its support. The Japanese used various methods for subjugating the local populace. Initially, fear was used to maintain order, but this approach was altered following appraisals by Japanese military ideologists. In 1939, the Japanese army attempted some populist policies, including: *land reform by dividing the property of major landowners into small holdings, and allocating them to local peasants; *providing the Chinese with medical services, including vaccination against cholera, typhus, and varicella, and treatments for other diseases; *ordering Japanese soldiers not to violate women or laws; *dropping leaflets from aeroplanes, offering rewards for information (with parlays set up by use of a white surrender flag), the handing over of weapons or other actions beneficial to the Japanese cause. Money and food were often incentives used; and *dispersal of candy, food and toys to children Buddhist leaders inside the occupied Chinese territories (\\"Shao-Kung\\") were also forced to give public speeches and persuade people of the virtues of a Chinese alliance with Japan, including advocating the breaking-off of all relations with Western powers and ideas. In 1938, a manifesto was launched in Shanghai, reminding the populace the Japanese alliance's track-record in maintaining \\"moral supremacy\\" as compared to the often fractious nature of the previous Republican control, and also accusing Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek of treason for maintaining the Western alliance. In support of such efforts, in 1941 Wang Jingwei proposed the Qingxiang Plan to be applied along the lower course of the Yangtze River. A Qingxiang Plan Committee (Qingxiang Weiyuan-hui) was formed with himself as Chairman, and Zhou Fohai and Chen Gongbo (as first and second vice-chairmen respectively). Li Shiqun was made the committee's secretary. Beginning in July 1941, Wang maintained that any areas to which the plan was applied would convert into \\"model areas of peace, anti-communism, and rebuilders of the country\\" (heping fangong jianguo mofanqu). It was not a success.  Economy  The North China Transportation Company and the Central China Railway were established by the former Provisional Government and Reformed Government, which had nationalised private railway and bus companies that operated in their territories, and continued to function providing railway and bus services in the Nanjing regime's territory.  Life under the regime  Japanese under the regime had greater access to coveted wartime luxuries, and the Japanese enjoyed things like matches, rice, tea, coffee, cigars, foods, and alcoholic drinks, all of which were scarce in Japan proper, but consumer goods became more scarce after Japan entered World War II. In Japanese-occupied Chinese territories the prices of basic necessities rose substantially as Japan's war effort expanded. In Shanghai in 1941, they increased elevenfold. Daily life was often difficult in the Nanjing Nationalist Government-controlled Republic of China, and grew increasingly so as the war turned against Japan (c. 1943). Local residents resorted to the black market in order to obtain needed items or to influence the ruling establishment. The Kempeitai (Japanese Military Police Corps), Tokubetsu K≈çt≈ç Keisatsu (Special Higher Police), collaborationist Chinese police, and Chinese citizens in the service of the Japanese all worked to censor information, monitor any opposition, and torture enemies and dissenters. A \\"native\\" secret agency, the Tewu, was created with the aid of Japanese Army \\"advisors\\". The Japanese also established prisoner-of-war detention centres, concentration camps, and kamikaze training centres to indoctrinate pilots. Since Wang's government held authority only over territories under Japanese military occupation, there was a limited amount that officials loyal to Wang could do to ease the suffering of Chinese under Japanese occupation. Wang himself became a focal point of anti-Japanese resistance. He was demonised and branded as an \\"arch-traitor\\" in both KMT and Communist rhetoric. Wang and his government were deeply unpopular with the Chinese populace, who regarded them as traitors to both the Chinese state and Han Chinese identity.Frederic Wakeman, Jr. ‚ÄúHanjian (Traitor) Collaboration and Retribution in Wartime Shanghai.‚Äù In Wen-hsin Yeh, ed. Becoming Chinese: Passages to Modernity and Beyond. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000), 322. Wang's rule was constantly undermined by resistance and sabotage. The strategy of the local education system was to create a workforce suited for employment in factories and mines, and for manual labor. The Japanese also attempted to introduce their culture and dress to the Chinese. Complaints and agitation called for more meaningful Chinese educational development.

Instead he, alongside his vice president Chen Gongbo (who was tried and sentenced to death by the victorious Nationalists), was given the title Hanjian meaning arch- traitor to the Han people. In the following decades, Wang Jingwei and the entire reputation of the collaborationist government have undergone considerable scholastic debate. In general, evaluations produced by scholars working under the People's Republic of China have held the most critical interpretations of the failed regime, Western scholars typically holding the government and Wang Jingwei especially in a sympathetic light, with Taiwanese scholars falling somewhere in the middle. In popular culture Lust, Caution is a 1979 novella by Chinese author Eileen Chang which was later turned into an award-winning film by Ang Lee. The story is about a group of young university students who attempt to assassinate the Minister of Security of the Reorganized National Government. During the war, Ms. Chang was married to Hu Lancheng, a writer who worked for the Reorganized National Government and the story is believed to be largely based on actual events. * The 2009 Chinese film The Message is a thriller/mystery in the vein of a number of Agatha Christie novels. The main characters are all codebreakers serving in the Reorganized National Government's military, but one of them is a Kuomintang double-agent. A Japanese intelligence officer detains the group in a castle and attempts to uncover which of them is the spy using psychological and physical coercion, uncovering the protagonists' bitter rivalries, jealousies, and secrets as he does so.

Jurong West shares boundaries with Tengah in the north, Jurong East in the east, Boon Lay and Pioneer in the south, and Western Water Catchment in the west. Originally a forested area, Jurong West is undergoing rapid development under the ambition of the Housing and Development Board (HDB) to transform it into a fully mature housing estate. History Jurong West originated from the area once called Peng Kang, named after the gambier plantations along Sungei Jurong. By the mid-20th century, the area was home to several brickworks, palm oil plantations and nurseries. At that time, the only public housing estates in Jurong West were Boon Lay and Taman Jurong. Jurong West was largely left alone until 1984, when the HDB began conceptualisation for a new town in Jurong West. Jurong West was carved into nine subzones that would house a total of 94,000 public and private housing units in the long term. The town's first apartment blocks (known locally as flats) were completed at Taman Jurong in 1963. By November 2004, about 71,522 dwelling units were completed. As of 31 March 2018, there are 74,301 HDB dwelling units in Jurong West. Geography Jurong West is a primarily residential town situated west of Tengah New Town in the western part of Singapore, under the West Region as defined by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA). The town is bordered to the north by the Pan Island Expressway (PIE), to the east by Sungei Jurong (Jurong River) and Jurong Lake, to the south by the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE), and to the west by Benoi Road and Upper Jurong Road. Jurong West Town Centre is located in Jurong West Central. An industrial area, part of the Jurong Industrial Estate, is located south of Boon Lay Way and Upper Jurong Road. Another industrial area is currently under development in Wenya as part of the Jurong Innovation District. =Subzones= Jurong West New Town is divided into the following nine subzones. * Boon Lay * Chin Bee * Hong Kah * Jurong West Central * Kian Teck * Safti * Taman Jurong * Wenya * Yunnan A landed housing estate in Yunnan, with Wenya in the foreground. =Demographics= As of 2018, Jurong West has a population of 266,720, most of whom are part of the working population. The most populous subzone is Yunnan with 68,840 residents, closely followed by Jurong West Central with 65,720 residents. Chin Bee, however, has just ten residents, while Safti is completely unpopulated. Packed into an area of , of which just are designated as residential areas, Jurong West has a population density of 27,000 people per km2 (70,000 per mi2). Notable places The Jurong Central Park provides a recreation space for people working in the industrial developments along Jalan Boon Lay. Jurong West's two main rivers, Sungei Jurong and Sungei Lanchar, run through the town with a network of green connectors along their banks. They link housing precincts to neighborhood parks such as Jurong Central Park, as well as the Jurong West Sports Centre, Jurong West Stadium and Frontier Community Centre. These park connectors are linked to the Chinese Garden in Jurong East New Town and the Bukit Batok Town Park in the north, to better serve the recreational needs of the residents of Jurong West. Jurong Central Park, located in Kian Teck, is a rectangular green space created behind Boon Lay MRT station. Jurong West's major public transport amenities were built in tandem with the main public housing development. The elevated track infrastructure of the East West MRT line was developed as the existing public housing blocks were being built in the 1980s. The amenities were built in a contiguous building complex, which gives commuters direct access between Boon Lay MRT station, Boon Lay Bus Interchange, The Centris condominium and Jurong Point shopping centre. Transportation City planners plan for public transport to eventually become the preferred mode of transport. The government of Singapore uses public transport to reduce pollution caused by heavy road traffic. Jurong West is part of the Urban Redevelopment Authority's focus for realising this urban planning model. As Jurong West is relatively distant from the city centre at the Central Area, an efficient, high-volume and high-speed public transport system is also preferred to using road networks, as the government is aiming to reduce the number of cars on the road. =Public transport= East West line Jurong West Town is linked to the rest of Singapore through the East West Line (EWL) at Boon Lay MRT Station, located at the Town Centre. The EWL is a heavy rail mass rapid transit system, and connects to other systems in the MRT network. It is operated by SMRT. There are three Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations that serve Jurong West Planning Area, which are Lakeside, Boon Lay and Pioneer. =Boon Lay MRT station= The Boon Lay MRT Station is located next to Boon Lay Bus Interchange for commuters' ease of switching across different modes of public transport. The MRT station began operations on 6 July 1990, as the western terminus of the East West Line, before additional stations were added further west of the line at Pioneer and Joo Koon on 28 February 2009. =Lakeside MRT station= Lakeside (EW26), another station along the EWL in Jurong West Town, serves the housing developments in Taman Jurong, Hong Kah and Boon Lay. The station began operations on 5 November 1988. =Pioneer MRT station= Pioneer (EW28) is the newest EWL station to open in Jurong West, on 28 February 2009. The station improves accessibility to residential areas of Nanyang and Pioneer, as well as the industrial areas located south of the station. Jurong Region line The inter-town Jurong Region Line (JRL) system is a 24 km mass rapid transit line that will connect residents to the town centre, as well as other areas such as Tengah, Choa Chu Kang and Jurong East. The MRT line will have 24 stations and all will be elevated. The line will open in 2026. Boon Lay Bus Interchange The Boon Lay Bus Interchange was originally opened in July 1990 along with Boon Lay MRT station. At that time, developments around the area in Jurong West New Town were still actively in progress. It was later rebuilt and reopened in December 2009 at the ground level of Jurong Point Shopping Centre, next to Centris condominium, and is the fourth air- conditioned bus interchange in Singapore, after Toa Payoh Bus Interchange, Sengkang Bus Interchange and Ang Mo Kio Bus Interchange. =Road network= Jurong West is connected to many parts of Singapore through its road network. The Pan Island Expressway (PIE) and Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) link Jurong West Town up with Singapore's expressway network. Major roads that run within the boundaries of Jurong West Planning Area include Corporation Road, Boon Lay Way, Jalan Boon Lay, Jalan Bahar, Upper Jurong Road, Pioneer Road North, Jurong West Avenue 4 and Jurong West Avenue 2. Jurong West Town Centre There are four major building complexes within the Jurong West Town Centre. =Jurong Point Shopping Centre= Jurong Point Shopping Centre is Singapore's largest suburban shopping centre. The shopping centre started operations in December 1995 and expanded twice in 1999 and 2008. =The Centris= The Centris is a private condominium that is located above Jurong Point Shopping Centre. =Jurong West Community Building= The Jurong West Community Building is an integrated development comprising the Jurong West Public Library, The Frontier Community Club and Jurong Medical Centre. It is located behind Jurong Point Shopping Centre. =Boon Lay Interchange= Boon Lay Interchange, located in the centre of the town, consists of the Boon Lay Bus Interchange and Boon Lay MRT Station. Amenities =Education= There are 12 primary schools, 11 secondary schools and 2 international schools in Jurong West New Town. Westwood Primary School is one of the 12 primary schools in Jurong West. =Fire stations= Jurong Fire Station, which opened on 17 November 2017, is the first fire station in Singapore to have a slide. The fire station covers 4,000 square metres, and is used by the Singapore Civil Defence Force. =Medical facilities= Pioneer Polyclinic is located next to Jurong West Primary School, along Jurong West Street 61. Pioneer Polyclinic is a government healthcare institution serving the local community in Jurong West. The polyclinic was opened in January 2018. Also located in Jurong West is the Jurong Medical Centre, which complements the acute and step-down care services of Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Jurong Community Hospital. = Sports facilities= Jurong West Sports Centre, formerly known as Jurong West Sports and Recreation Centre, is the largest sports centre in Singapore, and offers one of the two sheltered pools managed by Sport Singapore. Politics Currently, Jurong West is represented in the Parliament of Singapore by six members of parliament (MPs): one MP from Choa Chu Kang GRC, one MP from Hong Kah North SMC, two MPs from Jurong GRC, one MP from Pioneer SMC, and one MP from West Coast GRC. With effect from the 2020 General Election, Jurong West will be represented in the Parliament of Singapore by five members of parliament (MPs): three MPs from Jurong GRC, one MP from Pioneer SMC, and three MPs from West Coast GRC.

It is on the Bletchley ‚Äî Bedford Marston Vale Line, about 2 miles (3.25 km) east of Bletchley. The station is served by London Northwestern Railway local services from Bletchley to Bedford. Services are operated using Class 230/1 multiple units. This station is one of the six stations serving the Milton Keynes urban area. History The London and North Western Railway opened Bow Brickhill station in 1905, significantly later than many other stations on the branch. It was one of seven halts built for the introduction of a steam rail motor service over the line.\\"Disused Stations - Bow Brickhill\\"Disused Stations Site Record; Retrieved 7 September 2016 It closed temporarily during the first World War as an economy measure, from Jan 1917 to May 1919. Bow Brickhill lost its staffing and gated level crossing to modernisation in the 1980s, and since then the station has been unmanned except for two security cameras operated from other stations. Until 2004 Bow Brickhill was unique on the line for having staggered platforms. The purpose of this is so that road traffic on the level crossing is not held up by trains standing still in the platform. However recently a number of other stations on the line including Aspley Guise have been rebuilt to have their platforms staggered also as part of the Bedford-Bletchley route modernisation. Bow Brickhill in 1962 Another oddity about Bow Brickill is that the road crossing here, the V10 Brickhill Street, has a roundabout immediately on either side of the crossing. This causes traffic jams whenever the crossing barriers are down, as each roundabout clogs with the traffic queue and remains so for up to ten minutes. Milton Keynes Council has a long-term plan for the level crossing to be replaced with a bridge, but the Transport and Works Act Order for East West Rail exempts Network Rail from any obligation to provide such a bridge as part of its works on revitalising this line.

It is connected to mainland Nova Scotia by a short causeway. History The island was home to Acadian families until the expulsion of April 1756. From the 1960s to the late 1980s it was home to families of Royal Canadian Air Force and later Canadian Forces personnel stationed at CFS Barrington, a Pinetree Line early warning radar station located 27 km away at Baccaro. Families of service personnel were housed in 60 ft by 12 ft mobile trailers, except for the base Commanding Officer, who had a larger house at the end of the causeway. At its peak, the military housing on Sherose Island contained in excess of 100 families. The military housing was reduced throughout the 1970s and 1980s as CFS Barrington went into a decline, leaving the concrete pads on which they sat. One can still find concrete pads all over the island where the trailers were once placed. Remains of Acadian cellars may also be seen.

Many aspects of the game, such as a communal \\"downtown\\" area, were incorporated into the third expansion pack for The Sims: Hot Date.

Examples of computer rage include cursing or yelling at a computer, slamming or throwing keyboards and mice, and assaulting the computer or monitor with an object or weapon.  Notable cases  In April 2015, a Colorado man was cited for firing a gun within a residential area when he took his computer into a back alley and shot it eight times with a 9mm pistol. When questioned, he told police that he had become so frustrated with his computer that he had \\"reached critical mass,\\" and stated that after he had shot his computer, \\"the angels sung on high.\\" In 2007, a German man threw his computer out the window in the middle of the night, startling his neighbors. German police were sympathetic and did not press charges, stating \\"Who hasn't felt like doing that?\\" In 2006, the staged surveillance video \\"Bad Day\\", showing a man assaulting his computer at work, became a viral hit on the Internet, reaching over two million views. Other instances of reported computer rage have ranged from a restaurant owner who threw his laptop into a deep fryer, to an individual who threw his computer out the window, but forgot that the window was closed.  Prevalence  In 1999, it was speculated that computer rage had become more common than road rage in traffic, but in a 2015 study, it was found that reported rates of anger when using a computer were lower than reported rates of anger while driving. However, reports of anger while driving or using computers were found to be far more common than anger in other situations. In a 2013 survey of American adults, 36% of respondents who reported experiencing computer issues, also reported that they had screamed, yelled, cursed, or physically assaulted their computers within the last six months. In 2009, a survey was conducted with British computer users about their experiences with computers. This survey found that 54% of respondents reported verbally abusing their computers, and 40% reported that they had become physically violent toward their computers. The survey also found that most users experienced computer rage three to four times a month. Differences in types of computer rage have also been found between different geographical regions. For example, one survey found that individuals from London have been found to be five times more likely to physically assault their computers, while those from Yorkshire and Humberside were found to be more likely to yell at their computers. Differences have also been observed for age groups, as younger adults (18‚Äì24 years old) have reported more abusive behaviors in the face of computer frustration when compared to older adults (over 35 years old). Individuals with less computer experience in particular have also been reported to experience increased feelings of anger and helplessness when it comes to computers, but other research has argued that it is the self-efficacy beliefs about computers that are predictive of computer frustration, not the amount of computer experience or use. In 1999 Professor Robert J. Edelmann, a Chartered Clinical, Forensic and Health Psychologist and a Fellow of the British Psychological Society, was offering a special helpline in the UK for those suffering from technology related anger.  Causes  = Computer factors = Users can experience computer anger and frustration for a number of reasons. American adults surveyed in 2013 reported that almost half (46%) of their computer problems were due to malware or computer viruses, followed by software issues (10%) and not enough memory (8%). In another survey, users reported email, word processors, web browsing, operating system crashes, inability to locate features, and program crashes as frequent initiators of computer frustration. These technical issues, paired with tight timelines, poor work progress, and failure to complete a computer task can create heightened computer anger and frustration. When this anger and frustration exceeds a person's control, it can turn into rage. = Psychological factors = Research on emotion has shown that anger is often caused by interruptions of plans and expectations, especially through the violation of social norms. This sense of anger can be magnified when the individual does not understand why they are unable to meet their goal or task at hand or why there was a violation of social norms. Psychologists have argued that this is particularly relevant to computer rage, as computer users interact with computers in a similar manner that they interact with other people (for more information, see The Media Equation). Thus, when computers fail to function in the face of incoming deadlines or an important task to accomplish, users can feel betrayed by the computer in the same way they can feel betrayed by other people. Specifically, when users fail to understand why their computer will not work properly, often in the times they need it to the most, it can invoke a sense of hostility as it is interpreted as a breach of social norms or a personal attack. Consistent with this finding, perceived betrayal by the computer can also elicit other negative emotions. One survey of US adults reported that 10% of users who experience computer issues experienced feeling helplessness, and 4% reported feeling victimized. In the same survey, 7% adults ages 18‚Äì34 reported that they had cried over their computer problems within the previous six months.  Dangers and potential benefits  Computer rage can result in damaged property or physical injuries, as well as psychological harm. Some experts have suggested that venting frustrations on the computer may have some benefits, but other experts disagree. For example, yelling at the computer has been suggested as a way to moderate one's anger to avoid the ill effects of anger suppression, but new research has suggested that yelling can negatively affect health in itself. Alternatively, releasing anger on a computer has been viewed as advantageous as it directs this rage at an object as opposed to another person, and can make individuals feel better afterwards.  Prevention and management  In response to computer issues that invoke frustration, some experts have suggested walking away from the computer for 15 minutes to \\"cool off\\". Other methods to prevent computer rage can be backing up computer data often, increasing memory of the computer, and even imagining pleasant images, such as petting an animal. Adopting a goal of improving computer knowledge may also be beneficial, as users are less likely to report computer rage when they view the issue as a challenge and not as a setback. If computer rage cannot be avoided, guidelines on how to rage with minimal consequences, such as wearing safety goggles and taking frustration out on older equipment, can be followed to reduce the likelihood of injury and significant property loss. Employers of staff who work with computers, often in situations where time is crucial, can take steps to prevent computer rage, such as making sure there is adequate software, and providing employees with anger management strategies. Some computer technician companies have reported that, to reduce computer rage, their technicians are trained on how to work with customers in sensitive psychological states just as much as how to diagnose and fix technical issues. Designing computer interfaces to display more emotional support when errors occur, or provide therapy strategies, has also been suggested as a way to mitigate computer anger and rage. The application of affective computing has been shown to effectively mitigate negative emotions connected to computer use. One study found that an interface that sought the user's feelings, provided empathy, and validated reported emotional states significantly reduced negative emotions associated with computer frustration for users. Another study found that when error messages contain positive wording (\\"Great that the computer will soon work again\\") compared to negative wording (\\"This is frustrating\\") or a neutral error message, users exhibited more signs of happiness.

It is unstaffed and is operated by London Northwestern Railway. St Johns was Bedford's first station, on the Oxford to Cambridge line. Its role diminished following the closure of that line, leaving it with a truncated route to Bletchley. British Rail closed the original station on 14 May 1984 and diverted services from Bletchley along a new chord line to Bedford Midland station when a new bay platform was opened. Services The station is served by London Northwestern Railway local services from Bletchley to Bedford via the Marston Vale Line, using Class 230/1 multiple units. Monday to Saturdays, there is generally an hourly service to Bletchley (westbound) and to Bedford Midland (eastbound) with no Sunday service. Community Rail Partnership In common with others on the Marston Vale Line, the station is covered by the Marston Vale Community Rail Partnership,Marston Vale Community Rail Partnership which aims to increase use of the line by involving local people. History =Opening= The station was opened in November 1846 by the Bedford Railway as the eastern terminus of its line from Bletchley, the first line to reach the town. The station was on the west side of the A600 London Road (), with the main station buildings on the south side of the line facing the public house. The goods yard was further west nearer the River Great Ouse to receive river traffic. A second connecting line to the goods yard created a triangle which diverted drainage to produce a pond which supplied the station and small two-road locomotive shed. =1875 Accident= Signalling diagram from the former Bedford No1 signal box (L&NWR;) A second station was opened in Bedford in 1857 on the Midland Railway's to line. The route chosen by the Midland took it across the earlier line at a point near the Bletchley end of the triangle, and a level crossing was built. In March 1875, a Midland passenger train collided with the rear coaches of a Bedford service, killing one passenger and injuring four others. The subsequent enquiry identified a badly-positioned Bedford starter signal as a major cause of the accident. To remedy the problem a 29-lever signal box was opened in 1877 to control new interlocked signals, and block signalling was introduced throughout the Bedford line, which had been extended to Cambridge. =Decline and relocation= Original station in June 1962 An Oxford-bound train in October 1967, shortly before withdrawal of this service The site of the original station in 2018 Although the Second World War saw the Oxford- Cambridge line handle unprecedented levels of traffic, it suffered from a lack of investment in the post-war years. The 1955 Modernisation Plan proposed improvements to the line, believing it could be a strategic cross-country route for freight across three British Railways regions without having to pass through London. The policy was however to change within a few years, leaving the Bletchley Flyover as a testament of the change of course. The first attempt to close the line came in 1959, but was unsuccessful in the face of local opposition. Hopes for the line thereafter rose when it did not figure in the Beeching Report, but it was nevertheless proposed for closure in 1964, with the Oxford ‚Äî Bletchley and Bedford ‚Äî Cambridge routes closing after the last day of service on 30 December 1967. The Bletchley - Bedford route, now known as the Marston Vale Line, survived in a downgraded form as freight facilities were withdrawn and the stations became unstaffed halts. The station, now a terminus, came under the authority of then area manager at Bedford Midland. By March 1971 the main station buildings and water tower had been demolished, leaving it as a terminus halt. A third attempt to close the line in 1972 was resisted by the Bedford Rail Users' Association. In 1984, a replacement station was opened in the former freight yard, at the north end of the triangle, which enabled services to continue to Bedford Midland. The new connection runs over the route of the Midland's Hitchin line, which closed in 1964. The old station site was abandoned, although some of the furniture, such as the lampposts, was not removed. The site has now been reclaimed by nature. =Future= The East West Rail Consortium is seeking to reinstate the entire Oxford ‚Äî Cambridge route, which might include rebuilding the station on its original site, which remains undeveloped.

He was bishop of Dorylaeum (or Dorylaion) which is located in Phrygia (now Turkey). The name Eusebius may also be found as Eusebios which means ‚Äúpious‚Äù in Greek. The surname ‚Äúof Dorylaeum‚Äù is a result of his appointment to bishop in Dorylaeum. Early life Eusebius is unknown before his oppositions to Nestorius and Anasthasius in the mid-420s. He is described as being a lawyer or other non-clergy (a layman) involved with the law or court in Constantinople. In some references, he is described as a rhetor. Opposition to Nestorius and Anastasius In the late 420s the newly appointed patriarch of Constantinople, Nestorius, and a presbyter named Anasthasius (both from Antioch) had been preaching on the Greek word theot√≥kos (‚Äúmother of God‚Äù) as it is used referring to Mary, mother of Jesus; they were imploring the people that Mary should not be worshiped or referred to as such. Instead, they explained that she should be called christot√≥kos (‚Äúmother of Christ‚Äù): a symptom of his larger belief that Christ was born a man, and God was dwelling inside or upon him. This quickly drew attention from church officials who disapproved of such a change in terminology regarding Mary, as well as the Christian public. During one sermon by Nestorius on this topic in AD 428 or 429, Eusebius publicly proclaimed that ‚Äúthe eternal Word had submitted to be born a second time,‚Äù getting his fellow listeners at the sermon to drown out Nestorius with sympathetic applause. Soon afterwards, a letter was posted in Constantinople that correlated Nestorius‚Äô teachings with that of Paul of Samosata, an heretical figure from the previous century that had also denied or otherwise challenged the divine nature in Christ. This letter was called the Contestatio and is generally attributed to Eusebius of Dorylaeum. Eusebius may have become a priest soon after this incident. First Council of Ephesus (431) Soon after Nestorius‚Äô public opposition from Eusebius came the summoning of a council in Ephesus to settle the problem of his teachings, where Nestorius was ultimately deposed. At this time a presbyter in Constantinople named Eutyches was in alliance with Eusebius of Dorylaeum in opposition to Nestorius, but it is unclear whether either played a major role in the proceedings of the council beyond accusation, which was largely directed by Cyril of Alexandria. Nonetheless, Eusebius must have gained some credit for his Contestatio and outspoken opposition to Nestorius, because at some point between 431 and 448 he was made bishop of Dorylaeum. Accusation of Eutyches By 448 Eutyches had set himself up for a confrontation with orthodoxy by espousing views that Christ was made of heavenly flesh and therefore not fully human, or otherwise denying the full humanity of Christ. These views, though opposite of those of Nestorius, were just as unorthodox. The growing animosity between Eutyches and other clergy led to a synod being called by the archbishop Flavian (who had replaced Proclus in 446), and who happened to be out of favor with both Chrysaphius, a powerful minister and godson of Eutyches, and the emperor Theodosius II. This synod, called the Council of Constantinople or sometimes referred to as the ‚Äúhome synod,‚Äù was presided over by Flavian in Constantinople. At the synod Eusebius of Dorylaeum presented Flavian with a letter, detailing his complaints against Eutyches, as well as making known his willingness to be a witness against him personally. Eusebius relates that he had warned Eutyches several times in private, but he had gone unheeded. Flavian urged that Eutyches should be called to the synod to defend himself, but Eutyches refused to come as he had vowed to remain in his monastery ‚Äúas though it were a tomb.‚Äù Eusebius pressed his accusation, saying that there were enough witnesses at the synod to confirm his accusations and condemn Eutyches, but Flavian repeatedly sent for Eutyches to come and ask forgiveness. Flavian remarked of Eusebius after one particular session: \\"You know the zeal of the accuser, fire itself seems cool to him in comparison with pure zeal for religion. God knows! I besought him to desist and yield; as, however, he persisted, what could I do?‚Äù When Eutyches finally stood before the council, he refused to revoke his teachings and was deposed as a heretic. Latrocinium or ‚ÄúRobber Council‚Äù (449) The year after Eutyches was condemned in Constantinople by Flavian, a council was called by Theodosius II. This council was prompted by an appeal to Theodosius, through Chrysaphius, by Eutyches himself to clear his name, restore his title, and punish his accusers. It would become known as the Latrocinium (‚ÄúRobber Council‚Äù) because of Pope Leo I‚Äôs letter to Pulcheria about events that transpired there. The patriarch of Alexandria, Dioscorus, was appointed to preside over the council, which was held in Ephesus. Flavian was the primary defendant at the council, as he was seen as the one who had deposed Eutyches, but Eusebius of Dorylaeum was also called. During the council Dioscorous dominated the proceedings, not allowing a lengthy letter from Pope Leo I (now known as the Tome of Leo) to be read regarding the nature of Christ, nor allowing Eusebius to speak in his defense. He forced bishops under threat of violence to adopt the council‚Äôs proceedings and depose Flavian and Eusebius, which they did. Flavian was beaten or somehow injured in the ensuing riot so that he died a short time later, but Eusebius found sanctuary with Pope Leo I through a letter of appeal. Council of Chalcedon (451) The events of 449 were opposed by many, not the least of which was Pulcheria, sister to emperor Theodosius II. When the emperor died, Marcian succeeded him and called the Council of Chalcedon in 451 to resolve the injustices done at the Robber Council. Dioscorous was deposed, Eutyches was condemned a second time, and Eusebius of Dorylaeum was reinstated as bishop; Flavian‚Äôs name was also cleared in the annulment of the decisions made at the Latrocinium. Eusebius brought a petition against Dioscorous and is recorded as speaking at the council: ‚Äú‚Ä¶I have been wronged by Dioscorous; the faith has been wronged; Bishop Flavian was murdered. He together with me was unjustly deposed by Dioscorous.‚Äù The most important outcome of the struggle was a statement of belief known as the Chalcedonian Definition of the faith, which Eusebius of Dorylaeum helped to draft, though his exact significance in that capacity is uncertain. After the Council of Chalcedon nothing further is known about Eusebius of Dorylaeum. BibliographyFlavian, Eusebius, and T.A.

Archduke of Austria-Este Arms as borne by Archduke Robert during his lifetime. On 16 April 1917, at the age of two, his father the Emperor ceded the title of Archduke of Austria-Este in Robert's favor. Archduke Robert was thereby chosen to preserve, in the form of a distinct secundogeniture, the Habsburg-Lorraine representation of the once- sovereign Duchy of Modena which had belonged to the House of Este. He was thus made heir to his assassinated relative Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, (1863‚Äì1914), who had inherited in 1875 the Austria-Este designation and what had been salvaged of the Este fortune when the duchy was annexed to Italy in 1860. Archduke Robert descended through his Habsburg father from Ercole III d'Este, Duke of Modena, and his mother Zita was a descendant of Maria Beatrice d'Este, heiress of Modena and her husband, Archduke Ferdinand of Austria. Thus the lineage of the last Este dukes, in female descent, remained joined to the Austria-Este legacy. Archduke Robert eventually adopted use for himself and his descendants in male line the surname Austria-Este, and he took also the title Duke of Este, intended henceforth to be borne by the head of the Austria-Este branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. Upon his death in 1996, the day before his 81st birthday, he was succeeded as head of this line by his son, Lorenz of Austria-Este, Prince of Belgium (born 1955). Although the marriage of his eldest son to Princess Astrid of Belgium, relegated use of the Austria-Este archdukedom to a secondary title in that realm, the title continues in use elsewhere among his cadet descendants. Family Archduke Robert married Princess Margherita of Savoy-Aosta (born 7 April 1930), elder daughter of the late Amadeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta on 28 December 1953 in Bourg- en-Bresse, France (civilly) and 29 December 1953 (religiously), in Brou, France. The couple had five children, all of whom use the designation of Austria-Este: * Archduchess Maria Beatrice (born 11 December 1954), who wed 26 April 1980 in Chartres Count Riprand of Arco-Zinneberg, a great-grandson of the last Bavarian king, Ludwig III and of Maria Theresia, Archduchess of Austria-Este.

He previously served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Dublin Mid-West constituency from 2002 to 2011. He is also a musical performer. Gogarty contested the 2016 general election as part of the Independent Alliance, but was not elected. Political career =Early local politics= Gogarty joined the Green Party in 1989 as a student. He ran unsuccessfully in the 1991 local elections for Fingal County Council. He was first elected at the 1999 local elections for the Lucan local electoral area of South Dublin County Council. =D√°il √âireann= Gogarty previously contested the 1992 and 1997 general elections in the Dublin West constituency. He also ran at the 1996 Dublin West by-election caused by the death of Brian Lenihan Snr. At the 2002 general election, he was elected to the D√°il for the new Dublin Mid-West constituency. He was the first Green Party member to be elected in a three- seat constituency. After his election, Gogarty gave up his local council seat, in line with Green Party policy against dual-mandate and was succeeded by the late Fintan McCarthy. At the 2007 general election, he retained his D√°il seat, taking the second seat in the enlarged constituency. Following the Green Party's entry to government in 2007, Gogarty was appointed Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Science. In 2002, 2003 and again in 2008, Gogarty called for the pay of members of the Oireachtas to be cut. In November 2003, he described the decision to raise TDs pay by 13% during the Celtic Tiger era, compared with 6% for pensioners and social welfare recipients as a \\"urination\\" on the less well off in society. On 3 August 2010, Gogarty wrote to the Clerk of the Seanad asking that newspaper claims alleging that Senator Ivor Callely had supplied phone expenses claims on headed paper belonging to a company which no longer existed be investigated. Gogarty appeared on the RT√â Joe Duffy radio show discussing this issue. He went to Lucan Garda station the next day and requested an investigation. In November 2010, he brought his 18-month-old daughter to a Green Party press conference. The following day, many callers to a radio show criticised his decision. He responded that his regular child minder was not available when the press conference was called. Gogarty's work in protecting educational investment during a period of cutbacks has been widely reported in the media, including a profile in The Irish Times in November 2010, which claimed that his contribution was recognised by admirers and detractors alike. 2009 swearing incident On 11 December 2009, during his contributionhttps://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/2009-12-11/11/?highlight%5B0%5D=deputy&highlight;%5B1%5D=fuck&highlight;%5B2%5D=you&highlight;%5B3%5D=deputy&highlight;%5B4%5D=stagg&highlight;%5B5%5D=fuck&highlight;%5B6%5D=you to a debate in the D√°il on the Social Welfare bill of the 2010 budget, Gogarty said to Labour Party TD Emmet Stagg: \\"With all due respect, in the most unparliamentary language, fuck you Deputy Stagg! Fuck you!\\"  * He immediately apologised to the House for his use of unparliamentary language, which was criticised by Deputy Lucinda Creighton, who demanded his suspension. The incident was referred to a sitting of the D√°il committee on procedure and privileges, when it emerged that \\"fuck\\" is not included among the list of forbidden words set out in the Salient Rulings of the Chair, the document which regulates the behaviour and conduct of TDs. Gogarty later clarified that the outburst was totally unintentional and not premeditated as some had suggested. He also said that the outburst had to be taken in the context of his contribution during the debate that day as well as a very turbulent and heated debate the previous night. Loss of seat and return Gogarty lost his seat at the 2011 general election, polling 3.47% of the poll and losing his right to reclaim election expenses. Gogarty withdrew from politics until 2014 after losing his D√°il seat, and let his membership of the Green Party lapse. In early 2014, he decided to run for South Dublin County Council in local elections that June. He considered returning to the Green Party but ultimately ran a \\"low key campaign\\" as an independent. He was elected on the 11th count to the fourth of eight seats in the Lucan local electoral area. In September 2015, Gogarty announced his intention to contest the 2016 general election as part of the Independent Alliance in the Dublin Mid-West constituency. He failed to be elected, receiving 5.9% FPV (first-preference votes). He served as Mayor of South Dublin County Council from 2017 to 2018. He ran in the 2019 Dublin Mid-West by-election, finishing third with 12.7% FPV. He was also an unsuccessful candidate for Dublin Mid-West at the 2020 general election. Other activities In June 2011, he spent four days filming at the \\"Charity ICA Bootcamp\\" in County Louth. The show was broadcast on RT√â One the following August. He raised ‚Ç¨5,000 for Pieta House, a suicide prevention and awareness charity. From July to November 2011, Gogarty was involved in season 4 of the RT√â television series Celebrity Bainisteoir managing Oughterard's Seamus √ì M√°ille GAA Club, Galway. He was beaten by Tony Cascarino's team. In August 2012, he released his debut single \\"Wishing on a Photograph\\" under the stage name of His Sweet Surprise. His third single \\"Know You All My Life\\" reached number one on the 7Digital Download Chart in January 2013.

These difficulties centre upon the provision of proper sanitation facilities, internal displacement and development of adequate infrastructure. Nonetheless, Uganda is, as per the Relief Web sponsored Humanitarian Profile ‚Äì 2012, making considerable developments in this area. After a heavily contested election campaign, President Yoweri Museveni was re-elected into office and his re-election was independently verified by Amnesty International. Despite verification of the election results, Amnesty did express concerns over alleged election violence and freedom of press restrictions. Conflict in the north Since various rebel groups started fighting the government of President Yoweri Museveni, beginning in August 1986, about 2 million Ugandans have been displaced, An Amnesty International article discusses a 2008 agreement between the government and the LRA to try LRA leaders for their crimes. and tens of thousands have been killed. An estimated 67,000 children have been kidnapped by the LRA for use as child soldiers and slaves since 1987. Signing of a cessation of hostilities agreement in 2006 due to a successful campaign executed by the Uganda Peoples Defence Forces (UPDF) put an end to LRA violence in Uganda. The past conflict in the north of the country between the Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF) and the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) has decimated the economy, retarded the development of affected areas and led to numerous gross human rights violations. These violations centred upon the poor emergency provision provided to Internally Displaced Persons fleeing their homes to avoid LRA. In the twelve years since the signing of hostilities agreement many of those displaced persons have returned to their homes and a rehabilitation and redevelopment programme is underway. It has been acknowledged by both the Ugandan Government and the United Nations that this is a work in progress and that considerable improvements must be made. In this regard a rehabilitation programme has been launched  Persecution of homosexuals  In October 2009, a bill was tabled in the Ugandan Parliament entitled \\"Anti-Homosexuality Bill 2009\\" calling for harsher penalties for homosexuals, up to and including the death penalty.\\"Homosexuals face death penalty\\", 25 October 2009 As originally drafted and tabled this bill also requires that any citizen who suspects another person of being homosexual, is required to report the homosexual to police, or they too may receive a fine or time in prison.\\"Uganda Considers New Anti-Gay Law\\" , 25 October 2009 The proposed bill goes so far as to forbid landlords from renting to a known homosexual, and would ban any public discussion of homosexuality.\\"US slams Uganda's new anti-gay bill\\", 25 October 2009 The international community was greatly opposed to the introduction of this bill and expressed concerns about the fact that it may become law, indeed U.S. President Barack Obama called it 'odious'. As a result of mounting international pressure the bill never proceeded past committee stage. On 7 March 2012 backbench MP David Bahati reintroduced the bill to much controversy. He was however at pains to point out that the provision for death penalty had been decided upon as unnecessary and removed from the bill at committee stage in the 8th parliament. As such, the bill as introduced into the 9th Parliament, had no provision for the death penalty. This bill remains highly criticised and controversial. It has again been met with widespread condemnation. The Ugandan government in replying to this condemnation issued a statement citing the fact that the bill was a private members bill and that it did not have the support of the government. On 24 February 2014 President Yoweri Museveni signed the '\\"Anti Homosexuality Bill\\" into law. The following day the tabloid \\"Red Pepper\\" published a list of 200 allegedly gay men. Following the tightening of the bill several western industrial nations, among others Sweden, the United States and the Netherlands have suspended their aid to Uganda. The World Bank postponed a $90 million loan to Uganda's health system over the law. Abuses by Ugandan security forces :\\"On 14 June [2003] [Violent Crime Crack Unit Green] officers arrested Nsangi Murisidi, aged 29, on suspicion that he had facilitated friends to commit robbery and for alleged possession of a gun. Relatives tried in vain to visit him in detention. On 18 June the lawyer representing the family received confirmation of his death in custody while at the VCCU headquarters at Kireka, a suburb of Kampala. The death certificate established the cause of death as extensive loss of fluid and blood, severe bleeding in the brain and extensive deep burns on the buttocks. The body also bore 14 deep wounds. In October the Minister of Internal Affairs informed AI that an inquiry had been ordered, but no progress was subsequently reported.\\" Political freedom In April 2005, two opposition Member of Parliament were arrested on what are believed to be politically motivated charges. Ronald Reagan Okumu and Michael Nyeko Ocula are from the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC), the movement believed to pose the greatest threat to the reelection of President Yoweri Museveni in 2006. The most prominent opposition to President Museveni, Kizza Besigye has run for office three times and been defeated each time. On the occasion of his last defeat (the 2011 elections) Kizza Besigye called for all his FDC party members to boycott the parliament and not take up their seats as elected. Party members of the FDC refused to do this and Kizza Besigye stood down as party leader. Besigye is a prominent political figure and he has identified several incidents whereby his political freedom was violated. Notably in 2011 Besigye was placed under preventative arrest, however he was immediately released as this arrest was deemed unlawful by the Ugandan Courts. Freedom of the press As in many African countries, government agencies continue to impinge on the LGBT rights in Uganda. In late 2002, the independent Monitor newspaper was temporarily closed by the army and police. Journalists from the paper continued to come under attack in 2004, two of whom were publicly denounced as \\"rebel collaborators\\" by a spokesman for the UPDF.Uganda Country Report. Home Office, United Kingdom. 2005. In February 2004, the Supreme Court ruled the offence of \\"publication of false news\\" to be void and unconstitutional. In 2005, Uganda was rated as the 13th most free press of 48 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa In 2010, Uganda was rated the 15th most free press of 48 countries. On the 24th day of January 2012 Issac Kasamani, a photo journalist alleged in a newspaper report that he had been shot at by a police officer whilst covering an opposition rally. An independent investigation into this incident was immediately ordered and an independent report completed by a foreign national concluded that no live ammunition was fired on the date in question. Upon release of this report Ugandan Minister Hon. James Baba expressed concern over the standards of reporting surrounding the incident and announced his intention to look closely at media regulation. This is of international concern. In November 2012, John Ssegawa, co-director of the critical State of the Nation play reported that Uganda's Media Council had decided to ban further showings. Ssegawa said the theatre production company would continue to stage the production and defy the ban. Child labor According to the U.S. Department of Labor, Uganda has made significant advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor in 2013. However, underage children continue to engage in strenuous activities mostly in the agricultural sector and in commercial sexual exploitation. The Department's report Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor indicates that 30% of children aged 5 to 14 are working children and that 95% of them work in the agricultural sector, picking coffee and tea, growing rice, herding cattle and fishing among other activities. Instances of child labor have also been observed in the mining industry (brick making and charcoal production) and in the services sector. Categorical forms of child labor in Uganda included sexual and military exploitation. In December 2014, the Department issued a List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor where 10 goods were listed under the country of Uganda. These included bricks, cattle, charcoal, coffee, fish, rice, sugarcane, tea and tobacco.

For example, in the development of new compounds for PET (positron emission tomography) scanning, a radioactive isotope is chemically joined with a peptide (subunit of a protein). This particular class of isotopes emits positrons (which are antimatter particles, equal in mass to the electron, but with a positive charge). When ejected from the nucleus, positrons encounter an electron, and undergo annihilation which produces two gamma rays travelling in opposite directions. These gamma rays can be measured, and when compared to a standard, quantified. Biodistribution imaging after dissection For example, a new compound would be injected intravenously into a group of 16-20 rodents (typically mice or rats). At intervals of 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours, smaller groups (4-5) of the animals are euthanized, then dissected. The organs of interest (usually: blood, liver, spleen, kidney, muscle, fat, adrenals, pancreas, brain, bone, stomach, small intestine, and upper and lower large intestine, etc.) are placed in pre-weighed containers, then into a device that measures gamma radiation. The results give a dynamic view of how the compound moves through the animal. A useful compound is one that is used either for the medical imaging of certain body parts or tumors (at low doses of radioactivity) or treating tumors (at high doses of radioactivity). Non-invasive biodistribution imaging in gene therapy In gene therapy, gene delivery vectors, such as viruses, can be imaged according either to their particle biodistribution or their transduction pattern. The former means labeling the viruses with a contrast agent, being visible in some imaging modality, such as MRI or SPECT/PET and latter means visualising the marker gene of gene delivery vector to be visible by the means of immunohistochemical methods, optical imaging or even by PCR. Non-invasive imaging has gained popularity as the imaging equipment has become available for research use from clinics. For example, avidin-displaying baculoviruses could be imaged in rat brain by coating them with biotinylated iron particles, rendering them visible in MR imaging. The biodistribution of the iron-virus particles was seen to concentrate on the choroid plexus cells of lateral ventricles.

From Left to right: Oscar D'Agostino, Emilio Segr√®, Edoardo Amaldi, Franco Rasetti and Enrico Fermi The Via Panisperna boys (Italian: I ragazzi di Via Panisperna) were a group of young scientists led by Enrico Fermi. In Rome in 1934, they made the famous discovery of slow neutrons which later made possible the nuclear reactor, and then the construction of the first atomic bomb. The nickname of the group comes from the address of the Physics Institute, at the University of Rome La Sapienza. The Via Panisperna, a street of Rione Monti in the city center, got its name from a nearby monastery, San Lorenzo in Panisperna. The other members of the group were Edoardo Amaldi, Oscar D'Agostino, Ettore Majorana, Bruno Pontecorvo, Franco Rasetti and Emilio Segr√®. All of them were physicists, except for D'Agostino who was a chemist. The growth of the group The group grew under the supervision of the physicist, minister, senator and director of the Institute of physics Orso Mario Corbino. Corbino recognized the qualities of Enrico Fermi and led the commission who appointed him in 1926 as professor of one of the three first Chairs of Theoretical Physics in Italy. From 1929, Fermi and Corbino dedicated themselves to the transformation of the institute into a modern research centre. Research The first version of their research laboratory was mainly dedicated to atomic and molecular spectroscopy; afterwards they moved towards experimental studies of the atomic nucleus. Research included the bombarding of various substances with neutrons, obtained by irradiating beryllium with alpha particles emitted by radon, which is a strongly radioactive gas that renders possible numerous stable artificial radioactive elements. On the theoretical side, the work of Ettore Majorana and Fermi enabled the understanding of the structure of the atomic nucleus and the forces acting in it, known as the Majorana Forces. In 1933 and 1934 they published the fundamental theory of beta decay. The group disperses In 1938, because of the general climate in Europe, and in particular in Italy the group dispersed and most of its members emigrated. The head of the group, Prof. Fermi, was also forced to emigrate, since the passing of the Fascist racial laws were damaging his wife, who was Jewish, and his academic career. Fermi left fascist Italy with his family for Stockholm to receive the Nobel Prize on 6 December 1938, and from there they reached the U.S. Oscar D'Agostino and Edoardo Amaldi were the only ones who remained in Italy. In the post-war reconstruction of Italian physics, Amaldi contributed significantly to the foundation of CERN. In the media The movie director Gianni Amelio has told their story in a TV-movie which became a film, I ragazzi di via Panisperna (1989). The building in Via Panisperna, lying on the Viminale hill, is today included in the complex of the Ministry of the Interior. The edifice is planned to host a centre for research and a museum of physics named after Enrico Fermi. See also References  Further reading La scienza. Molecole, atomi, particelle. Vol. 12.

It is a scatter band (what some peers might call a \\"scramble band\\"), as distinct from university marching bands that emphasize precise movements and geometric field formations. Band members refer to themselves as \\"The Members Of...\\", which is derived from their introduction at Yale events. About The Band Wearing chef hats Aside from Director Thomas C. Duffy and Business Manager Stephanie Theodos Hubbard, the band is largely student-run. * The Drum Major conducts the band during rehearsals and at games. The current Drum Major is Elizabeth Calabresi, TC ‚Äò21. * The Manager works closely with the Drum Major to organize performances and events on-and-off campus and ensure the well-being of the group. The current Manager is Patrick Cherry, GH ‚Äò21. * The Production Managers (PROs) guide a production team that writes each week's halftime show. The current PROs are Alex Wynn, TD '22, Eleazar Camez, GH '21, and Claire Nelson MC '22. * The Student Arranger (STUD) heads the Musicological Junta, the student team that arranges music for the shows. The current STUD is Matt Tu, MC '2@. * The Social Chairs plan social gatherings and bonding events for the band outside of performances. They work to create a comfortable environment for everyone in the band. The current social chairs are Patrick Cherry, GH '21 and Jacob Payne, TD' 21. * The Equipment Managers ensure that the band has all the necessary items to thrive during rehearsals and performances. The current equipment managers are Lilly Gold, MC '21 and Natalia Taylor, BR '21. * The Media Specialists (Photogs) document the band's adventures through photos and videos. They record every halftime show, which is posted on the band's YouTube channel. They post photos of the band on Facebook and they have control over the band's Twitter. The current Photog is Victoria Winter, BF '22. * There are eight sections, the leaders of which assist the Drum Major and Manager in the running of the band. They also lead sectionals and provide section morale. The current section leaders are Hailey Dykstra (Trumpets), SY ‚Äò23; Ben Christensen (Low Brass), MC ‚Äò23; Xilonem Perez (Straaangs), PM ‚Äò23; Emmy James (TD ‚Äò23) and Lasslo Kopits (KBB); Alina Martel (Œ£ŒëŒß), TC ‚Äò23; and Catherine Zhang (UWW), SM ‚Äò23. *The Announcer announces and performs the halftime shows during football games, and works closely with Mark Ryba, the play-by-play announcer for Yale football. The current announcer is Aidan Houlihan (TC '21). The band performs at most Yale football, basketball, and hockey events, and travels with Yale athletic teams across the country. It makes regular appearances in New York's Village Halloween Parade. It has been featured on Good Morning America and in many newspapers. The repertoire of the YPMB is constantly evolving, driven by student arrangers and pop music trends. Besides standard types of band instruments, the YPMB includes violins, bagpipes, accordions, keyboards, keytars, musical saws, and air guitars, and in 1973, was the first scatter band to incorporate electric guitars. The YPMB's \\"Squids\\" section creates large cardboard props for halftime shows. The Squids evolved from the \\"Appoges\\" (after \\"appoggiatura\\", a grace note) of the 1980s and 1990s, who handled props but also carried their own \\"instruments\\" (frisbees, stuffed giraffes, lounge chairs). The Squids have also been known to handle more visually stunning aspects of the halftime show, such as flaming sousaphones, blank-loaded firearms, and other non-traditional marching band additions. The appearance at certain games of smoke- and flame-producing pyrotechnics has also been linked to the YPMB Squids, but this has never been successfully confirmed via official channels. Squid alumni have gone on to join The Flaming Lotus Girls, The Cacophony Society, professional pyrotechnic companies, and other groups. YPMB uniforms consist of white pants and dark blue blazers with the University emblem for football games; signature t-shirts for basketball and volleyball games; and hockey jerseys for hockey, lacrosse, and most other sports. The Game For the annual Harvard-Yale game - The Game - the YPMB puts on its largest halftime show of the year, featuring enormous three-dimensional props. Known as \\"√úberprops\\", these typically serve as a means of destroying John Harvard. An Unterprop is the opposite of an √úberprop. An Unterprop would be used to represent John Harvard and would be destroyed by the band during the halftime show. An Unterprop was used for the first time in 2001. =√úberprops= √úberprop \\"Dmitri\\" at The Game 2010 (in attack position) √úberprop \\"Peggy\\" at The Game 2006 (wings folded) *2019: \\"Corneleous,\\" a 20-foot-long lion with moving neck, jaw, and legs.

(The content of this graffiti caused the band's director to suspend the band from upcoming performances and appearances.) *2007: Three pterodactyls in the service of Harvard. *2006: A hydra that sprouted two heads when one was cut off. *2005: A Helium-filled observation balloon (the first ever flying √ºnterprop), Yale biplanes (Allies) and Harvard triplanes (German). *2004: The \\"HSS Compensation,\\" a long ship operated by John Harvard and commandeered by \\"Alain.\\" *2001: The Harvard Castle, attacked by \\"Peaches\\" the dragon. Notable stunts On October 27, 1973 in a rare political statement, the YPMB reacted to Richard Nixon's \\"Saturday Night Massacre\\" (wherein he ordered the firing of the special prosecutor assigned to investigate Watergate) by forming a major \\"H\\" on the field and playing \\"10,000 Men of Harvard\\". The band paid tribute Harvard Graduate Elliot Richardson who resigned rather than carry out the order to fire Harvard Law professor Archibald Cox. The order was carried out by Yale Law professor Robert Bork. In September 1977, at the conclusion of the halftime show at the Yale-Brown game, the YPMB formed a giant diaper on the field. The members of the YPMB dropped their pants en masse to reveal that all members were wearing diapers. (The band marched \\"Down the Field\\" with their pants around their ankles.) The announcer stated that the YPMB was the \\"Most Pampered Band in the Country\\" as they marched off. This became known as one of its more infamous stunts; the band parodied that stunt at the Princeton game in 1983, where the band dropped its pants en masse again, this time to reveal that all members were wearing sweat pants underneath their white uniform pants. In October 1985, six YPMB members were suspended after dropping their pants at halftime during the Yale- Holy Cross game. Only one week earlier, the band was forbidden by West Point officials from performing its halftime show during the Army-Yale game for the script's insinuation that certain government officials were communists. The following season, in the Yale-Army game at New Haven, the YPMB took the unusual step of marching in straight lines for several minutes before breaking into its usual scatter formations. (NYT 10/7/86, B4) Before the band left the field, members removed their blue blazers on the field, spelling out \\"USA.\\" In 1992, before the combined playing of the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\", the Harvard marching band attempted to \\"X-out\\" the Yale Precision Marching Band while the Yale band stood in its traditional Y formation; however, the Yale band caught wind of this plan and, as the Harvard band marched onto the field, shifted its formation into a large H, thus making Harvard X itself out. In 1992, the Yale- Fordham halftime featured the marriage of two former band members, Drum Major James Lockman '89 and Props Goddess Rori Myers '92. (\\"At Yale, Wedding Band Takes On a New Meaning\\", New York Times, October 10, 1992.) During the ceremony, the band formed a three-tiered wedding cake; at each corner of the cake, serving as a candle, was a sousaphone that was on fire. In 2012, they celebrated their 20th anniversary during the pregame show at the Yale- Princeton game. In 1993, the Yale-Harvard halftime show included the \\"assassination\\" of the Energizer Bunny(a bass drum player)  the band formed a forty-yard bow and arrow, and \\"shot\\" the arrow at the Bunny. After they missed, the drum major took out a shotgun and blew the Bunny away. He was carried off by band members dressed as dining hall workers. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, the YPMB became a source of minor controversy for performing a halftime show parodying the history of jingoism in American media and culture, including patriotic bowdlerization, and addressing the possibility of conscription. A strong negative reaction from several audience members, including boos (especially when \\"War\\" was spelled on the field) and angry letters to administrators and newspapers, led the band to limit the often aggressive political content of its shows through at least the 2002 season. Negative reactions were heightened by the fact the show took place on Yale Parents' Weekend. Drum Majors YPMB Drum Majors are the political, social, and spiritual leaders of the band. They are usually elected by committee in January, and serve their sentence through the subsequent football season. Most Drum Majors are elected in their junior year, passing the torch to the next generation before they graduate. The current Drum Major is Elizabeth Calabresi, TC '21.

In particular, social choice theoretic methods are often used to describe and (axiomatically) analyze the performance of rules or institutions. The outcomes of the rules or institutions described are then analyzed by game theory, where the individuals/parties/nations involved in a given interaction are modeled as rational agents playing a game, guided by self-interest. Based on this assumption, the outcome of the interactions can be predicted as an equilibrium of the game. The founder of the field was William H. Riker. In his book The Theory of Political Coalitions (1962), he applied the principles of game theory to the study of politics. Positive political theory has been used to study democratic institutions such as political bargaining. PPT allows researchers to determine how outcomes of political bargaining differ based on whether political actors are equals or if power is unevenly distributed. PPT also permits the identification of institutional and contextual mechanisms that give some group members additional influence in determining collective outcomes. By focusing on the mechanisms, PPT also allows researchers to determine if outcomes are a result of asymmetric bargaining or deliberative persuasion.

The service was inaugurated on September 2, 1940. To promote the new train, KCS held a beauty contest to find \\"Miss Southern Belle,\\" a young woman whose image would be used in advertising materials systemwide. Local competitions were held before the train's launch in all of the cities that the KCS served. The ultimate winner of the competition, Margaret Landry, was the winner of the local competition in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. She was selected as \\"Miss Southern Belle\\" at the final competition in New Orleans, Louisiana, on August 24, 1940. She briefly became a screen actress, being most famous for her cameo as Teresa Guadalupe in The Leopard Man of 1943. The last run of the Southern Belle was on November 3, 1969. 1953 derailment On April 29, 1953, heavy rainfall washed out a section of track near Montgomery, Louisiana, causing five cars of the train to derail. There were 10 injuries. Equipment used tavern-observation car. A radio allowed broadcasts and music to be heard throughout the train. The Southern Belle in 1959 The Southern Belle at Pittsburg, KS on July 30, 1967 Just before inauguration, Pullman-Standard delivered three new lightweight passenger car sets to the KCS for use on the Southern Belle. Each set consisted of a combination baggage-RPO-dormitory (car numbers 64, 65 and 66), a 74-seat coach chair car (cars 234, Pittsburg; 235, Joplin; and 236, Texarkana), and a dining-observation car (car numbers 54, Kansas City; 55, Shreveport; and 56, New Orleans). The KCS rebuilt five heavyweight Pullman sleepers for use on the Southern Belle, making them look like their lightweight counterparts and increasing the number of double bedrooms in each. Cars Siloam Springs (formerly McBurney) and Sulphur Springs (formerly McLarty) were rebuilt in time for the train's inauguration. Initially, Pullman service was only offered between New Orleans and Shreveport, Louisiana. In 1941, car Barksdale (formerly McAllisterville) was added to the train's operation when Pullman service was extended from Shreveport to Kansas City. The first two rebuilt cars were joined a few months later by rebuilt cars State Capital (formerly McElheran) and Mena (formerly McKullo) on the southern leg of the train's schedule. After World War II, the train was re-equipped with some new cars built in 1948 by American Car and Foundry (ACF), and by rebuilding some of the original Pullman-Standard cars. Two of the diner-observation cars were rebuilt into tavern-observation cars; car 54, Kansas City (renamed to Good Cheer), and 55, Shreveport (renamed Hospitality), remained in Southern Belle service. The new cars built by ACF equipped two new consists and entered regular service on April 3, 1949. Each of the new consists included: * one combination baggage-RPO-dormitory (car #67 and #68) * one 62-seat coach chair car (car #239, Kansas City; and #240, Texarkana) * two 60-seat coach chair cars (car #241, Shreveport; #242, Alexandria; #243, Baton Rouge; and #244, New Orleans) * one 36-seat diner (car #57, Old Plantation; and #58, Mountain Home) * four 14-roomette, 4-double bedroom sleepers (cars Arthur Stilwell, Colonel Fordyce, Harvey Couch, Job Edson, Leonor Loree, Stuart Knott, William Buchanan and William Edenborn) KCS was pro-passenger until the Postal Service terminated mail contracts in 1967. Previous to that, KCS had continued to purchase new baggage/express cars, as well as the last intercity coaches by Pullman-Standard in 1965. Full dining car service was reduced to meals in ex- NYC tavern observation cars which had been modified with lunch counters serving food selections from a reduced menu, which was termed \\"cafe car service\\" by KCS. This new service was aimed at the now mostly coach travelers who continued to patronize these trains. Spartian interiors, which greatly simplified servicing, included tile floors, vinyl seating, dark green tinted windows which eliminated the need for window shades, and fixed vestibule steps, were among the cost saving features that were found the new 1965 coaches, as well as the older coaches remaining in service, and in all the ex- NYC observation cafe cars. KCS wisely recognized the need to keep costs to a minimum, while continuing to provide a high level of service that was satisfactory to the remaining patrons. The previously-mentioned tavern- observation cars rounded out the ends of the two consists. Between 1962 and 1964, these cars were renumbered and the car names were dropped. The train's consists remained relatively unchanged between 1948 and the end of 1968 with Pullman and meal service, although in later years the diner-lounge cars were replaced by the ex-NYC tavern observation cars serving meals and beverages. When Pullman closed its doors on December 31, 1968, KCS elected not to continue sleeping car service and it was discontinued. From January 1, 1969, until November 2, 1969, the train operated with only a baggage car, coaches, and the Ex-NYC observation cars. One of the ex-NYC cars is on display in the town of Jackson, La. Several of the 1965-vintage Pullman-Standard coaches remain in regular service today with the North Carolina DOT \\"Piedmont\\" passenger train service between Raleigh and Charlotte. Good Cheer has been preserved by the Gulf Coast Chapter NRHS, which displays the car at the Houston Railroad Museum. New Southern Belle In May 1995 the new president of the railroad, Michael Haverty, ordered the creation of an executive train to entertain shippers and guests. Under his direction, four former Canadian National locomotives, three EMD FP9As and an F9B, were purchased and painted a very dark green, similar to the paint scheme of the business fleet. Numbered 1-4 and named Meridian, Shreveport, Pittsburgh, and Vicksburg, they were placed into executive service. In 2007, KCS changed the paint scheme to the more traditional and \\"heritage\\" paint scheme. The locomotive #4 was also removed from service, and later renumbered 34 and donated to the Kansas City Union Station Rail Experience. In December the train pulls the Holiday Express, and it makes the rounds to several KCS cities and stations.

Philip Wharton, 1st Duke of Wharton (21 December 1698 ‚Äì 31 May 1731) was a powerful Jacobite politician, was one of the few people in English history, and the first since the 15th century, to have been raised to a Dukedom whilst still a minor and not closely related to the monarch. Youth He was the son of Thomas \\"Honest Tom\\" Wharton, the Whig partisan, and his second wife Lucy Loftus. When Thomas died in 1715, Philip, then 16 years old, succeeded him as 2nd Marquess of Wharton and 2nd Marquess of Malmesbury in the Peerage of Great Britain and 2nd Marquess of Catherlough in the Peerage of Ireland. Just a month after he inherited his titles, he eloped with Martha Holmes, the daughter of Major- General Richard Holmes. Wharton did not get control of his father's extensive estate, for it was put in the care of Philip's mother and Thomas's Whig party friends. Thereafter, young Wharton began to travel. He had been raised with an excellent education and prepared for a life as a public speaker, and Wharton was eloquent and witty. He travelled to France and Switzerland with a severe Calvinist tutor whose authority he resented. He met with James Francis Edward Stuart, the \\"Old Pretender\\" and son of James II, sometimes known in Europe as the rightful James III, or Prince James, the Prince of Wales (James Francis Edward Stuart; \\"The Old Pretender\\" or \\"The Old Chevalier\\"; 10 June 1688 ‚Äì an orphan in 1701, aged 13‚Äì1 January 1766) who created him Jacobite Duke of Northumberland in 1716. Wharton then went to Ireland where, at the age of 18, he entered the Irish House of Lords as Marquess of Catherlough. When he was 19 years old, in 1718, he was created Duke of Wharton by George I in the King's effort to solidify his support. In 1719, Wharton's wife gave birth to a son named Thomas, but the baby died in a smallpox epidemic the next year. From that point on, Wharton had little to do with his wife. Political life The Duke of Wharton. Wharton turned Jacobite when travelling in 1716, or at least nominally Jacobite. He began signing his name \\"Philip James Wharton\\" to indicate his allegiance. Because he was a powerful speaker, an elegant writer, a wealthy (initially) peer, and a man with a title, the new Hanoverians always sought to gain him as an ally, while the old Jacobites were, at least initially, zealous to keep him on their side. Even before his losses in the South Sea Bubble stock market crash of 1720, Wharton incurred heavy debts. He was so indebted that he sold his Irish estates and used that money to invest in South Sea Company stock. When the bubble burst, he lost the staggering sum of ¬£120,000 (in an era when a middle class salary in London might be ¬£200 a year). In response, he hired musicians and a hearse and held a public funeral for the South Sea Company. Wharton began to borrow money from Jacobite bankers and accumulated more debts. In 1719 Wharton is credited with founding the original Hellfire Club.Blackett-Ord p. 44 (not related to Dashwood's Hell-fire Club), which primarily performed parodies of religious rites. He became Grand Master of the Premier Grand Lodge of England in 1723, and was active in the House of Lords in opposition to Robert Walpole. In 1723, he wrote and spoke in favour of the exoneration of Francis Atterbury, the accused Jacobite bishop, although Atterbury's Jacobitism was superficial. He published The True Briton as a periodical to oppose the rise of Walpole. He was in favour of the Pretender not for religious or nationalist reasons but, he explained, because he was a true Old Whig like his father, whose principles had been betrayed by Walpole and the new non-native royals. His substantive change to Jacobitism occurred in 1725, when Wharton joined Earl Orrery in attacking the court. He made allies among city politicians, which was valuable to the Jacobites as Jacobitism had previously been associated with Scotland and disaffected country squires. The city had been a Whig stronghold and any erosion in their support would have powerful consequences. Indeed, although Wharton did not benefit from it, much of this would bear fruit in the emergence of the Patriot Whigs a few years later. At the same time, Wharton was ¬£70,000 in debt. Debt and decline Tomb of the Duke of Wharton in Poblet Wharton's debts were impossible for him to overcome. He accepted or sought the position as Jacobite ambassador to the Holy Roman Empire in Vienna in 1725, but the Austrians did not like Wharton, whom they did not consider a satisfactory diplomat. His dissipated lifestyle also offended the more severe Austrians. He then went to Rome, where James gave him the Order of the Garter, which Wharton wore publicly. He moved on to Madrid. Wharton's wife died in 1726, and he married Maria Theresa O'Neill O'Beirne, a Maid of Honour to the Queen, only three months later. She was the daughter of Colonel Henry O'Beirne, an Irish officer in the service of Spain, and his wife Henrietta O'Neill. Walpole's spies were informed of Wharton's activities and other Jacobites considered him a dangerous person to be near. Additionally, his behaviour was growing more offensive, mainly with drunkenness, but also with inappropriate actions. At the reception for his wedding, he exposed himself to the wedding party (and bride) to show her \\"what she was to have that night in her Gutts\\" (cited in Smith). Even Francis Atterbury condemned him. In 1728, Wharton began to help Nathaniel Mist with Mist's Weekly Journal. He wrote the infamous \\"Persian Letter\\" that caused the Walpole ministry to respond violently with arrests and the destruction of the presses. The power of Wharton's name and eloquence was such that Walpole offered Wharton a pardon and forgiveness of his debts if he were to agree to leave off writing. He also wrote, that year, a powerful piece against the \\"corruption\\" of Whig causes under Walpole entitled, \\"Reasons for Leaving his Native Country.\\" Edward Young modelled \\"Lorenzo\\" in Night Thoughts on Wharton. Alexander Pope referred to Wharton as \\"the scorn and wonder of our days\\" ‚Äì a man \\"Too rash for thought, for action too refined\\" (Epistle to Sir Richard Temple). Wharton was soon stealing food from acquaintances and seeking money anywhere he could get it. He sold his title back to George I and took a position as a lieutenant colonel in the Jacobite forces in the Spanish army fighting England. He took up arms, therefore, against his native country, and this warranted a charge of treason in 1729. In the siege at Gibraltar in 1727, Wharton sought to prove that he was not a coward, and so he charged at the head of his men and was wounded in the foot. Before the treason charge, Wharton fitfully attempted a reconciliation with George. He offered to give Walpole's spies intelligence, but they rejected him as of little value, and he returned to Madrid to live on his army pay alone. When he was insulted by a valet, he caned him and was imprisoned briefly before being banished. In 1730, he renounced James and the Jacobite cause. In advanced stages of alcoholism, he and his wife moved to the Royal Cistercian Abbey of Poblet, in Catalonia, where he died 1 June 1731. His widow returned to London, with the aid of James. When Wharton's will was proved in court in 1736, she was able to live comfortably in society in London. Wharton's titles became extinct on his death, other than Baron Wharton which was inherited by his sister Jane Wharton, 7th Baroness Wharton.

The navy's vessels served almost exclusively on the Delaware River, and were active (in conjunction with ships of the Continental Navy) in first defending the approaches to the city of Philadelphia during the British campaign that successfully occupied the city in 1777, and then preventing (at least for a time) the Royal Navy from resupplying the occupying army. The Naval Militia would also be reactivated in the late 19th to early 20th century. As under 10 U.S. Code ¬ß7851 naval militias form part of the United States organized militia and therefore are considered as such, the Pennsylvania Navy may be in any point in the future reactivated through either the office of the Governor of Pennsylvania and/or by legislative action committed by the bicameral Pennsylvania General Assembly. History When the American Revolutionary War broke out in early 1775, the colony of Pennsylvania's Committee of Safety decided that the colony's capital and seat of the Second Continental Congress, Philadelphia, would need to be protected against the incursions of British naval vessels on the Delaware River. On July 6, 1775 it authorized the purchase and outfitting of ships for that purpose.Paullin, p. 374 Two days later it placed its first order for an armed galley. By October thirteen such boats had been built, at a cost of ¬£550 each, and outfitted with a single cannon in the bow,Paullin, p. 375 and appointed Thomas Read as commodore of the fleet. The first six were launched by July 19, and another six had been launched by the end of August. Their names were: Bulldog, Burke, Camden, Congress, Dickinson, Effingham I, Experiment, Franklin, Hancock, Ranger and Warren. Additionally, 10 fire rafts were built in late 1775 and early 1776 and placed under the command of Captain John Hazelwood; the Arnold and the Putnam were built as floating batteries and were manned by Pennsylvania State Marines. In April 1776 the state acquired the Montgomery, which Read served as captain of until he received a Continental Navy commission in October 1776. By the end of August 1776, the Pennsylvania State Navy consisted of 768 men manning 27 vessels, with 21 more smaller vessels on order. These were armed with a four-pounder gun in the bow and were classed as guard boats. Administration and command The navy fell under the broad control of the Committee of Safety, which established subcommittees to manage the navy's operations and acquisitions. When the state established a new constitution, with a Supreme Executive Council as its executive, the navy's administration was assigned to the Council of Safety. In March 1777 the council established a naval board, which had full responsibility for the fleet, with the exception of the issuance of officer commissions, which authority the council retained. Overall naval command of the fleet was at times contentious. Thomas Read served as its first commodore, but he was replaced on January 13, 1776 by Thomas Caldwell, who only served briefly, resigning due to poor health in March. His replacement, Samuel Davidson, was promoted by the committee ahead of other captains, and almost caused a mutiny.Paullin, p. 378 As a result, Davidson was first removed from fleet command, and then eventually dismissed from the navy. Fleet command was then given to Thomas Seymour, but Captain Hazelwood objected to serving under the elderly Seymour. When British operations began to threaten Philadelphia in September 1777, the council dismissed Seymour and gave overall fleet command to Hazelwood.Paullin, p. 380 In September 1778, the state established an admiralty court to adjudicate maritime cases and deal with the distribution of prizes. While no explicit legislation authorizing privateering appears to have been passed, the state did issue more than 400 letters of marque between 1776 and 1782. Operations The navy saw action on May 6, 1776, when they engaged the British ships Roebuck 44 and Liverpool 28. The British were forced to withdraw to Newcastle, Delaware. The fleet was also active in keeping British troops away from the river's eastern shore when General George Washington retreated across New Jersey following the loss of New York City. Hazelwood was instrumental in preventing German troops from quartering in Burlington, New Jersey, a town sympathetic to the Loyalist cause, by bombarding it when troops were spotted there. This forced their commander, Carl von Donop, to quarter his troops much more widely, and may have contributed to Washington's successful battle at Trenton on December 26, 1776. The Pennsylvania State Navy was responsible for defense of the river when Philadelphia was occupied by British General Sir William Howe, and the Royal Navy wanted to resupply Howe's army. At first the combined Pennsylvania and Continental fleet was successful, repulsing one attempt by the British to pass the defenses of Forts Mercer and Mifflin on October 22 and 23, 1777 with the destruction of two British ships. The two forts were taken by land forces in November, and the navy was then forced to withdraw upriver. Unfavorable winds slowed their progress, and four ships (Montgomery, Delaware, Arnold, and Putnam) were burned to prevent their capture.Paullin, p. 385 In April 1778 most of the fleet was destroyed in advance of expected British operations against it. However, news that the British were going to withdraw from Philadelphia led to its resurrection, and in July Captain Hazelwood reported that the brig Convention was ready for action. Its existence as a significant force was limited by the arrival of a French fleet on the North American coast, and in August 1778 the state's assembly voted to sell off most of its remaining ships, keeping only the Convention and a few smaller ships. The smaller ships proved inadequate protection for the trade ships of Pennsylvania's merchants. In response to their petitions, the state authorized the construction of the General Greene in March 1779. Under her captain, James Montgomery, she cruised between New York and the Chesapeake Bay, often in conjunction with Continental Navy ships or privateers, and sent a number of prizes to Philadelphia. According to Montgomery, her crew was virtually unmanageable, and she was sold at the end of the 1779 sailing season. Her unusually low sales price aroused suspicions of collusion in the process.Paullin, p. 391 By 1782 the activities of the Royal Navy and Loyalist privateers again spurred Philadelphia's merchants to petition for better naval defenses. This resulted in the commissioning of the Hyder Ally, which was outfitted by the merchants, and placed under the command of the Continental Navy's Joshua Barney. After the successful capture of HMS General Monk, Barney took over her command, renaming her Washington. After a trip to the West Indies, she was sold to the Continental Navy. The Hyder Ally continued to patrol without significant success. By February 1783, with peace appearing to near, most of the state's ships had been sold and its sailors dismissed. On April 10, 1783 the Supreme Executive Council ordered the remaining armed vessels to be disposed of. Later naval militia In April 1889, the Pennsylvania Naval Militia was reconstituted as the Naval Force of Pennsylvania  one of many organized state naval militias which were the predecessors to the modern day Naval Reserve.

Similarly, a non-conservative extension is a supertheory which is not conservative, and can prove more theorems than the original. More formally stated, a theory T_2 is a (proof theoretic) conservative extension of a theory T_1 if every theorem of T_1 is a theorem of T_2, and any theorem of T_2 in the language of T_1 is already a theorem of T_1. More generally, if \\\\Gamma is a set of formulas in the common language of T_1 and T_2, then T_2 is \\\\Gamma-conservative over T_1 if every formula from \\\\Gamma provable in T_2 is also provable in T_1. Note that a conservative extension of a consistent theory is consistent. If it were not, then by the principle of explosion, every formula in the language of T_2 would be a theorem of T_2, so every formula in the language of T_1 would be a theorem of T_1, so T_1 would not be consistent. Hence, conservative extensions do not bear the risk of introducing new inconsistencies. This can also be seen as a methodology for writing and structuring large theories: start with a theory, T_0, that is known (or assumed) to be consistent, and successively build conservative extensions T_1, T_2, ... of it. Recently, conservative extensions have been used for defining a notion of module for ontologies: if an ontology is formalized as a logical theory, a subtheory is a module if the whole ontology is a conservative extension of the subtheory. An extension which is not conservative may be called a proper extension. Examples ACA0 (a subsystem of second-order arithmetic) is a conservative extension of first-order Peano arithmetic. * Von Neumann‚ÄìBernays‚ÄìG√∂del set theory is a conservative extension of Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC). * Internal set theory is a conservative extension of Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC). * Extensions by definitions are conservative. * Extensions by unconstrained predicate or function symbols are conservative. * IŒ£1 (a subsystem of Peano arithmetic with induction only for Œ£01-formulas) is a Œ†02-conservative extension of the primitive recursive arithmetic (PRA).Fernando Ferreira, A Simple Proof of Parsons‚Äô Theorem.

Model-theoretic conservative extension With model-theoretic means, a stronger notion is obtained: an extension T_2 of a theory T_1 is model-theoretically conservative if T_1 \\\\subseteq T_2 and every model of T_1 can be expanded to a model of T_2. Each model-theoretic conservative extension also is a (proof-theoretic) conservative extension in the above sense. The model theoretic notion has the advantage over the proof theoretic one that it does not depend so much on the language at hand; on the other hand, it is usually harder to establish model theoretic conservativity.

Granite blocks from Khafre's complex went into the lining and > blocking of Amenemhat I's descending passage. We can only conclude that they > were picked up at Saqqara and Giza and brought to Lisht to be incorporated > into the pyramid for their spiritual efficacy.Lehner, Mark The Complete > Pyramids, London: Thames and Hudson (1997)p.168 When the limestone outer layer was taken, the core slumped. The pyramid and temple have been used as a source of material for lime burners so only a small amount remains today. Isometric image taken from a 3-D model The Middle Kingdom pyramids were built closer to the Nile and Amenemhet I's burial chamber is now underwater because the River Nile has shifted course. The complex has an inner wall of limestone and an outer wall of mudbrick; members of the Royal family were buried between these two walls. There are a number of mastaba tombs between the walls and 22 burial shafts on the western side of the pyramid. His son Senusret I followed in his footsteps, building his pyramid - a closer reflection of the 6th dynasty pyramids than that of Amenemhat I - at Lisht as well, but his grandson, Amenemhat II, broke with this tradition.  Assassination  Two literary works dating from the end of the reign give a picture about Amenemhat I's death. The Instructions of Amenemhat were supposedly counsels that the deceased king gave to his son during a dream. In the passage where he warns Senusret I against too great intimacy with his subjects, he tells the story of his own death as a reinforcement: This passage refers to a conspiracy in which Amenemhat was killed by his own guards, when his son and co-regent Senusret I was leading a campaign in Libya. Another account of the following events is given in the Story of Sinuhe, a famous text of Egyptian literature:  Succession  The double dated stela CG 20516 Amenemhat I is considered to be the first king of Egypt to have had a coregency with his son, Senusret I. A double dated stela from Abydos and now in the Cairo Museum (CG 20516) is dated to the Year 30 of Amenemhat I and to the Year 10 of Senusret I, which establishes that Senusret was made co-regent in Amenemhat's Year 20.Murnane, William J. Ancient Egyptian Coregencies, Studies in Ancient Oriental Civilization. No. 40. p.2. The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, 1977. Modern adaptation Naguib Mahfouz, the Nobel Prize-winning Egyptian writer, includes Amenemhat I in one of his stories published in 1941 entitled \\"Awdat Sinuhi\\". The story appeared in an English translation by Raymond Stock in 2003 as \\"The Return of Sinuhe\\" in the collection of Mahfouz's short stories entitled Voices from the Other World. The story is based directly on the \\"Story of Sinuhe\\", although adding details of a lovers' triangle romance involving Amenemhat I and Sinuhe that does not appear in the original. Mahfouz also includes the pharaoh in his account of Egypt's rulers \\"Facing the Throne\\".

Interferometry Interferometry inherently depends on the wave nature of the object. As pointed out by de Broglie in his PhD thesis, particles, including neutrons, can behave like waves (the so-called wave‚Äìparticle duality, now explained in the general framework of quantum mechanics). The wave functions of the individual interferometer paths are created and recombined coherently which needs the application of dynamical theory of diffraction. Neutron interferometers are the counterpart of X-ray interferometers and are used to study quantities or benefits related to thermal neutron radiation. Applications Neutron interferometers are used to determine minute quantum-mechanical effects on the neutron wavefunction, such as studies of the Aharonov‚ÄìBohm effect, gravity acting on an elementary particle, the neutron, rotation of the earth acting on a quantum system and they can be applied for neutron phase imaging, and tests of the dynamical theory of diffraction. Construction Like X-ray interferometers, neutron interferometers are typically made from a single large crystal of silicon, often 10 to 30 or more centimeters in diameter and 20 to 60 cm or more in length. Modern semiconductor technology allows large single-crystal silicon boules to be easily grown. Since the boule is a single crystal, the atoms in the boule are precisely aligned, to within small fractions of a nanometer or an angstrom, over the entire boule. The interferometer is created by removing all but three slices of silicon, held in perfect alignment by a base. (image) Neutrons impinge on the first slice, where, by diffraction from the crystalline lattice, they separate into two beams. At the second slice, they are diffracted again, with two beams continuing on to the third slice. At the third slice, the beams recombine, interfering constructively or destructively, completing the interferometer. Without the precise, angstrom-level alignment of the three slices, the interference results would not be meaningful. Cold neutrons Only recently, a neutron interferometer for cold and ultracold neutrons was designed and successfully run. Neutron-optical components in this case comprise three gratings. They are artificially holographically produced, i.e., by means of a light-optic two-wave interference setup illuminating a photo-neutron- refractive polymer.  References  V. F.

Its members have served in the armed forces and as ambassadors and politicians, including Governor General of India and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The family is related to the British Royal Family via Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother's maternal Cavendish-Bentinck line. History The name Bentinck is a patronymic variation of the Old Germanic name Bento. The family is originally from the East of the Netherlands, and is regarded as Uradel noble, or noble from earliest times. The oldest known ancestor is Johan Bentinck, who is mentioned in documents between 1343 and 1386 and owned land near Heerde. An important British branch was founded by Hans Willem Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland who accompanied William Henry, Prince of Orange to England during the Glorious Revolution. The head of this line was initially given the title of Earl of Portland, later Duke of Portland. In 1732 the title Graf (Count) Bentinck, of the Holy Roman Empire, was created for William Bentinck, son of the 1st Earl of Portland. A Royal Licence of 1886 was created which allowed the use of this title in England. The Royal Warrant of 27 April 1932 abolished the use of Foreign Titles in the United Kingdom, but extended the special allowance in 13 cases, including the Bentinck countly title \\"during the lives of the present holders, their heirs, and their heir's heir, provided such heir's heir is now in existence.\\" That exception has now expired.http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/TNA/HO_45_25906.htm Another branch with the title Count existed in the Netherlands, but died out in the male line. The Dutch and British branches of the family continue to exist and belong to both the Dutch nobility and British nobility. =The Lordship of In- and Kniphausen= The counts of Bentinck were sovereign rulers of the Lordship of In- and Kniphausen, a territory of two parts in and around what is now the city of Wilhelmshaven. Originally subject to Brussels, the general reorganisation of the Holy Empire in 1803 (Reichsdeputationshauptschluss) granted Imperial immediacy until the dissolution of the Holy Empire in 1806. The Lordship maintained a precarious independence until 1810, when France annexed it and the whole German North Sea coast to enforce the Continental System. At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the Lordship was denied admittance to the German Confederation in deference to Tsar Alexander I, who wished to see the territory annexed by his cousin, the Grand Duke of Oldenburg. Count Bentinck fought for his little state, however, and at the Congress of Aix-la- Chapelle in 1818, the Great Powers agreed that the Count's territory should be granted limited sovereignty. The Frankfurt Convention of July 10, 1819 recognised In- and Kniphausen as sovereign within its own borders but under the protection of Oldenburg.Twiss, Travers: The Law of Nations Considered as Independent Political Communities, Oxford University Press, 1861, pages 30-32. The Treaty of Berlin on June 8, 1825 finalized the terms. In- and Kniphausen was permitted its own commercial flag, which its vessels bore on the high seas.Hertslet, Edward: The Map of Europe by Treaty, 1875, pages 723-726. Nevertheless, there was a long dispute between the Oldenburg and the Bentinck families in the latter's inheritance. This dispute was not ended until 1854 with a settlement in which the Bentinck family renounced its sovereignty for financial compensation and certain property rights. The Counts of Bentinck no longer claimed sovereignty over In- and Kniphausen. Even before thw final settlement, Oldenburg and Prussia had negotiated the Treaty of Jade of 1853 in which Oldenburg agreed to sell 340 hectares of Kniphausen territory to Prussia as a naval station for its North Sea Fleet. The cession became the city of Wilhelmshaven. Today The Dutch estate of the Bentinck family since the 16th century, , is situated between the villages Heeten and Raalte in Overijssel. The area contains 5 square kilometres of forests and cultivated land. Nowadays, the family mainly earns its living by forestry, agriculture and renting holiday houses. The British branch of the family owns Bothal Castle (Bothal Estates) in Northumberland and Welbeck Abbey (Welbeck Estates), the ancestral seat of the Dukes of Portland in Nottinghamshire.

The studio's films are distributed worldwide by Sony Pictures Releasing under their Columbia Pictures label, while all direct-to-video releases are released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. The first film produced by Sony Pictures Animation, Open Season, was released on September 29, 2006. Its latest release was The Angry Birds Movie 2 on August 13, 2019, with their next scheduled release set to be Connected with an unspecified 2020 release. History In 2001, Sony Pictures considered selling off its visual effects facility Sony Pictures Imageworks but after failing to find a suitable buyer, having been impressed with the CGI sequences of Stuart Little 2 and seeing the box office successes of DreamWorks Animation's Shrek and Disney/Pixar's Monsters, Inc., SPI was reconfigured to become an animation studio. Astro Boy, which had been in development at Sony since 1997 as a live- action film, was set to be SPI's first all-CGI film, but never made it to fruition. On May 9, 2002, Sony Pictures Animation was established to develop characters, stories and movies with SPI taking over the digital production while maintaining its visual effects production. Meanwhile, SPI produced two short films, the Academy Award-winning The ChubbChubbs! and Early Bloomer, as a result of testing its strengths and weaknesses in producing all-CGI animation. On its first anniversary on May 9, 2003, Sony Pictures Animation announced a full slate of animated projects in development: Open Season, an adaptation of a Celtic folk ballad Tam Lin, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Surf's Up, and a feature-length film version of The ChubbChubbs!. Its first feature film was Open Season, released in September 2006, which became Sony's second-highest-grossing home entertainment film in 2007 and spawned three direct-to-video sequels. Its second feature film, Surf's Up was released in June 2007, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, and won two Annie Awards. A motion-captured animated film titled Neanderthals and written and produced by Jon Favreau, was cancelled sometime in 2008 after four years in development. SPA's first 3D movie since the IMAX 3D release of Open Season, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, was released in September 2009 and was nominated for four Annie Awards, including Best Animated Feature. The Smurfs (2011) was the studio's first CGI/live-action hybrid. SPA's parent company Sony Pictures had partnered in 2007 with Aardman Animations to finance, co-produce and distribute feature films. Together, they produced two films: Arthur Christmas (2011), and The Pirates! Band of Misfits (2012), which was SPA's first stop-motion film. In September 2012, SPA released Hotel Transylvania, which grossed over $350 million worldwide and launched a successful franchise with two sequels and a TV series. Two sequels are released in 2013: The Smurfs 2 and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2. SPA's latest releases are Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, an animated superhero film based on the Spider-Man comics and featuring the Miles Morales incarnation of the character, and The Angry Birds Movie 2, a sequel to the 2016 film The Angry Birds Movie produced by Rovio Animation. SPA has since signed Genndy Tartakovsky to a long-term deal with the studio to develop and direct original films. On November 3, 2014, the studio collaborated with Frederator Studios' Cartoon Hangover on GO! Cartoons, an incubator series consisting of 12 short films, with at least one short film being developed into a series. The short films were funded by SPA, with the additional goal of attracting new talent for the studio. , the studio is working on Connected, a robot apocalypse/road trip film written and directed by Michael Rianda and Jeff Rowe while produced by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (2020), the musical film, Lin-Manuel Miranda's Vivo, which marks Sony Pictures Animation's first musical film, and Hotel Transylvania 4 (2021), and a sequel to Spider- Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2022). It has many other projects in development, including an animated Ghostbusters spin-off film,, two Genndy Tartakovsky projects: an R-rated comedy titled Fixed and Black Knight, Bubble, a co- production with Point Grey Pictures based on the podcast of the same name, Tao, a China-set science-fiction adventure film directed by The Lego Movie 2 story artist Emily Dean, Tut, an afro-futuristic coming-of-age story set in ancient Egypt directed by Hair Love creator Matthew A. Cherry, and Twigs. In June 2019, Sony Pictures Animation announced that they had launched an \\"International\\" division headed by Aron Warner at the 2019 Annecy International Animated Film Festival, with Wish Dragon set to be the division's first film. The same day, they also announced an \\"Alternative\\" division aimed at producing adult animated content, headed by Katie Baron and Kevin Noel. In addition to Tartakovsky's films Black Knight and Fixed, the division's TV shows are set to include The Boondocks, a reboot of the original TV series that originally aired on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block from 2005 to 2014; Superbago, a co-production with Stoopid Buddy Stoodios that was originally greenlit as a feature film; and Hungry Ghosts, a series based on the Dark Horse graphic novel by Anthony Bourdain and Joel Rose. They had previously announced their plans to produce adult content at the 2017 Annecy festival. According to Kristine Belson, president of SPA, the studio produces films on a 1:1 development-to-production ratio, meaning that the studio puts films into development as much as it places films in production, unlike other animation studios. Process In a similar fashion to the Warner Animation Group and Paramount Animation, the studio outsources their films to other animation companies and visual effects studios, with the majority of their films being animated by Sony Pictures Imageworks (its sister company). Some films, such as Arthur Christmas and The Pirates! Band of Misfits were acquired by Sony Pictures Animation to be released under their banner while others, such as Goosebumps and Peter Rabbit, were made with no involvement from the studio.

Background After ten years fighting in Troy, followed by ten more years struggling to get home to Ithaca, Odysseus finally arrives at his homeland. In his absence, reckless suitors have taken over his house in hopes of marrying his wife Penelope. In order to secretly re-enter his house to ultimately spring a surprise attack on the suitors, Odysseus disguises himself as a beggar, and only his son Telemachus is told of his true identity. As Odysseus approaches his home, he finds Argos lying neglected on a pile of cow manure, infested with ticks, old and very tired. This is a sharp contrast to the dog Odysseus left behind; Argos used to be known for his speed and strength and his superior tracking skills. Unlike everyone else, including Eumaios, a lifelong friend, Argos recognizes Odysseus at once and he has just enough strength to drop his ears and wag his tail but cannot get up to greet his master. Unable to greet his beloved dog, as this would betray who he really was, Odysseus passes by (but not without shedding a tear) and enters his hall, and Argos dies. The simplicity of the relationship between Argos and Odysseus allows their reunion to be immediate and sincere.Homer. Odyssey. Trans. Stanley Lombardo. Canada: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc., 2000. Print. Excerpt from the Odyssey :As they were speaking, a dog that had been lying asleep raised his head and pricked up his ears. This was Argos, whom Odysseus had bred before setting out for Troy, but he had never had any enjoyment from him. In the old days he used to be taken out by the young men when they went hunting wild goats, or deer, or hares, but now that his master was gone he was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow dung that lay in front of the stable doors till the men should come and draw it away to manure the great close; and he was full of fleas. As soon as he saw Odysseus standing there, he dropped his ears and wagged his tail, but he could not get close up to his master. When Odysseus saw the dog on the other side of the yard, dashed a tear from his eyes without Eumaios seeing it, and said: :'Eumaeus, what a noble dog that is over yonder on the manure heap: his build is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is he only one of those dogs that come begging about a table, and are kept merely for show?' :'This dog,' answered Eumaios, 'belonged to him who has died in a far country. If he were what he was when Odysseus left for Troy, he would soon show you what he could do. There was not a wild beast in the forest that could get away from him when he was once on its tracks. But now he has fallen on evil times, for his master is dead and gone, and the women take no care of him. Servants never do their work when their master's hand is no longer over them, for Zeus takes half the goodness out of a man when he makes a slave of him.' : So saying he entered the well-built mansion and made straight for the riotous pretenders in the hall. But Argos passed into the darkness of death, now that he had fulfilled his destiny of faith and seen his master once more after twenty years. :‚ÄîHomer, Odyssey, Book 17, lines 290-327 See alsoMan's best friend (phrase) *Greek mythology in popular culture *Hachik≈ç ‚Äî a real-life dog who waited for his dead owner for years after his master had died *Greyfriars Bobby ‚Äî another real-life dog who stayed by his master's grave for fourteen years *Shep (American dog) ‚Äî a real-life dog whose master's casket was taken away by train and met every train for six years until his death *Gelert (Welsh Dog) ‚Äî belonged to Llywelyn the Great, Prince of Gwynedd.

The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama died in Kochi in 1524 when he was on his third visit to India. His body was originally buried in this church, but after fourteen years his remains were moved to Lisbon.Ayub, Akber (ed), Kerala: Maps & More, Fort Kochi, 2006 edition 2007 reprint, pp. 20‚Äì24, Stark World Publishing, Bangalore, History Vasco da Gama, who discovered the sea route from Europe to India, landed at Kappad near Kozhikode (Calicut) in 1498. He was followed by Pedro √Ålvares Cabral and Afonso de Albuquerque. They built Fort Emmanuel at the Fort Kochi Beach with permission from the Raja of Cochin. Within the fort, they built a church with a wooden structure, which was dedicated to St. Bartholomew. The neighbourhood is now known as Fort Kochi. Towards the entrance in front of St Francis Church Francisco de Almeida, the Portuguese viceroy, was allowed, in 1506, by the Raja of Cochin to reconstruct wooden buildings in stone and masonry. The wooden church was rebuilt, presumably by the Franciscan friars, with bricks and mortar and a tiled roof was erected. In 1516, the new church was completed and it was dedicated to St. Anthony. Front view of the church The Franciscans retained control over the church till the Dutch captured Kochi in 1663. While the Portuguese were Roman Catholics, the Dutch were Protestants. They demolished all the churches except this one. They reconditioned it and converted it into a government church. In 1795, the British captured Kochi from the Dutch but they allowed the latter to retain the church. In 1804, the Dutch voluntarily handed over the church to the Anglican Communion. It was placed under the Ecclesiastical Department of the Government of India. It is believed that the Anglicans changed the name of the patron saint to St. Francis. The Church was declared a protected monument in April 1923 under the Protected Monuments Act of 1904. As a protected monument it is under the Archaeological Survey of India but is owned by the Kochi diocese of Church of South India. It has services on Sundays and commemorative days. On weekdays it is kept open for visitors. Vasco da Gama The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama died in Kochi in 1524 on his third visit to India. His body was originally buried in this church, but after fourteen years his remains were moved to Lisbon. The gravestone of Vasco da Gama can still be seen here. It is on the ground at the southern side. The gravestones of other Portuguese are on the northern sidewall and the Dutch on the southern wall. A cenotaph in memory of the residents of Kochi who fell in the World War I was erected in 1920.

He was most famous for his critical essay to the Jiaqing Emperor, which resulted in his banishment to Yili in Xinjiang. In modern times, he is best remembered for his essay Zhi Ping Pian (, \\"On Governance and Well-being of the Empire\\") on population growth and its sociopolitical consequence, in which he raised many of the same issues that were raised by Malthus writing during the same period in England. Life Former Residence of Hong Liangji in ChangzhouHong was born in Changzhou and was relatively slow in his accomplishment of the rank of jinshi, which he finally attained at the age of 44. He held minor government posts up until his criticism of the Jiaqing Emperor in the early nineteenth century which focused on the emperor's failure to weed out corrupt officials like Heshen or reform the bureaucracy that had allowed Heshen to secure power. Although well-intentioned and meant to serve as a call to action, the punishment for his transgression was originally decapitation, and subsequently lessened to banishment. Later, the emperor once more commuted Hong's sentence and pardoned him completely in hopes of ending a drought. Philosophy Hong was a proponent of the New Text scholarship, and felt that political remonstrance was part of his Confucian duty, as many other philosophers of his time did. He was concerned with such issues as population control, geography, the Chinese classics, and government corruption. He critically re-evaluated the common Chinese assumption that a growing population was the sign of a good government. =Zhi Ping Pian and theory on population growth= Hong's time experienced one of the fastest expansions of population in Chinese history. With the promotion of New World crops such as corn, Chinese population tripled from 100 million (1651‚Äì1661) to 300 million (1790). The population boom resulted in a series of socioeconomic problems, and caused concerns among the Mandarins. In 1791, Qianlong Emperor expressed his worry to the court officials that the resources might not be able to support the growing population. Two years later, Hong published Zhi Ping Pian, the 26th essay of his anthology Opinions (). In Zhi Ping Pian, Hong points to the tension between the growth of the means of subsistence and the growing population. He writes that the tension would be relieved by disasters, famine, and plagues. Hong points out that government can mediate the problem by policies like adjusting tax, encouraging colonization, and enhancing the social safety net. However, he expresses his concern about the limits of human policy in addressing such an inherent structural dilemma. Works Hong was a prolific writer, with more than 20 books published, including multiple volumes of essays, prose works and poems. In addition to his philosophical works, Hong was also a noted historian, known for his study of historical geography. *Letter to Prince Cheng Earnestly Discussing the Political Affairs of the Time, 1799 *Opinions, 1793 References de Bary, William Theodore and Irene Bloom, eds.

The Corps was formed by the Continental Congress on November 10, 1775 and was disbanded in 1783. Their mission was multi-purpose, but their most important duty was to serve as onboard security forces, protecting the captain of a ship and his officers. During naval engagements Marine sharpshooters were stationed in the fighting tops of the ships' masts, and were supposed to shoot the opponent's officers, naval gunners and helmsmen. In all, there were 131 Colonial Marine officers and probably no more than 2,000 enlisted Colonial Marines. Though individual Marines were enlisted for the few U.S. Naval vessels, the organization would not be re-created until 1798. Despite the gap between the disbanding of the Continental Marines and the current organization, the Continental Marines' successor, U.S. Marine Corps, marks November 10, 1775 as its inception. History Continental Marines land at New Providence during the Battle of Nassau In accordance with the Continental Marine Act of 1775, Congress decreed: These two battalions were initially intended to be drawn from George Washington's army for the planned invasion of Halifax, Nova Scotia, the main British reinforcement and supply point. In reality only one battalion was formed by December, with five companies and a total of about 300 men. Plans to form the second battalion were suspended indefinitely after several British regiments-of-foot and cavalry, supported by 3,000 Hessian mercenaries, landed in Nova Scotia, making the planned amphibious assault impossible. Washington was reluctant to support the Marines, and suggested that they be recruited from New York or Philadelphia instead. The Continental Marines' only Commandant was Captain Samuel Nicholas, commissioned on 28 November 1775; and the first Marine barracks were located in Philadelphia. Though legend places its first recruiting post at Tun Tavern, historian Edwin Simmons surmises that it was more likely the , a tavern owned by the Nicholas family. Robert Mullen, whose mother owned Tun Tavern, later received a commission as a captain in June 1776 and likely used it as his recruiting rendezvous. Four additional Marine Security Companies were also raised and helped George Washington defend Philadelphia. Marines were used by the US to carry out amphibious landings and raids during the American Revolution. Marines joined Commodore Esek Hopkins of the Continental Navy's first squadron on its first cruise in the Caribbean. They landed twice in Nassau, in the Bahamas, to capture naval supplies from the British. The first landing, named the Battle of Nassau, led by Captain Samuel Nicholas, consisted of 250 marines and sailors who landed in New Providence and marched to Nassau Town. There, they wrought havoc and seized naval stores of shells, shot, and cannon, but failed to capture any of the desperately needed gunpowder. The second landing, led by a Lieutenant Trevet, landed at night and captured several ships along with the naval stores. Sailing back to Rhode Island, the squadron captured four small prize ships. The squadron finally returned on 8 April 1776, with 7 dead marines and four wounded. Though Hopkins was disgraced for failing to obey orders, Nicholas was promoted to major on 25 June and tasked with raising 4 new companies of Marines for 4 new frigates then under construction. In December 1776, the Continental Marines were tasked to join Washington's army at Trenton to slow the progress of British troops southward through New Jersey. Unsure what to do with the Marines, Washington added the Marines to a brigade of Philadelphia militia, also dressed in green. Though they were unable to arrive in time to meaningfully affect the Battle of Trenton, they were able to fight at the Battle of Princeton. Continental Marines landed and captured Nautilus Island and the Majabagaduce peninsula in the Penobscot Expedition, but withdrew with heavy losses when Commodore Dudley Saltonstall's force failed to capture the nearby fort. A group under Navy Captain James Willing left Pittsburgh, traveled down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, captured a ship, and in conjunction with other Continental Marines, brought by ship from the Gulf of Mexico raided British Loyalists on the shore of Lake Ponchartrain. The last official act of the Continental Marines was to escort a stash of silver crowns, on loan from Louis XVI of France, from Boston to Philadelphia to enable the opening of the Bank of North America. At the end of the Revolutionary War, both the Continental Navy and Marines were disbanded in April 1783. Although individual marines stayed on for the few U.S. naval vessels left, the last Continental Marine was discharged in September. In all, there were 131 Colonial marine officers and probably no more than 2,000 enlisted Colonial marines. Though individual marines were enlisted for the few U.S. naval vessels, the organization would not be re-created until 1798. Despite the gap between the disbanding of the Continental Marines and the establishment of the actual United States Marine Corps (USMC), the USMC deems November 10, 1775 as its official founding date. This is traditional in marine units and is similar to the practice of the British and Dutch marines. Timeline ;1775, October 13: Second Continental Congress convenes and directs the acquisition, fitting out, and manning of two vessels for the Continental Navy. Since marines are a normal part of warship's complement, this is the first (albeit indirect) authorization for the enlistment of Continental Marines. ;1775, November 10: The Continental Marines are created. ;1775, December: Five companies of about 300 Marines were raised. While armed, they were not equipped with uniforms. They head South for the Caribbean where the five companies joined Commodore Esek Hopkins of the Continental Navy's first squadron on its first cruise. ;1776, March: Nicholas' Marines land on New Providence Island, Bahamas. In 13 days they secure 2 forts, occupy Nassau, control the Government House, seize 88 guns, 16,535 shells and other supplies. Returning from the raid, they encountered a British ship. Marines engaged the ship with muskets and assisted in manning the broadside cannon. Commodore Hopkins ignored his ambitious orders to sweep the southern seas of British ships, and instead raided the Bahamas for gunpowder for Washington's army. Nicholas' Marines made an opposed landing and marched on Nassau Town, on the island of New Providence, seizing shot, shells and cannon. However, a failed attempt at a surprise attack the day before had warned the defenders, who sent off their stock of gunpowder in the night. Sailing back to Rhode Island, the squadron captured four small prize ships. The squadron finally returned on April 8, 1776, with 7 dead Marines (including Lt. John Fitzpatrick), and four wounded. Though Hopkins was disgraced for failing to obey orders, Nicholas was promoted to major on June 25 and tasked with raising 4 new companies of Marines for 4 new frigates then under construction. Among the newly commissioned Marines was Captain Robert Mullan. ;1776, April: John Martin's enlistment to serve on in Philadelphia in April gave him the role as the first black Marine. ;1776, October: Sergeants William Hamilton and Alexander Neilson become the first recorded Marine mustangs when they are promoted to lieutenant. ;1776, December: Marines were tasked to join Washington's army at Trenton to slow the progress of British troops southward through New Jersey. Unsure what to do with the Marines, Washington added the Marines to a brigade of Philadelphia militia, also dressed in green. Though they were unable to arrive in time to affect the battle of Trenton, they assisted in the decisive American victory at Princeton. Later that spring, Washington incorporated some of the Marines into artillery units of his reorganized Army. ;1778, January: A Marine detachment sails down the Mississippi River and secures New Orleans to keep British traders out. Continental Marines landed and captured Nautilus Island and the Majabagaduce peninsula in the Penobscot Expedition. A group under Navy Captain James Willing left Pittsburgh, traveled down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, captured a ship and in conjunction with other Continental Marines brought by ship from the Gulf of Mexico raided British Loyalists on the shore of Lake Ponchartrain. ;1778, April: A Marine detachment nominally under the command of John Paul Jones makes two raids on British soil. ;1783, January: Marines board and seize the British ship Baille in the West Indies ;1785, June: After the end of the American Revolutionary War (January 1783), the Alliance is sold. The last official act of the Continental Marines was to escort a stash of French silver crowns on loan from Louis XVI, from Boston to Philadelphia, to enable the opening of the Bank of North America. The Continental Marines and the Continental Navy are disbanded. Continental Marine uniforms On September 5, 1776, the Naval Committee published the Continental Marines uniform regulations specifying green coats with white facings (lapels, cuffs, and coat lining), with a leather high collar to protect against cutlass slashes and to keep a man's head erect. Its memory is preserved by the moniker \\"Leatherneck\\", and the high collar on Marine dress uniforms. Though legend attributes the green color to the traditional color of riflemen, Colonial Marines carried muskets. More likely, green cloth was simply plentiful in Philadelphia, and it served to distinguish Marines from the red of the British or the blue of the Continental Army and Navy. Also, Sam Nicholas's hunting club wore green uniforms, hence his recommendation to the committee was for green. Another possible reason for the green coats with white facings is that they were using captured uniforms as many loyalist units such as the Queens Own Loyal Provincial Regiment utilizes the green faced white coats.

As a Christian religious order, it is a dispersed community of women and men, lay and clergy, from many different denominations, seeking to live the sacramental life. \\"Membership in The Order is open to persons of all Christian denominations who seek to live the sacramental life in accordance with our Rule of Life and Service, in community with and acceptance of their brothers and sisters in the Order.\\" The Order gathers annually in mid-October for several days of worship, fellowship, and administration. The Order proclaims itself as Wesleyan and Lukan in its spirituality, Methodist in its origins, sacramental in its practice, and ecumenical in its outlook. History The Order of St Luke was founded in 1946 in the former Methodist Church and, until 2012, held the status of Affiliate Organization with the Section on Worship of the General Board of Discipleship of the United Methodist Church. The Order was formed under the leadership of the Rev. R. P. Marshall, a former editor of the Christian Advocate. It was dedicated to the cause of liturgical renewal, and led the way in a serious liturgical awakening across the Methodist Church and much of post-war Protestantism. > A maturing comprehension of liturgical renewal in an ecumenical era has > become the guiding vision of members within the Order, just as it has become > a dawning concern in the minds of many persons in the Church presently > outside the Order. Recent evidence of this emerging vision may be seen in > the design of the official worship books of many denominations.

OSL Publications A major ministry of the Order of Saint Luke is OSL Publications. This ministry specializes in providing printed resources for those who lead worship and scholarly resources for those interested in liturgical matters. Publications include resources on liturgy, church architecture, prayer, theology, worship, spirituality, sacraments, and music. OSL publishes three periodicals: * Doxology - This is the annual journal with contributions from writers in the areas of liturgical and sacramental scholarship. It is a \\"juried\\" or \\"refereed\\" journal which offers a service to the academic world as well as those who are involved in the active practice of ministry in its many contexts. * Sacramental Life - This journal is published four times a year. It is designed to provide theologically sound reports of developments from across the church-at-large. Rather than have a theoretical or scholarly approach, the articles and liturgical aids have been practically proven and have grown out of the experiences of people \\"in the trenches.\\" * The Font - A once every two months in-house paper helping members to keep current on what is happening with their brothers and sisters around the world.

The phenotype (main outward appearance) of the mouse is a lack of body hair, which gives it the \\"nude\\" nickname. The nude mouse is valuable to research because it can receive many different types of tissue and tumor grafts, as it mounts no rejection response. These xenografts are commonly used in research to test new methods of imaging and treating tumors. The genetic basis of the nude mouse mutation is a disruption of the FOXN1 gene. Nomenclature The nomenclature for the nude mouse has changed several times since their discovery. Originally they were described as nu and this was updated to Hfh11nu when the mutated gene was identified as a mutation in the HNF-3/forkhead homolog 11 gene. Then in 2000 the gene responsible for the mutation was identified as a member of the Fox gene family and the nomenclature was updated to Foxn1nu. History and significance Nude mice were first discovered in 1962 by Dr. Norman R. Grist at Ruchill Hospital's Brownlee virology laboratory in Glasgow.http://animalresearch.info/en/designing-research/249/mouse- immunodeficient-/ Because they lack a thymus, nude mice cannot generate mature T lymphocytes. Therefore they are unable to mount many types of adaptive immune responses, including: #antibody formation that requires CD4+ helper T cells #cell-mediated immune responses, which require CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells #delayed-type hypersensitivity responses (require CD4+ T cells) #killing of virus-infected or malignant cells (requires CD8+ cytotoxic T cells) #graft rejection (requires both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) Because of the above features, nude mice have served in the laboratory to gain insights into the immune system, leukemia, solid tumors, AIDS and other forms of immune deficiency as well as leprosy. Moreover, the absence of functioning T cells prevents nude mice from rejecting not only allografts, but they cannot even reject xenografts; that is, grafts of tissue from another species. Most strains of nude mice are slightly \\"leaky\\" and do have a few T cells, especially as they age. For this reason, nude mice are less popular in research today, since knockout mice with more complete defects in the immune system have been constructed (e.g. RAG1 and RAG2 knockout mice). Genetics Nude mice have a spontaneous deletion in the FOXN1 gene. (Humans with mutations in FOXN1 also are athymic and immune deficient.) Mice with a targeted deletion in the FOXN1 (\\"knockout\\" mice) also show the \\"nude\\" phenotype. Since nude females have underdeveloped mammary glands and are unable to effectively nurse their young, nude males are bred with heterozygous females. Life span The life span of nude mice is normally 6 months to a year. In controlled, germ free environments and with antibiotic treatments found in many laboratories that routinely use nude mice, they can live almost as long as normal mice (18 months to two years).

(The first synagogue in India was built in the 4th century in Kodungallur (Cranganore) when the Jews had a merchantile role in the South Indian region (now called Kerala) along the Malabar coast. When the community moved to Kochi in the 14th century, it built a new synagogue there.) It is one of seven synagogues of the Malabar Yehudan or Yehudan Mappila people or Cochin Jewish community in the Kingdom of Cochin. Paradesi is a word used in several Indian languages, and the literal meaning of the term is \\"foreigners\\", applied to the synagogue because it was built by Sephardic or Portuguese-speaking Jews, some of them from families exiled in Aleppo, Safed and other West Asian localities. It is also referred to as the Cochin Jewish Synagogue or the Mattancherry Synagogue. The synagogue is located in the quarter of Old Cochin known as Jew Town, and is the only one of the seven synagogues in the area still in use. The complex has four buildings. It was built adjacent to the Mattancherry Palace temple on the land given to the Malabari Yehuden or \\"Yehuden Mappila\\" community by the Raja of Kochi, Rama Varma. The Mattancherry Palace temple and the Mattancherry synagogue share a common wall. History Entrance The Malabari Jews or Yehudan Mappila (also known as Cochin Jews) formed a prosperous trading community of Kerala, and they controlled a major portion of worldwide spice trade. In 1568, Paradesi Jews constructed the Paradesi Synagogue adjacent to Mattancherry Palace, Cochin, now part of the Indian city of Ernakulam, on land given to them by the Raja of Kochi. The first synagogue in India was built in the 4th century in Kodungallur (Cranganore) when the Jews had a merchantile role in the South Indian region (now called Kerala) along the Malabar coast. When the community moved to Kochi in the 14th century, it built a new synagogue there. The Malabari Jews' or the Yehudan Mappila first synagogue in Cochin was destroyed in the 16th century during the Portuguese persecution of the Jews and Nasrani or Suriyani Mappila or Syriac (Aramaic) Mappila people. The second, built under the protection of the Raja, in Mattancherry, in 1558, during the Portuguese rule of Cochin, is the present synagogue, which is still in use for worship and can attract a minyan. It is called Paradesi synagogue because it was built by Spanish speaking Jews (Paradesi Jews); this contributed to the informal name: paradesi synagogue or \\"foreign\\" synagogue. In addition, a new Jewish group had immigrated to Kochi, Sephardim from the Iberian Peninsula. They and the Malabari Jews or Yehudan Mappila shared many aspects of their religion, and the newcomers learned the Judeo-Malayalam dialect, but the Sephardim also retained their own culture and Spanish language at least for three centuries. By 1660 the Dutch ruled the Kochi area, calling it Dutch Malabar. In later years, the Paradesi Synagogue was used primarily by the Sephardim (who were also referred to as Paradesi) and their descendants, and later European exiled Jews. The Paradesi Synagogue had three classes of members: *White Jews were full members. The White Jews, or Paradesi Jews, were the recent descendants of Sephardim from Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands. *Black Jews, or Malabari Jews, were allowed to worship but were not admitted to full membership. These Cochin Jews were the original Jewish settlers of Cochin. *Meshuchrarim, a group of freed slaves and their descendants brought by the Sephardim, they had no communal rights and no synagogue of their own. They sat on the floor or on the steps outside. In the first half of the 20th century, Abraham Barak Salem, a meshuchrar, successfully campaigned against this discrimination. In 1968, the 400th anniversary of the synagogue was celebrated in a ceremony attended by Indira Gandhi, the Indian Prime Minister. Present As is customary for Orthodox Jewish or Yehudan Mappila synagogues, the Paradesi Synagogue has separate seating sections for men and women. Today the Paradesi Synagogue is the only functioning synagogue in Kochi with a minyan (though this minyan must be formed with Jews from outside Kochi, as the number who still reside there is not sufficient). In conformity with the Hindu, St Thomas Christian or Syrian Mappila and Muslim Mappila traditions of Kerala, the worshippers are required to enter the Paradesi Synagogue barefoot.\\"Cochin Jews\\" , Overview Of World Religions, Philtar, St Martin's College (UK).

In addition, the current Rabbi at the Paradesi synagogue placed by Midrash Sephardi is Rabbi Yonaton Francis Goldschmidt. The synagogue is open for a fee to visitors as a historic attraction. The ticket-seller, Yaheh Hallegua, is the last female Paradesi Jew of child-bearing age. The synagogue is closed on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays and also on Jewish holidays.

There is a strict dress code for both Men and Women. Men have to wear full shirts and trousers and Women have to wear skirts below knee length . Objects of antiquity The Paradesi Synagogue has the Scrolls of the Law, several gold crowns received as gifts, many Belgian glass chandeliers, and a brass-railed pulpit. It houses the 10th-century copper plates of privileges given to Joseph Rabban, the earliest known Cochin Jew. These two plates were inscribed in Tamil by the ruler of the Malabar Coast. The floor of the synagogue is composed of hundreds of Chinese, 18th-century, hand-painted porcelain tiles, each of which is unique.

When it comes to automatically identifying and building a fuzzy system, given the high degree of nonlinearity of the output, traditional linear optimization tools have several limitations. Therefore, in the framework of soft computing, genetic algorithms (GAs) and genetic programming (GP) methods have been used successfully to identify structure and parameters of fuzzy systems. Fuzzy systems Fuzzy systems are fundamental methodologies to represent and process linguistic information, with mechanisms to deal with uncertainty and imprecision. For instance, the task of modeling a driver parking a car involves greater difficulty in writing down a concise mathematical model as the description becomes more detailed. However, the level of difficulty is not so much using simple linguistic rules, which are themselves fuzzy. With such remarkable attributes, fuzzy systems have been widely and successfully applied to control, classification and modeling problems (Mamdani, 1974) (Klir and Yuan, 1995) (Pedrycz and Gomide, 1998). Although simplistic in its design, the identification of a fuzzy system is a rather complex task that comprises the identification of (a) the input and output variables, (b) the rule base (knowledge base), (c) the membership functions and (d) the mapping parameters. Usually the rule base consists of several IF-THEN rules, linking input(s) and output(s). A simple rule of a fuzzy controller could be: IF (TEMPERATURE = HOT) THEN (COOLING = HIGH) The numerical impact/meaning of this rule depends on how the membership functions of HOT and HIGH are shaped and defined. The construction and identification of a fuzzy system can be divided into (a) the structure and (b) the parameter identification of a fuzzy system. The structure of a fuzzy system is expressed by the input and output variables and the rule base, while the parameters of a fuzzy system are the rule parameters (defining the membership functions, the aggregation operator and the implication function) and the mapping parameters related to the mapping of a crisp set to a fuzzy set, and vice versa. (Bastian, 2000). Much work has been done to develop or adapt methodologies that are capable of automatically identifying a fuzzy system from numerical data. Particularly in the framework of soft computing, significant methodologies have been proposed with the objective of building fuzzy systems by means of genetic algorithms (GAs) or genetic programming (GP). Genetic algorithms for fuzzy system identification Given the high degree of nonlinearity of the output of a fuzzy system, traditional linear optimization tools do have their limitations. Genetic algorithms have demonstrated to be a robust and very powerful tool to perform tasks such as the generation of fuzzy rule base, optimization of fuzzy rule bases, generation of membership functions, and tuning of membership functions (Cord√≥n et al., 2001a). All these tasks can be considered as optimization or search processes within large solution spaces (Bastian and Hayashi, 1995) (Yuan and Zhuang, 1996) (Cord√≥n et al., 2001b).  Genetic programming for fuzzy system identification While genetic algorithms are very powerful tools to identify the fuzzy membership functions of a pre- defined rule base, they have their limitation especially when it also comes to identify the input and output variables of a fuzzy system from a given set of data. Genetic programming has been used to identify the input variables, the rule base as well as the involved membership functions of a fuzzy model (Bastian, 2000)  Multiobjective Genetic Fuzzy Systems In the last decade multi-objective optimization of fuzzy rule based systems has attracted wide interest within the research community and practitioners. It is based on the use of stochastic algorithms for Multi-objective optimization to search for the Pareto efficiency in a multiple objectives scenario. For instance, the objectives to simultaneously optimize can be accuracy and complexity, or accuracy and interpretability. A recent review of the field is provided in the work of Fazzolari et al. (2013). In addition, [1] provides an up-to-date and continuously growing list of references on the subject.  References  1974, E.H.

The Parasnath Hill or Shikharji, located nearby, with a height of is the highest mountain in the state of Jharkhand.  Etymology  The word Parasnath comes from the 23rd Tirthankara of Jainism, Parshva. Jains refer to the Parasnath Hill as Shikharji, and it is one of the two most prominent Jain pilgrimage centers, the other being Shetrunjaya, in Gujarat. According to Jain belief, twenty of the twenty-four Tirthankaras (teachers of the Jains) attained Moksha (Nirvana) from Shikharji. History Parasnath railway station platform The Grand Chord was opened in 1906. Electrification The Gomoh-Koderma sector was electrified in 1961-62. Shikharji It is a holy place to visit with innumerable temples, shrines and meditation halls in the midst of natural scenery and wildlife. There are two recognized routes to Parasnath Hill. The summit of Parasnath Hill can be reached either from the southern or the northern side. The southern approach is from Isri Bazaar or Nimiaghat, to the top. It is motorable for about , the rest being a climb of . The northern approach is a route from Madhuban on the Dumri-Giridih road. Madhuban is about from Giridih and about from Parasnath rail station/ Isri Bazaar/ Dumri, all on Grand Trunk Road (NH 2). Buses ply along this route from Dumri to Giridih and stop at Madhuban village. Hired cars or taxis are available at Isri Bazar, just outside the rail station. There are a number of Jain temples at Madhuban. There is a metalled trek route of to the summit, a major part of which is motorable. Both the Shwetambaras and Digambaras have established Dharamshalas or Ashrams here to accommodate the pilgrims to this the first most holy place for travelers from all over the world. The main hill belongs to the Digambara. Further extension There are plans from the Railway ministry to connect Parasnath station with New Giridih Station via Madhuban, for the convenience of the Jain pilgrims visiting Shikharji. The foundation for the construction of new Parasnath-New Giridih rail line was laid in 2019. The 47-km long railway line would incur a cost of Rs 972 crore on its construction and will have two crossing stations and a couple of halts. The cost of the project would be borne by the central and the state government in 50:50 ratio and a target has been set to complete the project by 2023.

United Devices, Inc. was a privately held, commercial distributed computing company that focused on the use of grid computing to manage high-performance computing systems and enterprise cluster management. Its products and services allowed users to \\"allocate workloads to computers and devices throughout enterprises, aggregating computing power that would normally go unused.\\" It operated under the name Univa UD for a time, after merging with Univa on September 17, 2007. History Founded in 1999 in Austin, Texas, United Devices began with distributed computing expertise from distributed.net and SETI@home, although only a few of the original technical staff from those organizations remained through the years. In April 2001, grid.org was formally announced as a philanthropic non-profit website to demonstrate the benefits of Internet-based large scale grid computing. Later in 2002 with help from UD, NTT Data launched a similar Internet-based Cell Computing project targeting Japanese users. In 2004, IBM and United Devices worked together to start the World Community Grid project as another demonstration of Internet-based grid computing. In August 2005, United Devices acquired the Paris-based GridXpert company and added Synergy to its product lineup. In 2006, the company acknowledged seeing an industry shift from only using grid computing for compute-intensive applications towards data center automation and business application optimization. Partly in response to the market shifts and reorganization, grid.org was shut down on April 27, 2007 after completing its mission to \\"demonstrate the viability and benefits of large-scale Internet-based grid computing\\". On September 17, 2007, the company announced that it would merge with the Lisle, Illinois-based Univa and operate under the new name Univa UD. The combined company would offer open source solutions based around Globus Toolkit, while continuing to sell its existing grid products and support its existing customers. On June 26, 2008, United Devices client software on World Community Grid finished its role and completely relayed to BOINC's.  Commercial products  Grid MP  a job scheduler and application provisioning platform. It is offered in various editions, depending on the scalability needs of the customer. The company publishes a list of high-profile organizations using Grid MP on the United Devices website. * MP Insight  allows customers to perform data analysis to determine if their grid computing resources are being effectively used. * MP Synergy  a metascheduler based on Globus Toolkit technology that allows users to perform efficient scheduling within an organization that has multiple job schedulers already deployed and controlling independent clusters. Supported schedulers include Grid MP, Sun Grid Engine, Platform LSF, PBS, LoadLeveler, and Condor. * Reliance  designed specifically for the datacenter to provide automated infrastructure management and to ensure application service levels are honored by monitoring events and performing provisioning actions based on these events.  Public philanthropy  From 2001 until 2007, United Devices operated a series of public projects on their grid.org website as part of a philanthropic effort. It also acted as a marketing tool, helping to spread awareness of the Grid MP product and demonstrating the platform's scalability. Some of the costs associated with operating the past projects on grid.org have been financially sponsored in part by companies including Microsoft, Intel, and IBM. On April 27, 2007, United Devices closed down grid.org and the Cancer Research Project with the announcement that it \\"has completed its mission to demonstrate the viability and benefits of large-scale Internet-based grid computing.\\"  See also  Distributed computing * Grid computing * CPU scavenging * Job schedulers  References   External links  Public distributed computing projects operated by United Devices Grid computing products Cluster computing Defunct companies based in Texas American companies established in 1999 Companies disestablished in 2007 ","title":"United Devices"},{"id":"1840351","text":"In distributed computing, the bully algorithm is a method for dynamically electing a coordinator or leader from a group of distributed computer processes. The process with the highest process ID number from amongst the non-failed processes is selected as the coordinator. Assumptions The algorithm assumes that: * the system is synchronous. * processes may fail at any time, including during execution of the algorithm. * a process fails by stopping and returns from failure by restarting. * there is a failure detector which detects failed processes. * message delivery between processes is reliable. * each process knows its own process id and address, and that of every other process. Algorithm The algorithm uses the following message types: * Election Message: Sent to announce election. * Answer (Alive) Message: Responds to the Election message. * Coordinator (Victory) Message: Sent by winner of the election to announce victory. When a process recovers from failure, or the failure detector indicates that the current coordinator has failed, performs the following actions: # If has the highest process ID, it sends a Victory message to all other processes and becomes the new Coordinator. Otherwise, broadcasts an Election message to all other processes with higher process IDs than itself. # If receives no Answer after sending an Election message, then it broadcasts a Victory message to all other processes and becomes the Coordinator. # If receives an Answer from a process with a higher ID, it sends no further messages for this election and waits for a Victory message. (If there is no Victory message after a period of time, it restarts the process at the beginning.) # If receives an Election message from another process with a lower ID it sends an Answer message back and starts the election process at the beginning, by sending an Election message to higher- numbered processes. # If receives a Coordinator message, it treats the sender as the coordinator. =Analysis= Safety The safety property expected of leader election protocols is that every non-faulty process either elects a process , or elects none at all. Note that all processes that elect a leader must decide on the same process as the leader. The Bully algorithm satisfies this property (under the system model specified), and at no point in time is it possible for two processes in the group to have a conflicting view of who the leader is, except during an election. This is true because if it weren't, there are two processes and such that both sent the Coordinator (victory) message to the group. This means and must also have sent each other victory messages. But this cannot happen, since before sending the victory message, Election messages would have been exchanged between the two, and the process with a lower process ID among the two would never send out victory messages. We have a contradiction, and hence our initial assumption that there are two leaders in the system at any given time is false, and that shows that the bully algorithm is safe. Liveness Liveness is also guaranteed in the synchronous, crash-recovery model. Consider the would-be leader failing after sending an Answer (Alive) message but before sending a Coordinator (victory) message. If it does not recover before the set timeout on lower ID processes, one of them will become leader eventually (even if some of the other processes crash). If the failed process recovers in time, it simply sends a Coordinator (victory) message to all of the group. Network bandwidth utilization Assuming that the bully algorithm messages are of a fixed (known, invariant) sizes, the most number of messages are exchanged in the group when the process with the lowest ID initiates an election. This process sends (N‚àí1) Election messages, the next higher ID sends (N‚àí2) messages, and so on, resulting in \\\\Theta\\\\left(N^2\\\\right) election messages. There are also the \\\\Theta\\\\left(N^2\\\\right) Alive messages, and \\\\Theta\\\\left(N\\\\right) co-ordinator messages, thus making the overall number messages exchanged in the worst case be \\\\Theta\\\\left(N^2\\\\right).

It currently broadcasts online year round and until September 2009 also on temporary short-term FM Restricted Service Licence broadcasts. The station also hosts a large catalogue of audio for on-demand listening and podcasting, including recordings of the live stream, sessions, interviews, news and live recordings. Off-air, Subcity runs various events and club nights throughout the year, with previous venues including the Sub Club, Art School, Research Club and The Arches.  Overview  Subcity is run by volunteers and has over 200 weekly contributors from all over the city. Contributors include current students and staff of the university, students from other institutions, former students and others from the local community. Many previous contributors have gone on to jobs at commercial and BBC radio stations most notably: Laura Sayers (BBC Radio 1),Profile page on the Unofficial Scott Mills website Dougal Perman (Radio Magnetic), Annie McGuire (BBC Scotland) and Adam Uytman (XFM). In addition to those who have gone on to high-profile careers in radio, many Subcity contributors already had or went on to achieve fame in other areas most notably: Hudson Mohawke,https://www.flickr.com/photos/subcityradio/2090168652/in/set-72157603383958044/ Optimo, Boom Monk Ben, Slam (band) as well as many other Glasgow clubs and DJs. Subcity has no playlist, instead each show is largely autonomous from station management and presenters have full choice in what music they play as well as the format sound and branding of their shows. The station broadcasts all year round, and from November 2015, the show application process was changed from being a twice yearly window to being open indefinitely. Applicants are invited to submit proposals for a radio show with an outline of what music would be played and what style and format the show would take. Musical specialism, non-mainstream music and under-represented musical styles are encouraged. This contributor autonomy is extended to most areas of the station's output including podcasts, reviews, design, photography, comedy and current affairs output. It is a part of, and partially funded by, Glasgow University Students' Representative Council. It is one of four student media organisations who receive support from the SRC, who provide both a service and opportunities to students at the University and to the wider community. Subcity is also a former member of the Student Radio Association.  History  Subcity logo 1995-2001 and 2003-2012 Subcity was founded in 1995 after the initial Glasgow University radio brand, Sweet FM, was used by former members of the team who had graduated. They encountered regulatory problems during their broadcast in 1994, leaving the Sweet FM brand tarnished and in dispute with the University student authorities over naming and logo rights. Subsequently, the official university station was rebranded as Subcity Radio. The University's first broadcast was as Sweet FM in September 1993 for one month on an FM RSL from an un-let University flat in the Murano Street Student Village. The next broadcast was under the Ton and a Half brand in conjunction with the Glasgow School of Art who were celebrating their 150th anniversary in the Winter of 1994, with a subsequence joint venture with the School of Art in the winter of 1995 under the \\"Art School Radio\\" brand. 1995 *Its first broadcast under the new SubCity brand was in October 1995 from an unused University apartment in Park Circus on a minimal budget. As part of this inaugural broadcast the K Foundation gave their only radio interview about their burning of a million pounds on the SubCity show \\"Everything You Know Is Wrong\\" on 3 November 1995 at 6 pmDower, John, and Greer, Dave, \\"The K Foundation: Why we burnt a million pounds\\", Thee Data Base fanzine, 1 March 1996; based on an interview with Drummond and Cauty on Subcity Radio, Glasgow, 3 November 1995 (link 1 , link 2) 1996 *February saw the station's second broadcast as Subcity Radio . *The station was later awarded Best Station at the inaugural UK Radio 1 Student Radio Awards. *In July Subcity ran a 3-week RSL to cover that year's T in the Park festival. 1997 * In March, following the station's awards win the year before, John Peel and Steve Lamacq presented shows from the station's studio, which at the time was in a student's kitchen. * In July Subcity joined forces with Edinburgh's Fresh Air FM to provide RSLs in Edinburgh, Glasgow and on site for the T in The Park festival. 2000 *The station was able to move into a new, purpose built permanent studio on campus which allowed for year-round broadcasting and training. 2002 *In 2002, a 5-year low-powered AM licence was awarded. This allowed for permanent broadcasting to campus, rather than for just one month per year. However the AM broadcast was discontinued after 5 months due technical issues.; 2003 *The station ceased broadcasting on AM, and began streaming online. *In November, the Subcity show 'The City Sessions' won Bronze at the Student Radio Association Student Radio Awards in the Best Specialist Music category. 2004 *In February the station celebrated its tenth birthday with a large event at The Arches in Glasgow. The line up featured DJs from Subcity's past who had gone on to bigger things. 1800 people filled the venue ‚Äì the largest crowd a student station had ever attracted to an event. It was later discovered that the station's tenth birthday would be in 2005. *In November, Subcity won the Student Radio Association Student Radio Award for Best Marketing. 2005 *In July the station hosted a small stage on Byres Road at the West End Festival Opening Parade Street Party. *In November, Subcity show Grind Your Mind won the Student Radio Association Student Radio Award for Best Specialist Music Show, and the Stations won Silver in the Off-Air Promotions and Imaging category. 2007 * In June the station hosted a stage in Lilybank Gardens for the West End Festival Opening Parade Street Party. * Beginning in November, the station ran a monthly club night during term-time at the University's Hetherington Research Club.

The articles focused on a drinking game feature and the provocative language and nature of the presenters in the episode. The story was the top UK story that day on the BBC News website and made the top 5 total. * Between April and August, the station moved to temporary premises on South Park Avenue whilst the John McIntyre Building's roof was repaired. * In September 2010, the station produced a 60-page hand illustrated guide book to Glasgow, called \\"Subcity's Guide to Staying Fresh 2010\\". The station also ran an open top bus tour of the city for freshers' of the Art School and University of Glasgow. 2015 * To celebrate its 20th year on air, the station ran a number of events at The Art School including an exhibition featuring print and audio archival content, a party featuring DJs from the station's extensive throughput, and a film screening of a documentary specially made to commemorate the 20th birthday. Some controversy arose from the line up of the 20th birthday party, which initially featured exclusively male DJs. 2017 * In February, DJ and presenter (and ex- station team member) Sofay invited Ben UFO onto the station. * In May, Subcity Radio held a party at Gourock Outdoor Pool to celebrate the end of the academic year.

They are one of the leaders in the New York City death-metal scene along with fellow bands Suffocation, Mortician and Immolation, even though the band is currently located in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. To date the band has released ten full-length records, two live records, four EPs, two singles, three splits, one DVD, and three demos. Their most recent album, Sect of Vile Divinities, was released through Relapse Records in August 2020. The band have maintained a significant cult following and underground popularity since the '90s, and are considered to be highly influential on a range of later death metal bands including Dead Congregation, Grave Miasma and Portal, who are often described as 'cavernous death metal'. Incantation's music frequently draws on anti-Christian, Satanic and occult themes, and the band is notable for mixing widely varied tempos into their music, often playing slow, down-tuned passages similar to those performed by death-doom bands like Autopsy. The band has seen many lineup changes in their -year history. Guitarist/vocalist McEntee is the sole original member, though drummer Kyle Severn has appeared on every studio album since their third full- length, Diabolical Conquest. Incantation first came to prominence with Onward to Golgotha and Mortal Throne of Nazarene, both of which feature Craig Pillard on vocals. Following the release of the Forsaken Mourning of Angelic Anguish EP in 1997, Pillard departed the band and was replaced by Daniel Corchado of The Chasm. Corchado performed on one album, 1998's Diabolical Conquest, before departing. Vocalist Mike Saez performed on the next two albums, The Infernal Storm (2000) and Blasphemy (2002).

It is owned and managed by Dublin City Council. The park, the second largest municipal park in Dublin, is part of a former estate assembled by members of the Guinness family, descendants of Sir Arthur Guinness, founder of the famous brewery, beginning with Benjamin Lee Guinness in 1835 (the largest municipal park is nearby (North) Bull Island, also shared between Clontarf and Raheny). Bisected by a small river, the park features an artificial pond and a number of follies, a rose garden, a fine collection of trees with walks, a playground, cafe and recreational facilities including extensive GAA and soccer playing fields, tennis and golf. History St. Anne's Well The estate was named after the Holy Well of the same name. Lands were purchased over time to build up an extensive property, and a large Italianate-style mansion house was commissioned and modified over several generations. The Italianate influence included references in the garden follies to ancient Roman sites and the import of actual antiquities. Sir Arthur Edward Guinness (Lord Ardilaun), who inherited the estate in 1868, and purchased Manresa House next door, was the person most responsible for expanding and developing the estate and gardens and planted wind-breaking evergreen oaktrees (Quercus ilex) and pines along the main avenue and estate boundaries, where they remain. Lady Ardilaun, originally of Bantry House, County Cork, developed the gardens based on her interest in French chateau gardens, but also with eclectic influences of the Victorian era and the horticultural expertise of her Scottish gardener. Lord Ardilaun was also prominent in the Royal Horticultural Society. Lord and Lady Ardilaun had no children and the estate passed to their nephew Bishop Benjamin in the 1920s. In 1937, he decided he could no longer maintain such a large estate and negotiations with Dublin Corporation resulted in the house and of estate being sold to the Corporation for approximately ¬£55,000 in 1939. Bishop Plunkett retained Sybil Hill as a private residence with 30 acres (120,000 m¬≤) of parkland, and it was later sold to the later became the site of St Paul's College, Raheny. In 1952 St. Paul's College acquired an additional 14 acres of Corporation lands, behind their school, to use as school playing fields. During the second World War, Dublin Corporation encouraged local residents to grow vegetables in allotment gardens in the estate. In December 1943, the main residence of St Anne's, \\"The Mansion,\\" was gutted by a fire while being used as a store by the Local Defence Force; the ruins were demolished in 1968. In the meantime, just over of the estate were developed for public housing with the central and most attractive portion comprising about retained as parkland and playing fields. Features Chestnut walk from rock garden to duck pond The park has a number of features. It is crossed by the small Naniken River, and this in turn feeds the artificial Duck Pond. The Guinness family added a number of follies, a walled garden, and the grand avenue. Over the last fifty years, extensive walks, a famous Rose Garden and newer miniature rose garden, and Dublin's city arboretum, the Millennium Arboretum, with 1,000 varied trees, have been added. Within the last decade, Dublin City Council has been restoring parts of the Naniken River to its natural state, creating wildlife habitats and wildflower meadows, and improving the path system. They removed some 1970s interventions, including a secondary pond and some rockery walks, partly due to problems with maintenance and partly to open up a vista from the James Larkin Road. The park management also increased car parking to alleviate traffic congestion in the surrounding neighbourhoods of the popular park. =Follies= St. Annes is known for its follies, of which there are approximately ten, mainly around the Naniken River. The follies include a Herculanean Temple on a mock-ruined bridge abutment along the little river, which served as a tearoom for the family, a Pompeian Water Temple of Isis on the banks of the duck pond, and the Annie Lee Tower and Bridge near the chestnut walk. Other follies include the stone covering of Saint Anne's Well beside the duck pond, the Hermitage Bridge, the Yew Circle and Fountain Pool (behind the formal walled garden beside the house), a \\"rustic cave\\" and bridge, three rustic archways and a rockwork feature. A \\"Druidic Circle\\" of Giant's Causeway basalt was lost at an earlier stage. An unusual folly is the Roman style viewing tower which stands on the hill overlooking the duckpond. This started out as an observation tower on the roof of the original house.Ussher Sharkey, Joan, St. Annes: the Story of a Guinness Estate, pp 14,47, Dublin, 2002, Later, the tower was removed during extensive refurbishment of St. Annes' house in about 1873 and placed in its current location. It is modelled on the Tomb of the Julii at Glanum near St. R√©my in France. Many of the follies are in a neglected condition at present, with graffiti being an ongoing particular issue. For example, the Roman style viewing tower is graffiti-covered, has been closed for many years and is completely hidden by mature trees (it could only be revealed, and the view restored, by felling trees, which would be detrimental to the environment of the park, so an alternative proposal is that the tower be moved instead to the site of the old rockery, near the junction of James Larkin Road and Mount Prospect Avenue). In 2010, Dublin City Council, with the support of the Heritage Council, commissioned a strategy by conservation architects (Shaffrey and Associates) for the long-term conservation of these follies, and it is planned to implement this on a phased basis.Lee McCullough report for Shaffrey Architects on St. Annes folly project File:Clontarf Park Gates.tifAnnie Lee Tower and Bridge Folly near chestnut walk File:Temple of Isis St Annes Park Dublin.JPGTemple of Isis by duck pond File:St Anne's Park is the second largest municipal park in Dublin - panoramio (22).jpgHerculanean temple overlooking the Naniken River File:Roman Tower St Annes Park Dublin.JPGRoman style tower on hill above duck pond File:St Anne's Park is the second largest municipal park in Dublin - panoramio (6).jpgRustic archway =Buildings= The red stables on market day The elaborate Tudor red brick Ardilaun stables were designed by George Coppinger Ashlin, also architect of All Saints Church at Raheny. The Red Stables as they are called, were renovated in the 1990s by Dublin City Council as the Red Stables Art Centre, with public facilities such as artists' residences upstairs, an exhibition space and a caf√©, Olive's Room. Previous artists-in-residence include Niall de Buitl√©ar, Tadhg McSweeney, and Paul McKinley. A Farmers' Market is held in the courtyard at weekends. This scheme has won international architecture awards. =Gardens= The walled garden, including a fruit garden added to the estate by Bishop Plunkett, holds a plant nursery for the Parks Department. Thousands of bedding plants, shrubs, trees, and floral tubs are produced annually in the nursery. There is a herbaceous garden area open during limited hours, and a fine clock tower, restored to working order in 2007. Since 2009, Dublin City Council has provided public allotment gardens (allocated on a lottery basis) to meet the demand by city residents for space to grow their own produce. The walled garden next to the house also contained many features, of which few traces remain.Malins, Edward & Bowe, Patrick, Irish Gardens and Demesnes from 1830, pp 47 ‚Äì 50, London, 1980, The garden was entered through a claire-voie screen of bronze, painted yew green and elaborately gilded. The centre walk of the garden consisted of a castellated yew hedge with marble statuary along its length. The walk terminated in a nymphaeum, flanked by obelisks of yew and featuring a sculpted group of Jupiter and Thetis. Also in the walled house garden was an aviary with golden pheasants; a floral temple of arches and chains in cast iron; and a circular yew hedge with allegorical marble Italian statues representing the five continents, which were reflected in a great circular marble basin in the centre. The Georgian door-case of the original house Thornhill was also erected as an entrance of a French lavender garden. In 1975, St Anne's Rose Garden was opened to the public. In 1980 it was given a Civic Award by Bord Failte and the Irish Town Planning Institute, and since 1981 it has been a centre for International Rose Trials. Its development led to the annual Rose Festival, now a popular event on the summer calendar for Dublin gardeners and families every July.

Woodland paths provide for walkers and joggers. There is a weekly free 5 km parkrun on Saturday mornings at 9:30 in the park. There is an all weather cricket crease in the middle of the main playing fields, and one pitch is floodlit for Gaelic Games. North Dublin Softball Club also use the park for training. There are 4 Boules (p√©tanque) courts, and a model car racing track. Fauna Mammals present in the park include badgers, hedgehogs, rabbits, fox, grey squirrels, house mice, field mice, pipistrelle bats and brown rats. Birds include sparrow hawk, woodcock and jay. The park has a greater than average diversity of bee species and is also notable for many species of butterflies. =Squirrels= A grey squirrel in the park Red squirrels were formerly numerous in the park, which was one of the last strongholds of the species in Dublin. Grey squirrels were first noticed at the Sybil Hill end of the park in 1998. The grey squirrels have since spread throughout the park and numbers of reds have been drastically reduced. A programme to reduce grey squirrels was carried out by Dublin City Council and University College Dublin, but the remaining red squirrel population was not reproducing and has crashed, for reasons uncertain. It is hoped that a re-introduction programme will be possible in future. Flora The park has a range of vegetation habitats and many historic trees. The plant collections are of national importance. There are also protected native plants and species of botanical interest. These are surveyed and managed by Dublin City Council Parks and Landscape Services Division.

Some of his work consisted of translations of older work, in particular the 1st century BC Roman poet Catullus's \\"A Lesbia\\" as \\"Dame amor, besos sin cuento\\" (Seen side-by-side in ). Life At fifteen he was taken to the Court of Ferdinand the Catholic, where he served as a page to Archduke Ferdinand of Habsburg, grandson of the king and the younger brother of Emperor Charles V. In this period he entered the Cistercian convent of San Martin de Valdeiglesias. In 1525, he left his retirement to take over the secretariat of its former master, who in 1526 became king of Hungary, the year after King of Bohemia, and who in 1531 would accede to the German crown with the title of King of the Romans as imperial lieutenant of his brother. He traveled throughout Europe. In Vienna, though a monk, he led a dissolute life and had an affair and an illegitimate child. He fell on hard times because he wasted all the benefits and privileges that their positions gave him. He fell in love with a young German lady, Anne of Schaumburg, who left him for a Bohemian noble, but apparently also went after that Anne of Aragon after he lost hope of ever returning to Spain, evoking a famous account romance: Disillusioned, he retired to a convent in Vienna, where he died.

He was born in Edessa (in today's southeastern Turkey) and became the bishop of Emesa (in today's Syria). The Latin form of his name is Eusebius Emesenus. After receiving his early education in his native town, he studied theology at Caesarea in Palestine and Antioch, and philosophy and science at Alexandria. Among his teachers were Eusebius of Caesarea and Patrophilus of Scythopolis. The reputation he acquired for learning and eloquence led to his being offered the see of Alexandria in succession to the deposed Athanasius at the beginning of 339, but he declined, and the council of Antioch chose Gregory of Cappadocia, \\"a fitter agent for the rough work to be done.\\" Eusebius accepted the small bishopric of Emesa (the modern Homs), but his powers as mathematician and astronomer led his flock to accuse him of practising sorcery, and he had to flee to Laodicea (the modern Latakia). A reconciliation was effected by the patriarch of Antioch, but tradition says that Eusebius finally resigned his charge and lived a studious life in Antioch. His fame as an astrologer commended him to the notice of the Roman emperor Constantius II, with whom he became a great favourite, accompanying him on many of his expeditions. The theological sympathies of Eusebius were with the semi-Arian party, but his interest in the controversy was not strong. His life was written by his friend George of Laodicea. He was a man of extraordinary learning, great eloquence and considerable intellectual power, but of his numerous writings only a few fragments are now in existence. A considerable number of his sermons are extant, although they have not always been recognised as his work. Butyaert discovered a manuscript at Troyes in 1914 containing a Latin translation of some sermons. A collection also exists in Armenian, combined with some sermons of Severian of Gabala.

Arising in the early 1990s, the image of the \\"lad\\"‚Äîor \\"new lad\\"‚Äîwas that of a generally middle class figure espousing attitudes typically attributed to the working classes. The subculture involves young men assuming an anti-intellectual position, shunning sensitivity in favour of drinking, violence and sexism.Dr Joanne Knowles in Kristina Nelson's Narcissism in High Fidelity (2004) p. 19 Origins The term \\"new lad\\" was coined by journalist Sean O'Hagan in a 1993 article in Arena. pdf version Gender Institute, London School of Economics. Part of \\"the postmodern transformation of masculinity ... the 1990s 'new lad' was a clear reaction to the 'new man' ... most clearly embodied in current men's magazines, such as Maxim, FHM and Loaded, and marked by a return to hegemonic masculine values of male homosociality\\".Nylund, p. 9 At a time when \\"men saw themselves as battered by feminism\\", one could also consider that \\"laddishness is a response to humiliation and indignity ... the girl-power! girl-power! female triumphalism which echoes through the land\\".Weldon, p. 61 Lad culture grew beyond men's magazines to movies such as Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and to the TV sitcom Men Behaving Badly. Bottom, Al Murray's Happy Hour and They Think It's All Over are television programmes that present images of laddishness that are dominated by the male pastimes of drinking, watching football, and sex. These are presented as being ironic and \\"knowing\\" (the masthead of Loaded is \\"for men who should know better\\"). Postfeminism The rise of the new lad coincided with a backlash against feminism by both men and women, and in particular against the figure of the new man as \\"one who has subjugated his masculinity in order to fulfill the needs of women ... this passive and insipid image\\".Knowles, Joanne Nick Hornby's High Fidelity (2002) pp. 16, 39 At a time when \\"the stereotypes for men attentive to feminism were two: Eunuch, or Beast\\",‚Äîand when women were increasingly feeling that \\"new men are fine in the kitchen, but who wants them in the bedroom?\\"Weldon, p. 69‚Äîthe \\"new lad\\" image offered \\"a space of fun, consumption and sexual freedom for men\\", as well as \\"a refuge from the constraints and demands of marriage and nuclear family\\".Genz, p. 142 Contrasting the two gender constructs, Tim Edwards, a sociologist at the University of Leicester, describes the new man as pro-feminist, albeit narcissistic, and the new lad as pre-feminist, and a reaction to second-wave feminism. The new man image failed to appeal to a wide readership whereas the more adolescent Lad culture appeals more to the ordinary man, says Edwards. Social constraints also meant that \\"it is easier to be a lad rather than a new man in most workplaces\\".Samantha Holland, Alternative Femininities (2004) p. 29 However, Edwards also points out that lad culture men's magazines of the 21st century contain little that is actually new. Noting a study of the history of Esquire, he observes that there is little substantially different between the new man Arena and GQ and the new lad Loaded et al. Both address assumed men's interests of cars, alcohol, sport, and women, and differ largely in that the latter have a more visual style. From this he infers that \\"the New Man and the New Lad are niches in the market more than anything else, often defined according to an array of lifestyle accessories\\", and concludes that the new lad image dominates the new man image simply because of its greater success at garnering advertising revenue for men's magazines. Criticism Lad culture has attracted criticism from feminist circles. For example, Germaine Greer critiques it in her 2000 book The Whole Woman; while Kira Cochrane asserts that \\"it's a dark world that Loaded and the lad culture has bequeathed us\\".Kira Cochrane, \\"The dark world of lads' mags\\". Newstatesman.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-16. Joanne Knowles of Liverpool John Moores University wrote that the \\"lad\\" displays \\"a pre-feminist and racist attitude to women as both sex objects and creatures from another species\\". A study by Gabrielle Ivinson of Cardiff University and Patricia Murphy of the Open University identified lad culture as a source of behavioural confusion, and an investigation by Adrienne Katz linked it to suicide and depression. A study of the architecture profession found that lad culture had a negative impact on women completing their professional education. Commentator Helen Wilkinson believes that lad culture has affected politics and decreased the ability of women to participate. The UK's largest student union warned in a 2015 study that universities were failing to address the issue of lad culture, with almost half (49%) of all universities having no policy against discrimination due to sexuality, or anti-sexual harassment policies. Ladette The word \\"ladette\\" has been coined to describe young women who take part in laddish behaviour. Ladettes are defined by the Concise Oxford Dictionary as: \\"Young women who behave in a boisterously assertive or crude manner and engage in heavy drinking sessions.\\" Other locations The term \\"lad\\" is also used in Australian youth culture to refer to the Eshay subculture which is more similar to the chav or football casual subcultures, rather than the middle class student subculture the term refers to in the United Kingdom. Australian lads wear a distinctive dress code, consisting of running caps and shoes combined with striped polo shirts and sports shorts. They frequently use pig latin phrases in conversation, for example \\"Ad-lay\\" to refer to a fellow \\"Lad\\". Lad-rap is a growing underground hip hop scene in Australia. It is also sometimes used in Canada to refer to (primarily) university-aged men and young adults in a similar fashion to the British usage, with an emphasis on beer drinking. There are many similarities with the American bro culture, which often celebrates binge drinking, sex, and may be associated with membership in college fraternities.

Social grooming is a behavior in which social animals, including humans, clean or maintain one another's body or appearance. A related term, allogrooming, indicates social grooming between members of the same species. Grooming is a major social activity, and a means by which animals who live in close proximity may bond and reinforce social structures, family links, and build companionships. Social grooming is also used as a means of conflict resolution, maternal behavior and reconciliation in some species. Mutual grooming typically describes the act of grooming between two individuals, often as a part of social grooming, pair bonding, or a precoital activity.  Evolutionary advantages  There are a variety of proposed mechanisms by which social grooming behavior has been hypothesized to increase fitness. These evolutionary advantages may come in the form of health benefits including reduced disease transmission and reduced stress levels, maintaining social structure, and direct improvement of fitness as a measure of survival. = Health benefits = It is often argued as to whether the overarching importance of social grooming is to boost an organism's health and hygiene or whether the social side of social grooming plays an equally or more important role. Traditionally, it is thought that the primary function of social grooming is the upkeep of an animal's hygiene. Evidence to support this statement involves the fact that allogrooming concentrates on body parts that are inaccessible by autogrooming and that the amount of time spent allogrooming regions did not vary significantly even if the body part had a more important social or communicatory function. Social grooming behaviour has been shown to elicit an array of health benefits in a variety of species. For example, group member connection has the potential to mitigate the potentially harmful effects of stressors. In macaques, social grooming has been proven to reduce heart rate. Social affiliation during a mild stressor was shown to correlate with lower levels of mammary tumor development and longer lifespan in rats, while lack of this affiliation was demonstrated to be a major risk factor. Grooming has also been shown to play an integral role in reducing tick load in wild baboons (Papio cynocephalus). These ectoparasitic ticks carry the potential to act as vectors for the spreading of disease and infection by common tick-borne parasites such as haemoprotozoan. Baboons with lower tick loads show decreased occurrence of such infections and display signs of greater health status, evidenced by higher hematocrit (packed red cell volume) levels. Baboons allogrooming for ticks On the other hand, it could be argued that the hygienic aspect to allogrooming does not play an as important role as the social aspect to it. Observational studies performed on 44 different primate species suggest that the number of times a species allogrooms, on average, correlates with its group size rather than with its body size. If allogrooming was purely required from a hygienic standpoint, then the larger an animal, the more and more often it would be groomed by members of its group. However, we see instead that when group size increases, members ensure that they spend an appropriate amount of time grooming everyone. Hence, the fact that animals, particularly primates here, groom each other more frequently than necessary from a hygienic standpoint suggests that the social angle of allogrooming plays an equally, if not more, important role. Another point of evidence for the importance of the social aspect is that in comparison to how much and how a primate grooms itself (autogrooming), allogrooming involved longer periods of time and different techniques, some of which have connotations of being affectionate gestures. =Reinforcing social structure and building relationships=  Creation and maintenance of social bonds  One of the most critical functions of social grooming is to establish social networks and relationships. In many species, individuals form close social connections dubbed \\"friendships\\" due to long durations spent together doing activities. In primates especially, grooming is known to have major social significance and function in the formation and maintenance of these friendships. Studies performed on rhesus monkeys showed that fMRI scans of the monkeys' brains lit up more significantly at the perirhinial cortex (associated with recognition and memory) and the temporal pole (associated with social and emotional processing/analysis) when the monkeys were shown pictures of their friends' faces as compared to less familiar faces. Hence, primates recognize familiar and well-liked individuals ('friends') and spend more time grooming them as compared to less favoured partners. In species with a more tolerant social style, such as Barbary macaques, it is seen that females choose their grooming mates based on whom they know better rather than on social rank. In addition to primates, animals such as deer, cows, horses, vole, mice, meerkats, coati, lions, birds, bats also form social bonds through grooming behaviour. Indian short-nosed fruit bats in a tight-knit cluster Social grooming may also serve to establish and recognize mates or amorous partners. For example, in short-nosed fruit bats, the females initiate grooming with the males just before flight at dusk. The male and his close- knit female harem apply bodily secretions on each other, which could possibly allow them to recognize the female's reproductive status. The 2016 study by Kumar et al. chemically analyzed these secretions, revealing that they may be required in chemosensory mediated communication and mate choice. Similarly, in the less aggressive herb-field mice species, males are observed to groom females for longer durations and even allow females to not reciprocate. Since the mating demands of males are greater than those of offered by females, the females use social grooming as a method to choose mates and males use it to incite mating. Finally, kin selection is not as important a factor as friendship or mate preference when choosing a grooming mate as previously thought. In the 2018 Phelps et al. captive study on chimpanzees, it was seen that the animals remembered interactions that were 'successful' or 'unsuccessful' and used that as a basis to choose grooming mates; they chose grooming mates based on who would reciprocate rather than who would not. More importantly, if the delay between two chimpanzees grooming each other is very little, then the chimpanzees tend to 'time match', i.e. the second groomer grooms the first for the same amount of time that he/she was groomed. This 'episodic memory' requires a demanding amount of cognitive function and emotional recognition, and has been tested experimentally with respect to food preferences, where apes chose between tasty perishable and non-tasty non- perishable food at shorter and longer delays respectively after trying the food. Hence, apes can distinguish between different events that occurred at different times.  Enforcing hierarchy and social structure  In general, social grooming is an activity that is directed up hierarchy, i.e. a lower ranking individual grooms a higher ranking individual in the group. In meerkats, social grooming has been shown to carry the role of maintaining relationships that increase fitness. In this system, researchers have observed that dominant males receive more grooming while grooming others less, thereby indicating that less dominant males groom more dominant individuals to maintain relationships. In a study conducted on rhesus monkeys, it was seen that more dominant group members were 'stroked' more than they were 'picked at' when getting groomed, as compared to lower ranking group members. From a utilitarian standpoint, stroking is a less effective technique for grooming than picking, but it is construed as being a more affectionate gesture. Hence, grooming a higher ranking individual could be conducted in order to placate a potential aggressor and reduce tension. Moreover, individuals closer in rank tend to groom each other reciprocally than individuals further apart in rank. Grooming networks in black crested gibbons have been proven to contribute greater social cohesion and stability. Groups of gibbons with more stable social networks formed grooming networks that were significantly more complex, while groups with low stability networks formed far fewer grooming pairs.  Interchange of favours  Grooming is often offered by an individual in exchange for a certain behavioural response or action. Social grooming is critical for vampire bats especially, since it is necessary for them to maintain food-sharing relationships in order to sustain their food regurgitation sharing behaviour. In Tibetan macaques, infants are seen as a valuable commodity that can be exchanged for favours; mothers allow non- mothers to handle their infants for short durations in exchange for being groomed. Tibetan macaques measure and perceive the value of the infants by noting the relative ratio of infants in the group; as the number of infants increase, their 'value' decreases and the amount of grooming in exchange for infant-handling performed by non-mothers for mothers decreases. In male bonobos, it is suggested that grooming is exchanged in favour of some emotional component because grooming familiar individuals involves larger time differences (i.e. the duration for which each individual grooms the other is not equal) and reduced reciprocity (i.e. likelihood of grooming the other is unpredictable). Hence, the presence of some sort of social bond between individuals results in greater 'generosity' and tolerance between them. = Direct fitness consequences = Social grooming relationships have been proven to provide direct fitness benefits to a variety of species. In particular, grooming in yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus) has been studied extensively, with numerous studies showing an increase in fitness as a result of social bonds formed through social grooming behavior. One such study, which collected 16 years of behavioral data on wild baboons, highlights the effects that sociality has on infant survival. A positive relationship is established between infant survival to one year and a composite sociality index, a measure of sociality based on proximity and social grooming. Evidence has also been provided for the effect of sociality on adult survival in wild baboons. Direct correlations between measures of social connectedness (which focuses on social grooming) and median survival time for both female and male baboons were modeled. The relationship between median survival time and social connectedness in female baboons Social bonds established by grooming may provide an adaptive advantage in the form of conflict resolution and protection from aggression. In wild savannah baboons, social affiliations are shown to augment fitness by increasing tolerance from more dominant group members and increasing the chance of obtaining aid from conspecifics during instances of within-group contest interactions. In the yellow baboon, adult females form relationships with their kin, who offer support during times of violent conflict within social groups. In Barbary macaques, social grooming results in the formation of crucial relationships among partners. These social relationships serve to aid cooperation and facilitate protection against combative groups composed of other males, which can oftentimes cause physical harm. Furthermore, social relationships have also been proven to decrease risk of infanticide in several primates.  Altruism  Altruism, in the biological sense, refers to a behavior performed by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the one performing the behavior. This differs from the philosophical concept of altruism which requires the conscious intention of helping another. As a behavior, altruism is not evaluated in moral terms, but rather as a consequence of an action for reproductive fitness. It is often questioned why the behavior persists if it is costly to the one performing it, however, Charles Darwin proposed group selection as the mechanism behind the clear advantages of altruism. Social grooming is considered a behavior of facultative altruism- the behavior itself is a temporary loss of direct fitness (with potential for indirect fitness gain), followed by personal reproduction. This tradeoff has been compared to the Prisoner's Dilemma model, and out of this comparison came Robert Trivers reciprocal altruism theory under the title \\"tit-for-tat\\". In conjunction with altruism, kin selection bears an emphasis on favoring the reproductive success of an organism's relatives, even at a cost to the organism's own survival and reproduction. Because of this, kin selection is an instance of inclusive fitness, which combines the number of offspring produced with the number an individual can ensure the production of by supporting others, such as siblings. = Hamilton's rule = rB>C Developed by W.D. Hamilton, this rule governs the idea that kin selection causes genes to increase in frequency when the genetic relatedness (r) of a recipient to an actor multiplied by the benefit to the recipient (B) is greater than the reproductive cost to the actor (C). Thus, it is advantageous for an individual to partake in altruistic behaviors, such as social grooming, so long as the individual receiving the benefits of the behavior is related to the one providing the behavior. = Use as a commodity = It was questioned whether some animals are instead using altruistic behaviors as a market strategy to trade for something desirable. In olive baboons, Papio anubis, it has been found that individuals perform altruistic behaviors as a form of trade in which a behavior is provided in exchange for benefits, such as reduced aggression. The grooming was evenly balanced across multiple bouts rather than single bouts, suggesting that females are not constrained to complete exchanges with single transactions and use social grooming to solidify long term relationships with those in their social group. In addition, white-handed gibbons (Hylobates lar) confirmed that males were more attentive to social grooming during estrus of the females in their group. Though the behavior of social grooming itself was not beneficial to the one providing the service, the opportunity to mate and subsequent fertilization increases the reproductive fitness of those participating in the behavior. This study was also successful in finding that social grooming performance cycled with that of the females ovarian cycle.  Ontogeny of social grooming  = General learning and reciprocation of allogrooming = In most cases, allogrooming is an action that is learned from an individual's mother. Infants are groomed by their mothers and mimic these actions on each other and the mother as juveniles. This action is reciprocated on other group members (non- mother or of a different rank) more often once the individual is a fully developed adult and can follow normal grooming patterns. = Sex based differences in learning = Male and female members of a species may differ in learning how, when and whom to groom. In stump-tailed macaques, infant females mimic their mothers' actions by grooming their mothers more often than their males counterparts do and by grooming the same group members that their mothers groom. This mimicry is suggested to indicate identification-based observational learning in infant stump-tailed macaques, and the daughters' penchants for maternal mimicry and kin-biased grooming versus the sons' penchants for rank-biased grooming falls in line with their social roles in groups, where adult males require alliances in order to gain and maintain rank.  Tool usage  In nearly all instances of social grooming, individuals use their own body parts, such as hands, teeth or tongue, to groom a group member or infant. It is very rare to observe instances of tool usage in social grooming in non-human animals; however, a few such instances have been observed in primates. In a 1981 observational study of Japanese macaques at Bucknell University, a mother macaque was seen to choose a stone after observing several stones on the ground and then use this stone to groom her infant. It was hypothesized that the stone was used as a distractor for the infant so that the mother could adequately clean her infant while his attention was occupied elsewhere. This was supported by the fact that the infant picked up the stone once the mother dropped it and allowed her to groom him while he played with it. This action was seen in a few other members in the colony, but was not seen throughout the species at all. At another instance, a female chimpanzee at the Delta Regional Primate Research Center created a 'toothbrush' by stripping a twig of its leaves and used this toothbrush to groom her infant over several instances. However, both examples concern tool use in primates, which is already widely studied and scientifically backed. The wide working memory capacities and causal understanding capabilities of primates permit them to fashion and utilize tools far more extensively than other non-human animals. Apart from physical and mental constraints, perhaps a reason allogrooming animals do not use tools is because a major purpose of social grooming is social bonding and involves emotional exchanges, much of which is conveyed by touch.

This activity often serves to remove foreign material from the body to promote the communal success of these socially active animals. There exists a wide array of socially grooming animals throughout the kingdom, including primates, insects, birds, and bats. While thorough research has still yet to be engaged, much has been learned about social grooming in non-human animals via the study of primates. The driving force behind mammal social grooming is primarily believed to be rooted in adaptation to consolatory behavior as well as utilitarian purposes in the exchange of resources such as food, sex, and communal hygiene.thumb = Insects = In insects, grooming often involves the important role of removing foreign material from the body. The honey bee, for example, engages in social grooming by cleaning body parts that cannot be reached by the receiving bee. The receiving bee extends their wings perpendicular to their body while their wings, mouth parts, and antennae are cleaned in order to remove dust and pollen. This removal of dust and pollen allows for sharpening of olfactory senses in contributing to the overall well being of the group. = Bats = thumb Recent studies have determined that vampire bats engage in social grooming much more than other types of bats to promote the well-being of the group. Facing higher levels of parasitic infection, vampire bats engage in cleaning one another as well as sharing food via regurgitation. This activity prevents ongoing infection while also promoting group success. = Primates = Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) grooming each other at the Jigokudani Monkey Park in Yamanouchi Primates provide perhaps one of the best examples of mutual grooming due to the intensive research performed regarding their varying lifestyles, and the direct variation of means of social grooming across different species. Among primates, social grooming plays a significant role in animal consolation behavior whereby the primates engage in establishing and maintaining alliances through dominance hierarchies, pre- existing coalitions, and for reconciliation after conflicts. Primates groom socially in moments of boredom as well, and the act has been shown to reduce tension and stress. This reduction in stress is often associated with observed periods of relaxed behavior, and primates have been known to fall asleep while receiving grooming. Conflict among primates has been observed by researchers as increasing stress among the group, making mutual grooming very advantageous. There are benefits to initiating grooming. The one that starts the grooming will in return be groomed themselves, getting the benefit of being cleaned. Research has found that primates that are lower on the social ladder may initiate grooming with a higher ranked primate in order to increase their position. Under times of higher conflict and competition, it has been found that this is less likely to occur. Researchers have suggested that primates may see a need to balance the uses of grooming, swapping between its use a means to increase social standing and the use of grooming to keep oneself clean. Grooming in primates is not only utilized for alliance formation and maintenance, but to exchange resources such as communal food, sex, and hygiene. Wild baboons have been found to utilize social grooming as an activity to remove ticks and other insects from others. In this grooming, the body areas receiving significant attention appear to be the regions where the baboons themselves cannot reach. Grooming activity in these regions is used to remove parasites, dirt, dead skin, as well as tangled fur to help keep the animal's health in good condition despite an individual inability to reach and clean certain areas. Time primates spend grooming increases with group size, but too large of group sizes can lead to decreased group cohesion because time spent grooming is usually impacted by other factors. Consequently, some of these aspects that affect time spent grooming include ecological, phylogenetic, and life history. For example, the article states, \\"Cognitive constraints and predation pressure strongly affect group sizes and thereby have an indirect effect on primate grooming time\\". By analyzing past data and studies done about this topic, the authors found that a primate group greater than 40 will face greater ecological problems and, thus, time spent during social grooming is affected. Recent studies regarding chimpanzees have determined the direct correlation of the release of oxytocin to consolatory behavior. This behavior as well as release has been noted in primates such as the Vervet monkey, a primate species that actively engages in social grooming from early childhood to adulthood. Vervet monkey siblings often have conflict over grooming allocation by their mother, yet, grooming remains an activity that mediates tension and is low cost for alliance formation and maintenance. This grooming occurs both between the siblings as well as involving the mother. Recent studies regarding the crab-eating macaques have shown that males will groom females in order to procure sex. One study found that a female has a greater likelihood to engage in sexual activity with a male if he had recently groomed her, compared to males who had not groomed her.[41] = Birds = Birds engage in allopreening. Researchers believe that this practice builds pair bonds. In 2010, researchers determined the existence of a form of social grooming as a consolation behavior within ravens via a form of bystander contact, whereby observer ravens would act to console a distressed victim via contact sitting, preening, as well as beak-to-beak touching. = Horses = Horses engage in mutual grooming via the formation of 'pair bonds' where parasites and other contaminants on the surface of the body are actively removed. This removal of foreign material is primarily performed in hard-to- reach areas such as the neck via nibbling.Feh, C., De Mazieres, J. Grooming at a preferred site reduces heart rate in horses. Anim. Behav. 1993;46:1191‚Äì1194. =Cattle= Allogrooming is a behavior commonly seen in many types of cattle, including dairy and beef breeds. The act of social licking can be seen specifically in heifers to initiate social dominance, emphasize companionship and improve hygiene of oneself or others. This behavior seen in cows may provide advantages including reduced parasite loads, social tension and competition at the feed bunk. It is understood that social licking can provide long term benefits such as promoting positive emotions and a relaxed environment. Endocrine effects Social grooming has shown to be correlated with changes in endocrine levels within individuals. Specifically, there is a large correlation between the brain's release of oxytocin and social grooming. Oxytocin is hypothesized to promote prosocial behaviors due to its positive emotional response when released. Further, social grooming also releases beta- endorphins which promote physiological responses in stress reduction. These responses can occur from the production of hormones and endorphins, or through the growth or reduction in nerve structures. For example, in studies of suckling rats, rats who received warmth and touch when feeding had lower blood pressure levels than rats who did not receive any touch. This was found to be a result of an increased vagal nerve tone, meaning they had had higher parasympathetic nervous response and lower sympathetic nervous response to stimulus, resulting in a lower stress response. Social grooming is a form of innocuous sensory activation. Innocuous sensory activation, characterized by non-aggressive contact, stimulates an entirely separate neural pathway from nocuous aggressive sensory activation. Innocuous sensations are transmitted through the dorsal column-medial lemniscal system. = Oxytocin = Oxytocin is a peptide hormone known to help express social emotions such as altruism, which in turn provides a positive feedback mechanism for social behaviors. For example, studies in vampire bats have shown that intranasal injections of oxytocin have increased the amount of allogrooming done by female bats. The release of oxytocin, found to be stimulated by positive touch (such as allogrooming), positive smells and sounds, can have physiological benefits to the individual. Benefits can include: relaxation, healing, and digestion stimulation. Further, reproductive benefits have been found such as studies in rats have shown that the release of oxytocin can increase male reproductive success. The role of oxytocin is important in maternal pair bonding, and is hypothesized to promote similar bonding in social groups as a result of positive feedback loops from social interactions. = Beta-endorphins = Grooming stimulates the release of beta-endorphin, which is one physiological reason for why grooming appears to be relaxing. Beta-endorphins are found in neurons in the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. Beta-endorphins are found to be opioid agonists. Opioids are molecules that act on receptors to promote feelings of relaxation, and reduce pain. A study in monkeys shows the changes in opiate expression in the body, mirroring changes in beta-endorphin levels, influences desire for social grooming. In using opiate receptor blockades, which decrease the level of beta-endorphins, the monkeys responded with an increased desire to be groomed. In contrast, when the monkeys were given morphine, the desire to be groomed dropped significantly. Beta- endorphins have been difficult to measure in animal species, differently from oxytocin which can be measured by sampling cerebrospinal fluid, and therefore have not been linked as strongly with social behaviors. = Glucocorticoids receptors = Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones that are synthesized in the adrenal cortex and are a part of the group of corticosteroids. Glucocorticoids are involved in immune function, and are a part of the feedback system that reduces inflammation. Further, glucocorticoids are involved in glucose metabolism. Studies in macaques have shown that increased social stress results in glucocorticoid resistance, further inhibiting immune function. Macaques who participated in social grooming showed decreased levels of viral load, which points toward decreased levels of social stress resulting in increased immune function and glucocorticoid sensitivity. Additionally, an article published in 1997 concluded that an increase in maternal grooming resulted in a proportionate increase in Glucocorticoid receptors on target tissue in the neonatal rat. In the study on neonatal rats, it was found that the receptor number was altered because of a change in both serotonin and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations. An increase in the number of receptors might influence the amount of negative feedback on corticosteroid secretion and prevent the undesirable side effects of an abnormal physiologic stress response. Social grooming can change the number of glucocorticoid receptors, which can result in increased immune function. Studies have also shown that male baboons who participate more in social grooming show lower basal cortisol concentrations. Faecal glucocorticoid (fGCs) is a hormone metabolite associated with stress that is seen to be present in lower levels in female baboons with stronger, well-established grooming networks. When potentially infanticidal male baboons immigrate into a group, the females' fGC levels are seen to rise, indicative of higher stress; however, females with reliable and well-established grooming partners have less of a fGC rise than those with weaker grooming networks. Hence, the social support received from a 'friendship' aids baboons in stress management. Similarly, fGC levels are also seen to rise in females when a close 'friend' dies; however, these rising fGC levels are seen to decrease in females that form new grooming partners, replacing their deceased friends. = Opioids = Endogenous opioids are chemical molecules produced in the brains of organisms and serve to create feelings of relaxation, happiness and pain relief. In primates, laughter and social grooming trigger opioid release in the brain, which is thought to form and maintain social bonds. In a study performed on rhesus monkeys, lactating females with 4-10-week old infants were given low doses of naloxone, an opioid antagonist that blocks the opioid receptor and inhibits the effects of endogenous opioids. In comparison to the control females, who were given saline solutions, the naloxone females groomed their infants and other members of their group less. The naloxone females were also observed to be less protective of their young, which is uncharacteristic of new mothers. This decline in social interactions upon naloxone injection suggests that opioid antagonists interfere with maternal involvement in social actions - here, social grooming. We could hypothesize therefore that higher levels of opioids in new rhesus mothers cause increased levels of social involvement and 'maternal' characteristics, aiding the development and learning of the newborn.  Criticism for studies quoted  Above all, the main criticism regarding studies concerning social grooming is that almost all of them focus on primates and a narrow range of species within primates themselves. This, therefore, does not give us a well-rounded idea of what the cognitive or behavioural basis for social grooming is, nor does it completely outline all the effects (benefits or costs) of it. Moreover, we may not have all the relevant data concerning social grooming even in a well-studied species. Secondly, data for most species is derived based on the members of a single group. In primates, whose behaviour is highly flexible depending on the socio- environmental conditions, this poses as a particular challenge. Thirdly, most studies are observational and short-termed. Hence the direct link between social grooming and fitness or mate choice outcomes cannot be studied directly as in long-term direct or captive studies  See also  Cleaner fish * Cleaning symbiosis * Community cohesion * Licking * Personal grooming * Social cohesion  References   Further reading          External links  * Articles containing video clips Cleaning Ethology Hygiene fr:Toilettage ","title":"Social grooming"},{"id":"1840404","text":"√úberherrn is a municipality in the district of Saarlouis, in Saarland, Germany.

She is also the \\"Cheesecake\\" partner in Bubbles & Cheesecake, an Internet-based, multi-media collaboration with multi-disciplinary artist Allee Willis. Other musicians with whom she has collaborated include David Bowie, Paula Cole, Dr. Dre, Billy Preston, Dave Navarro and Michael Bubl√©, among others. Early years Palmer was born in Santa Monica, California in 1970, and grew up primarily in Redmond, Washington, near Seattle. Her Finnish-born mother, who worked for an airline, was the breadwinner in their unorthodox household. Her father was a writer who sang songs by the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Neil Young and Bob Dylan around the house. Growing up, Palmer played the family piano whenever possible, and played the flute in a school music ensemble. In the eighth grade, she switched to the saxophone so that she could sing with the school's jazz band. She soon began singing standards with the group, and became inspired by jazz singer Sarah Vaughan, whose innovative interpretations would make an enormous mark on Palmer's style. After high school, Palmer attended Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington before making her way to Boston, Massachusetts to stay with a friend. She attended and graduated from Berklee College of Music. Music career Palmer started playing live gigs during the period she lived in Boston. She particularly enjoyed stripped-down shows at small clubs, and she still loves intimate engagements offering the opportunity for spontaneous chemistry with the audience. Also during her time in Boston, Palmer began to seriously delve into songwriting, and landed a demo deal with Island Records. Palmer relocated to New York City (where she still performs regularly) in the mid-'90s. She recorded her self-titled 1996 debut album Holly Palmer, produced by Kenny White, which came out on Reprise Records, a Warner Bros. Records-affiliated label,\\"[ Holly Palmer Overview]\\", Allmusic, retrieved 2010-08-29\\"Holly Palmer: A different vibe\\", Philadelphia Tribune, May 23, 1997 and met with a positive response from critics,Ruggieri, Melissa (1997) \\"PALMER'S POP MAY BE TOO HIP FOR SOME\\", Richmond Times- Dispatch, March 27, 1997Rassenfos, Joe (1996) \\"Newcomer Holly Palmer is Impressive\\", Rocky Mountain News, August 30, 1996 and featured contributions from Bill Frisell and John Leventhal.Borzillo, Carrie (1996) \\"Holly Palmer Discovers Her Musical Niche\\", Billboard, July 20, 1996, p. 7, retrieved 2010-08-29 Surrounding its release, Holly toured the U.S. and Europe opening for artists including k.d. lang,\\"Artists: Holly Palmer\\", Blender.com, retrieved 2010-08-29 Shawn Colvin and Paula Cole. In 1998, Holly went to London and began recording what was intended to be her second disc for the label, Tender Hooks, with producer Howie B, who has also produced albums with U2, Bj√∂rk, and Robbie Robertson. She finished the album back in NYC with David Kahne (Regina Spektor, Sublime, The Bangles) producing two tracks. She amicably parted ways with Reprise, though, and the album remained unreleased for the time being. In 1999, David Bowie invited Palmer to sing background vocals on his album Hours; she was featured on the album-opening track \\"Thursday's Child.\\" Palmer subsequently toured worldwide with Bowie and his band as a vocalist and percussionist throughout 1999‚Äì2000. After completing the Bowie tour in 2000, Palmer settled in Los Angeles, where her music publisher Marla McNally introduced her to Grammy-winning, Emmy and Tony- nominated composer Allee Willis (whose songwriting credits include Earth Wind & Fire's \\"Boogie Wonderland\\" and \\"September\\", Broadway's \\"The Color Purple\\", \\"I'll Be There for You (Theme from Friends)\\", etc.). They began a songwriting collaboration, at the time primarily focused on songs for what would be Palmer's next solo album, I Confess. Palmer made a new deal with Tom Whalley and Jeff Ayeroff, the new heads of Warner Bros. for the album's release but, after completing the album, once again, she and the label saw things differently and went their separate ways. This time, Palmer was able to take the masters for both Tender Hooks and I Confess with her. I Confess album highlights included the single \\"Just So You Know\\", a Don Was-produced cover of the Holland-Dozier-Holland classic \\"You Keep Me Hangin' On\\" and Dr. Dre's mix of \\"Jumping Jack\\". Late, great keyboardist Billy Preston was spotlighted on the track \\"Down So Low\\", also featuring Joachim Cooder on drums. Holly launched her own label imprint, Bombshell Records, and independently released both I Confess and Tender Hooks on it in 2004. During this time, Palmer also recorded \\"Down with Love\\", a duet with Canadian pop star Michael Bubl√© that was the title song for a film starring Ren√©e Zellweger and Ewan McGregor. She was invited into the studio by hip-hop impresario Dr. Dre to record a duet with Mike Elizondo, which has yet to be released. She continued writing material for her next solo album, Songs For Tuesday, as well. Palmer spent most of 2006 on the road as a vocalist with the Gnarls Barkley live band, touring the world in support of their Grammy-winning debut album St. Elsewhere.\\"Up And Coming Music: The Soul-Sational Pairing Of Bubbles & Cheesecake\\", Hip-Hop Elements, November 4, 2007, retrieved 2010-08-29 At the end of 2006, Palmer returned to Los Angeles to recommence her songwriting partnership with Willis.

The Willis and Palmer/Bubbles & Cheesecake collaboration encompasses hand-made music, videos, art work, animation, merchandise, online characters, stories, games, all embedded into a social networking initiative. 2007 also marked the release Songs For Tuesday on Bombshell Records. Palmer's fourth solo album, it was recorded live in front of an audience in a Los Angeles recording studio over the course of two days in September 2005. Among its highlights is the Willis-Palmer co-write \\"Girl in Lust\\", which, like \\"I Confess\\" from Holly's previous album, was later also recorded and performed by Bubbles & Cheesecake. Palmer co-produced Songs For Tuesday with Joey Waronker (Beck, R.E.M.) ‚Äì featured on drums ‚Äì and Justin Meldal-Johnsen (Beck, Macy Gray, Ima Robot), the disc's bassist.

In 1945, she helped to found the Unitarian Service Committee of Canada (now called SeedChange), an international development organization consisting of a small group of aid workers sending supplies to war-torn Europe for relief and reconstruction. Attired in an army nurse's uniform and military-style hat, she traveled yearly to strife-torn and poverty-stricken parts of the world searching out towns and villages in need of Canadian assistance to recover from drought, war, disease and poverty. Early life Hitschmanova was born \\"Lotte Hitschmann\\" in Prague, Bohemia (now Czech Republic), on November 28, 1909, to Max Hitschmann and Else Theiner. She had a younger sister named Lilly born fifteen months later. Their father was a malt merchant with factories located beyond Prague's suburbs. The family lived in moderate wealth and comfort.Hyam, p. 417. She attended a coeducational high school Stephans Gymnasium where she graduated with honours. In 1929 she enrolled in the school of Philosophy at the University of Prague where she excelled at languages earning diplomas in Czech, German, English, French, and Spanish. In 1932 she went to Paris where she studied political science and journalism at the Sorbonne.Hyam, p. 417. While at the Sorbonne institute she obtained diplomas in journalism and French studies. In 1935 she returned to Prague to work as a freelance journalist. She also completed her PhD at Prague University. She worked for several newspapers (i.a. the French written Romanian newspaper L'Ind√©pendance Roumaine) (see below) as well as the Yugoslavian government news agency. Her writings reflected her anti-Nazi sentiments. When the Germans seized a third of Czechoslovakia following the Munich Agreement of September 30, 1938 she left the country and returned to Paris. She eventually ended up in Brussels, Belgium. At this time she changed her last name to the Slavic pronunciation Hitschmanova which sounded less like German.Hyam, p. 417. War years In Belgium, Dr. Hitschmanova worked as a journalist, but when the Germans invaded that country she escaped to France, eventually ending up in Marseilles, where she was able to obtain employment with an immigration service that assisted refugees. One day, while queuing in Marseilles's market over lunch hour, she fainted from fatigue and hunger.Hyam, p. 417. After regaining consciousness, Hitschmanova made her way to a medical clinic run by the Boston-based Unitarian Service Committee. This, claims her biographer, Clyde Sanger, was her first contact with the organization. She became even more familiar with it in January 1942 when she was appointed liaison officer with the Czechoslovak relief agency, Centre d'Aide Tch√©coslovaque, but not until 1945 would the USC become her life's major work and mission. In 1942, Lotta was able to escape from Europe by sailing from Lisbon to New York on a refugee-packed twin-screw steamer designed to carry bananas rather than passengers. After delivering a USC report to Boston, she quickly departed for Canada, which, unlike the United States, had granted her a visa. Lotta later claimed she reached Montreal \\"exhausted, with a feeling of absolute solitude in an entirely strange country ... I came with $60 in my pocket. I had an unpronounceable name. I weighed less than 100 lbs, and I was completely lost.\\"Sanger, p. 31. She was not lost for long, for on her fourth day in Canada she managed to obtain a secretarial job with a Montreal firm. Within three months she was in Ottawa working as a postal censor for the Department of War Services. She joined the Czechoslovakian National Alliance and helped raise money for Czech War Services in London, England. She also worked briefly for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.Hyam, p. 418. After the war ended, Hitschmanova was offered several jobs including one involving the rehabilitation of children in Czechoslovakia. When she learned that her parents had perished in a holding camp en route to the Auschwitz concentration camp she decided to stay in Canada.Schulman, p. 205. She found that her sister Lilly had moved to Israel and later on, Lilly relocated to Canada.Hyam, p. 418. Unitarian Service Committee In June 1945, Lotta helped to organize the Canadian branch of the Unitarian Service Committee. She was named as the first chairperson and she served in this position until 1949.Sanger, Appendix I, p. 252. The committee was affiliated with the Unitarian Church in Canada and the American Unitarian Association in Boston. In 1948 it severed its official link with the Unitarians and became an independent organization. However, it retained close ties with the Unitarians for many years as well as the word Unitarian in its name,Hyam, p. 418. until 2019 when the organization updated its name to SeedChange (S√®me l'avenir in French) in order to reflect both the organization's mission and history, and to provide a more memorable name for new generations of supporters. Its initial objective was the relief of distressed people in France and Czechoslovakia. Senator Cairine Wilson was made honorary chairman, but Hitschmanova, who filled the position of Executive Director, was the driving force behind the organization. On August 29, 1945, USC Canada was registered under the War Charities Act. At first it was only allowed to raise money from Unitarians but in February 1946 the appeal was extended to all Canadians.Hyam, p. 418. In the spring of 1946, she set off on a three-month tour of western Canada to tell audiences about the hunger and destitution in other countries, to furnish particulars about how Canadian contributions in previous years had been employed, and to appeal for funds and clothing. On her trip, she raised $40,000 and collected 30,000 kg of clothing. In the summer of 1946 she travelled to Europe to assess conditions and after that, she recommended that the organization focus on physically disabled children. Canadians sent food, money and prosthetic limbs for injured children. Through Hitschmanova's direction, USC Canada started a foster parent program. Canadians could sponsor a child for which they would receive a photo and a story.Hyam, p. 418. In 1949 Hitschmanova advised the USC to switch its efforts to Italy and Greece. USC's role in these two countries lasted until 1979.Sanger, p. 57. In 1950, USC expanded its programs to other parts of the world. From the early 1950s to the late 1970s, Korea was a major recipient of relief funds. USC Canada also set up programs in 20 other countries including India, Nepal, Vietnam, Lesotho, and Indonesia. During this period, she entered a routine of three months spent fund-raising in Canada and four months spent overseas to supervise USC Canada programs. She always travelled in her uniform that had become her trademark. This home-made creation of Hitschmanova's was modeled on the outfit worn by American army nurses ‚Äì olive-green for winter and khaki for summer. Both versions had the word 'Canada' stitched onto the lapel along with badges from the USC. While she never served in any army, Hitschmanova created the uniform because at the time UN workers were required to wear an identifiable uniform. She found the outfit comfortable to wear and made for a light travelling wardrobe.Hyam, pp. 419-20 and allowed her to more easily cross borders and access refugee camps. Her uniform has been preserved at the Canadian War Museum and has been featured at the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 to highlight her work with refugees (2014).Dan Conlin, \\"Lotta Hitschmanova‚Äôs Uniform\\", Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 During her fund-raising drives, Hitschmanova made appeals on radio and television. Thanks to her own journalism background, Hitschmanova knew what was needed to make a story and used this expertise to full advantage. Reporters and editors dubbed her \\"The Atomic Mosquito\\" because of her continuing success in getting good media coverage. The USC produced an annual film that portrayed her on her travels to inspect various projects. In 1972, the USC made a film called the USC Story created from film clips of the past 25 years.Hyam, p. 421. In 1970, Hitschmanova wrote a book entitled The USC Story: A Quarter Century of Loving Service by the Unitarian Service Committee about her experiences working for USC Canada. Through her fundraising efforts, between 1945 and 1984 the USC raised a total of $128,855,000.Sanger, Appendix II, pp. 252-3. Honours Throughout the years, Dr. Hitschmanova received many awards, including the Gold Medal from the Cross of France (1950) and the Medal of St. Paul from Greece (1952).Schulman, p. 205. Other awards included the Canadian Centennial Medal; the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal; the Republic of Korea: Order of Civil Merit; M√©daille de la Reconnaissance fran√ßaise; United Nations Headquarters Medal and the Decoration for Order and Peace, 1945-1949 from the Netherlands. These medals added rows of ribbons to her famous home-made uniform. In 1968 she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 1979. Dr. Lotta, as she was known, became a symbol of personal dedication, and made the Unitarian Service Committee at its well-publicised address of 56 Sparks Street, Ottawa, Ontario, a household name through her numerous radio and television ads. In 1982 she retired from her position as Executive Director due to ill health. Although she spent the final years of her life suffering from Alzheimer's disease, she succumbed to cancer. She died August 1, 1990. Legacy USC Canada, now called SeedChange, continues to operate in Ottawa at 56 Sparks Street. Since the early 2000s, SeedChange has been focusing its work on small-scale farmers in 12 countries, including Canada. Today, the mission of SeedChange is to \\"build food sovereignty by working with partners to enhance biodiversity, promote ecological food systems, and counter inequity.\\" The organization does this by focusing on activities that build food and livelihood security for small-scale farmers and preserve the agricultural biodiversity necessary to feeding a growing and changing planet. Vernon Burrows, a renowned scientist specializing in oat research, named one of his new varieties after Hitschmanova. The variety called ACLotta contains a day-length insensitive gene which allows the plant to flower in countries with shorter days. In 2002, USC Canada created the Lotta Hitschmanova Endowment Fund, which will collect money from bequests and donated securities. Its earnings will be used to support USC Canada's programs such as Seeds of Survival. In 2001, it was revealed that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had spied on Hitschmanova for 30 years ending in 1977. The RCMP, who during the Cold War had targeted various people and organizations, believed that Hitschmanova, as a Czech refugee, may have been sympathetic to Communism.

It consists of many classrooms, the main office, attendance office, magnet office, International Baccalaureate office, special education office, auditorium, band room, cooking room, and the choir room. It was built in a distinctive Art Deco style. The building was made of Texas limestone and the windows are the steel ribbon style. It consists of a single central block with the Ned S. Holmes Auditorium at the western end. The entrance to the theater is decorated by a relief map of Texas that indicates the state's mountain ranges and escarpment John F. Staub and Kenneth Franzheim designed it, while Lamar Q. Cato, Louis A. Glover, and Harry D. Payne assisted. An Italian American,Meeks, Flori. \\"Lamar High work won't hinder classes\\" (Archive).

Circa 2016 about 60% of the students attending Lamar live outside of the Lamar attendance boundary. In 2018 more than 50% of the student body was considered to be at risk of becoming school dropouts. =Historical demographics= In the Lamar's early history, students were segregated into different schools by race. In 1967 the school had 2,040 students. Until 1970 HISD categorized Hispanic students as being White, so Jay P. Childers, author of The Evolving Citizen: American Youth and the Changing Norms of Democratic Engagement, wrote that in terms of ethnic ratios, \\"Exact numbers for the late 1960s are impossible to calculate\\" for that reason.Childers, p. 49. , 9780271054117. As evidence that non-Hispanic White students were the vast majority at that time, he used images from the school newspaper, The Lancer. Childers wrote that ethnic change \\"seemed\\" to have quickly occurred after desegregation, citing the fact that in Spring 1974 African Americans made up six of twelve of the class officers and that in 1972 the cover of one issue of the Lancer showed a black male. Curtis wrote that the racial integration did not cause \\"unfortunate incidents\\" at the school.Curtis, Gregory. \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" (Archive). Texas Monthly. Vol. 3, No. 3. Emmis Communications, March 1975. ISSN 0148-7736. p. 96. In 1975 there were 1,900 students. Due to the outflow of the very wealthy the school was increasingly made up of middle-class students, and some students were of lower income backgrounds: 100 of them rented their own apartments. As of 1975 about 33% of Lamar's students were black. Many black parents sent their children to Lamar because of the school's strong academic reputation. By 1975 black students became members of clubs and the cheerleader corps of Lamar, and the student council president and \\"Lady of Lamar\\" was black. Curtis wrote that black students who did not wish to associate with whites often did not participate in the social environment while whites who did not wish to associate with blacks were still able to participate in that environment. Some black students emphasized with friends attending other schools who criticized them for going to Lamar that they only attended the school. Curtis wrote that some Lamar white students felt that \\"going to school with blacks [was] a duty they must perform, a quirk of history they must indulge.\\" In 2006 Lisa Viator from the Houston Chronicle stated that between the 1950s and 2006 the school had transitioned from \\"an exclusive suburban institution\\" to a multiethnic urban high school. As of 2010 the Lamar campus was built to accommodate 2,525 students but housed an additional 740 students as of the 2010‚Äì2011 school year. It is one of the most popular high schools for transferring in HISD and is one of the most ethnically diverse in the city.Mellon, Ericka. \\"HISD faces politically tough choices in closing schools.\\" Houston Chronicle.

After desegregation in the 1970s and the resulting social class changes, the percentage of students moving on to colleges and universities was down to about 66% by 1975. At that time there were declines in the National Merit Qualifying Exam and SAT test scores. In 2007, Lamar was ranked as in Jay Mathews Newsweek's lists of the top high schools in the United States.Mellon, Ericka. \\"Houston vs. Dallas.\\" Houston Chronicle. May 21, 2007. Many students in other parts of Houston ISD transfer to Lamar to escape home schools that do not have a good academic performance, causing the attendance figures of those schools to suffer. In 2007 Todd Spivak of the Houston Press reported about the magazine's feature \\"These Kids Go to the Best Public High School in Houston.\\" Spivak said that Lamar High School, which he described as \\"well-regarded,\\" received a lower rating due to a 66% graduation rate.

In the 1970s female and male students aspired to become cheerleaders. Curtis stated that being a cheerleader gave students the popularity needed to be elected in student government and club positions, such as the student body president, Key Club president, president of the Ramal club, and the president of the Pow Wow club.Curtis, Gregory. \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" (Archive).

The Lamar administration did not permit the establishment of fraternities and sororities. In 1975 Mirabeau, Niwauna, and Wachaka were the active girls' clubs while two others were inactive. The main boys' clubs were Pow Pow and Ramal.Curtis, Gregory. \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" (Archive). Texas Monthly. Vol. 3, No. 3. Emmis Communications, March 1975. ISSN 0148-7736. p. 60. At the time the clubs had a membership capacity; those with more prospective members than slots held lotteries that randomly determined who is permitted to join. Many clubs at the time had a tradition of hazing new members. Several clubs engaged in charitable events and fundraisers, and they also sponsored parties. Curtis wrote that \\"But what they do is really secondary, just as what fraternities and sororities do is secondary. It is the belonging that counts.\\" Curtis added that the clubs \\"have an aura of exclusivity; kids can tell whether or not they're really wanted there.\\" Due to the demographic changes in the 1970s, according to Curtis, interest in these social clubs decreased, with the two boys' clubs not having full membership rosters and two girls' clubs being inactive in 1975.

Early life Bubas graduated from Gary Lew Wallace High School in 1944. After finishing high school he enrolled at the University of Illinois, playing the 1944‚Äì45 season for the Fighting Illini.All-Time Illini Rosters He then went on to North Carolina State University where he played for Everett Case. Bubas was an All-Southern Conference selection twice. After he graduated in 1951 he stayed on as a freshman coach until 1955 and as a varsity assistant coach until he was hired by Duke University in 1959. At Duke University During the 1960s Bubas expanded Duke University's basketball program. He took it from a successful regional program that won a lot of games to a national program. =Recruiting= During the tenure of Bubas at Duke University, the school did not recruit black athletes. Bubas is widely credited with pioneering the art of recruiting by targeting white players very early and gathering information on them before other coaches had learned of them and would send newspaper clippings of Duke games to prospects. As North Carolina legendary coach Dean Smith once stated, > \\"Vic taught us all how to recruit, we had been starting on prospects in the > fall of their senior years while Vic was working on them their junior year. > For a while, all of us were trying to catch up with him.\\" Bubas's tireless efforts paid off as he brought in future All-Americans from all over the country. His first big coup was getting eventual National Player Of The Year Art Heyman to go to Duke. Heyman was originally set to attend North Carolina but a near fight between Heyman's stepfather and UNC head coach Frank McGuire (McGuire took it personally when Heyman's stepfather referred to his program as \\"a factory\\") sent Heyman on a different path and Bubas stepped in and was able to convince Heyman to attend Duke. Another big coup was getting Lexington, Kentucky native and eventual two-time All-American Jeff Mullins from the University of Kentucky and legendary Adolph Rupp. Paired together, Heyman and Mullins formed a devastating duo, reaching the Final Four in 1963 and 1964. =Performance= At the time, freshmen were not allowed to play on the varsity and only the winner of the ACC Tournament could go to the NCAA Tournament. Vic Bubas' Duke teams still flourished. What began during that 1959‚Äì60 season grew rapidly over the course of the decade. In that first season, Duke was blown out twice each by Wake Forest and North Carolina. But in the ACC Tournament, Bubas got revenge, stunning 16th-ranked North Carolina and 18th-ranked Wake Forest in the title game for Duke's first ACC championship. Duke received the automatic bid in the NCAA tournament, where the Blue Devils won two games before losing to 12th-ranked NYU. It was a very surprising first season for the young coach. As his program progressed, Duke would finish in the AP Top-10 basketball poll in seven of his ten seasons. He led Duke to the NCAA Final Four three times (1963, 64 and 66). His teams finished first in league play on four occasions and won four ACC championships, competing in the ACC Tournament championship game in eight of his ten seasons. Bubas led Duke to a 213‚Äì67 record, which was the 3rd-highest win total in America during the Sixties. His .761 winning percentage ranks tenth all-time among NCAA coaches. Retirement and death Bubas retired from coaching in 1969 and then served as a Duke administrator, eventually becoming the vice president of the university. In 1976, he became the first commissioner of the Sun Belt Conference, a position he held for fourteen years until his retirement. In 2007 Bubas was inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame.Vic Bubas . College Basketball Experience.

It has been phased out and is no longer necessary. Establishment SOES was first introduced in December 1984 for 25 stockshttp://finra.complinet.com/en/display/display.html?rbid=2403&record;_id=958&element;_id=717 to provide automatic order execution for individual traders with orders less than or equal to 1000 shares. The lack of liquidity after the 1987 market crash led NASDAQ to enforce mandatory use of the SOES by all market makers using the NASDAQ National Market System,http://finra.complinet.com/en/display/display_main.html?rbid=2403&element;_id=974 providing excellent liquidity for smaller investors and traders. Rules There were several restrictions for those who used SOES, rather than a traditional electronic communication network (ECN), to place their orders. # Trades could not be in excess of 1000 shares for a particular stock. # SOES did not allow trades in stocks that were trading at prices greater than $250 per share. # Once a trader received an execution through SOES, they had to wait 10 minutes to place a trade on the same side of the market in the same stock. # Institutions and stockbrokers were not allowed to place orders for their own accounts through SOES, but they could for a client's account. # Market makers had to honor their advertised bid/ask prices to SOES orders, provided that they were for the amount that the market maker was seeking. Initial reactions Initially, when SOES was mandatory, it was met with heavy pessimism from NASDAQ member firms because it forced them to execute all SOES trades that met the market maker's advertised price. There were also significant limitations implemented to prevent day traders from exploiting the system and taking advantage of old prices quoted by market makers. Effect SOES revamped the trading market for individual investors. It gave small investors and traders the opportunity to compete on a level playing field with larger investors, such as institutions, for access to orders and execution.

Situated at the foot of the S√°r-hegy and M√°tra mountains, it is the home of numerous food production plants, including milk production and sausage factories. It is also the home of many vineyards on the slopes of the S√°rhegy. The Art-Nouveau and Baroque buildings around the main square were reconstructed after a disastrous fire started in the local hospital in 1917, destroying a number of buildings housing important Jewish institutions and leaving in all around 8,000 homeless.  Name  Baroque Church of Saint Bernard of Gy√∂ngy√∂s Gy√∂ngy√∂s 1938 The meaning of the town's name is \\"Made of Pearls\\"; Croats from Hungary call this city ƒêunƒëu≈° (pronounced as \\"Dyun-dyush\\").

History Gy√∂ngy√∂s was home to a large Jewish community before World War II. In 1942, anti-Jewish laws were adopted in the province, affecting the Jews of the town. Following the occupation of Hungary by the German army in March 1944, 1800 Jews were locked in a ghetto.

Previously he was the assistant manager of the England national football team. His son, Dean, is a professional footballer playing for Milton Keynes Dons. Playing career Lewington started his career at Chelsea in the 1970s, and played a season at Vancouver Whitecaps in 1979 where he was part of the Whitecaps' championship squad that won the NASL Soccer Bowl 1979, before a loan spell at Wimbledon. In 1980, he transferred to Fulham, and he was to go on and make over 170 League appearances for them before a season at Sheffield United in 1985‚Äì86. After that season he returned to Fulham and went on to play another 60 league matches for them.Football Lge Career Stats at Neil Brown Managerial career Lewington with Fulham in 2009 Lewington became player-manager of Fulham after they were relegated to the Football League Third Division in July 1986. Lewington, still only 29, was the youngest manager in the Football League at the time. Fulham's budget was tight and they could only manage an 18th-place finish in Lewington's first season as manager. Off the field, the club was unstable after two takeovers in quick succession and the suggestion of a merger with their West London rivals Queens Park Rangers. The next two seasons showed no sign of an up-turn in fortune, but in 1989, Lewington guided the club to the play-offs, although they were unsuccessful in achieving promotion. The following season saw the club struggle against relegation once more. At the end of that season, Alan Dicks was brought in, with Lewington becoming his assistant. Lewington had spells as caretaker manager at Fulham in 1991 and 1994, before joining Crystal Palace as a coach, becoming assistant to Alan Smith as Palace were relegated from the Premiership. Brentford were taken over by former Palace owner Ron Noades in 1998, Brentford's \\"chairman-manager\\" brought in Lewington as a Coach. After Noades relinquished his team-selection duties in 2000, Lewington was appointed as manager of Brentford, taking them to a losing appearance in the Football League Trophy final in 2001 and guiding them to 14th in Division Two. He left at the end of the 2000‚Äì01 season to become Gianluca Vialli's reserve team manager at Watford: a difficult role, as Vialli never let any first-team players play for the reserve side. When Vialli was sacked in the summer 2002, Lewington was appointed manager. Like with Fulham 16 years earlier, Lewington assumed control of a club that had an extremely limited budget, with the club crippled from the collapse of ITV Digital and the high-spending of the Vialli era, which had failed to result in promotion to the Premier League. Despite this, Lewington guided the club to two middle table finishes and two cup semi-finals ‚Äî a 2‚Äì1 loss to Southampton in the FA Cup in 2003 and a 2‚Äì0 loss (over two legs) to Liverpool in the League Cup two seasons later. Just two months after the Liverpool game, Lewington was sacked, after a poor run of league form. In July 2005, Lewington returned to Fulham after ten years away, as reserve team manager, under manager Chris Coleman. By this time, Fulham were an established Premier League club with healthy finances. In December 2007, Lewington served a brief stint as caretaker manager after the departure of Lawrie Sanchez, managing the team for three games until Roy Hodgson was appointed full-time. He remained at Craven Cottage as part of the management team as assistant manager. He was replaced as assistant manager by Mark Bowen when Mark Hughes became manager and became the First Team Coach. On 17 October 2010, it was announced on the Fulham website that Lewington had been given the job of leading the club's Youth Development Program and that taking his position as first team coach would be Glyn Hodges. Mark Hughes resigned after the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season and his successor Martin Jol reinstated Lewington as First Team Coach in June 2011, alongside Jol's assistants Michael Lindeman and Cornelius Jol. Jol said: \\"We started off with him because he's probably a main figure here, at this club, he knows everything.\\" On 4 May 2012, it was confirmed that Lewington would become England assistant manager alongside Roy Hodgson, who had just accepted the FA's offer to manage the England team, having previously managed West Bromwich Albion. On 27 June 2016 he resigned as part of the England coaching staff after the embarrassing defeat to Iceland in Euro 2016. On 12 September 2017, following the appointment of Roy Hodgson as manager of Crystal Palace FC, it was announced that Lewington would once again return to the club as assistant manager.

It is a congenital disorder. Since the deletion takes place on the q arm of chromosome 11, it is also called 11q terminal deletion disorder. The deletion may range from 5 million to 16 million deleted DNA base pairs. The severity of symptoms depends on the number of deletions; the more deletions there are, the more severe the symptoms are likely to be. People with Jacobsen syndrome have serious intellectual disabilities, dysmorphic features, delayed development and a variety of physical problems including heart defects. Research shows that almost 88.5% of people with Jacobsen syndrome have a bleeding disorder called Paris-Trousseau syndrome. Jacobsen syndrome is catastrophic in 1 out of every 5 cases, with children usually dying within the first 2 years of life due to heart complications. Signs and symptoms Almost all children with Jacobsen syndrome have intellectual disabilities, which range from mild to moderate depending upon the number of the deletions of genes from the chromosome. Children with intellectual disability take more time than normal to learn new things and acquire new skills. They have problems with assembling new information or adapting to novel situations and associating two events or things together. Most children with the syndrome have delayed development, including delayed speech, motor disabilities and lack of coordination, which makes simple activities like sitting, standing and walking difficult. Most children eventually start speaking, but in cases with severe intellectual disability language use is highly restricted. They have distinctive facial features like: *Small head (microcephaly) *Pointed forehead (trigonocephaly) *Small ears which are low-set *Widely-spaced eyes (hypertelorism) *Droopy eyelids (ptosis) *Broad nasal bridge *Abnormally thin upper lips *Downturned corners of the mouth *Excess skin covering in the inner corner of eyes (epicanthal folds) Some children also suffer from behavioural problems like distractibility, hyperactivity, impaired communication and social skills, which qualifies them for a diagnosis of ASD and ADHD. Heart defects are very common in children with Jacobsen syndrome. 88.5% of people with the disorder have Paris-Trousseau syndrome, which is a bleeding disorder and causes a lifelong risk of abnormal bleeding and bruising due to dysfunction in the platelets. Other symptoms may include eye problems, ear and sinus infections, hearing problems, bone deformities, growth hormone deficiency, gastrointestinal problems, kidney malfunctions, etc. Cause Jacobsen syndrome is caused by deletion of genetic material from the long arm of chromosome 11. The size of deletion may vary across patients, but the deletion always occurs at the end terminal of the q arm of chromosome 11. There are three ways in which the deletion could occur: de novo deletion- this is a random event that occurred during the formation of the sperm or the egg or during the cell division in the embryonic stage, where genes from chromosome 11 get deleted. Imbalanced translocation- in this case, a parent with balanced translocation or other types of chromosomal rearrangement can pass on these genes to their children which further results in an imbalanced translocation. The affected children have deletions on chromosome 11 as well as some extra genetic material from another chromosome. Ring chromosome 11- in this case genetic material from both long and short arm of the chromosome get deleted, and the remaining part joins together and forms a ring like structure. Here the affected person would have symptoms associated with both 11q and 11p deletion. Genetics If de novo deletion occurs then both the parents have normal chromosomes, and chances that another child will have the deletion decline. Very few cases have been found in which the deletion has been present in mosaic form (where some of the cells have deletion on chromosome 11 and some do not, and the symptoms are less severe) in one of the parents, which increases the risk of having another child with Jacobsen syndrome. When the child's chromosomal abnormality occurs due to one of the parents' balanced translocation, the chances of another child having the abnormality is high. Diagnosis Diagnosing Jacobsen syndrome can be difficult in some cases because it is a rare chromosomal disorder. There are a variety of tests that can be carried out, like karyotypes, cardiac echocardiograms, a renal sonogram, a platelet count, blood counts, a brain imaging study. Genetic testing can be carried out for diagnosis. Here chromosomes are stained to give a barcode like appearance and studied under the microscope, which reveals the broken and deleted genes. The condition can also be diagnosed early in the prenatal stage if there are any abnormalities seen in the ultrasound. A simple assessment of the symptoms can be done to diagnose the syndrome. A thorough physical examination could be carried out to assess the symptoms. Treatment There has been no treatment discovered for Jacobsen syndrome to date, but the symptoms can be treated. 56% of children with Jacobsen syndrome have congenital heart problems; to keep them in check, a baseline evaluation can be made by a paediatric cardiologist by carrying out an electrocardiogram or echocardiogram. Any problems that are found can be treated then. Almost all affected children are born with a bleeding disorder; monthly CBT may help ease the problem. Consecutively. platelet transfusion and ddAVP can be carried out. Medication that interferes with platelet count should be avoided, and oral contraceptive therapy may be considered for women with heavy bleeding during menses. Children affected with Jacobsen syndrome have severe to moderate intellectual disabilities and cognitive impairment. An evaluation by a neuropsychologist or a behaviour specialist like a psychiatrist or psychologist can be performed, including brain imaging like MRI or ERP. Later, as deemed appropriate, intervention programs can be carried through. Music therapy is very beneficial for language development. According to the age, vision and hearing tests can aid in fixing problems related cognition. For problems related to behaviour like ADHD, medication or therapy would be required but a combination of both is more effective. An ophthalmologist should be consulted to treat the eye defects. Play and interactive games encourage the child to speak. Habilitiation in children should begin at an early age. A habilitation team includes professionals with special expertise in how disability affects everyday life, health and development. The entire family is supported to help the affected children and their families adjust better. Prevalence The estimated prevalence of Jacobsen syndrome is believed to be approximately 1 out of every 100,000 births. For reasons unknown, females are twice as likely to have Jacobsen syndrome than males. No preference for any race or ethnicity has been reported so far. History The syndrome was first identified by Danish geneticist Petrea Jacobsen in 1973 and was named after her. She discovered Jacobsen syndrome in a family where multiple people had the disorder. She discovered that the affected children had unbalanced translocation between chromosome 11 and 21 which they had inherited from one of their parents who had balanced translocation. Since then, only 200 cases have been reported of Jacobsen syndrome in medical literature.

Owned and operated by Lagard√®re Active, a subsidiary of the Lagard√®re Group, it is one of the leading radio broadcasting stations in France and its programmes can be received throughout the country. History In 1955, to circumvent the prohibition of commercial broadcasting in France after the Second World War, Europe n¬∞ 1 was established in the Saarland, a German state that borders France and Luxembourg. Transmissions were not legally authorised, however, until France's post-war administration of the Saarland ceased and sovereignty returned to West Germany in 1957; so, during its first two years (1955‚Äì1957), under the direction of Louis Merlin, who had defected from Radio Luxembourg, Europe n¬∞ 1 was a pirate radio station. In 1959 the French government bought part of the broadcasting corporation, and this interest is administered today by the Lagard√®re Group. All programming has always been produced in Paris. For the few parts of France who can't receive the FM signal, longwave broadcast still exists : the programme feed is transferred over ISDN lines to the transmitting station situated on the territory of the villages of Berus and Felsberg in the Saarland, Germany. From its beginning, Europe n¬∞1's priorities were two-fold: first, news and cultural information with an emphasis on eyewitness accounts rather than an announcer with a script; second, shows aimed at establishing bonds with listeners, including plays, contests, informal talk, popular music, and street-level politics. In both respects, it was a departure from radio formats of the day. In the 1960s, Europe 1 pioneered a new tone in French radio. Salut les copains became an icon of popular culture and the baby boom generation. Europe 1 played a role in the May 68 political crisis by being the principal source of information untainted by government sanction; it was nicknamed \\"barricade radio\\". In the 1970s, President Giscard d'Estaing criticized its \\"mocking\\" tone. When the industrialist Jean-Luc Lagard√®re became president of Europe 1 group, some feared the network might lose its independent point of view. Since the 1980s, Europe 1 has experienced decreases in audience, and average age of listeners has steadily increased. Both can be traced to the proliferation of FM radio, after socialist President Fran√ßois Mitterrand made FM private radio legal in 1981. In 1986, for equality, the regulation authorities gave FM frequencies to Europe 1 and other peripheral radios still emitting from outside France. A network of Europe 1 FM transmitters was established within France. They later had to be shared with Europe 2, now Virgin Radio. In the 1990s, Europe 1 became a news and talk network. Jean-Pierre Elkabbach became president in 2005. He was dismissed by the CSA (Comit√© de Surveillance de l'Audiovisuel) after announcing the death of Pascal Sevran prematurely in June 2008 and was replaced by Alexandre Bompard, former Director of the Sports at Canal+. Today, Europe 1 is France's fifth most popular network, with the other four being RTL (radio-television Luxembourg), France Inter (state-owned, general), NRJ (music) and France Info (state-owned, news). Europe 1 also became a supplementary active member of the European Broadcasting Union in 1978 and in 1982, an active member. Programming Over the last fifty years, the best-known programs on Europe 1 have included: 'Pour ceux qui aiment le jazz' (\\"For those who love jazz\\") hosted by Daniel Filipacchi and Franck T√©not, 'Sign√© Furax' (\\"Signed, Furax\\", a comic adventure serial), 'Salut les copains' (\\"Hi, friends\\", a pop music programme), 'Campus' (book reviews, interviews with literary personalities, and chat about current events and culture), 'Vous √™tes formidables' (a programme devoted to \\"demonstrations of solidarity\\"), 'Bonjour, monsieur le maire' (aimed at rural France), 'L'horoscope de Madame Soleil' (astrology), 'Top 50' (a reprise of the musical charts), and 'Le club de la presse' (\\"Press Club\\", political conversation). BBC Radio 5 had a translated version of Top 50 called Le Top (with Marc et La M√®che) from 1990 to 1994. Noted journalists, presenters, and performers have included: Patrick Topaloff, Maurice Siegel, Jean Gorini, Andr√© Arnaud, Pierre Bouteiller, Pierre Bellemare, Francis Blanche, Daniel Filipacchi, Frank T√©not, Lucien Morisse, Robert Willar, Albert Simon, Laurent Ferrari and Madame Soleil. Former is Wendy Bouchard. She was succeeded by Laurence Ferrari in 2014. Europe 1 on longwave Europe 1 is broadcast in France, from France, through a dense FM network since 1986, but the station was also broadcast on longwave by Europe 1's longwave transmitter until the end of 2019. The longwave feed was transmitted by Europ√§ische Rundfunk- und Fernseh-AG (in English, European Radio and Television Company), broadcasting on longwave at 183 kHz from Felsberg in the Saarland. Car radios in France scanned in 3 kHz steps making it easy to tune 183 kHz. For longwave, the Felsberg antenna system beamed Europe 1's signal southwestward towards France. In the easterly direction, transmissions were attenuated, so, in Eastern Europe, only a weak signal could be heard. However, because of a defect in the antenna system, only the carrier frequency was properly screened to the east; the sidebands suffered less attenuation, so that, in the east, sideband reception was adequate (especially if using an SSB receiver) but distorted. Following the collapse of one mast in the four-mast phased array on 8 October 2012, the two- mast reserve antenna was used, resulting in a reduced signal in parts of France but a stronger and undistorted signal in northern Europe and the British Isles. Carrier frequencies on the longwave band are assigned as integer multiples of nine kHz ranging from 153 to 279 kHz. However, the Europe 1 transmitter's frequency, 183 kHz, was offset from the usual nine kHz multiples established under the Geneva Plan. For longwave, in Felsberg, the four guyed antenna masts which were erected in 1954 and 1955 average 277 metres in height. The building where the transmitters were housed is an architecturally unusual, prestressed-concrete construction that needs no internal supporting columns. It has been designated an architectural monument by the European Union and is a protected structure. It was reported on 23 December 2019 that an email from Lagard√®re Active had confirmed that the longwave service of Europe 1 would cease transmission at midnight CET on 1 January 2020. In the event, Europe 1 longwave transmission ceased on 31 December 2019 at 23:30 CET. Visual identity =Logos= File:Logo Europe1 1955.pngFirst old logo of Europe 1 from 1955 until 1965.

the relationship between God the Father and the Son of God, adopted by some 4th century Christians. Though the doctrine modified the teachings of Arianism, it still rejected the doctrine that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are co-eternal, and of the same substance, or consubstantial, and was therefore considered to be heretical by many contemporary Christians.\\"semi-Arianism.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2012. Arius held that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were three separate essences or substances (ousia or hypostases) and that the Son and Spirit derived their divinity from the Father, were created, and were inferior to the Godhead of the Father. Semi-Arians asserted that the Son was \\"of a similar substance\\" (homoiousios) as the Father but not \\"of the same substance\\" (homoousios). This doctrinal controversy revolved around two words that in writing differed only by a single letter but whose difference in meaning gave rise to furious contests.Gary Holloway, Randall J. Harris, Mark Cothran Black (editors), Theology Matters (College Press 1998 ), pp. 24‚Äì25 History Arianism was the view of Arius and his followers, the Arians, that Jesus was subordinate to, and of a different being (ousia) to God the Father. Arians opposed the view that the three persons of the Trinity were of one being or substance. Arianism spread among the Church of Alexandria and the Eastern Mediterranean. After the First Council of Nicaea condemned Arianism as heresy, many Christians adopted compromise views in which they remained in communion with Arians without adopting Arianism itself. Various formulae, such as the homoiousian and the homoean, were proposed to compromise between Arian teachings (heteroousios) and the doctrine of one substance (homoousios) asserted in the Nicene Creed. After the 325 Council of Nicea anathemized Arianism: the majority of the Eastern bishops, who agreed to the deposition of Athanasius of Alexandria at Tyre in 335 and received the Arians to communion at Jerusalem on their repentance, were not Arians. The Dedication Council of Antioch in 341 put forth a creed which was unexceptionable but for its omission of the Nicene formula \\"of One Substance.\\" Even disciples of Arius such as bishop George of Laodicea (335-47) and Eustathius of Sebaste (c. 356-80) joined the moderate party, and after the death of Eusebius of Nicomedia, the leaders of the court faction, Ursacius of Singidunum, Valens of Mursa and Germinius of Sirmium, were not tied to any formula, for Emperor Constantius II himself hated Arianism, though he disliked Athanasius yet more. When Marcellus of Ancyra was deposed in 336, he was succeeded by Basil. Marcellus was reinstated by the Council of Serdica and bishop Julius of Rome in 343, but Basil was restored in 350 by Constantius, over whom he gained considerable influence. He was the leader of a council at Sirmium in 351, held against Photinus who had been a deacon at Ancyra, and the canons of this synod begin by condemning Arianism, though they do not quite come up to the Nicene standard. Basil had afterwards a disputation with the Anomoean A√´tius. After the defeat of Magnentius at Mursa in 351, Valens, bishop of that city, became the spiritual director of Constantius. In 355 Valens and Ursacius obtained the exile of the Western confessors Eusebius, Lucifer of Cagliari, Hilary of Poitiers, and Liberius followed. In 357 they issued the second Creed of Sirmium, or \\"formula of Hosius\\", in which homoousios and homoiousios were both absent. Eudoxius seized the See of Antioch, and supported A√´tius and his disciple Eunomius. The Third Council of Sirmium in 357 was the high point of Arianism. The Seventh Arian Confession (Second Sirmium Confession) held that both homoousios (of one substance) and homoiousios (of similar substance) were unbiblical and that the Father is greater than the Son. (This confession was later known as the Blasphemy of Sirmium.) > But since many persons are disturbed by questions concerning what is called > in Latin substantia, but in Greek ousia, that is, to make it understood more > exactly, as to 'coessential,' or what is called, 'like-in-essence,' there > ought to be no mention of any of these at all, nor exposition of them in the > Church, for this reason and for this consideration, that in divine Scripture > nothing is written about them, and that they are above men's knowledge and > above men's understanding; It has been noted also that the Greek term \\"homoousian\\", which Athanasius of Alexandria favored, was actually a term that was reported to be put forth and favored also by Sabellius, and was a term that many followers of Athanasius took issue with and were uneasy about. The Semi-Arians also objected to the term. Their objection to the term \\"homoousian\\" was that it was considered to be \\"un-Scriptural, suspicious, and of a Sabellian tendency.\\"Select Treatises of St. Athanasius - In Controversy With the Arians - Freely Translated by John Henry Cardinal Newmann - Longmans, Green, and Co., 1911, footnote, page 124 This was because Sabellius also considered the Father and the Son to be \\"one substance\\", meaning that, to Sabellius, the Father and Son were \\"one essential Person\\" interacting with creation as necessary. =Basil of Ancyra= In the Lent of 358, Basil, along with many bishops, was holding the dedicatory feast of a new church he had built at Ancyra when he received a letter from George of Laodicea, relating how Eudoxius had approved of A√´tius, and begging Macedonius of Constantinople, Basil, and the rest of the assembled bishops to decree the expulsion of Eudoxius and his followers from Antioch, else that great see were lost. In consequence, the Synod of Ancyra published a long reply addressed to George and the other bishops of Phoenicia in which they recite the Creed of Antioch (341), adding explanations against the \\"unlikeness\\" of the Son to the Father taught by the Arians and Anomoeans, (from anomoios), and showing that the very name of father implies a son of like substance (homoiousios, or homoios kat ousian) Anathematisms are appended in which Anomoeanism is explicitly condemned and the teaching of \\"likeness of substance\\" enforced. The nineteenth of these canons forbids the use also of homoousios and tautoousios; this may be an afterthought due to the instance of Macedonius, as Basil does not seem to have insisted on it later. Legates were dispatched to the Council at Sirmium: Basil, Eustathius of Sebaste, an ascetic of no dogmatic principles, Eleusius of Cyzicus, a follower of Macedonius, and the priest Leontius, one of the emperor's chaplains. They arrived just in time, for the emperor had been lending his ear to a Eudoxian, but he now veered round, issuing a letter (Sozomen, IV, xiv) declaring the Son to be \\"like in substance\\" to the Father, and condemning the Arians of Antioch. =Epiphanius of Salamis= In the mid-4th century Epiphanius stated, \\"Semi- Arians... hold the view of the Son, that he was forever with the Father... but has been begotten without beginning and not in time... But all of these negate, or it has been said, blaspheme the Holy Spirit, and do not count him in the Godhead with the Father and the Son.\\"Epiphanius. The Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis, Books II and III (Sects 47-80), De Fide). Section VI, Verses 1,1 and 1,3. Translated by Frank Williams. EJ Brill, New York, 1994, pp. 471‚Äì472. According to Sozomen, at this point Pope Liberius was released from exile upon signing three formul√¶ combined by Basil. Basil persuaded Constantius to summon a general council, Ancyra being proposed, then Nicomedia (both in Asia Minor), but as the latter city was destroyed by an earthquake, Basil was again at Sirmium in 359 where the Arianizers had meanwhile regained their footing; with Germinius of Sirmium, George of Alexandria, Ursacius and Valens, and bishop (later saint) Marcus of Arethusa, he held a conference which lasted until night. A confession of faith, ridiculed under the name of the \\"dated creed\\", was drawn up by Marcus on 22 May (Hilary, \\"Fragment. xv\\"). Arianism was of course rejected, but the homoios kata ten ousian was not admitted, and the expression kata panta homoios, \\"like in all things\\", was substituted. Basil was disappointed, and added to his signature the explanation that the words \\"in all things\\" meant not only in will, but in existence and being (kata ten hyparxin kai kata to einai). Not content with this, Basil, George of Laodicea and others published a joint explanation (Epiph., lxxiii, 12-22) that \\"in all things\\" must include \\"substance\\". =At Seleucia, 359= The court party arranged that two councils should be held, one at Rimini (Italy) and the other at Seleucia. At Seleucia, in 359, the Semi‚ÄìArians were in a majority, being supported by such men as St. Cyril of Jerusalem, his friend Silvanus of Tarsus and even Hilary of Poitiers, but they were unable to obtain their ends. Basil, Silvanus and Eleusius, therefore, went as envoys to Constantinople, where a council was held in 360, which followed Rimini in condemning homoiousios together with homoousios and allowed homoios alone, without addition. This new phrase was the invention of Acacius of C√¶sarea, who now deserted the more extreme Arians and became leader of the new \\"Homoean\\" party. He procured the exile of Macedonius, Eleusius, Basil, Eustathius, Silvanus, Cyril and others. Constantius II died in 361. Under Julian the exiles returned. Basil was probably dead. Macedonius organized a party which confessed the Son to be kata panta homoios, while it declared the Holy Ghost to be the minister and servant of the Father and a creature. Eleusius joined him, and so did Eustathius for a time. This remnant of the Semi-Arian party held synods at Zele and elsewhere. The accession of Jovian, who was orthodox, induced the versatile Acacius, with Meletius of Antioch and twenty-five bishops, to accept the Nicene formula, adding an explanation that the Nicene Fathers meant by homoousios merely homoios kat ousian ‚Äì thus Acacius had taken up the original formula of the Semi-Arians. In 365 the Macedonians assembled at Lampsacus under the presidency of Eleusius and condemned the Councils of Ariminum and Antioch (in 360), asserting again the likeness in substance. But the threats of the Arian emperor Valens caused Eleusius to sign an Arian creed at Nicomedia in 366. He returned to his diocese full of remorse, and begged for the election of another bishop, but his diocesans refused to let him resign. The West was at peace under Valentinian I, so the Semi-Arians sent envoys to that emperor and to the pope to get help. Pope Liberius refused to see them until they presented him with a confession of faith which included the Nicene formula. He seems to have been unaware that the party now rejected the divinity of the Holy Ghost; but this was perhaps not true of the envoys Eustathius and Silvanus. On the return of the legates, the documents they brought were received with great joy by a synod at Tyana, which embraced the Nicene faith. But another synod in Caria still refused the homoousion. =Council of Constantinople and after= In 381 the First Council of Constantinople was also called in order to attempt to deal with the binitarians who were mainly Semi-Arians then. However, as the Trinity was officially finalized at this time, the offended binitarians walked out. For the rest of the history of the Semi-Arians (they were also called Macedonians), see Pneumatomachi.John McClintock, James Strong Cyclop√¶dia of Biblical, theological, and ecclesiastical literature: Vol 8 - 1894 - \\"The first canon anathematizes the \\"Semi-Arians or Pneumatomachi;\\" the seventh canon uses the name \\"Macedonians,\\" and orders the admission of converts from this heresy to be by unction\\" Also, in more modern times, Semi-Arian groups are said to include non-Trinitarian groups such as Jehovah's WitnessesInstitute for Metaphysical Studies - The Arian Christian Bible - Metaphysical Institute, 2010.

Accessed August 14, 2016. History The Exposition began with the All-Indian Fair first held in 1924. It was the successor to the Craterville Park Indian Fair, which had been held from 1924 through 1933 near Cache, Oklahoma. A group of people calling themselves the Southwest Indian Fair (SWIF) had met after the Caddo County Free Fair in 1935 to discuss their dissatisfaction with the Craterville Park demonstrations of Indian culture, which they felt was too ethnocentric and white-oriented. They felt that the Indian participants were treated as merely figureheads. The leaders of SWIF wanted to separate the dance performances from the county fair, and wanted the Caddo County Free Fair board to give them creative and management freedom over the production. In 1935 it was incorporated as the American Indian Exposition with the stated purpose of \\"promoting and retaining Indian cultural life, handicrafts, arts, crafts, and farming and livestock skills by providing a yearly showcase\\". The Exposition features a week-long program of dance contests, parades, pageants (Indian Princess, Beautiful Baby), sporting events such as softball as well as arts and crafts contests. The fairgrounds also provides camping accommodations for the participants. Nearby is the Southern Plains Indian Museum, the American Indian Hall of Fame, and Indian City USA. There was no expo in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Miss American Indian Exposition The title \\"Miss American Indian Exposition,\\" came into existence in the 1930s, when a young woman, Imogene Carter, was selected to represent the AIE. The event has been reintroduced many times, and the requirements have undergone several changes. In 2015, the AIE Board retired the title until it could reassess the qualifications and other requirements. In January, 2016, AIE reinstated this aspect of the program. It opened competition to any young American Indian woman who wished to enter. Previously, competition was limited to actual tribal princesses. To promote education, the title holder would be expected to serve as a mentor for young women, and the winner each year would receive a scholarship. The winner of the 2016 competition is Marquela Pewewardy, who is 17 years old and whose mother is Kiowa and whose father is Comanche.She plans to enroll in Oklahoma University, when she graduates from Elgin High School.\\"2016 Miss American Indian Exposition.\\" March 24, 2016.

In addition, Twilight Sentinel also allows the driver to set a timer (located with the headlight switch) that delays shutting off the headlights for a specified time period, usually up to three minutes. The driver can park the vehicle, shut off the car's engine and exit the automobile after dark, then use the headlights to light the path into a nearby building, such as a house, before the system shuts the headlights off automatically. An electric photocell located in the dashboard detects the environmental lighting conditions and activates the headlights as needed. Usually, this means turning on the headlights at dusk and shutting them off after sunrise. The system requires that a change in the environmental lighting conditions remains consistent for approximately 10 seconds before a change in the headlights is activated. For example, during daylight hours, the headlights would not turn on due to the momentary darkness of driving under a bridge or through a short tunnel. nor does it turn on the exterior lights for driving conditions such as heavy rain or fog (however in some newer versions of the system, Twilight Sentinel is linked to GM's RainSense automatic windshield wiper system to turn lights on automatically when the wipers are on). Twilight Sentinel was first offered exclusively on the 1955 Cadillac lineup but was expanded to other divisions in the early 1960s. A related feature offered on many General Motors models during the 1950s and 1960s was the Autronic Eye headlight dimming system (which did just that). Cadillac later referred to its automatic dimming system as \\"Guidematic Headlamp Control\\" which encompassed Twilight Sentinel and Dimming Sentinel controls. (See Discussion Page) Ford Motor Company offers a nearly identical exterior lights on/off/delay shut-off system called \\"AutoLamp\\".

Prisoner abuse can include physical abuse, psychological abuse, sexual abuse, torture, or other acts such as refusal of essential medication.Prisoner Abuse Law & Legal Definition. USLegal. Retrieved from http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/prisoner-abuse/  Physical abuse  Physical abuse of prisoners includes illicit beating and hitting of prisoners, unlawful corporal punishment, stress positions, and excessive or prolonged physical restraining. According to the New York Times, along with physical abuse, prisoners are being thrown into jail for mental illnesses that they obtain and not being treated for them. This causes their issues to get worse and in some cases never get better. Also, relating to physical abuse the mentally ill can be thrown into restrained areas for a long amount of time because of their mental condition, this means that these mentally ill people do not have the resources to get better in the jail. This is also caused by overpopulation in jails. Penal Reform International claims, that overcrowding in the main source of poor jail conditions globally. This caused overcrowding and understaffing: one of the reasons why there can sometimes be 2-3 people in the same jail cell for a long period of time. This causes a lack of privacy and because the jails are so overcrowded some minor cases are cut from the justice system altogether. According to the Marshall Plan, there are also many gangs that are formed in different prisons which cause chaos and force the jail to go through many lockdowns which are a vulnerable time for the prison guards especially when they are understaffed. It also says that the prisoners and the prison guards have to be safe, which caused the guards to be defensive and sometimes abusive.  Psychological abuse  Psychological abuse of prisoners can include verbal abuse, sleep deprivation, white noise, pointless/absurd or humiliating instructions, recurrent exhaustive inspections and shakedowns, arbitrary strip searches, and denuding actions. According to Reflexions, prison can alter people's bodily dimensions, their emotional wellbeing, and possibly change their perception for an extended amount of time. It also claims that not only does the prison environment make mental disorders worse, but it also may cause them. The type of prison environment can be cruel and if the prisoner does not have the mental, emotional, and physical willpower they will struggle very greatly. =White noise= The endless playing of random static (similar to that of unused TV frequencies) with no pattern; this can cause extreme discomfort and disorientation. =Verbal abuse= Prisoners may be subject to taunting, heckling, profanity, and malicious lies by prison authorities. Guards and other authorities may use verbal abuse as a means of frightening or demoralizing prisoners to make them more compliant, or simply out of sadism. =Enablement of sexual violence= Prisoners are sometimes intentionally housed with inmates known to have raped other prisoners, or protection from known rapists may be purposely withheld from the prisoners. These practices create a very high incidence of rape in US prisons, which was the topic of the 2001 report No Escape from Human Rights Watch. Sexual abuse Sexual abuse of prisoners can include excessive vaginal or rectal contraband searches or other internal checks, forced sexual intercourse, forced insertion of objects into vagina or rectum, arbitrary strip searches, and other forms of forced denudation. =Strip searches= The experience of a forced strip search can be experienced as a traumatic event similarly to that of rape especially by female prisoners. The prevalence of CCTV in prisons and the generally indiscreet nature of strip searches, with often a number of guards observing, can add to the experienced humiliation. Strip searches are often arbitrarily used under various pretences, when the actual ambition is to assert control or to intimidate the subjected prison inmates. =Enemas= Forced enemas are commonly acknowledged as being uncomfortable and degrading for the receiving person. Such a treatment can also be registered as a form of physical abuse as well as sexual abuse, if practiced against the will of the prisoner. This is usually done in order to demonstrate dominance and assert \\"total control\\" over detainees. As a consequence of this practice, anal fissures, chronic hemorrhoids and rectal prolapse can occur when administered excessively. Forced enemas have evidentially been used for example at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp by the United States. In certain cases it was administered under the pretence to counter a prisoner's dehydration. Forms of medical justification were employed whenever enemas were in fact used as a coercive tool. Despite the pretext of medical need, it was later admitted in certain cases, that this was in fact untrue. The CIA administered enemas to Khalid Sheik Mohammed, Mustafa al-Hawsawi and Mohammed al-Qahtani among others. Torture Torture of prisoners includes any act, whether physical or psychological, which is deliberately done to inflict excruciating and agonizing pain upon a person under the actor's custody or physical control for any reason such as extracting information or punishment. =Enhanced interrogation= \\"Enhanced interrogation\\" is a euphemism for U.S. torture methods implemented in the War on Terror purportedly needed to extract information from detainees. Examples include use of stress positions, sleep deprivation, starvation, thirst, and sexual humiliation.

A corps of volunteers led by Giuseppe Garibaldi sailed from Quarto, near Genoa (now Quarto dei Mille) and landed in Marsala, Sicily, in order to conquer the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, ruled by the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. The project was an ambitious and risky venture aiming to conquer, with a thousand men, a kingdom with a larger regular army and a more powerful navy. The expedition was a success and concluded with a plebiscite that brought Naples and Sicily into the Kingdom of Sardinia, the last territorial conquest before the creation of the Kingdom of Italy on 17 March 1861. The sea venture was the only desired action that was jointly decided by the \\"four fathers of the nation\\" Giuseppe Mazzini, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Victor Emmanuel II, and Camillo Cavour, pursuing divergent goals. However, the Expedition was instigated by Francesco Crispi, who utilized his political influence to bolster the Italian unification project. The various groups participated in the expedition for a variety of reasons: for Garibaldi, it was to achieve a united Italy; to the Sicilian bourgeoisie, an independent Sicily as part of the kingdom of Italy, and for common people, land distribution and the end of oppression. Background The events of the Expedition took place within the overall process of the unification of Italy, which was largely orchestrated by Camillo Cavour, Prime Minister of Sardinia- Piedmont, as his life's work. After the annexation of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, the Duchies of Modena and Parma and the Romagna to Piedmont in March 1860, Italian nationalists set their sights on the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, which comprised all of southern mainland Italy and Sicily, as the next step toward their dream of unification of all Italian lands. In 1860 Garibaldi, already the most famous Italian revolutionary leader, was in Genoa planning an expedition against Sicily and Naples, with the covert support of the United Kingdom.Del Boca, Maledetti Savoia Sicilian leaders, among them Francesco Crispi, were discontented with Neapolitan rule over the island. Moreover, Britain was worried by the approaches of the Neapolitans towards the Russian Empire in the latter's attempt to open its way to the Mediterranean Sea; the strategic importance of the Sicilian ports was also to be dramatically increased by the opening of the Suez Canal. It has been also suggested (by Lorenzo del Boca, among the others) that British support for Garibaldi's expedition was spurred by the necessity to obtain more favourable economic conditions for Sicilian sulfur, which was needed in great quantities for munitions.Lorenzo Del Boca, Maledetti Savoia, see chapter Il copyright inglese =Search for a casus belli= The Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont needed a presentable casus belli in order to attack the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. This was needed for the House of Savoy, which however never gave any declaration of war against the Bourbon kingdom, a necessary condition, since this was among the requirements presented to Cavour. The only occurrence that would have satisfied this requirement was an uprising from within. Such an event would have felt the alienation of the people to the dynasty that ruled in Naples and, particularly, the inability of Francis of Bourbon, to ensure, in forms acceptable public policy in their domains. Sicily, as shown by the history of the past decades, was fertile ground, and the liberal south, especially those returning after an amnesty granted by the young King, who worked in this direction for some time., I vinti del Risorgimento, Utet, Torino, 2004, p. 99., Storia delle Due Sicilie 1847‚Äì1861, Edizioni Trabant, 2009, p. 331. The expedition Red Shirt volunteers of the Thousand from Brescia, Lombardy (1860), hand-colored The steamship, Piemonte, one of the two steamships, that transported the Thousand to Sicily =The Red Shirts= In March 1860, exile Rosolino Pilo exhorted Giuseppe Garibaldi to take charge of an expedition to liberate Southern Italy from Bourbon rule. At first, Garibaldi was against it, but eventually agreed. By May 1860, Garibaldi had collected 1,089 volunteers for his expedition to Sicily. The largest number of volunteers came from Lombardy (434 volunteers), Other significant numbers of volunteers came from occupied Venetia (194 volunteers), Genoa (156 volunteers), and Tuscany (78 volunteers). There were about 45 Sicilian volunteers and 46 Neapolitan volunteers‚Äîbut only 11 from Rome and the Papal States. 33 foreigners joined the expedition, amongst them Istv√°n T√ºrr and three other Hungarians and 14 Italians from the Trentino of the Austrian Empire. The majority of the volunteers were students and artisans from the lower classes. The 1,089 volunteers were poorly armed with dated muskets and were dressed in a minimalist uniform‚Äîconsisting of a red shirt and grey trousers. During the night of 5 May, a small group led by Nino Bixio \\"seized\\" two steamships in Genoa from the Rubattino shipping company (which the ships were actually secretly granted by the company, but done in such approach to prevent taking any responsibility by plausible deniability) in order to transport the volunteers to Sicily. They took the two ships, which they had renamed Il Piemonte and Il Lombardo, to the nearby rocks at Quarto dei Mille, Genoa, where the volunteers (including Francesco Crispi's wife, Rosalia) embarked for Sicily. =Landing in Sicily= Francesco Crispi The ships were then accompanied by the British Royal Navy which consisted of HMS Hannibal followed by the gunboats Argus and Intrepid under the command of Admiral Rodney Mundy. They landed at Marsala, on the westernmost point of Sicily, on 11 May. With British ships present in the harbour thus deterred the Bourbon ships from interfering.These were: Stromboli (steam corvette), Valoroso (brigandine), Partenope (sail frigate) and the armed steamer Capri. The Lombardo was attacked and sunk only after the disembarkation had been completed, while the Piemonte was captured. The landing had been preceded by the arrival of Francesco Crispi and others, who had the task of gaining the support of the locals for the volunteers. On 14 May, at Salemi, Garibaldi announced that he was assuming dictatorship over Sicily in the name of King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia. =Calatafimi and Palermo= The Mille won a first battle at Calatafimi against around 2,000 Neapolitan troops on 15 May. The battle boosted the morale of the Mille and, at the same time, depressed the Neapolitans, who were poorly led by their often corrupted higher officers, and started to feel themselves abandoned. Having promised land to every male who volunteered to fight against the Bourbons the ranks of the Mille enlarged to 1,200 with local men. On 27 May, with the help of a popular insurrection, the Mille laid siege to Palermo, the island's capital. The city was defended by some 16,000 men, but these were under the confused and timid direction of general Ferdinando Lanza, aged 75 (probably one of the Neapolitan officers bribed with English money). While two columns of Garibaldines attacked the perimeter, part of the population, strengthened by 2,000 prisoners liberated from the local jails, rose against the garrison. When his troops were driven back from most of their positions, Lanza ordered them to bombard the city for three days, causing the deaths of 600 civilians. By 28 May Garibaldi controlled much of the city and declared the Bourbon authority deposed. The following day a desperate Neapolitan counteroffensive was driven back, and Lanza asked for a truce. However, when a reinforcement party of well equipped and well trained troops arrived in the city, the situation became very serious for Garibaldi, who was saved only by Lanza's decision to surrender. Through the mediation of a British admiral, an armistice was signed and the Neapolitan fleet abandoned the port.

The Bourbon troops were ordered to retreat eastwards and evacuate the island. An insurrection that had broken out in Catania on 31 May, led by Nicola Fabrizi, was crushed by the local garrison, but the order to leave for Messina meant that this Neapolitan tactical success would have no practical results. At the time only Syracuse, Augusta, Milazzo and Messina remained in royal hands in Sicily. In the meantime Garibaldi issued his first law. A levy failed to muster more than 20,000 troops, while the peasants, who hoped to an immediate relief from the grievous conditions to which they were forced by the landowners, revolted in several localities. At Bronte, on 4 August 1860, Garibaldi's friend Nino Bixio bloodily repressed one of these revolts with two battalions of Redshirts. The pace of Garibaldi's victories had worried Cavour, who in early July sent him a proposal of immediate annexation of Sicily to Piedmont. Garibaldi, however, refused vehemently to allow such a move until the end of the war. Cavour's envoy, La Farina, was arrested and expelled from the island. He was replaced by the more malleable Agostino Depretis, who gained Garibaldi's trust and was appointed as pro- dictator. On 25 June 1860, King Francis II of the Two Sicilies had issued a constitution. However, this late attempt to conciliate his moderate subjects failed to rouse them to defend the regime, while liberals and revolutionaries were eager to welcome Garibaldi. At the time, Garibaldi had created the Esercito Meridionale (\\"Southern Army\\"), reinforced by other volunteers from Italy and some regular Piedmontese soldiers disguised as \\"deserters\\". The Neapolitans had mustered some 24,000 men for the defence of Messina and the other fortresses. On 20 July Garibaldi attacked Milazzo with 5,000 men. The Neapolitan defence was gallant, but again the absence of coordination and the refusal of Marshal Clary, commander-in-chief of the army in the island, to send reinforcements from Messina granted the Mille another victory. Six days later Clary surrendered the city of Messina to Garibaldi, leaving only 4,000 in the citadel and other forts. The other strongholds surrendered by the end of September. =Landing and conquest in Calabria= On 19 August Garibaldi's men disembarked in Calabria, a move opposed by Cavour, who had written the Dictator a letter urging him to not cross the strait. Garibaldi, however, disobeyed, an act which had the silent approval of King Victor Emmanuel. The Bourbons had some 20,000 men in Calabria, but, apart from some episodes like that of Reggio Calabria, which was conquered at high cost by Bixio on 21 August, they offered insignificant resistance, as numerous units of the Bourbon army disbanded spontaneously or even joined Garibaldi's ranks. On 30 August a conspicuous Sicilian army, led by general Ghio, was officially disbanded at Soveria Mannelli, while only minor and dispersed units continued the fight. The Neapolitan fleet behaved in a similar way. =The end= King Francis II was thus forced to abandon Naples and entrench himself in the formidable fortress of Gaeta, while a last stand was set up on the Volturno river, north of Naples. On 7 September Garibaldi took possession of Naples with little harm (he entered the city by train), hailed as a liberator by the population. In the meantime the Kingdom of Sardinia invaded the Papal States conquering Central Italy (Lazio excluded) through few battles such as the Battle of Castelfidardo, and entered the Kingdom of Two Sicilies joining Giuseppe Garibaldi. In the indecisive Battle of the Volturnus (1 and 2 OctoberEffective date of the end of the fightings is debated.), Garibaldi, with a force of 24,000 men, was not able to conclusively defeat the Neapolitan Army (about 25,000 men). Only the arrival of the Sardinian army obliged the last organized Bourbon force to entrench in Gaeta. A few days later (21 October) a plebiscite confirmed the annexation of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies to the Kingdom of Sardinia by an overwhelming majority. The end of the expedition is traditionally set with the famous meeting in TeanoOther sources (including Del Boca) set the location of the meeting at , in territory of the modern comune of Vairano Patenora. (northern Campania) between Victor Emmanuel and Garibaldi (26 October 1860). Others assign instead the end of the campaign to the King's entrance into Naples on 7 November. However, the military campaign was not yet fully completed, as Francis II held out in Gaeta until February of the next year, when he finally surrendered to the Sardinian army led by Enrico Cialdini, and left for exile in the Papal States. Shortly thereafter, in March 1861, the new Kingdom of Italy (Regno d'Italia) was formally established. Garibaldi asked the King to remain in the former Two Sicilies for a year as dictator. He also asked that his officers be integrated in the new Italian Army. When Victor Emmanuel refused to grant the dictator his request but agreed to integrate the men and officers, he returned to Caprera.

In the following years, the rise of local resistance (the so-called brigantaggio or brigandage), required at one point the presence of some 140,000 Piedmontese troops to maintain control of the former Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Traditionally, the handling of the brigantaggio has received a negative judgement by Italian historians, in strict contrast with the heroism attributed to Garibaldi and his followers; the English historian Denis Mack Smith,Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy. for example, points out the deficiencies and reticence of the sources available for the period 1861‚Äì1946,Denis Mack Smith, I re d'Italia, Rizzoli, 1990 but the same historian also pointed out the backwardness of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies at the time of the unification.Italy: a modern history ‚Äì Denis Mack Smith ‚ÄìUniversity of Michigan ‚Äì 1959 ‚Äì page 3 \\"This difference between North and South was fundamental. A peasant from Calabria had little in common with one from Piedmont, and Turin was infinitely more like Pans and London than Naples and Palermo, for these two halves were on quite different levels of civilization. Poets might write of the South as the garden of the world, the land of Sybaris and Capri, and stay-at-home politicians sometimes believed them; but in fact most southerners lived in squalor, afflicted by drought, malaria, and earthquakes. The Bourbon rulers of Naples and Sicily before 1860 had been staunch supporters of a feudal system glamorized by the trappings of a courtly and corrupt society. They had feared the traffic of ideas and had tried to keep their subjects insulated from the agricultural and industrial revolutions of northern Europe. Roads were scanty or nonexistent, and passports necessary even for internal travel. In the 'annus mirabilis' of 1860 these backward regions were conquered by Garibaldi and annexed by plebiscite to the North.\\" ‚ÄîItaly: a modern history, Denis Mack Smith, page 3 The expedition, moreover, obtained the support of the powerful great landowners of southern Italy in exchange for the promise that their properties be left intact in the upcoming political settlement. Numerous Sicilian peasants, however, had joined the Mille hoping instead for a redistribution of the land to the people working it. The consequences of this misunderstanding became evident at Bronte.

Managerial career After a spell coaching the Bristol City youth team between 1974 and 1978, where he was part of the backroom staff that won promotion to the then English First Division, he began his management career in Denmark with N√∏rresundby managing the local side Norresundby, gaining promotion in his first season there. He returned to Scotland in 1980 when he was appointed manager of Dundee, winning promotion to the Scottish Premier Division with the club, again in his first season in charge. After several high-profile departures from the Dundee first team, Mackay eventually left the club in 1983. After a short time away from the game, Bobby Gould approached him to be his assistant at Coventry City. Bobby was sacked after a poor run of results and Don was asked to take charge, where the club staved off relegation by famously winning their last three games of the season, to retain their First Division Status. Following the sack at Coventry, Mackay went to work as reserve-team coach at Rangers, alongside ex playing colleague Walter Smith and the manager Graeme Souness. Despite a successful spell at Rangers, Mackay wanted to manage in his own right, and therefore moved onto Blackburn Rovers. They narrowly missed the play-offs in his first season in charge, but did win the Full Members Cup, beating First Division Chelsea, Oxford United and Charlton Athletic along the way. In the next two seasons at Blackburn they made the play offs, losing out on promotion both times. Following a relatively poor final season in charge (1990‚Äì91), he was relieved of his position early in the next season and went on to manage Fulham. His first season at Fulham was promising but results deteriorated the following year and following a defeat at Leyton Orient he was dismissed, results did not improve and Fulham were eventually relegated to the Fourth Division. Mackay then worked as a scout for Arsenal, where he discovered the young Freddie Ljungberg. Mackay then had a stint as chief scout of St Johnstone. He then teamed up with Steve Archibald at Airdrie. Despite the financial difficulties experienced by the club, they won the Scottish Challenge Cup in their only season in charge. He was employed by Middlesbrough as a scout from December 2001 through to June 2007, before moving to join Leicester City under Martin Allen. His role as sporting director was short- lived, however. Playing career He was a goalkeeper and played for Forfar Athletic and made 104 appearances. He was then signed for Dundee United by Jerry Kerr, for whom he made 243 appearances. This is still the second most appearances made by a goalkeeper for Dundee Utd, behind keeping legend Hamish McAlpine. He was then given a free transfer by Jim McLean, after ten years of loyal service to the Utd cause, where he finished his 16-year professional playing career with Southend United after 13 appearances.

The trail then turns right and follows the shoreline into Royal Victoria Country Park. The path exits the Country Park next to the tearooms and twists and turns along a short nature trail until it meets the Hamble Rail Trail. The path continues North along Hound Road then crosses farmland, turns right at a recreation ground, and returns to the railway station via the outskirts of Bursledon. There are numerous pay car parks in the area, however it is recommended that walkers use the free car park just off Mortimer Road near Botley High Street. In summer a ferry service operates between Hamble and Manor Farm Country Park.

The present teacher is Gurinder Singh, who lives with his family at the main centre in northern India. The main centre of RSSB is at Dera Baba Jaimal Singh Ji, located on the banks of the Beas River, in the northern India state of Punjab. Although RSSB is not defined as a religion, the organization's fundamental teachings are not in direct conflict with those of other world faiths. RSSB was founded in India in 1891 and steadily began spreading to other countries. Today, RSSB holds satsangs or teachings in more than 90 countries worldwide. It is a non-profit organisation with no affiliation to any political or commercial organizations. It owns a number of properties worldwide called Science of the Soul Study Centres, where meetings are held. The centres are constructed and maintained primarily by volunteers. The group teaches a personal path of spiritual development which includes a vegetarian diet, abstinence from intoxicants, a moral way of life and the practice of daily meditation. There are no rituals, ceremonies, hierarchies or mandatory contributions, nor are there compulsory gatherings. Members do not need to give up their cultural identity or religious preference to follow this path. Name Radha Soami is a Hindi expression meaning \\"Lord of the Soul\\" in English. Satsang means 'association with Truth' and describes a group that seeks truth. Beliefs At the core of the RSSB beliefs is that there is a spiritual purpose to human life, to experience the divinity of God who resides within all of us. It is through this experience that we will realize the truth that there is only one God and we are all expressions of his love. Central to the RSSB philosophy is a spiritual teacher who explains the purpose of life and guides and instructs members in a method of spirituality based on a daily meditation practice. By performing the meditation practice according to the teacher's instructions, individuals can realize the presence of God within themselves. It is a solitary practice that is done in the quiet of one's own home. Members commit themselves to a way of life that supports spiritual growth while carrying out their responsibilities to family, friends and society. To build on the primary spiritual practice of meditation, members are lacto-vegetarian, abstain from alcohol and recreational drugs, and are expected to lead a life of high moral values. The lacto-vegetarian diet encourages respect and empathy for all life and acknowledges that there is a debt to be paid for taking any life both necessarily and unnecessarily. Abstaining from intoxicants improves one's ability to concentrate and calms the mind during meditation. Members are encouraged to be self-supporting and not be a burden on society. They are free to make their own choices in life and maintain any cultural or religious affiliations they choose. RSSB does not involve itself in the personal lives of its members. None of the Radha Soami teaching suggests the change of one's religion.

He stood for the Green Party in the 1989 general election, and was elected to represent Dublin South, becoming the party's first ever TD. Garland lost his seat in the 1992 general election with a dramatic fall in his vote, dropping from 8.8% in 1989 to 3.8%, which was among the lowest votes for a sitting TD. At the 1994 European Parliament election, Garland backed an independent Green candidate Peter Sweetman, over the official Green candidate, Nuala Ahern, in the Leinster constituency. Ahern went on to win the seat, to the surprise of many, and an attempt was made to throw Garland out of the party for his disloyalty, including vote in a specially convened party council. Following the 2007 general election Garland was one of the leading internal critics of the Greens' decision to enter coalition with Fianna F√°il.

It is a member of the European University Association, the European Access Network, Association of Commonwealth Universities, the Utrecht Network, the Santander Network, the Compostela Group, the European Association for University Lifelong Learning (EUCEN) and the International Student Exchange Programme (ISEP). In post-nominals the University's name is abbreviated as Melit; a shortened form of Melita (a Latinised form of the Greek ŒúŒµŒªŒØœÑŒ∑).  History  Old University Building in Valletta The precursor to the University of Malta was the Collegium Melitense, a Jesuit college which was set up on 12 November 1592. This was originally located in an old house in Valletta, but a purpose-built college was constructed between 1595 and 1597. This building is now known as the Old University Building or the Valletta Campus. The Jesuits were expelled from Malta in 1768, and although their property was taken over by the Treasury of the Order of St. John, the college remained open and professors retained their posts. The University of Malta officially came to existence on 22 November 1769, when Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca signed a decree constituting a Pubblica Universit√† di Studi Generali. The University was briefly suspended during the magistracy of Francisco Ximenes de Texada in the 1770s, but it was reconstituted by his successor Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc in 1779. The University was replaced by the √âcole Centrale during the French occupation of Malta from 1798 to 1800, but was once again reopened by the British in the early 19th century. From 1937 to 1974, the institution was known as the Royal University of Malta. Over time, the Valletta campus became too small and Evans Laboratories (now known as Evans Building) was built in 1959 to house the Faculty of Science. In 1968, the Medical School moved to a building near St. Luke's Hospital in Gwardamanƒ°a. The University opened a much larger campus at Tal-Qroqq in Msida in the late 1960s, but it retained the Valletta building which is still used for some lectures and conferences. The university is a member of the European University Association, the European Access Network, the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the Utrecht Network, the Santander Network, the Compostela Group, the European Association for University Lifelong Learning (EUCEN) the International Student Exchange Programme (ISEP) and the Excellence Network of Island Universities [RETI]. The university has participated in EU programmes and has won several projects in collaboration with partner universities. University of Malta staff and students participate in programmes such as Erasmus and Leonardo. The university acts as a partner with other institutions. Links have been forged with the Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise & Industry and the Employment & Training Corporation in order to determine how the university, industry, business and the public sector can develop links.  Campuses  = Msida campus = University of Malta campus The main campus of the University of Malta is located in an area known as Tal-Qroqq in Msida. It has a total area of , and it houses most of the university's faculties, centres and institutions. Plans to construct this campus began in the late 1950s after the university's original premises in Valletta were deemed too small. Designs for the new campus were prepared by the British architectural practice Norman and Dawbarn in 1961, and the Maltese architectural firm Mortimer and de Giorgio was also involved in the project. The foundation stone of the campus was laid down on 22 September 1964, a day after Malta's independence, by Commonwealth Secretary Duncan Sandys and construction was completed by 1970. The design was inspired by American college campuses, and it contains separate buildings for each faculty, along with a library and a University House, surrounded by a ring road. One of the most significant buildings in the university campus is the former Department of Architecture Building (now known as the ƒ†u≈º√® Cassar Pullicino Building), a Brutalist building designed by the British architect Peter Richardson and built in 1969‚Äì70. The university campus has been extended several times since its original construction in the late 1960s. A Catholic chapel dedicated to St Thomas More was added in 1977‚Äì78, and it was built to designs of the architect Lino Gatt, with the architect William Micallef supervising its construction. In the late 1980s the architect Richard England was commissioned to design a new masterplan for the university, and he designed a number of new Postmodern buildings, many of which are linked together with colonnades, arcades, stairs or ramps. This extension was built between 1989 and 1999, and its most significant component is the Gateway Building which serves as the university's main entrance. The Faculty of ICT is housed in a steel-and-glass building which was constructed between 2009 and 2013. A masterplan for future development of the campus has been prepared, and it includes a proposed Sustainable Living Complex which would house the Faculty for the Built Environment. A building which will serve as accommodation for university students is currently under construction in an area between the main campus and Mater Dei Hospital, after it was approved by the Planning Authority in 2018. The International Maritime Law Institute (IMLI) is located within the grounds of the university's Msida campus even though it is a separate educational institution. = Valletta campus = The Valletta campus is the university's original campus, located in Malta's capital city. It is housed in the Old University Building, which was constructed between 1595 and 1602 to house the university's predecessor, the Collegium Melitense. The Valletta campus incorporates an Aula Magna (\\"Great Hall\\"). The campus is used to host events such as international conferences and seminars, along with a number of short courses and summer schools. It currently houses the Research, Innovation & Development Trust (RIDT), the Conferences & Events Unit and the Centre for the Study & Practice of Conflict Resolution. = Marsaxlokk campus = The Marsaxlokk campus houses the university's Institute for Sustainable Energy.

In addition, he feared Motonaga who had got credit and killed him next year. After that, Harumoto ruled the whole area of Kinai (Yamashiro Province, Yamato Province, Kawachi Province, Izumi Province and Settsu Province) and took hold of the Ashikaga shogunate as the Kanrei. In 1543, Hosokawa Ujitsuna who was the foster son of Takakuni, raised his armies, and in 1549, Miyoshi Nagayoshi who was a dominant retainer and the first son of Motonaga betrayed Harumoto and took side with Ujitsuna. Because of that, Harumoto was defeated. Harumoto, Ashikaga Yoshiteru who was the 13th Ashikaga sh≈çgun and Ashikaga Yoshiharu who was the father of Yoshiteru were purged to ≈åmi Province.
