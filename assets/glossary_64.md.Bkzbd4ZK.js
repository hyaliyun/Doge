Early history In the 1890s John Marston's Sunbeam had become extremely successful by relying on high quality of production and finish. But Marston was dissatisfied with the pedals on his machines, which he bought in. In 1890 he dispatched his son Charles to the US on a selling trip, but included in his instructions that Charles must discuss pedal engineering with Pratt and Whitney in Hartford, Connecticut and come back with a high-class pedal and the machinery for making it. Charles said that the Villiers Engineering Co. was \\"the ultimate fruit\\" of his trip to the US, being impressed by the production system and the labour saving devices. He pointed out that \\"it was not possible to develop these at Sunbeamland, which had long been working on another plan, but it was possible to start them in a new factory\\". As a result of the tour, in 1898, John Marston bought a small Japanning works based in Villiers Street, Wolverhampton. Under the direction of Charles, the company made cycle parts for the Sunbeam company. As the factory was producing more parts than Sunbeam required, it sold components to other manufacturers. 1902 was a momentous year for Villiers. Firstly, John Marston sold the company to his son Charles for ¬£6,000 on a loan against future profits. Secondly, it developed and patented the cycle free-wheel, which every cycle manufacturer required. The production of free wheels reached its peak just after the Second World War, as the company produced 80,000 per week or 4 million per year. Production pre First World War Apart from the production of freewheels outlined above, the company produced its first engine in early 1912, a 350 cc four-stroke complete with integral two-speed gearbox. Later that year it developed a 269 cc two- stroke (70mm bore and stroke) and the simplcity of this engine and attractive price made it a rapid success. During 1913 the Sun-Villers motorcycle was launched manufactured by the Sun Cycle & Fittings Co. By 1914 the Villiers 269 cc 2-stroke engine had been adopted by a large number of motorcycle manufacturers, such as the Allday (Alldays & Onions), The Royal Ruby, The New Ryder, the Bown-Villiers, the Coventry-Eagle, the Gerrard, Sparkbrook, the Invicta (A. Barnett & Co), the Ixion, the Juno, and the Roulette.\\"55 two- stroke and lightweight motorcycles\\", Motor Cycle, 23 July 1914 In spite of the huge success of the 269 cc two-stroke, the four-stroke engine had not completely been shelved, as in October 1914, J.H Motors of Oldham announced\\"Latest Designs\\", Motor Cycle, 15 October 1914, pp436-437 two motorcycles, the No.1 fitted with a 2.75 hp Villiers four-stroke engine of 349 cc (74.5 x 80 mm bore and stroke), and a 2.5 hp two-stroke model using the Villiers 269 cc engine. Whether many of either model were made before war orders halted production in 1915 is unclear. Other manufacturers known to use Villiers engines up to 1915 include the Campion, The Hobart,\\"For Sale 1915 Hobart-Villiers\\", Motor Cycle, 6 July 1916, Advertisements P26 the Chater-Lea, the Diamond, and the Excelsior. Production during World War One During World War One, in common with many firms not directly involved in making military transport, the Villiers factory changed to production of munitions, in particular fuses for 75mm shells. Companies engaged in war work still worked on new models anticipating the end of the war, with Villiers applying for 16 engine-related patents during the war. One particular issue was a generic problem ‚Äì the fact that before the war most engines relied on German- made magnetos for ignition, which caused a major issue during the war. In January 1917 Villiers patented their solution to this problem ‚Äì the flywheel- magneto, which became a standard feature of their engines.'Improvements in or relating to Magneto-devices for Internal-combustion Engines', Patent GB111391, 31-1-1917 Production in the inter-war years Immediately after the war Villiers picked up where they had left off, with supply of the 269 cc engine, now as the Mark II engine with different method of attaching the exhaust. By 1919 the bikes that used the Villiers engines included the Excelsior lightweight, the Diamond (D.F.& M. Engineering Co), the Royal Ruby, the Wolf Lightweight (Wulfruna Engineering), the Carfield, the Ruffells, the P.V. (Elliston & Fell), the Sparkbrook, the Yvel, the P&S; lightweight (Pearson and Sopwith), the Chater-Lea, the Campion, the Victoria (of Glasgow), the Hobart, the Olympic, the Ixion, the Bown-Villiers, the Wilkin, and the Saltley. The engine remained much the same, and continued to use a separate magneto, though it did have an oil pump to provide crankcase and piston lubrication via a hollow crankcase bolt ‚Äì a design that Villiers had patented during 1914/1915.'Improvements in Oil Supply Systems for Crank Chambers and the like', Patent GB191509423, 1915 1926 Villiers 300 cc engine The Mark III engine embodied some changes to crankcase and brushes in 1919/1920, and in March 1920 the new Villiers Mark IV engine complete with flywheel magneto was revealed.\\"A New Flywheel Magneto\\", The Motor Cycle, 25 March 1920, p363 In May 1920 a new British Excelsior lightweight model was announced, this being the first motorcycle to show the new Villiers engine using the flywheel-magneto instead of a separate magneto.\\"New Machines and an Old Name\\", The Motor Cycle, 13 May 1920, p540 In September 1922 Villiers announced the details of their new 1923 engine range,\\"Three Sizes of Villiers Engine\\", The Motor Cycle, 28 September 1922, pp437-438 which included 147 cc, 250 cc and 343 cc engines. These engines featured a radial-finned cylinder head, with both the inlet and exhaust port being at the front of the engine, and they all had the Villiers flywheel-magneto. While the 147 cc relied on petrol-oil mixture for crankshaft lubrication, the two larger engines used a separate oil-feed system. The new 250 cc engine produced 25 per cent more power than the older 269 cc engine. In 1926 Villiers introduced an even smaller engine, the 125 cc with twin exhaust ports and side-mounted carburettor, and in 1927 they introduced the 344 cc twin 2-stroke. Villiers were to go on to produce a wide range of single and twin cylinder 2-strokes primarily for motorcycle use. At the end of the 1920s they also started producing engines for stationary use, with the first model being the water-cooled WX11 and in 1933 the air-cooled Mar-vil. Villiers engines were also used in lawn mowers, for example the 147 cc engine was used in the Atco mowers of the 1920s and in 1931 it was joined by a 98 cc Villiers engine, known as the Midget. The Villiers company also had links to the Seagull outboard marine engines, both of which owed their existence to John Marston. The Seagull engines used the Villiers flywheel magneto, and a 'Seagull-Villiers' carburetor. In 1936, L. E. Baynes and Sir John Carden, trading as Carden-Baynes Aircraft of Heston Aerodrome, launched the Carden- Baynes Auxiliary, a light aircraft which was essentially a motorized Abbott- Baynes Scud 3 glider. This carried a retractable 249 cc Villiers engine driving a push-propeller and producing 9 bhp, and the fuel tank held enough to run the engine for thirty minutes. The 249 cc Carden-Baynes Auxiliary is believed to be the lowest-powered aircraft in the history of powered flight. Production during the Second World War During the war part of Villiers production was again turned to fuses for shells, with over 10 million produced, although they continued to make engines and cycleparts. Their engines were also used in small motorcycles designed for air drop with paratroopers ‚Äì the Excelsior Welbike and the James ML paratrooper's machine known as the Clockwork Mouse. Post-war production In 1956, Villiers produced its two millionth engine and presented it to the Science Museum in London. In 1957 Villiers absorbed JA Prestwich Industries, makers of the J.A.P. engines. In 1962 the company were claiming that: > \\"jointly the two companies produce a vast range of two-stroke and four- > stroke petrol engines and four-stroke diesel engines from 1/3 to 16 b.h.p. > These are the engines which power many of Britain's two-stroke motor cycles, > scooters and three wheelers, and the great majority of the motor mowers, > cultivators, concrete mixers, generating sets, elevators, pumping sets. > etc.\\" Villiers manufactured a range of single and twin two-stroke engines (from 98 cc to 325 cc) for light motorcycle and vehicle manufacturers until the 1960s. In the early 1960s, the company was taken over by Manganese Bronze Holdings, and in 1966 together with AMC became Norton-Villiers, and in 1972 merged with the BSA group to become Norton-Villiers-Triumph, which eventually went into liquidation in 1978.

A view of the forest from the Pichavaram viewing tower Sethiyathope Anicut Sethiyathope anicut was constructed in 1851 during the colonial period. This anicut was one of the oldest anicut in Tamil Nadu. This anicut was constructed on Vellar river, from this anicut many villages obtain revenue for their agriculture. In this river Vellar, the Veeranam Lake water also merges, from this river Sellar water flows to X-Road of Sethiyathope, Pinnalur, Karaimedu, Maruvai, Kolakudi, Boddampadi then reach entrance of Perumal lake near Kurinjipadi and Kullanchavadi a distance of 8km. On Maruvai the river's name was Paravanaaru River Bank. Veeranam lake Veeranam lake birth from Cauvery river place of Kollidam river lower anicut. Veeranam Lake was built in the Tenth century during the time of Greater Cholas, from 907‚Äì955 AD[1] and is a 16-kilometre (9.9 mi) long dam in northern Tamil Nadu. It was created by Rajaditya Chola. He named it after his father Parantaka I Chola, who had the title \\"Veeranarayanan\\". Veera Narayanapuram modified into Veeranam over time. Veeranam lake gets water from Kollidam via Vadavaru River. The lake remains dry for the major part of the year. Water released from the Mettur dam through Kollidam and Lower Anicut would also bring in sufficient inflow into the Veeranam Lake. The lake received sufficient inflow in April enabling supply to the city for three months. With heavy rain in Western Ghats, the lake almost got its storage capacity as it received inflow from the Cauvery tributaries Bhavani and Amaravathi. The Veeranam Project The Veeranam project,[3] to supply water to Chennai, was conceived in 1967 by the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, C. N. Annadurai, and executed under his successor, M. Karunanidhi. The project was subject to rampant corruption and money earmarked for the project was lost, leading to stagnation of the project. The project's completion in 2004 by the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, J. Jayalalitha. It was impossible to use any water from the lake since it had run dry, and the face-saving proposal adopted by the authorities was to dig 45 deep borewells around the area and pump the resulting water 235 km (146 mi) to Chennai via the pipeline.[4] The length of the lake is 14 km and this is the largest lake in Tamil Nadu. The credit goes to ancient people who have done this job with ordinary hand-made tools. Perumal lake Perumal Aeri's irrigation covers around 1000 acres of agricultural land. Villages include Puduchatram, Alapakkam, Theerthanagiri, Thaanur, Samba Reddy Palayam, Aayi Thurai, Mettu Palayam, Pundiaan Kuppam, T. Kalaiyan Kuppan, and Kundiyamallur Aathi Narayanapuram. Overflow water is let through a channel to Sangolikuppam river. http://india- wris.nrsc.gov.in/wrpinfo/index.php?title=Sethiathope_Anicut_Major_Irrigation_Project_JI03383 References 2.http://www.townpanchayat.in/sethiyathope Category:Cities and towns in Cuddalore district ","title":"Sethiathoppu"},{"id":"5809114","text":"Sevilimedu is a town in Kancheepuram district in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

It must have been about tall at the back. These measures would make Brontornis the fifth-heaviest bird found thus far, after Vorombe titan, Dromornis stirtoni and Aepyornis maximus, and Pachystruthio dmanisensis. A comparison of the tarsometatarsi of two B. burmeisteri specimens, FM-P13259 and MLP-91 (lectotype), both coming from the same geographical region and geological formation, shows them as not to present any anatomical differences, apart from size, where in the first is around one third smaller than the second. The idea is that they are examples of intraspecific variation, possibly sexual dimorphism. There is the possibility that they represent two species.  Discovery  Life reconstruction Fossils of the terror bird have been found in the Santa Cruz and Monte Le√≥n Formations in Argentina. It is known from bones, mainly of the legs and feet but also portions of some skulls and backbone, found in several localities of Santa Cruz Province. It coexisted with some slightly smaller and more active phorusrhacids like Phorusrhacos.  Classification  Recent work has cast doubt on the hypothesis that Brontornis is a phorusrhacid. Brontornis may actually represent an anseriform, with other genera traditionally assigned to Brontornithinae (Physornis and Paraphysornis) being true phorusrhacids. The subfamily containing the latter two had been proposed to be renamed to Physornithinae, with Physornis fortis as the type species. If these conclusions are valid, this would mean that there are three groups of giant basal anseriformes, in chronological order of divergence: the gastornithids (Gastornis and kin), Brontornis, and finally the mihirungs of Australia.Agnolin, 2007Buffetaut, 2014 However, other analyses have also argued that Brontornis exhibits thoracic vertebrae diagnostic of phorusrhacids, supporting its placement within that group.Alvarenga et al., 2011  References   Bibliography    * Category:Brontornithinae Category:Miocene birds of South America Category:Burdigalian life Category:Langhian life Category:Serravallian life Category:Laventan Category:Colloncuran Category:Friasian Category:Santacrucian Category:Neogene Argentina Category:Fossils of Argentina Category:Fossil taxa described in 1891 ","title":"Brontornis"},{"id":"5809118","text":"Sevugampatti is a panchayat town in Dindigul district in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

It was located at Framnes in the town of Narvik, along the Ofotfjorden. It was operated by the state-owned Avinor and consisted of a runway aligned 01‚Äì19 (roughly north‚Äìsouth). The airport closed on 1 April 2017, due to the construction of the new H√•logaland bridge (opened December 2018) which shortened the journey to the larger Harstad-Narvik Airport, Evenes, making that the primary airport for Narvik. History Until its closure, the airport was served by Wider√∏e, who operate a public service obligation route to Bod√∏. Narvik is now only served by the primary Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes, capable of jetliner operations. The airport handled 27,142 passengers in 2012. Narvik was served by a seaplane service from 1935 to 1939 and from 1946 to 1971. Planning of Evenes started during the 1950s, but from the late 1968 Narvik Municipality proposed building both a regional and primary airport. Framnes was completed in 1972, a year before Evenes, and scheduled services started on 1 October 1975. The terminal building was completed in 1986 and the airport was nationalized in 1997. Wider√∏e has operated at the airport since the opening, except from 2003 to 2006, when the airport was served by Kato Air. Seaplanes The first scheduled airline service to Narvik was carried out by Norwegian Air Lines in 1935. Using a Junkers W 34, they flew a coastal route between Bergen and Troms√∏, which landed in Narvik. The route continued until 1939 when it was terminated because of the break-out of World War II. The route resumed in 1946, when it was flown with a Junkers Ju 52. The water aerodrome consisted of a floating pier in the port. Wider√∏e started flying to Narvik in 1951, at first flying via Svolv√¶r to Bod√∏. DNL's successor Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) terminated its seaplane routes the following year, leaving them to Wider√∏e, who operated the Noorduyn Norseman and de Havilland Canada Otter. The first scheduled airline service to Harstad and Narvik was carried out by Norwegian Air Lines (DNL) in 1935. Using a Junkers W 34, they flew a coastal route between Bergen and Troms√∏, with stops in Narvik and Harstad. The route continued until 1939 when it was terminated because of the break-out of World War II. The route resumed in 1946, when it was flown with a Junkers Ju 52. DNL also operated a direct service between Harstad and Narvik. Harstad's water aerodrome was located at Klubbeskj√¶ret in the town center. For a while there were discussion of moving it to Harstadbotn, but this was not carried out. Seaplane routes were only conducted during the summer.Steinnes: 477 Wider√∏e started flying to Narvik in 1951, at first flying via Svolv√¶r to Bod√∏. DNL's successor Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) terminated its seaplane routes the following year, leaving them to Wider√∏e, who operated the Noorduyn Norseman and de Havilland Canada Otter. Patronage at Harstad was 1,143 passengers in 1946, 2,725 the following year and 8,037 in 1959. The latter year saw 6,139 passengers at Narvik. Establishment The Harstad‚ÄìNarvik area had been proposed as a potential location of Bardufoss Air Station when it had been planned during the late 1930s. However, Bardufoss has been selected because of its favorable strategic location. About 1950 discussions started regarding construction of an airport between Bod√∏ and Troms√∏. In Narvik work started on planning an airport in Evenes, which was approved by Narvik Municipal Council in February 1951. However, it also considered several closer locations, such as Herjangfjellet, Elvg√•rdsmoen, H√•kvikvleira and Vidrek.Svendsen: 393 An important issue for Narvik was the necessary construction of the Rombak Bridge to cut travel time to Evenes.Steinnes: 479 The civilian sector at Bardufoss Airport opened in 1956. It served all of Troms√∏ as well as Ofoten. Travel time to Bardufoss was three hours (120 km and a ferry) from Narvik. A government committee which had received a mandate to consider future airports, concluded with a report on 16 December 1964. It recommended that nine more primary airports be built and that Evenes and Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget receive top priority. The committee noted SAS' introduction of the Sud Aviation Caravelle and wanted to build a network of airport capable of handling jetliners. It argued for Evenes as a good location that despite it being slightly closer to Harstad, Narvik would be closer to Bardufoss and have an advantage of it as a reserve airport. At a common meeting for eleven southern Troms and Ofoten municipalities on 11 May 1965, these unanimously supported Evenes. They establish a committee, which issued a report to the government in June 1966, which concluded that it would be possible to have an airport completed by 1968.Svendsen: 395 The airlines Braathens SAFE and Wider√∏e both launched an alternative proposal whereby the government instead should build a network of short take-off and landing airports. When H√•kon Kyllingmark was appointed Minister of Transport and Communications in 1965, he placed the primary airport construction plan on hold and instead focused on construction of regional airports. This caused local interest for airports at Kv√¶fjordeidet and Vidrek to resume, after initiative from Wider√∏e. Several commercial interest organizations in Narvik supported an airport at Vidrek, while their Harstad counterparts supported an airport at Evenes. Narvik Municipal Council continued to support Evenes until it was instead proposed as a regional airport. It voted in February 1968 to continue to support Evenes as a primary airport, but also work for a local airport in Narvik.Svendsen: 396 Planning of an airport at Vidrek started in 1968 and in early 1969 the company A/S Narvik Flyplass was established. Meetings were held with the ministry, where it was determined that planning would have to wait until further reports were made on the regional network in Nordland. Kyllingmark stated in 1970 that he intended to allow Narvik to receive a regional airport. The break-through for Narvik Airport came when the mining company LKAB, which exports its ore through Narvik, needed a place to dump earthwork. An agreement was made with the municipality whereby it received the earthwork free of charge and placed at a suitable location at Framneslia, a lot which was owned by LKAB. The municipal council approved in July 1971 plans to build a short take-off and landing airport at Framneslia, based on a thirteen-year free lease of the land. Government permission for a general aviation airport was issued in early 1972 and technical approval from the Civil Aviation Administration was granted in August.Svendsen: 397 Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes opened on 30 June 1973. At first Framnes only served general aviation, but in late 1974 Parliament approved that the airport be used for subsidized regional aviation. The airport started with scheduled traffic on 1 October 1975. The original terminal building was a residential house which had been in the way for the runway and moved to a suitable location. Initial services were provided by Wider√∏e using a 19-passenger de Havilland Canada Twin Otter with flights provided to Bod√∏ Airport; Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes; Svolv√¶r Airport, Helle and Stokmarknes Airport, Skagen. The airport handled 19,135 passengers in 1985. Operational history A new terminal opened on 24 September 1986; it cost 7 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which the state paid seventy-five percent and the remained was financed by local governments. The new terminal building was and the control tower was expanded with . The airport lacked a suitable garage for a fire truck, so a municipal fire engine had to be driven to the airport every time a plane landed. The upgraded terminal allowed Wider√∏e to start serving Narvik with the 50-passenger de Havilland Canada Dash 7. Wider√∏e Dash 8‚Äì100 Wider√∏e replaced their older aircraft with the Dash 8 between 1993 and 1995. The airport was taken over by the state and the Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor) on 1 January 1997. Routes to Narvik Airport, Framnes have been subject to public service obligation since 1 April 1997, with the first contract being won by Wider√∏e. In the third tender, which became operational on 1 April 2003, Kato Air won the bid to operate the route from Narvik to Bod√∏. In March 2004 they resigned the contract from 8 March 2005. The ministry subsequently issued a new tender, but no airlines bid. The ministry was forced to renegotiate the contract with Kato Air, which resulted in the subsidy for the last thirteen months increasing from NOK 8 to 18.2 million. The result of Kato Air taking over the route in 2003 was that the patronage had been halved. Wider√∏e recaptured the Narvik contract from 1 April 2006. In the tender valid from 1 April 2012 the routes to Svolv√¶r, Leknes, R√∏st and Narvik were awarded to Danish Air Transport. Two weeks before operations were to start the Civil Aviation Authority of Norway stated that DAT did not meet the safety requirements, resulting in Wider√∏e instead being awarded the contract. The main issue resolved around the installation of the SCAT-I landing system; the time from the tender was completed until the operations started was eight weeks, but it took eight months to install the system. DAT stated that the introduction of the SCAT-I-system had resulted in a de facto monopoly for Wider√∏e. DAT sued the ministry for breaching the tender rules, but lost the case. Closure The government supported the construction of H√•logaland Bridge on the condition that Narvik Airport, Framnes be closed. Minister of Transport Magnhild Meltveit Kleppa stated in 2010 that money saved on having to upgrade the runway safety area and the operating deficits of the airport and subsidies for the route could help finance the bridge, estimated to cost NOK 2.2 billion. The bridge will reduce the travel distance by road from Narvik to the Evenes by and 20 minutes, to and 55 minutes. Construction of the bridge started on 18 February 2013 and is scheduled for completion near the end of 2017. Wider√∏e, the only operator, decided to move the only line at Framnes (from Bod√∏) to Evenes airport on 1 April 2017, and increase its traffic there.Snart starter denne direkteruta opp Facilities The runway is and aligned 01‚Äì19, roughly north‚Äìsouth. The airport is located at Framnes, from the town center. The airport has taxis, car rental and paid parking for 40 vehicles. Airlines and destinations At the time of closure, the airport's only service was a Wider√∏e route to Bod√∏, operated using the Dash 8‚Äì100. The route was subsidized through a public service obligation with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The airport handled 27,142 passengers, 2,586 aircraft movements and 0.6 tonnes of cargo in 2014. Accidents and incidents Kato Air Flight 605 took place on 29 September 2004, when an Algerian asylum seeker attacked the pilots with an axe. He boarded the Bod√∏-bound flight at Framnes and attacked the pilots mid- flight and attempted to take control over the aircraft. He was overpowered by two passengers and the first officer was able to take control over the aircraft, which was only from the ground.

There have been historical incidents of the practice being carried out during times of social upheaval. A 2016 report by Daniel Wright, senior lecturer in tourism at the University of Central Lancashire, predicts the hunting of the poor will become a hobby of the super-rich in a future plagued by economic and ecological disasters and overpopulation.  Historical examples  *In Ancient Greece, the upper class of Sparta regularly practiced the stalking and murder of members of their servile helot population; such murders were carried out both by the secret police (Crypteia) as a means of keeping the helots cowed and unlikely to revolt, and as part of the military training (agoge) for Spartan youths. *During the Spanish Civil War, a real-world version of this practice became popular among the sons of wealthy landowners. The hunts took place on horseback and targeted landless peasants as an extension of the White Terror. They were jokingly referred to as \\"reforma agraria\\" referencing the grave their quarry would be dumped into and the land reforms the lower classes had been attempting to attain. *On July 18, 1984, 41-year-old James Oliver Huberty walked into a San Ysidro McDonalds & committed the worst mass shooting in U.S. history (being surpassed 7 years later by the 1991 Luby‚Äôs massacre).

The territory of Shahabad and Ismailabad fell to Sardar Mehar Singh. Several attempts were made by the Afghans to dislodge the Sikhs, but they were repulsed every time. It was during this period, between 1770 and 1780, that a magnificent old mosque, said to have been built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1630, was converted into a gurdwara.

Biography He was born in Telz, Lithuania, in 1905, the son of Rabbi Chaim Rabinowitz (Reb Chaim Telzer) (1856-1930), one of the rosh yeshivas at the Telshe yeshiva, and Osnat Geffen (1880-1942). Rabbi Azriel was a brilliant young man and by the age of 20 had mastered the entire Talmud in depth. Upon the death of his father in 1931, he was appointed to the faculty of the yeshiva at the young age of 26. The following year, he married Channa (1908-1941), daughter of Rabbi Mordechai Zev Dzikansky, with whom he had three children, Chaim (1932-1941), Avigdor (1935-1941), and Shoshana. Teaching style His ability to go through a volume, absorb its contents in depth and remember everything, in a matter of several hours, distinguished him from his colleagues. His students relate how on occasion, Rabbi Rabinowitz would leave the yeshiva thinking over a particular Talmudic concept, and became so engrossed that he was unaware that he had walked all the way out of the town's boundaries. Indeed, despite his youth he was one of the greatest Torah scholars of his generation. He behaved modestly, not wanting to bring any special attention to himself. His complete knowledge and understanding of the requirements of mitzvot, would never impel him to render halachic decisions for others, because he did not want to assume such a great responsibility. Rabbi Rabinowitz organized lectures in his own home to assist students who were finding the transition from the mechina (preparatory school), to the yeshiva proper, a difficult one. He also arranged lectures at his home on the subjects found in the second half of the Talmudic Tractate being studied in the yeshiva, which was not lectured on by the faculty. Telz massacre On Tuesday, July 15 (20 Tammuz) 1941, Nazi forces and local Lithuanian sympathizers massacred the male population of Telz, including Rabbi Azriel Rabinowitz and the faculty of the Telshe yeshiva. His wife and children were murdered on 17 August 1941. Almost all of Rabbi Rabinowitz's writings were lost in the Holocaust. A few lectures recorded by students have been published in Talmudic journals.

Raichur thermal power station. It is hence called shaktinagar (in Kannada shakti = power, nagar = place). Shatkinagar is situated on the border of Karnataka. Prior to RTPS there was a small village called Deosugar which is famous for its Lord Sugureshwara temple. Every year a car fair is held at the temple's premises and lakhs of devotees in and around Raichur will visit this place to witness this car festival. This car fair is held in the month of November or December for a week and the temple has a great historical significance. The RTPS was built in 1980 a few km from Deosugar and hence this place is called Shaktinagar thereafter. The famous river of south India, River Krishna flows through this place. The thermal power station's water requirement is met by this river. There is a KPCL (Karnataka Power Corporation Limited) colony in which all the employees of this thermal power plant reside here. The colony has around 5000 houses which are built by KPCL. The colony is very clean, wide roads and well maintained with 40% of green cover which makes this place look beautiful in monsoon. The colony has recreation clubs, a hospital, and a swimming pool. The DAV school contains many students who are the children of engineers of the colony. Raichur Thermal Power Station RTPS is the first thermal power plant in the Karnataka state. It has 8 units. It has an installed capacity of 1720MW of power. The thermal power plant caters to around 1/3 (35MU) of power demand in Karnataka. The PLF (plant load factor) of the power station is around 90%. The power plant holds the national record of 1 year of continuous power supply by its 1 generating unit. Every year the thermal power plant receives numerous awards for its outstanding power generation and maintenance. Daily around 5 trains with 59 wagons in each of coal is required for power generation. The coal is bought from all parts of India.

It was originally transmitted on 6 October 1972. The title may have come from the song, Asleep in the Deep that is referenced by Private Walker in the episode. Synopsis A bomb falls on the local pumping station, where Walker and Godfrey are on patrol. Efforts at freeing them result in the rest of the platoon becoming trapped with them, and a pipe bursting, filling the room rapidly with water... Plot The episode opens with the Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard unit in an air raid shelter during a raid. Jones and his section arrive, Frazer complaining that the \\"shrapnel was coming down like hail\\". Pike makes a fool of himself by explaining why he acquires hundreds and thousands as his sweet ration to Mainwaring, but to Pike's dismay his sweets all go on the floor when a bomb falls nearby. They are joined by ARP Warden Hodges, who mentions that a bomb has fallen on the local pumping station. Godfrey and Walker are on duty there, so some of the platoon, with Hodges, go to rescue them. When they arrive, Walker and Godfrey are unhurt but Godfrey is asleep in an inner room and Walker cannot wake him up. Bomb damage has made the corridor very dangerous, Mainwaring puts two dots on pieces of paper to determine who goes at the head of the human chain with Hodges picking the first of the two dots, Mainwaring pulls a blank piece but lies to stop the young Pike of having any chance of being at the front, they quickly shift the rubble to gain access to the trapped men. Once inside, Jones slams the door, thus bringing the roof down in the corridor, so trapping everyone except Jones, who is left outside. When Jones goes for help he breaks the handle of the outside door, so he is trapped as well. Mainwaring enlists Wilson's help to cheer the men up by singing \\"Underneath the Spreading Chestnut Tree\\" but whilst doing this a pipe bursts and the inner room starts to fill with water, Pike being soaked first by the jet of water. Later, the inner room is now waist high in water. Only Pike is standing in the cold water, pleading with everyone to do something otherwise he will drown. Hodges is floating in a tank, the rest of the platoon is crammed onto the bunks. Much later, the water is neck high. Pike is still pleading, and the rest assure him that they are thinking about how to get out. Walker and Godfrey discover a manhole that can be opened to allow them all to escape. The spanner to do this is hanging high on the wall, and when Hodges tries to reach it, he falls out of his tank and into the water, dropping the spanner. Pike dives under the water and retrieves the spanner, thus getting completely soaked again, but at least the men can get out. After opening the manhole, they crawl through it to the outside of the pumping house, then run round to rescue Jones, who has managed to open another inspection hatch into the flooded chamber. Godfrey shuts the outside door (\\"there's a very nasty draught, and I wouldn't want anyone to catch cold\\"), thus trapping them all in the outer room again, leaving Wilson to have to go around again through the water to get help.

In Shamsabad, 18% of the population is under 6 years of age.  History   Geographic description  Shamsabad is situated latitude 27.32 longitude 79.28 at a distance of 22 km to the west of Farrukhabad. Most probably the river Ganges used to flow beside its northern boundary. A mohalla, locality called the Ghatiapur crossing point, is reminiscent of this. The Ganges is about 4 km away now.  Weather  Shamsabad is hot and dusty in peak summer months of May & June and cold in the winter months of December & January. Summer temperatures can rise to early 40 degree Celsius and minimum Winter temperature can reach 0 degree Celsius. The monsoon season starts from end June and ends in September with about 26 inches of rainfall.  Historical background  Shamsabad is a much older settlement than both Farrukhabad and Kaimganj, both of which were founded in the early 18th century A.D. Kampil, a nearby small town situated about 25 km to the west of Shamsabad is also an ancient site. It is associated with the Panchalas of Mahabharat fame. Historians believe that during their eastern migration, Indo-European language speaking people moved towards the middle Gangetic region and settlements like Kampil and Amritpur - a small town about 25 km from Shamsabad across the Ganges - also grew up. During most of the ninth to twelfth centuries, Shamsabad - then known as 'Khor Nagar' ('Khor' meaning king and 'nagar' meaning city) - was ruled first by the Pratihars, then by the Gaharwars dynasties from Kannauj. It is variously said that one Prajan Pal or Jai Singh Dev or Rai Singh Gaharwar was the ruler at the time of Shams Uddin Iltitmish's invasion circa 1212 and Shamsabad is named after the latter. However, Zia Uddin Barni in his 'Tareekh-e- Firozshahi' (written about 150 years after the death of Shams Uddin Iltitmish) still uses the name of the place as 'Khor Nagar' when describing an unusual incident which occurred in the Ganges here. During Delhi's Sultanant period (1202-1526), Shamsabad was quite an important place, being the subedari-provincial-capital. A road from the east to Delhi went through it. Shamsabad, being a strategic town on the fluid boundary between the Lodis of Delhi (1451‚Äì1526) and the Sharqi kings of Jaunpur, was a hot spot and exchanged hands between the two. There is still a graveyard in the east of Shamsabad known as 'ganj-e-shaheedan' where a battle was fought between the Lodis and the Sharqis. Both Khizr Khan (1414‚Äì1421) and Sikandar Lodi (1489‚Äì1517), Delhi Sultanat kings, came to Shamsabad. Sikandar Lodi camped near Shamsabad for six months and a village called Sikandar pur Mahmood to the west of Shamsabad might have been named after this event. Sikandar Lodi had Imad Khan Farmoli and Sulaiman Khan Farmoli as his Subedars in Shamsabad. Another village almost adjacent to Sikandar pur Mahmood is known as Imad pur. This strengthens the view that both of these villages were named after Sikandar Lodi and Imad Khan respectively. The Moghals who succeeded in establishing their kingdom in 1526 also took interest in Shamsabad. Babar made Vikrama Jeet Sisodia his Subedar -provincial governor- of Shamsabad in 1528. Humayun, following his defeat by Sher Shah Suri circa 1541 at Chausa (after which village the famous mango variety is named) near Kannauj fled to Delhi through Shamsabad. The Saiyyeds of Shamsabad provided boats for Humayun as the Ganges was in spate. Sher Shah was in hot pursuit and this help by the Saiyyeds made him furious. However, considering the religious sanctity of the Saiyyeds he gave them the lesser punishment of having their ears cut off but dealt with the others who helped Humayun much more severely. In Akbar's reign (1556‚Äì1605) Shamsabad was made a pargane (Tehsil) of Kannauj Sarkar (District). Mirza Tahir and Rai Damodar Das -a Kayastha- were Akbar's chief officers who rebuilt Shamsabad from 1589. A village adjacent to Shamsabad at its northern boundary is known as Akbar pur Damodar. A mohalla called Manjhli Haveli is said to be named after the residence of the middle son of Rai Damodar Das. This mohalla is also in the northern part of Shamsabad. There was a reputed madrasa (school) in Shamsabad during Akbar's reign and even his courtier, the well-known historian Abdul Qadir Badyuni, stayed here for sometime. After the weakening of the Moghal Empire and the founding of Farrukhabad in 1714 by Mohammed Khan Bangash (a Subedar of Farrukh Siyar, the Moghal King in Delhi), Shamsabad was de facto ruled by the Bangash Nawabs till their treaty with East India Company in June 1802. Thereafter, until 1947, it was under the British rule with the exception of a few months in the First War of Independence in 1857. Shamsabad and its people also played some part in this war. Finally, the English troops defeated the freedom fighters in January 1858 at a place called Jhanna Khar to the west of Shamsabad. Shamsabad came under the Notified/Town Area Act in 1908. It has 33 mohallas and in the 2011 census its provisional population was 27,385.  Social scene   Monuments and buildings  1\\\\.

It is a generalization, developed independently by Dana Scott and Richard Montague, of the more widely known relational semantics for modal logic. Whereas a relational frame \\\\langle W,R\\\\rangle consists of a set W of worlds (or states) and an accessibility relation R intended to indicate which worlds are alternatives to (or, accessible from) others, a neighborhood frame \\\\langle W,N\\\\rangle still has a set W of worlds, but has instead of an accessibility relation a neighborhood function : N : W \\\\to 2^{2^W} that assigns to each element of W a set of subsets of W. Intuitively, each family of subsets assigned to a world are the propositions necessary at that world, where 'proposition' is defined as a subset of W (i.e. the set of worlds at which the proposition is true). Specifically, if M is a model on the frame, then : M,w\\\\models\\\\square A \\\\Longleftrightarrow (A)^M \\\\in N(w), where : (A)^M = \\\\\\\\{u\\\\in W \\\\mid M,u\\\\models A \\\\\\\\} is the truth set of A. Neighborhood semantics is used for the classical modal logics that are strictly weaker than the normal modal logic K. Correspondence between relational and neighborhood models To every relational model M = (W,R,V) there corresponds an equivalent (in the sense of having point-wise equivalent modal theories) neighborhood model M' = (W,N,V) defined by : N(w) = \\\\\\\\{(A)^M: M,w\\\\models\\\\Box A\\\\\\\\}. The fact that the converse fails gives a precise sense to the remark that neighborhood models are a generalization of relational ones.

He is descendant from the Abbasid family. As the Mahdi's ablest general, he played an important role in the fate of General Charles George Gordon and the loss of the Sudan to Egypt. In Britain Osman became a notorious figure, both demonised as a savage and respected as a warrior. Winston Churchill describes him as an \\"astute\\" and \\"prudent\\" man, calling him \\"the celebrated, and perhaps immortal, Osman Digna.\\" Mahdist leader He hailed from the Hadendoa tribe of the Beja people. His birthplace is unknown; Suakin was said to be the town where he was born. He was originally known as Osman Ali. He lived in Alexandria, Egypt, where he dealt in the selling of slaves. After the English forced him to quit his business, he took part in the revolt of Ahmed 'Urabi. After the failure of that movement at the Battle of Tel al-Kebir (13 September 1882), he attached himself to the cause of the Mahdi. About this time he received the name \\"Digna\\" because of the fullness of his beard (\\"the bearded one,\\" from , \\"the beard\\"). He maintained himself at the head of a powerful army around Suakin. His first battle was an attempt to capture a Turkish-held fort at Sinkat in 1883. His initial attack was repulsed, but the fort eventually fell after a siege. At the First Battle of El Teb he inflicted a severe defeat on a much larger Egyptian force led by Baker Pasha near Tokar, on 4 February 1884. Immediately after this victory, however, a new British-Egyptian force was sent to retrieve the situation, and he was defeated by General Graham near Tokar at the Second Battle of El Teb. Both sides withdrew to restore their forces, but Graham soon launched a second attack designed to crush Digna completely. At the Battle of Tamai, the Mahdist forces exploited a gap in the British position, and succeeded in breaking an infantry square. They were almost able to cut off parts of the British force, but the British were able to rally and consolidate their position. The Mahdists were subjected to intense flanking fire and were finally defeated. Despite his defeat, as the only foreign commander who broke the British infantry square, Digna and his troops acquired a reputation amongst the British for immense fighting-prowess. The prowess of his troops is celebrated in Rudyard Kipling's poem \\"Fuzzy-Wuzzy\\". He is also named in \\"The Battle of El-Teb\\", a poem by William McGonagall. The defeats did not, however, destroy the Mahdists. Digna remaining in control of his supporters. Graham later withdrew, and Digna restored his army. He presented the battle as a victory, saying that the British had fled \\"in fear\\". He wrote to the Mahdi claiming that he had inflicted 8000 casualties on the British, with only 2000 of his own troops killed. Official British losses were 100 killed. Nevertheless, the British campaign had achieved very little. Digna \\"retained both Sinkat and Tokar and the Suakim-Berber route was controlled by the Ansar [Mahdists]\\". The situation led to the increasing isolation of General Gordon who was under siege in Khartoum. Gordon was unable to withdraw to Egypt, and British troops were not quickly sent to relieve him. After the fall of Khartoum to the Mahdists, Osman is said to have been given Gordon's watch and sword to show to the Mahdists at Suakin as proof of the victory. Later operations He later served under the Mahdi's successor Abdallahi ibn Muhammad (known as the Khalifa), who launched a series of military operations in subsequent years. Osman took command of a Mahdist force invading Ethiopia in 1885, but was defeated by Ethiopian general Ras Alula at the Battle of Kufit on 23 September. In December, 1888, he fought at the Battle of Suakin, attempting to capture the local Water Forts. He suffered a bloody reverse at the hands of General Grenfell, and was wounded in the arm. Until 1891 Osman continued to direct Mahdist forces in eastern Sudan, fending off Egyptian forces. In February 1891 a combined British and Egyptian force captured Tokar. Local tribes defected from the Mahdists, forcing Osman to retreat to the mountains. He remained a leader in the Mahdist army but was only marginally involved in the conflicts that led to the final defeat and death of the Khalifa. When the British under Herbert Kitchener moved into the Sudan in the spring of 1898, the Khalifa sent a force under Emir Mahmud Ahmad to join with Osman's army. Osman's plan to outflank Kitchener by moving up to Atbara was approved by the Khalifa, but Mahmud overruled Osman when he proposed to move their forces even further upriver to Adaramra, threatening Kitchener's line of communications. Instead Mahmoud created a fortified defensive camp at Atbara. This became a sitting target for Kitchener. At the ensuing Battle of Atbara, he launched a barrage followed by a rapid attack. The Mahdist position collapsed. Osman managed to lead a few thousand warriors on a retreat to the south, and most of the remainder were killed or captured, including Mahmud who was captured by Sudanese troops of the Egyptian Brigade. In 1899 he fought in the last campaign of the Mahdist forces, whose strength had been broken in the previous year at Omdurman. At the Battle of Umm Diwaykarat he was injured, but was the only leader who escaped and continued the resistance. He tried to reach safety in the Hejaz, but on 19 January 1900, he was captured near Tokar and sent as a prisoner to Rosetta. He served in prison for eight years and after his release stayed in Egypt until he died in 1926.

It is the 3rd largest town in Szabolcs-Szatm√°r-Bereg after Ny√≠regyh√°za and M√°t√©szalka with a population of 16 669 people. The Subregion of Kisv√°rda lies between two large landscapes, the Ny√≠rs√©g and the R√©tk√∂z. Kisv√°rda is just from the border of Ukraine, from Slovakia, from Ny√≠regyh√°za, from Ungv√°r (Uzhorod), from Beregsz√°sz (Berehove), from S√°toralja√∫jhely and from Dorol≈£, Romania. Etymology The name of the town, which means \\"little castle\\" in Hungarian, dates back to the Conquest of Hungary. The conquering Hungarians named the town for its earthwork. In the Middle Ages, it occurred like Warda and Warada in documents. The \\"kis\\" (meaning little) word part was added to differentiate the town from Nagyv√°rad (now Oradea, Romania), \\"nagy\\" meaning great or large. Coat of arms The red and white stripes on the shield symbolize the √Årp√°d Dynasty, the medieval kings of Hungary. The sword with the Sun and green background shows the heroic knights of Kisv√°rda. The scales represents the town's trade and markets. In the middle of the shield there is the Castle of Kisv√°rda in gold. There is a winged dragon around the shield biting its tail. This is the insignia of the Order of the Dragon which derives from the V√°rday family's coat of arms. History The conquering Hungarians found a hill fort here in 895 which then they used for their border protection system. St. Ladislaus defeated the Kuntesk Cuman prince in 1085 in a great fight. In memory of the glorious battle, he had a church established. He dedicated it to St Peter and St Paul Apostles. In the 12th century, the settlement's importance declined. The castle became the possession of the Swabian-Swedish Gutkeled family. The settlement was the denominator of one branch of the family, the V√°rdays. The V√°rday family worked a lot to revive Kisv√°rda. Shortly the place got their fair housing law. Pelb√°rt V√°rady got permission from the king to build the Castle of Kisv√°rda in 1415. In 1421, it became a town. Istv√°n V√°rday, the Archbishop of Kalocsa, Matthias Corvinus's chancellor expended the town's autonomy in 1468. At that time, the population of Kisv√°rda was more than a thousand people. It became the centre of Szabolcs. The first guild was formed in 1591. Because of the Turkish conquest of Hungary and the economic changes, the town's importance diminished. Prior to World War II, Kisv√°rda had a large Jewish community that represented about 30 percent of the town's population. They were confined to a ghetto in 1944, and then deported to Auschwitz. The majority perished there. A small community was re- established after the war, but almost no Jews are left in Kisv√°rda today. The former synagogue, which remains one of the most imposing structures in Kisv√°rda, is now a local history museum known as the R√©tk√∂zi M√∫zeum. Economy Historically, Kisv√°rda has been a market town for the surrounding agricultural district, and is also has some light industry such as distilling, electrics, and brake pad production. It is on the main railway line from the Hungarian capital of Budapest to Ukraine. Kisv√°rda also attracts tourists to its thermal springs, and the ruins of a medieval castle.

Ellie manipulates Belle into pouring red wine on Joanie's dress and Lisa covers for her. Belle shows Jermaine a scan photo, which she took from Charity. Angie overhears Belle talking to Ellie and exposes her lies in front of her family. Belle suffers a breakdown in the caf√© and is taken home by her parents. When the paramedics arrive, the family discover Belle has gone. The family search for Belle, who is living rough and tormented by Ellie. Lisa is angry with Zak when he fails to answer a phone call from Belle and she leaves a voicemail. A body is found by the police, who Lisa and Zak identify, but it's not Belle. Belle's sleeping bag is taken by three men, and out of desperation tries to steal a piece of toast from a customer's plate in a cafe. The cafe owner later tries to feed Belle, but she runs away when he talks to a police officer and she ends up collapsing from malnutrition and dehydration. Belle is taken to hospital and Lisa and Zak are informed, but when they visit, Belle lashes out at Lisa, thinking she will kill her. Belle is assessed and Zak, Lisa and Jermaine are told Belle is hearing more than one voice and Jermaine thinks Belle has schizophrenia. Zak and Lisa are informed that they want to send Belle to a unit in Surrey. Belle returns over six weeks later to visit her family for the day. Casting Twins Emily and James Mather were cast as Belle after their mother, Joanne, was told the soap's producers were looking for babies to play a role in the show. She explained \\"My two had just been born so I contacted casting. When they saw Emily and James they liked them straight away and they made their first appearance when they were only 10 days old.\\" The twins were brought in when the producers realised that the role would be too demanding for one child to play. Emily and James took it in turns to play Belle. Their mother was on-set all the time and chose which twin appeared on-screen. As Belle grew older and her storylines increased, the new actress was sought for the part. After a series of auditions, Eden Taylor- Draper was cast as Belle and she began appearing on-screen in 2005. Development It was revealed on 23 January 2014 that Belle would have a life-changing storyline later in the year which would see her unintentionally kill her best friend, Gemma Andrews (Tendai Rinomhota) after an argument gets out of hand. In March 2014, the character confessed and was charged with murder. In June 2014, the character was charged with manslaughter and later sentenced to 3 years imprisonment. This sentence was later reduced to 1 year in August 2014. In March 2016, it was reported that Belle would fall for Jermaine Bailey, a local doctor. Taylor-Draper said of the storyline that Belle's relationship with Dr. Bailey \\"is an escape from her [Belle's] life\\" and that her character had \\"fallen for this guy\\". Taylor-Draper also stated she regards the storyline as a coming of age storyline for Belle. Reception For her portrayal of Belle, Taylor-Draper earned the Spectacular Scene of the Year award at the 2006 British Soap Awards along with co-star Luke Tittensor for the storyline where Belle and Daz fell down a mineshaft. The following year, she won Best Young Actor at the Inside Soap Awards. Eden Taylor-Draper then won the Best Child Performance at the British Soap Awards in 2013.

It is located on the left bank of the Vaigai River, sixteen miles north west of Madurai. It is one of 12 \\"town- panchayats\\" of Madurai district.  Etymology  The town has been variously referred to as \\"Sholavandan\\", \\"Solaikuruchi\\" and \\"Senagapuri\\". During the Sangam period, the town belonged to Pandya Kingdom. There is a popular local myth, that a war between Chola and the Pandya kingdoms, resulted in the name. The invading Chola king, apparently got a sense of reverence and awe, seeing the intensive agriculture and scenic beauty of the village, irrigated by the Vaigai river; which reminded him of the Cauvery Delta region. He abandoned the war. The town was then named as Cholavandan [Cholan+Vandan]. Uvandan means getting awed, in Tamil. Legend has it that the invading king found the village and its flourishing agriculture cultivation, even more agriculturally prosperous then the historically famous Tanjore villages: and called this town as \\"Chinna Tanjai\\"(). Vaigai River border of Sholavandan western side Geography  Sholavandan lies on the left bank of the river Vaigai. The river turns from its easterly direction, to bend and travel in a north‚Äìsouth direction at Sholavandan - before turning south east and flowing towards Madurai city. Sholavandan can be stated to be lying in some sort of a valley - between the Nagamalai hills and the Sirumalai. Both these hills can be perhaps described as spurs of the Western Ghats. Sholavandan is also the name of a forest range under Madurai division. The hills have some tracts as reserved forests, which is classified as a dry deciduous forest. The geology of the land around Sholavandan is speculated to be hard rock, represented by the Charnockites and mixed Gneisses. Sholavandan being on the banks of the river Vaigai would presumably have Alluvial soil. The fertile soil around Sholavandan could be due to this land being a part of an alluvial plain.  History  This town appears in history from the Sangam period itself. A hillock in Anaipatti, a few kilometres from Sholavandan has a large cave: with hundreds of Jain beds with inscriptions carved in the Brahmi script. These are dated to 300 BCE. One of these inscriptions is stated to trace the origin of the name of the city Madurai. Some Jain beds around the village seem to have epigraph evidence of Sholavandan. A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: from the Stone Age to the Twelfth Century. By Upinder Singh p387 In stone beds made by Jains, inscriptions have been found in the Tamil-Brahmi script; :\\"‡Æ™‡Ææ‡Æï‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æä‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡Æ™‡Øá(‡Æ∞)‡Æ§‡Æ©‡Øç; ‡Æ™‡Æø‡Æü‡Æ©‡Øç ‡Æá‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æö‡ØÜ‡Æ™‡Øã‡Æ©‡Øç\\" where ‡Æ™‡Ææ‡Æï‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æä‡Æ∞‡Øç (Paganur) is thought to refer to the present village of Sholavandan Jain beds from Kongar Puliyankulam Pagunur has been stated to have been established in the 200 BCE; which can perhaps be taken as one of the earliest evidence of documented inhabitation. Thenur a village near Sholavandan, has been reported to have been mentioned in Sangam texts. A rock cut inscription in the nearby Samanamalai hillock, dated also to 200 BCE, has reported one interpretation of the Tamil Brahmi script to include the word Thenur. A gold treasure found in Thenur, has been assigned a date of around 300 BCE: which could be another byte of information on the antiquity of the Sholavandan. The Tenkarai irrigation tank has been reported to have been dug by Chezhiyan Senthanm (620 to 640 CE). A barrage to feed water into this tank from the Vaigai river is also attributed to this period. An inscription has been noted, which records the renovation of the \\"Kallanai\\" (kall -stone, anai-bund) during the period of Pandyan Srivallabhan.(1175-1180CE) According to V. Vedachalam, an archeologist, a twelfth-century inscription found in Kuruvithurai village, refers to this channel as \\"Parakrama Pandian Peraru\\". The king referred to, could be conceivably Parakrama Pandyan II The famous Saivite saint, Thiru GnanaSambandar is associated with the banks of the river Vaigai at a spot a couple of kilometres downstream from Sholavandan. There are unauthenticated stories that during the reign of Arikesari Maravarman( 670-710 CE)- Sambandar worshipped a Siva lingam at this spot, which he called ‚ÄòEdu Senranai Tharum Edakam.‚Äô That became the present Thiruvedagam. The Iyravadeshwarar temple in Anaiyur, nearby Sholavandan: is estimated to have been constructed around the eight or the ninth century. The Thengarai temple- termed Akhiladeswari sametha Moolanathar temple- dedicated to Lord Shiva is reported to have been built around 946-966 CE. An interesting sculpture here is of a bas relief, showing a person slitting his own throat. This sculpture has been dated to the tenth century; which is theorised to be commemorating an act of a \\"martyr\\". The Cholan king Raja Raja Chola I has been reported to have conquered the Pandyan kingdom, around 1000 CE: and after capturing Madurai and the surrounding region, renamed this place as \\"Chaturveda mangalam\\". The Jenagai Narayanaswamy temple is believed to have been constructed in the thirteenth century. Rani Mangammal is believed to have constructed a \\"chatram\\" (free lodge) for pilgrims, in the single agaraharam street, around 1700 CE.. Funds collected through this chatram is also believed to have paid for the more famous Mangammal chatram of Madurai. Ariyanatha Mudaliar is said to have settled some of his relatives in Sholavandan, around the sixteenth century; during the reign of Viswanatha Nayak. This is locally stated to be the origin of the Mudaliar settlement, colloquially termed \\"Mudaliar Kottai\\". In 1757, Hyder Ali captured Sholavandan, on his way from Dindigul to Madurai, reportedly \\"sweeping of the whole of the cattle and moveables in the surrounding country\\". This invasion was reportedly at the invitation of Puli Thevar and the then ruler of Madurai, Barkadthullah. Under the British rule, Sholavandan started receiving some benefits of a settled administration. In 1856, the Madurai collector reported on the construction of a new road connecting Tirumangalam, Madurai to Sholavandan; to \\"save the necessity of bandies going from the southward to Dindigul, coming into Madura\\". This road construction was apparently started with a subscription raised by the merchants of the Nadar community of Thirumangalam. Sholavandan started receiving the benefits of western school education as early as 1870. The report said that \\"Sholavandan is one of the best schools of its grade in the district...the boys pay a fee of Rs.1-8-0. There is at this school a Sanskrit class. No school house, has however yet being built\\". Another mention of the Sholavandan Anglo Vernacular school is found in another report in 1877. Sholavandan was one of the villages featuring prominently in a controversy over the legality of a traditional Hindu custom of swinging devotees from the hook in temples; which appeared in the English press in late October 1891. Sholavandan and the neighbouring villages, got increased access to Vaigai water after the construction of Peranai regulator in the 1890s decade. Culture Sholavandan features prominently in the movie Pattikada Pattanama where Sivaji Ganesan and Jayalalithaa play the lead roles. It is also featured in the movie Karimetu Karuvayan starring Vijayakanth. Intensive agriculture of paddy, seems to have shaped the culture of Sholavandan. Retired professor and archaeologist V Vedhachalam, has documented a popular saying that a person who went to Sholavandan would get his daily rice. \\"The quote became popular as Sholavandan was one of the most fertile places in Madurai, where paddy was cultivated round the clock, three seasons a year.\\" As with much of South Tamil Nadu, bull taming or Jallikattu and cock fights, are a part of the village culture. These events are usually around traditional temple. festivals. Education Sholavandan houses educational institutions like Vivekananda College, Madurai; which is located at Thiruvedagam, a couple of kilometres from Sholavandan on the banks of the river Vaigai. This is an autonomous educational institution of higher learning, affiliated to Madurai Kamaraj University. Vivekanandha Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Government Girls Highers Secondary School, Arasan shanmuganar Government boys higher secondary school, MVM Matriculation school and Kamarajar higher secondary school are the local schools. And also many other primary schools were started few years back, A primary school is started two years ago in rayapuram couple of kilometers from sholavandan which is Zee public school(CBSE curriculum). Politics Elected in the 2016 Tamil Nadu state assembly election, K.Manickam of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam represents Sholavandan in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly. Sholavandan assembly constituency is part of Theni (Lok Sabha constituency), which is represented by P. Raveendranath Kumar of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.Official biography of fourteenth Lok Sabha member Demographics At the 2001 India census, Sholavandan had a population of 21,661. (males 50%, females 50%). Sholavandan had an average literacy rate of 72% (male 79%, female 65%), higher than the national average of 59.5%. 11% of the population were under 6 years of age. Economy The main occupation of the people is agriculture which benefits from access to the irrigated water of the Vaigai river, through the Peranai regulator in Dindigul District. Sholavandan used to be very famous for its Betel leavess, which were exported to other states in the sub-continent.S. Annamalai,\\"Wilt attack and gale leave Madurai betel crop farmers in the lurch\\", The Hindu, 24 May 2005 Rice is the major crop grown; the extensive paddy fields, around Sholavandan are a visual evidence. Bananas and coconuts are the other major crops. Thenkarai village, which lies across the river Vaigai from Sholavandan is sometimes called a small \\"coconut island\\".

It belongs to a confusing group of shearwaters which are difficult to identify and whose classification is controversial. It was formerly treated as a subspecies of the Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) and is now often placed in Townsend's shearwater (Puffinus auricularis). It is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. Description It is a fairly small shearwater, in length. The wing is long and the tail is . The bird weighs .Ainley et al. (2007), \\"Measurements\\" The upperparts are black with a brown tinge while the underparts are white. The dark colouration on the face extends below the eye and is sharply separated from the white throat. There is a white patch on the flanks, extending onto the sides of the rump. The underwings are mainly white with a dark border. The undertail-coverts have a black and white pattern and appear white in the field. The bill is dark grey or brown and the legs and feet are mainly pale pink. The bird flies low over the water on stiff wings with a mixture of short glides and periods of rapid flapping. It utters a donkey-like braying call around the breeding areas. Townsend's shearwater (P. auricularis) is very similar but has dark undertail- coverts, a shorter tail and a less sharp boundary between the black and white on the face. Systematics It was described as a new species Puffinus newelli in 1900 by the American ornithologist Henry Wetherbee Henshaw using specimens obtained by Brother Matthias Newell from residents of Maui. It was later included by some authors in the Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) as was Townsend's shearwater (Puffinus auricularis).Murphy (1952) Later, Townsends's shearwater was raised back to species status with Newell's shearwater as a subspecies of it. This taxonomy was followed by the American Ornithologists' Union from the sixth edition of its checklist onwards. However Newell's differs from Townsend's shearwater in various measurements and has a different breeding season and marine habitat.Ainley et al. (2007), \\"Systematics\\" It is now often treated as a separate species, e.g. by BirdLife International following Brooke (2004).BirdLife International (2007) In 2004, a study of mitochondrial DNA sequences suggested a close relationship between Rapa shearwater (Puffinus myrtae) and Newell's shearwater and the authors proposed that Rapa shearwater be treated as a subspecies of P. newelli pending further study.Austin et al. (2004) The Rapa shearwater is now treated as a full species. Distribution It breeds in at least 20 colonies on mountain slopes in the Hawaiian Islands. The main colonies are on Kauai, on slopes around the Alakai Plateau and probably in the Mokolea Mountains.Melgar (2002) Its distribution on the other islands is uncertain but it is known to breed on Molokai and the island of Hawaii and may breed on Oahu, Maui and LƒÅnai.Ainley et al. (2007), \\"Distribution\\" From April to November it can be seen in the waters around the Hawaiian Islands, particularly around Kauai. Outside the breeding season it disperses into the tropical Pacific Ocean. Its distribution at sea is little known but many move south and east into the waters of the Equatorial Counter Current. It has been recorded as far west as the Mariana Islands. In the south there are records from Samoa in September 1977 and American Samoa in January 1993.Watling (2001) Behaviour Feeding It feeds far from land, in areas of deep water (at least 2000 meters). Its diet is little known but includes squid and small fish. It dives into the water to catch its prey, swimming down to a depth of up to 10 meters using its wings to move forward. It is attracted to schools of tuna and gathers in flocks with other seabird species to catch prey driven to the surface by the tuna.Ainley et al. (2007), \\"Food Habits Reproduction By 1908, it was thought to be extinct but was rediscovered in 1947 and found breeding on Kauai in 1967. The nest site is a burrow dug into a steep slope, usually sheltered by uluhe (Dicranopteris linearis ferns). A single white egg is laid during the first two weeks of June. Both parents incubate the egg and an incubation period of 62 days has been recorded. The young birds leave the nest in October, 88‚Äì100 days after hatching. They fly out to sea and are no longer dependent on their parents.Ainley et al. (2007), \\"Breeding\\" Conservation It was formerly a much more common bird with a wider breeding distribution in the islands. It has declined due to habitat loss and predation by introduced species such as mongooses, rats, cats and barn owls. Young birds in particular are attracted to the lights of urban areas at night and many die in collisions with power lines and buildings. The population was estimated at 84,000 birds in the mid-1990s. A severe decline has occurred in recent years which may be associated with the effects of Hurricane Iniki in 1992. Footnotes References *Ainley, D. G., T. C. Telfer, and M. H. Reynolds (1997).

Playcentres instead recognised the value of early child education and specifically the educational value of child-initiated play. Playcentre is indigenous to New Zealand,http://www.playcentre.org.nz/history.php but is now also established in Japan.http://playcentre.org.nz/news.php?a=118&id;=&assocID;=&national;= Their mission is stated as \\"WhƒÅnau Tupu NgƒÅtahi - Families growing together.\\" History and spread The movement started during the Second World War to provide a break for mothers as well as means to allow for the social development of the child within a cooperative environment. In the initial years of the war, educator Gwen Somerset, who is responsible for the movement's philosophy, began to use Feilding's Community Centre (which in itself was the first in New Zealand) to hold classes on child development and parenting, and to facilitate children's daycare by means of a playgroup; this acting as the forerunner experiment to the playcentre movement. The first proper playcentre was established in 1941 in the Wellington suburb of Karori.Densem, A. & Chapman, B. (2000). Learning together: The Playcentre Way. Auckland: New Zealand Playcentre Federation. p35 From the start each playcentre was a community driven initiative, organised by parents, utilising existing premises (e.g. church or community halls) and using parents as teachers. This allowed the easy spread of the movement, now encompassing over 450 centres around New Zealand and explains why they are the dominant provider of early childhood education in rural areas. Gwen Somerset, Joan Wood, Inge Smithells and Beatrice Beeby were among the founders of the organisation. The Playcentre model has been copied by groups in other countries, including the Japan Playcentre Association.http://www8.plala.or.jp/playcentre/ Philosophy Playcentre was instrumental in introducing the concept of education through play and through child-initiated activities to the early childhood setting in New Zealand. This philosophy has since been adopted throughout all New Zealand early childhood education centres through the New Zealand national curriculum for early childhood education, Te WhƒÅriki.http://www.educate.ece.govt.nz/Programmes/TeWhariki.aspx They remain a champion of child-led non-structured play as the best form of education in early childhood. The organisation believes that parents are the first and best educators of their children and children learn best when they initiate their learning through play (child-initiated play). Within the centres children and adults learn alongside each other, in agreement with the socio-cultural model of learning which posits that a child learns best when surrounded by trusted members of his or her community.http://www.playcentre.org.nz/philosophy.php Each playcentre is a cooperative. Parents decide how their centre will run and are responsible for the education of their children. Parents also make decisions giving direction to how their association (regional body) and the New Zealand Playcentre Federation (national body) will run. Practice Children attend half day sessions, no more than 5 times a week. Children from 0 to 6 years, normally in mixed age groups, attend sessions run by parents - a minimum of 1 adult to four children. Parents manage all aspects of each playcentre, including the premises, administration, education of the children and education of themselves. Structure Every centre is part of a regional association. There are currently 33 regional associations,http://www.playcentre.org.nz/assoc.php which provide support and training and are governed by their member Playcentres. In turn each association is supported by the national body, The New Zealand Playcentre Federation. The Federation is governed by the associations and provides support to meet the goals of the associations. Playcentres are chartered early childhood education providers with the New Zealand Ministry of Education. Independent research and audits by the Education Review Office confirm the quality of Playcentre's programmes. Adult education programme Playcentre Education administers the NZQA approved Playcentre Diploma in Early Childhood and Adult Education.http://www.playcentre.org.nz/education.php The course assists parents in developing their parenting skills and their ability to facilitate early childhood education in a playcentre setting. The programme also helps members to learn how to work in a cooperative as well as being the training ground for Playcentre adult educators. The adult education programme is delivered at no cost to the learner. Notable Playcentre people Famous Playcentre alumni include New Zealand's first female Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon.

Russian years In his early twenties, Cavos accepted a position as conductor of the Italian operatic company Astariti, and traveled with the company to St. Petersburg in 1797. The company was soon disbanded, but Cavos had fallen in love with St. Petersburg, and entered the service of the Imperial Theatres, at first as composer for a French opera troupe with the responsibility to write music for the opera-vaudevilles.Figes, Orlando (2002). \\"Natasha's Dance: A Cultural History of Russia\\" p. 485 New York: Metropolitan Books In 1803 the Emperor appointed Cavos Kapellmeister of Italian and Russian opera, placing him in charge of the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre. He also served as a professor at the Saint Catherine School, and later occupied the same place in the Smolny Convent. He began composing his own operas in 1805. These included: Knyaz- nevidimka(The Invisible Prince) (1805), Ilya Bogatyr (Ilya the Hero) (1807), Zephyre et Flore (1808), Ivan Susanin (1815), and The Firebird (1822).Abraham, Gerald (1982). \\"The New Oxford History of Music: The Age of Beethoven, 1790-1830\\" pp. 530-1 Oxford: Oxford University Press He also contributed to the second part of the opera tetralogy Rusalka (1803-1807).Abraham, Gerald (1982). \\"The New Oxford History of Music: The Age of Beethoven, 1790-1830\\" p. 531 Oxford: Oxford University Press The Cossack as Poet, a one-act vaudeville (1812), remained in the repertory until 1852. John Warrack wrote of Cavos' work: ::Cavos's operas draw on Russian subjects. Ilya Bogatyr, for which the fabulist Ivan Krylov wrote the libretto, is a Romantic magic opera continuing the line of Catherine's Fevey text and anticipating Glinka's Ruslan and Lyudmila. A few, such as The Firebird (1822), treat the Oriental themes that had become fashionable with Russia's expansion, and thus also anticipate Ruslan and Lyudmila and Borodin's Prince Igor. Cavos's main librettist, however, was Alexander Shakhovskoy, Director of the Imperial Theatres. Shakhovskoy's text for The Cossack Poet (1812) invokes the patriotic sentiments of the times, and so, even more, does his text for Ivan Susanin (1815), a \\"rescue opera\\" owing much to French example. When Glinka's own opera about Ivan Susanin...was produced in 1836, it was Cavos who conducted; but though Cavos generously declared that his work was now superseded, it [Ivan Susanin] continued in the repertoire until 1854. Cavos' opera Ivan Susanin is regarded as the first Russian opera: the plot is based on real Russian historical fact, he included in the music the Russian folk melodies, for the first time a Russian peasant became the main character on the Opera stage - not a mythical character, not a tsar or a commander. For the first time an attempt was made to enter the theatre of the opera stage of the specific features of Russian life. However, in Russian musical literature, the analysis of this opera are devoted to only two articles (up to the present time) - of Abram Gozenpud and of Viktor Korshikov. Russian music critic Abram Gozenpud (1908 - 2004) considered that this opera was unsuccessful because it is not shown in the main: the feat of the hero. Real Ivan Susanin died from enemies, and the opera was a happy end (author of libretto is Alexander Shakhovskoy, ru: –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –®–∞—Ö–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–π).Cavos opera Ivan Susanin // ru: –û–ø–µ—Ä–∞ –ö–∞—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–Ω–æ –ö–∞–≤–æ—Å–∞ ¬´–ò–≤–∞–Ω –°—É—Å–∞–Ω–∏–Ω¬ª, –∞–≤—Ç–æ—Ä –ê. –ì–æ–∑–µ–Ω–ø—É–¥ Viktor Korshikov (Vitaly Peskov‚Äôs stepson) is full of sarcasm: \\"Shakhovskoy changed the finale: his Susanin not die the death of the hero, and wanders with the Polish detachment through the woods from tree to tree in different parts of the scene and waits, when comes Russian detachment kill poles and frees him. Susanin of Shakhovskoy himself explains his feat along the way to fellow villagers : ‚ÄûI will walk with the guests, and you call Russian soldiers, they will come, will kill all enemies and they'll take me at home\\". And Susanin was walking with very friendly polite enemies across the expanses of the scene. Of course, such a naive interpretation of images and heroes and enemies could not satisfy the sense of Patriotic consciousness, it did not reach the expected tragic pathos. Therefore, a new musical creation on the same topic was required\\"Victor Korchikov. Do you want, I'll teach you to love the opera. About the music, and not only. The publishing house –Ø–¢–¨.

Viktor Korshikov writes: \\"The choral song of peasants is beginning to Russian choral style, which was subsequently used Glinka, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Borodin and reached its zenith in the works of Mussorgsky. In this snippet, introduced principles of folk supporting voices, bass, which before were considered ornament for choir, led the main melody. This is a unique case for the beginning of the 19th century\\". The work in question, based on the tale of Ivan Susanin, was Glinka's epoch-making A Life for the Tsar. (another name for this Glinka's opera is Ivan Susanin, too). Mikhail Glinka took his creation A Life for the Tsar in the Petersburg Imperial theatre, in which the Department of opera was headed by Cavos. Cavos immediately adopted a new opera. Moreover, Cavos himself conducted the orchestra at the premiere of the opera A Life for the Tsar December 9 (November 27) 1836.ru: –ö–∞–≤–æ—Å Both opera with one plot ‚Äì of Cavos and of Glinka ‚Äì were included in the repertoire of the Bolshoi Kamenny theater in St. Petersburg for many years simultaneously. Singer Osip Petrov (a pupil of Catterino Cavos) sang the role of Ivan Susanin in both operas (the first singer of Ivan Susanin in the Cavos opera was a pupil of Catterino Cavos Piotr Zlov). Cavos acquainted the Russian public with the operas of Luigi Cherubini, √âtienne M√©hul, Carl Maria von Weber, and others.Maximovitch, Michel (1987). \\"L'op√©ra Russe\\" p. 39 Lausanne: L'Age d'Homme Cavos spent more than forty years in Russia and died in St Petersburg.

In 1787, Antonio created the role of Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni in a performance personally conducted by the opera's composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Four years later, Antonio created the role of Tito in another opera composed and conducted by Mozart, La clemenza di Tito. This was a great honor, as only a handful of singers had multiple operatic roles written expressly for them by Mozart. Cavos and Camilla's eldest son, Albert Catterinovich \\"Alberto\\" Cavos (1800-1863), was an architect best known for his theatre designs, having built Russia's two most iconic theatres, the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg (1859‚Äì1860) and the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow (1853‚Äì1856). Albert's daughter Camilla married Nicholas Benois, a prominent Russian architect, and became the matriarch of the Benois family. Her descendants included: Alexandre Benois artist and founder of Mir iskusstva, painter Zinaida Serebriakova, sculptor and graphic artist Eugene Lanceray, architect Leon Benois, and actor Sir Peter Ustinov.

Personal life and education Born in 8 October 1872 in Wimbledon to parents who were Scottish, Elles was educated at Wimbledon High School and Newnham College, Cambridge, where in 1895 she received first class honours in the Natural Science tripos. She travelled to Dublin in 1905, to take her D.Sc. The University of Cambridge was not then awarding women degrees. Between 1904-1907 an arrangement was made between the University of Cambridge, University of Oxford and Trinity College, Dublin to award women graduates of Cambridge and Oxford their degree in Ireland. She did not marry and had no children. In the last 35 years of her life she became increasingly deaf. She finally moved back to Scotland, where she died in 1960. Academic career She remained at Newnham College, University of Cambridge throughout her academic career. She worked with Ethel Wood and Charles Lapworth. Elles was an active member of the Sedgwick Club, the University of Cambridge's official geological society where she played a pivotal role in the club's running. Her work on the taxonomy and evolution of graptolites, using material from North Wales and the Skiddaw Slates of the Lake District, England and from the Wenlock Shales of the Welsh borders, was of fundamental importance. One of her innovations was to examine fossil communities rather than only individuals. She also worked on the stratigraphy of the Lower Palaeozoic, using graptolites as a tool to delineate time-zones. Elles was the first woman to be awarded a readership position at Cambridge in 1924. She became Vice-principal of Newnham College in 1930. She continued to lecture and research until her retirement in 1938. She was made Reader Emeritus in 1938, and continued to supervise students. Her excellence as a teacher was recognised by students. Some of the students that she supervised and mentored at Cambridge had significant careers in geology themselves including Dorothy Hill, Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Ripper and Oliver Bulman. Awards and Honours Elles was awarded the Lyell Fund of the Geological Society of London in 1900 for her work on graptolites, but was unable to collect it since women were barred from meetings. In 1919 she became one of the first female Fellows of the Geological Society, and in the same year won its Murchison Medal. She was president of the British Association in 1923. She was awarded the MBE for work with the Red Cross during the First World War. Publications The publications resulting from her research on graptolites were brought together in a book: *Elles, G.

It was one of the foundations of the modern welfare state. It also provided unemployment insurance for designated cyclical industries. It formed part of the wider social welfare reforms of the Liberal Governments of 1906-1915, led by Henry Campbell-Bannerman and H. H. Asquith. David Lloyd George, the Liberal Chancellor of the Exchequer, was the prime moving force behind its design, negotiations with doctors and other interest groups, and final passage. Background Lloyd George followed the example of Germany, which under conservative Chancellor Otto von Bismarck had provided compulsory national insurance against sickness from 1884. After visiting Germany in 1908, Lloyd George said in his 1909 Budget speech that Britain should aim to be \\"putting ourselves in this field on a level with Germany; we should not emulate them only in armaments.\\" His measure gave the British working classes the first contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment. The Act only applied to wage earners‚Äîabout 70% of the work force‚Äîtheir families and the unwaged were not covered.John Grigg, Lloyd George, The People's Champion, 1902-1911 (1978) After first praising the proposal, the Conservatives split, and most voted against it. But when returned to office they did not change it. Some trade unions who operated their own insurance schemes, and friendly societies who had their own schemes, at first opposed the proposal, but Lloyd George convinced most of them to support it. The friendly societies and trade unions were given a major role in administering health insurance. Covered workers outside those agencies dealt with the local post office. The government picked up responsibility for the basic benefits that the unions and societies had promised, thus greatly helping their financial reserves. The Act was psychologically important, as it removed the need for unemployed workers to rely on the stigmatised social welfare provisions of the Poor Law. This hastened the end of the Poor Law as a social welfare provider: the Poor Law Unions were abolished in 1929, and the administration of poor relief was transferred to the counties and county boroughs. Key figures in the implementation of the Act included Robert Laurie Morant and especially economist William Braithwaite, who drafted the details after inspecting the German system. The medical profession was angry with the law, despite support from some prominent leaders such as Victor Horsley.Michael S. Dunnill, \\"Victor Horsley (1857‚Äì1915) and National Insurance.\\" Journal of Medical Biography 21.4 (2013): 249-254. Some critics on the right such as Hilaire Belloc considered the Act to be a manifestation of The Servile State, which Belloc blasted in his book of the same name. Part I, Health Leaflet promoting the National Insurance Act 1911 The Doctor by Luke Fildes used in a 1911 Punch cartoon commenting on the effects of the act.Punch, 14 June 1911, p. 461. The National Insurance Act Part I provided for a National Insurance scheme with provision of medical benefits. All workers who earned under ¬£160 a year had to pay 4 pence a week to the scheme; the employer paid 3 pence, and general taxation paid 2 pence (Lloyd George called it the \\"ninepence for fourpence\\"). Under the Act, workers could take sick leave and be paid 10 shillings a week for the first 13 weeks, and 5 shillings a week for the next 13 weeks. Workers also gained access to free treatment for tuberculosis, and the sick were eligible for treatment by a panel doctor. Due to pressure from the Co- operative Women's Guild, the National Insurance Act provided maternity benefits. In parts of Scotland whose economy was still largely based on subsistence farming, the collection of cash contributions was impractical. The Highlands and Islands Medical Service was established in the crofting counties on a non-contributory basis in 1913. Though the fund was held centrally, and the obligation to pay into it was a nationally imposed one, access to the scheme was via Approved Societies, who collected the contributions, paid out for treatment, and provided day-to-day administration. A worker could choose which Approved Society to belong to; this stimulated competition between the societies. The 1911 Act only allowed Approved Societies to collect the contributions of their members; they could not keep the money, but had to forward it to the National Insurance Fund. The societies' own expenditure, such as the cost of treatment for their members, would be reimbursed by the Fund, on a six-monthly basis. The government did not reimburse any \\"improper\\" payments, such as \\"treatments\\" that did not comply with government regulations, or corrupt payments. Any organisation could become an Approved Society, as long as it was registered under the Act, and complied with the Act's obligations, including to operate on a not-for-profit basis. As well as societies created by the Trade Unions, and friendly societies, commercial insurers also established Approved Societies, such as the National Amalgamated Approved Society (created by Pearl Assurance and others); the largest Approved Societies were the four operated by Prudential, which collectively looked after 4.3 million members. Many Approved Societies were nominally profitable, contributing more to the National Insurance Fund than they took out. In 1925, and then 1931, further Acts were passed which reduced the government contribution to the Fund: the government pressured the backers of Approved Societies (the insurance companies, trade unions, and so on) to take on the financial burden themselves. Together with increasing government control on which treatments they were allowed to fund, this led many Societies to complain that they had become little more than branches of government, and membership attendance at society meetings dwindled away, becoming virtually non-existent by 1940. The National Insurance Act 1946 introduced a single national organisation in the healthcare field (the National Health Service) which, among other things, fulfilled the role of the Approved Societies; Approved Societies thus became redundant, and ceased to exist in 1948. Part II, Unemployment The National Insurance Act Part II provided for time- limited unemployment benefit for certain highly cyclical industries, especially the building trades, mechanical engineering, foundries, vehicle manufacturing, and sawmills. The scheme was based on actuarial principles, and it was planned that it would be funded by fixed payments from workers, employers, and taxpayers. It made no provision for dependants. Part II worked in a similar way to Part I. The worker gave 2d (i.e pre-decimal pence) per week while employed, the employer 2d, and the taxpayer 3d. After one week of unemployment, the worker would start to be eligible to receive 7 shillings (i.e. 84d) per week for up to 15 weeks in a year. The money would be collected from labour exchanges. By 1913, 2.3 million were insured under the scheme for unemployment benefit and almost 15 million insured for sickness benefit.Timothy T. Hellwig, \\"The Origins of Unemployment Insurance in Britain.\\" Social Science History 29#1 (2005): 107-136. A key assumption of the Act was an unemployment rate of 4.6%. At the time the Act was passed, unemployment was at 3% and the fund was expected to quickly build a surplus. Under the Act, employees' contributions to the scheme were to be compulsory and taken by the employer before the workers' salary was paid.

During the 1980s VPS/VM was the main operating system of Boston University and often ran up to 250 users at a time when rival VM/CMS computing systems could only run 120 or so users. Each user ran in a Virtual Machine under VM, an IBM hypervisor operating system. VM provided the virtual IBM 370 machine which the VPS operating system ran under. The VM code was modified to allow all the VPS virtual machines to share pages of storage with read and write access. VPS utilized a shared nucleus, as well as pages used to facilitate passing data from one VPS virtual machine to another. This organization is very similar to that of MVS; substituting Address Spaces for Virtual Machines. Origins According to Craig Estey, who worked at the Boston University Academic Computing Center between 1974 and 1977:Email From Craig Estey to Paul Cheffers 28 Dec 2011 Description An IBM-based operating system, and quite like some DOS/VSE time sharing options, VPS/VM provided the user an IBM 3270 full screen terminal (a green screen) and a user interface that was like VM/CMS. Each user had an 11 megabyte virtual machine (with a strange 3 megabyte memory gap in the middle) and, from 1984 onwards, could run several programs at a time. The operating system was sparsely documented but was written first by Charles Brown, a BU doctoral student, and John H. Porter, a physics PHD, who later became the head of the VPS project (and eventually Boston University's vice president for information systems and technologyhttp://www.bu.edu/articles/2008/the-hacker-who-built-bu-it/). Marian Moore wrote much of the later VM code necessary to run the VPS system. Josie Bondoc wrote some of the later VPS additions, like UNIX piping. Many MVS/VM programs ran on VPS/VM, such as XEDIT, and compilers for Pascal, PL/1, C and Cobol. These MVS/VM programs ran under an OS simulation program that simulated the OS/VM supervisor calls (SVCs). Margorie Orr supervised the OS simulation program development and maintenance. Some of the programmers who wrote parts of the OS simulation package, or maintained it were Margorie Orr, Timothy Greiser, Daniel Levbre, John Coldwell Lotz, and Paul Cheffers. Michael Krugman wrote some of the early main utilities such as IFMSG, the JCL language for VPS, and also MAIL, the early email program. SENDMAIL, written by Francis Costanzo, implemented email, under the BITNET system. Some pre SQL databases installed on VPS were FOCUS and NOMAD2. Michael Gettes wrote an early and quick HELP system. The file system was not hierarchical and originally each file had to have a unique 8 character filename. This eventually grew onerous and each user was given their own private directory. Tapes and IBM disk files were supported as well as native VPS text files. There was a very simple shell and no patterns were supported except for the PAW computer program, written by Paul Cheffers. The graphics department, under Glenn Bresnahan, essentially, ported over most of the UNIX utilities in the mid 1980s. William Marshall did much of the early system documentation, as well as providing PL/1 support. Joe Dempty was the User Services director. Diana Robanske was a statistics consultant and ran student assistance services from 1980-1985. John Houlihan was also a User Services statistics consultant. VPS/VM was a working pre-GUI IBM operating system, and could often run more users than other IBM TSO-based systems. When most University-based systems only provided editors and compilers, VPS provided these services to a 10,000 BU university community for over 10 years. VPS/VM policy was for the operating system and main utilities to be written in IBM 370 assembler language. This decision restricted the development of the system and it ultimately could not compete with the UNIX- based systems which eventually replaced it. However, VPS eventually modeled many of the features of then-current operating systems around the world and was a keen trainer for many companies that needed IBM370 assembler programmers in the 1980s.

It has developed into a seaside resort, along with the nearby town of Harihareshwar, which also has a Shiva temple. Located on a peninsula, the town itself boasts many beaches, in addition to proximity to numerous other beach destinations such as Diveagar Beach and Kondivali Beach. People from across Maharashtra come to Shrivardhan and the nearby beaches all year round. The taluka of Shriwardhan is an ancient place of historical importance and is mentioned as being visited by Arjuna Pandav in his pilgrimage. It was an important port in the past, well known to traders of Ahmednagar and Bijapur in the 16th and 17th centuries. It appears in the accounts of leading European travellers, for example, Ziffardan. In 1538, Dom Joao de Castro Dom Joao de Castro, Primeiro Roteiro da Costa da India, Page 47 described it as having little water under the pier at low tide, but that the interior of the city was large and roomy. It is notable as the birthplace of Balaji Vishwanath, the first Peshwa (1713‚Äì1720) who was the Deshmukh of the town, where there is now a monument to him. In 1713, Shriwardhan was one of the sixteen fortified places in the Konkan ceded by Balaji Vishwanath Peshwa to Kanhoji Angre of Kolaba. Balaji was the first Peshwa of Maratha Empire appointed by Chhatrapati Shahu, grandson of Chhatrapati Shivaji Geography Shrivardhan is located in Raigad District of State of Maharashtra.http://classic.mapmyindia.com/mappage.php?hgtry=sdfghjkl&location;=Shrivardhan&city;=Raigarh+Dist.&state;=Maharashtra&address;=‚òé=&pin;=&x;_pan=200&PC;=&y;_pan=200&scr;_x=258&scr;_y=246&clicked;=&sendmode;=1&zoom;=9&tool;=1 The distance between Shrivardhan and Harihareshwar is 18 km and they are often considered to be twin cities.

History Statue of Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath in Shrivardhan Shrivardhan is one of the oldest towns in Maharashtra. It is a town of Peshwas. The Bhat Deshmukhs of Shrivardhan - later popularly known as Peshwas - witnessed the rise and the fall of Marathas after the Shivaji period. Though the capital of Peshwas was Pune, the actual institution of Peshwa (prime- ministership under a symbolic king) was born in Shrivardhan in 1713. Balaji Vishwanath (the first Peshwa) took control of the position and gained de facto rule in the Maratha empire under the now-symbolic rule of the Chatrapati king. The Peshwas administered the Maratha kingdom for more than 100 years, a period which ended in 1818 following the defeat of the last Peshwa in the Third Anglo-Maratha War. The third Peshwa, Balaji Bajirao, built a huge house here in 1750, which has recently been renovated. The statue of Balaji Vishwanath was also installed here in 1988. The temple in the town - Shri Laxminarayan Temple - is the main temple of Peshwas. The idol in the temple is quite old and is said to be of Hoysala architecture style. The other temples in the town are of Kusumdevi, Somjai, Bhairavnath and Jivaneshwar. Demographics As of the 2001 India census, Shrivardhan had a population of 15,187.

The first descent (or Tanazzul) was to the Luh Al-Mahfuz (Preserved Scripturum) or to 'al-sama‚Äô al-dunya (the ‚Äòlowest heaven‚Äô) and happened in some early, unspecified time. In the second stage, it descended from al-sama‚Äô al-dunya to the worldly realm to be revealed to Muhammad by Gabriel piecemeal in stages (mufarriqan or tafsilan) over 23 years until the whole Quran was completely revealed.Tafsir Muqatil, v.1, 161 Jami‚Äò al-Bayan, v.2, 196-198 Muhammad's first encounter with the archangel produced the first five verses of the ninety-sixth chapter of the present Quran, the chapter of The Clot (Surat al-‚ÄòAlaq)Alfred Guillaume, Sirat Ibn Ishaq, 1995: 105-6Tarikh al-Tabari, v.2, 49Abdul-Rahim, \\"Demythologizing the Qur‚Äôan Rethinking Revelation Through Naskh al-Qur‚Äôan\\", GJAT, 7, 2017: p.62-3 One quranic verse replies to those who ask why the Quran was revealed over time and not all at once: *And those who disbelieve say, \\"Why was the Qur‚Äôan not revealed to him all at once?\\" Thus [it is] that We may strengthen thereby your heart. And We have spaced it distinctly.[Quran 25:32] Some commentators believe that the Quran was revealed to Muhammad twice. In addition to the gradual 23 year revelation until his death, there was an 'immediate revelation' that happened on the Laylat al-Qadr. This is based on an understanding of sura Al-Qadr:1 as referring to descent of the Quran in its entirety. \`Abd Allah ibn \`Abbas reports that, \\"‚Ä¶ descended in Ramadan, on the Laylat al-Qadr in one lay down (jumlah, Ar. ÿ¨ŸÖŸÑÿ©), ‚Ä¶\\" Asbab al-nuzul According to hadith, the circumstances that verses were sent down in, and the study of why and how a particular verses was revealed is known as Asbab al-nuzul (‚Äòoccasions of revelation‚Äô).Abdul-Rahim, \\"Demythologizing the Qur‚Äôan Rethinking Revelation Through Naskh al-Qur‚Äôan\\", GJAT, 7, 2017: p.65-6 Abu al-Hassan Ali bin Ahmad al-Wahidi an-Naisaburi (d. 1075), has been called the father of the field of asbab al-nuzul, he argued that understanding the reasons/circumstances for a given revelation was crucial to resolve apparent inconsistencies in the Quran.Abu al-Hassan Ali Ibn Ahmad al-Wahidi al-Naisaburi, Kitab Asbab nuzul al-Qur'an (Cairo : Dar al-Kitab al-Jadid, 1969), p. 4. cited in According to the scholar al-Suyuti who wrote a book on Asbab al-nuzul, revelations came down for two basic reasons: #\\"divine initiative\\", i.e. because God decided to send and reveal something.

Several advertising agencies or ad networks specialize in IGA, and even more traditional advertising agencies have experimented with IGA.

Reducing advertiser risk Viewer numbers are hard to estimate because it is difficult to gauge the popularity of a game before its release; however, advertiser risk can be partially mitigated through benchmark-based advertisement payments on game units sold or a refund agreement if a certain number of game sales are not reached. This may not, however, protect the advertiser from an unwanted association with a poorly performing game or advertisement. It is also difficult to plan in-game advertisements because game development generally takes longer than the development and implementation of an advertising campaign; typically, most static advertisements must be disclosed to the developers at least eighteen months before a game is released. This timing discrepancy can be solved though use of dynamic advertisements, which are available for purchase at any time in-game space is available, but this choice constrains the advertisement to the in- game predetermined spaces and sizes and does not allow for highly integrated static ads. Game industry reaction Game publishers have mixed feelings about IGA. IGA can create new revenue streams; in some cases publishers‚Äô profits have increased by an extra $1‚Äì2 per game unit sold (in addition to the typical $5‚Äì6 profit per unit).

The general goal of IGA is to insert advertising that gets noticed while not interrupting the player's enjoyment of the game.

In some games it may be easier to rely on revenue from sales of virtual goods, as they may provide a more reliable and greater stream of income than advertising while having the advantage of being directly incorporated into the game experience and being under the complete creative control of the developer. Gamer reaction Gamer reaction to IGA has also been mixed. A 2009 study by an advertising company found that 80% of consumers correctly recalled an advertiser and 56% had a more favorable impression of the advertiser because it allowed them to play a free game. However, companies have found that gamers do not want distracting advertisements when they have already paid the retail price and/or a monthly subscription fee. Gamers have shown a distaste for advertisements that distract them while they are trying to enjoy themselves. A small, 100 participant, 2010 study suggested that gamers may be more likely to favorably respond to advertisements and products which are congruent with the game environment.Ben Lewis, Lance Porter (Spring 2010). ‚ÄúIn-Game Advertising Effects: Examining Player Perceptions of Advertising Schema Congruity in a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game‚Äù.

Grace and Coyle found that 35% of players could recall advertised brands in a controlled study of car racing games. Lee and Faber found that the primary factors for player-retention of IGA are location of brand messages in the game, game involvement, and prior game-playing experience.

Placed along the river Gautami, this erstwhile capital of the Gohil Rajputs, surrounded by hills is situated about 20 km from Bhavnagar. It becomes Sihor by corrupting its name from Saraswatpur, Sinhalpur, Sinhpur, Sinhor, and, Shihor. Regionally, Sihor is all-time famous and known for its hills, their rock pattern, Gautameshwar Mahadev & Lake, Sihor's Festivals, Navnath Pilgrimage (Navnath Yatra) of Shiva Temples, Brahma Kund, 'Sihori Rajwadi Penda' (Peda or Chocolate Cake), old town's ascends and descends, walled city and fort, narrow lanes, Nana Sahib Peshwa and the 1857 revolt, its food and delicacy, Copper-ware & Brass-ware, Pottery, snuff manufacturing factories, Rolling Mills and Industrial Plants. Known as 'Saraswatpur' during Mahabharata period and 'Sinhpur', 'Sinhalpur' after that, locally in Gujarat, it is often regarded as 'Chhote Kashi' (sub-version or model of Kashi - Varanasi - Banaras) also. This may be due to a numerous temples and Shivalayas in and around this medium-sized town, religious activities and resemblance of town's architecture in particular. The town exhibits a definite texture and architecture through a numerous ancient temples and buildings. Etymology The name Sihor evolved from Saraswatpur, Sinhalpur, Sinhpur, Sinhor, and Shihor. Purana, rishis, sages and scholars regarded this place as Pavitra Kshetra attributed by the presence of scholarship and spirituality, such class of society and places out there.  Mythology, progression and Saraswatpur  According to Hinduism, Saraswatpur the name itself may suggest and support to the active power and significance of this place, as a place of knowledge, scholarship and spirituality while deriving from Saraswati the name of Saraswatpur should have been bestowed upon by those responsible. There are references of Saraswatpur in Purana, its references and references of lord Krishna's visits are found in Mahabharata and peculiarly in the texts related to Krishna as Krishna spent the remaining half of his life at DvƒÅrakƒÅ / Dwarka. Another remarkable reference is Gautameshwar Temple, its Swayambhu Shivling in the cave, a proclaimed secret tunneled trek to Somnath from Gautameshwar, inscription and the legend of Gautama Maharishi, Ahalya and lord Rama. According to the legend and ancient inscription, Rishi Gautam's mention of tranquility, vibrations and holiness of this place, its old name as Saraswatpur and the detailed account of his stay, experiences and penance, are found. Even today, the Gautameshwar Mahadev Temple remains a frequently visited place for its tranquil space time, in and around Sihor and in Saurashtra / Gujarat.  Transition and quest  Sinhpur and Sinhalpur are the next to come in picture. Period between Saraswatpur and Sinhpur is not thoroughly referred or documented, and the amount of historical information of this period is in scattered form, to be more precise the period between 5000 BC-3000 BC. Denoting the west coast of India and Kathiawar peninsula, the obvious influence of Indus Civilization on this region can be mapped through further archaeological explorations and insights, and, processing existing archaeological and geological data of Sihor region along with a prime focus on study of Vallabhi and Maitraka era, exploration, survey and excavations targeting the submerged city of Vallabhi which has been critically responsible for Aryan Colonization across the continent with significance of Buddhism and Jainism during that period.  Vedic, Buddhist and Maitraka periods  Periodic excavations and findings, along with few existing ruins and monuments, already ask for thorough validation of their age. Eventually a large portion of Bhavnagar district falling under tectonically unstable zone, possibility of a major natural calamity in form of earthquake, tsunami or volcanic eruption can not be ruled out too. And therefore, the relics and old Vedic civilization may have been a matter of disappearance especially when the Vallabhi and Maitraka dynasty struggled to exist further, either a natural calamity or attacks by barbarians and/or later the known and frequent attacks by Mongols and Turks have to be the reasons behind the diminishing of a flourishing era of this region. Sihor is considered to be a prominent Buddhist circuit from about 5th-6th Centuries BC through Maitraka dynasty (till 8th century). Geologists are of opinion that rocks and the pattern of Sihor hills are unique and the age of this region would be older than that of Himalayas mountain range. The hill range is often observed as an outcome of volcanic activity. While efforts from historians and scholars for validating the research on Vijaya of Sri Lanka and his origin for his voyage to Ceylon in 543BC, the kingdom and dominance of Sinhapur need a greater attention. Its significance and mentions come out evident since early Vedic Period and Gupta empire through Maitraka dynasty during the peak of Vallabhi with its significance as Sinhapur, it should be the period post 6th century, the name Sinhapur would have transformed into Shihor / Sihor.  Lions the identity and, Sinhpur to Sihor  However, the presence of Lions in this region (Sihor hills) from olden times to very much till mid of 20th Century and therefore the gradual social transformation of this piece of civilization into Sinhpur or Sinhalpur may be understandable where the lion is called as 'Sinh' or 'Sinha' in a Sanskrit variant. Adding to the aesthetics of Sinhpur, King Sinhavarma is equally regarded for the Saraswatpur became Sinhpur. There is one more research task in asking toward bridging Sinhpur and Sinhalpur as both of these names have existed, either concurrently or at different points of time. Over the time with varying pronunciations and dialects, it has been found corrupting itself as Sinhor - Shihor and finally Sihor. Interesting to note while Sinhpur becomes Sihor in a few thousand years and lions are returning again to the Sihor hills gradually since last couple of decades and increasing off late, as in the year of 2011. Prince Vijaya, Sinhala, and the Sri Lanka and Buddhism The first king of Sri Lanka, Vijaya the Conqueror, may have been born in ancient Sihor as a prince before being ousted and banished from the region. Other sources however claim he was from Bengal, but after some rectification and cross-verification of all research works covering, Buddhism, Pali/Sanskrit Language, many linguistic-traditional references and connections, Vallabhi, Vijaya's documented route, Geo-political evidences and, documentation & references post Vijaya's settlement in Sri Lanka, all these almost establish that he hailed from Sihor. Period somewhere 600-500BCE through Maitraka dynasty in Vallabhi represents the peak of Buddhism along with Jainism in the region of Sihor and Vallabhi where the rulers were following Vedas and Hinduism but these philosophies co-existed and rather flourished, to the extent, to cross the shores and borders across Indian sub-continent. This is how, Sihor offers some exciting chapters of its connection with Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka's early history and Sinhala people/culture. Sihor while significantly claiming the credits, as Prince Vijaya (later known as Vijaya of Sri Lanka ) exiled from Sihor settled in Lanka, reaching there via sea-route and became medium for introduction of Aryan/Vedic culture and Buddhism in Lanka. This thriving, periodically accomplished research and ancient, popular story is often termed as \\"Lanka Ni Laadi Ne Ghogha No Var\\" meaning \\"Bride of Lanka and the Groom from Ghogha\\" in local culture and literature since very old times. There are couple of films also made on this subject as the title itself and there are few songs woven in folklore depicting the story of Prince Vijay and his succeeding march to Lanka. Ghogha, an all-weather port near Sihor-Bhavnagar, from where prince Vijay set off with his army to Lanka, after he was exiled by his father King Sinhavarma / Sinhabahu from Sinhpur. In ancient times, the region of Gujarat was known as Lata or Lala or Laldesa, which suggests to be Gujarat. Mahavamsa and various references mention of this. Confusion and issues still must be prevailing in settling Vijaya's origin either to North-East or North-West, a significant hindsight is Sinhabahu's who established the Kingdom of Sinhapura in Gujarat west coast, he (Sinhabahu) hailed from Eastern part of Indian subcontinent and thus two different and in fact real historical accounts must create confusion. However, scholars and historians have agreed and reckoned for the evidences to point to Vijaya having come from western coast. Let alone, locally in the present day Saurashtra and Gujarat region, there has been a long carrying telltale and story for several hundred years now about a local Prince called Vijaya to reach Sri Lanka with an army of 700, marry and settle there. Two immigration events, one that is Sinhabahu coming and settling in Sinhapura, Kathiawar - Gujarat from North Eastern coast of India, and his son from Sinhapura, western coast, settling in Sri Lanka, these two different events, the mixed ancestry has influenced the fact of history.  Nana Sahib Peshwa, India's 1857 revolt and after that  A critical fact and secret remains intact, that is Nana Sahib's remnants in Sihor. Undocumented material also suggests Nana Sahib would keep changing his location between Sihor and interior Shatrunjaya Hills around Palitana periodically. However, references, mentions and evidences of Nana Sahib's consistent stay in Sihor have been more dominant and documented in regional records and articles at regular intervals since many decades, for he spent his rest of the life in Sihor, initially as a sage. There were some active freedom fighters and volunteers from Sihor during British rule, and one of them, had he been associated with Nana Sahib is often anticipated to have facilitated Nana Sahib's hideout and his group's safe passage to Sihor during early 60s (1860s), while he would leave Nepal and striving to settle out against British aggression in North India and Kanpur which became evident post 1857. Sihor was a place still quiet, serene, surrounded by hills, with difficult passages and forests stretching up to Girnar range. Religiously to interview the land and region of Kathiawar or the Saurashtra (region), this province often known for its nobility, bravery, sacrifice and spirituality, the place of Sihor in Bhavnagar, Kathiawar, its dormant hills and the jungle surrounding the town may have been a better option and success for Nana Sahib and his allies to settle out there post 1857 revolt and after leaving Nepal. Also with the fact Sihor and its people had continuing connections with Mumbai and various parts of now Maharashtra, which in turn seemed to have helped Nana Sahib to keep a regular touch with few his allies down in Mumbai and Maharashtra. This may be seen from the correspondence, people who kept coming to meet him in Sihor. As per the records of Sihor history, Nana Sahib died in 1909 in Sihor, but curiosity, facts and revelations had started emerging peculiarly post 1947 across the region (Sihor) and Saurashtra, with some official efforts starting toward the 70s (1970s). Subsequently, opening of more links, correspondence, his writings, a few empirical archives, documents with the then state of Bhavnagar, few his rare photographs, some events, altogether a reasonable span of his stay of 45 years in Sihor, and Nana Sahib's local as well as national allies & revolutionaries found reference, nearly to establish without efforts in an unbiased manner, the most probable account of disappearance of this historical figure. Most critically when all these secrets were rather for keeping them as secret and not for the claims, either to prove a personality as Nana Sahib or reveal if it was Sihor which was marked by Nana Sahib's remainder of life, which almost carried along for 45‚Äì46 years. Among the locals, very interesting piece of history referring the remainder, Nana Sahib's life in Sihor, his character, his thoughts and deeds, his subtle nature and identity, his local and general involvement, all these conveyed by those who were close to him directly or indirectly in Sihor, periodically got published in the region. Adding to that, some steps and initiatives taken by him, and the belongings & remnants, these all when acknowledged and realized later, post 1947, eventually to acknowledge they were just Nana Sahib, are all a serious subject of learning and retrospection. This account poses re- evaluation of an incomplete task, a structured approach and serious initiative in asking for the state government of Gujarat and the Central Government, India. Presently, there is a house signified to Nana Sahib in old town of Sihor, remnants and materials, an old tomb as a tribute to him by the locals, a few existing connections/references and recently a recreational park named after Nana Sahib Peshwa in Sihor. Sihor is a Chunval village, about twelve miles north of Viramgam, where, in 1825, were the well-marked remains of an old city. The line of walls could be clearly traced, bricks much larger than those now in use were found, and many bracelets and other ornaments were often dug up. Like Kangavati and Patan, Sihor is, about 300 years ago, said to have been overwhelmed in a storm of dust and sand from the Rann of Kutch. A ruined temple of a Mata bears the date Samvat 1625 (1569). Geography Sihor is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Sihor It has an average elevation of 60 metres (196 feet). Demographics India census, Sihor had a population of 26000.

In Sihor, 12.51% of the population is under 6 years of age. Transportation Air The nearest airport to Sihor is Bhavnagar Airport which has direct flights to Mumbai. Railway Sihor is a railway junction.(SOJN) Sihor is connected to major parts of Saurashtra, Ahmedabad, Mumbai and rest of India by rail. As a Railway Junction in Bhavnagar Division, Sihor got the first rail access (Meter gauge) in form of Bhavnagar State Railway in year 1880 after the Princely state of Bhavnagar became the first in the province and third (after Baroda and Hyderabad) in the country to construct their own railway line. There is direct connection from Sihor to Bhavnagar, Rajkot, Junagadh, Jamnagar, Somnath, Okha, Dwarka, Palitana, Botad, Mahuva, Ahmedabad, Surendranagar, Surat, Mumbai, Delhi, Jaipur, Kakinada, Kochuveli and many intermediate stations. The line has been converted into Broad gauge now. Road By Road, Sihor is connected with all major cities of Gujarat with some direct routes connecting Bhavnagar, Ahmedabad, Rajkot, and with another access to Saurashtra's coastal route via Bhavnagar and access to Vadodara, Mumbai and South India via Dholera Highway. These routes extend and connect to distant places and big centers of Saurashtra and Gujarat. As a popular approach for local and regional transport, people prefer road over rail as the mode of transportation to reach the town quickly. Private public transport is also available frequently to access nearby centers. Places of Historical, Archaeological and Religious significance Gautameshwar Mahadev Temple A medium-sized town drawing a large number of historical and religious places and monuments, many of them religious structures and temples is something interesting and worth studies, it catches to surprise.

The battle was part of the British contribution to the Second Battle of Artois, a Franco-British offensive intended to exploit the German diversion of troops to the Eastern Front. The French Tenth Army was to attack the German 6th Army north of Arras and capture Vimy Ridge, preparatory to an advance on Cambrai and Douai. The British First Army, on the left (northern) flank of the Tenth Army, was to attack on the same day and widen the gap in the German defences expected to be made by the Tenth Army and to fix German troops north of La Bass√©e Canal.  Background  The battle was the initial British component of the combined Anglo-French offensive known as the Second Battle of Artois. The French commander-in-chief, Joseph Joffre, had enquired of Sir John French, commander of the British Expeditionary Force, if British units could support a French offensive into the Douai Plain around late April or early May 1915. The immediate French objectives were to capture the heights at Notre Dame de Lorette and Vimy Ridge. The British First Army was further north, between La Bass√©e and Ypres in Belgium. It was decided that the British forces would attack in the southern half of their front line, near the village of Laventie. The objective, in the flat and poorly drained terrain, was Aubers Ridge an area of slightly higher ground , containing the villages of Aubers, Fromelles and Le Maisnil. The area had been attacked in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle two months earlier. The battle marked the second use of specialist Royal Engineer tunnelling companies, when men of 173rd Tunnelling Company tunnelled under no man's land and planted mines under the German defences, to be blown at zero hour. Prelude German defensive measures The Battle of Neuve Chapelle had shown that one breastwork was insufficient to stop an attack and the fortifications opposite the British were quickly augmented. Barbed-wire entanglements were doubled and trebled and deep breastworks were increased to broad, with traverses and a parados (a bank of earth behind the trench to provide rear protection). Each British battalion had two machine-guns and these were emplaced at ground level, set to sweep no man's land from flanking positions. A second breastwork (the ) begun as part of a general strengthening of the Western Front earlier in the year, about behind the front line was nearly finished. The had dugouts underneath to accommodate and was connected to the front breastwork by communication trenches. Close to the front, the communication trenches were solidly built with concrete shelters and were ready to be used as flanking trenches against a breakthrough. The second line of defence was far enough back from the front line for shells falling on one not to affect the other and the front breastwork became a line of sentry- posts. The second line became the accommodation for the main garrison, which was to move forward during an attack to hold the front line at all costs. About back from the front breastwork, a line of concrete machine-gun posts known as the had been built, about apart, as rallying points for the infantry if the front position was broken through. Opposite Rue du Bois, machine-gun posts were built at La Tourelle, Ferme du Bois () and Ferme Cour d'Avou√© (). Battalion frontages were held by two companies of about on a frontage of , with one company in support to the rear and the fourth company in reserve another back. The new communication trenches were arranged so that the support companies could easily block a break-in from the flanks; most of the field artillery of field batteries and several heavy batteries in each division, were on Aubers Ridge behind the front line, between Lorgies and Gravelin. A second line of gun positions between La Cliqueterie Farm, Bas Vailly, Le Willy and Gravelin, about behind the forward battery positions, had been built so that the guns could be moved back temporarily, until enough reinforcements had arrived from Lille and La Bass√©e to counter-attack and reoccupy the front line.  Battle  Intelligence about the work to improve German positions was not available or given insufficient attention where known. No surprise was achieved because the British bombardment was insufficient to break the German wire and breastwork defences or knock out the German front-line machine-guns. German artillery and free movement of reserves were also insufficiently suppressed. Trench layout, traffic flows and organisation behind the British front line did not allow for easy movement of reinforcements and casualties. British artillery and ammunition were in poor condition: the first through over-use, the second through faulty manufacture. It soon became impossible to tell where British troops were and accurate artillery fire was impossible.  Air operations  Three squadrons of the 1st Wing Royal Flying Corps (RFC) were attached to the First Army for defensive patrols for four days before the attack, to deter enemy reconnaissance. During the attack they were to conduct artillery observation and reconnaissance sorties and bomb German rear areas, railway junctions and bridges further afield.  Aftermath  Analysis The Royal Munster Fusiliers receiving absolution from their chaplain, Father Francis Gleeson prior to the battle}} The battle was an unmitigated disaster for the First Army. No ground was won and no tactical advantage gained. It is doubted if it had the slightest positive effect on assisting the main French attack to the south. The battle was renewed slightly to the south, from 15 May as the Battle of Festubert. In the aftermath of the Aubers Ridge failure, the war correspondent of The Times, Colonel Charles √† Court Repington, sent a telegram to his newspaper highlighting the lack of high-explosive shells, using information supplied by Sir John French; The Times headline on 14 May 1915 was: \\"Need for shells: British attacks checked: Limited supply the cause: A Lesson From France\\". This precipitated a political scandal known as the Shell Crisis of 1915.

Currently the club plays in the Russian Football National League. The name of the club means \\"Torch\\" or \\"Flambeau\\" (). History The club was founded in 1947 at a then classified airplane plant. For secrecy reasons, the team was not officially given a name and was referred to as the Voronezh city team. In 1959 the team became a part of Trud sports society and was renamed Trud Voronezh. In 1976 the team was renamed Fakel. The team played in the Soviet League since 1954: *1954‚Äì1960 in Class B *1961 in Class A *1962 in Class B *1963‚Äì1970 in Class A, Group 2 *1971‚Äì1978 in Second League *1979‚Äì1984 in First League *1985 in Top League *1986‚Äì1987 in First League *1988 in Second League *1989‚Äì1991 in First League The best result of Trud/Fakel was a place in the Top Division in 1961 (finished 15th) and 1985 (finished 17th). Fakel reached the semifinal of the Soviet Cup in 1984. In the Russian league, Fakel played in various divisions, only on two occasions staying in the same division for more than two consecutive seasons: *Top Division: 1992, 1997, 2000‚Äì2001 *First Division: 1993, 1995‚Äì1996, 1998‚Äì1999, 2002‚Äì2003, 2005‚Äì2006, 2011‚Äì2012, 2015‚Äì *Second Division: 1994, 2004, 2010, 2012‚Äì2015 *Russian Amateur Football League: 2007‚Äì2008 The best result achieved by Fakel in Premier League was a 13th position in 2000. Fakel has also experienced several short-lived name changes: to Fakel-Profsoyuz in 1992, Voronezh in 2002 and Fakel-Voronezh in 2002‚Äì2003. Fakel and FC Yelets were excluded from the Russian Second Division for attempts to bribe and threaten the referee on 18 July 2009. At the time of exclusion (21 August), Fakel were sixth with 31 points from 19 games, while Yelets were 16th with 9 points from 19 games. A new club called FC Fakel Voronezh technically independent from the club that played in 2009 as FC Fakel-Voronezh Voronezh was founded in 2010 and played in the Russian Second Division (FSA Voronezh failed licensing for 2010 and the new Fakel was the only Voronezh professional team for 2010). It employed the manager and 6 players from the 2009 FC Fakel-Voronezh roster. The reserve team FC Fakel-d Voronezh played in the Amateur Football League in 2010. Before the 2011‚Äì12 season FC Saturn Moscow Oblast dropped out of Russian Premier League due to financial problems. FC Krasnodar replaced them in the Premier League, creating a vacancy in the Russian First Division. Despite only coming in 4th in their Russian Second Division zone in 2010, Fakel volunteered to take the First Division spot, and the Russian Football Union decided to promote the team. They were relegated back to the third level in the same 2011‚Äì12 season. They returned to the Russian Football National League in the 2015‚Äì16 season. Despite finishing in the relegation zone at the end of the 2017‚Äì18 season, the club was not relegated as other clubs ahead in the standings failed to obtain the league license for 2018‚Äì19. The have finished in the relegation zone once again in the 2018‚Äì19 season, but due to failure of FC Sakhalin Yuzhno- Sakhalinsk and FC Anzhi Makhachkala to acquired a 2019‚Äì20 license, they were not relegated.

Dynamic loads include people, wind, waves, traffic, earthquakes, and blasts. Any structure can be subjected to dynamic loading. Dynamic analysis can be used to find dynamic displacements, time history, and modal analysis. Structural analysis is mainly concerned with finding out the behavior of a physical structure when subjected to force. This action can be in the form of load due to the weight of things such as people, furniture, wind, snow, etc. or some other kind of excitation such as an earthquake, shaking of the ground due to a blast nearby, etc. In essence all these loads are dynamic, including the self-weight of the structure because at some point in time these loads were not there. The distinction is made between the dynamic and the static analysis on the basis of whether the applied action has enough acceleration in comparison to the structure's natural frequency. If a load is applied sufficiently slowly, the inertia forces (Newton's first law of motion) can be ignored and the analysis can be simplified as static analysis. A static load is one which varies very slowly. A dynamic load is one which changes with time fairly quickly in comparison to the structure's natural frequency. If it changes slowly, the structure's response may be determined with static analysis, but if it varies quickly (relative to the structure's ability to respond), the response must be determined with a dynamic analysis. Dynamic analysis for simple structures can be carried out manually, but for complex structures finite element analysis can be used to calculate the mode shapes and frequencies. Displacements A dynamic load can have a significantly larger effect than a static load of the same magnitude due to the structure's inability to respond quickly to the loading (by deflecting). The increase in the effect of a dynamic load is given by the dynamic amplification factor (DAF) or dynamic load factor (DLF): : \\\\text{DAF} = \\\\text{DLF} = \\\\frac{u_{\\\\max}}{u_\\\\text{static}} where u is the deflection of the structure due to the applied load. Graphs of dynamic amplification factors vs non- dimensional rise time (tr/T) exist for standard loading functions (for an explanation of rise time, see time history analysis below). Hence the DAF for a given loading can be read from the graph, the static deflection can be easily calculated for simple structures and the dynamic deflection found. Time history analysis A history will give the response of a structure over time during and after the application of a load. To find the history of a structure's response, you must solve the structure's equation of motion. Example Single degree of freedom system: simple mass spring model A simple single degree of freedom system (a mass, M, on a spring of stiffness k, for example) has the following equation of motion: :M \\\\ddot{x} + kx = F(t) : where \\\\ddot{x} is the acceleration (the double derivative of the displacement) and x is the displacement. If the loading F(t) is a Heaviside step function (the sudden application of a constant load), the solution to the equation of motion is: :x = \\\\frac{F_0} k [1 - \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)] where \\\\omega = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{k}{M}} and the fundamental natural frequency, f = \\\\frac {\\\\omega}{2\\\\pi}. The static deflection of a single degree of freedom system is: :x_\\\\text{static} = \\\\frac{F_0}{k} so we can write, by combining the above formulae: :x = x_\\\\text{static}[1 - \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)] This gives the (theoretical) time history of the structure due to a load F(t), where the false assumption is made that there is no damping. Although this is too simplistic to apply to a real structure, the Heaviside step function is a reasonable model for the application of many real loads, such as the sudden addition of a piece of furniture, or the removal of a prop to a newly cast concrete floor. However, in reality loads are never applied instantaneously ‚Äì they build up over a period of time (this may be very short indeed). This time is called the rise time. As the number of degrees of freedom of a structure increases it very quickly becomes too difficult to calculate the time history manually ‚Äì real structures are analysed using non-linear finite element analysis software. Damping Any real structure will dissipate energy (mainly through friction). This can be modelled by modifying the DAF : \\\\text{DAF} = 1 + e^{-c\\\\pi} where c=\\\\frac{\\\\text {damping coefficient}}{\\\\text{critical damping coefficient}} and is typically 2‚Äì10% depending on the type of construction: * Bolted steel ~6% * Reinforced concrete ~5% * Welded steel ~2% * Brick masonry ~10% Methods to increase damping One of the widely used methods to increase damping is to attach a layer of material with a high Damping Coefficient, for example rubber, to a vibrating structure. Modal analysis A modal analysis calculates the frequency modes or natural frequencies of a given system, but not necessarily its full-time history response to a given input. The natural frequency of a system is dependent only on the stiffness of the structure and the mass which participates with the structure (including self-weight). It is not dependent on the load function. It is useful to know the modal frequencies of a structure as it allows you to ensure that the frequency of any applied periodic loading will not coincide with a modal frequency and hence cause resonance, which leads to large oscillations. The method is: # Find the natural modes (the shape adopted by a structure) and natural frequencies # Calculate the response of each mode # Optionally superpose the response of each mode to find the full modal response to a given loading Energy method It is possible to calculate the frequency of different mode shape of system manually by the energy method. For a given mode shape of a multiple degree of freedom system you can find an \\"equivalent\\" mass, stiffness and applied force for a single degree of freedom system. For simple structures the basic mode shapes can be found by inspection, but it is not a conservative method. Rayleigh's principle states: \\"The frequency œâ of an arbitrary mode of vibration, calculated by the energy method, is always greater than ‚Äì or equal to ‚Äì the fundamental frequency œân.\\" For an assumed mode shape \\\\bar{u}(x), of a structural system with mass M; bending stiffness, EI (Young's modulus, E, multiplied by the second moment of area, I); and applied force, F(x): :\\\\text{Equivalent mass, } M_\\\\text{eq} = \\\\int M \\\\bar{u}^2 \\\\, du :\\\\text{Equivalent stiffness, } k_\\\\text{eq} = \\\\int EI \\\\left(\\\\frac{d^2\\\\bar{u}}{dx^2} \\\\right)^2 \\\\, dx :\\\\text{Equivalent force, } F_\\\\text{eq} = \\\\int F\\\\bar{u} \\\\, dx then, as above: :\\\\omega = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{k_\\\\text{eq}}{M_\\\\text{eq}}} Modal response The complete modal response to a given load F(x,t) is v(x,t)=\\\\sum u_n(x,t) . The summation can be carried out by one of three common methods: * Superpose complete time histories of each mode (time consuming, but exact) * Superpose the maximum amplitudes of each mode (quick but conservative) * Superpose the square root of the sum of squares (good estimate for well-separated frequencies, but unsafe for closely spaced frequencies) To superpose the individual modal responses manually, having calculated them by the energy method: Assuming that the rise time tr is known (T = 2/œâ), it is possible to read the DAF from a standard graph. The static displacement can be calculated with u_\\\\text{static}=\\\\frac{F_{1,\\\\text{eq}}}{k_{1,\\\\text{eq}}}. The dynamic displacement for the chosen mode and applied force can then be found from: :u_{\\\\max} = u_\\\\text{static} \\\\text{DAF} Modal participation factor For real systems there is often mass participating in the forcing function (such as the mass of ground in an earthquake) and mass participating in inertia effects (the mass of the structure itself, Meq). The modal participation factor Œì is a comparison of these two masses.

The work is based on the play of the same name by Jean Cocteau, who, along with French soprano Denise Duval, worked closely with Poulenc in preparation for the opera's premiere. Poulenc's ' was first performed at the Th√©√¢tre National de l'Op√©ra-Comique in Paris on 6 February 1959, with Duval singing the female role and Georges Pr√™tre conducting; the scenery, costumes and direction were by Cocteau. The libretto consists of a woman's last phone conversation with her lover, who now loves someone else. During the call, the woman reveals that she has attempted suicide because her lover has abandoned her. The work has been frequently revived. Sopranos from France, other continental European countries, the UK and the US have performed the solo role, and several of them, beginning with Duval, have recorded it. History Cocteau's play Cocteau finished writing ' in 1928, and the monodrama was premiered two years later. Having been previously criticized for using mechanical effects in his plays, Cocteau sought to reduce his drama to the \\"simplest of forms\\".Waleckx, p. 323 Indeed, the one-act play involves a single character in a single room with a telephone. The character‚Äîan anonymous woman referred to only as \\"Elle\\" (\\"she\\" in French)‚Äîhas been abandoned by her lover and reveals that she has attempted to commit suicide. The play consists of her last conversation with her lover. As a one-act play, the drama lacks the breaks that would traditionally determine its structure. Instead, Cocteau suggests that the actress's different poses represent different \\"phases\\" of the monologue.Waleckx, pp. 323‚Äì325 The structure of the play is further delineated by the phone cutting off frequently without warning.Ivry, p. 200 Motivation Upon the success of his second opera Dialogues des Carm√©lites in 1957, Poulenc was encouraged to compose more works in the genre. Herv√© Dugardin, the Paris director of Ricordi Publishers, suggested that Poulenc set Cocteau's monodrama to music, with Greek-American soprano Maria Callas singing the role of Elle. Poulenc, however, wrote the opera specifically for Denise Duval, who had starred as Blanche de la Force in the Paris Op√©ra premiere of Dialogues. Poulenc's close work with Duval helped his compositional process because he \\"knew the details of the soprano's stormy love life, and this helped to cultivate a sense of specificity in the opera.\\"Ivry, p. 201 Poulenc also identified with Elle's situation, which allowed him to \\"pour immense anguish into his opera‚Ä¶ Like her he abused sleeping pills, tranquilizers and anti-depressants.\\" He thus immersed himself in a deeply personal project with which he easily connected. Adapting Cocteau's text Poulenc met Cocteau early in his career because of the latter's close relationship with Les Six, a group of six French composers of which Poulenc was a member. The two maintained a close friendship throughout their lives, but Poulenc did not set many of Cocteau's texts prior the composition of La voix humaine, about forty years after their first encounter. Poulenc himself explained that he waited so many years to set Cocteau's play because he felt that he needed a great deal of experience to perfectly construct such a work.Hell, p. 278 In composing ', Poulenc strove to maintain the emotional effectiveness of Cocteau's original drama. He very carefully adapted Cocteau's text, omitting only those passages that he believed would reduce the emotional tension of the opera.Waleckx, p. 331 In his article on Poulenc and Cocteau, Denis Waleckx proposes that there are five types of \\"phases\\" in Cocteau's play. These phases deal with chronology, psychological evolution, social interaction, telephone problems, and the \\"remembrance of past happiness.\\"Waleckx, pp. 328‚Äì29 Poulenc left the chronology, telephone problem, and past happiness phases mostly intact, but cut down on or entirely omitted many of the psychological or social phases. This resulted in a protagonist who was \\"quieter, more modest, less hysterical, less unbearable, and thereby probably more touching than Cocteau's.\\"Waleckx, p. 330 Poulenc thereby focused on the relationship of the woman and her lover, while still retaining the key points and overall character of Cocteau's play. Collaboration Poulenc viewed the soprano singing the role of Elle as \\"a co-composer\\" of the part. Because Poulenc wrote the role specifically for Duval, the French soprano was his original \\"co-composer.\\"Ivry, pp. 200‚Äì201 Duval also helped Poulenc with his adaptation of Cocteau's text. Upon the opera's completion, Poulenc and Duval visited Cocteau, who was responsible for directing and designing costumes and stage d√©cor for the premiere. Cocteau worked closely with Duval and adapted his directions for lighting and costuming to complement her physical attributes.Waleckx, p. 343 Premiere Poulenc finished his score for voice and piano on 2 June 1958Machart, p. 212 and spent the next two months orchestrating the work, completing the version for full orchestra on 7 August 1958.Ivry, p. 202 The trag√©die-lyrique was premiered on 6 February 1959 at the Op√©ra-Comique, Paris, with Georges Pr√™tre conducting and Duval performing the role of Elle. The opera met immediate success and went on to be performed at La Scala in Milan, as well as in Portugal, Britain, and the United States. Synopsis The curtain opens to reveal a bedroom where a woman (Elle) lies unmoving on the ground. She changes position once before finally rising. Although she makes to leave the room, the phone rings and she returns to answer it. The woman receives two wrong numbers before her ex-lover is able to get through to her. She lies to him, saying that she went out with her friend Marthe the previous night, and that she took one pill to help her fall asleep when she returned. The couple discuss their past relationship, and Elle blames herself for their problems, claiming, \\"Tout est ma faute.\\"Poulenc, p. 13 Throughout their conversation, they experience numerous telephone problems, and their connection finally cuts out completely. When Elle calls her lover's home phone, she discovers that he is not there and assumes that he is at a restaurant. He calls her back, and Elle reveals that she has lied during their conversation; instead of going out with Marthe the previous night, she took twelve sleeping pills in an attempted suicide. She then called Marthe, who arrived with a doctor to save her. Elle suddenly hears music in the background, and she grows suspicious that her lover is at the home of his new girlfriend. She expresses her suspicions to him several times until the end of the opera, but he never admits to his true location. Elle also reveals her obsession with the telephone, explaining that she has slept with it in her bed for the past two nights. Their connection fails once again, and Elle panics. Her lover calls her back once more, and she informs him that she now has the telephone cord wrapped around her neck. Telling him she loves him over and over, she sinks into her bed and drops the receiver, possibly strangling herself with its cord in the process.Sams, Jeremy. \\"Voix humaine, La,\\" The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, Oxford Music Online, Oxford University Press, retrieved 27 November 2014 Instrumentation La voix humaine is scored for full symphony orchestra with reduced dimensions, so that the sung text is easily understandable.Waleckx, p. 339 The entire orchestra rarely plays at once; such moments occur only when the soprano does not sing, or when her voice lyrically rises above the orchestra. Poulenc writes coloristically, using different combinations of instruments to achieve certain effects. The instrumentation listed in Poulenc's score is as follows: *2 flutes *1 oboe *1 English horn *2 clarinets in B-flat *1 bass clarinet *2 bassoons *2 horns *2 trumpets in C *1 trombone *1 tuba *1 percussion: timpani, cymbals, tambourine, xylophone *1 harp *strings (violins 1 and 2, viola, cello, contrabass)Poulenc, p. vi Musical structure Treatment of the voice Example 1: Poulenc, La voix humaine (1959), 3 after no. 24 Poulenc's writing for the voice is recitative-like in style, representing the natural inflections of speech and, in the case of this particular drama, imitating a phone conversation through its frequent pauses and silences. Poulenc rejects his previous lyricism, opting for a fragmentary, declamatory approach to the voice.Daniel, p. 307 Common characteristics of Poulenc's vocal lines include multiple repeated notes, few intervals greater than a fifth, much step-wise motion and motion by a third, and rhythm and accents designed to reflect actual speech patterns, especially \\"the pauses and hesitations of a phone conversation.\\" Keith W. Daniel notes that out of the 780 measures of music in Poulenc's work, 186 are for solo voice without orchestral accompaniment, adding to the impression of a real telephone conversation. Many of the techniques described above are present in Example 1. Example 2: Poulenc, La voix humaine (1959), 3 before no. 63 Poulenc strays from the recitative in highly dramatic passages, including when Elle sings of her suicide attempt of the previous night.Daniel, p. 308 This section is more lyrical and tonal, as can be seen in Example 2. Here, the vocal line more resembles an aria, especially as it builds toward its high point in the nine-eight measure, and the orchestra accompanies the voice in a waltz. The harmony, meanwhile, is a dominant prolongation in C (minor), and indeed, the orchestra resolves to C (major) in the following measure. Poulenc's vocal writing shows a strong dedication to maintaining the dramatic effect of Cocteau's text. The recitative-like passages clearly deliver the libretto, while the aria-like passages illustrate the soprano's passion and anguish. Treatment of the orchestra Example 3: Poulenc, La voix humaine (1959), no. 1 (\\"Exasperated waiting\\" motif) Poulenc uses the orchestra to connect the soprano's fragmented vocal lines, unifying the piece as a whole.Daniel, p. 309 Unlike his treatment of the soprano voice, Poulenc gives the orchestra many lyrical motifs, writing in the preface his score, \\"L'≈ìuvre enti√®re doit baigner dans la plus grande sensualit√© orchestrale\\" (\\"The entire work must bathe in the largest orchestral sensuality\\").Poulenc, p. vi He unifies the opera through these motifs, of which Denis Waleckx identifies fourteen. These motifs relate to Elle's state of mind, such as those representing her \\"exasperated waiting,\\" and to situations out of her control, such as her \\"happy memory.\\"Waleckx, pp. 338‚Äì339 The first of these motifs is shown in Example 3. Example 4: Poulenc, La voix humaine (1959), no. 41 (\\"Endurance\\" motif) Daniel, however, suggests that only nine of Waleckx's examples are true motifs, while the remaining one- or two-bar phrases employ a cellular technique in which a short phrase is presented, then repeated once or twice.Daniel, p. 311 What Waleckx cites as the \\"Endurance\\" motif (see Example 4), Daniel uses to illustrate Poulenc's cellular technique. Despite their different interpretations, both authors agree that the primary function of the orchestra is to unify the opera into a cohesive work. As Daniel explains, \\"If La voix humaine succeeds as a drama, it is because of the vocal writing; but if it succeeds as a piece of music, as an opera, it is because of the orchestra.\\"Daniel, p. 312 Example 5: Poulenc, La voix humaine (1959), no. 5 Other functions of the orchestra include the representation of Elle's agitation while trying to reach her lover and the jazz she hears on her lover's side of the phone conversation. Musicologist and professor Michal Grover-Friedlander also suggests that the orchestral music can symbolize the lover's side of the phone conversation.Grover-Friedlander, p. 202 Perhaps the most important orchestral function other than unifying the overall work is the portrayal of the telephone ringing through repeated sixteenth notes on the xylophone, shown in Example 5. Although the pitch and the duration of the ringing changes throughout the opera, the timbre of the xylophone is only ever used to represent the \\"voice\\" of the telephone, making it easily identifiable. The phone cutting off and re-ringing divides the opera into natural sections and creates a comprehensible structure through which the audience understands the drama. The orchestra is therefore essential to unifying and organizing the opera. Use of tonality La voix humaine stands out from Poulenc's previous works because it is marked by a certain tonal ambiguity. Poulenc achieves this sensation through the avoidance of traditional harmonic functions and the preponderance of unresolved dissonances, diminished structures, and progressions of chromatically-related chords.Daniel, p. 308‚Äì209 Although some passages‚Äîmost often those in which the voice becomes more lyrical‚Äîhave a clear tonal center, the tonally ambiguous sections are much more frequent in Poulenc's score.Waleckx, p. 340 Grover-Friedlander suggests that the music is motivically, rather than tonally, driven.Grover- Friedlander, p. 203 Yet in these motives, she identifies a number of tonal references, including \\"half steps or leading notes, sevenths, or appoggiaturas, which raise expectations for tonal functioning and tonal resolutions. Poulenc's motivic, cell-like aesthetics does not undermine a sense of totality, but treats it as constantly deferred, or in motion.\\" Poulenc thereby uses tonal techniques in a more modern, tonally ambiguous harmonic language.

It was probably around the size of a large chicken or a guan, weighing not quite . Apparently, as indicated by the ratio of lengths of wing to leg bones, S. sapea was flightless. Its legs were not adapted to running, so it seems to have had a walking lifestyle similar to trumpeters. Unlike other Cariamiformes, which appear to have been mostly carnivorous, Strigogyps specimens suggest a herbivorous diet.Gerald Mayr, Exceptionally preserved plant parenchyma in the digestive tract indicates a herbivorous diet in the Middle Eocene bird Strigogyps sapea (Ameghinornithidae) S. robustus The type species of Strigogyps is S. dubius, which was described by Gaillard in 1908.Gaillard, C. (1908). Les oiseaux des Phosphorites du Quercy. - Annales del'Universit√© de Lyon (Nouvelle S√©rie) 23: 1-178. It was initially placed in the owl order Strigiformes and considered to be a sophiornithid. S. dubius is based on a single tibiotarsus from the Late Eocene to Early Oligocene Quercy phosphorites of France. This tibiotarsus was destroyed in World War II during the bombing of Munich, but casts remain. In 1939, Gaillard described a second species of Strigogyps, S. minor, based on a humerus, two coracoids, and two carpometacarpi, also from Quercy. In 1981, Mourer-Chauvir√© redescribed S. minor as Ameghinornis minor, the only member of the new phorusrhacid subfamily, Ameghinornithinae.Mourer-Chauvir√©, C. 1981.

In 1987, Peters named another monospecific genus of ameghinornithid, Aenigmavis sapea, based on a nearly complete skeleton from the Middle Eocene Messel pit of Germany.Peters, Dieter Stefan (1987): Ein \\"Phorusrhacidae\\" aus dem Mittel- Eoz√§n von Messel (Aves: Gruiformes: Cariamae). Documents des Laboratoires de G√©ologie de Lyon 99: 71-87. [Article in German] Mayr (2005) found Aenigmavis to be a species of Strigogyps, S. sapea, and found Ameghinornis to be synonymous with S. dubius, as they both came from Quercy, and are almost identical except for coracoids and carpometacarpi of Ameghinornis, which Mayr found to be unlike other ameghinornithids, and probably from an idiornithid.

According to one legend, the name Sindkhed is derived from the name of king Sindhurama, who is said to have established this city in ancient time. While other believes that this area was known as 'Siddha Kshetra' (holy land of seers), which over a period of time got abbreviated to Sindkhed. History Not much is known about history of this place in ancient time and the Middle ages. In 1450 A.D., this area was given as jagir to local Kaji by Ala-ud-Din Ahmed Shah Bahmani of the Bahmani Sultanate. By 1550, this area came under rule of powerful Jadhav dynasty, which ruled the paragana of Sindkhed until 1724. During this period, they kept on shuffling their suzerainty with Mughal Empire and Ahmadnagar Sultanate as per situation. Emergence of Nizam of Hyderabad in south India changed political dynamics in this area. The area come under control Nizam by 1724. During the later part of 18th century, this area came under influence of the Shinde dynasty, which ruled it for about 60 years. In 1803, the Nizam of Hyderabad recaptured Sindkhed and restored the rule of Jadhav dynasty. The family lost possessions of the city in 1851 owing to an act of rebellion by Arab troops under their command leading to Sindkhed's downfall. After the decline of the Nizam's rule, this area came under direct British rule.  Tourist attractions   Jijau Palace  Sindkhed Raja is famous for the palace of Lakhojirao Jadhav.

He developed the majority of his work in Andalusia. Biography Siloe was most likely the son of the Spanish-Flemish Gothic sculptor Gil de Silo√©. He spent the first part of his artistic career (1519‚Äì1528) in his birthplace, Burgos, where he worked principally as a sculptor. The works of de Silo√© combine the Italian Renaissance style that he had studied on a visit to Naples around 1517 with the influences of the Spanish Gothic and of Arab architecture in Spain. The gilded staircase of the Burgos Cathedral (1519) is his most important work of this period. Its well-proportioned, round and airy structure with sculptures of cherubs, coats of arms, and vegetal ornamentation, occupies an entire wall of the cathedral. With this design, Siloe resolved the problem that the Coroner√≠a door of the Cathedral, situated in the north arm of the transept, was level with the street but stood several meters above the floor of the Cathedral. The monumental staircase splits into two sections parallel to the back wall, and incorporates architectural elements of the classicist tradition, in the style of the Italian architect Donato Bramante. Nave of the Granada Cathedral. From 1528 until the end of his life, Siloe worked in Granada, above all as an architect. His arrival in the city marks the beginning of classicism in Andalusia. He was commissioned to complete two previously projected projects: the church of the Monastery of Saint Jerome (burial place of the Fern√°ndez family of C√≥rdoba, including the tomb of Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, \\"El Gran Capit√°n\\") and the Granada Cathedral, which he made into two of the outstanding buildings in the Renaissance style in Spain. The monastery church is distinguished by the immense dome covering its central space, after the fashion of funerary buildings of Ancient Rome. The elevations show references to the work of Filippo Brunelleschi, with large pillars fronted by Corinthian half-columns, matching the height of the naves, with a second body of supports over the entablature of the first. Most outstanding is the Portada del Perd√≥n (\\"Door of Pardon\\", c. 1534) conceived as a great triumphal arch. Its rich decoration and the energetic and fluid lines and curves of its interior were an early expression of the Plateresque in Spain. Among his other most notable projects are the Sacra Capilla de El Salvador del Mundo (\\"Holy Chapel of the Savior of the World\\") in √öbeda, conceived as a burial place for the Cobos family. It has a central nave of three wings, side chapels between buttresses, and culminates in a circular space covered by a large dome. Besides the Cathedral of Granada, de Siloe was the primary architect of the Almer√≠a, M√°laga and Guadix Cathedrals in Spain, Guadalajara Cathedral in Mexico, and the cathedrals of Lima and Cuzco in Peru. He was also the sculptor of a notable tomb in Spain's Basque Country, the mausoleum of Bishop Rodrigo Mercado de Zuazola, who was president of the chancery of Granada. Carved from white marble, full of grotesque and allegorical scenes, it stands in the chapel of the Piet√† in the Church the Archangel Michael in O√±ati. He died in Granada.

Comunidades  There are two comunidades, which are ancient self-governing and village- agriculture promotion bodies: Siolim and Marna.  Parishes  There are three parishes in the area: Siolim, Oxel and Tropa. Etymology The name \\"Siolim\\" is believed to have come from two words  'Xinv' and 'Halli' . \\"Xinv\\" (pronounced 'Shiu') means \\"lion\\" and \\"Halli\\" refers to a village or place. This probably means that there once were lions in the hills of Siolim. This origin of the name has been documented in Fr. Moreno de Souza's book.Bardezcheo Igorzo (Churches of Bardez), Fr. Moren De Souza S.J. An argument in favour of this origin is that the village on the other side of the Siolim (not Marna) hill is called Vagali, which could also come from the wrods 'Vag' + 'Halli' (\\"Vag\\" meaning \\"tiger\\" in the local Konkani language).Another explanation is that the name comes from 'Shivalaya' , which means a temple of Shiva, but there is no documented evidence for this origin Churches  Church of Mae de Deus (1568-1600)  The black stone cross from the 147x147pxFranciscan missionaries first built a church - the Church of Mae de Deus - at the Sonarkhett hill, wedged between Siolim and Assagao. It was located centrally to serve the spiritual needs of the people in the villages of Anjuna, Assagao, Siolim and Oxel. But being situated on the rising hill and probably being a makeshift kutcha structure, it did not survive many years, leaving behind the black stone cross at Sonarkhett. This first church in Siolim was built near the site of the Mae de Deus chapel in Gaunsa-Vaddo in 1568. There is a plaque commemorating this fact in the chapel compound. This church was probably a kutcha (temporary) structure, and it survived for merely 32 years. The Gaunsa-Vaddo Chapel of Mae de Deus was constructed in 1847.  St. Anthony's Church (1630-1901) (1902-today)   Miracle  179x179pxSiolim's church is dedicated to St. Anthony of Padua. The church possesses two steeples on the frontispiece and a statue of St Anthony holding a serpent on a leash. This depicts an incident which occurred during the construction of the church when a snake is believed to have been disrupting construction work. The people are said to have interceeded with St. Anthony for help, and placed his statue at the construction site. The next morning, the snake was found caught in the cord placed in the statue's hand. In the church, the statues, paintings, and even the church bell, depict St. Anthony holding a serpent tied with a cord to commemorate this miracle. The First Church: In 1600, the missionaries planned for a new and larger church in another location more central to the Christians of Siolim. But this project is said to have been caught in doubts due to lack of funds. At that time, two Portuguese merchants were caught in a severe storm while sailing from Portugal. They had with them a statue of St. Anthony, and vowed that if they made to port safely, they would build a church where they landed. Siolim shrine in Goa.Their ship is said to have entered the Chapora River and docked on the left bank near the village of Marna. It was here they met the Franciscan missionaries looking out for funds. The new church was dedicated to St. Anthony, instead of Mae de Deus (the Mother of God), and completed in 1630. The Second Church: In the early part of the 20th century, the ravages of time took their toll on the first church of Saint Anthony. Attempts to repair the wall and renovate the roof appeared futile. The whole structure was in danger of collapsing. The parishioners decided to build a new church on the same site. The foundation stone of the church was laid in November 1902. Its consecration took place on 28 December 1907.  Our Lady of Consolation Church  Earlier, the local Christians would attend religious services at the Military chapel at Tropa or Palcho-Vaddo, which was raised to a Church in 1971. During Portuguese rule, this place was well-fortified by the Portuguese with police to ward off the Bhosle attacks. The word tropa which means 'military troops', still survives in the name given to Tropa parish. Its church is dedicated to Our Lady of Consolation.  Our Lady Of The Sea Church  The church at Oxel-Siolim dedicated to Our Lady Of The Sea. Chapels * Mae de Deus Chapel: 147x147pxLocated in Gaunsa-Vaddo, Siolim, opposite Holy Cross Convent.

He has been the member of the National Assembly for Essonne's 8th constituency since 1997 and was previously Mayor of Yerres from 1995 to 2017. A member of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party until January 2007, he then founded the Gaullist and souverainist party Debout la France (DLF; \\"France Arise\\") in November 2008, named Debout la R√©publique until October 2014 and which is closely linked to the European political party Europeans United for Democracy. He ran for President of France in 2012 and 2017 and endorsed the runner-up Marine Le Pen in the 2017 second round. Early life Nicolas Dupont-Aignan was born Nicolas Dupont on 7 March 1961, in Paris. He is the son of Jean-Louis Dupont, who was a wine maker and a Second World War veteran who escaped a German POW camp and Colette Aignan. Dupont-Aignan graduated from Sciences Po in 1982 and acquired his law license in 1984. He graduated with his postgraduate degree from Paris Dauphine University. Dupont- Aignan also attended √âcole nationale d'administration between 1987 and 1989. During his youth, Dupont-Aignan supported the Gaullist politician Jacques Chaban-Delmas and was a member of Rally for the Republic, campaigning for Chaban-Delmas during the 1974 presidential election. Political career  Early years  Dupont-Aignan began his professional career in politics as a civil administrator and working in several ministerial offices, including that of the Minister of National Education and the Environment. Dupont-Aignan joined Rally for France in 1993 and then began serving in Michel Barnier's ministry of the environment in February 1995 though he refused to support either √âdouard Balladur or Jacques Chirac in their presidential campaigns that year. Serving with Michel Barnier, Dupont-Aignan was friendly with multiple Europhile personalities such as Francois Bayrou.  National ascension  Dupont-Aignan speaking during a meeting in 2005 In the early 1990s, the city of Yerres was in 20 million euros in debt following the closure of a major aquatic centre that closed a few months after its opening. In the 1995 municipal elections, Dupont-Aignan was elected with 51.8% of the vote against the then-Socialist mayor. He was also reelected in 2008 with 79.70% of the vote in the first round, giving him one of the biggest margins of victory for a mayor in France. Shortly after becoming mayor, Dupont-Aignan attempted to fix the debt issue by renegotiating the interest rate established with banks, being able to bring the debt from 45 million euros to 34 million euros. Dupont-Aignan took this further by cancelling infrastructure initiatives set by the previous mayor and developed a cheaper, environmentally cheaper plan that included creating communal housing. In terms of environmental policy, Dupont-Aignan reprocessed swimming water to clean streets and his numerous environmental policies were able to win the city awards. On the issue of crime, a municipal police brigade that could patrol the forest areas was created and CCTV was upgraded. This led to Yerres having a significantly lower crime rate than the rest of Essonne. Dupont-Aignan was first elected to the National Assembly in 1997 as the member for Essonne's 8th constituency. He has been reelected every legislative election since. Following the creation of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), Dupont-Aignan ran in the leadership election in 2002 and again in 2004, losing both. Dupont-Aignan also campaigned for a \\"No\\" vote in the 2005 French European Constitution referendum, abandoning perceived Gaullist principles. He was one of the only members of the UMP to vote \\"No\\". Foundation of Debout la France NDA during a Debout la France event in 2011 Following disagreement with the UMP candidate, Nicolas Sarkozy, Dupont-Aignan left the UMP on 13 January 2007. Dupont-Aignan intended to run for the 2007 presidential election but failed to gather the necessary 500 signatures of elected officials. Following his failure to gather the 500 signatures necessary to run, Dupont-Aignan was reelected in his constituency of Essonne 8th though he was no longer a part of the presidential majority due to disagreements with President Sarkozy over taxes and a pro-American foreign policy, voting alongside the Socialist Party on several occasions. Dupont- Aignan eventually founded Debout la France on 23 November 2008 with the ambition of founding a third party that could compete with both the right wing UMP and left-wing Socialist Party who he labeled as being the \\"same\\". Debout la France contested the 2009 European Parliament election, gaining 2.04% of the vote in Metropolitan France. 2012 presidential election Portrait for the 2012 presidential election NDA during an interview with BFM TV in front of the Constitutional Council In November 2010, Dupont-Aignan announced his intention to run for the 2012 presidential election during the annual congress for France Arise, pledging to leave the Euro and return to the Franc, leaving the Euro as a reserve currency. In March 2012 he announced that he had obtained the necessary 500 signatures to run as an official candidate. Dupont- Aignan received 644,043 votes on the first ballot, or 1.79% of the votes cast, finishing seventh. His best showing (24.88%) was in Yerres, of which he was mayor. He did not endorse any candidate for the second round. 2017 presidential election Dupont-Aignan announced his candidacy for the 2017 presidential election during an interview on TF1 on 15 March 2016. Polls taken shortly after gave Dupont-Aignan a voting intention between 3 and 6%. On 7 March 2017, Dupont-Aignan secured the necessary 500 signatures to run in the 2017 presidential election before releasing his manifesto the following day in the form of a book. Shortly after the beginning of the first round, Dupont- Aignan denounced Emmanuel Macron, saying that he \\"served the interests of the rich\\" and accused Serge Dassault, the owner of Le Figaro, of harassing him through text messages in an attempt to get him to renounce his candidacy in endorsement of Fran√ßois Fillon. Le Figaro denies that Dupont-Aignan was harassed though does not deny text messages were exchanged between the two. On 22 April, Dupont-Aignan organised a petition demanding that three televised debates be shown during the first round with all candidates appearing at the debates. Because he was not invited to the first debate, he left prematurely and denounced TF1 for what he called a \\"lack of democracy\\". In the first voting round of 23 April, Dupont-Aignan came in the sixth place, receiving 1,695,000 votes which represents 4.70% of the vote total. Failing to hit the 5% threshold, Dupont-Aignan was not reimbursed for his campaign funds. During an interview on 28 April 2018, he endorsed Marine Le Pen for the second round saying that he would help her with campaigning.http://www.lepoint.fr/presidentielle/second-tour-jour-j-9 28-04-2017-2123318_3121. Marine Le Pen pledged in return to appoint him as Prime Minister of France should she win. The electoral alliance between Debout la France and Front National gathered protesters in Dupont-Aignan's commune, Yerres. Dupont-Aignan was also called a \\"petainist\\" and compared to Pierre Laval. Dupont-Aignan also had dissidents within his own party with his \\"right hand\\", Olivier Clodong, resigning. Dominique Jamet, Vice President of Debout la France, resigned as well. Le Pen lost the vote in the second round of the election against Emmanuel Macron. Dupont-Aignan was reelected during the legislative election of 2017; he resigned as Mayor of Yerres later that year and was succeeded by Clodong. Political positions Dupont-Aignan describes himself as a Gaullist. . Although he shares many policies and views with Marine Le Pen, he is considered less hardline than she and has criticised her in the past. Dupont-Aignan strongly advocates leaving the euro, calling it a \\"racket\\", and returning to the franc, retaining the euro only as a reserve currency. Dupont-Aignan has also voiced his support for Rattachism.  Personal life  Dupont-Aignan is married to lawyer and former parliamentary assistant, Val√©rie Vecchierini. The couple have two daughters, Victoire and Sixtine. Dupont-Aignan declared during the 2017 presidential election that he was worth more than 2 million euros. He had also declared in 2013 that he has a house worth ‚Ç¨130,000 in Yerres and an apartment in Paris worth ‚Ç¨420,000.

On 17 November 2007 Arthurs pleaded guilty to the charges of murder and unlawful detention and was convicted in the Supreme Court of Western Australia; he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 13 years.\\"Arthurs pleads guilty to Sofia murder\\". Retrieved 17 September 2007 He is currently in detention in Casuarina Prison and was eligible for parole in 2019, however his parole bid was dismissed in June 2019 and he will not be eligible for reapply for parole until 2022. Many areas of the Western Australian and Australian community debated the re-introduction of the death penalty due to the emotion evoked by Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu's murder. The last person hanged in Western Australia was Eric Edgar Cooke in 1964 and the death penalty was repealed in that state in 1984. Crime At 4:00pm on 26 June 2006, Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu was at the Livingston Shopping Centre in Canning Vale with her uncle, sister and brother. While her family waited in the main area of the shopping centre, Sofia went down a corridor to go to the toilet. Arthurs, an employee at the shopping centre, followed her, and after she left the female toilets, grabbed her from behind, dragged her into the nearby disabled toilet cubicle, and locked the door. Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu's family, having waited only a few moments, became concerned and her 14-year-old brother was sent to look for her. He called for her at the door of the female toilet but not getting a response walked back along the corridor. He heard movement coming from the disabled cubicle and knocked on the locked door calling Sofia's name. There was no response. Sofia's brother, uncle and younger sister then began a search of the centre. A few minutes later, her brother again returned to the disabled toilet cubicle and opened the now unlocked door. It was at this time, only 10 minutes after Sofia left her family that her brother found her naked body lying on the cubicle floor. A search of the shopping centre failed to locate an offender, and the entire centre was closed and declared a crime scene. While Arthurs was restraining her and removing her clothes her limbs became so severely contorted that both her legs were broken and her left arm was dislocated. Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu's throat was also severely compressed and her larynx was crushed as Arthurs attempted to muffle her cries. She also received a severe perineal tear. The cause of her death was given to be a direct result of strangulation. Criminal investigation Initial investigations at the shopping centre identified a few possible suspects. Arthurs was known to local detectives due to a sexual assault on an eight-year-old girl in the same area three years earlier. Police remained at the crime scene well into the early morning and at 5:00am the day after Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu's body was discovered, they attended the home of Arthurs who lived with his parents a few hundred metres from the shopping centre. After a search of his home, Arthurs was arrested and later charged with wilful murder, two counts of sexual penetration of a child, and deprivation of liberty. In his interview with police, Arthurs admitted to digitally penetrating Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu, however it could not be determined whether this had occurred prior to or after her death. During the attack, which was estimated to have lasted between 3 and 5 minutes, Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu's brother knocked on the door of the cubicle having heard movement coming from inside while searching for her. Though Arthurs made admissions to hearing the knock on the door and a name being called, neither he nor the police could identify whether Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu was still alive at that time. Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu was left naked and dead or dying on the floor as Arthurs made his escape. Legal controversy Once the news of Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu's murder spread and information about her alleged killer was revealed, media organisations locally, nationally and internationally took great interest. The crime was described in many news reports as the most horrific murder in Western Australia since the David and Catherine Birnie murders in the 1980s. Western Australia police were required to quash strong rumours that Arthurs was one of the child murderers convicted of the murder of James Bulger in the United Kingdom in 1993. It was alleged that Arthurs was in fact Robert Thompson, who at the age of 10 years was convicted of Bulger's murder, given a new identity and then transported to Australia. Information was revealed publicly by the Western Australian and Australian Federal Police that Arthurs was not Thompson and the rumour gathered no more momentum. On 29 June 2006, the British High Commission in Canberra issued a media release stating \\"There is no connection between the man arrested in Western Australia and the individuals involved in the James Bulger case.\\" Australia has not taken British convicts since 1868.http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/on-this-day-in-history- australias-last-convict-ship-docks.htm Further controversy arose when information was revealed in the local media that Arthurs had been investigated for a sexual assault 3 years earlier in 2003, against another 8-year-old girl. It was outlined in media reports and later confirmed by Western Australia Police Commissioner Karl O'Callaghan and the Director of Public Prosecutions, that Arthurs was in fact arrested for the assault, however charges were dropped due to insufficient evidence and incorrect police interviewing techniques. At the time of Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu's murder in 2006, the 2003 assault was re-opened to identify any possible links. It was then identified that the shorts worn by Arthurs in the 2003 assault had traces of the victim's blood on them that wasn't noticed during the 2003 investigation. Western Australia Police received public condemnation for failing to have the shorts forensically examined, which could have secured the conviction of Arthurs for the 2003 assault and therefore could have avoided Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu's murder. It was also confirmed that after the 2003 assault, the Director of Public Prosecutions refused to consider charges against Arthurs because they considered that the police had been too robust in interviewing him and that a conviction was unlikely to be obtained. Though Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu's family were frustrated by this discovery, they publicly supported the police and understood that a successful conviction against Arthurs (if in fact it did occur) in 2003, would not have guaranteed their daughter would still be alive today. Legal proceedings Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu's family were devastated by their daughters' murder and could not face the prospect of the court process. They were unable to attend any of the proceedings and so were represented by two members of the Mater Christi Catholic Primary School Parish, a school that Sofia attended in the suburb of Yangebup. Head priest at the Parish, Father Bryan Rosling took up the family's struggle to deal with the massive media attention the murder had raised. Paul Litherland, a Western Australian police officer and a parent of one of Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu's schoolmates, represented the family and set up fund raising events. On 7 March 2007, after extensive psychological testing and discussions between prosecutors and Arthurs' defence counsel, Arthurs was required to enter a plea to the charges of wilful murder, two counts of sexual penetration of a child, and unlawful detention. He pleaded not guilty to all four charges and was remanded in custody. On 31 August 2007, Justice Peter Blaxell ruled that the bulk of the admissions made by Arthurs in a video recorded interview with police on the morning after the offence, would be inadmissible at his trial on ground of \\"persistent importunity, or sustained or undue insistence or pressure\\".. Arthurs was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome by forensic psychologist Greg Dear. On 31 July 2007, Chief Justice Wayne Martin ruled that Arthurs would receive a bench trial. Martin said that the \\"extensive, continuous and in some respects extraordinary\\" pre-trial media coverage, the circumstances of the offence and the fact that a judge would provide reasons for his or her decision supported a trial by judge alone. Hence it was agreed that Arthurs would be heard by a judge alone and not a jury. In the meantime, discussions continued with the Director of Public Prosecutions and Arthurs lawyers regarding his plea status. In August 2007, Arthurs and prosecutors entered into an agreement that would see Arthurs plead guilty to the lesser charge of murder, instead of the current charge of wilful murder. On 17 September 2007, Arthurs pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court to charges of murder and unlawful detention. The two counts of sexual penetration of a child under the age of 10 were withdrawn because forensic analysis could not conclude if Rodriguez- Urrutia Shu had been sexually assaulted before or after she died. On 7 November 2007, Arthurs was sentenced to life in prison with a non-parole period of 13 years. He was also sentenced to two years for depriving Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu of her liberty. Describing Arthurs' crimes as \\"so evil they shock the public conscience\\", Justice John McKechnie also advised Arthurs of the possibility that he may never be released as the release of offenders sentenced to life imprisonment must be signed off by the Western Australian Attorney-General. Other allegations After Arthurs pleaded guilty it was publicly confirmed that he was under investigation by British police for sexually assaulting another girl in 2001. Arthurs was never charged with this incident because he left Britain for Australia before an identity parade could take place. Sofia Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu's legacy The Chapel of the Innocents Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu's small school community was devastated by her murder and set about to raise funds for a memorial to her at the school. Over A$250,000 was raised locally at the school for a memorial to Sofia and all Western Australian children who have had their lives stolen by criminals. The Chapel of the Innocents was constructed in 2008 and is the resting place of her ashes. Changes to legislation After Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu was murdered, police were restricted in their ability to charge Arthurs with wilful murder, because it could not be proved it was his intention to murder her. Wilful murder, which carried a term of life imprisonment with a non- parole period of 15 years (minimum) to 19 years (maximum) at the time, was the highest charge that could be preferred for the taking of a life. Instead, Arthurs had to be charged and convicted with the lesser offence of murder, which excluded the element of intent. This still carried a penalty of life imprisonment, however the non-parole periods were 7 years (minimum) to 14 years (maximum). For what many considered as one of the most horrific crimes in Western Australia for decades, Arthurs could possibly spend only 7 years in jail. This caused a massive public outcry and a demand was made to force a change to the laws for murder in Western Australia. Through the then Attorney General Jim McGinty, Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu's family and their many supporters petitioned the Government to have the laws changed to reflect more clearly the seriousness of the crimes committed. As a result, the charges of wilful murder and murder were repealed and a single charge of murder was created to include more severe penalty options. Though a distinction between an intent to murder and non-intent was still included, the sentencing considerations were dramatically altered. The new legislation calls for an ability to impose a \\"never to be released\\" clause as well as a change in the minimum sentence that can be imposed before release on parole can be considered. For murder with intent the minimum sentence is 20 years and for murder without a proved intent (manslaughter) it is 15 years. Sex offender register In addition to the changes to murder legislation, Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu's family has worked to have the Western Australian Government introduce a public sex offender register. This would see the names and suburbs (but not addresses) of convicted sex offenders being made available to the public. Though public support was very strong for such a register, the government stalled on the legislation due to the concerns such legislation could cause to the safety of known sex offenders. Police in particular showed concerns for the fear of vigilante attacks against sex offenders who have been released after serving their time in jail. In November 2011 the government of Western Australia passed legislation in the lower house for a register. It is envisioned that serious and repeat offenders will have their names and suburbs published on a public website. Furthermore, parents will be able to check if people who have regular contact with their children are on the sex offenders register. This will be by way of providing the person's details to police. In June 2012, the Western Australian sex offender register was enacted as legislation. On 15 October 2012, the register went live. Parole attempt In June 2018, the 12th anniversary of Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu's murder, a public petition was initiated in preparation for Arthurs' first parole hearing scheduled in early 2019. On 26 June 2019, Arthurs would be eligible for parole, having served a 13-year minimum term of imprisonment. The petition addressed current Attorney- General of Western Australia John Quigley and called on support from the public for the non-release of Arthurs, regardless of his eligibility for parole. Within a few days the online petition had gathered 75,000 signatures, and over the following two weeks it grew to 100,000 signatures. The petition gained strong media attention in Western Australia and reflected public concern that Arthurs may be released prior to his maximum term of imprisonment having been served. Many members of the public were shocked that it had already been 12 years since Rodriguez-Urrutia Shu was murdered. The media attention drew public comment from Quigley, who stated \\"the wishes of Sofia's family will weigh heavily in any decision I might make regarding this shocking case.\\" On 20 June 2019, Attorney-General Quigley supported a recommendation by the Western Australian Prison Review Board that Arthurs not be released into the community. Arthurs will not be eligible for parole again until 26 June 2022.

He was skilled in a style of dancing that he performed in a wooden sandbox of his own construction, and acquired his nickname from the sand he sprinkled to alter and amplify the sound of his dance steps. \\"They called the board my Stradivarius,\\" Sims said of his sandbox. From the 1950s to the year 2000, Sims was a regular attraction‚Äîa \\"fixture\\"‚Äîat Harlem's noted Apollo Theater, comedically ushering failed acts offstage with a hook, broom or other prop. He was also involved in New York City's Hoofers Club, a venue primarily for black tap dancers. As part of the resurgence of interest in tap dancing in the 1980s, Sandman Sims served as a cultural ambassador, representing the United States with dance performances around the world. He was featured in the 1989 dance film Tap, along with Sammy Davis Jr., Gregory Hines and Savion Glover, demonstrating classic challenge dancing. Sims also appeared in a 1990 episode of The Cosby Show as Rudy's tap dancing teacher, facing off against Cliff (Bill Cosby) in a good-natured tap challenge. In her review of the play based on his life, New York Times critic Anna Kisselgoff wrote, \\"Sims is a virtuoso among virtuosos‚Äîin a class by himself. To say Mr. Sims dances on sand is like saying Philippe Petit [the French high wire who gained fame from his illegal walk between the two World Trade Center towers in 1974] is a tightrope walker.\\"  Early life  Sims was born in Fort Smith, Arkansas on January 24, 1917, one of 12 children. The family soon relocated to Los Angeles, California, where he was raised. Describing his childhood, Sims said, \\"It was just a whole big dancing family.\\" He learned to dance from his father, and said he was dancing as soon as he could walk. He began tap-dancing at the age of 3. He attributed some of his early love for tap dancing in particular to his mother, exasperated that he kept wearing out the toes of his shoes, putting steel taps on the shoes. Along with his brothers, Sims was dancing on the sidewalks of Los Angeles from a young age. At the age of 14, peeping in the windows of a dance school got Sims arrested for loitering, but he was able to dance his way to freedom, convincing a judge that his reason for being on that street was legitimate. As a young man, despite his dance talent, Sims aspired to be not a professional dancer, but a professional boxer. After twice breaking his hand, he decided he needed a different means of making a living. Sims had noticed that boxing audiences reacted positively to the way he would dance in the rosin box before getting into the ring, and especially to the distinctive sound his dancing made moving the rosin granules around the wooden box. He began to consider dancing as a career alternative. Sims experimented with several different methods of reproducing the rosin box effect, gluing sandpaper to either his shoes or his dancing mat, but the sandpaper created too much wear on the other surface. Finally he found the solution: loose sand in a low-lipped box. \\"People went for the scraping sound ... So I made a sound board by sprinkling sand on a flat platform. That was in 1935.\\" His sandbox remained his trademark throughout his career, with some venues even telling Sims, \\"If you don't bring your sandbox, don't come at all.\\" During this period, it was common for dancers to carry tap shoes with them and, when they encountered another dancer on the street, throw down their shoes by way of challenge. The culture of street dancing in the 1920s has been compared to the rise of break dancing six decades later. As the journal Jump Cut described it, \\"'challenge dancing,' in which each performer tries to outdo the other, is part of tap dancing's heritage, something like the jazz solos in which musicians try to outshine one another.\\" Sims later described how the atmosphere of these dance challenges was at least as much collegial as combative, and how dancers learned from one another in what became essentially \\"open air dance schools\\". Despite performing at various vaudeville venues, Sims found neither fame nor success as a dancer in Los Angeles. In 1947, he tagged along on one of his professional-boxer friend Archie Moore's cross- country drives, and settled in New York City.  Harlem  After arriving in Harlem, Sims began performing on the street as he had done in California, but faced stiff competition from other innovative dancers: \\"I knew people who danced on dinner plates. ... There was a man who could dance on newspapers without tearing them. And another who constructed a gigantic xylophone to tap on.\\" He performed on corners in between working whatever jobs he could find, and then discovered the \\"Amateur Night\\" stage on Wednesdays at the Apollo Theater, where he soon gained local notoriety. He eventually won the Amateur Night competition a record-breaking 25 times, after which a rule was instituted that performers could no longer compete once they had earned four first prizes. > When big name dancers played The Apollo, there was nothing in the audience > but dancers with their shoes,\\" said Sandman Sims. \\"Up in the balcony > dancers, and the first six rows, you saw nothing but tap-dancers, want-to-be > tap-dancers, gonna-be tap-dancers, tried-to-be tap-dancers. That's the > reason a guy would want to dance at The Apollo. By the mid-1950s, he had been hired as the Apollo's stage manager, and soon began his role as the Apollo's famed \\"executioner\\", chasing Amateur Night contestants the crowd disapproved of off the stage with a shepherd's crook (known since vaudeville times as \\"the hook\\") a broom, or other props, while dressed in a variety of wacky costumes, whether long underwear, a clown suit, or even a diaper. Backstage, however, he would console defeated contestants with the story of his having been booed off ten times before he finally got to finish his own act. Sims would play \\"executioner\\" until shortly after Time Warner took over the Apollo in 1999. Having found work dancing did not stop him from dancing on the street, however. \\"If I saw a dancer, I'd challenge him. I didn't care who it was. The way to get known in New York was to be the best. That's what I strived to be.\\" Part of the culture of street challenges, as in Los Angeles, was that competing dancers would also learn from one another. A significant change to Sims's dancing style came about as a result of his interaction with Harlem's hoofers, practitioners of a variation on the tap he had learned on the west coast. Sims would later define the main difference between tap and hoofing as being that tap focuses on the heel and toe whereas hoofers \\"use the whole foot\\". As a result of the synergy between hoofing technique and his unique use of a sandbox, his routines were described as being \\"as rich in sounds and textures as they were in steps.\\" Sims himself put it, \\"The feet are a set of drums.\\" Constance Valis Hill, in her 2009 survey Tap Dancing America: A Cultural History, described the hoofers' mecca thusly: > At the Hoofers Club, rookie and veteran, mostly [B]lack male tap dancers > assembled to share with, steal from, and challenge each other; there, new > standards were set for competition. These were nothing like the formalized > buck-dancing competitions of Tammany Hall, where judges sat beside, before, > and beneath the stage to evaluate the [dancers'] clarity, speed, and > presentation. The Hoofers Club comprised a more informal panel of peers, > whose judgments could be cruel and mocking and were driven by an insistence > on innovation. \\"Survive or die\\" was the credo. In an eccentric fusion of > imitation and innovation, young dancers were forced to find their style and > rhythmic voice. It was said that on the wall of the Hoofers Club was > written: \\"Thou shalt not copy each other's steps ‚Äî Exactly.\\" Though he frequently took opportunities to explain the difference between tap and hoofing to the press in later years, and tended to refer to himself as a hoofer rather than a tap dancer, Sims did practice both forms of dance. In 1949, motivated by the death of Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson, Sims became a founding member of the Original Copasetics, another fellowship of tap dancers that became a source of mentor-student relationships and would help bring about the revival of tap in the 1970s and 1980s.  Decline and revival of tap  Tap dancing lost popularity with audiences beginning in the late 1940s. A number of causes factored into this decline, among them the going out of style of vaudeville-style variety shows; a new tax that forced many ballrooms to close and thus closed venues to the big bands with whom tap dancers had used to perform; trends in music that favored smaller, more intimate groups of performers; and concomitant increases in interest among audiences in watching formal modern dance and ballet performances. Sims was quoted as having said of the period that \\"[t]ap didn't die ... It was just neglected.\\" With paying gigs harder to find and paying less, Sims turned to other sources of income. Despite not having had any formal instruction himself, he taught dance, including to such later stars as Gregory Hines and Ben Vereen. He also taught footwork to boxing greats Sugar Ray Robinson and Muhammad Ali. Less glamorously, he ran a caf√©, and even worked as a carpenter and a mechanic. Despite the lean times for hoofers, Sims was always able to put food on the table for his family, having married in 1959. The late 1960s brought the beginning of a wave of nostalgia for tap, and Sims found his dance skills in demand again. In 1969, he was part of the all-star cast of Tap Happening, a revue that played Off-Broadway. Tap Happening was popular enough to run for several years. The crescendo of interest in tap dancing continued, and in 1972, Sims danced in the production Best of the Hoofers at the Orpheum Theatre. \\"Hoofing is not a dying art form,\\" he asserted in 1977, and subsequent events would prove him right. 1979 saw the release of No Maps on My Taps, which featured Sims facing off against fellow tap stars Chuck Green‚Äîwho had served as Sims's mentor during his early years in New York‚Äîand Bunny Briggs, in a three-way dance challenge. The documentary also reunited him with bandleader Lionel Hampton, whom he had toured with in years past. In 1980, a far cry from the tiny venues he had been lucky to play just a few years earlier, Sims performed before a crowd of 2,600 fans at the Lincoln Center during the Newport Jazz Festival. Later that year, Sims was one of the instructor-performers of the By Word of Foot \\"teach-in\\" series, spending a week demonstrating his hoofing techniques for a new generation of tap enthusiasts. As part of New York's leg of the 1981 Newport Jazz Festival (which spanned both NYC and its home city of Newport, Rhode Island, that year), he performed with former Cotton Club bandleader Cab Calloway in a production called Stompin' at the Savoy. A few weeks later, Sims was on stage at the American Dance Festival, dancing both with and without his sandbox. By 1982, Sims was part of a promotional tour reviving interest in No Maps on My Taps with co-stars Bunny Briggs and Chuck Green, their pre-screening performances backed by Cab Calloway. Even as booked performances were coming more regularly, Sims never stopped participating in street-corner challenges, encouraging younger generations of dancers and inviting them to learn his moves. The National Endowment for the Arts granted Sims a $5,000 National Heritage Fellowship in 1984. \\"I thought I was making noise all these years,\\" Sims said of the award. \\"Now they're calling it culture.\\" He used the funds to teach dance to children in Harlem, using a parking lot in lieu of a formal dance studio, drawing on his own youth learning dance on the street. Sims would later explain, \\"most people wait [to study dance] until after they've grown up‚Äîand then it's too late.\\" That same year, clogger Ira Bernstein received an NEA Folk Arts Apprenticeship grant \\"[t]o study traditional [B]lack tap dance with master dancer Howard 'Sandman' Sims.\\" Sims loved to teach; his son recounted how Sandman would \\"stop every kid he saw and show them a step and get them to copy a step. He enjoyed that more than performing in front of an audience.\\"  The Apollo reopens  Meanwhile, Harlem's Apollo Theater, where Sims had served for years as Amateur Night's \\"executioner\\", had been closed for most of a decade. Then, following an extensive renovation, the venue reopened in 1985, bringing increased attention to both the Apollo and his role there. \\"I'm their protector, not the executioner,\\" he explained to The Washington Post. \\"Because that audience can get really hostile.\\" Sims described seeing displeased audiences throw bottles and even horseshoes at performers who he did not hustle off stage fast enough. When The New York Times interviewed him about his \\"executioner\\" role, he said of the acts that got booed off, \\"I tell them to work on their act and come back,\\" encouraging them to try again. In 1986, Sims starred in The Tap Tradition at Symphony Space New York (which also hosted a showing of No Maps on My Taps), earning a rave review from The New York Times. He also made a brief appearance in a play based on his life, The Sand Dancer, which was written by poet Sandra Hochman and starred LeLand Gantt, and which received another rave review: \\"Sims is a virtuoso among virtuosos‚Äîin a class by himself. To say Mr. Sims dances on sand is like saying Philippe Petit is a tightrope walker.\\" And he traveled to Los Angeles to perform in a production called Essence of Rhythm with fellow tap stars including Charles \\"Honi\\" Coles and Jimmy Slyde. Sandman Sims was the guest star of Late Night with David Letterman on May 14, 1987. It's Showtime at the Apollo, a TV broadcast of the Apollo Theater's Amateur Night performances, began broadcasting in September 1987 on NBC stations, bringing awareness of Sims's \\"executioner\\" role to a wider audience. A particularly busy year, 1988 saw Sims tour the world as a cultural ambassador on behalf of the U.S. State Department, traveling to over 50 countries in a span of 11 months. By 1989, Sims's popularity was at an all-time high, and he told the Associated Press, \\"I can't fulfill all the work they give me. ... I can't walk out on the street without somebody showing me a time step.\\" Tap dancing's popularity was nearing a new peak as well, with three major American cities (Houston, Texas; Portland, Oregon; Washington, D.C.) hosting tap-dance festivals. In movie theaters, the dance drama Tap was introducing Sims's footwork (and that of his former student Gregory Hines) to audiences who had never had the opportunity to see him perform before. Playing a thinly- fictionalized version of himself named \\"Mr. Sims\\", Sims made a 1990 appearance on The Cosby Show, then one of the most popular programs on television. \\"Mr. Sims\\" was the dance instructor the Huxtables signed their young daughter Rudy up with in order to help her prepare for a class assignment about the Harlem Renaissance. During the episode, Cliff Huxtable (Bill Cosby) challenged \\"Mr. Sims\\" to a dance-off, part tribute to and part parody of Sims's real-life tap challenges, which Sims won handily. Later that same year, the Apollo Theater played host to Rat-a-Tat-Tap, another tap-dance festival, and the Sandman, \\"always a deserved audience favorite at tap festivals,\\" was a featured performer there alongside his Tap co-stars Savion Glover and Gregory Hines. Sims was a featured performer at the third annual celebration of National Tap Dance Day on May 30, 1993. In 1998, the New York Committee to Celebrate National Tap Dance Day and the Young People's Tap Conference honored Sandman Sims for his contributions to the art of hoofing.  In popular culture  Sandman Sims, particularly in his role as Apollo Theater executioner, has been referenced frequently in African-American culture. * On April 5, 2000, he was invoked by Huey Freeman in the long-running comic strip The Boondocks, who responded to an ineptly-told joke by saying, \\"Where is Sandman Sims when you need him ...\\" * Performance artist Holly Bass, along with other dancers, put on another play about Sims's life at the Smithsonian Institution's American History Museum (which was then hosting an exhibit on the Apollo Theater) on July 10, 2010. * President Barack Obama, referring to his own performance singing on the Apollo Theater stage (albeit not on Amateur Night) the evening before his 2012 State of the Union address, said, \\"Sandman did not come out!\\"  Personal life  While Sims had a first marriage which produced his first child Diane Sims, he later married his second wife, Solange. They would have a son together, Howard Sims Jr., as well as five grandchildren and a great- grandchild. Particularly in later years, Sims sometimes claimed not to be certain of his birth year, at times saying it was \\"a matter of opinion.\\" Asked by a fan how old he was, Sims once replied, \\"Any number can play.\\" Sims died on May 20, 2003 in New York City. He had suffered from Alzheimer's disease. A memorial service for Sims was held May 28, 2003 at the Apollo Theater.

Etymology According to popular notion, the present name of the city, Sirhind, comes from 'Sar-i hind', meaning the Frontier of Hind, as Mughal saw it as the 'gateway to Hindustan'.Memories of a town known as Sirhind The Sunday Tribune, 15 April 2007.Sirhind Town(Sahrind) The Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 23, p. 20. However, a 5th-century AD tribe 'Sairindhas Aryans, which inhabited this area, might have also led to its present name. History Varahamihira (505 ‚Äì 587) in his Sanskrit treatise, Brihat Samhita, mentions the city as 'Satudar Desh', later it was inhabited by a tribe of 'Sairindhas Aryans, leading to its present name.District at a glance Sirhind at fatehgarhsahib.nic.in According to Huan Tsang, the Chinese traveller who visited India during the seventh century, Sirhind was the capital of the district of Shitotulo, or Shatadru (the present day River Sutlej).Huan-Tsang Entrance to the Ramgarh Fort near Sirhind In 12th century, Sirhind came under the rule of the Hindu Chauhan Gurjars of Delhi.  Punjab Government Website During the rule of Prithvi Raj Chauhan (1168‚Äì1192), the Hindu Gurjar ruler of Delhi, it became his military outpost. It further rose in glory during the Mughal Empire, when it became its provincial capital, controlling the Lahore- Delhi Highway, the Grand Trunk Road. During the Mughal era, Sirhind was the name for Malwa, since it was the area's capital city. Sirhind was the headquarters of the Mughal administration in Eastern Punjab. Many European travellers describe its splendours, and it also developed into a center of cultural activity. Ruins of Daulat Khana-E-Khas at Aam Khas Bagh', built by most probably, Sultan hafiz Rakhna, during the reign of emperor Akbar Sirhind was known for the dozens of saints, scholars, poets, historians, calligraphers and scribes who lived there. This city is mostly famous to Muslims for Great saint ImƒÅm-e-RabbƒÅnƒ´ Shaykh Ahmad al-Far≈´qƒ´ al-Sirhindƒ´ (R.) (1564‚Äì1624). He was an Indian Islamic scholar of Arab origin, a Hanafi jurist, and a prominent member of the Naqshbandƒ´ Sufi order. A large number of buildings survive from this period, including the fort named 'Aam Khas Bagh'; it is said that in its heyday, the city had 360 mosques, gardens, tombs, caravansarais and wells. Younger sons of tenth Sikh guru Sri Guru Gobind Singh ji namely Baba Zorawar Singh ji and Baba Fateh Singh ji were bricked alive at the age of 9 and 7 years respectively by then governor Wazir Khan. Gurudwara Sri Fatehgarh Sahib is established at that place to commemorate them. Baba Banda Singh Bahadur in 1710 destroyed the city of Sirhind completely and killed Wazir Khan the governor. The Sikhs occupied Sirhind and made Bhai Baj Singh Ji the governor.

It is situated south-west of Boston, north of Spalding and north-west of Holbeach. The parish includes the villages of Gosberton Clough and Risegate, and the hamlets of Westhorpe and Gosberton Cheal. The population of Gosberton, which was approximately 2500, increased to 2,958 at the 2011 Census. The village was skirted by the A16 road but has been bypassed. The crossroads of the B1397 (Dowsby to Boston road) and the A152 (Donington to Surfleet road) are located here. The Peterborough to Lincoln railway line crosses the B1397, at a level crossing in Risegate, and passes through the hamlet of Westhorpe further north. When this line was known as the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway, it had a railway station. The parish church of Gosberton is dedicated to St Peter and St Paul, and is under the Diocese of Lincoln. Gosberton Clough's wooden church is dedicated to St Gilbert and St Hugh. These two churches and that at Quadring are in the same Group, based in Gosberton. The Baptist Church in Gosberton was founded in 1666. At the time, non-conformist Christians had no protection from the law and, like John Bunyan, could be imprisoned for their faith. Worship takes place in the original 17th-century meeting house. The main occupation in the parish is farming. Some residents commute to jobs in surrounding areas and the larger towns of Spalding and Boston. Gosberton House Academy is a private school for children with learning difficulties. Public houses within the parish are The Black Horse Inn, The Duke of York and The Five Bells Inn in Risegate, and the Bell Inn in Gosberton village.

The quantity of analyte extracted by the fibre is proportional to its concentration in the sample as long as equilibrium is reached or, in case of short time pre-equilibrium, with help of convection or agitation. Analysis After extraction, the SPME fiber is transferred to the injection port of separating instruments, such as a gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, where desorption of the analyte takes place and analysis is carried out. Advantages The attraction of SPME is that the extraction is fast, simple, can be done usually without solvents, and detection limits can reach parts per trillion (ppt) levels for certain compounds. SPME also has great potential for field applications; on-site sampling can be done even by nonscientists without the need to have gas chromatography-mass spectrometry equipment at each location. When properly stored, samples can be analyzed days later in the laboratory without significant loss of volatiles.  Fiber Coatings  The coating on the SPME fiber can be selected to improve sensitivity for specific analytes of interest; ideally the sorbent layer will have a high affinity for the target analytes. There are many commercially available SPME fiber coatings that are combinations of polydimethylsiloxane, divinylbenzene, Carboxen, polyacrylate, and polyethylene glycol. However, one downside to many of the commercially available SPME fibers is that they tend to be physically, brittle due to their composition. Depending on the characteristics of the target analytes, certain properties of the coating improve extraction such as polarity, thickness, and surface area. The sample matrix can also influence the fiber coating selection. Based on the sample and analytes of interest, the fiber may need to tolerate direct immersion as opposed to a headspace extraction.

Artillery games have been described as a type of \\"shooting game\\", though they are more often classified as a type of strategy video game. Early precursors to the modern artillery-type games were text-only games that simulated artillery entirely with input data values.

And, finally, to a cross-platform subset of Microsoft BASIC by Creative Computing in 1979 for the book More BASIC Computer Games where it appears with multiple names: Artillery-3, Artillery 3, and WAR3. Another early game is Gunner (1973) by Tom Kloos. These early versions of turn-based tank combat games interpreted human-entered data such as the distance between the tanks, the velocity or \\"power\\" of the shot fired and the angle of the tanks' turrets. Emergence of graphical artillery The Tektronix 4051 BASIC language desktop computer of the mid-1970s had a demo program called Artillery which used a storage-CRT for graphics. A similar program appeared on the HP 2647 graphics terminal demo tape in the late 1970s. Artillery Simulator for the Apple II was among the earliest graphical versions of the turn-based artillery video game. Graphical adaptions of the artillery game, such as Super Artillery and Artillery Simulator, emerged on the Apple II computer platform in 1980. These games built upon the earlier concepts of the artillery games published in Creative Computing but allowed the players to also see a simple graphical representation of the tanks, battlefield, and terrain. The Apple II games also took wind speed into account when calculating the path of the artillery. Some games used lines on the screen to show trajectories previous shots had taken, allowing players to use visual data when considering their next shot. Similar games were made for home computers such as the Commodore PET by 1981. In 1983, Amoeba Software published a game called Tank Trax, which was very soon picked up and re-released by the early Mastertronic Games Company. This was again the classic version of the Artillery Game, however you could change the height of the hill in between the players to either a mountain or a foothill (However this sometimes made no difference in the actual gameplay as some foothills were as high as mountains and some mountains were low enough to be considered foothills). The players also had the default names of General Patton and Monty. Video game console variants of the artillery game soon emerged after the first graphical home computer versions. A two-player game called Smithereens! was released in 1982 for the Magnavox Odyssey¬≤ console in which two catapults, each behind a castle fortress wall, launched rocks at each other. Although not turn-based, the game made use of the console's speech synthesis to emit sarcastic insults when one player fired at the other. The first widespread artillery-based video game was Artillery Duel. Artillery Duel was originally written for the Bally Astrocade by Perkins Engineering and published by Bally in 1982. It was later released in 1983 for the Atari 2600 and ColecoVision video game consoles as well as the Commodore 64 and VIC-20 home computer platforms. The game featured more elaborate background and terrain graphics as well as a simple graphical readout of wind speed and amount of munitions. Around 1984 a game called Siege also appeared by publisher Melbourne House, this was released on many old computer systems such as the Commodore 16 (the game was bundled with C16's on a compilation tape along with Zapp, Hangman and many other games), VIC20 and several other comparable machines of that era, some variants for some reason were misspelled as instead of Siege. Artillery games for IBM PC compatibles Scorched Earth increased the popularity of the artillery game with its wide variety of weapons, numerous multi-player options, and flexible configuration options. With the increased presence of IBM-compatible PCs came the arrival of artillery games to the platform. In 1988, Artillery Combat, or EGAbomb, was released by Rad Delaroderie, written in Turbo BASIC, and was later distributed by RAD Software.(http://cd.textfiles.com/gameempire2/POWERS/BBM0059/RADCAT.TXT) Following in 1990, Kenny Morse released Tank Wars, which introduced the concept of buying weapons and multiple AI computer-player tanks to the artillery game. Gravity Wars was a conversion of the Amiga game of the same name that took the artillery game into space, introducing a 2D gravity field around planets, a format that has also inspired multiple re-makes. In 1991, one artillery style game in particular got widespread attention when Gorillas was distributed as part of QBasic with MS-DOS 5.0, the Amiga also had a release at this time called Amiga Tanx distributed via Amiga Format magazine in the UK which included some digitized voices of the tank commanders, some quite amusing when shots got too close for comfort. That year also saw the release of the first version of Scorched Earth by Wendell Hicken. Scorched Earth was a popular shareware game for MS-DOS in which tanks do turn-based battle in two-dimensional terrain, with each player adjusting the angle and power of his or her tank turret before each shot. Scorched Earth, with numerous weapon types and power-ups, is considered the modern archetype of its format, on which the popular games Worms, Atomic Cannon, Hogs of War, SpaceTanks, GunBound and Pocket Tanks are based. Scorched Earth incorporates many of the features of previous graphical artillery games (including sarcastic comments by each player's tank before firing) while expanding the options available to each player in regard to the choice of weapons available, the ability to use shields, parachutes, and ability to move the player's tank (with the purchase of fuel tanks). The game is highly configurable and utilizes a simple mouse-driven graphical user interface. Modern derivatives of the artillery game * In 1994, Team17 released the first version of its successful Worms series of turn-based games on the Amiga computer platform. In Worms, players control a small platoon of worms (rather than tanks) across a deformable landscape, battling other computer- or player-controlled teams. The games feature bright and humorous cartoon-style animation and a varied arsenal of bizarre weapons. Subsequent games in the series have been released since 1995, including a 3D variant (Worms 3D) in 2003. This was later followed by Worms Forts and Worms 4. The game then went back to its 2D style gameplay in Worms Open WarfareIGN - Worms Retrospective by James LaFlame (2006) and Worms:Reloaded (2010). * In 2000, Infogrames released Hogs of War, featuring 3D graphics, and a third-person perspective. The game is set in the First World War-era where anthropomorphic pigs engage in combat. Scorched 3D is a 3D polygonal artillery game. * In 2001, Gavin Camp released a 3D artillery game called Scorched 3D that is loosely based on the earlier game Scorched Earth. Scorched 3D offers options such as multiplayer LAN and Internet play, player avatars and flexible camera views. * In 2003, Isotope244 released Atomic Cannon for Windows, Mac OS X, and Windows Mobile. * Other active projects include Warmux or Hedgewars, fully playable on many systems, including Windows, Linux or Mac OS X. * DDTank is a popular browser-based free-to-play MMORPG artillery game. * In December 2009, Finland-based Rovio Mobile released Angry Birds, a popular video game in which the player aims to find the most efficient way to destroy various structures by anticipating the trajectory and destructive effects of a bird fired from slingshot, which could be considered a version of an artillery game as it features a 2D limited world, angle/power input, passive missiles which follow gravity-driven trajectories, and the use of missile and/or landscape destruction to kill several non-vocal pigs in each level. It does, however, lack counterfire from the player's targets, as well as infinite ammo of at least one variety of projectile. * The March 2012 release of Total War: Shogun 2: Fall of the Samurai saw the inclusion of an in game variant of the artillery game. Players may manually control artillery pieces, firing, and subsequently adjusting, for each round. *In March 2015, kChamp Games released their ShellShock Live game on Windows, a 2D artillery game inspired by the 1991 Scorched Earth built with Unity game engine. Players with their tanks, shoot enemies after maneuvering the trajectory by controlling the shot angle and power.

This region was known for its prosperity during the famed Vijayanagara Empire. History The history of the region dates back to the Mauryas. Inscriptions of king Ashoka are found in the Nittur village of the taluk. The region was subsequently ruled by many famous dynasties like Chalukyas, Vijayanagara Empire, Sultans of Bahamani, Nizams of Hyderabad. As a taluk headquarter During the British rule, the region around Siruguppa was made a taluk on 1 October 1910 after merging 46 villages from Bellary taluk, 29 from Adoni taluk and 23 from Alur taluk. However Siruguppa taluk was abolished on 1 April 1923. Once again, on 15 April 1929, 33 villages from Adoni taluk, 7 villages from Alur taluk along with the villages included in the Siruguppa Deputy Tahsildar‚Äôs division of Bellary taluk were constituted into a new taluk with Siruguppa as its Headquarters. Geography and climate Siruguppa is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Siruguppa Located on the Deccan plateau, it has an average elevation of 373 metres (1223 feet). It belongs to the dry inland region of Karnataka with an annual rainfall of 645 mm. The Taluk is bounded in the south by Bellary taluk, in the west by Hospet taluk, in the north by Sindhanur taluk of Raichur district and in the east by Adoni taluk of Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh. Town architecture Historically, Siruguppa town was not a great commercial centre, despite being made a taluk headquarter during the British era. Even after independence, the town did not undergo much expansion. But, it is a major exporter of rice from Karnataka. The map of Siruguppa is bitter-gourd shaped, with much of the town spread heavily on either side of NH-150A (Jevargi-Chamarajanagar). Most of the new extension areas are also developed alongside Bellary road, making the town look longer and narrower. Demographics India census, Siruguppa had a population of 66,503. Males constitute 51% of the population and females 49%. Siruguppa has an average literacy rate of 51%, lower than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 60%, and female literacy is 43%. In Siruguppa, 15% of the population is under 6 years of age. River River Tungabhadra embraces the town from north-west. It is the main link between North and South Karnataka. Important sight seeing places along the river bank are Vasudhendra teertha vrindavana in Kenchanagudda, Shambhulingeshwara temple along Desnur road & Haragol ghat. The agriculture of the entire taluk is benefited by the river through irrigation. Vedavathi River joins Tungabhadra at Kududarhal village. Transportation Siruguppa lies along NH-150A, which is the longest national highway in the state, connecting Bidar to Chamrajanagar. The town is facilitated by the buses run by the North Eastern Karnataka Road Transport Corporation NEKRTC, a subdivision of the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation KSRTC for the Hyderabad-Karnataka HK region. Siruguppa town is well connected by buses from Ballari, Adoni, Mantralayam, Tumkur, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Mysuru, Shivamogga, Hiriyuru,Dharmastala, Anantapur, Raichur, vijayapura, Bidar, Yadagiri and kalaburgi. It has its own bus depot and private bus facilities are also available from Siruguppa to Bengalooru,Mysuru,Mangaluru and Hyderabad. Siruguppa does not have a railway station. The nearest station to the town is Adoni in Andhra Pradesh. The nearby stations are listed below. * Adoni - 40 km * Ballary - 55 km * Raichur - 90 km Though the river Tungabhadra flows near the town, it is not used for transportation because of the shallowness of the river and inconsistent water levels. But a reconnaissance engineering-cum-traffic survey for a new railway line between Ballari and Lingasugur via Siruguppa, Sindhanur (145 km) and Ballari-Gabbur line Via Siruguppa,Devadurga survey has been completed and the report is under preparation. Education Siruguppa belongs to the Hyderabad- Karnataka region, a relatively backward zone of the Karnataka state. The town was educationally lagging behind in the past. Till recently, it did not even have a degree college for science. But the town has made rapid progress in education in the last decade. It boasts of a degree college for science, more than 3 for arts and commerce and around half a dozen pre-university colleges. The town also has up to 20 schools with one of them offering ICSE curriculum. The educational institutions of Siruguppa have produced a few IAS bureaucrats and many doctors, engineers, artists and other professionals. Industries Siruguppa has the largest number of rice industries in Karnataka - more than 100. The trio of Siruguppa, Sindhanoor and Gangavati form one of the largest producers of rice in Karnataka. That is why Siruguppa is often called \\"Land of Paddy\\". There are vast fields of paddy and sugarcane. A sugar factory is located in Deshnur village which is 5 km away from town and a steel factory is located in Honnarahalli. Recently, this factory has stopped. There are also 60 oil factories around Siruguppa.

History The Buddhist presence in Italy begins to be known in the 1960s, with the first attempts to ground some Buddhist centers. Between the oldest we can count the one of Engaku Taino and the Fudenji of Taiten Guareschi, disciple of Taisen Deshimaru. In 1960 is founded the Buddhist Italian Association (Associazione Buddhista Italiana) and in 1967 begins the publishing of the review Buddhismo Scientifico. From the years 1984-1989, the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition of Thubten Yeshe and Thubten Zopa Rinpoche was based at the Istituto Lama Tzong Khapa in the Tuscan village of Pomaia. The Italian Buddhist Union, member of the European Buddhist Union,Unione Buddhista Italiana at European Buddhist Union was founded in Milan in 1985, received recognition by the President of the Italian Republic in 1991 and signed an agreement with the Italian government in 2007, in accordance with article 8 of the Italian Constitution (which regulates the relations with religious minorities), and the agreement became law in 2012.http://presidenza.governo.it/USRI/confessioni/intese_indice.htmlhttp://www.normattiva.it/uri- res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:legge:2012;245 The UBI is acknowledged as an association with juridical figure and coordinates the 44 principal centers in Italy in the tradition Theravada, Mahayana, Vajrayana which hold the practice and the sharing of the traditional teaching. Between the most important Buddhist centers of Italy we can note the Soto Zen center \\"L'Arco\\", in Rome, the already citated Scaramuccia of Engaku Taino, in Orvieto; even in Rome, the lay association laica A.Me.Co for the practice of Theravada buddhism, founded and directed by the lay dharma teacher Corrado Pensa, and near to the theravada monastery of the Forest's Sangha; In Milan, the biggest zen center is the zen monastery Ensoji il Cerchio, founded and guided by the zen master Testugen Serra; in Pomaia, the Tibetan Buddhism finds one of the biggest center in Europe, the Lama Tzong Khapa Institute. The Vajrayana Buddhism is represented, among others, by the centers of the Diamond Way Buddhism of the Kagyu school, spread in almost all the Italian regions. Even the Japanese Buddhist school founded by Nichiren Daishonin sees in the UBI his representance: the temple of the Nichiren Shu Renkoji, in Cereseto, near Novara, guided by the master Shoryo Tarabini, and the association Nipponzan Myohonji, which provided to the grounding of the biggest stupa in Italy, the Peace Pagoda in Comiso (Sicily). In 2014 also Honmon Butsury≈´-sh≈´, or HBS, with its Kofuji temple in Florence, has become part of UBI. In June 2015, the SGI-Italy (Soka Gakkai Italian Buddhist Institute) was recognized by the Italian government with a special accord under Italian Constitution Article 8, acknowledging it as an official religion of Italy and eligible to receive direct taxpayer funding for its religious and social activities. It also recognizes the Soka Gakkai as a \\"Concordat\\" (It: \\"Intesa\\") that grants the religions status in \\"a special 'club' of denominations consulted by the government in certain occasions, allowed to appoint chaplains in the army - a concordat is not needed for appointing chaplains in hospitals and jails - and, perhaps more importantly, to be partially financed by taxpayers' money.\\" Eleven other religious denominations share this status.

RƒÅtƒÅ sets out to avenge the murder, travelling to the home of Matuku, where a servant of the ogre tells him that Matuku comes out to devour people each new moon, and that he can be killed at the pool where he washes his face and hair. RƒÅtƒÅ waits till the ogre comes out and is leaning over with his head in the pool. He grabs him by the hair and kills him. Matuku's bones are used to make spears for hunting birds. RƒÅtƒÅ searches for his father's bones so that he can afford them the proper respect. He learns that the Ponaturi have the bones in their village. He must build a canoe to get there. He goes into the forest, and fells a tree, and cuts off the top. His day's work over, he goes home, and returns the next morning. To his surprise he finds the tree standing upright and whole. Once again he cuts it down, but when he returns he finds the tree standing again. He hides in the forest, and hears the voices of the multitude of the hƒÅkuturi (forest spirits, called rorotini in one account), who set to work to re-erect the tree, putting each chip into its proper place. He runs out and catches some of the hakuturi, who tell him they re-erected the tree because he insulted TƒÅne, the god of the forest, by not performing the correct rituals before felling the tree. RƒÅtƒÅ is ashamed, and expresses regret. Then the hƒÅkuturi make him a canoe, naming it Niwaru (alias Niwareka, ƒÄniwaniwa, etc.)(Biggs 1966:450). RƒÅtƒÅ and his people launch the canoe and paddle off to find the Ponaturi. Arriving, RƒÅtƒÅ cleverly surrounds them, kills their priests, and rescues his father's bones. The Ponaturi regroup and give chase. The battle goes badly until RƒÅtƒÅ recites an incantation called Titikura that he overheard their priests recite while they were tapping together the bones of Wahieroa. In a flash all RƒÅtƒÅ's dead warriors return to life and attack and slaughter all of the Ponaturi. RƒÅtƒÅ is the father of T≈´whakararo, who is the father of Whakatau.

Talmidei Chachamim; in Mishnaic Hebrew Talmidh ·∏§akham and Talmidhe ·∏§akhamim) is an honorific title given to one well versed in Jewish law, in effect, a Torah scholar. Expectations of a Talmid Chacham A Talmid Chacham is expected to uphold his rank and not to compromise his dignity. As in the case of a king, he is not permitted to allow anyone to omit the performance of any public act of reverence due to him, to the effect that the Talmid Chacham acts as a facilitator, because in him the Halakha is honored or slighted. A Talmid Chacham must avoid six acts: to go abroad in perfumed garments; to walk alone at night; to wear shabby shoes; to converse with a woman while on the street (even if she is his wife); to sit in the society of an ignoramus; to be the last to enter the beth midrash.Talmud, Berachot 43b With regard to association with an ignoramus, the Talmud says: \\"The Talmid Chacham is first likened by the ignoramus to a vase of gold; if he converses with him, he is looked upon as a vase of silver; and if he accepts a service from him, he is regarded as a vase of earth.\\"Sanhedrin) Among the privileges of the Talmid Chacham is the right of declining to present himself as a witness in suits concerning money transactions before a judge who is his inferior in knowledge.Shulchan Aruch Hoshen Mishpat 28 The Talmid Chacham was expected to be familiar with all branches of Torah study, and even all branches of general human learning. \\"He who understands astronomy,\\" says Rabbi Yochanan, \\"and does not pursue the study of it, of that man it is written: 'But they regard not the work of the Lord, neither consider the operation of His hands'\\" (Isaiah). Rabbi Yochanan also says that only someone able to answer all Halakhic questions, even those which deal only with the insignificant treatise Kallah, is a Talmid Chacham worthy to be appointed leader of a community.Shabbat 114a In accordance with this view, some later rabbinical authorities assert that in modern times no one deserves to be called by this epithet.Knesset Hagedolah on Yoreh Deah 18 The principles with which the Talmid Chacham must live are enumerated in the first chapter of the work Derekh Eretz Zutta, opening with the following sentence: \\"The way of the wise is to be modest, humble, alert, and intelligent; to endure injustice; to make himself beloved of men; to be gracious in his interactions even with subordinates; to avoid wrong-doing; to judge each man according to his deeds; to act according to the motto 'I take no pleasure in the good things of this world, seeing that life here below is not my portion.' Wrapped in his mantle, he sits at the feet of the wise; no one can detect anything unseemly in him; he puts relevant questions, and gives suitable answers.\\" Attitudes toward the Talmid Chacham Prizing Torah knowledge above all worldly goods, Talmidei Chachamim in Jewish society were afforded many privileges and prerogatives as well as duties. In the Middle Ages the Talmid Chacham was consulted by the Jewish community not only in spiritual matters, but also in worldly affairs. Even when he held no official position in the community, he supervised religious activities, determined the time and form of prayers, verified weights and measures, etc. To enable him to devote himself entirely to study, Jewish legislation exempted him from the payment of taxes and from performing any specific mundane duties.Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 243 Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel is quoted as having said \\"[Every] person should always conduct himself as a talmid chacham\\".Pesachim 54b References * Category:Hebrew words and phrases Category:Orthodox rabbinic roles and titles ","title":"Talmid Chacham"},{"id":"5809975","text":"Caribou Mountains are a mountain range in the Rocky Mountains in Idaho, United States.

It consists of a runway and served 14,485 passengers in 2016. A further 14,663 landed and started at the airport without leaving the aircraft.STATISTICS Scheduled services are provided by Wider√∏e using the Dash 8 to Kirkenes, Hammerfest and other communities in Finnmark. The airport is owned and operated by the state-owned Avinor. It is the second airport in B√•tsfjord. The first was built in 1973, but only had a gravel runway. When Wider√∏e replaced their smaller de Havilland Canada Twin Otters (19-20 seats) with the Dash 8 (39 seats), a new airport was needed to serve B√•tsfjord. The new airport cost 178 million Norwegian krone and opened on 9 September 1999. History : The first airline to operate to B√•tsfjord was Varangfly, later renamed Norving, who flew seaplane taxi and ambulance flights in the early 1960s.Melling: 39 Construction of an airfield in B√•tsfjorddalen was started by the aviation club B√•tsfjord Flyklubb in 1972 and completed in May 1973. It consisted of an gravel runway and was served with regular flights by Norving. The municipality took over ownership of the airport in 1976.Melling: 101 Norving remained the sole operator until 1990, when the routes were taken over by Wider√∏e using the Twin Otter. Departures hall with the winged-shaped curve of the roof visible The Ministry of Transport and Communications announced in February 1993 that they were considering taking over ownership and operations of the airport through the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA, later renamed Avinor). In December, Wider√∏e articulated that B√•tsfjord Airport did not meet the demands for future operation as it lacked proper navigational aids and an asphalt runway. Wider√∏e stated that with the introduction of the Dash 8, which would be phased in between 1993 and 1995, they would no longer be able to serve the airport. The CAA stated, instead, that the new airport should be built, estimated to cost between 70 and 80 million Norwegian krone (NOK). The main reason was that the former airport was poorly located in relation to the terrain, being located in a valley. In April 1994 the ministry stated that they were considering closing many of the smallest regional airports, including B√•tsfjord. In April 1995, when Parliament decided to nationalize twenty-six regional airports owned by their respective municipalities, they also debated a proposal to build a new airport in B√•tsfjord. At the time Wider√∏e was obliged to operate routes to the airport until 31 March 1997. In December 1995, Wider√∏e took delivery of their fifteenth Dash 8 and thus their only need for a Twin Otter was to serve B√•tsfjord. From 1994 to 1997, the cost estimates for the new airport increased from NOK 95 to 125 million. By June 1998, Parliament approved additional funding which brought the cost to NOK 178 million, including a new county road for NOK 8 million. The airport opened on 9 September 1999. From the opening Wider√∏e used the Twin Otter until 1 April 2000, when the route was taken over by larger Dash 8 aircraft. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. Avinor sees a problem in getting new aircraft of the size of the Dash 8-100 which can use the 800 meter runways, so they plan to use smaller planes with 19 seats for these small airports when the Dash 8-100 retire before 2030. Facilities Airport air side The terminal consists of a single building, with an integrated control tower, capable of handling 120 passengers per hour. The facade is covered in Russian larch; the focus on wood as a dominant material was common for Norwegian architecture the 1990s, and is also seen at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen (opened in 1998) and for the venues of the 1994 Winter Olympics. The terminal was designed by Alta-based architect Solveig Thorsen and is shaped like an aircraft wing, similar to the terminal building at Gardermoen. There is a single gate at the airport, which prior to the installation of security control was 17 steps from the entrance. The airport resides at an elevation of above mean sea level. The runway is designated 03‚Äì21, with an asphalt surface measuring . SCAT-I, a Global Positioning System-based landing system, is under deployment. It is possible to extend the runway to if desirable in the future. The tarmac has space for three simultaneous aircraft. The airport is located ten minutes' drive (7 km/4 mi) from the town center. There are taxis, paid parking and car rental available, but no bus service.  Airlines and destinations  All services from the airport are operated by Wider√∏e with 39-seat Dash-8-100 aircraft. All routes, though not necessarily direct, fly to either Kirkenes Airport, H√∏ybuktmoen, Hammerfest Airport or Troms√∏ Airport. The routes from B√•tsfjord are operated on a public service obligation with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The airport served 12,363 passengers, 2,494 aircraft movements and handled 3 tons of cargo in 2012. The airport operated with a deficit of NOK 20 million in 2012.

The surname died out in England, but is common in Ireland, where it was imported at the time of the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 12th century. While not a particularly common name, Cusack is historically associated with a number of variant forms, such as de Cussac, de Cusack, de Ciusak, de C√≠os√≥g, de C√≠omhs√≠g, Mac √ços√≥g, and Mac Isog. Irish emigrants to the Americas were reportedly given alternative spellings by immigration officers, based on their pronunciation, however this appears to be a myth. The following: Cusack, Kuzak, Kuzack, Cusick, and Cussack are modern variants. Origin Geoffrey de Cusack arrived in Ireland during the reign of King John, possibly at the invitation of his relative, Adam de Feypo. The family served as Lords of Killeen (ranked below a Baron and requiring Knight Scutage i.e. the supply of knights for 40 days service per year to Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath, when requested). History Cusack family connections start from when Geoffrey de Cusack arrived from CUSSAC, north west of Bordeaux, in the Duchy of Aquitaine, France in 1172. Geoffrey built his castle at Killeen (Co. Meath) in 1181. Included are references to the estates acquired by some of his descendants as well as descriptions of the family Crest and Motto also the Memorial Stones and the fine Epitaph to Sir Thomas Cusack and the last of the Cusacks at Killeen‚ÄîLady Joan de Cusack. The de Cussac Royal French connection can be studied in the Generlogiques et Historique de la Noblesse de France and also in Genealogie de la Maison de Cusack. The de Cussac family originally held land and influence over present day Cussac-Fort-Medoc (45.07N, 0.43W) in France, north of Bordeaux in what was then the Duchy of Aquitaine. Geoffrey de Cusack's arrival in Ireland was not long after the first Normans had landed in 1169. Geoffrey was granted the manor of Killeen, , by Adam de Feypo, a relative who obtained his lands by charter (see The Song of (King) Dermot and the Earl (Strongbow)), and like Adam he was subject to Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath. Requiring, when called for, the supply of 20 knights, these received 2 marks per day for their 40 day service. He married Matilda le Petit, sister of William le Petit who held a Barony at Mullingar and a castle at Donboyne (ORPED, ii, p. 120), sometime before 1181CF.Gallwey. p. 301. and bore him at least two sons, Adam and William (English Public Records) however Irish Languish Pedigrees believe his eldest son was Geoffrey II. Geoffrey de Cusack died between 1210 and 1218 he is the first of long lines of Cusacks in Ireland. Both the medieval and modern Cusack lines and genealogy of Geoffrey's offspring have been traced in great detail by Lt. Colonel Hubert Gallwey. In 1399 the manors and estates of the Lordship of Killeen passed by the marriage of Lady Joan de Cusack to Christopher Plunkett of Rathragen. Cusack acquisitions In the intervening 220 years, between 1172 and 1399, there was sporadic hiving off from the parent stock (to various offspring), dividing up of land and the acquisition of new estates. The descendants of Geoffrey de Cusack acquired many manors/townships‚ÄîGerrardstown, Ballymolgan, Lismullen, Troubly, Clonard, Clonmahon and Tullahard for example. John de Cusack before 1300 obtained the manor of Dromin, Ardee Barony, Co Louth. Walter de Cusack in 1333, by marriage, Millistown and the castle at Knocktopher in Kilkenny. John de Cusack in 1352 obtained Belper in Killeen parish. John III de Cusack before 1377 obtained Cushinstown. Symon de Cusack circa 1398 obtained Marinerstown. Plunder and ransom There were many attacks on the Norman invaders by Irish Kings and their armies so Geoffrey and his companions saw regular service. The practice of raiding the fiefdoms of others was rife and we are fortunate to have a record of Geoffrey de Cusack doing just this. > 1177 was the year de Cusack saw Connaught for the first time however the > raid across the Shannon back-fired, and Geoffrey and his friends returned > ruefully rubbing their bruises. If plunder is an index of success, 1178 > could be counted a good year for they plundered Clonmacnoise. (AFM; cf, > Curtis, HMI, p. 80; Orpen, ii, p. 92) This was an era of chivalry, at least for the knights who fought. You might be defeated, wounded and captured but not killed. A knight was worth more alive, for ransom, than dead. The Cusacks did not escape this ignominy. > Geoffrey II and his brother William revolted against King John and were > defeated, along with de Lacy, at Carrickfergus Castle in 1210. The record > shows that Geoffrey II, had set against him \\"100 marks for his liberation\\" > and the Justiciar was enjoined \\"to take no nonsense and to see to it that de > Cusack promises his faithful service (to King John) before his discharge\\". > (CDI, i, n.529) De Cusack would have been pleased when five years later John de Lacy, a relative, was appointed one of the 25 Barons to oversee the Magna Carta which King John was forced to agree to on 15 June 1215. Note a \\"mark\\" is described as being equal to 8 oz of silver (ransoms ranged from 10 to 1000 marks). It is evident that the Cusacks interests, by the third generation, had become Irish rather than English, also that these men could speak little or no French and had become Anglo-Irish rather than Anglo-Norman. Occupational summary Fr. Pearse Cusack, O. Cist in his research publication The Cusacks of Killeen, Co Meath sums up the Cusack dynasty as follows: Killeen Castle Killeen Castle Killeen Castle Geoffrey de Cusack Lord of Killeen having occupied his lands in 1172 he built his castle. Over the doorway of Killeen Castle (see Killeen Castle Co.Meath) the date of the building is given as 1181.Annals of St Mary's CSM.ii, p. 275. An early description of Killeen Castle reads- The date is 1 August‚Äîthe feast of St. Peter's Chains‚ÄîAs we approach the castle we are faced by four tall battlemented towers with five storeys of slit openings linking the curtain walls of the building. The castle is set on a slight mound. We enter by a steep wooden stairway, and find ourselves, having passed through the considerable thickness of the wall from the narrow doorway, in the Great Hall on the first floor. Rushes cover the stone flags, and besides the usual furniture, such as a trestle-table, benches and the straight-backed, carved, oaken armchair of the Lord of the Manor, we note on our left a heavy green and white curtain covering one wall of the Hall. Opposite us with its sloping hood is the fireplave with logs burning in the grate. The right hand wall is hung with the Lord's war harness, his morion (helmet), hunting trophies and a feathered lure used in falconry. There is a costly piece with a perch and gilt borders. On top of an oaken chest is the Lord's great seal and some other pieces of plain silver. Opening off the Great Hall are spiral staircases leading to mezzanine rooms in the towers, bedrooms, closets and gardrobrs, and also a chapel. In the Much (i.e. Great) Chamber over the Great Hall is the large bed of my Lord and Lady with its long red costereys. A much later description reads: > The present picturesque turreted pile retains two of the original square > 12th-century towers to the north of the building. The castle was built on a > mound and the porch, an addition, masks the mound. However, on entering one > has to climb a staircase to reach the entrance hall proper at the ground > level of the original castle. NOTE The two square towers on the right of the picture are original. Llanthony In 1100 a nobleman came across a ruined chapel in a remote Welsh valley and decided to devote himself to solitary prayer and study. Others joined him and a community was established. Eighty five years later Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath, great-grandson of the original nobleman‚ÄîWilliam de Lacy, endowed the community. Adam de Feypo had been a de Lacy knight and was in turn a relative of Geoffrey de Cusack who in turn was also subject to the Lord of Meath. Hence Geoffrey's gifts to Llanthony. Large gifts to religious communities were recorded by Charter and these were sent to Rome. The Pope subsequently confirmed them by Papal Letter. Geoffrey was well established at Killeen Castle as can be seen by the letters of 1185 and 15 Nov 1188CSM, i, pp. 157‚Äì159. from Pope Clement III (CSM, i, p. 157‚Äì159) confirming the grant of Geoffrey de Cusack's gift to Llanthony Priory in Wales.IR.CARTUL.Llanthony.77. (IR.CARTUL.Llanthony.77). There were subsequent grants and gifts to Llanthony Seconda in Gloucester. A later Charter states- Biltini Manor The afore mentioned gift of 13 acres to Llanthony is a good introduction to Biltini (today Balreagh) and its relevance today. The manor was thirty miles west of Killeen. The exact date of the acquisition Charter is not known however it was witnessed by Roger, son of Geoffrey and Matilda, and Adam de Feypo, before his death in 1190/91 (ref. IR Cartul, llanthony 239‚Äì40). The castle Geoffrey built here on the motte-and-bailey was part of a Norman administrative chain and was described as being the \\"most spectacular\\". > The motte, he threw up, commands a view streatching to an almost circular > horizon. A scatter of stones and traces of fortifications at the base of the > mound testify that a stone castle was built here. (- Geoffrey's castle is > still, after 800 years, in use. The motte, built on the highest point of the > 400ft contour line, is being used today by the Ordinance Surveyors as a > triangulation point.) Just west of Balreach the townland is still called \\"Geoffreystown\\" this, including the Charters also the presence of the motte and ruined church, is confirmation that Geoffrey de Cusack held Biltini Manor. Dunsany right The Down Survey of the Barony of Skryne dated 1657 (original in the Biblioth√®que nationale, Paris) shows as part of it the attached map. As can be seen Killeen is recorded as a 'parish' whereas Dunsany is not. \\"In the 12th century, townlands were grouped together to form units called parishes, each parish supported a church or chapel. The system was not a system native to Ireland\\", this seems to have only applied to Norman held lands.Index of Parishes and Townlands of Ireland from 17th Century Maps by Y.M. Goblet. The inclusion of Dunsany's in the Cusack fiefdom appears to have been in 1305CAR.DOC.Irl. 1302-7 p. 255. (CAR.DOC.Irl.1302-7 p. 255) as it does not appear before this in any of the 12th- and 13th-century charters. This could have been because: \\"the intusive wedge of Dunsany was occupied by an Irish chieftain and his retainers, who remained ensconced there wedded to their Celtic way of life, while Norman 'improvements' were imposed all round them\\". It is therefore unlikely for there to have been a \\"Norman\\" fortification/castle in Dunsany before 1305. Crest Cusack Crest \\"Above the Handcock escutcheon (Stone No.3) is carved the Cusack Crest‚Äîa mermaid holding a sword in her right hand and a comb in her left hand. During the absence of Deputy St. Leger, Sir Thomas held the Sword of State. It is said, in the family papers, that this accounts for the sword held by the mermaid.\\" The Cusack CREST is recorded and described in The Genealogical and Historic Archives of the NOBILITY OF FRANCE as Mermaid holding a sword in the right hand and a Sceptre Fleurdelyse in the left. Fairbairn's Book of Crests 1859 states (ref cf.184.7) 'CUSACK of Killeen, Gerrardstown, Lismullen and Clonard. Co Meath, Ireland. A mermaid sa., holding in the dexter hand a sword, and in the sinister a sceptre ppr. (today worn on a signet ring) Motto The Cusack MOTTO is shown as En Dieu est mon Espoir (In God is my Hope). The earliest 'hard examples in stone' of the Crest and Motto have been found on the memorial stones of Sir Thomas Cusack (1490-1571) at Trevet. Memorial stones Memorial stones were erected as a monument to Sir Thomas Cusack (1490‚Äì1571) who after entering the Inner Temple, London in 1522 was elected to the position of Master of the Revels in 1524 returned to Ireland as Second Justice of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland). Sir Thomas became Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland, held the office of Master of the Rolls in Ireland, Keeper of the Great Seal of Ireland and became Lord Chancellor of Ireland. The research into these stones are thanks to historian Elizabeth Hickey. Note that the stones would have originally been painted in vivid colours to bring out the three dimensional effect. Stone No.1 Stone No.1 Photograph Sketch of carving on the stone Octagonal in shape, approx 0.8m dia. - lies in front of Staffordstown House, Navan - shows the Cusack arms and above is carved \\"Sir Thomas Cusack Knight\\" and the date 1571 on the left hand side of the shield. The lettering on the stone does not show up in the photograph hence the sketch was made. Stone No.2 Sir Thomas, Wife and Children Measures 2.35 m √ó 0.75 m‚Äîmoved to Skryne Parish Church around 1945‚Äîshows Sir Thomas with his second wife and their 13 children. The family crest‚Äîa mermaid‚Äîis carved on the top right corner. Behind the kneeling Sir Thomas are his four sons while opposite behind Dame Maud are six of her daughters. The two girls standing are the remaining daughters, they carry the judge's mace and the Lord Chancellor's purse. The third figure is of a boy with a bowl in his left hand and a pipe in his right through which he is blowing bubbles towards the youngest kneeling child who seems to bend slightly away from his brother. The blowing of bubbles is taken to represent the transitoriness of human life. Under the table is carved a dog. Stone No.3 family tree with Mermaid and Motto Measures 1.2 m √ó 2.5 6m‚Äîlies in the ruined choir of Trevet Church. This stone is broken. On this is carved a family tree originating from a heraldic shield with the Cusack coat of arms on the dexter side. The laurel wreath still carries some of the Cusack motto En Dieu est mon Espoir. Furthermore, on the tree appears the Cusack Crest described as \\"The Mermaid holding a Sword in her right hand and what appears to be a comb in her left\\". The modern crest differs slightly. At the top of the stone there are three suns with the letters I.H.S. surmounted by a cross in each. It is a Franciscan device to show that devotion to Christ should supersede earthly loyalties. The reason for the three suns could have been in memory of the three Sir Thomas children who were dead when the stone was carved. Stone No.4 Sketch of the Epitaph Measures 2.15 m √ó 0.87 m‚Äîlies in the ruins of Trevet Church. This stone is broken. Carved on it is Sir Thomas's epitaph, which has been translated as follows, by the late Professor R. M. Gwynn of Trinity College, Dublin. On the bottom left can be seen the skeletal figure of Death with a long bow firing an arrow at the recumbent figure of Sir Thomas who holds an hour glass which shows that the sands of time have passed for him. The mermaid crest is shown in the top right.

There appears to be no definitive record of how their mother's inheritance (ref. Carew.MSS, V, p. 357) was shared between them. However what they and the Cusacks, down the years, do share is that Norman Knight ancestor who came to Ireland in 1172 - Geoffrey de Cusack.

Author In 1936 Millard published a biography of Adolphe Max, who had been mayor of Brussels during the First World War and had been imprisoned for refusing to cooperate with the occupying forces.Burgomaster Max, reviewed in Foreign Affairs, January 1937. He followed this in 1937 with a novel inspired by the clandestine wartime newspaper La Libre Belgique, entitled Uncensored.Howard Maxford, Hammer Complete: The Films, the Personnel, the Company (2019), p. 559. In 1942, this was adapted for the screen as Uncensored, with Terence Rattigan as the main scriptwriter. The setting was updated to the contemporary German occupation of Belgium during World War II. Screenwriter Hollywood success came after the war, when Millard collaborated on the screenplay for Come to the Stable, a comedy about nuns. He fared better the following year when he picked up an Academy Award nomination for the gritty war movie The Frogmen (1951). Millard's output after that was less successful though interesting: the James Stewart thriller No Highway in the Sky (1951) and Otto Preminger's full-guns- blazing femme fatale movie Angel Face (1952). Millard's reputation was considerably tarnished (as indeed was everyone involved in the project) with the deliriously bad John Wayne-Susan Hayward barbarian epic The Conqueror (1956), a film probably more famous now for filming in a nuclear bomb testing site and most of the cast and crew succumbing to early, cancer-related deaths. After that, Millard found consistent work on television, writing scripts for such shows as Wagon Train, The Alfred Hitchcock Hour for which his was awarded in 2013 by the Writers Guild of America (101 Best written TV Series) and Twelve O'Clock High.

Jenny debuted on-screen during the pilot episode and remained until the series' final episode. Jenny became well documented in the media for her outlandish plots. Jenny was created by series creator Ilene Chaiken, based on herself as a younger woman living in the lesbian community. Chaiken implemented a series of changes to the character, one of which being the inclusion of a sexual abuse storyline and self-harm, which some critics observed as being attempts to make her likable in the LGBT community. One storyline that gained mainstream attention was adopting a homeless dog, only to have it put down for personal gain. Other storylines include stripping, writing novels, coming out, directing a film, affairs, and her possible murder. The final season is based around the lead-up to her death, during which Jenny made herself extremely unpopular with her friends, who became suspects. Jenny's character was unpopular with both fans and critics throughout the entire series because of her frequent narcissistic tendencies, her prima donna ways, her egotistical attitude, irresponsibility, frequent self-pity and selfish persona. She has also been labeled a \\"love to hate\\" character. The majority of critics have been intrigued by her \\"polarising personality\\" and branded it as one of the main reasons to watch the series. New York magazine gave a large amount of praise to Jenny and on one occasion stated: \\"Jenny Schecter is The L Word, and the death of her is the death of the show.\\" Kirshner received critical praise for her portrayal of the character. Kirshner has stated she loved playing Jenny because she felt like a brand new character during each season. She has also stated that it is difficult for people to like the character as she can be \\"very despicable\\" and even the LGBT community does not like her because of her \\"duplicity and confusion\\". Character creation and casting Series creator Ilene Chaiken created Jennifer. She based her on her own past experiences of coming out and dealing with the everyday life in the lesbian community as a younger woman.Porter 2006, p.229. Like Jenny, Chaiken had befriended a group of lesbians who ran a cafe and had her first sexual encounter with a female. Actress Mia Kirshner was cast in the role. Chaiken admitted she had been searching for the right actress to play Jennifer \\"for a long time\\". Kirshner auditioned via video tape, Chaiken recalled that upon viewing it she thought Kirshner was \\"stunning\\". She thought Kirshner had \\"riveting beauty that is unlike anyone else's, and she was so deep and intense.\\" Kirshner would often express her concern that she was not challenged enough or not making Jennifer as \\"deep enough\\" as she could be. Chaiken said it was these qualities that made Kirshner \\"the bravest and boldest of actors\\" and branded her \\"utterly fearless\\" in her approach to Jenny. Character development Characterization Throughout her duration on the series, Jenny went on a journey from the very first episode, which portrayed her as a selfish egotist; many observers have perceived her as a narcissist, and even as a borderline sociopath. This latter assessment was based early on around her recurrent lying, and the fact she seems to excuse her own cheating in the first few seasons as a corollary of empowerment and as research for her book: which features an experimentalist female character who is evidently herself. Kirshner has described Jenny as mostly being duplicitous and confused. Jenny often acted \\"utterly impulsive\\". Kirshner said it is very hard for people in the series and the viewers to like Jenny because she is \\"a very despicable character who lies, cheats, behaves and treats other people horribly for no reason, and is extremely selfish, self-indulgent and so terribly truthful... and she does not hesitate to hide any it.\\" Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe described Jenny stating: \\"Dreary, confused, introverted narcissist [...] downcast, secretive, almost Goth in her black moodiness, she is the epitome of an unhappy egotist. She is so consumed with the ups and downs of her own depression and self-loathing, she just doesn't have the energy to look outward. Her misery is her mirror, and she's forever gazing into it.\\" New York Magazine describe Jenny as a capricious yet obnoxious type of character adding that she can be patronizing. They also observe her as looking \\"fabulous, fun, and sexy but her downfall is her annoying side.\\" Diane Shipley of The Guardian branded Jenny a \\"whiny egomaniac\\". Lesbian magazine Curve brands Jenny a \\"narcissistic navel-gazer\\". Sexuality When Jenny is introduced on-screen she arrives in Los Angeles to stay with her boyfriend Tim Haspel (Eric Mabius). Tim is described as the person who makes Jenny \\"feel the safest in the world\\".Bolonik 2005, p.18. She soon becomes aware her neighbors Tina Kennard (Laurel Holloman) and Bette Porter (Jennifer Beals) are lesbians. Kirshner said that Jenny becomes intrigued by lesbians and attends their party. Jenny meets Marina Ferrer (Karina Lombard), who senses that Jenny wants some danger in her life. When Marina kisses her, Jenny sees her life going into a tailspin and forces her to reckon with herself. Jenny acknowledges her passion for Marina, but realizes that being unfaithful will ruin \\"the one stable relationship she's ever had\\". However, they begin an affair. In the show's companion book \\"The L Word: Welcome to our planet\\", they describe Jenny's confusion as leaving her \\"unmoored\\". She was alone in battling the heartache, along with facing \\"an overwhelming identity crisis\\" in a place that was not yet her home. Kirshner opined that the situation with Jenny was \\"not pretty\\". Jenny loves two people at once, She is the kind of character \\"who will just grab experiences because of the holes inside her [...] she will leave the casualties in the wake behind her.\\" Kirshner often pushed and encouraged for more truth. She made Jenny's sex scenes \\"darker, painful, and sometimes not so pretty to watch\\". Kirshner did not mind portraying sex scenes with other females. She described them as \\"more fun and easier\\" and that she genuinely felt there was \\"nothing to be ashamed of.\\" For her there was a \\"comfort level that is beautiful\\". Kirshner had never appeared nude in previous roles, but she requested to go nude as Jenny in certain scenes to add to the reality. Chaiken decided to keep audiences guessing about Jenny's sexuality. She stated that whilst sexuality can be fluid, that Jenny's sexuality \\"definitely exists on the edge of fluidity\\". This was because she had planned to have Jenny romantically involved mostly with females, but with some males too. Sexual abuse One of Jenny's storylines in season two was her revelation of being sexually abused as a child. The events were portrayed in a series of flashbacks and dream sequences. Yet, this left viewers confused about what actually happened to Jenny. During an interview with LGBT monthly magazine The Advocate, Chaiken commented about the storyline: \\"Well we all know it was an incident of sexual abuse. I had not wanted to be more explicit about it than that ‚Äì one because memory of trauma is very strange. Who knows what happened to Jenny? Jenny doesn't necessarily know herself.\\" Chaiken also didn't want to portray Jenny's ordeal in an explicit manner, confirming this she said: \\"I am loath to portray rape as a filmmaker. I think it is really hard to do it without somehow becoming complicit and exploitative. And so as much as it's important to talk about it, I wanted to be vague and not milk it.\\" Chaiken has also admitted that the use of dream sequences involving Jenny were not a successful inclusion, but claimed it was necessary to portray Jenny coming to terms with her abuse. Heather Hogan of AfterEllen criticized the storyline because there was no conclusion to it, also stating it was never explored enough, leading everyone to think she was just a jerk. Transformation Jenny was negatively received amongst TV critics and viewers from the very first episode after she cheated on her nice guy boyfriend, Tim, with another woman for no clear reason. This prompted Chaiken to implement a series of changes to Jenny to help make her more likable. Chaiken defended Jenny stating: \\"I'm well aware of the response to Jenny. I love the character, and I love that people are passionate about her. I know there are a lot of people who just can't stand her. And that's why it's so important to have that character in the mix.\\" Kirshner defended Jenny stating: \\"Jenny's a very controversial character. I think the great thing about her is the fact that she's so flawed.\\" During season two Jenny is seen coming out, getting her hair cut and becoming best friends with Shane McCutcheon (Katherine Moennig). AfterEllen.com stated that Jenny cutting off her hair was a defining moment in her development because it also symbolized her cutting all of the bad stuff that happened before out of her life. Jenny's transition continued into season three, Chaiken stated: \\"We find Jenny coming together, I predict this [...] that Jenny will be more likable and accessible to the audience than she has ever been. She's recovering.\\" In 2009, Chaiken was still confused over Jenny's bad reception, of why it might be she said: \\"People read into the character that she was a manipulator, self-absorbed, and a trouble maker who puts other people in service of her own neurotic agenda. I think people react so strongly because Jenny is just a mess in the way that so many people are.\\" Of her character's changes after season five, Kirshner stated: \\"I think she'll continue to be just like a tumbleweed and a car crash and I'm happy for that, I don't want it to be wrapped up. She'll never be normal and that's just the way it is.\\" Responding to the criticism Jenny has received, Kirshner states: \\"Well, I agree with what's said about the character for the most part. But again ... it's my job. So, I mean, it's a fun character.\\" Death In December 2008 it was announced that the show's creators had decided to kill the character off. It was confirmed that Jenny would still appear throughout the season in a \\"flashback\\" format. The first episode of the final season starts with Jenny's death. However the final series focuses on the events leading up to her death. Chaiken revealed that each episode would focus and tease with another motive. She described how it would play out, stating: \\"There's one character at the beginning of each show who comes forward with the motive of the moment. This would be my reason for killing Jenny.\\" The storyline was described as a \\"sub-plot\\" which would define the final season, but not \\"overpower\\" it. However, when the final episode aired there was no reveal to who killed Jenny. Showtime released a mini-series titled \\"Interrogation Tapes\\" online, via the official website. Each video featured a fellow character being interviewed over the death of Jenny - although the killer was still not revealed. Kate Aurthur of Los Angeles Times questioned if viewers would still want to watch the season after Jenny is killed. New York later gave a large amount of praise to Jenny commenting: \\"Jenny Schecter is The L Word, and the death of her is the death of the show.\\" Diane Shipley of The Guardian stated her death was long overdue. Websites started selling \\"I killed Jenny Schecter\\" merchandise. Lydia Martin of The Miami Herald said Chaiken was being manipulative not revealing Jenny's killer, so viewers would watch their online series. She also wanted to know \\"who the fuck\\" killed her because it did not give a \\"decent\\" ending to the show. Heather Hogan of AfterEllen stated that Jenny's ending was a dis-service to the character having never found out who killed her. When a sequel to the original series, called The L Word: Generation Q, was announced in 2019, main actress Jennifer Beals was asked about the issue of Jenny's death in an interview with People Now, and she answered \\"I can guarantee there will be resolution for fans on that issue (...) Complete resolution. It has to be answered.\\" Finally, in the second episode of the first season \\"Less Is More\\", aired on December 15, 2019, Jenny's death was described in passing as a suicide, a revelation that was described by some fans as anticlimactic.

During the going-away party held for Bette and Tina, who are planning on moving to New York, they watch the film and Jenny is found dead in the swimming pool in the back yard. It is assumed that she either fell or was pushed from the landing above the back steps, which is unfinished and lacks a proper railing. Because so many people have been offended, betrayed and hurt by Jenny, there are many suspects and they are interrogated. Reception In the book Blood Moon's GT Gay and Lesbian Film, Darwin Porter brands Jenny \\"one of the most annoying, needy characters on television\\" and calls her a \\"lost damaged soul\\". Fellow cast member Leisha Hailey has commented that Jenny is at her best when she is spiraling out of control. Hillary Frey of The New York Observer opined that Jenny provided \\"voyeuristic pleasure\\" for straight females in season one. She said she believed Jenny's confusion to whom she should be with was plausible. Also adding the fact she gradually became self-obsessed ‚Äì yet still conveyed the \\"thrill and pleasure of a fresh sexual experience\\", while portraying the sadness. Jenny was criticized by Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe for her narcissistic tendencies. Kera Bolonik of New York magazine stated that \\"Jenny-bashing\\" became a spectator sport from her inception. She also described Jenny's development as going through different stages stating: \\"Season 1: Selfish Jenny, Season 2: Victimized Jenny, Season 3: Heartless Jenny, Season 4: Vindictive Jenny, Season 5: Bitchy and narcissistic Jenny, Season 6: Dead Jenny.\\" New York magazine later praised Jenny stating: \\"We don't condone Jenny's narcissism, her prima-donna-ness, or her questionable writing skills. But she is highly entertaining ‚Äî and more important, her polarizing personality exposes the people around her.\\" In 2009 by the time season six was on air, the magazine claimed that Jenny was one step away from a Lesbian backlash, joking: \\"If only she would sing an acoustic version of the show's ear-melting theme song intermittently during the next episode to ensure that the entire Sapphic nation hits the streets bearing torches and pitchforks, all calling her name.\\" Mia Kirshner (pictured) played Jenny during all six seasons. New York magazine also describe the series and how Jenny took on the whole character traits of the show: \\"Like Jenny, The L Word was, at any given moment, capricious, obnoxious, patronizing, fabulous, fun, sexy, non sequitur, overreaching, under-reaching, annoying, and yes, unforgettable. Not one other character besides Jenny embodied the whole character of the show.\\" British lesbian magazine Diva call Jenny \\"the girl we love to hate.\\" They also opined that \\"poor old Jenny didn't have much going for her from the start.\\" That after her failed romances with Tim and Marina, she \\"got all pretentious\\" when she became an author. They also branded her the most hated lesbian character since Joan Ferguson (Maggie Kirkpatrick) on Prisoner: Cell Block H, credited most of the hatred upscaling when she had her dog put down and praised Kirshner for rising to the challenge of playing her. Jennifer Thomas of Pioneer Press compiled a list of 12 of the best TV characters of 2009; Jenny was number 7 on her list and stated: \\"Jenny is a rare combination of destruction, self-destruction, naivety and insanity. You can't help but want to strangle her, but then she goes all needy and fragile.\\" She also claimed that the season finale was a let-down, but Jenny would have been happy that even in death she was the center of attention and meddling in her friends lives. Thomas has also said: \\"Jenny has always been a complex, and fascinating character, who you occasionally want to slap and shake. (Or, in the case of the dog, just, well, murder her.) Without her, though, the show wouldn't be half as interesting. Just when you think you've seen every bit of crazy Jenny can dish out, she digs deep and finds some new neuroticism. She's fragile, but she's steel-spined when it comes to accepting responsibility for the havoc she wreaks in her life and everyone else's.\\" Matthew Gilbert of the Boston Globe compiled his list of most annoying TV characters. Jenny came second on the list and he stated: \\"Wow. The gods of narcissism blessed Jenny bigtime. She was just too, too self-centered. She sucked the life out of everyone who crossed her path.\\" He also opined that Kirshner's portrayal of Jenny's \\"vanity and chameleon-like qualities\\" was perhaps too convincing. He perceived scriptwriters as eventually understanding the \\"profundity of Jenny's annoying effect\\", and decided to escalate it. Gilbert concluded that in early seasons, when writers wanted the audience's sympathy with Jenny's journey of self- realization, he \\"wanted her to leave The Planet for good.\\" Regarding Jenny's mental state, Lydia Martin from The Miami Herald quipped \\"(Marina) sauntered into The Planet just to fuck with Jenny's head. As if Jenny's head needed the encouragement\\".

He was also mayor of the city in 1985‚Äì1990 and 1993‚Äì2000 and President of Italian Federation of American Football (FIDAF). He is best known for his strong opposition to the Sicilian Mafia during his mayoralty in the 1980s, which was publicly referenced in the media as the \\"Palermo Spring\\" (Italian: Primavera di Palermo). Biography Orlando was born in Palermo. He graduated in jurisprudence and worked as lawyer and professor at the University of Palermo. He was a member of Christian Democracy (DC), in the left wing of the party. He entered politics in 1976 as legal adviser to Christian Democratic reformer Piersanti Mattarella, who became president of the Sicilian Region in 1978. The two men set out to break the Mafia's hold on the island, transferring budget authority from the corrupt regional government back to the cities and passing a law enforcing the same building standards used in the rest of Italy, thereby making the Mafia's building schemes illegal.Mob Rule - Fighting the Mafia and Renewing Sicilian Culture - Review , National Review, 1 October 2001 In retaliation, the Mafia killed Mattarella in January 1980. The brother of Mattarella and other associates urged him to run for the Palermo municipal council, he ran successfully, and was elected mayor by the town council in 1985. From 1985-1990 he was elected mayor of Palermo, and received many threats as a result of his open opposition to the power of the Mafia in the city. He was re-elected as mayor in 1993 with 75.2% of the vote. In 1992 he was also elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies. Two years later he became a member of the European Parliament. Leoluca Orlando attacked harshly Giovanni Falcone accusing him of having \\"kept closed in the drawers\\" a series of documents concerning the excellent mafia crimes. The charges were also addressed to the judge Roberto Scarpinato and the prosecutor Pietro Giammanco, believed to be close to Andreotti. Falcone substantially dissented from Orlando's conclusions on political responsibilities regarding the actions of the mafia dome (the so-called \\"third level\\"), arguing as always the need for certain evidence and branding such claims as \\"political cynicism\\". Addressed directly to Orlando, he will say: \\"If the mayor of Palermo knows something, name and surname, cite the facts, take responsibility for what he said. Otherwise keep quiet: it is not lawful to speak in the absence of the interested parties\\". In 1996 he was investigated for aggravated corruption during the exercise of his duties as mayor of Palermo. The repentant Tullio Cannella says that in 1986 the municipality of Palermo, after a bribe of 200 million lire, bought the apartments of Joseph Bonanno, (born Giuseppe Carlo Bonanno), famous Italian-American crime boss of the Bonanno crime family, which he ran from 1931 to 1968. Recipients of the bribe, according to the repentant, were the Mayor Leoluca Orlando and the councilor Vincenzo Inzerillo, who at the time of the facts was in prison for 16 months for mafia. Orlando denies any responsibility.Centro Impastato Cronologia 1996 The affair for Leoluca Orlando had no judicial follow-up. After the dissolution of DC, he founded a popular movement called The Network (\\"La Rete\\"), which in 1999 joined with Romano Prodi's Democrats. In 2001 he was among the founders of The Daisy, an Italian party currently including most of the former left-wing members of DC. Since 2000, he has been the President of the \\"Sicilian Renaissance Institute\\" a non-profit organization dealing with the promotion of economy and culture of lawfulness and Human rights. In December 2000 he resigned from the position of mayor and was a candidate for the presidency of the autonomous region of Sicily. He was, however, defeated by the centre-right candidate Salvatore Cuffaro. In 2006 he was expelled from the Daisy party, after having shown his full support for the candidacy of Rita Borsellino in the Sicilian presidential centre-left primary election, contrary to the line of his party that supported its member . He subsequently joined the Italy of Values of Antonio Di Pietro with whom he was elected at the Italian Chamber of Deputies. He has been the President of the Parliamentary Commission for Regional affairs. In April 2008 he was re-elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies. On May 2007 he ran as centre-left candidate for mayor of Palermo, after having won the centre-left primary election in a landslide with about 72% of the votes. He however lost to incumbent Diego Cammarata of the House of Freedoms, who obtained about 53% of votes compared with Orlando's 45%. Results Following the results, Orlando denounced massive electoral frauds and asked for the annulment of the vote.Center-right wins Sicily mayorships; Berlusconi says it's the beginning of the end for Prodi, The Associated Press, 14 May 2007 In March 2012 he announced his candidacy for Mayor of Palermo as an independent in the May elections, after having unsuccessfully supported Rita Borsellino's mayoral bid in a controversial primary election won by his former prot√©g√© . In the first round, held on 5 May 2012, he was the most voted candidate with 48% of votes despite being only supported by his own Italy of Values and a number of minor left-wing parties (Federation of the Greens and Federation of the Left). He took part in the final round against second-placed Ferrandelli and on 21 May he won the runoff with 72% of the vote. He was re-elected for a personal fifth term as mayor in 2017, winning over 46% of votes in the first round. In June 2018, in defiance of orders from the Italian government, Orlando stated that he would allow the Aquarius, bearing 629 migrants rescued off the coast of Libya, to dock in Palermo. He stated \\"Palermo in ancient Greek meant ‚Äòcomplete port‚Äô. We have always welcomed rescue boats and vessels who saved lives at sea. We will not stop now.\\" In 2020 Orlando was nominated for the Four Freedoms Award, Freedom from Fear https://www.fourfreedoms.nl/en/laureaten/year:2020/award:freedom- from-fear-award/laureates:leoluca-orlando.htm.

Since 1998 it has been part of the K√ºstriner Vorland municipality. History Before the implementation of the Oder-Neisse line in 1945, Kietz was the western suburb of the town of K√ºstrin. According to the Allied Potsdam Agreement, it then became part of the Soviet occupation zone, while the remaining city districts formed present-day Kostrzyn nad OdrƒÖ in Poland. In 1954 the East German authorities made an attempt to rename the place Friedensfelde (literally: \\"fields of peace\\"), alluding to the Oder- Neisse line called \\"border of peace\\" in official usage. Ultimately the settlement retained its name Kietz, though without a mention of \\"K√ºstrin\\", which would have been considered revanchist by Communist officials. In a 1991 plebiscite the inhabitants voted for \\"K√ºstrin-Kietz\\".

Geography Fort Songadh is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Songadh It has an average elevation of 112 metres (367 feet). The town is located at the foot of a solitary hill, the surrounding area has been almost completely flattened by approximately 30 stone quarries. Due to these stone quarries, its economy has increased to the level of the rest of the state. Songadh's surrounding areas are covered with semi dense forest. The main town of Fort Songadh is located on Highway 6 with Nandurbar district to its east and Vyara (district headquarters) to its west. Surat is about 85 km from Songadh which has a higher population and substantially more industry. Surat has grown faster than other cities of Gujarat and consequently Tapi district was created from the former District of Surat and Vyara was selected as the capital of the Tapi district. Songadh is about 259 km from Vadodara, about 85 km from Surat, about 18 km from Vyara. The main town of Songadh is split into two parts; Junagam (old town) and Navagam (new town). Due to rapid expansion of the town in recent times, Navagam has outgrown the original Junagam and is characterised by the hustle and bustle of the Main Road almost any time of the day. This is largely due to the Bus Terminal which acts as a hub for cross country buses which are en route to the city of Surat. This passing traffic has bought much trade into Songadh as it is the first town as you enter Gujarat from the East (or the last before you leave from the West). To the west of Songadh is the district capital of Vyara which has a slightly smaller population but substantially more industry. Thus, Vyara has grown faster than Songadh.

Built deliberately on top of the high hill as a vantage point to keep an eye on enemies, the fort is also a brilliant example of Indian architecture where the influence of both Mughals and Marathas are evident. There are not many forts built in Gujarat State due to the relatively flat nature of the landscape. Neighbouring Maharashtra has comparatively many forts because of its topology. Maharashtra is guarded by Sahyadri Mountains. So the forts are in Maharashtra are very difficult to trek where as the fort in Songadh does not have much height and its takes approximately half an hour to reach the top of the fort.

She was ranked No. 10 in AfterEllen.com's Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. Fictional character biography Bette is introduced as an affluent, Ivy League-educated lesbian of African-American and Caucasian heritage. She grew up in Philadelphia and was an art history major at Yale, where she notably had sex with her boyfriend, Coleman. They both realized they were gay shortly after, with Bette developing a crush on her art history professor, Danica Palmer (Lifesize: 306). Eventually, she came out as a lesbian, and fell for her bisexual friend, Kelly. After Kelly rejected her advances, Bette grew depressed to the brink of suicide. After graduation, Bette moved on, and dated Alice Pieszecki briefly. Bette once fingered Alice while they were at the opera Lakm√© (during The Flower Duet). Though their relationship ended when Bette cheated on Alice, the two remained close friends afterwards. Bette met her future partner, Tina, while Tina was on a date at the Bette Porter Gallery with her then-boyfriend Eric. An instant attraction formed between the two of them. Bette noticed Tina's right earring had fallen off, and Tina supposedly put it back on. Later that night, Tina returned to the gallery to retrieve the lost earring. Bette had kept it for her. While Tina was picking it from her hand, Bette kissed her. Season one Bette and Tina's relationship appears to their friends as very strong. Tina confirms to their closest friends that Bette is her \\"first, last, and forever\\" love. However, from the very beginning they seem to have problems, and even as they attempt to start a family, it is revealed that they no longer make love. Although they seem to move past this problem as the series progresses, Bette's career in the California Arts Center is shown to come between them, with Bette frequently not having time to spend with Tina. At Bette's urging, Tina gives up her own career in order to have a child, leaving Bette as the sole breadwinner. Bette has a difficult family life, with her homophobic father Melvin only barely tolerating her relationship with Tina, and flatly refusing to acknowledge Tina's baby as his grandchild. Bette is also shown to be very bossy and domineering with Tina and everyone else. Throughout the entire series, Bette has a reputation for throwing fits and tantrums in public and private when things do not go her way. In addition, Bette at first has a difficult relationship with her older half-sister Kit, a recovering alcoholic who has often let her down. As the series progresses, however, Bette begins to support Kit's attempts to turn her life around, and their relationship is shown to improve. Tina's miscarriage takes a toll on Bette, and when her partner decides to become involved in a charitable organization, Bette finds that their careers make it almost impossible for them to spend any time together or have sex. At the same time, she finds herself drawn to Candace Jewell, a model-like carpenter temporarily working at the CAC. Bette tries to resist this attraction at first, but is unable to do so when Candace, despite knowing of Bette's relationship, makes a pass at her. Bette subsequently begins an affair with Candace to fulfill her sexual desires. When Tina discovers what is going on, she flies into a rage and, in the ensuing fight, Bette desperately tries to earn Tina's forgiveness by raping her, but Tina leaves Bette and moves out. Season two In the second season, Bette resumes her affair with Candace, but soon becomes desperate to make amends for her betrayal, and finds that her break-up with Tina is disrupting all other elements of her life. Her job becomes an increasing pressure, especially when Tina's new lover, Helena Peabody, is added to the Board of Directors, and her boss hires another curator who threatens Bette's elevated position. However, Tina refuses to forgive Bette, insinuating that she is only trying to mend their relationship because Candace is not sexually fulfilling enough for her. At first, Bette feels isolated from Alice (who hypocritically accuses Bette of being a \\"sex-addict\\" while she herself is having an affair with Dana, who is engaged to be married) and the others, who she feels have mainly taken Tina's side in their argument rather than remain neutral. Although Shane and Jenny are both supportive of her (mostly because of both Shane and Jenny, also both promiscuous, having cheated on their lovers as well), it takes a while for Bette to feel on good terms with Alice again. After Tina begins to see Helena, however, the group appear to rally around Bette, who is now aware that Tina is pregnant again and has a great desire to raise their child together. Matters are further complicated when it is revealed that Bette's father Melvin is dying from advanced prostate cancer, and is refusing treatment. A distraught Bette brings him home to die, so that he will not be trapped in a hospital, but this difficult experience leads her to reach out to Tina. Tina, who by now feels trapped by her relationship with Helena, grows closer to Bette again, and although Melvin never really blesses his daughter's homosexual relationship, he does once refer to Tina as 'Tina' rather than 'Miss Kennard' before he dies. His death is a great blow to Bette, who receives news of the loss of her job at Melvin's funeral. Though upset and furious, Bette continues to derive comfort from her improved relationship with Tina. Bette's relationship with Kit is also vastly improved in this season, with Kit being her main source of comfort at the beginning of the season. She helps Kit to take over The Planet cafe, and begins actively involving herself in Kit's life. Eventually Tina chooses Bette over Helena, and the end of the season shows Tina asking to move back in with Bette. Tina's labor is surprisingly difficult, but their daughter Angelica is eventually born, and the end of the season shows Bette as calm and happy in her new family. Season three Six months later, Bette and Tina are feeling the stress of raising Angelica, Bette's unemployment and Tina going back to work for Helena at her film studio. Their relationship experiences difficulties yet again when Tina claims to have a renewed interest in men. Angry and hurt with her belief that Tina was merely experimenting with her for eight years, Bette has her move out. Bette briefly becomes a Buddhist and goes on a silent retreat, but leaves it. In the meantime, Tina begins a relationship with a divorced father, Henry Young. When Henry's son Mikey innocently asks Bette to take a \\"family picture\\" of himself and Henry with Tina and Angelica, and Tina tells Bette to her face that she no longer wants Bette to adopt Angelica and that she and Henry are going to start a family with the implication that Henry will adopt Angelica, Bette comes to the realization that Tina is only using Henry and Mikey so that she will get full custody of Angelica when she and Bette separate, as she is Angelica's biological mother and deliberately ingratiating herself in what Bette calls the \\"safety of a white heterosexual family\\", after which she will leave Henry. Desperate not to lose Angelica, Bette hires Joyce Wishnea, a gay civil rights lawyer, in order to file for sole custody, and warns Tina to stop her farce with Henry. This time, most of their friends rally behind Bette, seeing Tina as a traitor to the LGBT community for using her sexuality and the country's homophobic legal system against Bette. Tina, however, stands her ground and considers the possibility of losing all of her friends as the \\"bravest thing she has ever done\\". At Shane and Carmen's wedding, Bette begins to have second thoughts about this, but when Tina gets Joyce's letter and begins to take action to separate Bette from Angelica forever, Bette kidnaps Angelica and runs away. Season four After being implored by her friends, Bette returns with Angelica, and Joyce persuades her and Tina to reach an agreement themselves on the basis that the homophobic court will most likely put Angelica up for adoption or into a heterosexual foster family instead of granting either of them custody. Soon after, Bette becomes the dean of art at a university. Her sexually frustrated boss, Phyllis Kroll, confesses to her that she is a lesbian, despite having a husband, Leonard. Later on, Bette introduces Phyllis to her group of friends, aware that she will end up having sex with one of them; Phyllis meets and has an affair with Alice, but despite being old enough to be her mother, she falls madly in love with her, which makes Bette feel uncomfortable, particularly when Alice refuses to commit to Phyllis and Bette gets caught in the middle. In desperation, Bette puts Phyllis in contact with Joyce to help her divorce Leonard, aware of Joyce's reputation for sleeping with her clients. Her plan works and Phyllis and Joyce begin a relationship, though Joyce is forced to recuse herself from representing Phyllis when it becomes more serious. While working at the California University School of the Arts as a dean, Bette has an affair with one of her graduate students, Nadia, but soon breaks off the relationship because she realizes it's inappropriate. Then, she begins a sexual relationship with Jodi Lerner, a sculptor who has begun lecturing at the university. Tina and Bette's relationship initially goes through some rough patches, but they gradually become friendlier with each other. Tina confesses to Bette that she still loves her and that she misses her life as a lesbian; when she meets Jodi, Tina realizes how much she wants Bette back and begins to regret ending her relationship with Bette. Tina learns of an affair between Angus (Kit's boyfriend) and Tina's nanny, Hazel, and she informs Bette. This causes major stress to their relationship, as Bette wants to keep this information from her sister and Tina disagrees. Things become even more complicated after a disastrous dinner party, thrown by Bette for Jodi, where she learns Kit‚Äîa recovering alcoholic‚Äîis drinking again to deal with Angus's infidelity. Because of Bette's reaction to her sister's drinking, Bette and Jodi get into a heated argument. As a result of the argument, Jodi realizes that Bette's controlling ways are too much for her and takes a job offer in New York City. In the season finale, Bette, with some encouragement from Tina and help from Alice and Shane, steals a \\"17 Reasons Why\\" sign from an old building in hopes of getting Jodi back, as Jodi had once told her that she believed it would make a great art piece. She shows it to Jodi, who is touched enough that she decides to remain in Los Angeles with Bette. Season five At the beginning of the fifth season, Bette and Jodi's relationship seems very loving to their friends. However, it doesn't take long before the problems begin to show. When Jodi insists on bringing Bette on her annual vacation with her close friends, Bette finds herself annoyed and upset with Jodi and her friend's activities. Though Bette continues her relationship with Jodi, she begins to long for the life she shared with Tina, particularly after Tina starts to manipulate Bette by talking about their past life and bragging about her affairs with other women. Bette soon succumbs to Tina's hints and they begin an affair, though they both claim to be unsure if they want anything more than their sexual reconnection. To manipulate Bette further out of sadness and longing, Tina begins a flirtation with Sam, a woman who works on the set of Lez Girls. Due to her own jealousy, Bette becomes angry with Jodi when Jodi decides to have a dinner party and invites Tina and Sam. When Jodi confronts Bette about their distance emotionally and sexually, Bette cannot bring herself to admit that she is still in love with Tina. During rolling blackouts, Bette and Tina are trapped in an elevator on the way to their couples therapy session. During their time in the elevator, Bette and Tina discuss their fears about their relationship and end up making love, during which Bette tells Tina she still loves her, even though Tina was once prepared to destroy their relationship for good through Henry. Bette also reveals to Tina she wants to tell Jodi about their reunion after the Subaru Pink Ride. Meanwhile, Jodi sees Bette is moody and upset about something but is not sure. By this time, Jodi has resigned from California University after one of her students held a realistic-looking gun made of soapstone to his head in front of the class as a form of art. While on their Subaru Pink Ride, Jodi learns of the affair during a game of 'I Never' when Alice drunkenly begins calling Bette a \\"giant and 'gi-normous' cheater\\" for having cheated on Tina and on Alice herself when they were dating. This statement leads Jodi to jokingly ask if Bette is cheating on her. When Bette doesn't respond and Tina gets up and runs away from the group, Jodi finally realizes that Bette is cheating on her and most likely never truly loved her from the start. In private, Kit verbally blasts Bette for her actions, reminding her of Tina's callous behavior while she was with Henry, but Bette confesses that, even though Tina was ready to take their daughter away from her and destroy their family forever, she loves and has always loved Tina, and that she and Jodi \\"never had a shot\\", effectively confirming that she was merely using Jodi sexually and never loved her. After the truth is revealed, Jodi returns to Bette and completely brushes off Tina. Bette takes Jodi to her house trying to talk things over but Jodi is adamant to get Bette back anyhow, leading to force her to have sex with her. Bette finally pushes her away and they agree to clarify things in Bette's office. It is here that Bette tells Jodi that their relationship will not work because Tina is her true love. Jodi concedes and leaves without further fight. She retrieves her personal items from Bette's place and leaves Bette an early birthday present. At the end of that eventful day, Bette joins Tina and takes both Angelica and Tina back home. With her real admiration for Jodi, Bette introduces Jodi at the public exhibition of a new Jodi Lerner piece, entitled \\"Core.\\" However, it instead turns out to be Jodi's spiteful revenge against Bette for using her: a series of videos of a single Bette saying \\"I love you\\", as well as things like \\"Leave me alone\\", \\"Go without me\\", \\"Stop\\", and \\"Fuck me\\", ridiculing Bette for her promiscuity and willingness to use anyone sexually. After the shocking public humiliation, Bette returns to find solace in Tina. Later, Bette and Tina go to Lez Girls wrap party where their reunion and display of affection is admired by their friends. Season six Tina moves back in with Bette, and they decide to adopt a second child. In preparation, they begin to add an expensive extension to their house. The pair finally meet the birth-mother Marci in Nevada, an underprivileged Caucasian woman expecting a half African-American son. Despite the fact that Marci's family rejects the notion of giving the child to a lesbian couple, Marci agrees to give Tina and Bette her child. However, this transaction is threatened when Joyce Wischnia informs the pair that Nevada law does not permit adoption to same sex couples. A solution is reached when Bette and Tina agree to board Marci during her pregnancy, but when they arrive to the Los Angeles bus station to meet her, Marci is not on the bus, having for some reason backed out on the deal. Meanwhile, as tension continues between Bette and Jodi due to Bette's infidelity, Bette tries to have Jodi fired and the matter is brought before Phyllis. Jodi refuses to resign and threatens legal action against Bette and the entire university should anyone fire her. Phyllis privately tries to convince Bette that Bette herself should resign instead, since she had already helped cover up a potential scandal involving Bette's brief fling with Nadia, and that any potential sexual harassment proceedings from Jodi would further endanger the university's reputation. Immediately afterwards, Phyllis makes a drunken pass at Bette at a bar, claiming she was always strongly attracted to her and can now pursue a relationship with her since Bette is no longer her employee, even if it means leaving Joyce. Finally fed up with Phyllis' sexual confusion and desperation, Bette rejects her advances and submits her resignation from the university. Bette later reconnects with her bisexual college crush Kelly Wentworth (Elizabeth Berkley), and the pair open an art gallery together. While Bette had strong feelings for Kelly in college to the point where she was on the brink of suicide when Kelly rejected her, she now seems quite capable of remaining committed to Tina despite the newly divorced Kelly's constant flirtations with her. Tina, however, subtly voices her lack of trust in Bette, especially after Kelly claims that Bette was a \\"player\\" during their college days, and starts to fear that Bette will eventually cheat on her again. When a drunken Kelly finally makes a pass at Bette in Bette's house, Bette soundly rejects her, but the pair remain on friendly terms. Then Kelly accidentally breaks a glass, and Bette helps her pick up the shards. An on-looking Jenny mistakes this activity for a sexual moment between the pair, and captures it on her cellphone camera. Later, an angry Jenny threatens Bette that she will expose the footage to Tina if Bette does not first confess her \\"umpteenth indiscretion\\" to Tina. When Tina gets a job offer in New York, she and Bette decide to relocate there and start a new life. Bette is more than happy to do this, partially to escape from the claustrophobic bubble of Los Angeles lesbian intrigue and partially to escape Jenny. She confides all of this to Kit, including Jenny's misconception. While in bed, Bette proposes to Tina, who accepts. At Bette and Tina's going away party in their home, Kit threatens Jenny to back off and is in turn shown the incriminating cellphone footage. Kit next confronts Bette, believing the footage to be a valid display of infidelity. Learning about the footage, and knowing that both of their previous affairs with Candace, Jodi and Henry will very easily convince Tina (who by now no longer trusts Bette fully) that she has cheated on her again, Bette finally approaches Jenny with a clear, furious warning to back off. This confrontation is held near a banister with an unfinished railing, and it is the last time Jenny is shown alive. Her body is discovered in the pool shortly afterwards. The series ends with Bette and all her friends being interrogated by police, and the truth of Jenny's death unexplained. The Interrogation Tapes Several weeks after the television series ends, footage of Bette's police interrogation appears on Showtime's L Word website (\\"The Interrogation Tapes\\"). For some reason, this footage leaked onto YouTube first. Although she does not divulge any information regarding Jenny's death, Bette confesses to being secretly angry and devastated by the fact that Tina never asked her to carry their second child (though it is left unrevealed why Bette herself did not suggest in it the first place).  Generation Q  In The L Word: Generation Q, set over ten years after Jenny's death, Bette is shown to be running for Mayor of Los Angeles. It is revealed that during the last ten years, Bette and Tina did get married, but also got divorced after Tina left Bette for another woman, Carrie, with Bette getting at least partially custody of Angelica, who now lives with her. Her relationship with Angelica is shown to be somewhat strained, due to Angelica frequently skipping school in secret to spend time smoking cannabis with her friend Jordi. Bette's candidacy is briefly threatened, however, when she refuses campaign funding from Dani N√∫√±ez, a PR executive for her father's company which invests in opioids, and when a man, Tyler Adams, openly accuses her of having previously had an affair with his wife Felicity, who at the time was one of Bette's employees, during one of her press conferences. In response, Bette appears on Alice's new talk show to tell her side of the story, and how despite being a biracial divorced lesbian, she essentially sees herself as an ordinary human being and only wants to make a difference to the world. Dani, whose fianc√© Sophie works for Alice, watches the broadcast and has a change of heart. After learning of the death of the son of one of her company's employees of an overdose, Dani offers to work for Bette, who accepts. On Dani's advice, Bette makes a public appearance for homeless and rejected members of the LGBT community to listen to their stories, and has a meeting with Felicity Adams in order to save her image from further scandal. In the process, Bette reveals to Dani her previous scandals such as her infidelities with both Tina and Jodi, her conflict with Faye Buckley which resulted in her spending one night in jail, and Jenny committing suicide in her swimming pool. In the meantime, Bette meets with Felicity in private at a park, and it is apparent that the two still have feelings for one another. Further trouble arises when Angie gets into a fight at school when one of her racist and homophobic classmates makes remarks about Bette; Angie is suspended by the homophobic school while her classmate is unpunished. Bette brings the subject up in her next mayoral conference and wins a grant from the education board, but at the same time resumes her affair with Felicity, jeopardizing her candidacy even further. Dani confronts Bette over the issue after seeing Felicity enter her bedroom and catching Bette with Felicity's phone, which she had taken by accident, but Bette reveals to Dani that her reason for running for Mayor is Kit's death from a heroin overdose, and that Felicity was the only one who comforted her in the aftermath. Later on, Bette celebrates Shane's 40th birthday at Shane's new gay bar, \\"Dana's\\". After further pushing from Dani, Bette ends her affair with Felicity, and later attends Angelica's school play. After the play, however, she is confronted by Tyler Adams and the press again, tipped off by a vengeful Felicity (who had actually taken advantage of Kit's death to have an affair with Bette and escape her false heterosexual life with Tyler, while never having any real feelings for Bette), and a scuffle ensues when Tyler tries to hit Angelica but is instead knocked to the ground and injured by Bette, threatening her campaign again. Distraught, Bette prepares to drop out, but is visited by Tina, who was called by Angelica, for support. Bette and Tina reminisce about their past experiences, though Bette remains bitter over Tina abandoning her and not even attending Kit's funeral. Finally, Bette is told by Dani that Tyler will not press charges as long as Bette publicly apologizes, but Bette refuses, on the basis that Tyler started the fight and she was merely defending her daughter, and instead makes a public statement, finally revealing that her reason for running for Mayor was due to Kit's heroin overdose which stemmed from a car accident that left her dependent on opioids, since the hospital, as a favour to the pharmaceutical companies running the country, deliberately did not ask Kit if she had a history of addiction. After the speech, Bette and Tina admit that to a certain degree, they still love each other, and share an embrace, during which Bette asks Tina not to leave. A while later, while at \\"Dana's\\", Tina asks Bette to dinner. At Bette's house, over dinner, Tina tells Bette that she is moving to Los Angeles. Hoping to rekindle their relationship despite Tina's past manipulative and abusive behavior, Bette invites Tina to move in for the time being, but Tina reveals that she and Carrie are getting married and are moving together in order to be closer to Angelica, and that she wants the three of them to tell Angelica together. Though visibly devastated by the fact that she has lost Tina forever, Bette gives Tina her blessing. Meanwhile, Bette's rival candidate, Jeff Milner, posts a homophobic advert on the internet denouncing Bette as a womanizer with no family values. Despite this, Bette refuses to give up and shares a drink with Dani. Bette ultimately loses the election to Milner, but later learns that Milner wants her to spearhead a campaign investigating the opioid crisis. However, Bette is informed by Dani that she is being set up, and Milner had long-since made a deal with Dani's father for opioid production. In her depression, Bette goes with Angie to the place Kit's ashes were scattered and meets one of the reporters covering her campaign, Maya, who invites her on a dinner date. Bette finally decides to move on from Tina, and accepts Maya's invitation. References * Kera Bolonik, The L Word: Welcome to Our Planet.

She was the daughter of King Chulalongkorn and Savang Vadhana. Her older brother Vajirunhis was the first Crown Prince of Siam. She was also the elder sister of Mahidol Adulyadej, the Prince of Songkla, and the full aunt of kings Ananda Mahidol and Bhumibol Adulyadej. Birth Princess Valaya Alongkorn was born on 16 April 1884 at Grand Palace. She was the 43rd daughter of King Chulalongkorn, and the 5th child of Savang Vadhana, princess consort and half-sister of King Chulalongkorn, (later Queen Sri Savarindira). Her full given name was Valaya Alongkorn Narindorn Debyakumari (), given by her father. She had 6 siblings, 3 elder brothers, 1 elder sister, 1 younger sister, and 1 younger brother: * Crown Prince Maha Vajirunhis of Siam (27 June 1878 - 4 January 1894) * Prince Isariyalongkorn (4 September 1879 - 25 September 1879) * Princess Vichitra Chiraprabha (21 April 1881 - 15 August 1881) * Prince Sommatiwongse Varodaya, the Prince of Nakhon Si Thammarat (9 June 1882 - 17 June 1899) * Princess Sirabhorn Sobhon (19 July 1888 - 24 May 1898) * Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, the Prince of Songkla, (posthumously The Prince Father of Thailand; 1 January 1891 - 24 September 1929) father of Galyani Vadhana, Ananda Mahidol, and Bhumibol Adulyadej. When she was 3 years old, her mother sent her to live with her own sister Queen Saovabha Phongsri, as an adopted daughter, due to Queen Saovabha having lost her own daughters: Bahurada Manimaya and a princess who died shortly after birth. They lived together at the Suddha Sri Abhiromya residence in the Inner court of the Grand Palace. Childhood The princess was educated at the Kumari Royal School, which was held classes inside the Amarin Winitchai Throne Hall. When her father, King Chulalongkorn visited southern Asia in 1896, she and many of her sisters accompanied him to a visit of Java, Singapore, and Malaya. After her father finished his 1st European tour, he built the Dusit Palace and other residences, including the Vimanmek Palace. At age 17 she moved and began living with her father, her mother, and her step-siblings in these new palaces. When the Four Seasons Garden Villa or Suan Si Ruedu was built she moved into this villa until her father's death on 23 October 1910. She then moved again to live with Queen Saovabha Phongsri at the Phayathai Palace. Lifestyle Princess Valaya Alongkorn was an avid reader. She was fond of books and read in her spare time, day and night, ever since she was a child. Her nanny had to hide her books to make her sleep. But this did not work, as she was able to find other books in her private library to read. In the afternoons once she was finished with her royal duties she always read or write. She also knitted and was an accomplished draughtsman. She was always dressed in European style. She did not like decorations for her dresses except pearl necklaces, which she made herself. When she went anywhere, she had her pearl necklace. Royal duties Valaya Alongkorn Rajabhat University Princess Alongkorn put a lot of importance on the education of Thai women. She was the patron of Rajini School, and established the other all-girls school, Rajini Bon School. She gave her own money to the Ministry of Education to build Vittayalongkorn Educational College (later Valaya Alongkorn Rajabhat University, Pathum Thani Province). She was close to her half-brother King Vajiravudh who succeeded to the throne after Chulalongkorn. Because of her excellent command of the English language she played a key role in the welcoming of many foreign guests, including foreign royalty, to the new king's coronation ceremony in 1911. On 11 November 1911, King Vajiravudh gave her the royal title of \\"The Princess of Bejraburi\\" (Krom Luang Bejraburi Rajasirindhorn ()). She was given the rank of Krom Luang, the 3rd level of the Krom ranks. When King Vajiravudh died in 1925, his younger brother, Prajadhipok succeeded to the throne. He asked the princess to design the dress of his wife Princess Rambhai Barni for the coronation ceremony as the new queen. The dress she designed was in European style and made Queen Rambhai Barni the biggest attraction in the ceremony. Later life Princess Valaya Alongkorn with her mother, Queen Sri Savarindira and Prince Mahidol Adulyadej After the death of Saovabha Phongsri on 20 October 1919 she moved from the Phayathai Palace to the Suan Sunandha Royal Villa, in the compound of Dusit Palace. One year later, she contracted a lung disease. She received treatment in Europe, and then moved to live in Srapathum Palace with her birth mother Savang Vadhana. She continued to have treatment for her illness until her death. She finally died on 15 February 1938 from lung cancer, at the age of 53. Her body was laid in the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall, Grand Palace. At the time, the government did not have enough money to build her Royal Crematorium in Sanam Luang. So King Ananda Mahidol (her nephew) and Savang Vadhana had to contribute funds from their own treasuries, supplemented by the government for the crematorium. The Royal Cremation ceremony took place on 14 May 1941. Queen Sri Savarindira was represented by King Ananda Mahidol, who performed all the royal cremation rites with other members of the Royal family. Later, King Anada Mahidol posthumously change her royal status from Somdet Phra Chao Boromwongse Ther to Somdet Phra Ratcha Pitucha (literally: \\"the Princess Aunt\\") as a mark of personal distinction.

A few of them made their own arrangements, but \\"it was squatters who made the East Bengali refugees famous or infamous.\\" Squatting (jabardakhal in Bengali) ranged from the forcible occupation of barracks to the collective take-over of private, government, and wasteland. By 1949, there were a total of 65 refugee colonies in the Dum Dum and Panihati zones. The squatters were in a way \\"self- settlers\\" in the absence of adequate official arrangements for rehabilitation. Within a very short time, the refugees (quite often with government/administrative support) not only found a place to stay but developed a society that included markets, schools, temples and sometimes even colleges, hospitals and recreational centres.Chatterjee, Nilanjana, \\"The East Bengal Refugees: A Lesson in Survival\\", in \\"Calcutta, The Living City\\" Vol II, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Pages 72-75, First published 1990, 2005 edition, Clive House on Rastraguru Avenue in Nagerbazar is mired in controversy. It is thought of as the first pucca brick and cement building in North Kolkata area and was possibly built by the Portuguese. Some say that it was the hunting lodge of an Indian prince or nobleman. What is known is that it was used by British soldiers when they first entered the country. Later, Robert Clive took the area over, renovated it, added a floor to the single-story building, and made it his country house around 1757-60. The house is located on raised ground in otherwise flat surroundings. When Clive House was excavated, a variety of artefacts were recovered, including coins, terracotta figures, sculptures, pottery and intelligence on a Portuguese fort. The articles found could be of the Sen period, or may alternatively have links with the ancient civilization unearthed earlier at Chandraketugarh. Clive House has been in the domain of the Archaeological Survey of India since 2004, but squatters inside and outside the structure have hindered restoration work.

She is played by American actress Laurel Holloman. Tina lives in Los Angeles, California, and mostly hangs out in West Hollywood. She is the mother of Angelica Porter-Kennard and initially the life partner of Bette Porter, though the two become on-again-off-again lovers in later seasons, and eventually marry and divorce between the events of The L Word and Generation Q. Storyline Back Story In the context of the six seasons of The L Word very little is said about Tina's background and nothing at all is revealed about her family. Only in the interrogation tapes, released online after the airing of the final episode of season 6, does Tina reveal some 'truths' about her upbringing. As a child, Tina and her two siblings were abruptly moved to Atlanta, Georgia by her mother when Tina's politician father refused to end his extramarital affair. Tina's first sexual relationship was an abusive relationship with her older sister. The relationship lasted three years, and later her sister became a Fundamentalist Christian to mask her homosexuality and hypocritically shunned Tina for being a lesbian. Tina kept this secret from everyone, including Bette, and only confessed it to interrogating police officers after Jenny Schecter's death. Prior to meeting Bette, Tina lived largely as a straight woman and had a few relationships, along with multiple abortions in her early twenties. Bette and Tina met when Tina's then-boyfriend Eric took her to the Bette Porter Gallery, where the two instantly became attracted to one another. Bette noticed Tina's right earring had fallen off. Despite the fact that Bette returned it to her, Tina left her earring at Bette's gallery so she could come back and get it later. Bette had kept it for her. While Tina was picking it from her hand, Bette kissed her. Shortly after, Tina left Eric to begin a relationship with Bette. Season 1 At the beginning of the first season, having been a couple for seven years, Tina and Bette are in the process searching for a sperm donor so that Tina can be artificially inseminated. After a successful insemination, Tina conceives, but suffers a miscarriage before she is even showing. This event is very traumatic for Tina, who finds comfort in working for a charity organization. Though she finds fulfillment there, her new career drives her further away from Bette. When Bette eventually has an affair with carpenter Candace Jewell, Tina confronts Bette about it and the two fight, leading to Bette raping Tina. Tina subsequently moves out of their shared house to live with Alice. Season 2 During the second season, Tina lives with Alice, and under her advice, decides to seek legal advice over her situation with Bette. It is then revealed that Tina secretly inseminated herself before she learned of Bette's affair, and is now several months pregnant. Not wanting anyone to know about this because of her broken relationship with Bette and previous miscarriage, Tina hides her expanding body with loose clothes. Eventually, Alice notices that Tina appears to have gained weight, and blames this on the breakup with Bette. She has a dinner with Bette at their former house and plans to tell Bette then, but is derailed when Bette begins dominating the conversation with discussions of her work problems. After her charity organisation is granted money from the Peabody Foundation, Tina begins a relationship with Helena Peabody. It is Helena who reveals Tina's condition to Bette, and the two are shown as having a rivalry for Tina's affections. Helena's promiscuity and possessiveness combine to push Tina back towards Bette, who in turn is reaching out to her over the loss of her father Melvin. Though Tina experiences a difficult and traumatic labour, her baby girl Angelica is delivered safely, and at the end of the season it is revealed that she plans to move back in with Bette and raise their baby together. Season 3 The third season is set six months after Angelica's birth, in which Tina and Bette are shown suffering more marital strife (including Bette losing her job at the CAC, and showing little interest in finding a new one). The couple appears to be more distant than ever; Bette seeks partner support from an overwhelmed Tina, who starts looking for the protection Bette cannot give her outside the home. Helena Peabody has just bought a movie studio, and offers Tina the chief development executive position. During this strife, Bette and Tina's communication breaks down. Tina begins to have feelings for men again, and Bette decides to go on a spiritual retreat. Because of this revelation, Bette decides to remove Tina's 'life-partner privileges'. During Bette's retreat, Tina (who has already had an online fling and also a frustrated attempt at fulfilling her interest with a male movie producer) meets Henry Young (Steven Eckholdt), a divorced man with one son, Mikey. After it becomes clear that their relationship is all but over, Tina begins a relationship with Henry. Bette and Tina have difficulties with a social worker who is tasked with evaluating their second-parent adoption process, who is both unimpressed with Bette's attitude towards finding another job and sows doubts in Tina about Bette adopting Angelica. As Tina and Henry (who claims to be unconcerned about Tina's past lesbian life and also shows doubts about Bette's parental rights) continue settling in, Bette decides to visit Joyce Wischnia (Jane Lynch), a gay civil rights lawyer known for sleeping with her clients and who Tina had previously contacted for her separation from Bette, in order to obtain full custody of Angelica. Later on, Bette decides to withdraw her sole custody petition, but the notification unfortunately reaches Joyce too late. Devastated after receiving Bette's sole custody petition, Tina decides to withdraw her consent for allowing Bette to become Angelica's other legal parent. At Shane and Carmen's wedding, tensions between Bette and Tina reach their peak and Tina tells her that she no longer wants Bette to adopt Angelica (referring to her as \\"my child\\"), and that she is going to start a family with Henry, who will adopt Angelica instead. The season closes with Tina and Henry returning to their hotel room and discovering Angelica is missing, having been kidnapped by Bette. Season 4 Bette, after realizing that she can't and shouldn't run with Angie forever, returns to LA. Though Tina appears ready to proceed with pressing charges against Bette, Joyce Wischnia chastises them both and persuades them to reach an agreement rather than let their daughter suffer the fallout. Though relations are generally strained between them at the start of the season, things gradually improve between the pair and they agree on shared custody. Relations with her close friends also show strain, as Alice and Jenny react negatively to Tina sleeping with men, something which Papi later chides them on. This distance leads to a heartfelt confession where Tina confesses to missing \\"the company of women.\\" She spends a lot of the season very socially isolated. Professionally, Tina is still working in the movie studio, \\"Peabody-Shaolin Film Studios\\", and acquires the rights to adapt for the screen a novel of Jenny Schecter's, \\"Lez Girls\\". Work on \\"Lez Girls\\" strains the relationship between her and Jenny due to their conflicting opinions on how the piece should be adapted, and also leads Tina to meeting Kate Arden (Annabella Sciorra), the selected director for \\"Lez Girls\\". It becomes apparent that there is a mutual attraction between the two, though due to her feelings for Bette yet again making themselves known, it doesn't go anywhere. Despite these feelings, Tina is very supportive of Bette's relationship with Jodi Lerner, going so far as to help Bette win her back at the end of the season. She ends the season single (though whether it was her attraction to Kate or Bette that caused her to break things off with Henry is unknown), but tentatively reconnected with her friends, Bette included. Season 5 Tina repeatedly clashes with Jenny while producing Lez Girls. Shane and Alice try to get Tina to date again as Bette and Jodi's relationship begins to get more serious, but it's clear that Tina is still hung up on Bette. She manages to have one successful date with a successful heart surgeon, Brenda, and sleeps with her on the first date, much to Bette's chagrin. However, at the SheBar opening, Tina confesses to Bette that she and Brenda are just having a little bit of fun and that Bette is lucky to have Jodi. Overcome with the emotion that has built between them and realizing how much she missed TIna, Bette kisses her and they start an affair. For a while, both Tina and Bette wonder if what is happening to them is nothing more than a sexual reconnection. During a blackout, Bette and Tina get stuck in an elevator on their way to their couples therapist. They reminisce on past events, both of them owning up to their flaws and what they put the other through. Bette tells Tina that she still loves her and they end up having sex. Though that marks their decision to get back together, they both agree to keep the affair a secret until after the Subaru Pink Ride. The truth of the affair comes out during the camp fire \\"I Never\\" game. Bette admits to her sister Kit that she loves Tina while Tina also admits to Shane and Alice that she too still loves Bette. Jodi brushes her off when Tina tries to apologize as Jodi picks up Bette at The Planet. After Bette breaks off the relationship and endures a shocking public humiliation at the first exhibition of a new Jodi Lerner piece, Bette finds comfort with Tina at the Lez Girls' wrap party. Season 6 Tina moves back in with Bette, and they decide to adopt a second child. In preparation, they begin to add an expensive extension to their house. The pair finally meet young pregnant Marci in Nevada, an underprivileged caucasian woman expecting a half African-American son. Despite the fact that Marci's family rejects the notion of giving the child to a lesbian couple, Marci agrees to give Tina and Bette her child. However, this transaction is threatened when Joyce Wishnea informs the pair that Nevada law does not permit adoption to same sex couples. A solution is reached when Bette and Tina agree to board Marci during her pregnancy, but when they arrive to the Los Angeles bus station to meet her, Marci is not on the bus. They later appear to abandon the hope of adopting Marci's child. Tina unknownly accepts a lunch meeting with filmmaker Dylan Moreland, only to learn that Dylan used the meeting as an excuse to recruit Tina to help her win back her ex-lover Helena. Aware that Dylan is straight and that she and her husband previously attempted to swindle Helena out of her fortune, Tina refuses the request. Meanwhile, Tina's job at the studio is threatened when the Lez Girls negative is stolen. Tina's boss Aaron believes Jenny is responsible for the theft and orders Tina to retrieve the negative from her. But when Tina confronts her, Jenny claims innocence and soon suggests that the film's hedge fund millionaire producer William was probably the true thief. Later, the negative is ransomed via correspondence faxed to the studio, signed by Tina and thereby implicating her as the thief. Tina is incredulous and afraid for her job, but finally snaps when she sees Aaron and William at a dinner meeting with new clients that she wasn't informed of. Believing herself to be already fired, she causes a scene, angrily accuses Aaron of mistreatment and William of theft, and quits. Also in this season, Bette reconnects with her bisexual college crush Kelly Wentworth, and the pair open an art gallery together. Though Kelly rejected Bette during their college days to the point that Bette considered suicide, Kelly makes constant flirtations towards Bette in front of Tina, referring to her as a \\"player\\". Bette reassures Tina that those days are over for her, that she is committed to her and only her, and despite her former insecurities, Tina trusts her, knowing that if Bette were to cheat again, that would be the end of them forever. Later on, Jenny manages to film an encounter between Bette and Kelly on her cellphone; as Bette is picking up broken glass from the floor, the angle from Jenny's window makes it look as though she is performing cunnilingus on Kelly. Jenny threatens Bette that she will show the footage to Tina, who she knows will believe it, unless Bette confesses the alleged indiscretion first. Tina soon finds herself in a new business meeting in New York, where she is offered her dream job. She and Bette decide to move to New York so Tina can take the job; to Tina's surprise, Bette asks her to marry her once they move, and she accepts. At their going away party in Los Angeles, Jenny prepares a video montage of several friends wishing them farewell. During the party, Shane leads Tina to Shane and Jenny's attic, where she has uncovered the missing Lez Girls negative. Tina is enraged, believing Jenny has stolen them and lied to her (the true thief is later revealed, via online interrogation tapes to be Jenny's ex-lover, Lez Girls actress Niki Stevens, who planted the negatives in Jenny's attic to save her career and destroy Jenny's). Shortly afterwards, Jenny is found dead in Bette and Tina's pool. The Interrogation Tapes One day after the television series ends, footage of Tina's police interrogation appears on Showtime's L Word website (\\"The Interrogation Tapes\\"), during which she reveals certain elements of her early life such as her adulterous father and the three years of sexual abuse she experienced at the hands of her older sister. The L Word: Generation Q By the time of Generation Q, set over ten years after Jenny's death, Bette and Tina did get married, but have since divorced. Bette is shown to have custody of Angelica, who now lives with her and refers to Tina as \\"Mama T\\", though they still communicate over matters regarding Angelica. Tina seems to stay in touch with her old friends, as she sends Shane flowers for her 40th birthday. After Bette comes into conflict with Tyler and Felicity Adams, both of whom seek to sabotage her campaign for Mayor of Los Angeles, Tina returns to offer Bette emotional support, having been called by Angie. Despite their troubled past, after Bette gives a speech revealing her reason for running for mayor and determination not to drop out, Bette and Tina admit that they still love each other to a certain degree, and share a hug, during which Bette asks Tina not to leave. Later, Tina meets up with Bette and Shane at Shane's new gay bar, \\"Dana's\\", where Tina asks Bette to dinner. The two meet up at Bette's house, where Tina reveals that she is moving to Los Angeles in order to be closer to Angie. Though Bette hopes to renew their relationship, Tina reveals that she is actually looking for a place for herself and Carrie, who she is going to marry, and that she wants to reveal it to Angie along with Bette and Carrie. Though obviously devastated by the news, Bette gives Tina her blessing. In the season finale of the series, Bette finally moves on from Tina by accepting a dinner date with Maya.

The legend begins with his grandfather Kui, a demigod who marries Puehuehu. Their son Vahi-vero was stolen by two wild ducks that carry him to a distant island where two witches Nua and Mere-hua imprison him. Kui eventually rescues his son, captures the witches, and kills the ducks. Once Vahi-vero reaches adulthood, he falls in love with a water-nymph Tahiti-tokerau, whom he persuades to marry him. She, however, is abducted by Puna, king of the underworld. Following his father's advice, he swims down to the underworld and rescues her while Puna is away. Shortly thereafter, Tahiti- tokerau becomes pregnant and gives birth to Rata. Not long after the birth of Rata, Puna returns and learns that Tahiti-tokerau had been rescued. He summons the shark Matuku-tagotago who attack Vahivero and Tahiti-tokerau while they are crabbing. The shark swallows them and takes them back to Kororupo where Tahiti-tokerau is buried head down in the sand. The orphan Rata is raised by his grandfather. When he learns of his parents' fate, he builds a large canoe to find them. Using his grandfather's magical adze, he enters the forest and chops down a tree. Overnight, however, goblins had restored the tree. He ambushes them and forces them to complete his canoe, which they accomplish in a single night. Rata then begins his quest to find his parents, which includes various adventures including defeating champion warrior Manu-kura in a contest for the hand of his wife, princess Pupura-to-te-tai, Puna's daughter. As he nears Puna's land he must overcome various monsters, including Matuku- tagotago, the shark that had killed his father, whom he cuts out of Matuku's belly. Rata, with the help of his servant Taraka, finally kills Puna, rescues his mother and restores her to health. They all return home.

The local people often refer to it as a Stonehenge in miniature, although the only thing the two stone rings have in common is that they both are made of stone positioned in a circular manner. The monument has a diameter of about 21 meters (69 feet) and consists of 16 raised stones. Some of the stones are up to 1.2 meters (4 feet) tall. Pilgrim's Route (St. Olafs vei) between Egersund and Sokndal goes right by the Stoplesteinan. It is visible as a green strip in the vegetation just next to the stone circle. Recently an information sign has been erected some 10 to 20 meters (30‚Äì60 feet) south-east of Stoplesteinan. Origin and Theories It is not known how or why the stone circle was constructed. Similar stone monuments exist across Northern Europe and the British Isles. Some of these have been excavated, and were found to be graves dating from the end of the Bronze Age until the end of the early Iron Age, dated to between 500 BC to 600 AD in Scandinavia. In Sweden there are a great number of similar circles called Domarringar (judge circles). They often have an odd number of stones, usually 7, 9 or 11. Often they also have a larger stone to the east, and most are burial sites from the late Iron Age. There are also stone settings with elliptical shape and sharp edges, thus resembling a ship. There are also theories that their shape could be used as a calendar based on the position of the sun. One such is Ale's Stones in Scania. An excavation at Stoplesteinan during the 1930s found that the ground in the circle's center is paved with stones. Traces of burnt material were also found, lending credence to the theory that it is located at a place of burial.

It is an important pilgrim centre and the site of the famous Thanumalayan Temple. There is an Anjaneya, (or Hanuman), statue which stands at 22 feet (6.7 m) and is carved of a single granite block. It is one of the tallest statues of its type in India. Geography Suchindram is located at Kanyakumari District.Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Suchindram It has an average elevation of 19 metres (62 feet). Suchindram is a temple town situated in the southernmost district of Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu, India. It is 11 km from Kanyakumari city and 7 km from Nagarcoil town 105 km from adjacent Tirunelveli district and approximately 81 km from Trivandrum city. The town of Suchindrum is renowned for the Thanumalayan Temple and was an important citadel of Travancore. Suchindram temple is unique in the whole of India in that it is dedicated to three different deities represented by one image in the sanctum and is called Sthanumalayan (Sthanu-Shiva; Maal-Vishnu and Ayan-Brahma) kovil. The temple is rich in sculpture and architecture and a visitor to this temple is amply rewarded with the sight of such exquisite art of hundreds of years old Location Suchindram is about 11 km from Kanyakumari and about 7 km from Nagarkoil lying between these two towns. Busses ply from Thirunelveli, Kanyakumari and Trivandram. The nearest railway station is Nagarkoil on the Trivandrum - Kanyakumari section of the Southern Railway. The Temple The entrance tower to this temple is visible from a distance as it rises majestically for 134 feet. The face of the tower is covered with sculptures and statues from Hindu Scriptures. There is a covered area in front of the main entrance and the entrance itself is about 24 feet high with a beautifully carved door. There is only one corridor running along the outer wall of the temple with many shrines and mandapams scattered in the inner area. This temple attracts both Vaishnavites and Saivites in large numbers. About 30 shrines to various deities within the temple complex, the large Lingam in the sanctum, the idol of Vishnu in the adjacent shrine and a large idol of Hanuman at the Eastern end of the Northern corridor represent almost all the deities of the Hindu pantheon. Legends There are many legends associated with this temple. Anasuya, the wife of Atri Maharishi was famous for her chastity and her devotion to her husband - an embodiment of a Hindu wife. She could perform miracles by sprinkling the 'paatha theertham' (water with which she washed her husband's feet) to bring rain to a parched earth or to transform objects to her desire. When the three Devis, - Goddesses Lakshmi, Saraswathy and Parvathy(athishakthi) heard through Sage Naradha the powers of this earthly woman they wanted to test her chastity. They approached their husbands Lords Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva to test Anasuya's devotion to her husband. The three Moorthys transformed into three old mendicants and went to the hermitage where Anasuya was living and sought alms from her. When Anasuya was about to serve them food they told her that they had taken a vow whereby they could not accept alms from a person wearing clothes. As it was a sin to refuse alms to mendicants she prayed to her Lord and sprinkled a little 'paatha theertham' on the three old beggars. They were all immediately transformed into babies and throwing off her clothes she offered them food. The Goddesses learning what had happened pleaded with Anasuya to grant them 'maankalya biksha' (gift of married life) and to give them back their husbands. Anasuya showed them the three babies. The Devis ran to the cradle and picked one baby each. Anasuya then prayed to her Lord to restore them back to their original form. Lo and behold! Lord Sri Vishnu was in Lakshmi's embrace, Siva in Parvathy's lap and Saraswathy with Brahma. They accepted that Anasuya's fame as the chastest woman on earth was justified. Thus the Thrimoorthy came to be represented by the Lingam at Suchindram; the bottom represents Brahma, the middle represents Vishnu and the top Shiva. There is another lore associated with this temple. Once Indra was infatuated with Ahalya, the wife of Rishi Gautama. One night he came to the hermitage where Gautama was living and crowed like a cock indicating the approach of dawn. Rishi Gautama thinking that dawn was imminent awoke from his sleep and went to the river for his ablutions prior to commencing his prayers. Realising that it was too dark for dawn and too early for morning to break he returned to his hut. In the meantime Lord Indra took the physical appearance of Rishi Gautama, approached Ahalya to satisfied his desire. Rishi Gautama returning from the river was enraged when he saw his wife with another man in Rishis appearance and cursed the man's entire body be covered with 'eyes' (due to his bad desire where he wants to see other wife who does not belongs to him) and his wife Ahalya to become a statue of stone(but later she rid from the curse by Rama). Lord Indra in order to get rid of this curse went to Gnanaranya and prayed to the Three Moorthys to rid him of this curse. When he was rid of his curse and transformed into his original form he built a temple and installed the Lingam to represent the three Moorthy - Thanu-Maal-Ayan, and the name of the place came to be known as Suchi-Aendran (the place where king[Indra] was purified). Festivals There are two important festivals, one in Markazhi (December/January) and the other in Chiththirai (April/May). During the Markazhi festival, on the 9th day the deities are taken out in procession around the streets on three festival cars. visit: http://www.suchindrumfestival.com/ Interesting Features The temple has quite a few sculptures and art. In the 'Alankara mandapam' adjacent to the Northern corridor there are four large pillars each formed by a group of smaller pillars all carved from a single stone. Two of these large pillars have 33 smaller pillars and the other two 25 each. These are the famous musical pillars. Each of these smaller pillars produce a different musical note when tapped. Unfortunately these pillars are surrounded by iron grills to prevent vandalism. Step out of the 'Alankara mandapam' and you come face to face with a gigantic figure of Hanuman. The figure is 18 feet high and depicts 'visuvaroopam'. There are other carvings and sculptures on every pillar and panel throughout the temple, which are a feast to the eye and the imagination. The town along with Kanyakumari was part of Travancore. It became part of Tamil Nadu in 1956. The place is not far from colachel where the historic naval battle between the Dutch and Travancore was fought. Demographics India census, Suchindram had a population of 11,953.

The event was seen live on pay per view in the United States, and later released on home video. History UFC 9 was the first UFC production not to feature the tournament format (which was brought back by popular demand at UFC 10). Instead, it featured an entire card of regular bouts. The card featured seven bouts and an alternate bout to fill time for the pay-per-view broadcast. The main event was the highly anticipated rematch between reigning UFC Superfight Champion Ken Shamrock and number one contender Dan Severn, who had fought one year earlier at UFC 6 for the UFC Superfight Championship, with Shamrock reigning victorious. The UFC drew national criticism leading up to the event, due in large part to Arizona Senator John McCain's letter writing campaign against the \\"brutal spectacle\\" of no holds barred fighting. After a legal battle in the Detroit courts up until 4:30 p.m. on the day of the show, the UFC was allowed to continue, but with modified rules. The special rules included no closed fisted strikes to the head and no headbutts ‚Äì a rule that referee John McCarthy attempted to enforce, but with little success. Before the show, fighters were warned not to use closed fisted strikes under penalty of arrest. Although many fights that night included closed fisted striking, no fighters were arrested. Due in part to this special rule, the Superfight between Dan Severn and Ken Shamrock is widely considered one of the worst MMA fights of all time, with the fighters circling each other for nearly 20 minutes with little or no contact. Aftermath Following the legal battle over UFC 9, Senator John McCain was successful in pulling UFC pay-per-view broadcasts from numerous cable systems, including TCI cable, which greatly hurt pay per view buy rates.

Biface Lower Paleolithic Former collection of Edward John Dunn - Museum of Toulouse Early life Dunn was born at Bedminster near Bristol, England, the son of Edward Herbert Dunn and Betsy Robinson Dunn. The family emigrated to New South Wales in 1849, initially living near Goulburn, New South Wales then in Beechworth, Victoria from 1856. Dunn was educated at the Beechworth Church of England school and later by a tutor. Dunn was a collector of rocks and minerals from boyhood. Geological career Dunn entered the Beechworth land survey office and had experience in surveying. In 1864 he joined the geological survey under Alfred Richard Cecil Selwyn and was trained in geological work by Georg Heinrich Friedrich Ulrich. He remained with the survey until it was abolished in 1869; in that year he became qualified as a mining surveyor. In 1871 Dunn returned to England, via South Africa, where he was government geologist for the Cape Colony reporting on mines. He prepared the first geological map of South Africa and had a part in the discovery of diamonds. In 1872 Dunn travelled through Bushmanland accompanied by 15 troopers of the Northern Border police. He gathered much information about the Bushmen which he embodied in his work on The Bushman, which, however, was not published until nearly 60 years later. In 1873 he went to London, studied at the school of mines, Jermyn Street, and obtained his certificate for assaying. In 1883 he predicted that the Transvaal would become an infinitely richer gold-bearing country than any yet discovered. Dunn returned to Victoria in 1886 and went into private practice. As a result of one of his reports the coalfield at Korumburra, Victoria, was developed. Dunn was appointed director of the geological survey of Victoria in 1904, and in 1905 was awarded the Murchison Medal by the Geological Society of London. Dunn used the award money to publish his monograph on Pebbles, which appeared in 1911. Dunn was elected President of the Royal Society of Victoria in 1906. He retired from the Geological Survey of Victoria in 1912, but kept up his interest in his subject through an energetic old age. Late life At age 84, Dunn published a comprehensive work on the Geology of Gold (1929); his book on The Bushman, based on his South Africa experience, came out two years later. Dunn died on 20 April 1937. He married in 1875 Elizabeth Julie Perchard who survived him with a son and two daughters. A list of his publications can be found in In Memory of Edward John Dunn, Melbourne, 1937. His collection of Bushmen objects was given to the Pitt Rivers museum at Oxford, his australites and pebbles went to the British Museum, and his collection of Victorian stones were bequeathed to the mines department museum, Melbourne.

The black rivulet (Kali Bein) ran through the center of the city. These features are more than enough to hold that Sultanpur Lodhi was a big city in old times. Sultanpur Lodhi was mentioned as important place in famous \\"Ain-e-Akbari\\". The city in those times had many Royal Gardens and farms. At present, relics of these royal buildings built at that time, are still present. One of these is \\"Hadera\\". It was once a marvelous building used as place of rest for the royal family on their way to royal gardens. It was also used as place of entertainment for royal family and to organize dances and other royal functions. This place is now just an old & neglected building. Sultanpur Lodhi, in those days was not only famous for its surroundings & trade, but also for its education. City had many Islamic schools of education known as \\"Madarasas\\". The two princes of Delhi, Aurengzeb and Dara-sekoh completed their studies in one white mosque of Sultanpur Lodhi. At the end of the 14th century, the governor of Lahore was Daulat Khan Lodi. Sultanpur Lodhi was also called ‚ÄòPerran Puri‚Äô {city of monks}. Many religious personalities were related to the city at that time and some of the tombs {Makbaras} of these monks are still present in the city. After Nanakana Sahib {now in Pakistan}, Sultanpur Lodhi is perhaps the most related to life of the first Sikh Guru. In 1475 AD elder sister of Guru Ji, Bibi Nanki Ji was married to Shri Jai Ram of Sultanpur Lodhi. In 1483 Guru Ji's father sent Guru Ji to the custody of Shri Jai Ram. Guru Ji was employed as the Modi {Person In- charge} of the Modi Khana {Civil supplies store}. In June 1488, Guru Nanak Dev Ji was married to Bibi Sulkhani ji in Sultanpur Lodhi. And here, in this city Guru Ji begot two sons, in July 1494 Shri Chand Ji and in Feb 1497 Lakmi Chand Ji. In this very city Guru Ji spent more than 14 years and in 1497 Guru Ji disappeared in holy Rivulet (Kali Bein) flowing along the North end of the city and then Re-Appeared after three days with the teaching of \\"na koi hindu, na koi muslman\\" {no one is Hindu, no one is Muslim}. This led to the birth of a new religion, Sikhism. Thereafter Guru Ji left his job and the City to start with the First Udasi {Sacramental Journey}. After Guru Nanak Dev Ji, Fifth Guru sahib Guru Arjan Dev Ji, on occasion of his son Guru Hargobind sahib's marriage in a nearby village Dhalla rested at Sultanpur Lodhi. A Gurudwara having Sehra and wedding costume of Guru Ji, is built at that place. 1526 AD Some Lodhi tribes travelled to Pakistan. Choura Baz Khan Lodhi traveled to Mohib Banda, Mardan, KPK, Pakistan. Modern In 1739 Nader Shah, the famous invader, on his way to Delhi, invaded Sultanpur Lodhi and almost destroyed it. After looting the whole city, it was set on fire. After that Ahmed Shah Abdali again destroyed it. Later Sardar Jassa Singh Ahluwalia, after taking the historic monuments under his custody, re established this city ab-initio. But it could not re-gain its old prestige and glory. One of the reason has been, the development of Amritsar-Jalandhar G.T. Road as the main route for commutation to Delhi. One of the accomplice of Maharaja Jagajit Singh of Kapurthala was Dewan Ramjas, of Sultanpur Lodhi; later his sons worked for the Kapurthala Royal family, Dewan Mathura Dass, Dewan Daulat Ram & Dewan Jarmani Dass( 1895‚Äì1971) who wrote the book \\"Maharaja & Maharani\\" in 1970. Dewan Ramjas and family were given many villages for the services.

It is here that he gained enlightenment at the end of the 15th century. It is said he disappeared into the waters of the Bein rivulet, reappearing three days later as the enlightened Guru. His first words were as simple as they were true: ‚ÄòThere is no Hindu, no Mussalman‚Äô.  Gurudwara Shri Ber Sahib  Gurudwara Ber Sahib The best Gurudwara Shri Ber Sahib, the principal shrine at Sultanpur, is situated on the bank of the rivulet Kali Bein. Guru Nanak performed his morning ablutions in the Bein and then sat under a Ber (Zizyphus jujuba) tree to meditate. Guru Ji meditated at this tree daily for 14 years, nine months and 13 days. It was during one such ablution that Guru Nanak had what is described, in the Janam Sakhis, as a direct communion with the Divine. As the Janam Sakhis narrate the details, Guru Nanak one morning disappeared into the stream and was not seen for two days. When he reappeared at a spot, 2 km upstream, now known as Sant Ghat, the first words he uttered were, \\"No one is Hindu, No one is Musalman (Muslim).\\" Guru Nanak was now ready to embark on his long journeys. Gurudwara Ber Sahib is built by the side of an old ber tree which is believed to be the one under which Guru Nanak would sit in meditation. The present building of Gurudwara Ber Sahib was built by Maharaja Jagatjit Singh of Kapurthala. The cornerstone was laid by Bhai Arjan Singh of Bagarian on 25 February 1937, and the Gurudwara was on completion dedicated by Lieutenant General Maharaja Yadavinder Singh of Patiala on 26 January 1941. Standing on a high plinth and entered through a portico, supported by octagonal columns, and a small entrance gallery is the high ceiling, marble floored hall. At the far end, marked off by a high archway decorated with floral designs in stucco, is the sanctum sanctorum, where the Guru Granth Sahib is seated on a white marble canopied throne. Besides the daily services and observance of important Sikh anniversaries, a largely attended fair takes place on each birthday of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.  Gurudwara Shri Hatt Sahib  Gurudwara Hatt Sahib Measuring Stones used by Guru Nanak Dev Ji As a young man Guru Nanak was convinced by his family to accept employment here as the accountant of the provisions of Nawab Daulat Khan Lodhi. Guru Nanak got the job on the recommendations of his brother-in-law Jai Ram. The Nawab was very much impressed by the young Guru who would work diligently in the day and spend the evenings and night singing the praises of God with his friends.  Gurudwara Shri Kothri Sahib  Gurudwara Kothri Sahib Kothri(holding cell) in which Guru Nanak Dev Ji was kept Guru Nanak Dev ji worked for Nawab Daulat Khan Lodhi as in-charge of accounts. It was falsely reported to the Nawab by jealous elements that the Guru was stealing from the inventory as his predecessor had. So. Guru Ji was briefly jailed here. But when the accounts & the inventory where checked and found to be correct, the Nawab released Guru Nanak & apologized profusely, even offering Guru Nanak a promotion. Guru Nanak refused to accept the position as he had decided to dedicate his life to spread the Doctrine of Humanity, Dedication, Compassion, Love leading to be a God's Sikh (Spiritual Apprentice)  Gurudwara Shri Guru Ka Bagh  Gurudwara Guru Ka Bagh Guru Nanak Dev ji spent 14 years in Sultanpur Lodhi as a young man in this house of Guru Nanak where his two sons Baba Sri Chand and Baba Lakhmi Chand were born. Guru Nanak tested his two sons, but neither proved worthy of being his successor. Baba Lakhmi Chand was too involved in worldly affairs while Baba Sri Chand chose the path of renunciation and became an aesthetic. Guru Sahib used to have Langar prepared by Bibi Nanaki ji. Well (Khooh) is also located here, from which water was used for Langar Preparation.  Gurudwara Shri Sant Ghat  Gurudwara Shri Santghaat Sahib It is situated on the bank of the river \\"Bein\\". From the Ber Sahib, Guru Nanak Dev Ji dived into Bein & disappeared for 3 days. On reaching Nirankar's place Sachkhand, he got Satnaam's Updesh \\" Mool Mantar\\" from Nirankar which he gave to the whole world. The big reason for this place to be named Sant Ghaat is that Guru Nanak Dev ji meditated here to the God Almighty & went from here to serve the World  Gurudwara Shri Antaryamta  Gurudwara Antaryamta sahib The Muslims asked Guru Nanak Dev Ji whether he was a Guru for the Hindus or Muslims. Guru Nanak dev Ji replied that he is common to followers of both religions. The Muslims then requested him to attend Namaaz (prayers observed by Muslims), because he claimed to be a Guru for both Hindus and Muslims. Guru Nanak Dev Ji went along. Everyone stood in the mosque in order to offer Namaaz and started offering prayers (kneeling) but Guru Nanak Dev Ji kept standing straight. After offering Namaaz, the Muslims angrily asked as to why didn't he offer prayers to which Guru ji replied that they hadn't offered prayers either. Nawab said that they did offer prayers. Guru ji said that your heart was away to get horses from Kandahar. You were physically present here and so was I, but not mentally. On hearing this khan said that the Guru should have offered prayers along with the priest. Guru Nanak Dev Ji replied that even he was physically present here but his mind was taking care of the new born female calf at home to ensure that the calf didn't fall into a well. Then everybody bowed to Guru Ji's and said that he is a saint with the divine powers. The Gurudwara is situated at the same place where this incident happened.  Gurudwara Shri Sehra Sahib  Gurudwara Sehra Sahib Gurudwara Shree Sehra Sahib situated in Mohalla Dhiraan here is dedicated to Guru Arjan Dev Ji, who passed through Sultanpur in 1604 on his way to Dalla for the marriage of his son, Har Gobind, the future Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji (revered for his concept of miri and piri). According to tradition, the marriage party stayed overnight at this place and the sehra, or ceremonial wreath was fastened round the bridegroom's head here. The Gurudwara, within a brick paved walled compound, is an octagonal domed room in which the Guru Granth Sahib is seated.  Gurudwara Shri Bebe Nanki Ji  Gurudwara Bebe Nanaki Ji Constructed in the 1970s, honours the memory of Bebe Nanaki, elder sister of Guru Nanak. The actual house, a three storeyed old building where Bebe Nanaki is believed to have lived with her husband, Jai Ram, is inside the old town in Mohalla Chhimbian. But the premises being in private possession, a public monument (cornerstone, laid on 13 November 1970) was raised in the form of a Gurdwara by Bebe Nanaki Istri Satsang Charitable Trust under the chairmanship of Bibi Balvant Kaur of Birmingham (United Kingdom). The Gurdwara Bebe Nanaki Ji comprises a central hall, with the Guru Granth Sahib seated in a white marble palaki at the far end. The Guru Granth Sahib is also seated in a small side room symbolizing Bebe Nanaki's own lodging. Over the sanctum, above the hall roof, is a square domed room with arched copings. Bulbous domes adorn the corners of the hall roof.  Sant Babir Singh Ji Seechewal  Kali Vain Few years back Kali Vain At present Cleaning process Kali Vain At present Kali Bein, a 99-mile-long (160 km) river, is considered sacred by the state's majority Sikh population. Over the past couple of decades, it was reduced to a filthy drain into which six towns and more than 40 villages emptied their waste. Parts of the river dried up, leaving neighboring farmlands parched. Its polluted waters also seeped underground, contaminating the groundwater and causing lethal diseases. Seechewal, a Sikh holy man, set out to clean up this mess. Drawing on the Sikh tradition of kar sewa (voluntary service), he and his followers taught locals why they should clean the Kali Bein, enlisting volunteers to do the physical work and raising funds for equipment. At the height of his movement, people from more than two dozen villages were pitching in. The scale of the task was gigantic ‚Äî volunteers cleared the entire riverbed of water hyacinth and silt and built riverbanks and roads alongside the river. When appeals to government and municipal bodies failed to stop dirty water flowing into the river, Seechewal launched a public-awareness campaign to encourage villagers to dispose of their sewage elsewhere. Some villages revived traditional methods of waste disposal and treatment, and farmers lined up for a share of the treated water. A government order to divert water from a nearby canal was eventually obtained. As the riverbed was cleared, natural springs revived and the river began to fill up. Since then, trees have been planted along its banks and fishing has been banned to preserve bi-odiversity. Today, the Kali Bein is thriving. Families head there for picnics and the devout bathe during religious festivals. Seechewal has turned his sight to the tanneries and other factories that dispose of untreated waste in rivers. He is also leading efforts to get residents and the government to clean up rivers and creeks in a more systematic way across the state. \\"We have proved that it is possible to restore our rivers to a pristine condition if we all come together,\\" says Seechewal. \\"It is time to do that on a bigger scale.\\"  550th Parkash Purab of Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji  Sultanpur Lodhi received a plethora of developmental activities by State Govt. during 2018‚Äì19, on account of the 550th birth anniversary of the first Sikh guru and founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak Dev.

The next day when he woke up, to his surprise he found all his bags contained pepper. Then he realized the person who came the previous day was not an ordinary man but the god Balaji. He immediately went before the statue and cried for forgiveness. Balaji appeared before him and told that he would be forgiven if he renovated the temple and the temple gave out pepper to all of his worshippers from that day forth.

It is said that Sita, wife of Lord Rama, washed her hair in this tank when she was turned out of the house by Rama. Even now the widows of the surrounding area come here and wash ltheir hair.

In The Geographical Dictionary of Ancient And Mediaeval India 1927) The Mubarak Shahi gives us some idea of Firuz Shah‚Äôs canal digging activity during this period. The river Sarsati (Saraswati) comes from the great mountains and falls into the Sutlej. An earthen hillock near a place called Barwar, Firuz was informed, separated the River Saraswati from the Salima canal (of Firuz Shah). If this hillock was dug up, the water of the Saraswati would flow into the canal which could then be taken to Sahrind or Sirhind, Mansurpura and further on to Sunam. Firuz went to the place and began digging up the hillock. Gurudwaras There are number of Gurudwaras in Sunam. The most well known is the Gurdwara of the first Guruji Guru Nanak Dev Ji.

Early 40 BC. AR Denarius. Uncertain mint in Syria or southeastern Asia Minor. Quintus Labienus Parthicus (died 39 BC) was a Roman general in the Late Republic period. The son of Titus Labienus, he made an alliance with Parthia and invaded the Roman provinces in the eastern Mediterranean which were under the control of Mark Antony. He occupied the Roman province of Syria together with the Parthians in 40 BC. He then pushed into southern Anatolia, still with Parthian support. The main Parthian force took charge of Syria and invaded Judea. Both Labienus and the Parthians were defeated by Publius Ventidius Bassus, who recovered these provinces for Mark Antony. Liberators' Civil War After the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC, there was a civil war between the Caesarians, the supporters of Caesar, and the Pompeians, the supporters of Pompey, who had led the forces of the Roman senate against Caesar during Caesar's Civil War (49-45 BC). In this civil war, the Liberators' Civil War (43-42 BC), the Pompeians were led by Gaius Cassius Longinus and Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger, the leaders of the conspiracy to murder Caesar. They fought against Octavian and Mark Antony, two members of the Second Triumvirate, an alliance between the three leaders of the Caesarians. Cassius and Brutus were defeated at the Battle of Phillipi in October 42 BC. Labienus tried to resurrect the Pompeian cause with the help of the Parthians. Continuing the Pompeian cause According to Festus, Labienus fled to Persia.Festus, Summary of the history of Rome, 18. However, according to Cassius Dio, he was instead sent by Brutus and Cassius to Orodes II, the king of Parthia, to obtain reinforcements before the Battle of Phillipi. He was kept there for a long time as Orodes was waiting to see how things would turn out. Labienus remained in Parthia when he heard of the defeat at Phillipi for fear of reprisals by the victors. When he saw that Mark Antony misruled his provinces in the east and that he went to Egypt, he persuaded Orodes to attack the Romans. He told him that some of their armies had been destroyed or impaired in the battle and other armies were mutinous. He advised him to invade Syria while Mark Antony was in Egypt and told him that many Roman provinces would welcome him as they had been alienated by Antony's mistreatment. He offered to take the command of his troops. Orodes was persuaded to wage war and entrusted a large force to Labienus and his son Pacorus I.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 48.24.4-8, 25.1 Plutarch, instead, wrote that the Parthian generals appointed Labienus commander-in‚Äëchief of a Parthian army which was hovering in Mesopotamia and was about to invade Syria.Plutarch, The Live of Antony, 28.1 According to Justin, it was Pacorus who had the leadership of the invading force.Justin, Epitome of Pompeius Trogus' Philippic Histories, 42.4 Justin thought the Parthians took the side of the Pompeians and allied with Labienus because they had formed a friendship with Pompey in the Third Mithridatic war (73-63 BC) and because they had defeated and killed Marcus Licinius Crassus, who was an ally of Caesar, at the Battle of Carrhae (53 BC). The son of Crassus was in the Caesarian party. Thus, they thought that if the Caesarians won, they would want to avenge the death of Crassus. Justin also wrote that they had already sent assistance to Cassius and Brutus, which is in contrast with Cassius Dio‚Äôs account. Appian thought that it was the actions of Mark Antony which caused this Parthian invasion. When Antony fell in love with Cleopatra, he lost his interest in public affairs and did Cleopatra‚Äôs bidding.Mark Antony had Arsinoe, Cleopatra‚Äôs sister and a potential rival for the Egyptian throne, murdered, he had Serapion, Cleopatra's perfect in Cyprus, and a man who claimed to be her brother handed over to her by the townsfolk of Tyre and the Arcadians respectively After Caesar‚Äôs death on 44 BC there was civil strife in Syria and local tyrants took over the Syrian cities with the help of the Parthians. Antony expelled these tyrants, who took refuge in Parthia. He then imposed heavy tributes. He sent a cavalry force to plunder Palmyra, a rich city, but this was foiled by the townsfolk. He garrisoned Syria. This was the mistreatment Cassius Dio referred to. After this Antony went to Egypt to join Cleopatra.Appian, The Civil Wars, 5.9-10 Pompeian-Parthian invasion of 40BC Cassius Dio gave the details of Labienus‚Äôs campaign. He invaded Phoenicia and attacked Apamea, but he was repulsed. However, he won over all the Roman garrisons in Phoenicia without resistance because they were soldiers who had fought with Cassius and Brutus and were sent there when Mark Antony incorporated them in his forces. They knew Labienus. Lucius Decidius Saxa, who had been put in command in Syria by Antony, was the only one who did not defect. He fled. Labienus pursued him and defeated him and his few followers. Saxa fled to Antioch. The townsfolk of Apamea surrendered because they thought that Saxa was dead. Labienus forced Antioch to surrender and Saxa fled to Cilicia. Labienus caught up with him, captured him and executed him. Meanwhile, Pacorus subjugated Syria, except for Tyre, whose townsfolk supported the Roman soldiers who fled there. Pacorus did not have a fleet and could not seize the city. He moved on to Judea, invaded it, deposed Hyrcanus II and installed, Antigonus II Mattathias his nephew and foe.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 48.25.2-4-24.1-2 Josephus gave a detailed account of events in Judea when the Parthians invaded it.Josephus, The Jewish War, 1.13-15.309 Jewish Antiquities, 14.330-14 Meanwhile, Labienus occupied Cilicia and obtained the allegiance of the cities on the southern coast of Anatolia except for three cities in Caria: Stratonicea, Mylasa and Alabanda. The latter two cities had accepted garrisons from him, but then murdered them and rebelled. Labienus seized Alabanda and punished its people. He destroyed Mylasa after it had been abandoned. He besieged Stratonicea for a long time but did not manage to capture it. He styled himself as Parthicus (conqueror of the Parthians), thereby taking a ‚Äútitle from those whom he was leading against the Romans, as if it were the Parthians and not his fellow-citizens that he was defeating.‚Äù Cassius Dio, Roman History, 48.26.3-5 Plutarch wrote that Mark Antony was slow to respond to Labienus's invasions because he was caught up with the charms of Cleopatra in Egypt and a luxurious lifestyle, feasting, playing sports and engaging in other youthful pursuits. He was surprised by reports that his wife Fulvia had started a war with Octavian in Italy (the Perusine War, 41-40 BC) and that Labienus \\"was subduing Asia from the Euphrates and Syria as far as Lydia and Ionia.\\" Plutarch, The Live of Antony, 29-30.1 Cassius Dio, instead, wrote that Antony kept himself informed. However, he failed to take defensive measures, because now that he was in power he did not pay enough attention to his duties and enjoyed the life of luxury of the Egyptians ‚Äúuntil he was entirely demoralised.‚Äù When he was forced to take action, he sailed to Tyre to help Tyre. However, when he saw that Syria had already been occupied, he abandoned it. He sailed along the coast all the way to Greece and then to Italy to support Fulvia in her war against Octavian. He seized Sipontum and besieged Brundisium. When Fulvia died, the hostilities were terminated and there was reconciliation. Antony and Octavian signed the Treaty of Brundisium in September 40 BC.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 48.27-30.1Stories of Antiquity: Treaties of Brundisium & Tarentum Mark Antony returned to Greece. He sent Publius Ventidius Bassus to Asia against the Parthians and Labienus.Appian, The Civil Wars, 5.65 When Ventidius came upon Labienus, he was frightened by its suddenness. He was without the Parthians and had only troops which had been levied locally. Ventidius pushed him out of the Roman province of Asia and pursued him into Syria with his lightest troops. He caught up with him near the Taurus Mountains. The two forces stayed encamped for several days. Ventidius was waiting for his heavy-armed troops and Labienus was waiting for the Parthians. Both arrived at the same time. Ventidius was worried about the large enemy cavalry and remained in his camp on a hill. The latter, confident in the strength of their numbers, rode up the hill at dawn without waiting for Labienus‚Äô forces to join them. Ventidius did not respond and the cavalry made a charge up the slope. When they were some way up the Romans attacked and pushed the enemy downhill. Many were killed in combat and a larger number was trampled over by those who were retreating while they were still going up the hill. The survivors fled without joining Labienus, and Ventidius pursued them up to their camp. Labienus had got there and prepared to offer battle. However, his soldiers were dejected because of the flight of the Parthians. Labienus gave up and tried to withdraw. Ventidius had learned about this from deserters and prepared some ambushes. The enemy was defeated and Labienus escaped. He spent some time in Cilicia in disguise. However, he was found out and arrested. Ventidius took charge of Cilicia and sent a cavalry force to Amanus, a mountain between Cilicia and Syria. It was nearly routed by Pharnapates, a lieutenant of Pacorus in charge of the garrison at the pass. Ventidius showed up unexpectedly, defeated the enemy and killed Pharnapates. The Parthians abandoned Syria and Ventidius seized it without a fight. He occupied Judea and left it after a frightened Antigonous fled.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 48.39-41 For the actions of Ventidius and his lieutenant, Silo, in Judea see Josephus.Josephus, The Jewish War, 1.15.288-16-317 Jewish antiquities 14.15-394-434 According to Florus, the battle was fought between the rivers Euphrates and Orontes, and the defeated force numbered more than 20,000. Ventidius used the stratagem of pretending to panic to get the enemy to come close to prevent them from using their arrows as they would not have room to shoot. Pacorus died in the battle. This was a compensation for the disaster of Crassus at the Battle of Carrhae. His head was carried around the cities which had revolted. Syria was recovered without a fight.Florus, Epitome of Roman History, 2.19.3-7 Festus wrote that the battle was fought on Mount Caper. Both Labienus and Pacorus died in that battle. The latter died on the same day in which Crassus had been defeated and this avenged his death. Ventidius celebrated a triumph over the Persians. Velleius Paterculus, too, wrote that Labienus and Pacorus died in the battle.Velleius Paterculus, Roman History , 2.78 Frontinus, like Florus, thought that Ventidius feigned fear to lure the Parthians into an unfavourable situation and then attacked them by surprise. The Parthians refused to follow Labienus and left the province. Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.5.36 In the Periochae, with his victory, Ventidius drove the Parthians out of Syria after Labienus had been killed.The Periochae of Livy, 127 According to Plutarch, Labienus died in the battle, and so did Pharnapates, the most capable general of Orodes II. Mark Antony received the news of the victory while he was wintering in Athens.Plutarch, The Life of Antony, 33.4 According to Justin, Ventidius routed the Parthian army in the absence of Pacorus. Justin, too, wrote that Ventidius pretended to be afraid. He put the Parthians to flight with part of his army. Pacorus thought that the fugitive had drawn all the Romans in their pursuit and that their camp was unguarded. He attacked it, but was defeated by the rest of the Roman troops. Pacorus died. This was the biggest defeat suffered by the Parthians in any war.

For extended periods the medieval commanders of Viborg castle (chatelains, castellans), on the border with republic of Novgorod, did in practice function as margraves, collecting the crown's incomes from the fief in their own name and being entitled to keep them all to use for the defense of the realm's eastern border. They enjoyed more independence than the kingdom's other castellans, \\"burgraves\\". However the fief of Viborg castle and its county, was not formally hereditary, though almost all appointees were from certain families, related to the Bonde-B√•√•t- Haak family that also between the 1350s and 1390s held the Swedish titular version of the earldom of Orkney. Organization of that new territory for the Swedish realm took place between the 1290s and 1330s. The conquered Kexholm was lost, and Neva river's Landskrona was destroyed catastrophically. There was much sporadic warring for decades after, until 1323. Viborg was however held, and the coast westwards. When the conquest became established, a special fief became formed. Gotland had strong trade relations with coastal Carelia. Novgorod succeeded maintaining its control of the Ladoga coast and Neva river. The independence and privileges of the county were founded by the Joninpoika brothers. Squire Peter Jonsson (later knighted) and his elder brother sir Sune Jonsson, Lord of Flishult, Royal Councillor, the lawspeaker of Tioh√§rad (in inland Sm√•land), together with their close relative Charles, bishop of Link√∂ping, allies of the new king Magnus IV of Sweden, in 1320 or 1321 purchased dominus Efflerus, the bailiff of the deposed king Birger of Sweden, out from Viborg castle. They committed to keep the castle and its revenues for bishop Charles until the purchase price be compensated. Their escutcheon depicted a boat, as is also depicted in arms of the so-called Bonde family and Snakenborg family and B√•√•t family and Puke family; and they were from an originally Sm√•landic family, some of them at that time using nickname Haak. Lord Peter was set up as the fief-holder, and the whole clan participated in consolidating the fief. They also brought numbers of their Sm√•landic peasants to start farms in the county. There are toponymic indications of an influx of Southern-Swedish immigrants having settled in vicinities of Viborg and on the coast west up to Kymi river. Peter and Sune recognized the new king and received important privileges, which effectively turned their holding of Viborg as an independent feudal fief, the start of a veritable margraviate. The position of this fiefed chatelain was \\"to defend the castle and the county, to administer them, with freedom to organize the internal affairs of the county as it pleased them, to bear the revenues and use as it pleased...\\" They also grabbed immense wealth for the family: Sune's son Erengisle, Earl of Orkney is a recorded owner of Kymmeneg√•rd manor in the Viborg province, on which spot the later town of Kotka became erected. Munken√§s, an immense domain in Vederlax, was owned first by Sten Turesson Bielke, Lord High Constable of Sweden, and then his son Sten Stensson, Lord of Engs√∂. All the Swedish-party negotiators of Treaty of N√∂teborg (1323), three years after the acquisition of Viborg, appear to be members of their extended family or representatives of bishop Charles' diocese and merchants of Gotland which was a part of that diocese. Its chatelains were generally from the most powerful families of the kingdom. They enjoyed large administrative powers and a good distance from the capital. Those realities made them practically independent rulers. The position of Viborg's lord became effectively independent. As such, it was desired by many powerful magnates. In the 1350s it was held by earl Erengisle's brother-in-law, the mighty King-Maker Nicholas Turesson, Lord of Kr√•kerum of the Bielke. He personally owned Kaukj√§rvi domain in the Karelian isthmus near Viborg. They organized defences, constant local guarding, provisions of food and equipment, kept fortress in shape, kept mercenaries and paid military. The direct-line Jonsson family ended in 1392 at the death of Earl Erengisle. However, the margraviate was, almost without exception, held by descendants (or husbands of such) of their extended family until its very end, over two centuries. Early margraves of Viborg created a petty nobility, knapadel, around their strategic points. More capable peasants with some leader role in local community, were given tax exemption against guard duties of local strongholds, those somewhat primitive \\"linnavuori\\" fortresses. Cavalry service was not required from them for the fr√§lse tax exemption. Petty nobility of Veckelax is particularly noted in literature for as having been an example of such petty nobility. Later margraves, such as Krister Nilsson and Charles Knutsson, declined to accept fully the nobility of such families of the petty nobility. Apparently the main reason why the chatelain of the Viborg county succeeded in keeping such an independent position compared to other castles and their holders, was Viborg's extraordinary position as the easternmost outpost and the stronghold of the Swedish realm against eastern neighboring power, their attacks and desires to annex more land. Revenues from this county were needed for the defense of eastern border, which usually was understood in the government of the kingdom - were eastern defense not granted sufficient resources, taxes from more western areas would possibly also have been lost to enemy. These fiefholders were also responsible for holding the northern border. In the 1470s, they established another castle, Olofsborg, over 100 km north of Viborg. All the Middle Ages, that fortress was kept under the command of Viborg. Important personages who held Viipuri county as their fief, were Bo Jonsson Grip, Krister Nilsson Vasa (1417‚Äì42), Charles Knutsson Bonde (1442‚Äì48, the future king), Erik Axelsson Tott (1457‚Äì81), Knut Posse (1495‚Äì97), Sten Sture the Elder (particularly 1497-99 when personally in residence, between his regencies), Eric Bielke and count John of Hoya. Particularly in the 1440s and in the late 15th century, the fortresses of the Viborg castle were further enlarged and built. In 1534, king Gustav I of Sweden abolished the independent fief by deposing and exiling his brother-in- law John, Count of Hoya. Lord Nils Grabbe took Viborg castle by force on behalf of the king and became its royal governor, without gaining feudal privileges held by earlier holders of the castle.  List of fiefholders of the Viborg castle  This is to list all those medieval and 16th century lords who held Viipuri castle and its fief, as fiefed chatelains, in the independent way (\\"margrave\\") and not simply as governors or bailiffs. The list is incomplete, due to the scarcity of historical sources and thus gaps. In 1320, lord Peter Jonsson (Haak) purchased the castle and its dominions from the bailiff Efflerus set there by the deposed king Birger. * 1320 - 1338 (or later) Peter Jonsson (and in c 1336 he was governor of all Finland) * 1340 Dan Niklasson * c 1348 Gerhard Skytte * 1357 - 1364 Nils Turesson Bielke, kingdom's Lord High Justiciar, son-in-law of Peter Jonsson's brother * 1360s: Nils' heirs, as pawn. * 1370 King Albrekt * 1371 - 1386 Bo Jonsson Grip (all Finland), Lord High Justiciar * 1386 - 1399 Karl, Charles Ulvsson, Lord of Tofta, kingdom's Lord High Constable, stepson of a niece of Peter Jonsson * 1403 - 1417 Tord Bonde, Lord High Constable, distant cousin of Peter Jonsson * 1417 - 1442 Kristiern, Krister Nilsson Vaasa, Lord High Justiciar, brother-in- law of Tord Bonde * 1440 - 1448 Karl, Charles Knutsson, Lord of Fogelvik (b. 1408 - d. 1470), Lord High Constable, grandson of Charles Ulvsson and of Tord Bonde, became in 1448 king * 1457 - 1481 Erik Akselsson Tott (b. c.1420 - d. 1487), great-grandson of Tord Bonde, son of a first cousin of Charles Knutsson * 1481 Lars, Laurens Axelsen Thott, brother of previous * 1483 Ivar, Iver Axelsen Thott, Overlord of Gotland, brother of previous, son-in-law of Charles Knutsson * 1483 - 1495 Sten Sture the Elder, Kingdom's Regent, nephew of Charles Knutsson, great-grandson of Charles Ulvsson, and great-great-great- grandnephew of Nils Turesson  his deputy: Nils Eriksson Gyllenstierna, grandson of Charles Knutsson * 1495 - 1496 Knut, Knut Posse (d. 1500) * 1497 - 1501 again Sten Sture the Elder (b. 1440 - d. 1503), between his terms as Regent of Sweden * 1499 - May 1511 Erik Turesson Bielke (d. 1511), great- great-grandnephew of Nils Turesson * 1511 - 1513 Gunilla Johansdotter Bese, widow of Eric Bielke, her predecessor * 1513 - 1520 Tony Eriksson Tott, son- in-law of the two previous, great-nephew of Erik Akselsson, Laurens and Ivar of Gotland * 1525 - 1534 Johan, Count of Hoya and Bruchhausen (d. 1535), son- in-law of Sten Sture's nephew, brother-in-law of the reigning king Gustav I.

A severable contract generally must contain a \\"severability clause\\" that allows certain clauses and aspects of the contract to be \\"severed\\" without affecting the validity of the rest of the contract. For example, if Mr. X purchases a computer, a scanner, a printer and a desk from a retailer, and the retailer cannot deliver the printer, the other parts of the contract (the computer, the scanner and the desk) are still valid and must be honored. The above example, however, is incomplete. If Mr. X purchases a computer, scanner, printer and desk as part of a package, with the explicit agreement that all parts must be delivered together, the failure to deliver the printer may be material breach of the entire contract.

For the past 50 years, the city name is Surandai. Polygar rule and the revolts As the Dalavay Mudali, the governor of Tirunelveli, became increasingly independent of Madurai during the time of troubles that began in 1732, some of the Marava polygars of the province openly defied the Dalavay's authority and stopped paying tribute. Polygar Kattari Velladurai was the leader of the defiant polygars from Vadagarai, Nerkattumseval ruled by Puli Thevar and Sivagiri. Surandai was one of the palayams that joined Puli Thevar‚Äôs coalition in 1754‚Äì1762 but abandoned the cause before the polygars‚Äô final defeat in 1762. When Kollamkondan again rebelled in 1764, following the execution of Yusuf Khan for having betrayed the nawab, Surandai was quick to join. Victories over the Anglo-Nawabi forces helped the revolt spread to other polygars. At the end of the First Polygar War in 1799, the polygar of Surandai surrendered one fort and 61 armed men to Major J. Bannerman. Zamindari The Palaiyam survived into the 19th century as a zamindari; at the time of the permanent settlement of 1802, Polygar Sulava Tevar held seven villages.

CDRCU was led by Michael McCreery, the son of General Sir Richard McCreery. CDRCU was sympathetic towards the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania, with CDRCU members attending May Day celebrations in Tirana in May 1964. The group began publishing Vanguard in 1963.John Moorhouse, A Historical Glossary of British Marxism (Pauper's Press, 1987) History CDRCU reached the height of its activity from February 1964 to February 1965, during which CDRCU cells were established in London, the Thames Valley, Scotland, West Yorkshire, Manchester and Cardiff, and public meetings were arranged. CDRCU had split with other CPGB members, some of them based around the Forum publication, who wanted to remain inside the CPGB to conduct the anti-revisionist struggle. In October 1964, the CDRCU stood a candidate in Huyton in the general election, gaining 899 votes.Buchanan, Tom. East Wind: China and the British Left, 1925-1976, Oxford: 2012, p201 After McCreery died (at the age of only 36) from cancer in 1965 in New Zealand, the activity of the group declined sharply. Most of the members of CDRCU regrouped into the Action Centre for Marxist-Leninist Unity,William B. Bland - Obituary which evolved into the Marxist-Leninist Organisation of Britain. A small number formed the Finsbury Communist Association.https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.firstwave/finsbury-open- letter.htmhttps://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.firstwave/cdr-kenna.htm Others later formed the Workers' Party of Scotland and the London Workers' Committee. In 1966 the London Workers' Committee split, becoming the Working People's Party of England. Some of the Irish members of the CDRCU later joined the Irish Communist Group in 1965. When the latter organisation split, they went on to form the Irish Communist Organisation.David Widgery, The Left in Britain (1976) p.489.

It is a panel made of plywood, spanned canvas or similar material, which is placed vertically, diagonally across the playing table, with a small door in the center and a slit beneath it. The door is closed during the bidding stage, and the players place their calls using bidding cards on a movable tray, which slides under the door. After the opening lead, the door is opened, but its size allows the players only to see the hands and cards played from the opposite side of the screen, not their partner's face. Screens are normally used on high-level competitions, such as World Bridge Olympiads, national teams championships and similar. They are always accompanied with bidding boxes and a tray for moving the bids across. Screens were first introduced in Bermuda Bowl competition in 1975, at the home venue in Bermuda; however, they didn't prevent the foot-tapping scandal involving two Italian players.Inside the Bermuda Bowl, John Swanson, ISBN B0006RI6XA Following that event, screens used in high-level events extend under the table to the floor forming a barrier running diagonally between two table legs. Rationale The screen separates partners view of each other Screen door in the open position Full height screens in use at a tournament Laws of Duplicate Contract Bridge state that \\"Players are authorized to base their calls and plays on information from legal calls and plays and from mannerisms of opponents. To base a call or play on other extraneous information may be an infraction of law.\\".Laws of Duplicate Contract Bridge ‚Äì Chapter 4 (Irregularities) Also, \\"After a player makes available to his partner extraneous information that may suggest a call or play, as by means of a remark, a question, a reply to a question, or by unmistakable hesitation, unwonted speed, special emphasis, tone, gesture, movement, mannerism or the like, the partner may not choose from among logical alternative actions one that could demonstrably have been suggested over another by the extraneous information.\\" In other words, if a player receives such an unauthorized information from the partner (hesitation being the most frequent source), he may not act according to its (perceived) consequences (provided it is not an obvious thing to do, but \\"obvious\\" has rather high standard according to the laws). The most frequent means for transmitting the unauthorized information are: *Hesitation (break in tempo) during bidding and play. Players are supposed to make their bids and plays in a tempo as even as possible; an experienced player will often make a slight pause even when there is no problem at all, in order to maintain the same tempo if a problem occurs. However, when a player has a bidding or play problem, his hesitation often tells much about his holding. For example, a long contemplation over a double of opponents' contract indicates uncertainty whether the contract would be beaten, and \\"invites\\" the partner to bid on (\\"pull the double\\") without defensive values; a hesitation which card to play when the declarer plays towards dummy's king suggests possession of an ace, etc. *Questions asked by the partner to the opponents. The players are entitled to know the meanings of opponents' bids, and they may ask them whenever it's their turn to bid or play. However, if a player has a habit to skip the question with a worthless hand and pass, and asks with some values (and passes if he doesn't like opponents' reply), his partner can draw conclusions about his holding. *Questions asked by the opponents to the partner. If opponents ask the partner about the meaning of a bid or play, his answer may reveal a previous misunderstanding in the partnership. Also, the partner's alert of a bid he shouldn't have alerted, and vice versa, may indicate that someone has forgotten the agreement. *Partner's gestures and facial expressions can be telling, even if inadvertent. Outright cheating by transmitting information by gestures, finger play, pencil play and similar methods agreed in advance is strictly prohibited, and violators can be banned from duplicate play for several years or forever. Screens are supposed to remove all issues except changes in tempo altogether: partners don't see each other, and since the screenmates are required to communicate only by writing, the partner cannot hear the (mis)explanation. Also, each player alerts both his own and his partner's bids and explains the meaning only to his screenmate, so even if a misunderstanding occurs, the partners will not become aware of it. As for the hesitation, the players supposedly cannot tell who of the players from the opposite screen side hesitated (or whether the time was spent in writing the explanation), even if the tempo break occurs. In practice, it is not a panacea‚Äîfor example, after two players produce a long constructive slam- seeking auction with opponents passing throughout, a break in tempo likely indicates partner's problem and not his screenmate's. However, players are encouraged to vary the tempo in which the tray is passed across Laws of Duplicate Contract Bridge: Appendix related to bidding box and screen procedures (e.g. to withhold it for a while even without reason) in order to reduce the effects of hesitation. In addition, the presence of the screen affects some of the rules of other irregularities. Namely, an illegal, inadmissible or inadvertent (the last subject to Director's appraisal) call may be replaced without penalty as long as the tray wasn't passed to the opposite side. Also, a call out of turn can be withdrawn without penalty if the tray did not change sides.World Bridge Federation General Conditions of Contest Procedure The procedure of bidding and play with screens is as follows: The screen is placed diagonally across the table in such fashion that North and East, South and West are screenmates. The board is placed in the middle of a movable tray. The screen is closed so that the bidding tray can just pass under it. It is North's responsibility to place the board on, and to remove the board from the bidding tray. It is West's responsibility to adjust the screen aperture; it is closed (and remains so during the whole of the auction period) so that the bidding tray can just pass under it. The players remove the cards from the board. During bidding, calls are made with the cards from the bidding box. The player places the selected call in the bidding tray, which will be visible only on the player's side of the screen. After two players on the same side of the screen have made their calls, North or South (as the case may be) slides the bidding tray under the centre of the screen so as to be visible only to the players on the other side. They in turn make their calls in like manner and the bidding tray is slid back again. This procedure is continued until the auction is completed. After a legal opening lead is faced, the screen aperture is opened sufficiently so that all players may see the dummy and the cards played to each trick. A player may at any time during the auction, by written question only, ask for an explanation of an opponent's call; the screen-mate must respond in writing. Any questions during the play period must be made with the screen aperture closed; again, both question and answer must be in writing. The screen aperture is opened after the response has been made. Failure to observe the requirements for written questions and responses constitutes an offence subject to penalty. The Directors have been instructed to apply this condition strictly. All communication through the screen as to meanings and explanations is expressly forbidden until the end of the play. Drawbacks * One of major complaints of players to the screen procedure is that it reduces the social dimension of the game, reducing all communication to the card play. However, that is their very purpose. * Screen procedure slows down the game. The standard tempo under screens is 8.5 minutes per game, instead of standard 7.5 minutes. * They are difficult to set up, and can be expensive to obtain for a large number of tables. They are usually reserved for team and trial events, and even on World Bridge Olympiads on pairs championships they are used only in final rounds.

In Suratgarh, Male literacy is around 83.19% while female literacy rate is 67.39%. Media Akashwani Suratgarh broadcasts on 918 kHz with a 300 kW radio transmitter. It has been given the name \\"Cotton city channel\\". This channel can regularly also be listened in Central Europe around 30 minutes before local sunset till end of broadcast at 17:41 UTC and is the best heard Akashvani station in Central Europe broadcasting on medium wave. History Suratgarh was a significant arena of historical incidences in the ancient past. The city was once called Sodal. Around 3000 BC Suratgarh is believed to have been a lush, green place due to the presence of two big rivers, Sarasvati and Drishadvati. Present sand possessed various botanical and zoological species within the basins of chaste Sarasvati and Drishvati. The emergence of Kalibangan and Barod civilizations were facilitated by the geographical and environmental complements of the Sarasvati, and Suratgarh was a noteworthy testimony of this. The traces of ancient civilization near Rangmahal, Manaksaar and Amarpura show the historical significance of Suratgarh where Sarasvati civilization has receded after 1500 years of stability. Suratgarh developed greatly under the rule of Maharaja Ganga Singh who built a hunting lodge at Suratgarh and ensured the connectivity of Suratgarh to train service. Hanumangarh and Bikaner came under the Suratgarh District when the district was established. Establishment of the Ganges canal in 1927 helped Suratgarh develop; it became a city after partition when various refugees from Pakistan came in and started settling there. Suratgarh Central State Farm was established in 1956, followed with the establishment of the Indira Gandhi Canal project and Central Animal Reproduction Farm in the 1960s. Meanwhile, an air and military base station, Akashvani and various offices had been established. Suratgarh Thermal Power Station started working from 3 November 1998 and this laid down one more milestone in the progress of Suratgarh city. It has a thermal power plant of 1500 MW and a PLF of 93%, which has won an award for one of the best-operated plants in India. The industry experienced acute growth with the construction of the thermal power plant and its residential buildings. Since then the industry has been growing quickly. With the reducing demands as a result of completion of the thermal power plant project, bricks from Suratgarh are now supplied to various parts of Rajasthan especially to the districts of Churu and Jhunjhunu.  Governance  Citywide administration is coordinated by the Nagar Palika Suratgarh. Here is an SDM court, an ADM, ACJM, MJM and ADJ court. There is an emergency security system to secure the city.  Weather  Since Suratgarh lies within the fringes of the Thar Desert, the region has a hot desert climate with extremely hot summers and cool winters. The hottest months of the year are from April to October where the maximum temperatures remain above 118¬∞F (48¬∞C) and the average temperatures for the day remains above 95¬∞F (35¬∞C). On some days in the months of May, Jun and Jul the maximum temperatures regularly cross 122¬∞F (50¬∞C). Humidity remains below 50% throughout the year and during the peak of summer and winter months the humidity regularly falls below 20%. Due to its desert climate rainfall is sparse and happens during the two Monsoon seasons and the average rainfall across the year is less than 10 inches (25 cm). During the summer months dry winds blowing across the desert whip up dust storms which are common in the evening hours. Winters are generally mild with temperatures averaging around 55¬∞F with a few days in December and January with temperatures falling as low as 33¬∞F (1¬∞C). Yearly average UV index for the region is above 7 with the summer months approaching 10 throughout the day.

Further development is provided by the presence of newly constructed cement production factories named as Shree Cement Ltd & Bangur cement unit that use ash from the thermal power plant, produce PPC, OPC & premium cement .Much of the local population depends on agricultural activities for their household income.  Transport  Suratgarh Junction is on the Jodhpur-Bathinda line. Distance from surrounding cities: Bikaner ‚àí 174 km, Ganganagar ‚àí 70 km, Hanumangarh ‚àí 52 km The city is well connected with other cities by train and road networks. National Highway number 62 and a mega highway pass through the city.  Culture  City Suratgarh city is culturally diverse. Most of the people from the main city are either employed by the government or local merchants. The city has a traditional Bagri cultural element, but, not being far from Punjab and Punjabi speaking areas of western Haryana, there is also a rich influence of Punjabi culture. The presence of two major military garrisons of Indian Air Force and Indian Army and the Super Thermal Power plant has resulted in the area being home to multiple cultures from all across India and Nepal. Due to security concerns cultural interactions between the civilian local residents and the military are extremely limited to senior administration officials.  Sports  There is an infrastructure for the practice of sports such as cricket, football, badminton, and basketball. The government college sports ground located at NH 62 highway provides a good platform for sport activities.

Macclesfield Forest can be seen on the horizon. The Cat and Fiddle is a road in England between Buxton, Derbyshire, and Macclesfield, Cheshire, named after the Cat and Fiddle Inn public house at its summit. Formed by parts of the A537, A54 and A53, it is famous for its scenic views across the Greater Manchester conurbation, the Peak District National Park and the Cheshire Plain, and for its many bends. It is extremely popular with motorcyclists, and is often classed as the most dangerous road in the UK. Route The road takes its name from the Cat and Fiddle Inn which is at an elevation of .[https://latitude.to/articles-by-country/gb/united-kingdom/97120/cat-and- fiddle-inn Latitude and longitude of Cat and Fiddle Inn] The road can be considered to start in Buxton at the junction of the A53 and A5004 Long Hill road just north of the Buxton Opera House. It follows the A53 through the western outskirts of Buxton until a right turn onto the A54 at Ladmanlow. It then climbs in a series of sharp bends onto the flat moorland of Goyt's Moss, where it runs as the A537 in a fairly straight line until reaching the Inn (which closed in late 2016). From the inn property, it descends to Macclesfield via a continuous series of sharp and often blind, bends. Usage It is one of only two roads into Macclesfield from the east and thus carries long-distance as well as local traffic, including heavy goods vehicles. It also carries tourist traffic into the Peak District National Park, including cyclists and walkers. It is part of the \\"Cat and Fiddle ‚Äì Long Hill ‚Äì Highwayman\\" triangle, which is particularly attractive to motorcyclists because of the frequency and severity of the bends. Given this mixture of usage, the number and sharpness of the bends and the frequent straying livestock on the road, a great deal of caution is needed. Bad winter weather can make the road even more hazardous. The Cat and Fiddle Road was used as part of the route of the third stage of the 2016 Tour of Britain from Congleton to Tatton Park, forming the longest and highest climb of that year's race. Road safety initiatives A 2016 report indicates that between 2007 and 2011, there were 44 serious or fatal crashes on the 7.5 mile stretch. Between 2002 and 2006, there were 35. The report states that the safety issue is caused by \\"severe bends, steep falls from the carriageway and edged by dry- stone walls for almost the entirety of the road\\".A537 Road (Cat and Fiddle) As a result, the speed limit on the section between Macclesfield and the Cat and Fiddle Inn was reduced to from the national limit. The road is regularly patrolled by unmarked police cars and motorcycles and a mobile speed camera van is used most weekends during the summer. A police aircraft is often used in conjunction with these to enforce the speed limit. The road was named as the UK's most dangerous in a 2008 survey. The single-carriageway route was the location of 21 fatal and serious crashes and was rated in the EuroRAP report as Black, the highest risk rating. This was in spite of a number of countermeasures installed by the road authority, including motorcycle-friendly barriers. The Foundation attributed this high number of accidents to road user behaviour; indeed, when motorcycle-related collisions are removed from the results the road became one of the safest in the country. Cheshire County Council also pointed the finger at motorcyclists' behaviour: Having already spent ¬£500,000 on a number of safety measures (including reducing the speed limit, installing high-friction surfacing, barriers and signs, widening the carriageway and using mobile speed cameras), in January 2009 it was revealed that Cheshire Council, on behalf of Cheshire Safer Roads Partnership and Derbyshire Partnership for Road Safety, intended to spend a further ¬£1.2 million on installing average-speed cameras along this road. Installation of these cameras began in February 2010. However, the initial operation of the cameras did not go smoothly, because along the full route of the cameras' operation there are a number of shortcuts which have the full national speed (60 mph) and decrease the overall distance of the route. These two factors, when combined, can give inaccurate readings from the speed cameras. The average-speed camera scheme is a joint initiative between the Cheshire Safer Roads Partnership (including Cheshire East Council), Lee Murphy, Cheshire Safer Roads Partnership manager, said: \\"Major resources have been committed to the Cat and Fiddle road since 2000, including reducing the speed limit, high- friction surfacing, high-visibility warning signs, red warnings painted on the road, motorcycle-friendly safety barriers, enforcement signs, carriageway widening, mobile safety cameras and police operations. Even without police costs, we estimate that more than ¬£500,000 has been spent on the road in Cheshire alone. Despite all this work, casualties remain high.\\" Of the 264 casualties on the road since 2001, approximately 70% of those killed or seriously injured were motorcyclists, the main causes being poor cornering/manoeuvring, exceeding the speed limit and failing to judge another vehicle‚Äôs speed/distance. \\"The information and statistics show that it is riding behaviour not the road condition that causes the majority of collisions. We don‚Äôt have a problem with other road users not seeing bikes, because the majority of collisions are single vehicles,\\" added Murphy. The Cat and Fiddle again topped the list in the 2010 report, which claimed that fatalities on the road rose from 15 in the three years to 2005 to 34 between 2006 and 2008. However, following the introduction of further safety measures including improved road barriers, a 50mph speed limit and the installation of average speed cameras, the road dropped out of the Foundation's top ten list in 2015.

He wanted to clean up the government‚Äôs public contracts racket that benefited Cosa Nostra, passing a law enforcing the same building standards used in the rest of Italy, thereby making the Mafia's building schemes illegal.Mob Rule - Fighting the Mafia and Renewing Sicilian Culture - Review, National Review, October 1, 2001 Soon, Mattarella became isolated. The inspector he had asked to conduct an investigation into the public contracts in Palermo, Raimondo Mignosi, recalled the air of intimidation at the time: ‚ÄúI told him to be careful because I ran the risk of ending up in a cement block, at which he replied, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs not true, I‚Äôll end up in the cement.‚Äô To break the tension, we jokingly agreed that we would both end up in cement blocks side by side.‚ÄùStille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 83 Political involvement in murder The Mafia used its contacts with forthcoming Sicilian DC-politicians such as Salvo Lima and the Salvo cousins to complain to former prime minister Giulio Andreotti about the behaviour of Mattarella, according to Mafia turncoat (pentito) Francesco Marino Mannoia.The Andreotti Affair: Supergrasses target Andreotti, The Independent, April 16, 1993 Andreotti contacted Mafia boss Stefano Bontade to try to prevent the Mafia from killing Piersanti Mattarella. Bontade and other Mafiosi felt betrayed by Mattarella, who used to be responsive to their interests (his father Bernardo Mattarella was rumoured to be associated with the Mafia).Dickie, Cosa Nostra, p. 423-24 Andreotti‚Äôs attempt failed. After the murder of Mattarella, Andreotti again contacted Bontade and Salvatore Inzerillo to try to straighten things out. Andreotti and Lima allegedly arrived at the meeting in a bullet-proof Alfa Romeo, belonging to the Salvo cousins. He had come to protest the killing. However, according to Marino Mannoia, Bontade told Andreotti: \\"We are in charge in Sicily and, unless you want the whole DC cancelled out, you do as we say.\\"Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 391 When Andreotti‚Äôs aide Franco Evangelisti asked Lima about what had happened, Lima replied: ‚ÄúWhen agreements are struck, they have to be kept‚Äù. Trials According to Marino Mannoia the killers of Mattarella were Salvatore Federico, Francesco Dav√¨, Santo Inzerillo and Antonio Rotolo, while the principals were on the Sicilian Mafia Commission, at the time ‚Äì Bontade and Inzerillo, as well as Michele Greco, Salvatore Riina, Bernardo Provenzano, Antonino Geraci, Francesco Madonia, Pippo Cal√≤, Bernardo Brusca. \\"I killer erano mafiosi e non neri\\", Corriere della Sera, April 5, 1995 On 12 April 1995, they were sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder. The Mattarella killing was also part of the trial against Andreotti for collusion with the Mafia. The court established that Andreotti had indeed had strong ties to the Mafia until 1980, and had used them to further his political career to such an extent as to be considered a component of the Mafia itself. The judges decided to uphold Andreotti's original acquittal on grounds of expiration of statutory terms because he had severed relations with the Mafia from 1980. It attributed the turnaround to Mattarella's murder.'Kiss of honour' between Andreotti and Mafia head never happened, say judges, The Independent, July 26, 2003 Legacy According to Leoluca Orlando, former mayor of Palermo for the DC and Antimafia activist, who had been a legal adviser to Mattarella, the rumours about his father and his party‚Äôs experiences with the Mafia were probably responsible for Piersanti‚Äôs aspiration to clean the Christian Democrat party of any such connections.Orlando, Fighting the Mafia and Renewing Sicilian Culture, p. 47 The Italian national Anti-mafia Prosecutor, Piero Grasso, said that Mattarella was killed because \\"he was trying to accomplish a new political and administrative project, a true revolution, which, through a deep change in the management of the Region, aimed at breaking well established relations between bureaucracy, politics, business and the mafia. His policy of radical moralization of public life, based on the idea that Sicily needed to present itself with 'the papers in order', had upset the system of public procurement, with stunning moves, never seen before in the Island\\".Grasso, Per non morire di mafia, p. 5. Judge Giancarlo Caselli, Chief Prosecutor in Palermo for many years, described Mattarella as \\"a honest and courageous Christian democrat, killed just because he was honest and courageous\\". 'Cosi' si aiuta un imputato che e' accusato di mafia', La Repubblica, August 12, 1997 His younger brother, Sergio Mattarella, was elected as President of the Italian Republic in February 2015.

Shiner, usually donning a small dunce cap, started as a street mime, first in Colorado, and later in France and Germany. He managed to get multiple gigs with various circuses, including performances with the German Circus Roncalli and the Swiss National Circus (Circus Knie). In between he toured performing a dual act with Ren√© Bazinet. From 1990 he was featured in Cirque du Soleil's production Nouvelle Exp√©rience, touring for 19 months through Canada and the USA and playing for another year in Las Vegas. With his antics, including stepping through, on and over much of the crowd and the staging of a mock silent-movie melodrama with four members of the audience, he may be the best-remembered of the Cirque's clowns. In 1995, he also starred in Man of the House.Interview with Shiner, cirquedusoleil.com; accessed August 28, 2017. The production was filmed for HBO and Shiner's popularity rendered him film roles as a clown in Lorenzo's Oil and as straight man to Bill Irwin in Sam Shepard's Silent Tongue. He and Irwin then created the two-man, wordless show Fool Moon, featuring music by the Red Clay Ramblers, which had also performed in Silent Tongue. This \\"evening of inspired lunacy\\" ran from 1992-99, including three separate runs at Broadway. The show won a special Tony for \\"Live Theatrical Presentation\\" in 1999, a Drama Desk Award for Unique Theatrical Experience, and an Outer Critics Circle \\"Special Achievement\\" Award. In 2000, Shiner initiated the role of The Cat in the Hat, the host and guide of the Broadway stage musical Seussical. Later he toured Europe and Seattle with his shows David Shiner in the Round and Drop Everything. He made additional appearances on The Tonight Show, and is a guest director at the Wintergarden Theatre in Berlin and the Apollo Theatre in D√ºsseldorf.

In 2007, Shiner wrote and directed Cirque du Soleil's touring production Kooz√•, using such performers as Gordon White, Jason Berrent, Stephan Laundry, Michael Halvarson, Joshua Zehner and Christian Fitzherris for the original cast. Following Kooza, Shiner then wrote and directed Cirque's infamous Banana Shpeel which was one of the most unsuccessful shows the company had produced. It premiered in 2009 and was cancelled soon the following year due to the poor reception by audiences and critiques alike.\\"Cirque gives Banana Shpeel the hook\\" Globe and Mail.

It was first discovered in 1969 by a group of astronomers led by Eric Becklin, based upon infrared observations made with the Caltech Infrared Telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory. Its energy is emitted mostly at infrared wavelengths. At a wavelength of 5 Œºm, it was found to have the highest flux of any object outside the Solar System. Properties CW Leonis is believed to be in a late stage of its life, blowing off its own sooty atmosphere to form a white dwarf in a distant future. Based upon isotope ratios of magnesium, the initial mass of this star has been constrained to lie between 3‚Äì5 solar masses. The mass of the star's core, and the final mass of the star once it becomes a white dwarf, is about 0.7‚Äì0.9 solar masses. Its bolometric luminosity varies over the course of a 649-day pulsation cycle, ranging from a minimum of about 6,250 times the Sun's luminosity up to a peak of around 15,800 times. The overall output of the star is best represented by a luminosity of . The carbon-rich gaseous envelope surrounding this star is at least 69,000 years old and the star is losing about solar masses per year. The extended envelope contains at least 1.4 solar masses of material. Speckle observations from 1999 show a complex structure to this dust envelope, including partial arcs and unfinished shells. This clumpiness may be caused by a magnetic cycle in the star that is comparable to the solar cycle in the Sun and results in periodic increases in mass loss. Various chemical elements and about 50 molecules have been detected in the outflows from CW Leonis, among others nitrogen, oxygen and water, silicon and iron. One theory was that the star was once surrounded by comets which melted once the star started expanding, but water is now thought to form naturally in the atmospheres of all carbon stars. Distance If the distance to this star is assumed to be at the lower end of the estimate range, 120 pc, then the astrosphere surrounding the star spans a radius of about 84,000 AU. The star and its surrounding envelope are advancing at a velocity of more than 91 km/s through the surrounding interstellar medium. It is moving with a space velocity of [U, V, W] = [, , ] km s‚àí1. Companion Several papers have suggested that CW Leonis has a close binary companion. ALMA and astrometric measurements may show orbital motion. The astrometric measurements, combined with a model including the companion, provide a parallax measurement showing that CW Leonis is the closest carbon star to the Earth.

The Abbey of Fontenay is a former Cistercian abbey located in the commune of Marmagne, near Montbard, in the d√©partement of C√¥te-d'Or in France. It was founded by Saint Bernard of Clairvaux in 1118, and built in the Romanesque style. It is one of the oldest and most complete Cistercian abbeys in Europe, and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981. Of the original complex comprising church, dormitory, cloister, chapter house, caldarium, refectory, dovecote and forge, all remain intact except the refectory and are well maintained. The Abbey of Fontenay, along with other Cistercian abbeys, forms a connecting link between Romanesque and Gothic architectures. History Foundation of the order In the late 11th century during the heyday of the great church of Cluny III (a magnificent Benedictine monastery in Cluny, France), although Cluny had numerous followers, Saint Robert of Molesme, the subsequent founder of C√Æteaux Abbey,Terryl N. Kinder, Cistercian Europe (Cambridge: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2002), 27. led a strong reaction against it. Saint Robert thought that Cluny was against the actual Rule of Saint Benedict: ‚Äúto work is to pray‚Äù. As a result, Saint Robert, along with a group of monks who shared this belief, detached from Cluny. Saint Robert established the Order of Cistercians in Citeaux, France. The new order strictly observed the Rule of Saint Benedict. As part of this rule, monks had to be poor and live a simple life. In order not to be distracted from the religious life, Cistercians built self-sufficient monasteries in isolated areas and refused to use servants. Cistercian monasteries were independent. They differed from Cluny in that all houses were under the direct control of the abbot, and each Cistercian monastery needed to take care of its own. Each of them was most likely an independent individual society. Bernard of Clairvaux, an abbot and the primary builder of the reformed Cistercian order, shared the same faith with Saint Robert of Molesme. However, Bernard felt that C√Æteaux Abbey was not austere enough and did not completely reflect the Rule of Saint Benedict. Thus, in 1118 he founded the Abbey of Fontenay in a Burgundy valley with strictly implemented austerity. History of the abbey The Cistercian monks moved to Fontenay Abbey in 1130. Nine years later, the Bishop of Norwich fled to Fontenay to escape persecution, and helped finance the construction of the church with his wealth. The church was consecrated in 1147 by Pope Eugene III. By 1200 the monastic complex was complete and able to serve as many as 300 monks. In 1259, the devout King Louis exempted the Abbey of Fontenay from all taxes, and being in the King‚Äôs good graces, ten years later the abbey became a royal abbey. In 1359, the Abbey of Fontenay was pillaged by the armies of King Edward III of England during the Hundred Years' War. It suffered further damage during the Wars of Religion in late 16th century. In 1745, the refectory was destroyed. With the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789 all of the monks successively left the abbey due to dechristianisation during the revolution and in 1791, the site was turned into a paper mill, run by the Montgolfier brothers. In 1906 Edouard Aynard, an art-loving banker from Lyon, bought the abbey and commenced its restoration which was complete by 1911. Edouard's descendants continued to work on the abbey and it remains in the Aynard family to this day. In 1981 the abbey became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.‚ÄúFontenay Abbey,‚Äù last modified March 29, 2010, http://www.sacred- destinations.com/france/fontenay-abbey. Architecture The Virgin of Fontenay Background All Cistercians churches have the same model and are extremely similar to one another; for example, Graiguenamanagh AbbeyRoger Stalley, The Cistercian Monasteries of Ireland (London: Yale University Press, 1987), 73. built in Ireland in 1204 has a very similar floor plan as the Abbey of Fontenay. The spirit of Cistercian architecture is simple, conservative, utilitarian and self-sufficient. The Abbey of Fontenay is a typical Cistercian monastery built on these fundamental characteristics. Cistercian monasteries including the Abbey of Fontenay are identified as an offshoot of Romanesque art and a germination of Gothic art. The churches of the monasteries consist of prominent Romanesque architecture features, including symmetrical plan, massive quality, thick walls, sturdy piers, groin vaults, round arches and tall central nave. On the other hand, Gothic architectures evolving from Romanesque architectures was promoted by Cistercians and influenced by Cistercian monasteries. In medieval Europe Cistercians‚Äô motivation of manual labor work became ‚Äúthe main force of technological diffusion‚ÄúCistercians,‚Äù last modified March 12, 2012‚Äù in many fields including metallurgy. The massive use of metal along with metal skills in Gothic architectures is a main element of Gothic art. Furthermore, Gothic churches include features of Cistercian monasteries such as pointed arches. Therefore, Cistercian architectures are considered to be a bridge between Romanesque and Gothic architectures. Buildings Plan of the church. The Abbey was primarily constructed using stones from local areas.‚ÄúFontenay Abbey,‚Äù http://www.francethisway.com/places/abbeyfontenay.php. The church of the abbey is of typical Cistercian architecture, built in the Romanesque style. It is in a Latin cross shape, with a nave 66 metres long and 8 metres wide, two side- aisles, and a transept measuring 19 metres. In contrast to earlier churches, the church of the abbey has a flattened apse and two rectangular (instead of semicircular) chapels of each side of the transept. The cloister measures 36 by 38 metres. The chapter house is vaulted, with heavy ribs. There is a large dormitory which was re-roofed in the fifteenth century with an arched braced roof of chestnut timber. Except for the demolished refectory, the abbey retains almost all of its original buildings: church, dormitory, cloister, chapter house, caldarium or \\"warming room\\", dovecote and forge, all built in Romanesque style. The abbot's lodgings and infirmary were built at a later date. Today the abbey buildings are set in modern manicured parterres of lawn and gravel. Fontenay Abbey - urn (35712327791) In all of the original buildings, neither the exteriors nor interiors are decorated. Although Bernard of Clairvaux did not attempt to reject art or beauty, he was cautious of ‚Äúthose manifestations of beauty which lead the eyes of the mind away from the imago Dei to the imagines mundi (images of the world)Kinder, Cistercian Europe, 15.‚Äù. Although there are no flowers in the capitals, no decorative motifs and no images anywhere, the abbey is still an outstanding artwork. The church and the cloister, the centre of life for monks, were built in logically distributed spaces. In anticipation of the monastery‚Äôs future expansion, instead of creating an enclosed structure, the church and the cloister were created parallel or perpendicular to each other with open ends. In this way, during expansion the existing cloister and church would not be influenced. There is no bell tower in the abbey, because Bernard of Clairvaux felt this would take away from the austerity. As an alternative, small bells were attached into the wall beside the church door to call lay brothers to gather together. In the interior of the church, massive cruciform piers sustain high, large barrel vaults consisting of pointed arches and transverse pointed arches. Diaphragm pointed arches are also evident. The abundant use of pointed arches was chosen because ‚Äúthe pointed arch channels the weight onto the bearing piers or columns at a steep angle,‚ÄúGothic architecture,‚Äù last modified March 14, 2012‚Äù and will support a tall building for thousands of years. Bernard of Clairvaux, who restricted decorations, believed that only light should enter the church. For a long time it was also believed that perfect proportions can be achieved through music. Thus, when designing the glass windows, numerical ratios corresponding to music were applied. For instance, the seven windows in the west of the interior were distributed according to a musical ratio of 3/4.(Paragraph Needs Citation) The thirty-six meter cloister located at the back of the church is divided by pillars into small galleries. In each gallery, double column pillars with lanceolate capitals support a double arches vault. This cloister was an important place for monks to spend their spare time reading, working and praying. Gallery This World Heritage Site has retained the greater part of its Romanesque and Early Gothic monastic buildings, giving uniquely intact picture of a Cistercian monastery of the 12th century.

Originally initiated by Vladimir Lenin as a tool for exposing mismanagement and corruption, several million people worked as people's correspondents in their heyday. At the 17th Party Congress in 1934, Joseph Stalin said there were more than 3 million worker and agriculture correspondents. History  The tradition of people's correspondents‚Äîincluding worker correspondents, known as rabkors (for \\"rabochy korrespondent\\"), and agriculture correspondents (sometimes called village correspondents), known as selkors (for \\"selskokhozyaistvenny or selsky korrespondent\\")‚Äîbegan shortly after the Bolsheviks seized power. In his 1918 article, On the character of our newspapers, Vladimir Lenin urged newspapermen to \\"expose the unfit\\" and unmask the \\"actual malefactors\\" who disrupted production and political work.See Peter Kenez, The birth of the propaganda state. Soviet methods of mass mobilization, 1917-1929 The 8th Party Congress, meeting in March 1919, endorsed the use of worker and agriculture correspondents to monitor the bureaucracy and expose abuse of power.O partiinoi I sovetskoy pechati: sbornik dokumentov, Moscow: Izdatel'stvo \\"Pravda\\", 1954, p. 212. In 1919, Vladimir Lenin instructed the Pravda editorial board to organize a network of regular worker and village correspondents,See the Bolshaya Sovetskaya Entsiklopediya (The Great Soviet Encyclopedia), ed. 1974,: Worker and village correspondents' movement. and by 1926, Leon Trotsky was addressing 580 delegates representing around 500,000 rabkory and selkory at the Third All-Union Congress of Rabkory. Main goals In the years 1923‚Äì1924, all high circulation Soviet newspapers were organizing a regular body of worker and agriculture correspondents. These were supposed to be ordinary working people who would write into the newspapers regularly. Officials in the Communist Party hoped that the correspondents would expose corrupt local officials, provide information on popular moods, and help to mobilize opinion behind the Bolshevik regime. They also hoped to use the worker and agriculture correspondents movement as a tool to educate a new worker/peasant intelligentsia. In pursuit of all of these goals Soviet newspaper editors and journalists during the 1920s and 1930s instructed their worker and village correspondents on appropriate themes and language for their letters. The typical correspondent A high proportion of correspondents were low level Party officials, trade union activists, or representatives of factory management. An ordinary worker correspondent might, e.g., also be a member of a local Party committee. Other worker correspondents belonged to trade union factory committees, provincial trade union Departments of Labor, or cooperative administration. Some of the letters by the correspondents were typed‚Äîindicating that the author probably had access to a typewriter at a government office.Matthew Lenoe, p 144 referring to statistics in the Rabotnitsa archive in Rossiiskii Tsentr Khraneniia i Izucheniia Dokumentov Noveishei Istorii (RTsKhIDNI), 610, pp. 1, d. 8, ll. 1‚Äì10, 15, 19‚Äì20. Instruction Newspapers used a number of channels to instruct worker and village correspondents in the 1920s. The lessons themselves were haphazard and of uneven quality, but instructional materials were distributed widely. According to a Central Committee Press Department survey done in late 1923, Soviet trade union and so called mass worker newspapers used articles, conferences, individual letters, circulars, and roving instructors to inform worker and village correspondents what and how to write. In addition, newspapers published regular instructional journals for the correspondents. One of the instructional journals were the Pravda's Raboche-krest'ianskii korrespondent.Mathew E. Lenoe, pp. 144‚Äì146. Party leaders pushed newspapers and local Party organizations to instruct correspondents in part because they saw the movement as a tool for the education of a new Soviet intelligentsia of workers and peasants. As a number of scholars have noted, the worker and village correspondents movement served as a kind of \\"university\\" where young activists from the laboring masses learned to speak the official language of the Soviet state. Both the organizers of the correspondents movement and the participants were aware of this function. Newspapers instructed correspondents in the use of the new Bolshevik vocabulary, while would-be Party members and activists imitated official discourse in their letters and expressed their desire to learn it thoroughly.Jeffrey Brooks, pp. 18‚Äì35. Ideological supervision Party authorities solicited letters from worker correspondents in order to instruct them in Bolshevik language and ideology. Through written and oral interaction with newspaper editors, instructors, and Party agitators, activists would master the language of the Soviet state. The Bolshevik leaders conceived of the correspondents movement as a classroom in which rank-and-file members of the Party or the Komsomol would learn Marxism-Leninism. Indeed, not just activists eager to learn official language, but even denouncers attempting to put the state apparatus to their own uses were forced to use official rhetoric and socio-political categories to achieve their goals. Those who wished to manipulate the Bolshevik state had to speak its language.On the shift toward direct Party supervision of the worker correspondents' movement in 1926, see, e.g., Julie Kay Mueller, A New Kind of Newspaper: The Origins and Development of a Soviet Institution, 1921‚Äì1928 pp. 264‚Äì315, Ph.D. diss., University of California/Berkeley, 1992. After 1930, greater fear of Stalinist repression and Party activists' increased efforts to use worker and agriculture correspondents to organize rather than register \\"public opinion\\" trammeled letter-writers' frank expression of their opinions. The sphere wherein one could express one's own political opinions without fear of persecution had narrowed to circles of personal friends. Very few people could be expected to express themselves openly to authority. To get even approximately accurate intelligence on the mood and attitudes of the population, the Soviet leaders would have had to resort to sources which tapped private communications, by perlustrating personal letters and building networks of informers.On the worker and village correspondents movement as a tool for educating workers and peasants in Bolshevik language, see Jeffrey Brooks, \\"Public and Private Values in the Soviet Press, 1921‚Äì1928\\", pp. 18‚Äì35; Michael Gorham, Tongue-Tied Writers: The Rabsel'kor Movement and the voice of the \\"new intelligentsiia\\" in early Soviet Russia, pp. 412‚Äì429; Matthew Lenoe, Stalinist Mass Journalism, pp. 34‚Äì44. Reporting style People's correspondents were never known for their critical stances on the government, but they did have a certain degree of freedom to go after petty bureaucrats and bosses. Since many of the articles from people's correspondents that were published over the decades were essentially letters to the editor, they were comically banal because only ideologically sound articles made it to print. For example, one 1958 letter to a Yugra newspaper sent in by an agriculture correspondent named T. Patrakova informed readers that members of the Repolovskoye collective farm \\"warmly\\" said goodbye to Ivan Mikhailov, who worked \\"honestly\\" for 25 years as a blacksmith. \\"Thank you to our party and government, Ivan Yakovlevich says. I will be secure in my old age: I will get a 730-ruble monthly pension,\\" Patrakova wrote.Carl Schreck, Proletarian Bloggers Celebrate a Milestone. Later development The number of people's correspondents began to recede in the 1980s with the onset of Perestroika, and it is unclear how many remain today. In an ironic historical twist, they have now become vehement opponents of the Russian government and President Vladimir Putin - whose own father worked as a worker correspondent. The tradition of the people's correspondent has survived the Soviet collapse thanks largely to Soviet stalwarts such as the Sovietskaya Rossia and the Pravda, which welcome letters, essays and poetry from the amateur scribes. For example, around half of the Sovietskaya Rossia's content is penned by readers and people's correspondents. The newspaper's circulation is 300,000, down from 4.5 million at the end of the 1980s, and it currently has only six people on its editorial staff.

Pecan oil is neutral in flavor and takes on the flavor of whatever seasoning is being used with it. Pecan oil contains 9.5% saturated fat, which is less than in olive oil (13.5%), peanut oil (16.90%) or corn oil (12.70%). It is also used as a massage oil and in aromatherapy applications. Pecan oil is considered a healthy oil as it is rich in monounsaturated fats, specifically oleic acid, (52.0%) and low in saturated fats. It also contains linoleic acid (36.6%), and small amounts of palmitic (7.1%), stearic (2.2%) and linolenic acids (1.5%). The overall balance of fatty acids in the oil may reduce LDL cholesterol (also known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol) and the risk of heart disease. The main application of this oil is its use in cooking. It has a high smoke point of 470 degrees F making it ideal for cooking at high temperatures and for deep frying. The mild nutty flavor enhances the flavor of ingredients, making it a popular component of salad dressings and dips. Pecan oil is much lighter than olive and is well suited for everyday cooking. It also generally does not contain preservatives or additives. Pecan oil is a good substitute for butter and other cooking oils, making it suitable for baking. It is recommended that the oil be refrigerated after opening to increase shelf life and reduce rancidity. Pecan oil can sometimes be hard to find in local grocery stores because it is considered a specialty oil; however, it can be purchased online through a number of manufacturers' websites. Processing Prior to extraction, the nuts are lightly roasted and ground. Mechanical extraction methods are then used to remove the oil. Most manufacturers avoid the use of chemical extraction methods in order to preserve the natural nutty flavor and nutrients of the oil.

All of these were matrilineal communities. The custom is no longer observed. Alternate names for the system were used by different social groups and in different regions; they included Pudavamuri, Pudavakoda, Vastradanam, Vitaram Kayaruka, Mangalam and Uzhamporukkuka.  Practice   Among Nairs  The Nair women were allowed to take a number of husbands, the number could be of dozens but usually there were three or four regular sambandam husbands. The Nair women also had temporary relationships with the Nair soldiers passing through the area. There were no resentment among the Sambandam husbands who also had numerous sambandam wives and they would also arrange schedules to avoid overlaps when they visited their wives at night. The visiting husband placed his weapons outside the bedroom door and if another husband arrived, he might sleep in the veranda after seeing his weapons. If the women became pregnant, one of the husbands usually accepted the child. If no appropriate man accepted the child, then she is deemed to have had sexual intercourse with a man from a lower caste or even from a man belonging to one of the lower Nair sub-castes. The women was punished in front of the entire enangar, abandoned from her caste and could be sold as a slave.  Among Nambudhiri Brahmins  Among the Nambudhiri's, the eldest son was only allowed to marry a brahmin women and make an inheritor to the family's property. The remaining younger sons had sambandam relationships with the Nair women,the elder sons also had sambandham relationships with Nair women along with their brahmin wives.The Brahmins considered this as concubinage because of their paternal lineage and the Nairs however considered this as legitimate marriages because their lineage passed in a maternal line.

It was part of the overall Battle of Hakodate at the end of the Boshin War, a civil war in Japan between Imperial forces of the new Meiji government, and samurai loyalists to the former Tokugawa shogunate under the flag of the newly formed Republic of Ezo. Preparations Despite the surrender of Edo Castle to the new Meiji government and heavy losses at the Battles of Ueno and Aizu, many of the military forces and leaders loyal to the former Tokugawa shogunate refused to accept defeat. With the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei in tatters, a portion of the Tokugawa navy led by Admiral Enomoto Takeaki fled to the northern island of Hokkaid≈ç, together with several thousand soldiers and a handful of French military advisors, and established the Republic of Ezo. The newly created Imperial Japanese Navy departed Tokyo Bay on 9 March 1869 and reached Miyako Bay in what is now the city of Miyako in central Iwate Prefecture, on 20 March. The Imperial fleet had been rapidly formed around the French-built ironclad warship , which had been purchased from the United States. Other ships included , Hiry≈´, , Y≈çshun, and , which had been supplied by the domains of Saga, Ch≈çsh≈´ and Satsuma to the new central government in 1868. There were altogether eight Imperial ships: K≈çtetsu, Kasuga, three small corvettes and three transport ships. Future commander-in-chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy, T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç was an officer on Kasuga at this time. Anticipating that the Imperial fleet was en route to invade Ezo, Enomoto Takeaki decided to dispatch his three warships under the command of Kaigun bugyo Arai Ikunosuke in a boarding operation to seize the revolutionary new warship K≈çtetsu, which would severely cripple the Imperial forces and would buy time for the Republic of Ezo to prepare for invasion or to negotiate more favorable terms with the Satch≈ç Alliance. Action The wreckage of the Takao, pursued by steamships of the Imperial Navy The Ezo forces were let by ( flagship of the Republic of Ezo Navy) under the command of Arai Ikunosuke, and with the elite Shinsengumi, their leader Hijikata Toshiz≈ç, as well as the former French Navy military advisor Henri Nicol. Nicol had been selected for the attack since he was a native of Bordeaux, and knew the characteristics and construction of the warship K≈çtetsu, built in the same city. The overall strategy itself had been planned by another French advisor, Eug√®ne Collache, who also accompanied the mission aboard the (former ) with the elite Shinkitai (‰º∏Êú®Èöä). The third ship in the Ezo squadron was the , with the elite Y≈´gekitai (ÈÅäÊíÉÈöä) and former French Navy quartermaster Clateau, in charge of the cannons. To create surprise, the squadron planned use a false flag operation, with Kaiten entering Miyako Bay under an American flag. However, the operation was plagued with problems before reaching its destination. En route, the squadron encountered bad weather, in which Takao had engine trouble, and Banry≈´ became separated. Banry≈´ eventually returned to Hokkaid≈ç without participating in the battle. Unable to achieve more than due to its engine trouble, Takao trailed far behind when Kaiten began its attack. Kaiten approached the anchored Imperial Navy ships and raised the Republic of Ezo flag seconds before boarding K≈çtetsu. She rammed her prow into the side of K≈çtetsu, and started firing her guns. However, her deck was higher than that of K≈çtetsu by close to three meters, forcing boarding samurai to jump one by one in a trickle. After the initial surprise had passed, K≈çtetsu managed to repel the attack with a Gatling gun, inflicting great losses on the attackers. Most of the attacking samurai perished; Nicol was hit by two bullets, and boarding party commander was killed and his position taken over by Admiral Arai Ikunosuke. In the action, Kaiten damaged three Imperial warships, but finally disengaged without having captured K≈çtetsu. Kaiten steamed out of Miyako Bay, pursued by the Imperial fleet (which had been warming up their engines even before the attack began), just as Takao was entering. Kaiten eventually escaped to Hokkaid≈ç, but Takao was too slow to outdistance its pursuers and was beached at little distance from Miyako Bay, so that her crew could escape inland, and was scuttled by explosion. The 40 crewmen (including 30 samurai and the ex-French officer Eug√®ne Collache) managed to flee for a few days, but finally surrendered to government forces. They were brought to Tokyo for trial. Although the fate of the Japanese rebels is unknown, Collache was eventually pardoned and deported to France. Conclusion The Naval Battle of Miyako was a daring, but desperate attempt by the Republic of Ezo forces to neutralize the powerful K≈çtetsu. It was the first case of an abordage (boarding) maneuver on an ironclad steamship in Japan. Although the attempt ended in failure, the loss of the Takao was marginal. The Imperial Navy continued north unimpeded, and supported landing and combat operations of thousands of government troops in the Battle of Hakodate.

Early years L√©once Crenier was born in Ceton, a small village of the diocese of S√©ez, in Savoie, France, July 31, 1888. According to his \\"Autobiographical Notes\\", his father was made bankrupt and consequently reduced to the condition of a day labourer, living in a tiny room. His mother \\"was a woman full of idealism and hope, energetic and of excellent heart\\". L√©once much admired her and inherited many of her characteristics. There was little discussion of religion in the home. Although baby L√©once was baptized, his parents were not church goers. His mother \\"fell out with the priest and vowed not to set the foot in the church again\\". She continually and enthusiastically evoked \\"Our Lord and his Mother\\" as evocative of a \\"life of love\\". L√©once received his first Communion at twelve years of age, but he stopped attending church and did not attend for Confirmation. He was a sickly student but nevertheless attained excellent result thanks to his sharp intelligence. Acute otitis in his left ear made him partially deaf for the rest of his life. After finishing at college, he became a tax-collector in an obscure corner of France. He studied at the \\"National School of Horticulture\\" in Versailles from 1908 to 1911. He became absorbed with introspection, with a fascination with questions of existence and further such mysteries, with an enthusiasm for the occult being manifested at an early age. However he was finally disillusioned with what he regarded as pseudo- knowledge. In Versailles and Paris he realised the horror of social inequality, the misery of the proletariat and the misdeeds of capitalism. Unable to stand by, he participated in the militant socialist movement, particularly with the Anarcho-Communists. Actually, the anarchism of these young utopians did not present any great danger to the established order. Rejecting violence, this group prepared for the social world of which they dreamed, by much discussion, wrote inflammatory texts, festooned the streets with posters. Until his death, Father Crenier had fond memories of the companions of his militant youth. Conversion to Catholicism In 1913, he felt obliged to join his sister and brother-in-law in Portugal, where he for long of heart remained for seven years. Suffering from a particularly malignant form of typhoid fever, with \\"violent pains started in the hip and the thigh bones, which twisted and were folded in on themselves. Soon, my right leg, become enormous and twisted back\\". He was worried that he might \\"go insane if the pain didn't leave him. The doctors could not do anything more for him. His life would undoubtedly have finished on a bed of hospital of Lisbon had it not been for the intervention of Sister Marie Moutte, of the congregation of Sisters of St Vincent de Paul. She took on the young patient, looking after him with patience and knowledge, such that life forces gradually returned to him along with the hope to survive. Such devotion intrigued him, and he wanted to know its secret. Sister Marie explained to him that such a secret was not to be found in her but in Christ whose example she did her best to follow. \\"He remained in bed for months, devoting himself to prayer, reading and reflection.\\" His discussions with Sister Marie, alongside meditation on the Gospel, and study of Saint John of the Cross that led to conversion to Catholicism. This embrace of Christianity led him to decide to devote his life to religion. Initially he approached the Lazarites who politely got rid of him for obvious reasons. He later wrote \\"I was, weak, deaf, lame and almost voiceless\\". Thereafter, at the summer 1919, a chance meeting with a Benedictine monk directed him towards the small monastery of Cogullada, in Spain, where ten monks carried out a precarious monastic life. Despite his disheveled appearance, L√©once Crenier was accepted when he knocked on their door, as the need for recruits was great.\\"It was my chance\\" he later remarked, \\"as no other monastery wanted me ... I could only enter the Benedictine Order through a concealed door, and Cogullada was that door\\". The instructor of novices, Father Doreillac was a \\"holy old monk who had been ordained in Bordeaux\\". Equally sharing an enthusiasm the day's discussion quickly came to centre on the love of God and after a few minutes \\"we cried so much that the meeting had to end\\". From Cogullada to Abbey of Saint-Beno√Æt-du-Lac Brother Crenier quickly realised that he could not adopt the usual life of a Benedictine monk in this monastery which had been refused canonical recognition and was about to close. So he turned to the abbey of Saint Wandrille, then in exile at Conques in Belgium. He obtained a transfer there. Four years later, in 1924, he moved with the entire community in R√©ray, in France. Completing his philosophical and theological studies, he was ordained priest on March 3, 1928. His horticultural training led him to \\"cherish the hope of being put to work in the garden to help Brother Victor Brother there\\". But the Abbot had other plans for him. At the end of the summer, he asked Crenier to accompany Father Lohier to Canada and to help revitalise a priory which was proving hard to get off the ground. He arrived at the Abbey of St- Beno√Æt-du-Lac on December 2, placed in charge of the noviates. By May 1929, he was under-Prior. Two years later he succeeded Father Lohier as Prior, a post he held until 1944. Precarity The most serious problem facing the new priory was the impending threat of bankruptcy. This problem had haunted all the superiors since its foundation in 1912. Expenditure was greater than income receipts, with the deficit made up with loans. Over the years the debt had considerably increased, particularly under Dom Lohier, and had reached the sum of $29,500. Father Crenier, then sub-prior, did what he could to stop any expenditure which he considered unnecessary: e.g. he blocked the purchase of an expensive car for $800. He saw it as his duty to alert the abbot and provided a very gloomy description of the state of affairs: \\"Our financial standing is exceedingly serious, not to say desperate. If there is not stroke of luck, we are lost. Bankruptcy is but a few weeks off, perhaps... In eight month, our debt will have increased by $4 000.\\" (May 24, 1931) When he became prior, he had to effect this \\"stroke of luck\\", charged by the abbot with clearing the debt. By no means a specialist in administration, Dom Crenier had gained some experience from his time with Cr√©dit Franco-Portugais and the Burnay Bank in Portugal. The first remedy had been to increase the income generated by the work of the monks, but in practice this failed. The farm, where so many of the monks worked, \\"does not bring back absolutely any money for us, but it provides us milk, butter and meat\\". The pastoral ministry preaching in the local parish was profitable but few ordained monks could do it as their absence was completely prejudicial to the liturgical and Community life. The only other alternative was to turn to the outside and to request the generosity of the laymen despite the unfavourable economic situation following the financial crash of 1929. However, Father Crenier reasoned that no one would be interested in giving money to pay off old debts, but rather adopted an audacious policy of saying they would start a building programme to which people could contribute, as with the basilica of Sainte-Anne de Beaupr√©. The abbot was not convinced by this strategy: to contemplate new constructions when one is overwhelmed by debt would be a serious imprudence. The project was abandoned. However some faithful friends in Montreal, became aware of the situation. An uncle of the Brother Rom√©o Thibodeau, Mr Jean Daoust, \\"one of two or three principal members of the Company of the Craftsmen of Quebec\\", obtained from this Company a loan of $11,000 at favourable terms. Working with Mr. Beaudry Leman, he also formed a committee, recruited mainly among the \\"Craftsmen\\", who committed themselves to \\"pay our interests during the first few years\\". However a Mr Mathys also intervened with a generous but unacceptable offer: he promised to pay all the debts of the monastery provided that he was incorporated the Belgian congregation. The Prior, generally supportive of Brother Mathys, made an outright refusal. Embracing austerity The community functioned in these difficult times with the most strict economy. The Prior suggested: \\"we seek to save on everything\\", he wrote, \\"except on food, as we simply eat what remains\\". Outside purchases were reduced; the bread was henceforth baked in the monastery. The orchard and the kitchen garden provided fruit and vegetables and, during autumn, everyone helped in jam making. \\"We already have 700 - 800 boxes of tomatoes\\". These efforts and sacrifices were not in vain. The situation slowly improved as the ruinous practice loans was brought to an end. However, on April 21, 1934, Father Crenier wrote \\"that does not me from being blocked and even frustrated from time to time.. The Lord punishes me for my iniquities, while sending me what I need at the critical moment, but no more. I find that good. Poverty obliges me to hang with God, so to speak. I certainly would not ask for as much I do, if we were comfortable.\\" His firmness in the exercise of his authority was combined with a paternalistic kindness, sensitive to the needs for each one of his monks. But it was that everyone should reach a healthy level of austerity. Amongst his immediate entourage, there were those who would allow the use of tobacco in order to gain recruits, \\"Me, never... I hold good on this point \\". The \\"chaises berceuses\\", another Canadian passion were also prohibited... \\"Life passes by as one sits there smoking and reading a breviary, etc.\\" His decisive argument was, \\"the Trappists of Oka, do without all that and their recruitment is excellent\\". With this program of austerity, the Prior attracted trust and confidence. He succeeded where his predecessor had failed, in making a bond with the local community. He told the abbot, \\"there is on the whole a real desire for sanctification. And, remarkably, the tighter the discipline, the happier everyone is\\". Thirty years later, when he wrote his autobiography, Father Crenier told how of all the years he spent at St-Benoit-du-Lac, those of the great restrictions were happiest, adding \\"I noticed that real poverty, where one misses so many things, attracts singular graces amongst the monks, and in particular spiritual peace and joy.\\" Prior of Saint-Beno√Æt-du-Lac Under the Priorate of Father L√©once Crenier, Saint- Beno√Æt-du-Lac gradually developed. Many new noviates came forward in the first five years (1931 to 1935) ‚Äì 49 applicants were accepted. In 1932, the facilities had to be expanded to build a further twenty cells. The financial position had been stabilized and the budget was balanced without resorting to loans. At this time the issue of the canonical status of the house resurfaced. In 1929, it had been set up as a simple priory. Nothing had changed in relation to the mother-abbey of Saint-Wandrille (France). For several years, the superiors of Saint-Beno√Æt-du-Lac felt irked by the need to refer any important problem to an abbot and a chapter over six thousand kilometers away. The abbot of Saint-Wandrille, Dom Jean-Louis Pierdait, judged that the time had come to make the Canadian monastery autonomous, which, in canonical terms, means to make it a conventual priory. Crenier was entrusted by the Religious of Jesus and Mary with the publication the autobiography of Dina B√©langer, , which became very popular. In the 1930s and 40s, Crenier was associated with in advocating for emphasis on the Sermon on the Mount, a controversial topic within Catholicism at the time. Crenier claimed that the Sermon on the Mount, which he regarded as the essence of Christianity, had been forgotten to such an extent that it seemed revolutionary and heretical., qtd. in Martinique When he retired as Prior at Saint-Beno√Æt-du-Lac, first he went to Portsmouth, Rhode Island in the United States of America. Here he opposed segregation by endeavouring to set up an integrated monastery, but circumstances forced him to move to Martinique. Here, with three companions, he founded the Sainte Marie de Montpel√© monastery in 1947. He remained living there until his death on May 10, 1963. Monsignor Varin de la Brunelli√®re, the Bishop of Martinique, remarked \\"L√©once Crenier was as righteous and sincere, as forthright and generous during his youth with the anarchist utopians as he was in later years in his fervour as a monk.\\"  Works  * Citations  References    Further reading        External links * Les Amis de Saint-Beno√Æt-du-Lac Category:1888 births Category:1963 deaths Category:French Benedictines Category:French Christian monks Category:Christian radicals ","title":"L√©once Crenier"},{"id":"5810597","text":"Talod is a town and a municipality in Sabarkantha district in the Indian state of Gujarat.

At a length of , it was believed to be the longest until it was discovered that the Rio Minho was 92.8 km long.Jamaica National Heritage Trust - Black River Its name refers to the darkness of the river bed caused by thick layers of decomposing vegetation. Over 100 species of birds have been recorded in the Black River morass.  Sources  The river's source is the Cockpit Country where it runs underground before emerging north of Siloah on the southern fringe Cockpits ().UK Directorate of Overseas Surveys 1:50,000 map of Jamaica sheet D, 1959.  Route  Immediately after its emergence, the river meanders gently through the cane fields of the Appleton Estate. It receives a boost from the One Eye River, which is a continuation of the larger Hectors River which forms the Trelawny-Manchester border. Approaching Maggotty, its speed increases and occasional rapids occur. Passing through Maggotty, the river runs alongside the road and goes down several small waterfalls and the Black River Gorge, located in the Apple Valley Park. Running past Newton, the river flows into the Upper Morass being joined by the Smith River and other smaller tributaries, where thick rushes flourish. In the Elim area, a fish farm cultivates the ‚ÄòJesus fish‚Äô, a variety of African perch,Fishbase.org so called because of its reputation as a prolific breeder. The Jacana is also known locally as the ‚ÄòJesus bird,‚Äô as it gives the impression of walking on water when it wades among the floating leaves of aquatic plants. Rasta tourist guide on Black River Lacovia and Middle Quarters are located between the Upper Morass and the Lower Morass. Middle Quarters is famous for its crayfish, known locally as ‚Äòhot pepper shrimps.‚Äô The traps used by the fishermen are similar to those of the Niger River in Africa; knowledge of their making was brought to the island by slaves over 300 years ago. The Lower Morass consists of shallow estuaries, marshland and mangrove swamps, providing a rich ecological environment for a broad range of fish, birds and other creatures including lobsters, mangrove snappers, snook and mullet. Here the river is joined by the YS river making the Lower Morass the largest (14,085 acres) swamp environment in the Caribbean. American crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus) inhabit the swamps, but the population has declined, due mainly to loss of habitat as heavy draining for agricultural or tourist destroys their nesting places. Birds found here include egrets, herons and ospreys. The mangrove trees of the Lower Morass are sometimes spectacular with aerial roots sent out like spiders' legs, sometimes dropping 40 feet into the river. The river reaches the sea () on the eastern edge of the town of the same name.  Commercial use  Logwood tree trunks were floated down the Black River to the port to be shipped to England for making of dyes.

Historically, certificates may have been required to evidence entitlement to dividends, with a receipt for the payment being endorsed on the back; and the original certificate may have been required to be provided to effect the transfer of the shareholding. Over time, these functions have been rendered redundant by statutory schemes to streamline the administrative burden on corporations, and to facilitate and streamline trading on a stock exchange. For example, most jurisdictions now impose an obligation on corporations to pay dividends to shareholders registered at a relevant point of time without the need to produce the share certificate as proof of entitlement and the certificate is no longer required to be produced with a transfer of a shareholding. In some jurisdictions today, the issue of paper stock certificates may be dispensed with, at least in some circumstances, and many corporations now provide a holding statement in lieu of a share certificate for each parcel of shares owned. Most jurisdictions now require corporations to maintain records of ownership or transfers of shareholdings, and do not permit share certificates to be issued to bearer. History Ruben Schalk, history student at the Universiteit Utrecht, discovered (2010) the so far oldest share certificate in the world in the Westfries Archief in Hoorn. The certificate dates from 9 September 1606 and was issued by the VOC-chamber Enkhuizen. It was sold to Pieter Hermanszoon Boode. The second page records the payments of dividend. In the United States and other countries, electronic registration is supplanting the stock certificate, with both public and private companies no longer being required to issue paper certificates. In the United States over 420 of the 7,000-plus publicly traded securities do not issue paper certificates. The United States' Central Securities Depository, the DTC, has continued to promote efforts to completely eliminate paper stock certificates, a process called dematerialization. Countries around the world have adopted similar initiatives with many countries setting deadlines for statutory dematerialization. Brokers may charge up to $500 for issuing a paper certificate, though this fee can be avoided by either holding share in street name (in the United States street name securities are securities held electronically in the account of a stockbroker, similar to a bank account) or registering shares directly with the stock transfer agent and having them issue the certificate. Another alternative to both paper and electronic registration is the use of paper- equivalent electronic stock certificates. Forty-seven states have enacted legislation equivalent to the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, which formalizes equivalency for electronic signatures \\"in writing\\" requirements. This, together with the enactment of legislation permitting the use of \\"facsimile\\" signatures on certificates (such as in ¬ß158 of the Delaware General Corporation Law), has given rise to software as a service technology for private companies to create, issue and manage paper-equivalent electronic stock certificates. In Sweden, share certificates have been largely abolished, people using electronic shares instead (which are either registered in the share owner's name or in the share owner's broker's name). Share certificates may exist in Sweden, but only if the shares are not listed on any stock exchange in Sweden, and the availability of share certificates has nothing to do with voting in shareholders' general meetings. Sometimes a shareholder with a stock certificate can give a proxy to another person to allow them to vote the shares in question. Similarly, a shareholder without a share certificate may often give a proxy to another person to allow them to vote the shares in question. Voting rights are defined by the corporation's charter and corporate law. Stock certificates are generally divided into two forms: registered stock certificates and bearer stock certificates. A registered stock certificate is normally only evidence of title, and a record of the true holders of the shares will appear in the stockholder's register of the corporation. A bearer stock certificate, as its name implies is a bearer instrument, and physical possession of the certificate entitles the holder to exercise all legal rights associated with the stock. Bearer stock certificates are becoming uncommon: they were popular in offshore jurisdictions for their perceived confidentiality, and as a useful way to transfer beneficial title to assets (held by the corporation) without payment of stamp duty. International initiatives have curbed the use of bearer stock certificates in offshore jurisdictions, and tend to be available only in onshore financial centres, although they are rarely seen in practice. Legal characterization of a stock certificate A stock certificate represents a legal proprietary interest in the common stock (in the sense of the general fund) or assets of the issuer corporation. The certificate evidences a chose in action against the issuer to collect dividends and usually to influence the issuer through voting pursuant to the issuer's charter and bylaws, which are often implied or incorporated by reference as terms on the face of the certificate. Stockholder rights are subject to the solvency requirements of issuer's general creditors and to any terms and conditions validly placed upon the face of the stock certificate which are part of the total agreement between the particular stockholder and the issuer. Stock certificates are transferred as negotiable or quasi- negotiable instruments by indorsement and delivery, and issuer charters typically require that transfers must be registered with the issuer (usually via the issuer's transfer agent) in order for the transferee to join as a member of the corporation. Registration of transfer is a type of novation.

It was originally transmitted on Friday, 11 December 1970. Synopsis Following the bombing of ARP HQ, Hodges moves his wardens into the church hall alongside the Home Guard. Mainwaring, appalled by this development, protests to the vicar, Area HQ, the Civil Defence people and a fellow Rotarian, and eventually Hodges' mob are ordered to leave, but not for another week. Plot While Mainwaring is testing his new communication system, talking through sweet tins strung together by string, trouble is brewing on the horizon. The ARP Headquarters was bombed the previous night, and the town clerk and vicar have given them permission to move in with the Home Guard at the church hall. Mainwaring, naturally, is appalled at having to share his office with Hodges, and the hall with his \\"rabble\\". He orders his men to get rid of him, and Corporal Jones chases him out with a bayonet. Hodges returns, this time with the vicar and the verger and takes over half the hall. The Home Guard platoon struggle to come to terms with this new sharing arrangement, and even Walker who's usually shrewd in business is unimpressed, though he takes the chance to sell the Wardens a 'firelighter' to light the stove. While Mainwaring and Hodges are wrestling for control of the office telephone, a call comes through warning them of a fire that has started at a large building next to St Aldhems church. After initially calling for the fire brigade, they realise that it is in fact their own headquarters burning, and the chimney set alight by Walker's firelighter. The Wardens and Home Guard combine forces to try to put it out, entailing a rooftop drama with a hose and buckets of water. Eventually Wilson puts out the fire with a pinch of salt, despite Hodges's scepticism. Just as they are about to exit the roof, Mainwaring, Hodges and their men are trapped in a thunderstorm by a falling ladder, leading Mainwaring to ask Wilson if \\"the Fire Brigade wouldn't mind popping round\\".

In relation to Yoga, it is sometimes called \\"the ocean breath\\". Unlike some other forms of pranayama, the ujjayi breath is typically done in association with asana practice in some styles of yoga as exercise, such as Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga. Ujjayi is a diaphragmatic breath, which first fills the lower belly (said to activate the first and second chakras), rises to the lower rib cage (said to correspond to the third and fourth chakras), and finally moves into the upper chest and throat. The technique is very similar to the three-part Tu-Na breathing found in Taoist Qigong practice. Inhalation and exhalation are both done through the nose. The \\"ocean sound\\" is created by moving the glottis as air passes in and out. As the throat passage is narrowed so, too, is the airway, the passage of air through which creates a \\"rushing\\" sound. The length and speed of the breath is controlled by the diaphragm, the strengthening of which is, in part, the purpose of ujjayi. The inhalations and exhalations are equal in duration, and are controlled in a manner that causes no distress to the practitioner. Etymology \\"Ujjayi\\" comes from the Sanskrit prefix \\"ud\\" (‡§â‡§¶‡•ç) added to it and root \\"ji\\" (‡§ú‡§ø): \\"ujji\\" (‡§â‡§ú‡•ç‡§ú‡§ø), meaning \\"to be victorious\\". Ujjayi (‡§â‡§ú‡•ç‡§ú‡§æ‡§Ø‡•Ä), thus means \\"one who is victorious\\". Ujjayi breath means \\"victorious breath\\". Benefits According to Tirumalai Krishnamacharya, who taught the creators of Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, Iyengar Yoga and others,Fernando Pag√©s Ruiz, \\"Krishnamacharya's Legacy\\" in Yoga Journal Ujjayi Pranayama is a balancing and calming breath which increases oxygenation and builds internal body heat. Ujjayi breathing may be used continuously throughout Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, and is frequently used in Power Yoga and Vinyasa, or Flow Yoga. This breathing technique enables the practitioner to maintain a rhythm to his or her practice, take in enough oxygen, and helps build energy to maintain the practice, while clearing toxins out of the bodily system. This breath is especially important during the transition into and out of asanas (postures), as it helps practitioners to stay present, self-aware and grounded in the practice, which lends it a meditative quality. Ujjayi Breath is also known as Ujjayi Pranayama.

Types of kininogen  There are two main types of kininogen (KNG), high-molecular-weight-kininogen and low-molecular-weight-kininogen, with a third type ‚Äì T-kininogen ‚Äì only found in rats but not humans.  High molecular weight kininogen  High-molecular-weight-kininogen (HK) is a non- enzymatic cofactor involved in the kinin-kallikrein system, which plays a role in blood coagulation, blood pressure regulation, and inflammation. It is synthesized in endothelial cells and is produced mostly by the liver. It is also a precursor protein for bradykinin. Protein structure of bradykinin. Bradykinin is a nine amino acid-long polypeptide made by the cleavage of high- molecular-weight kininogen at D4. It acts as an inflammatory mediator.  Low molecular weight kininogen  Low-molecular-weight-kininogen (LK) is mainly a precursor protein for kallidin. LK, however, is not actively involved in blood coagulation, but its byproducts can be later converted and introduced to the coagulation pathway.  T-kininogen  T-kininogen (TK) is only found in rats and a protein whose function is still being researched. TK is believed to be a biological indicator of senescence in rats, which can be measured by the level of endothelial cell production during the aging process.  Structure  HK consists of 644 amino acid residues, which are separated into six different domains. Domains 1, 2, and 3 are called the ‚Äúheavy chain‚Äù with Domains 2 and 3 having cysteine protease activity. Domains 5 and 6 are called the ‚Äúlight chain,‚Äù both of which bind specific molecules: Domain 5 binds heparin and zinc and selectively binds to anionic surfaces while Domain 6 binds prekallikrein, the protease precursor to plasma kallikrein. Domain 4 connects the heavy chain and light chain together, and its cleavage at this site releases bradykinin. LK consists of 427 amino acid residues, which can also be separated into a ‚Äúheavy chain‚Äù and a ‚Äúlight chain.\\" T-kininogen consists of 430 amino acid residues. HK and LK are created by the alternative splicing of the same kininogen (KNG) gene, which in humans, is located at chromosome 3q27. Kininogens are related to cystatins through their similar glycosylated regions.  Function   High-molecular weight kininogen  During the contact activation system (CAS), also known as the intrinsic pathway, the binding of HK, factor XII (FXII), and prekallikrein (PK) to an anionic surface initiates blood coagulation and the kinin-kallikrein system through the activation of a cascade of enzymes. Factor XII is a zymogen, and upon binding with tissue to the anionic surface, exhibits some protease activity, starting the enzymatic cascade. Both the intrinsic and its corresponding extrinsic pathway, which is activated when outside trauma activates tissue factor (TF), an important glycoprotein, culminate in the activation of a serine protease called Factor X. Factor X is responsible for the conversion of prothrombin into an important protease in clotting called thrombin, which itself participates in the clotting cascade by activating more enzymes and proteins downstream in order to create even more thrombin. In the kinin-kallikrein system, the proteolytic cleavage of HK by the enzyme plasma kallikrein makes bradykinin, an inflammatory mediator that can lower blood pressure by way of vasodilation. The kinin-kallikrein system plays a small role in coagulation. Blood clotting cascade. The blood clotting cascade consists of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway, both of which create thrombin, a protease involved in blood clotting. The intrinsic pathway requires kininogen, specifically high molecular weight kininogen, as a cofactor. HK and LK are noncompetitive inhibitors of activated thrombin.  Low-molecular weight kininogen  The proteolytical cleavage of LK by tissue kallikreins creates kallidin, which is a possible substrate for carboxypeptidase M. Kallidin can be converted into bradykinin by Aminopeptidase B, creating a connection between LK and the kinin-kallikrein system.  T-kininogen  Research has shown that T-kininogen is a possible biomarker for senescence within rats.  Disease and medical relevance  Increased levels of kininogen in the plasma and tissues are associated with injury, inflammation, myocardial infarction, and diabetes. Additionally, kininogen's role in the contact activation system means that increased levels of kininogen can also contribute to the development of hereditary angioedema, a disorder characterized by periodic episodes of swelling. KNG is believed to play a role in the formation of thrombi, or blood clots that obstruct a vessel, and in inflammation. The inhibition of KNG is potentially a selective strategy to fight stroke, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and other venous thromboembolic diseases. Kininogen-1 has also been found to be an effective biomarker in detecting certain types of cancer, namely colorectal cancer. Bradykinin, the cleavage product of high molecular weight kininogen, is implicated by a class of drugs called angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) that aim to increase bradykinin levels by impeding its degradation.

It was originally transmitted on Friday 18 December 1970. Synopsis Mainwaring has always epitomised the principle of military sobriety to his men, but, after Captain Square leads him astray one day in the Officer's Mess, he ends up inebriated. Only something genuinely heroic now can restore his damaged reputation in the eyes of his men. Plot The platoon arrive at a weekend country training camp to teach them about bombs. The camp is run by a twitchy Captain Reed (Michael Knowles) frightened by the enthusiasm and lack of awareness shown by the Home Guard. He is particularly unsettled by the Walmington-on-Sea platoon, especially Corporal Jones. The story largely follows Captain Mainwaring's fall from grace in the eyes of his platoon, and subsequent redemption. When the men are bivouacked in a tent, he falls under the influence of Captain Square who convinces him to set up an officers only section, much to the outrage of his men. He subsequently offends them by attending a select officers mess, drinking whisky with Captain Square and colleagues, and playing \\"Cardinal Puff\\" while his men enjoy a couple of bottles of ale elsewhere. Most of the men are disgruntled, while noting this is not Mainwaring's normal behaviour. Frazer goes so far as to threaten to resign (his general surly attitude of late has led Mainwaring to suspect he is a communist, noting he \\"never plays Monopoly with the others\\" as evidence of his suspicions). A drunken Mainwaring returns to their tent only to be jumped on by Corporal Jones, thinking he is a thuggee. The next morning, a rather hungover and worse for wear Captain Mainwaring joins his men for training. While at first things go seemingly to plan, potential disaster soon strikes when a stray grenade is fired into the roof of the platoon's van. Mainwaring immediately goes to warn Jones, who abandons the van while it is moving. A cool Mainwaring then stops and evacuates the van, but the van is stood next to power lines. Mainwaring re-enters the van and recovers the stray grenade: his command of the situation restoring his reputation in the eyes of the platoon. After Mainwaring throws the grenade away and dives for safety he hears panting, looking up to see the grenade being held by a shaggy dog. Mainwaring flees only to be chased down the road by the dog as the episode ends.

Authorised by the European Medicines Agency on 28 August 2007, it stimulates erythropoiesis (increasing red blood cell levels) and is used to treat anemia, commonly associated with chronic kidney failure and cancer chemotherapy. Epoetin is manufactured and marketed by Amgen under the trade name Epogen. Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Janssen Biotech (formerly Ortho Biotech Products, LP), sells the same drug under the name Procrit, pursuant to a product license agreement. The average cost per patient in the U.S. was $8,447 in 2009. Darbepoetin alfa (rINN) is a glycosylation analog of erythropoietin containing two additional N-linked carbohydrate chains, also manufactured and marketed by Amgen, with a trade name of Aranesp. The FDA warnings and safety precautions for Procrit, Epogen and Aranesp are identical. For several years, epoetin alfa has accounted for the single greatest drug expenditure paid by the U.S. Medicare system; in 2010, the program paid $2 billion for the drug. Raising hemoglobin levels has been found in some studies to be associated with higher risks of thrombotic events, strokes and death.Anemia drugs made billions, but at what cost? By Peter Whoriskey, Washington Post, July 19, 2012  Medical uses  Erythropoietin is available as a therapeutic agent produced by recombinant DNA technology in mammalian cell culture. It is used in treating anemia resulting from chronic kidney disease and myelodysplasia, from the treatment of cancer (chemotherapy and radiation).  Anemia caused by kidney disease  For patients who require dialysis or have chronic kidney disease, iron should be given with erythropoietin, depending on some laboratory parameters such as ferritin and transferrin saturation. Dialysis patients in the U.S. are most often given Epogen; other brands of epoetin may be used in other countries. Erythropoietin is also used to treat anemia in people with chronic kidney disease who are not on dialysis (those in Stage 3 or 4 disease and those living with a kidney transplant). There are two types of erythropoietin for people with anemia due to chronic kidney disease (not on dialysis).  Anemia caused by cancer  In March 2008, a panel of advisers for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) supported keeping erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) produced by Amgen and Johnson & Johnson on the market for use in cancer patients. The FDA has focused its concern on study results from some clinical trials showing an increased risk of death and tumor growth in chemotherapy patients taking the anti-anemia drugs.  Anemia in critically ill people  Erythropoietin is used to treat people with anemia resulting from critical illness. In a randomized controlled trial, erythropoietin was shown to not change the number of blood transfusions required by critically ill patients. A surprising finding in this study was a small mortality reduction in patients receiving erythropoietin. This result was statistically significant after 29 days but not at 140 days. The mortality difference was most marked in patients admitted to the ICU for trauma. The authors provide several hypotheses for potential etiologies of this reduced mortality, but, given the known increase in thrombosis and increased benefit in trauma patients as well as marginal nonsignificant benefit (adjusted hazard ratio of 0.9) in surgery patients, it could be speculated that some of the benefit might be secondary to the procoagulant effect of erythropoietin. Regardless, this study suggests further research may be necessary to see which critical care patients, if any, might benefit from administration of erythropoietin. Any benefit of erythropoietin use must be weighed against the increased likelihood of thrombosis, which has been demonstrated in numerous trials .  Neurological diseases  Erythropoietin has been hypothesized to be beneficial in treating certain neurological diseases such as schizophrenia and stroke. Some research has suggested that erythropoietin improves the survival rate in children suffering from cerebral malaria, which is caused by the malaria parasite's blockage of blood vessels in the brain. However, the possibility that erythropoietin may be neuroprotective is inconsistent with the poor transport of the chemical into the brain and the low levels of erythropoietin receptors expressed on neuronal cells.  Preterm infants  Infants born early often require transfusions with red blood cells and have low levels of erythropoietin. Erythropoietin has been studied as a treatment option to reduce anemia in preterm infants. Treating infants less than 8 days with erythropoietin old may slightly reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions, but increases the risk of retinopathy. Due to the limited clinical benefit and increased risk of retinopathy, early or late erythropoietin treatment is not recommended for preterm infants.  Adverse effects  Epoetin alfa is generally well tolerated. Common side effects include high blood pressure, headache, disabling cluster migraine (resistant to remedies), joint pain, and clotting at the injection site. Rare cases of stinging at the injection site, skin rash, and flu-like symptoms (joint and muscle pain) have occurred within a few hours following administration. More serious side effects, including allergic reactions, seizures and thrombotic events (e.g., heart attacks, strokes, and pulmonary embolism) rarely occur. Chronic self-administration of the drug has been shown to cause increases in blood hemoglobin and hematocrit to abnormally high levels, resulting in dyspnea and abdominal pain.R. Baselt, Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man, 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 547-549. Erythropoietin is associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular complications in patients with kidney disease if it is used to target an increase of hemoglobin levels above 13.0 g/dl. Early treatment (before an infant is 8 days old) with erythropoietin correlated with an increase in the risk of retinopathy of prematurity in premature and anemic infants, raising concern that the angiogenic actions of erythropoietin may exacerbate retinopathy. Since anemia itself increases the risk of retinopathy, the correlation with erythropoietin treatment may be incidental.  Safety advisories in anemic cancer patients  Amgen sent a \\"dear doctor\\" letter in January 2007 that highlighted results from a recent anemia of cancer trial, and warned doctors to consider use in that off-label indication with caution. Amgen advised the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the results of the DAHANCA 10 clinical trial. The DAHANCA 10 data monitoring committee found that three-year loco-regional cancer control in subjects treated with Aranesp was significantly worse than for those not receiving Aranesp (p=0.01). In response to these advisories, the FDA released a Public Health Advisory on March 9, 2007, and a clinical alert for doctors on February 16, 2007, about the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) such as epogen and darbepoetin. The advisory recommended caution in using these agents in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy or off chemotherapy, and indicated a lack of clinical evidence to support improvements in quality of life or transfusion requirements in these settings. In addition, on March 9, 2007, drug manufacturers agreed to new black box warnings about the safety of these drugs. On March 22, 2007, a congressional inquiry into the safety of erythropoietic growth factors was reported in the news media. Manufacturers were asked to suspend drug rebate programs for physicians and to also suspend marketing the drugs to patients. Several publications and FDA communications have increased the level of concern related to adverse effects of ESA therapy in selected groups. In a revised black box warning, the FDA notes significant risks, advising that ESAs should be used only in patients with cancer when treating anemia specifically caused by chemotherapy, and not for other causes of anemia. Further, the warning states that ESAs should be discontinued once the patient's chemotherapy course has been completed.  Interactions  Drug interactions with erythropoietin include: * Major: lenalidomide‚Äîrisk of thrombosis * Moderate: cyclosporine‚Äîrisk of high blood pressure may be greater in combination with EPO. EPO may lead to variability in blood levels of cyclosporine. * Minor: ACE inhibitors may interfere with hematopoiesis by decreasing the synthesis of endogenous erythropoietin or decreasing bone marrow production of red blood cells.Drug Interactions of Erythropoietin Alfa at Drugs.com Society and culture The publication of an editorial questioning the benefits of high-dose epoetin was canceled by the marketing branch of a journal after being accepted by the editorial branch highlighting concerns of conflict of interest in publishing. In 2011, author Kathleen Sharp published a book, Blood Feud: The Man Who Blew the Whistle on One of the Deadliest Prescription Drugs Ever,archive-url= archive-date=January 5, 2012 alleging drug maker Johnson & Johnson encouraged doctors to prescribe epoetin in high doses, particularly for cancer patients, because this would increase sales by hundreds of millions of dollars. Former sales representatives Mark Duxbury and Dean McClennan, claimed that the bulk of their business selling epoetin to hospitals and clinics was Medicare fraud, totaling billion. Biosimilars In August 2007, Binocrit, Epoetin Alfa Hexal, and Abseamed were approved for use in the European Union.

Bernardo Mattarella was the father of Piersanti and Sergio Mattarella, who both became politicians as well; Sergio is the President of the Italian Republic since 3 February 2015 and Piersanti was President of the Regional Government of Sicily, before being assassinated in 1980 by Cosa Nostra. Early life and political career Bernardo Mattarella was born in Castellammare del Golfo, in the province of Trapani in western Sicily as the eldest of seven children in a family of humble origins. His father was a sailor.Bolignani, Bernardo Mattarella: biografia politica di un cattolico siciliano, p. 11 In 1924, he became the secretary of the Italian People's Party (Partito Popolare Italiano), the predecessor of the Christian Democrat party (DC), in Castellammare. Bernardo Mattarella , portale \\"Alcide De Gasperi nella storia d'Europa\\" (Accessed 8 June 2011) An anti-fascist, he graduated in law in Palermo, where he lived until the Allied invasion of Sicily. He moved to Rome, where he took part in the founding of the DC in May 1943 with Alcide De Gasperi. After the invasion of Sicily by allied forces in July 1943, he moved back to Palermo where he became one of the co-founders of the DC on the island and was nominated in the municipal council of Palermo by the Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories (AMGOT). Positions in the Italian Government He held the position of Deputy Minister for Public Education in the governments led by Ivanoe Bonomi (1944‚Äì1945). In the June 1946 he was elected to the Italian Constituent Assembly and in 1948 to the new Republican Parliament. He would be re-elected in 1953, 1958, 1963 and 1968. In 1953, after having been Minister of the Merchant Navy under De Gasperi's short-lived government, he became Minister of Transportation, a position he maintained until 1955. Later he was Minister of Foreign Trade and Minister of Post and Communications. A favourable evaluation of his work as the Minister of Foreign Trade and of Post and Communications is expressed in Guido Carli's memories.Carli, G.

In 1963‚Äì66 he was again Minister of Foreign Trades. Attitude towards Sicilian Separatism Bernardo Mattarella was the main opponent of the Sicilian separatism, which had some influence in the years following the end of World War II. He expressed his concern in an article published in 1944 attacking the leader of the separatists, Andrea Finocchiaro Aprile: \\"This man speaks of democracy, but he has the grave fault of having gathered and tried to strengthen the most dangerous and oppressing organization which, for long years, has afflicted our land.\\"Popolo e Libert√†, 3 June 1944 Accusations of links with the Mafia Mattarella has been accused several times of having links with the Mafia. These accusations were always rejected in court. The alleged links between Mattarella and the Mafia are described in several reports and books. According to a report of the section of the Communist Party of Trapani, which was reproduced in the final report of the Antimafia Commission in 1976, Mattarella had an excellent relationship with the Mafia boss of Alcamo, Vincenzo Rimi. Relazione conclusiva, Commissione parlamentare d‚Äôinchiesta sul fenomeno della mafia in Sicilia, Rome 1976, p. 813-815Casarrubea, \\"Fra' diavolo\\" e il governo nero, p. 84 The Communist minority of the Parliamentary Antimafia Commission described Mattarella as the man \\"who had striven to absorb Mafia forces into the Christian Democrats so as to use them as an instrument of power.\\"Orlando, Fighting the Mafia and Renewing Sicilian Culture, p. 47 Sergio, the future president of Italy, in 1963. He was accused of having approached Calogero Vizzini, supposedly the most influential Mafia boss at the time to abandon the Sicilian separatists and join the Christian Democrats. The accusation was made by the Italian communists on the basis of an article that Mattarella published on the national Christian democrat newspaper, Il Popolo, on 24 September 1944. This article does not contain any invitation neither to Vizzini nor to the Mafia to join the Christian Democrats. On the contrary, the article accused two families of the town of Villalba (Vizzini and Cipolla) of being responsible of the violence in that town. The article was addressed to those who had voted for the separatists, which were invited to change their vote.See e.g. the article of Li Causi, leader of the Sicilian communists, in their newspaper La voce comunista, on 21 July 1946 In a letter to Luigi Sturzo, written shortly after the election of the Constituent Assembly of Italy in 1946, Mattarella wrote about the electoral and political influence of the Mafia: \\"The electoral fight has been hard and tiring, but it has granted us the result of the full failure of the Mafia: it has been defeated by the state ballot, which has freed electors from old style pressures, which have been now and then renewed.\\"Letter of 29 June 1946. See De Marco, Sturzo e la Sicilia nel secondo dopoguerra (1943‚Äì1959), S.E.I., Torino 1996, 47 According to a report of the Carabinieri on the electoral campaign of 1946 in Salemi, Mattarella gathered with known mafiosi, among them Ignazio Salvo, one of the Salvo cousins who became intermediates between the Mafia and the DC.Hess, Mafia & mafiosi, p. 159 Deaglio, Il raccolto rosso, 1982‚Äì2010, p. 137Dickie, pp. 423‚Äì24 Mattarella supported Vito Ciancimino ‚Äì the first Italian politician to be found guilty of Mafia membership. Ciancimino became a prot√©g√© of Mattarella, who supported his political and financial career. In 1950 Ciancimino obtained concessions for all railway transport inside Palermo. The three other firms that had made a bid were put out of the game, because Ciancimino's bid was accompanied by a letter of Mattarella, who was then Minister of Transports.

The bloodbath was perpetrated by the bandit Salvatore Giuliano who was possibly backed by the Mafia. In the Portella della Ginestra massacre trial in 1950‚Äì51 in Viterbo, Giuliano's right-hand man Gaspare Pisciotta said: \\"Those who have made promises to us are called Bernardo Mattarella, Prince Alliata, the monarchist MP Marchesano and also Signor Scelba, Minister for Home Affairs ... it was Marchesano, Prince Alliata and Bernardo Mattarella who ordered the massacre of Portella di Ginestra. Before the massacre they met Giuliano...\\" Mattarella, Alliata and Marchesano were declared innocent by the Court of Appeal of Palermo, at a trial which dealt with their alleged role in the event.Servadio, pp. 128‚Äì9, which is actually inaccurate on this point, as Mattarella was never put under investigation nor under trial for the Portella della ginestra bloodbath. In the trial, the accused persons were Alliata, Marchesano and Cusumano, who had been accused by Giuseppe Montalbano, a communist member of Parliament (Audition of on. Giuseppe Montalbano before the Parliamentary Commission of Enquiry on Mafia in Sicily ‚Äì Report on the relation between Mafia and banditry, approved on 10 February 1972, document XXIII n. 2-sexies). The Court of Viterbo decided that Pisciotta had made false accusations. In his final statement the public prosecutor affirmed that Pisciotta was unreliable and that his accusations against Scelba and Mattarella were untrustworthy.

In an interview in the newspaper Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno, he put forward several proposals that influenced the constitution of the Commission in 1963.See the proceedings of the colloquium Cattolici, Chiesa e mafia, University of Messina, November 27‚Äì29, 2003 Accusations by Danilo Dolci Bernardo Mattarella in 1964. The Antimafia activist Danilo Dolci also accused Mattarella of collusion with the Mafia. Dolci had been gathering evidence on the links between the Mafia and politicians for the Antimafia Commission, which was established in 1963. At a press conference in September 1965, he presented dozen of testimonies of people who had supposedly seen Mattarella meeting with leading mafiosi.Bess, Michael (1993), Realism, utopia, and the mushroom cloud: four activist intellectuals and their strategies for peace, 1945‚Äì1989, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, , pp. 194‚Äì97 Danilo Dolci e la dimensione utopica , di Livio Ghersi (accessed 2 March 2011) Mattarella sued Dolci for libel. Mattarella's lawsuit for libel allowed Dolci ‚Äúampia facolt√† di prova‚Äù, meaning that the defendant would have been declared innocent if he had been able to show that he had offended the plaintiff on the basis of true evidence. In the ensuing two-year trial, dozens of witnesses were heard and many documents were considered. Dolci made an application for an amnesty, but was sentenced to two years imprisonment for libel. He never served the verdict, because of a general pardon. When the Court refused to allow new evidence from witnesses, Dolci and Alasia decided that the trial was a travesty. They announced that under these circumstances they would no longer attempt to defend themselves. The remainder of the trial, therefore, took place with Dolci and Alasia absent from the courtroom. Dolci responded by broadcasting his opinions over a private radio station, which was promptly closed. Ragone, Le parole di Danilo Dolci , pp. 220-22 On 21 June 1967, the Court of Rome, sentenced that Mattarella offered reliable evidence of his opposition to the Mafia in the entire course of his political career. The statements collected by the defendants ‚Äì Dolci and his assistant Alasia ‚Äì were considered nothing more than \\"deplorable gossip, malicious rumour or even simple lies.\\" The Court was of the opinion that Mattarella \\"never had relations with the Mafia environment.\\"Decision of the Tribunal of Roma, 21 June 1967, published in ‚ÄúIl Foro italiano‚Äù 1968, 342 ff., confirmed by both the Court of Appeals of Rome (7 July 1972) and the Court of Cassation, VI chamber (26 June 1973). Trent'anni dall'omicidio di Piersanti Mattarella: L'\\"uomo nuovo\\" della Democrazia cristiana, asud'europa, 25 January 2010 Mattarella won the trial but lost a cabinet post in the new government of Aldo Moro. According to the journalist and politician Luigi Barzini, who had been a member of the Antimafia Commission, few of Dolci's charges against Mattarella, most of which were undoubtedly true but not all as decisive as he thought, could be proved in a court of law, as Sicilian witnesses rarely repeat in public what they might have said secretly to a trusted friend.Sicilians and Others; reply by Luigi Barzini, The New York Review of Books, 4 December 1969 Other accusations US gangster Joe Bonanno claimed that Mattarella was among the welcoming party that met him when he landed at Fiumicino airport in Rome in October 1957 for a vacation. Both had grown up in Castellammare del Golfo.A Man of Honour (1983), written with Sergio Lalli, New York: Simon & Schuster E' morto Joe Bonanno fond√≤ Cosa nostra in Usa, La Repubblica, 13 May 2002Dickie, p. 290 of the first edition. However, the author has recognized that these facts are not true and has removed any reference to them in the second and in the third edition of the book. However, the claim seems to be fictional: it describes Bonanno's trip to Italy in September 1957, in the company of F. Pope, the editor of the newspaper ‚ÄúIl progresso italo americano‚Äù. As reported by the same newspaper they arrived in Rome on 13 September of that year.Il Progresso Italo americano, 17 September 1957 According to Pope and Italian newspapers, Mattarella was not in Rome that day. As Minister of the Post, was in another remote Italian town to inaugurate a public work.Giornale di Sicilia, cronichles of Trapani, 14 September 1957See also: Sergio Mattarella's letters to the editor in Interventi e repliche, Corriere della Sera, 14 May 2002, and Le lettere, La Repubblica, 11 October 2002 In 1996, 25 years after Mattarella died, Francesco Di Carlo, a Mafia pentito, said he had been a \\"man of honour\\" ‚Äì a member of Cosa Nostra. 'Vi dico i nomi dei padri della mafia', La Repubblica, 11 October 1996 His son Sergio Mattarella dismissed such accusations as ridiculous. Un giudice dietro l'omicidio Mattarella, La Repubblica, 12 October 1996; Giornale di Sicilia, 13 October 1996 According to another pentito, Francesco Marino Mannoia, Mattarella was close with the Mafia boss Francesco Paolo Bontade, but Mannoia said he did not know if Mattarella actually had been a member of the Mafia. 'Venne dai boss ho visto e giuro', La Repubblica, 15 April 1993 Death and legacy Mattarella died in Rome in 1971. Journalist Gaia Servadio described him as an elegant gentleman with an elaborate and fluent discourse that disclosed his legal training. He was recognized as an able minister, in particular at the post of Foreign Trade, which he held twice. His son Piersanti Mattarella was killed by Mafia in 1980. His assassination was probably spurred by his strong commitment against the relationships of numerous Sicilian politicians (mostly members of DC itself) with the Mafia. He was \\"committed to introducing a new transparency in the functioning of his party and in the Sicilian public life\\".Dickie, third ed., 2009, p. 448 However, the Mafia felt betrayed by the Mattarellas who used to be responsive to Mafia interests. According to Leoluca Orlando ‚Äì former mayor of Palermo for the DC and Antimafia activist, who had been a legal adviser to Piersanti Mattarella ‚Äì the rumours about his father and his party's experiences with the Mafia were probably responsible for Piersanti's aspiration to clean the Christian Democrat party of any such connections. His other son Sergio Mattarella was elected by parliament to be the 12th President of the Italian Republic in January 2015, being the first Sicilian to have held the post.

The Rainbow Nation Peace Ritual as it eventually came to be known, was actually planned some ten days before the announcement by the Rainbow People's Party and the ritual, march, celebration or carnival, call it what you will, involved children as well as innocent bystanders who were taken by surprise.

Almost all areas of the world are within the boundaries of an LDS Church mission, whether or not any of the church's missionaries live or proselytize in the area. As of July 2018, there were 407 missions of the LDS Church. On January 2, 2019, the LDS Church announced changes that will close 12 missions through boundary realignments and open up 4 new ones, effective July 1, 2019. When these changes take place, there will be 399 missions of the church.  Administrative structure  Many LDS missions have logos or seals. This was the seal of the Arizona Tucson Mission from 2002‚Äì05. Geographically, a mission may be a city, a city and surrounding areas, a state or province, or perhaps an entire country or even multiple countries. Typically, the name of the mission is the name of the country (or state in the United States), and then the name of the city where the mission headquarters office is located.The main exceptions to this rule are the Singapore Mission and Baltic States Mission of the church. Also in the cases of such missions as the Washington, D.C. South Mission the designated city is not in the mission at all, but it is identified with that city because none in the mission boundaries are large enough. Also, there are missions such as the Michigan Detroit Mission, where the mission office is in Farmington, Michigan but the name of the largest city in the mission is used. A consultation of the 2007 Deseret News Church Almanac will show this and other exceptions to the generalized rule. New missionaries receive a formal mission call, assigning them to a particular mission for the duration of their two years or eighteen months of service. Each mission has, on average, about 150 missionaries serving there. Mission president The mission home for the Bulgaria Sofia Mission. A mission home is the official residence of a Mission president. :See main article: Mission president All missionaries serve in a mission under the direction of a mission president, who, like individual missionaries, is assigned by the LDS Church president. The mission president must be a married high priest in the Melchizedek Priesthood; his wife is asked to serve alongside him. In 2013 the mission president's wife was given additional leadership roles in the mission. Mission presidents are typically in their forties or older, and usually have the financial means to devote themselves full-time to the responsibility for three consecutive years. The church provides mission presidents with a minimal living allowance but it normally requires them to supplement it with their own funds. Often, the mission president must learn the local language spoken in the mission, as the missionaries do (although many mission presidents today have either previously served a mission in the mission language or speak the mission language as their native language). The mission president has at least two counselors, who are Latter-day Saints usually from the local area who keep their regular employment. The role of the counselors varies by mission, but they typically serve as liaisons between the mission and the local membership of the church. In some areas where the church is newer senior men who are serving full-time missions along with their wives may be called as counselors in the mission presidency. Mission councils Like other units of the church, a leadership council is used to assist in the governance of the mission. Prior to April 2013, this was often called a zone leader council, consisting of the mission president, assistants to the mission president and zone leaders. In April 2013 the zone leader council was replaced by the mission leadership council, which adds the mission president's wife and sister training leaders, a new position consisting of sister missionaries called to give leadership to other sister missionaries. Mission organization Organization in areas with stakes  Missions are organized in two parallel structures. The first is the organization of the missionaries. The mission president assigns missionary leaders to help him direct the work. Among the leadership assignments in the mission are assistants to the president, zone leaders, and district leaders. There are two or more missionaries who serve as assistants to the president (not to be confused with the counselors in the mission presidency). The assistants carry out the direction of the mission president in organizing the mission; assigning companionships and proselyting areas; and overseeing the welfare and training of the missionaries. In many missions a companionship of elders constitutes the zone leaders. However, there are also missions where only one elder is designated the zone leader and his companion holds no special designation. The zones may be geographically large or small, depending on the mission. The number of missionaries in a zone also varies widely. The zones are divided into districts, each being led by a missionary assigned as a district leader. A district usually has two to four missionary companionships. The zone leaders and district leaders train the missionaries, see after their welfare, conduct interviews, proselyte together, and share successes. In general, only single male missionaries serve as assistants, zone leaders, and district leaders, except in non-proselyting missions which only contain single female missionaries or missionary couples. The missionaries are responsible for preaching to the people in their own area. A mission's ecclesiastical line of authority is from the mission president down to the missionaries. The missionaries answer to the mission president directly, as opposed to the local branch president, bishop, or stake president. Organization in areas without stakes The other type of mission structure exists where there are no organized stakes of the church in an area due to a relatively small number of Latter-day Saints living in the area. This may be the result of the church being relatively new in an area or the church being established in a sparsely populated area of the world. In these stake-less areas, the mission president is the presiding local church authority and he is responsible for the welfare of all the members, not just the missionaries. The mission is divided into districts (not to be confused with the other type of district mentioned above) which serve much the same role as stakes do. Each district is assigned a district president who is usually a local resident; the district president reports directly to the mission presidency. The district presidency perform most of the day-to-day functions that a stake presidency would perform in a stake. Certain duties, such as the issuance of recommends to attend the temple, remain the sole prerogative of the mission president. Districts within a mission are composed exclusively of branches. After the membership has grown sufficiently, the branches may be converted into wards and the district may be converted into a stake. Typically, this will not occur until there are least five ward-sized congregations in the district. Once a district becomes a stake, the mission president is only responsible for the proselytizing missionaries in the area, not the local members of the church. Variations in size The LDS Church mission with the smallest geographic area (approximately 10 acres) is the Utah Salt Lake Temple Square Mission, in which missionaries from around the world serve on Temple Square, often to visitors from their own homelands. These missionaries serve at Temple Square, and occasionally serve in another mission in another part of the United States for a few months, then return to Temple Square for the final months of their 18-month mission call. Only female missionaries and older, retired couples are called to the Temple Square Mission. The mission with the largest geographical area is currently the Micronesia Guam Mission, which covers an area that is roughly the size of the continental United States. However, the vast majority of this mission is composed of empty ocean. The largest mission in terms of geographical land mass and population is currently the China Hong Kong Mission, which encompasses nearly all of the Chinese landmass and population. Outside of Hong Kong and Macau, there are no LDS missionaries in China. Prior to its split in November 2007 the India Bangalore Mission has the largest population amongst which proselytizing is allowed. This mission covers all of India, thus it has more than one billion inhabitants in its borders. It is unclear whether the New Delhi or Bangalore mission should now be considered to cover more inhabitants partly because the New Delhi mission covers Nepal, Bangladesh, and Pakistan as well as northern India, and outside of Northern India does little formal proselyting. Russia contains missions with very large areas. In the Russia Novosibirsk Mission, it is possible to take a 42-hour train ride to get to the city of Novosibirsk from some places within the mission boundaries. Special language assignments within missions Missionaries are sometimes called to serve in a particular mission, but with a non-standard language assignment.Listing of Vietnamese speaking missions in the US To cite some examples: Kentucky Louisville, Spanish speaking; California Anaheim, Vietnamese speaking; Canada Vancouver, Mandarin speaking; Illinois Chicago, Polish speaking.  Central church structure  The work of the missions is overseen by the Missionary Committee, which consists of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve. Much of the actual work of overseeing the missions is delegated to the Missionary Executive Council (MEC). This committee has roots in the Radio, Publicity and Missionary Literature Committee formed in the 1930s, with Stephen L. Richards as chair and Gordon B. Hinckley as executive secretary. In the late 1940s, Richards and Hinckley held the same positions, with Hinckley essentially fulfilling the duties later undertaken by the missionary department. By the early 1970s, the MEC consisted of Spencer W. Kimball, Hinckley, Thomas S. Monson and Bruce R. McConkie, all members of the Quorum of the Twelve.Loren C. Dunn, \\"A Mission Call\\", in New Era, July 1973 L. Tom Perry was chairman of the executive committee for several years in the late 2000s. He was then succeeded by Russell M. Nelson. As of August 2015, most of the current members are not known. However, membership has historically included at least two members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, one member of the Presiding Bishopric and the executive director of the church's Missionary Department, who is usually a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy. As of 1 August 2015, the executive director's identity is not known. Prior to August 2015, David F. Evans had been serving in this capacity.R. Lanie Britsch, \\"Missions and Missionary Organization\\" in A Firm Foundation: Church Organization and Administration, ed. David J. Whittaker and Arnold K. Garr (Provo: BYU Religious Studies Center, 2011) On 19 August 2015, it was announced that Bonnie L. Oscarson, the church's General Young Women President, had been invited to become the first female member of the MEC.. The church's Missionary Department works under the direction of the MEC. The Missionary Department does not develop policy, but oversees its implementation. It directs the missions of the church, along with the 15 Missionary Training Centers and the 20+ visitors' centers and historical sites the church operates.British, \\"Missions and Missionary Organization\\" History of missions Rudger Clawson and Joseph Standing (seated), missionaries of the LDS Church serving in the Southern States Mission in the United States, pose for a portrait in 1879. While still companions, Standing was killed by a mob of anti-Mormons on 21 July 1879 in Varnell Station, Georgia. The title of \\"First Mission\\" is normally given to the British Mission, today considered the lineal ancestor of the England London Mission. This was begun under the direction of Heber C. Kimball in 1837. Missionary work had previously occurred in the United States and Canada, but missionaries were not organized into specific missions. The work of this mission began in Preston, England, largely because one of the missionaries Joseph Fielding had a brother there who initially opened his chapel to the missionaries preaching. Later they often preached at the location also used by the Temperance Society. The first convert in the British Mission was George D. Watt, who would later be important in the compilation of the Journal of Discourses. Within the first year of missionary work the headquarters of this mission were moved to Manchester. In 1840 they were moved again to Liverpool, largely so the mission leaders could play a role in organizing the emigration of Latter-day Saints to America. In 1929 when the British Mission was separated from the European Mission, its headquarters were moved to Birmingham. The headquarters were moved to London in about 1930 since by this time the church was no longer encouraging Latter-day Saints to emigrate from Britain. United States and Canada Early missions Although the church's missionaries served in many parts of the Eastern United States of America from 1830 on, no mission was organized until 1839. In this year a mission was organized in New York City presided over by John P. Greene. However, at this time missionaries continued to serve outside of regular mission areas. With the removal of the main body of the Saints to Utah Territory and other western states, the number of church members in the Eastern United States was very small. As mission president of the Eastern States Mission, Wilford Woodruff tried to bring all the saints in New England and other eastern areas to move to Utah Territory. In 1854, after having been defunct for about three years, the Eastern States Mission was organized again. John Taylor presided over this mission. His main function was to publish a paper to disseminate the teachings of the church. The other thing he did was supervise immigration from Europe to Utah, being the first to meet the saints when they came out of Castle Garden. He did preside over the few Saints in New York City but did not functionally administer the church in any larger region. On the eve of the American Civil War missionary work made much progress in New York City as well as other eastern metropolises. However the call of the gathering to Utah, given more power by the preaching and leadership of Orson Pratt and Erastus Snow, caused many of the saints to \\"flee Babylon and gather to Zion\\". The advent of the U.S. Civil War and its connection in the minds of the Saints with Joseph Smith's prophecies on war caused the vast majority of the Saints to leave the eastern United States and gather to Utah Territory. During the 1850s the church also had an organization in St. Louis with first Erastus Snow and latter Orson Spencer having a regional leadership position somewhat equivalent to that of a mission president, although neither was referred to by this title while they presided from St. Louis. In the western United States families would be called on settlement missions, but these were not primarily proselytizing missions. Some started as missions to the Native Americans. One such was headed by Orson Hyde and tried to convert the Shoshone in Wyoming. The Southern Indian Mission, with Jacob Hamblin as its most famous missionary, made much progress. These missions were often directed by church leaders in regular wards and stakes and did not become an organized mission at this time. There were three more missions organized at this time in the United States as we define it today. The California Mission thrived for a short time with the presence of such men as Parley P. Pratt and George Q. Cannon. However, there were nearly as many men on gold-mining missions as regular proselytizing missions. By the time of the Utah War, the California Mission had largely stopped functioning. The Sandwich Islands Mission was begun in 1850. Among the first missionaries sent to what are now called the Hawaiian Islands was George Q. Cannon who converted Jonatana Napela. The two of them translated the Book of Mormon into Hawaiian, and the church was able to gain many native Hawaiian converts. The last antebellum mission was the Indian Territory Mission. Organized in 1855 with Henry W. Miller as president, this mission mainly focused on teaching the Cherokee in what is today Oklahoma. There were some converts made in the following five years, however, the mission was soon afterward disbanded. In 1865, John Taylor again organized the Eastern States Mission. However, this mission stopped functioning in 1869. Establishment of permanent missions The true advent of fully functioning missions, with missionaries functioning under a mission president, in the United States on a large and permanent scale can be dated to the organization of the Southern States Mission. This mission was started in 1876 with Henry G. Boyle as president. A short time later John Hamilton Morgan was made the president of this mission. The next mission to be organized was the Northern States Mission (initially called the Northwestern States Mission) with headquarters in Council Bluffs, Iowa. The first president of this mission was Cyrus H. Wheelock. Wheelock had served as a missionary in both Iowa and Michigan about this time. The mission was organized in 1878. It was renamed the Northern States Mission in 1889. The mission headquarters were moved to Chicago in 1896. In 1883, the Indian Territory Mission was reestablished with Matthew W. Dalton as president. In 1898 it was renamed the Southwestern States Mission, signifying it was not only teaching the Native Americans but everyone else in its jurisdiction who would listen. 1892 saw a mission organized in California. This marked the beginning of proselytizing there. John Dalton worked initially in Oakland and San Francisco. In 1893 Karl G. Maeser arrived as head of the Utah exhibit at the mid-winter fair in San Francisco. He also presided over the mission, focusing his efforts on gaining friends in the San Francisco Bay Area. Henry S. Tanner arrived the next August, with missionaries, thus he was able to preside over missionaries. The headquarters of the mission remained in San Francisco, but by August 1895 a branch had been organized in Los Angeles. That year also marked the division of the California mission into Conferences. In 1893, the Eastern States Mission was organized again. This is the first time the mission was a truly regional one, supervising missionary work throughout much of the eastern United States. By the 1890s, the leaders of the church were beginning to encourage converts to no longer gather to Utah. With more church members from Utah moving east for employment and education, a nucleus was building around which the church could grow. Still, most people were baptized by missionaries traveling without purse or scrip. Missions in the Western United States Unlike missions in the Eastern United States, in this period missions in the Western States were generally set up in areas into which church members had already begun to move. The origins of the Northwestern States Mission go back to the Oregon Lumber Company which was run by David Eccles and Charles W. Nibley. Many Latter-day Saints worked in the company's offices in Baker City, Oregon, and a branch was organized there in 1893. At that point this branch was part of the Oneida Stake headquartered in Preston, Idaho. In 1896 Edward Stevenson was appointed to go open a mission in Oregon, Montana and Washington. As a missionary Stevenson preached in Walla Walla, Washington, Spokane, Washington, Lewiston, Idaho and Baker City, Oregon. The Colorado and Montana Missions were created in 1896. When the Northwestern States Mission was formally organized in 1897 George C. Parkinson served as president. The Northwestern States and Montana Missions were merged in 1898, at which time Franklin Bramwell, who had been president of the Montana Mission, was made president of the new mission, the entire region now being called the Northwestern States Mission. The Northwestern States Mission was headquartered in Baker City, Oregon. However, when a stake was organized in Oregon in 1901 with Bramwell as president, the mission headquarters were moved to Portland, Oregon. The next year Nephi Pratt replaced Bramwell as mission president, and the mission moved toward a system of preaching the gospel in areas where Latter-day Saints were a minority. Missions in the early 20th century In 1900, the United States was divided into eight missions, with three whole states and parts of two others outside of all missions. The newly acquired Hawaiian Islands made a ninth mission in the United States. However, missionary work was not going on in the Philippines, Puerto Rico or any of the smaller areas the U.S. had acquired in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. *The Eastern States Mission encompassed New England, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia. This mission had its headquarters in Brooklyn, New York. It also included all of Ontario and the parts of Canada further east, though missionaries were only active in Ontario at this time. *The Southern States Mission covered Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina, Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky and Ohio. Ohio had been placed in this mission so there was a northern climate where missionaries could recover from illness. The Southern States Mission was headquartered in Chattanooga, Tennessee. *The Northern States Mission included Michigan, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Manitoba. It was headquartered in Chicago. *The Southwestern States Mission covered Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas. It was headquartered in St. John, Kansas. *The Colorado Mission covered North and South Dakota, Nebraska, the eastern two-thirds of Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico. It was headquartered in Denver. *The Northwestern States Mission included Montana, Northern Idaho, Oregon and Washington. It also included Western Canada; however, it would not be until 1902 that Nephi Pratt, president of the Northwestern States Mission and a son of Parley P. Pratt, would lead missionaries into British Columbia. Edward G. Cannon was going about the Nome, Alaska region with a tabernacle on wheels in which to hold church meetings, but he had no actual connection with a mission and had gone to Alaska on his own initiative to share the gospel. The Northwestern States mission was headquartered in Portland, Oregon *The last mission was the California Mission, which in 1900 had boundaries co-terminus with California. It was headquartered in Los Angeles. Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Southern Idaho and Western Wyoming, all areas which by that time had large Mormon populations, were not in any mission. Missionary work, to the extent that it occurred in these areas, was administered through the Home Missionary Program at the stake level. In 1902, the Middle States Mission was created with Ben E. Rich as president. However, in 1903, Ephraim H. Nye, president of the Southern States mission, died. He was replaced by Ben E. Rich and the boundaries of the missions were realigned. In 1904, the Southwestern States Mission was renamed the Central States Mission. After the San Francisco earthquake and fire in 1906, the mission headquarters was relocated to Los Angeles from San Francisco. In the next few years the headquarters of the Central States Mission were moved to Independence, Missouri, and the headquarters of the Northwestern States Mission were moved to Portland, Oregon. By 1907, the Colorado Mission was renamed the Western States Mission. Also in these years, the headquarters of the Southern States Mission moved from Chattanooga to Atlanta, Georgia. In 1919, the first major change to missions in more than 15 years occurred. Ontario, Manitoba and Qu√©bec were split from the Eastern States Mission and the Northern States Mission and organized as the Canadian Mission. In 1925, the North Central States Mission was organized with parts of the Western States, Northern States, and Canadian Missions included. In 1926, Ohio was transferred to the Northern States Mission.Deseret News Church Almanac, 2006 ed., p. 243 To get a sense of how large these missions were, in 1922 part of southwest New Mexico was added to the jurisdiction of the California mission. Central States Mission history The Missouri Independence Mission is one of the oldest missions. Its history goes back to 1855. In the 1855 General Conference the church called missionaries to the Indian Territory. They worked primarily with the Cherokee and the Creeks. There were also several converts made among the followers of Lyman Wight some of whom by that time were residing in Oklahoma. At the end of the year a company of 65 left for Utah. Early church apostle Parley P. Pratt was killed in the mission near Alma, Arkansas in 1857. An early leader of the mission here was Henry Eyring, who presided 1858 to 1860. Eyring was an ancestor of the scientist Henry Eyring and apostle Henry B. Eyring. In 1859 all except Eyring were expelled by Indian Agents as an outgrowth of the Utah War. With Eyring's departure the following year little missionary work occurred until 1877 when Matthew Dalton and John Hubbard served in the Indian Territory. The mission was non-existent again for six years until George Teasdale and Matthew Dalton reopened the work in 1883. Teasdale wrote several tracks at this time. In 1885 Andrew Kimball, the father of church president Spencer W. Kimball, became the president of the mission. Under his leadership the mission expanded to include Kansas, Arkansas and Texas in its domain. The headquarters were by the time he was released from this position in 1897 at St. John, Kansas. In 1900 the headquarters were still at St. John. In October 1900 Louisiana and Missouri were added to the mission. Earlier that year James G. Duffin became president of the mission. He presided over the organization of a colony of Latter-day Saints at Kelsey, Upshur County, Texas. There were also church colonies established in the vicinity of Poynor, Henderson County, Texas and Spurger, Tyler County, Texas. In 1904 the name of the mission was changed to the Central States Mission. In 1906 Samuel O. Bennion became president of the mission. In that same year the mission headquarters were moved to Independence, Missouri. Independence soon developed into the publication headquarters for the missions of the church in the United States. the mission operated Zion's Printing and Publishing Company which published Liahona the Elders Journal as well as many books and tracts. In the 1910s Spencer W. Kimball served as a missionary in the Central States Mission. In 1930 there were twelve districts in the Central States mission, the Arkansas, East Kansas, East Texas, Independence, Louisiana, Missouri, North Texas, Oklahoma, South Texas, Southwest Missouri, West Kansas and West Texas. President Bennion was called to the First Council of the Seventy in 1933, but he continued to serve as president of the Central States Mission until 1935. The modern mission generally corresponds to the Independence and East Kansas Districts of 1930. In 1931 the Texas Mission was split off from the Southern area of the Central States Mission.2006 Church Almanac. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Morning News) p. 488 In 1974 the mission was renamed the Missouri Independence Mission. All missions were renamed in 1974 going from a system that tried to identify missions by a generalized notation of the location to naming them after the city in which they were headquartered. Later, some missions such as the Baltic State Mission and the Alpine German Speaking Mission were created that moved away from this format, but as of 2010 over 99% of missions worldwide had names in the country/city or state/city format. Early 20th century growth of the Northwestern States Mission From 1902 to 1909 Nephi Pratt served as the president of the mission. He was succeeded by Melvin J. Ballard. Among Ballard's successors in the 1920s was Brigham S. Young, a son of Brigham Young Jr. and a grandson of Brigham Young and Orson Spencer. During the ten years Ballard was president the mission began teaching groups of Native Americans within its boundaries. By 1930 there were nine church-owned chapels as well as 23 organized branches in the mission. The mission did not include any organized stake. Missionary efforts had been extended into British Columbia and Alaska, although there was only one branch in British Columbia and no branches in Alaska. Mission field versus stakes Early on in church history, a general dichotomy grew up where the \\"mission field\\" was viewed as a separate area from the stakes of the church. This line began to blur in the 1920s. With the organization of stakes in California, the mission still sent missionaries into those areas although it no longer had jurisdiction over the local units. East Central States Mission history The ancestor of the current Kentucky Louisville Mission was the East Central States Mission. It was organized in November 1928. It took in Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia from the Southern States Mission and West Virginia and part of Maryland from the Eastern States Mission. Miles L. Jones, the new mission president, set up headquarters at Louisville. By 1930 the Mission had eight districts, the Kentucky, East Kentucky, North Carolina, East Tennessee, Middle Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia North and West Virginia South Districts. Post‚ÄìSecond World War expansion Two missionaries of The Church of Jesus-Christ of Latter-day Saints in 2008. In 1945 there were the following missions in the United States:2006 Church Almanac. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Morning News) p. 484-489 *Northern California (organized 1942) *Navajo-Zuni (organized 1943) *New England (organized 1937) *Spanish-American (organized 1936) *Texas (organized 1931) *East Central States *North Central States *Northwestern States *Western States *Central States *Southern States *Eastern States *Northern States In May 1945 the Texas Mission was renamed the Texas Louisiana Mission. In October 1947 the Central Atlantic States Mission was formed from the East Central States Mission. This mission was headquartered at Roanoke, Virginia.2006 Church Almanac. p. 274 In 1970 this mission was renamed the North Carolina- Virginia Mission. In 1974 it became the Virginia Roanoke Mission. It was renamed the Virginia Richmond Mission in February 1992 and currently has its headquarters in Richmond.Church Almanac. p. 275, 489 In 1949 the Great Lakes Mission was organized, consisting of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio. The West Central States mission was organized in 1950, consisting primarily of Montana and Wyoming. There was then a break until a new mission was organized in the United States. There was no new mission organized in the United States for almost eight years after this. The general plan of having \\"states\\" in the various mission names was expanded when in 1955 the Texas-Louisiana Mission was renamed the Gulf States Mission.2006 Church Almanac. p. 488 In March 1958 the West Spanish-American Mission was organized. In October 1960 the Eastern Atlantic States Mission was organized with George B. Hill as president. This mission included the District of Columbia, Maryland, Delaware and southern New Jersey. This was the last new mission formed with \\"states\\" in its name. The next month the Florida Mission was organized with Karl R. Lyman as president. In February 1961 a new Texas Mission was split off from the Gulf States Mission. In 1964 the Cumorah Mission was organized from the Eastern States Mission. Headquartered in Rochester, New York this showed that the \\"states\\" naming of missions was doomed. This mission would be renamed New York Rochester in 1974. This year also saw the organization of the Northern Indian Mission, organized from the Southwest Indian Mission, formerly the Navajo-Zuni Mission. This was the heyday of separate missions organized to proselyte with specific linguistic and ethnic groups. The California South Mission was formed in June 1966. 1967 saw two new missions that showed that \\"states\\" no longer made sense with missions since it was becoming true that missions often covered no more than one state. The Ohio Mission was organized from the Great Lakes Mission and the Texas South Mission was organized from the Texas and the Spanish-American missions. 1967 also saw the rest of the Spanish American Mission put in the Western States and Texas Missions. A decision had been made to have missionaries assigned to missions by area and not language. The full effects of this decision would not been seen for a few more years. On the 1st day of 1968 the Pacific Northwest Mission was organized. This made it so the Northwestern States mission was essential Oregon and adjacent parts of Idaho and the Pacific Northwest Mission was Washington with neighboring portions of Idaho. Salt Lake City was first included in a regular mission in 1975. This was with the organization of the Utah Salt Lake City Mission. Latin America The first mission in Latin America was an attempt in the 1850s by Parley P. Pratt to preach in Chile. He made no progress and did not make a permanent impact.2010 Church Almanac: Chile It was not until the 1870s, after Meliton Trejo and Daniel Jones had translated the Book of Mormon into Spanish that missionary work began on a permanent footing in Mexico. The first mission president there was Moses Thatcher. Another early mission president in that land was Helaman Pratt, son of Parley and father of Rey Pratt. The first permanent mission in South America was formed in 1925 under the direction of Melvin J. Ballard. Missionary work in Central America began in the late 1940s under the supervision of the Mexican Mission. A separate Central American Mission was organized in November 1952. In 1956 Mexican Mission was again divided with the Northern Mexican Mission being formed. A third mission was organized in 1960, this time by splitting the Northern Mexican mission and forming the West Mexican Mission, which would latter become the Mexico Hermosillo Mission.2006 Church Almanac. p. 491 Europe After the initial opening of the British Mission it would be over ten years before missions would open in continental Europe. Although a missionary was sent to Germany in 1840 and Orson Hyde traveled across Europe in the early 1840s, it would not be until after the Latter-day Saints had gone to the Salt Lake Valley that missions would be established in Europe. In October General Conference of 1849 three apostles were called to open missionary work in Europe. Erastus Snow was assigned to open missionary work in Scandinavia.Deseret News Church Almanac, 2007 ed. p. 345 The other two assignments were for Lorenzo Snow to go to Italy and John Taylor to go to France. There were other elders assigned to accompany each of these apostles, so a mission organization was in place even before any missionaries had reached their destinations. The French mission came to include the Channel Islands under John Taylor's direction, and this was where the mission saw the most converts in the early days. A few years later one of Taylor's converts, Louis Bertrand, returned to the mission and organized a Mormon newspaper out of Paris. He had little success in winning converts. The Scandinavian mission came to encompass Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Iceland. The Italian mission, despite the presence of Joseph Toronto, was largely confined to northern Italy among the Waldensians. Lorenzo Snow also supervised the opening of the Swiss Mission. This mission eventually became the Swiss- Italian-German mission a few years later, and then \\"Italian\\" was dropped from the name since no missionary work was going on in Italy. Missionary work in Portugal began after the Portuguese Revolution of 1974. David M. Kennedy was a special representative of the church who visited with Portuguese officials in Lisbon during August 1974. These officials granted Kennedy's request to establish the church in Portugal and to allow missionaries to enter the country. The Portuguese Parliament passed a law in November 1974 granting freedom of religion. Soon after, the church organized the Portugal Lisbon Mission, with William Grant Bangerter as the mission president.Information comes from a recorded interview with Kennedy, conducted in 1977 by Spencer J. Palmer of Brigham Young University. Copies of a nine-page written version of the recording are in the possession of several former church leaders in Portugal, including Allen K. Coryell, who was president of the Portugal Lisbon Mission from 1978 to 1981. ~~~~ Oceania The first missionaries to the Pacific Islands went to French Polynesia in 1844. These missionaries had much success in baptizing converts, but there were only three missionaries so no fully functioning organization was needed. Addison Pratt was designated the mission president, but the missionaries made decisions jointly on where to labor. In 1850 a mission was organized in Hawaii. Here there was also a designated mission president, and there were enough missionaries to make it a clear process of assigning missionaries to specific areas. However, each area was an island, and the number of missionaries in each area varied. Beyond this, the decision to go from teaching in English to American and English sailors temporarily on the islands and other expatriates to teaching the natives in the Hawaiian Language was made by George Q. Cannon, who was not the mission president. Although some British Latter-day Saints on their way to Australia were set apart as missionaries in the early 1840s, missionary work on an organized basis did not begin there until the arrival of John Murdock and Charles Wandell in 1851.Deseret News Church Alamanc, 2007 ed., p. 297 International Mission In 1973, the church created the International Mission and gave it responsibility for all areas of the world not otherwise assigned to organized missions.\\"International Mission Established to Serve Remote Areas of Globe\\", Ensign, February 1973.\\"The Ends of the Earth: A Conversation about the New International Mission\\", Ensign, April 1974. Its purpose was the dissemination of church materials to correspondents who did not reside in organized missions. As the missionary work has expanded, the role of the International Mission has been superseded, and it was closed in about 1989. Africa The first mission in Africa was the South African Mission, originally organized in 1851. This became the South Africa Cape Town and South Africa Johannesburg missions in 1985. Later, the South Africa Durban Mission was created from portions of these missions as well as other regions in southern Africa. West Africa There were attempts to open a mission in Nigeria in the 1960s. However the church decided against proceeding with these plans. After the 1978 revelation extending the priesthood to all worthy males was received, the church proceeded to open missions in West Africa. Initially the focus was on Ghana and Nigeria, where there were groups that with unofficial church members who had been for years begging the church to send missionaries. Initially the missionaries sent to these nations were organized in the International Mission. As missionary work in these areas progressed they were organized as the West African Mission in 1981. French- speaking areas of Africa were originally organized into a separate Cameroon Yaounde Mission in 1991. The original plan was to have the mission cover a broad range of French speaking areas. However, after a short time it was decided to initially focus on building up the church in C√¥te d'Ivoire, and so the mission headquarters was moved to Abidjan. Asia The Japanese mission was split in 1968, with the mission headquartered in Tokyo retaining that name while a new mission was organized based in southern Japan that was designated the Japan-Okinawa Mission. The new mission was headed by Edward Y. Okazaki, a Japanese-American, along with his Japanese-American wife Chieko N. Okazaki. This mission was split again two years later. The Japan Central Mission was organized with headquarters in Kobe and with Okazaki continuing as president of that mission. The Japan West Mission was also organized at this time with headquarters in Fukuoka.history of Japan Fukuoka Mission Reunions Many missionaries working together build strong bonds of friendship, and for a few years after their missions are over, a former mission president will host reunions of missionaries who served during his tenure. As the missionaries come from many different parts of the world, it is common that the reunions are held in Utah, especially during church general conference weekends, as it provides for the probability of the largest number of attendees. Several web sites have been created by church members with the express purpose of allowing mission alumni to keep in contact.

The word autacoid comes from the Greek \\"autos\\" (self) and \\"acos\\" (relief; i.e., drug). The effects of autacoids are primarily local, though large quantities can be produced and moved into circulation. Autacoids may thus have systemic effects by being transported via the circulation. These regulating molecules are also metabolized locally. In sum, these compounds typically are produced locally, act locally and are metabolized locally. Autacoids can have a variety of different biological actions, including modulating the activities of smooth muscles, glands, nerves, platelets and other tissues. Some autacoids are chiefly characterized by the effect they have on specific tissues, such as smooth muscle. With respect to vascular smooth muscle, there exist both vasoconstrictor and vasodilator autacoids. Vasodilator autacoids are released during periods of exercise. Their main effect is seen in the skin, where they facilitate heat loss. These are local hormones; they therefore have a paracrine effect. Some notable autacoids are: eicosanoids, angiotensin, neurotensin, NO (nitric oxide), kinins, histamine, serotonin, endothelins and palmitoylethanolamide. In 2015, a new definition of autacoids was proposed, which helps to more specifically describe Autacoid Medicine: '‚ÄúAutacoids are a locally produced modulating factors, influencing locally the function of cells and/or tissues, which are produced on demand and which subsequently are metabolized in the same cells and/or tissues\\".

They are sometimes seen in the marine aquarium trade. Description Dried specimen. A group of knobby sea stars in Malaysia. Dried sea stars for touristic trade in Philippines. P. nodosus possess rows of spines or \\"horns\\"; black conical points arranged in a single row, radially on the dorsal side, which may erode and become blunt. These dark protrusions are used to scare away possible predators, by looking frightening or dangerous. On the ventral side, tube feet, purple in color (or pale, transparent pink), are arranged in rows on each arm. Most horned sea stars found are a roughly rigid five-pointed star-shape with tapering arms to the end, although there are anomalies like four or six-armed specimens; they may grow up to in diameter. The sea stars are usually colored in shades of red or brown, but can be light tan, the color of cookie dough. This appearance, combined with the small horns on its dorsal side, give the sea star a look similar to that of a bumpy cookie. Image:Horned Sea Star, Bunaken Island.jpg Image:Protoreaster nodosus.jpg Image:Protoreaster nodosus 2.jpgOral face Habitat and behavior Horned sea stars prefer sheltered, sandy or slightly muddy bottoms more than hard substrata such as coral reef, and are frequently sighted conspicuously between the leaves of seagrasses on sea grass meadows or on blank stretch of coral sand. In shallow water, this species can be seen intertidally, occasionally exposed to the low tide. They do not withstand rapid changes well, however, and usually keep themselves underwater. Sometimes, many individuals of this species can be seen gathering on soft bottom with reason not very well known, probably to increase the chance of fertilization when spawning or simply a suitable feeding ground. Horned sea stars seem to be opportunistic carnivores; adults are known to prey on most sessile life forms including hard corals and sponges in aquarium. In this same setting, they will hunt down snails and eat them. An individual of horned sea star also has been observed eating a sea urchin in their natural habitat. Gremli MS, Newman HE, Insight Guides Underwater: Marine Life In the South China Sea, page 159. APA Publications GmbH & Co. Verlag KG., 1993 As with other tropical echinoderms, commensal animals like shrimps (of genus Periclimenes), tiny brittle stars and even juvenile filefish can be found on the surfaces of a horned sea star. This may be attributed to its protective nature, as there are few predators that would dare to eat this echinoderm. Human relations Overharvesting In many tropical Asian and Pacific countries, horned sea stars are collected for sea shell trade for their ornate skeletons. In some areas overharvesting is an issue and reduces greatly the population of the echinoderms. A related species, the Atlantic Oreaster reticulatus, commonly known as Bahama Sea Star, is also a once-abundant species reduced in number due to the continuous harvesting by the industry and tourists alike.

Together with the pertussis toxin it is the most important virulence factor of the causative agent of whooping cough, Bordetella pertussis. Bordetella bronchiseptica and Bordetella parapertussis, also able to cause pertussis-like symptoms, also produce adenylate cyclase toxin. It is a toxin secreted by the bacteria to influence the host immune system.  Structure  Adenylate cyclase toxin from Bordetella pertussis is a 1706 amino acid residue long protein. The protein consists of three domains: from the N-terminus up to roughly residue 400, there is an adenylate-cyclase domain; between residues 500 and 700, there is a hydrophobic domain; and from residue 1000 to the C-terminus, there are calcium binding repeats. Two acylation sites are located at lysine residues K860 and K983. The part of the toxin from residue 400 to the C-terminus, called hemolysin, is structurally related to a large family of bacterial toxins - RTX toxins. Differences between the toxins of different Bordetella species are mainly in the calcium-binding domain.  Folding and secretion  The toxin is secreted by the Type I secretion system, which spans both membranes and periplasm space, allowing the toxin to be secreted from the cytoplasm straight outside the cell. A large proportion of the toxin remains associated with the bacterium exterior proteins, mainly filamentous haemagglutinin, but these toxin molecules are not active. Besides attachment to bacterial proteins, aggregation also inactivates the toxin. This quick inactivation highlights the necessity of close contact between secreting bacterium and target cell.  RTX toxins  RTX stands for 'repeats in toxins,' but not all members of the family are toxins. Repeating aspartate and glycine rich nonapeptides (repeats 9 amino acids long) are a characteristic feature of this family of proteins, and are able to bind calcium ions. A feature of the RTX proteins is their ability to form pores in cell membranes, allowing ions to leak. This may manifest as a hemolytic activity on erythrocytes, leading to this group of toxins being called 'hemolysins'. The cell types which are vulnerable to this pore-forming activity varies among the toxins. The acylation of lysines is required for the pore-forming cytotoxic effects of all the RTX proteins. Toxins from many known gram-negative pathogenic bacteria are in the RTX family. An example is Œ±-hemolysin from Escherichia coli or RtxA from Vibrio cholerae.  Function   Molecular mechanisms  Adenylate cyclese toxin binds to target cells by the complement receptor 3 (CD11b/CD18, or Mac-1). Target cell are therefore myeloid lineage cells, mainly phagocytes, such as neutrophils. Binding to cells without the CR3 also happens, but at a much lower rate. The portion responsible for binding to the receptor is inside the calcium binding repeats, from residues 1166 to 1287. The hemolysin portion of the protein then binds to the target membrane and inserts itself into the bilayer. The adenylate cyclase (AC) domain is then translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm. Translocation of the AC domain is independent of cytotoxic pore- forming activity, as these two activities require to toxin to adopt different conformations. The transiently opened pores do, however, contribute to AC domain function by potassium leakage and calcium influx into the target cell, which slows endocytosis of CR3/adenylate cyclase toxin clusters, also, the CR3/toxin complex is mobilized by detachment from the cytoskeleton. The complex is then recruited into cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. Calcium influx by itself has many negative effects on target cells, such as deregulation of cellular signalling. The adenylate cyclase domain has intrinsic enzymatic activity. Translocation of the AC domain into the cell starts the main process by which this toxin influences target cells: the AC domain binds calmodulin, and catalyzes unregulated production of cAMP from ATP. cAMP is an important second messenger molecule and its massive overproduction affects many cellular processes. In phagocytes, most of the bactericidal functions are stopped by cAMP-mediated activation of PKA and Epac.  Effect on target cells  The above described effects of the adenylate cyclase toxin, mainly the cAMP overproduction, have a profound effect on target cells. Although phagocytic immune cells migrate to the site of infection in the lungs, they are not able to mount an effective response. Not only the phagocytic uptake of bacteria is blocked, but subsequent production of ROS by neutrophils and monocytes, NETs by neutrophils, and NO by macrophages, is also inhibited. The effect on neutrophils is most important in early infection with Bordetella, impairing most of their antimicrobial functions. Intoxication with the adenylate cyclase toxin leads to shift in polarization of macrophages from M1 (proinflammatory) phenotype to M2 (immunoregulatory) phenotype and may lead to macrophage apoptosis. cAMP accumulation after adenylate cyclase intoxication also interferes with IRF signalling in dendritic cells, which leads to lower IL-12 production. IL-12 is important for T-cell response polarization. Other effects of cAMP on dendritic cell interaction with T-cells are also detrimental to the immune response. Although cAMP induces dendritic cell migration into lymph nodes, it lowers their capacity to interact with T-cells and present antigen. This has a tolerogenic effect on the T-cell population.  Pertussis vaccination  Vaccination against Bordetella pertussis is used in infancy to prevent whooping cough. The recent switch from whole-cell pertussis vaccine to acellular component vaccine in many countries has led to the fact that adenylate cyclase toxin is not present in most vaccines. Although not included in current vaccines, research shows that immunization with adenylate cyclase toxin elicits neutralizing antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies can block binding of the toxin to CR3. Antobodies against adenylate cyclase toxin are also present in the serum of humans infected with B. pertussis. Adenylate cyclase toxin based constructs have been proven to elicit the production of neutralizing antibodies, but lack the cytotoxicity associated with the complete toxin. Genetically detoxified adenylate cyclase toxin also serves in promoting the Th1/Th17 response, acting as an adjuvant.  Other roles for adenylate cyclase toxin  Adenylate cyclase toxin, or its parts, also serve as a tool for cell biologists. The AC domain finds use as a reporter protein. This reporter activity is based on activating cAMP production if translocated into a cell, conjugated to a studied protein. The AC domain consists of two subdomains, both are required for cAMP production. Conjugating each subdomain to a different protein allows protein-protein interactions to be studied, because cAMP production indicates close interaction of the proteins. Similarly, the two subdomains can be linked by a studied protein, which is then digested by proteases. Loss of cAMP production indicates cleavage by protease.

It is the administrative center of Tharad taluka. Tharad is near the border of Gujarat, 40 km from the border with Pakistan and 15 km from the Indian state of Rajasthan. The town was a princely state ruled by the Vaghela koliy Rajputs,\\"http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/ips/t/tharad.html\\" and the majority of its population follow the religion of Hinduism. Its main industries are agriculture and diamond polishing. It is one of the first major towns in Gujarat on National Highway 15. History The verse, dohra, about the founding of Tharad, states that in 115 (S. 171) Tharpar Parmar, leaving Shripur or Bhinmal in Marwad, went to the west and established the city of Tharad. The town continued in the hands of the Parmars till the tenth century, when it was taken by Chaulukya king Mularaja (). Tharad is said to have originally belonged to Parmar Rajputs, and many Parmars of the Suvar and Kalma clans were found in subordinate positions in the Tharad villages during British period. According to a Jain account, the last of the Parmar line became a convert to the Jainism, and resigned his chiefdom to his sister's son, the Chauhan Saregogji Ratansingji of Nadol, an ancestor of the Rana of Vav, in 1275 (Samvat 1331). Others say that the Chauhan killed his maternal uncle and usurped the chiefdom. The Chauhans, with the title of Rana, ruled at Tharad for about six generations, till, in the reign of Rana Punjaji, they were attacked by the Muslims, their capital stormed, and their chief slain. Another account says that the Chauhan Rajputs were driven out by the Rathods of Jodhpur, who were succeeded by the Muslims in fifteenth century. Henceforward Tharad was held by Muslim rulers and for several generations a family with the patronymic Multani ruled as proprietors, Jagirdars, and commandants, Thandars. As civil administrators of an isolated crown holding, they were invested with the title of Diwan which was continued during British period. This Muslim conquest probably took place in the reign, either of Muhammad Shahab-ud-din Ghori (1174-1206) or of Kutbud-din Aibak (1206-1210). In the later monarch's reign, the change of capital from Lahore to Delhi, and his numerous wars, made the Multani family's position very difficult. That they were able to hold their own was due to the aid of a family of Naiks, who, originally Chauhans, had become converts to Islam. In return for their services, the Naik family received the grant of several villages which they held till British period. At this time the smaller estates were chiefly in the hands of vassals of the Gohil and Parmar clans. Kubhara and Ledan were held by Chauhans; Duva, Roha, and Tithgam by the Bhildia Vaghelas of Bhildigad ; Eta Village and other villages by the descendants of Chibhadiya Brahmins who held them from the Rathods of Kanauj, and the rest by owners of whom scarce a trace remains. After the Muslim conquest of Tharad, the wife of Rana Punjaji, a Sodhi by caste, fled with her infant son to her father's house at Parkar. On growing up, her son Vajoji, returning to Tharad in 1244 built a stepwell, vav, and, successfully beating off the attacks of the Multanis, took the title of Rana, and, after his well, called his town Vav. His descendants rule there till British period. Compared with that of the Multani family, the cause of the Vav Rana was popular, and though for fear of drawing on themselves the army of the Patan governor, they dared not attempt to win back Tharad, they slowly spread their rule over many of the smaller holdings, and built up a fairly powerful chiefdom. Their cadets gradually won back many of the Tharad holdings, turning out the Gohil Suvar and Kalma Rajputs, but continuing to hold their estates from Tharad whose ruler they probably propitiated with gifts, nazaranas. In this way most of the smaller Tharad fiefs fell into the hands of Nadola Chauhans, cadets of the Vav house or of the old Ranas of Tharad by whom they are still held. On the rise of the Gujarat Sultanate (1403), the Multani family became their vassals. Later on Fateh Khan Baloch, one of the chief Gujarat nobles, held Tervada and Radhanpur, ousting the Multani family who sank into obscurity, and hold only the Tharad village of Kothigam by the end of British period. When, about 1700, the Jhalori family were driven from Jhalor and settled at Palanpur, Firoz Khan Jhalori obtained the chief power at Tharad. This lasted only a short time. About 1730, Tharad was given to Jawan Mard Khan Babi of Radhanpur State. Very soon after, when Abhaysinh of Jodhpur (1730 - 1737) was Viceroy, the Babi was turned out, and in his place a deputy was stationed at Tharad. The next ruler of Tharad was Chauhan Jetmalji, a cadet of the Vav house, who established himself there in 1736. In the following year, Rana Vajrajji, the head of the Vav house, fearing that Jetmalji might prove a dangerous rival, invited Bahadur Khan of Palanpur to oust him. Bahadur Khan agreed, and, driving out Jetmalji, kept the chiefship in his own hands. Within a few years (about 1740), the district was given either as an estate, jaghirdari, or as a charge, faujdari, to Nawab Kamal-ud-din Khan, till, in 1759, he handed it over to Vaghela Kanji, chief of Morvada, one of the supporters of the Babi family. This Kanji belonged to the Sardhara branch of the Vaghela tribe who took their name from the conquest of Sardhargadh in Saurashtra. This fortress, conquered by Vaghela Muluji from Churasam Bhim, was held by the Vaghelas for three generations. Then Vaghela Lunaji was expelled by Vibhojt, the head of the Jadeja house of Rajkot. Lunaji conquered Radhanpur, Varihi, Khorda, Santalpur, and Gidi in Kutch. In 1479 (Samvat 1535) one of his descendants, Rana Visal Dev, conquered Morvada, slaying its Chavad chief Magaji, and since then Kanji's forefathers have held Morvada. Kanji, before his death (1786), succeeded in making himself independent of his former patron. He was succeeded by his brother Harbhamji. About this time (1819), Tharad being much harassed and almost unpeopled by the raids of Khosas and other desert plunderers, the chief Harbhamji approached the British. In 1820, after the Khosas bad been driven out, the chief entered into an agreement with the British and Gaekwad on 14 February 1821 and became protectorate. In 1823 Harbhamji died and was succeeded by Karansing. In 1859 Karansing died and was succeeded by Khengarsing. Khengarsig died in 1892 and was succeeded by Abhaising who died in 1910. His successor Daulatsinh ruled from 1910 to 1921 when he died. Bimsinhji succeeded him and ruled until independence of India in 1947. Tharad was under Palanpur Agency of Bombay Presidency, which in 1925 became the Banas Kantha Agency. After Independence of India in 1947, Bombay Presidency was reorganized in Bombay State. When Gujarat state was formed in 1960 from Bombay State, it fell under Banaskantha district of Gujarat. Places of interest Nandevi Temple Outside the town, there is an old Hindu temple with an illegible inscription cut in stone. According to the local story, about 700 years ago before Chauhan Ratansing was driven out of Nadol, his family goddess Ashapura commanded him to leave Nadol, and, going westward, to settle in a place where the rope of his wagon should break. Starting off, the rope broke near Tharad. Here he stopped, and, in time, subduing the country round built a temple, calling it in honour of his goddess Nan Devi. The original shrine was probably built in 12th century by Ratansing.

They are contained within clusters of sticky threads called Cuvierian tubules which are expelled from the sea cucumber as a mode of self-defence. The holothurins belong to the class of compounds known as saponins and are anionic surfactants which can cause red blood cells to rupture. The holothurins can be toxic to humans if ingested in high amounts. Pharmacology Effects on nerves Holothurin is shown to have a blocking effect on nerves in desheathed bullfrog sciatic nerve and rat phrenic nerve preparations, and its potency can be compared to that of cocaine, procaine, and physostigmine. Unlike the other mentioned blocking agents, the disrupting effect of holothurin appears to be quite irreversible upon washing. In another experiment on frog sciatic nerve, holothurin A is shown to be capable of destroying electrical excitability of a node of Ranvier along with basophilic macromolecular material found in and near the cytoplasm of the node. In another experiment on rat phrenic nerve, the nerve-disrupting effect of holothurin A is found to be preventable when specific concentrations of physostigmine are present. Other effects Holothurin A and holothurin A1, along with other sea cucumber saponins, are found to reduce weight gain in mice. They improve glucose tolerance, reduce levels of lipids in blood and liver, and inhibit the absorption of lipids in the intestine. They also inhibit the activity of pancreatic lipase, decrease the growth of white adipocytes, a factor which contributes to obesity, and stimulate the production of LXR-Œ≤ nuclear receptor and ABCA1 protein. These findings suggest a possibility of the holothurins and other sea cucumber saponins being used in the development of anti-obesity drug. The holothurins are shown to have anti- melanogenic and anti-wrinkling effects on human skin by inhibiting melanin production in Melan-A cells and promoting collagen production in human dermal fibroblasts via the ERK pathway.

FCT aims to work with wider organizations such as UNCED to concentrate on economic and tourist activity in Barbados that is based on sustainable development for future generations on the island, the region and the wider world. As of September 2009, the organisation is chaired by Mrs Vivian-Anne Gittens and pays specific attention to the education of children in the environment of Barbados. Significance and focus The Future Centre Trust is acknowledged in Barbados as an important group for sustainable development on the island, and is a significant contributor to political decisions over environmental issues in Barbados as they are actively involved in the process of decision- making and working on multi-sectoral committees. The Future Centre Trust is particularly involved in issues such as the regulation, proposal and planning of eco-farming, permaculture, composting to create a more efficient waste scheme on the island, alternative energy, gray water reuse, and other environmental development issues. History The Centre was established in 1996 following the 1994 UN Conference on Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, hosted by Barbados. It began as an initial seventeen-day exhibition entitled \\"Village of Hope\\" and it came under the patronage of the Governor General, and later under the President of the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). More than 1,000 volunteers collaborated to build the initial environmental village which displayed 3,000 exhibits during the conference. The massive success of the display which was attended by 40,000 people inspired one of the organisers, a local agronomist, the late Colin Hudson, to take the matter further and pursue a permanent environmental group and exhibition centre. Hudson contacted the late Dame Nita Barrow to propose the new trust and it was given the seal of approval. In 1996, six trustees and a membership board of eight established the Future Centre Trust and the physical location of the Future Centre, inspired by the success of the exhibition. On establishment, its official declared mission was \\"to create a permanent stimulus to enhance the quality of life in Barbados and eventually establish Barbados as a role model in the fight to save our planet\\". In 1998, the Future Centre conducted a project in collaboration with the Recycling Council of Alberta in Canada, a project which explored recycling technology. They have also helped funding of the Dominica Conservation Association. In January 2000, the trust was contacted by Counterpart International, the sustainable development organization based in Washington, D.C. and an international link was created with the association. By May 2001, the trust had become fully incorporated into the Counterpart Caribbean organisation which operated for some eight further years until December 2009. Between May 17 and 20, 2007, Counterpart Caribbean met in San Juan, Puerto Rico, with environmental groups in the wider area of the Americas with groups from North America and elsewhere in the Caribbean to discuss sustainable tourism. A number of notable figures in the Caribbean region attended the event including Chairman of the Caribbean Tourism Organisation (CTO), Senator Allen Chastanet, who is the current Minister of Tourism and Civil Aviation in St. Lucia, Puerto Rico Tourism Company's executive director, Terestella Gonz√°lez Denton, and the president of the Caribbean Hotel Association (CHA), Peter Odle. Together with the Centre for Resource Management and Environmental Studies (CERMES) of the University of the West Indies, and the Sustainable Grenadines Project (SGP), the Counterpart Caribbean group also successfully implemented the Grenadines Water Taxi Project transboundary planning workshop in Carriacou in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The project was primarily funded by the Global Environmental Facility, with small grants from The European Commission. Function The Future Centre Trust operates in what they term as the \\"Initiatives of Hope\\". The trust has a number of initiatives, ranging from weekly national and local newspaper articles, radio interviews, school seminars and focused presentations, to meetings with government councils, operatives and other NGOs at ranging levels. The organization participated in a regular column focused on environmental matters in the magazine \\"Select Barbados\\", up until its cessation of business in May 2009. The magazine was published monthly and the organization had featured in the publication for the year of April 2008 until May 2009. The Trust relies on donations and volunteers to keep it operating and to enable projects to be developed and undertaken. They welcome contributions from individuals and corporate entities of time and/or finance as appropriate. The Trust has paid special attention to educating the important people of the future, the children, about the environment. Over the years it has held a notable exhibition centre located at Edge Hill, St. Thomas Parish in the Edgehill Plantation House. The centre is open for viewing by appointment, for a nominal charge. The Centre is dedicated to educating children and tourists about ecological science and the importance of conservation for future generations and in doing so raises several aspects of the social, cultural, economic and spiritual aspects of Barbados. The displays provide a number of exhibits demonstrating ecological footprint for example, eco-farming, alternative energy types, water conservation and has a number of plants and a herb garden. The exhibits include practical demonstrations on the loss of biological diversity, global warming, genetic engineering of food, nature conservation, fresh water access, sustainable tourism, coastal erosion and many other environmental issues. The group has been highly active in organising and collaborating with other groups to set up various workshops across the Caribbean islands in a diversity of different environmental issues. In November 2008, the organisation along with the Commonwealth Foundation, the Sandwatch Foundation, and the Barbados Youth Environment Programme provided a workshop entitled \\"‚ÄúYouth and Climate Change: Cool Youth Leading the Way.‚Äù on climate change which involved a high number of the Caribbean islands including Bahamas, Barbados, British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Guyana, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago.‚Äù Counterpart Caribbean therefore considers it very important to work closely together with other environmental groups and the different governments and companies of the Caribbean to form alliances to increase their leeway on the environmental agenda. The group is also very active in recycling in Barbados and works with several notable companies in Barbados to commit to recycling, especially plastics. The organization strongly encourage islanders to leave their plastic waste and to use more environmentally friendly shopping bags following the government research that in 1998 Barbadians were using over 78 000 000 plastic bags annually and was predicted to be over a billion by 2004. Some supermarket chains in Barbados are working with the group to use degradable plastic bags although others refuse to join the scheme. Programmes The CoRe Network (or Community Recycling Network) was established in 2010 with funding initially from the Coca Cola Foundation, and subsequently from the Peter Moore's Barbados Trust and the Embassy of the United States (Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean). The programme teaches local communities, especially school groups, to bring their clean recyclables together at a central point for collection and payment by local recycling brokers. The Green Business Barbados Programme is funded by a grant from the Inter American Development Bank. The project aims to give businesses the framework to \\"green\\" their organization and receive certification. The book Bri and Luk - Friends in Times of Changing Climates, written by former Future Centre Trust Administrative Director Nicole Garofano, aims to inform students ages 9 and 10 about the impact of climate change on small island developing states such as Barbados and surrounding Caribbean islands. A subsequent book - Book 2 - was developed for younger children, along with a puppet show that toured 30 schools in 2011. Here the story of Luk the polar bear unfolds. Luk comes to the Caribbean with his friend Bri the hummingbird to learn from the local animals and children how climate change is beginning to affect them. Copies of these books have been provided to every primary school in Barbados as a class set, with the hopes the students will engage in initial learning about climate change and its effects both locally and globally.

The \\"Campbell\\" breed was introduced to the public in 1898. In an attempt to create a more attractive buff-coloured duck Mrs. Campbell resorted to further cross-matings. The resulting progeny, introduced to the Public in January 1901, is alleged to have reminded Mrs. Campbell of British army uniforms, hence naming this new colour-form \\"Khaki Campbell Duck\\". The Khaki Campbell Duck Club was formed and in 1923, Mrs. Campbell's husband, Dr. Arthur Campbell was elected president.Poultry News, 21 December 1923 p.14 The following year, 1924, the Khaki Campbell Duck was accepted to the Standards of the Poultry Club, UK.The Feathered World Year book 1924 p.32 In 1941 Khaki Campbell Ducks were introduced to the American Standard of Perfection. This breed of duck is listed as 'Watch' by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy.  Characteristics  Campbells can come in three colour varieties: khaki, dark and white. They were developed by crossing between Mallard, Rouen and Runner ducks. The Khaki Campbell drake is mostly khaki- coloured with a darker head usually olive green lacking the white ring of its Mallard ancestors. The Khaki Campbell duck has a more modest plumage of Khaki covering the entirety of the body.  Use  The egg production of the Campbell breed can exceed even the most efficient of egg-laying domestic chickens, with the breed laying an average of 300 eggs a year. When provided a moderate \\"duck conscious\\" environment to live in they will lay a more than modest number of eggs per week. Campbells become mature at approximately 7 months. Campbell ducks seldom hatch out others' young; however, in very communal situations do hatch large broods together. Most brooding instinct has been selectively bred against in exchange for prolific egg laying ability in this breed. The ducks, when raised by hand, are not usually defensive of their eggs or nests, making collection of eggs very easy. Mechanical incubators or broody chickens are used to hatch out Campbell ducklings when ducks are not present in the process. Incubation takes approximately 23 to 28 days for a Campbell duckling to hatch and eggs need to be inspected for ducklings that have not emerged from their egg completely.

Origins The basic concept for the minicar was derived from a prototype built by Lawrence \\"Lawrie\\" Bond, an engineer from Preston. During the war, Bond had worked as an aeronautical designer for the Blackburn Aircraft Company before setting up a small engineering business in Blackpool, manufacturing aircraft and vehicle components for the government. After the war he moved his company to Longridge where he built a series of small, innovative racing cars, which raced with a modest amount of success. In the early part of 1948, he revealed the prototype of what was described as a new minicar to the press. Described as a \\"short radius runabout, for the purpose of shopping and calls within a 20-30-mile radius\\", the prototype was demonstrated climbing a 25 per cent gradient with driver and passenger on board. It was reported to have a Villiers two-stroke engine with a three-speed gearbox, a dry weight of and a cruising speed of around . At the time of the report (May 1948), it was stated that production was \\"expected to start in three months' time\\". The prototype was built at Bond's premises in Berry Lane, Longridge where it is now commemorated with a blue plaque. Sharp's Commercials was a company contracted by the Ministry of Supply to rebuild military vehicles. Knowing that the Ministry were ending their contract in 1948, and recognising the limitations of his existing works as a base for mass production, Bond approached the Managing Director of Sharp's, Lt. Col. Charles Reginald 'Reg' Gray, to ask if he could rent the factory to build his car. Gray refused, but said that instead, Sharp's could manufacture the car for Bond and the two entered into an agreement on this basis. Bond carried out some further development work on the Minicar, but once mass production was underway, left the project and sold the design and manufacturing rights to Sharp's. The engine bay of a 1959 Minicar Mark F. The kick start on the right hand side of the engine was fitted for emergency use; all Minicars were started from the driver's seat. The prototype and early cars utilised stressed skin aluminium bodywork, though later models incorporated chassis members of steel. The Minicar was amongst the first British cars to use fibreglass body panels. Though retaining much of Lawrie Bond's original concept of a simple, lightweight, economical vehicle, the Minicar was gradually developed by Sharp's through several different iterations. The majority of cars were convertibles, though later, hardtop models were offered, along with van and estate versions. Minicars were generally available either in standard or deluxe form, though the distinction between the two was largely one of mechanical detail rather than luxury. The cars were powered initially by a single-cylinder two-stroke Villiers engine of . In December 1949 this was upgraded to a unit. The engine was further upgraded in 1958, first to a single-cylinder and then to a twin-cylinder Villiers 4T. These air-cooled engines were developed principally as motorcycle units and therefore had no reverse gear. However, this was a minimal inconvenience, because the engine, gearbox and front wheel were mounted as a single unit and could be turned by the steering wheel up to 90 degrees either side of the straight-ahead position, enabling the car to turn within its own length. A method of reversing the car was offered on later models via a reversible Dynastart unit. The Dynastart unit, which doubled as both starter motor and dynamo on these models incorporated a built-in reversing solenoid switch. After stopping the engine and operating this switch the Dynastart, and consequently the engine, would rotate in the opposite direction. Tax position Tax advantages The car proved popular in the UK market, where its three-wheel configuration meant that it qualified for a lower rate of purchase tax, lower vehicle excise duty and cheaper insurance than comparable four-wheel cars. The three-wheel configuration, low weight and lack of a reverse gear also meant that it could be driven on a motor cycle licence. Tax changes In April 1962 the purchase tax rate of 55 percent, which had been applied to all four-wheeled cars sold in the UK since the war was reduced to 45 per cent. In November 1962, it was reduced by another 20 per cent to 25 per cent ‚Äì the same rate as that applied to three-wheelers. This rapid change meant that at the point of sale, some three-wheelers became more expensive than four-wheeled cars like the Mini. In response, Tom Gratrix, head of Sharp's sent a telegram to the Chancellor warning that unless a similar tax cut were given to the purchase tax rate for three-wheelers, there would be 300 redundancies and possibly the closure of the Sharp's factory. No cut was forthcoming, sales of Minicars declined rapidly from this point and the final Minicar was produced in 1966. At the end of production 24,482 had been made. Minicar 1949‚Äì51 Sold as the Bond Minicar (the Mark A suffix being added only after the Mark B was introduced), the car was advertised as the world's most economical car. It was austere and simple in design, without luxuries. Production began in January 1949, although 90 per cent of the initial production was said to have been allocated to the overseas market. As with the prototype, a large proportion of the Minicar was made from different aluminium alloys. The main body was a very simple construction of 18 swg sheet with a 14 swg main bulkhead. The integrity of the main stressed skin structure was enhanced by the absence of doors, the bodysides being deemed low enough to be stepped over without major inconvenience (unless you were wearing a skirt). Most of the bodywork panels were flat or fairly simple curves whilst the compound curves of the bonnet and rear mudguard arches were pressed out as separate panels. The windscreen was made from Perspex. The car was alleged to weigh only \\"all-in\\" or dry and its light weight was regularly demonstrated by one person lifting the entire rear end of the car off the ground unaided. A test run between Preston and London at an average speed of gave an average fuel consumption of for the journey. The car had a single bench seat with a small open compartment behind suitable for luggage. There was also a fold-down hood with detachable sidescreens. The headlights were separate units mounted on the side of the car, though of such low output, they have been described as providing \\"more of a glimmer than a beam\\". At the rear there was a tiny, single, centrally-mounted lamp. The air- cooled Villiers 10D engine had a unit construction three-speed manual gearbox without reverse. This had an output of at 4,400 rpm which the manufacturers claimed gave a power-to-weight ratio of per ton unladen. The engine unit sat in an alloy cradle ahead of the front wheel, together forming part of its support. Both front wheel and engine were sprung as part of the trailing link front suspension system, which was fitted with a single coil spring and an Andre Hartford friction damper. The rear wheels were rigidly mounted to the body on stub axles with suspension provided by low pressure \\"balloon\\" type tyres. Starting was achieved by using a pull handle mounted under the dash panel and connected by cable to a modified kick-start lever on the engine. The steering comprised a system of pulleys and a cable usually referred to as \\"bobbin and cable\\", connecting a conventional steering wheel to the front steering unit. The bobbin and cable steering arrangement was replaced by a rack and pinion system in October 1950. Brakes were provided on only the rear wheels; they were conventional drum brakes operated by a system of cables and rods. Early on, Sharp's adopted a policy of continual gradual upgrading of the Minicars, either to simplify or reduce maintenance, to redress noted failings or to improve some aspect of performance. Such changes were usually made available as kits to enable existing owners to upgrade their own cars retrospectively. In December 1949, a Deluxe version was added to the range. This has a Villiers 6E engine, which had an increased output to and a power- to-weight ratio of per ton. There were also a number of modest refinements including a spare wheel and a single wing mirror. The manually operated windscreen wiper fitted on the standard car was upgraded to an electric Lucas type. Although this was found to damage the original perspex windscreen, it was not replaced by a Triplex Safety Glass screen until the introduction of the Mark B in 1951.Sharp's Commercials Service Bulletin Sheet no. 9 A Bond Minicar Deluxe tested by The Motor magazine in 1949 and carrying only the driver had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 13.6 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£262 including taxes. Towards the end of 1949 (as unveiled and demonstrated in October at the Motor Cycle Show at Earls Court, London) an optional mechanical reversing device became available which comprised a long lever with a ratchet and a hexagonal socket on the end which fitted onto the centre of the driver's side rear wheel hub. This device could then be operated from the driving seat and allowed the car to be cranked backwards by hand to assist with maneuvering. Minicar Mark B 1951‚Äì52 Progressive development of the Minicar and Minicar Deluxe continued until the more significant introduction of coil sprung independent rear suspension and the much-needed Triplex Safety glass windscreen. (The Triplex windscreen was subsequently offered by Sharp's Commercials as a retro-fit kit for the earlier Minicar.) This provided an ideal opportunity to relaunch the car as the Bond Minicar (Mark B) in July 1951. Much of the design work for the Mark B, in particular the rear suspension, was carried out by the engineer Granville Bradshaw. Bradshaw had become involved with the Minicar at the invitation of his brother Ewart Bradshaw, the chairman of Loxhams and Bradshaws Group of which Sharp's Commercials was a subsidiary. The rear suspension system was of the sliding pillar type, a block carrying the stub axle rode up and down on two guide pillars mounted on a solid casting bolted to the side of the body. The block's vertical movement was controlled by coil springs. The front suspension was upgraded with a hydraulic shock absorber Externally, the differences between the Mark A and Mark B Minicar were very subtle. The rear mudguards were slightly smaller but wider to accommodate the wheel movement whilst the storage area behind the rear seats was also enlarged, increasing the cars overall length slightly and changing its rear profile. Beneath the bodywork, there were improvements to the electrics and to the braking system. The hood was also redesigned to provide more head room inside the car. Only one version of the Mark B Tourer was produced, and all production cars had the Villiers 6E engine and Triplex safety glass windscreens. Sharp's Commercials 1951‚Äì52 At the motorcycle show in November 1951, Sharp's announced what they described as \\"a revolutionary design in the field of commercial vehicles\\". The Sharp's Commercial 3 Cwt took the concept of the Minicar's light, three-wheeled, utilitarian design, and adapted it as the basis for an open-top lightweight industrial vehicle. The yellow and black prototype at the show was powered by an Indian BraveIndian Brave four-stroke side valve engine (supplied by Brockhouse Engineering Co., Southport) and mounted in a cradle ahead and above the front wheel. Though described as \\"constructed on the stressed-skin principle\\", large cut outs to allow easy access from either side of the vehicle required much additional strengthening to the floor, with a central steel backbone girder, a cross member between the rear wheels and further triangular bracing. The single seat was located centrally as was the steering wheel. Steering was by worm and sector, and flared side panels allowed the single front wheel to turn a full 180¬∞, making the vehicle extremely manoeuvrable. The entire engine, drive- train and steering unit could be removed by undoing four bolts to allow for easy servicing. Unlike the Minicar, there were brakes on all three wheels and there was a wooden-slatted floor behind the driver. Though the Sharp's Commercial never entered production, it served as a forerunner to van and pickup versions of the Mark B which appeared in 1952. The Sharp's Minitruck, (initially, they were referred to as Utility in the production records) was the pickup version, which outwardly was very similar to the Mark B Tourer, but included an extension of the bodywork behind the rear wheel. It also replaced the Tourer's bench seat with a single seat for the driver although unlike the centrally mounted one in the Commercial 3 Cwt, this was conventionally placed on the right. The extended goods compartment and space alongside the driver provided a claimed load capacity of 3 cwt and . The open-top vehicle had a folding hood with a roll-up flap at the back of the car to assist loading. The Sharp's Minivan, was introduced alongside the Minitruck. It had the same load capacity and also shared the same extended length of the pick-up, but had an enclosed aluminium compartment behind the driver's seat with a side hinged rear door. A short fabric roof covered the gap between the van compartment and the windscreen. A further final development based on the Minivan was the Bond Family \\"Safety Saloon\\". Additional side windows were fitted to the rear compartment of the van and two small hammock type seats were added either side of the rear door facing inwards. With the bench seat of the tourer replacing the single front seat of the van and pickup, this gave enough room for two children and two adults. The number of \\"Safety Saloons\\" produced is unknown, as factory records do not distinguish between the Saloon and the Minivan. Total production for the Mark B was 1414 vehicles including 240 Minitrucks / Utilities and 84 Minivans (and \\"Safety Saloons\\"). Minicar Mark C 1952‚Äì56 Around the same time as the Mark B was launched, work had begun on what was referred to subsequently as a \\"streamlined version\\" of the Minicar. Badged as the 'ESC' (England's Smallest Car), this prototype utilised the main body and rear suspension of the Mark B, but added mock front wings, a passenger side door and a valance beneath its oval-shaped grille. By the time of the Earl's Court Cycle and Motor Cycle Show in November 1951, three pre-production Mark C's were on show. On these the front wings had become longer and less triangular in profile than the ESC, the grille was also lower and more rounded and the front valance was now a more defined bumper shape. The new Minicar design was very well received, and was due to go on sale in early 1952. By July however, \\"owing to supply difficulties\\" it was still unavailable, and the earliest production cars were not recorded as being built until October 1952. Four of the cars were on display at that year's show along with a Sharp's Minivan. The change in the body style from the Mark B was both functional and aesthetic. The Mark C utilised the same 180¬∞ steering lock and worm and sector steering system that was seen in the prototype Commercial and the front wings allowed for ample clearance at full lock. They also addressed a demand from customers for a \\"greater smoothness of line\\", and allowed a more robust location for the mounting of the front lights. Other improvements included rod and cable operated brakes on all three wheels, which \\"appreciably shortens stopping distances.\\" During development, the Mark C had utilised the same sliding pillar suspension on the rear as the Mark B, but by September 1952, this had been changed for Flexitor suspension units produced by George Spencer Moulton & Co. Ltd. The Flexitor units were a type of lever arm shock absorber which used bonded rubber in torsion as the shock absorber. On these units a stub axle is mounted upon a trailing-arm with the pivot point being a steel rod. This rod is bonded inside a rubber tube which runs through and is also bonded to an external steel housing. The housing is bolted to the underside of the car. The units provide about of vertical movement to each independent rear axle. The engine mounting was substantially different. Instead of being suspended from an alloy cradle as on the Mark A and B, the engine now sat in a steel cradle bolted to a steeply inclined steel tube that pivoted directly behind the engine through an alloy steering head bracket. This bracket, holding the engine and front wheel unit is bolted to a cast alloy bulkhead which forms a major structural component of the car. The engine mounting was said to have been a regular source of failures on both the Mark A and the Mark B, and this new design was again the work of Granville Bradshaw. The single side door, which had been introduced to around 6¬Ω per cent of Mark B production vehicles after November 1951, became a standard fixture on the Mark C. Because the car's monocoque construction depended principally upon its skin for rigidity, the size of door was severely limited and to overcome the resulting decrease in structural rigidity, vertical steel strengthening brackets were fitted either side and along the bottom edge of the door aperture. By January 1953, some cars were being fitted with fibreglass rear wings. Bonnets in fibreglass followed soon after, but these were not used on production vehicles until December 1954. The production cost of the fibreglass parts was about the same as those of aluminium, but the parts were said to be both lighter and stronger. 1956 Bond Minicar Mark C Deluxe Tourer showing the later Type II grilleInitially, the Mark C was available only as either the Standard Tourer or the Deluxe Tourer with a single bench seat, seating two or three people. The Deluxe version included an electric starter along with rear bumpers. The range was expanded in March 1954, when the Standard Family Safety and Deluxe Family Safety versions were added. On these models the bodywork was extended behind the front seat and, like the earlier Bond Family Safety Saloon, two child-size inward facing hammock-style seats were added in the gap. Factory advertising material resurrected the Safety label as part of this model's name, but it was generally dropped elsewhere. The Sharp‚Äôs Minitruck continued in production but now incorporated all the new Mark C styling and mechanical features. The last one was made in March 1956. Attempts were made to penetrate the American market in 1953‚Äì54 where the car was marketed by Craven and Hedrick of New York and renamed the Sharp's Bear Cub. However it appears it made little impact and the arrangement was short-lived. As with previous Minicars, the Mark C was improved and developed over time with numerous minor changes. Most notably, Villiers replaced the 6E engine with the 8E version in June 1953. This had the same overall capacity, but slightly increased performance, now . In October 1953 a new Triplex windscreen and surround was introduced, the dashboard glove box was removed, a two-roll seat replaced the earlier round top variety and the old gearchange and steering shaft u/j's were eliminated. Steel was sometimes used for rear wings when supplies of aluminium became difficult to obtain. The following October's updates redesigned the braking system, introduced rear bumpers on the Tourer models and front bumpers for all Deluxes. Several more minor changes in October 1955 were marked by a much more notable change to the shape of the front grille from the familiar oval to a more angular design (designated Type II). Minicar Mark D 1956‚Äì58 In May 1956, the Mark C was discontinued and the Mark D introduced. The changes between the last Mark Cs and the Mark D are, like those between the final Mark As and the Mark B, almost entirely hidden from view and the cars are externally identical. Beneath the Mark D bonnet however, Villiers had substantially upgraded the engine, which now became the Mark 9E. The main changes were a 4-plate clutch, a heavier final drive chain with simplified adjustment and a higher top-gear ratio. The 9E was said to produce a 12¬Ω per cent increase in power over the 8E, providing a claimed at 4,000 rpm. This increased the cruising speed to around , with a top speed of . Electrics were upgraded from 6 to 12 volt, allowing more powerful headlights with separate side-lights within the headlamp units. All Deluxe models include the SIBA Dynastart. Other changes which had been gradually introduced onto Mark Cs over the years, were carried over to the Mark D. This included items such as strengthened rear suspension, chrome side flashes on the front wings of Deluxe models and larger rear lights with integrated rear reflectors. As well as the slight weight increase, Sharp's also noted that ground clearance on the Mark D was now only compared to the Mark C's . Four versions of the car were offered by the factory: the two/three seater Standard Tourer and Deluxe Tourer and the four seat (two adult front seats and two child-size inward facing hammock-style seats) Standard Family Safety and Deluxe Family Safety. The two/three seater models were also available directly from Sharps with a detachable fibreglass hardtop. Similar aftermarket hardtops had been introduced earlier in the year for every type of Minicar from the Mark A to the Mark C Family by the Sharples Engineering Company, who were also based in Preston. The revised engine was reported to give the Mark D notably better acceleration, better climbing ability and lower fuel consumption in direct comparison with its predecessor. Reverse via the Dynastart unit became an option from October 1956 on the Deluxe models. With the introduction of the Mark E in December 1957, the two/three seater Mark Ds were dropped from the range as were the hardtops and the Standard version of the Family Safety. The Deluxe Family Safety continued in production alongside the Mark E and by August 1958 still accounted for about 25 per cent of production. A four-speed gearbox replaced the three-speed version in October 1958 and the model was renamed the Family Tourer. A final version of the Mark D, the Family Four Saloon was shown at the 1958 Motorcycle show. This car had a lengthened rear wings and tail section and a built-in hardtop with side windows and wrap around rear screen. This version never entered production, and only one is believed to have been produced. Production of all versions of the Mark D ended in November 1958, although the Family Tourer remained listed as \\"available\\" until the 1960 range was announced. Minicar Mark E 1956‚Äì58 Announced on 31 October 1956 as a late addition to the 1957 range, the Mark E was radically different in design from any previous Minicar. A deliberate attempt to introduce \\"modern car lines\\", the Mark E introduced semi-monocoque construction, both to improve the resilience of the car and to allow full- height doors to be fitted on both sides. As announced, the prototype car was completely flat-sided and as with previous models used light alloy for all exterior panels. Beneath the skin, there were two main steel frames, one which made up the principle support for the floor, rear suspension and doors and a second which carried the steering assembly and engine. This second frame was described as \\"semi-floating\\" to allow the damping out of engine vibrations and to prevent fractures. Further strength was obtained by separating the bonnet from the front grill, allowing the grill frame to add rigidity to the front of the car. Track and overall width of the car were the same as the Mark D, but the wheelbase was extended by . Though not appreciated at the time, this fundamentally affected the car's stability and made it liable to overturn. Weather protection was more sophisticated, the hood now including a front section that could be rolled back as a sunroof while the detachable side screens incorporate sliding windows. The seat was still a single bench, but the backrest was now split, one third allowing for adjustment to suit driver comfort, whilst the remainder hinged forward to allow access to the boot. Lighting was improved with larger headlamps, flashing indicators and rear number plate light. The fuel tank was increased in size to , but the car retained the Villiers 9E/3 engine with three-speed gearbox. Deliveries of the new car were expected to begin in May 1957. As things turned out, demand for the Mark D Minicar was such that a decision was made to delay the introduction of the Mark E until later. Despite one of the prototypes being used for an extensive European tour in the summer of 1957 by one magazine, it was not until other pre-production cars were tested by the factory immediately prior to full production that issues with the car's handling were revealed. The Mark E Tourer was eventually put on the market in December 1957 alongside the Mark D. In production, the Mark E was notably different from its prototype with a shorter wheelbase and wider track to correct the stability issues. Rather than widen the entire car to retain the flat sides of the prototype, the extra track width was accommodated by making the bottom part of the rear wings flair outwards. The rear wheels were also moved forward by approximately . Inside the car, there were changes to the shape of the fibreglass dashboard and the engine was upgraded to the Villiers 9E/4S with four-speed gearbox. Externally, the overriders seen on the pre-production vehicles were removed from both front and rear bumpers and the car now included two windscreen wipers. The maximum speed was now around . In May 1958, a second version of the Mark E became available, the Mark E Saloon Coupe. Externally, because the roof was longer than that on the tourer, this gave the impression that the car was a 2+2, but internally it was the same size, and simply replaced the convertibles soft top with a full-length fibreglass roof. Though not described as a detachable hardtop, the roof could (with a little patience!) be removed in one piece, if desired. In a publicity stunt for Sharp's, three Bond Minicar Mark Es, (two Saloon Coupes and a Tourer) were the first cars to drive along Britain's first motorway, the Preston By-pass when it opened on the morning of 5 December 1958. The Sales Department thought it would be a good idea for Bonds to be the first in the line-up when the T.V. cameras recorded the opening. (The Bonds were actually not the first to arrive as an Austin Healey Sprite had already beaten them to it. However, after a bit of negotiating and no doubt some financial recompense, the Sprite owner obligingly moved over and the Bonds lined up as planned!) The idea was for the first and third cars fitted with only 197 cc engines (driven by Doug Ferriera in LRN 963 and Alan Pounder in car 3) to hold up the traffic by blocking both lanes (the Preston By-pass was only a dual carriageway when it was first opened) whilst the second car, LCK 479 a Tourer driven by John Woods the Production Manager (and fitted with one of the new Villiers 247 cc engines  as available in the new Mark F), would pull out, overtake the first car and speed off into the lead, ready to be photographed by the BBC But the plan back-fired, because the Bond beat the camera crew to the bridge where the shot was to take place! Consequently, the evening news only showed the second and third Bonds amongst the traffic on the opening day. Now part of the M6, this event was recreated for the motorways 50th anniversary by the BBC's Inside Out programme in 2008. Mark E production ended in November 1958. Minicar Mark F 1958‚Äì63 The November 1958 London Motorcycle show was used to launch the Minicar Mark F. As with the change from the Mark C to D, the designation was primarily to denote significant mechanical progression from the Mark E rather than any notable difference in the cars external appearance. Three versions of the new model were shown, the Mark F Tourer, the Mark F Saloon Coupe and the Mark F 4-Seater Family Saloon. The Tourer and Coupe were identical to the Mark E versions but the Villiers 9E engine was replaced by a Villiers 31A. Though this engine boasted at 4,500 rpm (an increase of ), the fuel consumption, dimensions and weight of the unit were almost identical to the 9E. Tests during the summer of 1958 included climbing a 28 per cent gradient \\"without a struggle\\" and stop and restart tests two-up on the same slope. Top speed was given as with an average fuel consumption of . The 4-Seater Family Saloon was identical to the Coupe from the outside, but inside, the rear deck was cut back to allow space for a forwards facing hammock style rear seat, just big enough for two children. Unlike the similar seats in the Mark D Family, this could be completely detached for load carrying. All three models offered optional reverse gear. A fourth model, the Bond Ranger light van was introduced in March 1960. This utilised the body with the cut out behind the front seats from the Family Saloon and married it with a similar hardtop roof without side windows, but with the addition of an opening flap around the rear window. Very much an economy model, in standard form it came finished in primer with topcoat as an optional extra. A total of 39 cars of this type were recorded in factory production records as a Van rather than a Ranger. This is believed to denote that they were only fitted with a single driver's front seat to increase load capacity, much like the 1952 Minitruck. U.K. law at the time also meant that this type of lightweight, single-seat three-wheeler could be driven unaccompanied on learner L-plates without the need to pass a driving test. Production of the Saloon Coupe and the Tourer was discontinued in July 1961, followed by the Family Saloon a month later in August 1961 to make way for the introduction of the new Mark G model. The Ranger continued to be produced alongside the Mark G until it too was discontinued in October 1962. Minicar Mark G 1961‚Äì66 Billed extensively as the \\"new-line\\" Minicar, the final evolution of the Bond Minicar was still based to a large extent on the bodyshell of the Mark F. Nevertheless, a revised shape fibreglass roof, new doors, new windscreen with opening quarter lights and bigger wheels largely transformed the cars appearance. However, although the car was similar in layout to the Mark F, almost everything mechanically about the Mark G was different with very few components carried over. Steel supports around the quarter lights allowed the windscreen to be both more steeply raked and moved forwards to provide more interior room. This also allowed a properly sprung bench-type rear seat to be fitted capable of seating two adults. The front seats were adjustable for position and the passenger side now folded much further forward than on previous models to allow easier access to the rear, although the doors were still felt to be too narrow for easy entry. Controls were similar to the Mark F, but the fuel tap was now moved from beneath the bonnet to under the dash. Doors were now lockable and included wind-up windows. Production of the Mark G began in August 1961 and initially the Bond 250 G Minicar was the only version available. The new style roof offered several inches more headroom and incorporated a backward-slanted rear window of the type popularised in the UK by the Ford Anglia. This was initially mirrored by nominal fibreglass tailfins inserted into the aluminium rear wings before the wings became entirely made from fibreglass. Under the bonnet, the car utilised the new Villiers Mk 35A unit designed specifically for it. A development of the 31A, the new engine incorporated numerous mechanical refinements to improve strength and reliability, albeit slightly at the cost of overall power, now rated at at 4,500 rpm. Rear suspension was completely revised, with trailing arm units controlled by Armstrong dampers. The rod and cable brake systems of previous cars was also replaced by a Lockheed semi hydraulic and rod braking system (front brake fully hydraulic, but rear brakes still rod operated from a central floor-mounted hydraulic cylinder) acting on all three wheels. Two further models were added to the range in May 1962 and June 1962 respectively, the Mark G Ranger and the Mark G Estate. The estate featured a large hatchback, hinged at the roof. Inside, the rear seats could also be folded flat or removed entirely. On the Ranger version the rear seats and rear side windows were omitted. Although public response at the 1962 Motorcycle show remained encouraging, the changes to purchase tax meant there was now a much less significant price difference between the Minicar and other small cars and in November production was scaled back with consequential job losses. Nevertheless, development continued, and a choice of engines was offered on all models from March 1963. Villiers modified and developed their 2T twin-cylinder engine unit specifically for Bond and this new engine was designated the 4T. It produced () at 5,500 rpm and top speed was now said to be \\"just over\\" with an average fuel consumption of . Saloon models were fitted with an opening boot from April 1964. In a bid to stem declining sales, a 2-seat economy version of the Minicar was introduced in October 1964, the Bond Mark G Tourer. This basically used the saloon car body, but with a larger rear deck incorporating an opening boot lid, a folding hood, new fibreglass bonnet, plain door panels, no chrome side trim and non-opening quarter lights. In standard form it came with the 35A engine, but the side trim and 4T engine were available as an option. Saloon and Tourer production ceased in October and December 1965 respectively, whilst production of the Ranger and the Estate ended in April 1966. The last ever Minicar produced was an Estate painted only in primer in November 1966. The production records do not show any engine number for this vehicle but it is recorded as being destined for Greece.

The Institute was founded in Reims, France in 1680, with over 75,000 Brothers and lay colleagues who conduct schools as well as educational works in about 82 countries worldwide. Background In the aftermath of the Philippine Revolution against Spain and the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War which immediately followed, the Protestant denomination, first introduced by the new American colonial masters and aided by the newly arrived American teachers, the Thomasites, was gaining a foothold among Filipinos because of the then strong anti-Spanish Friar sentiment existing at that time.De La Salle University- Manila (2003). Student handbook: 2003-06. Manila: De La Salle University- Manila. Due to the then very small number of Catholic educational institutions in the country, the then American Archbishop of Manila Jeremiah James Harty, himself an alumnus of a De La Salle Christian Brothers school in St. Louis, Missouri, would appeal to the Superior-General of the Christian Brothers in 1905 for the establishment of a De La Salle school in the Philippines. While there was a growing pressure for a De La Salle school, Archbishop Harty's request was rejected, because of the Christian Brothers' lack of funds. Nonetheless, Harty continued to appeal to Pope Pius X for the establishment of additional Catholic schools in the country. History  Arrival in the Philippines The nine pioneer Brothers at Paco On March 10, 1911, upon instructions from the Vatican to the La Salle Generalate, Brothers Blimond Pierre (who would serve as the school's first director), Aloysius Gonzaga, and Augusto Correge, arrived in the Philippines from Europe. Six other De La Salle brothers arrived between March and June: Brothers Louis, Camillus, B. Joseph, Celba John, Imar William, and Martin. They came from the United States, Ireland, Luxembourg, and France. Together, on June 16, 1911, the Brothers opened the first La Salle school in the country. The location is at the former Perez-Samanillo Compound on 652 Calle Nozaleda in Paco, Manila. The school was first attended by 100 students. Reactions from the locals The initial perception of Filipinos about the then newly arrived De La Salle Christian Brothers were that they were no different from the Spanish Friars who were previously the sole handlers of Philippine education for almost three hundred years. Over time, the Brothers established their congregation as being a group of full-time religious educators who have consecrated their lives for the education of the youth. In 1921, the Brothers transferred the school from its original site in Paco, Manila to the then-wooded newly constructed Taft Avenue in Malate, Manila because of the increasing school population. During this time, the Brothers' devotion to education would be cemented by the numerous visits of head of states to De La Salle and by the proclamation of De La Salle as the Philippine Islands' Premier School for Boys by Dr. Paul Monroe and a commission of American educators, after an eight-month cross-country inspection of existing Philippine schools in the 1930s. The February 12, 1945 massacre After the war, the school chapel, formerly dedicated to St. Joseph, was blessed and re-dedicated to the Most Blessed Sacrament On February 12, 1945, a Japanese Army officer along with 20 soldiers forcibly made their way into the college, which was then a refuge for 70 people, including 30 women and young girls, 16 European De La Salle Christian Brothers (all the pre-war American De La Salle Christian Brothers had been interned in the Los Ba√±os Concentration Camp) and the college's chaplain-Redemptorist Father Cosgrave CSSR (an Australian), and the adult men of two families. Two days earlier, De La Salle College Director-Brother Egbert Xavier FSC (an Irishman) was abducted by another group of Japanese soldiers, and was never seen again. After the Japanese troops herded all the people into the school chapel, they were then subsequently shot, slashed or bayoneted. Those who did not die in the attack were left to bleed to death. The Japanese attempted to rape some of the dying women. The chapel was then set on fire but it was not destroyed because it was built of marble and concrete.

On February 2, 1970, the Philippine Province became an independent District of the Institute, to be known as the De La Salle Brothers in the Philippines. At present, the sub-district of Myanmar is under the Philippine District. The Brother Visitor The Brother Visitor is the official title of the head of a particular District of the Christian Brothers although for purposes of communication with non-members of the La Sallian family, the title, Brother Provincial is used because of its commonality with the title used to describe the district heads of other religious congregations. The Brother Visitor is the person responsible for assigning Brothers to their communities and providing for the different posts of responsibility as deemed necessary by the District Chapter. He is also responsible for admitting candidates to the Novitiate as well as the making of vows. Also, as specified in canon law, he is authorized to issue writings on matters of religion or morality. The Philippine District has had eight Brother Visitors, who are elected for three-year terms. The first was Brother Justin Lucian FSC, who was elected in 1970 and was also the last Auxiliary Visitor from the Baltimore District. The incumbent is Brother Edmundo Fernandez FSC.

It is an authentic garden created by multiple award-winning Iris Bannochie Iris Bannochie, a female, Barbadian, self-taught scientist. It is unique, having been created from the 1950s as both a private botanical garden and a pleasure garden by an individual. Named from the Greek mythological figure of Andromeda it started as a private plant collection around Ms Bannochie's home, who was also the leading expert on horticulture on the island.Andromeda Homepage Ms Bannochie wrote various academic papers from topics including the lifecycle of the whistling frog, and the vitamin C content of the Barbadian cherry. She was a mentor to many and considered the queen of Barbadian horticulture. At one point, she was responsible for introducing over 80% of the ornamental plants found in Barbados. Andromeda Botanic Gardens is a Partner Garden of the UK Royal Horticultural Society, the only garden with such a status in the West Indies. In October 2019, the garden received the Botanical Treasure Award from the Biological Education and Research Programme, in recognition of it biological diversity. It has appeared on UK television and was the subject of the first online lecture in September 2020, facilitated by Kew Mutual Improvement Society at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Andromeda Botanic Gardens was first open to the public during a fund raising event hosted by the Barbados Horticultural Society in the 1970s. Andromeda was well received, and has remained open to the public by paid admission since then. Andromeda has over five hundred different species of plants adapted to a range of tropical environments. In 2018, the Palm Garden contained over 50 different species of palm and there were approximately 100 different tree species. Over 90 plant families are represented at Andromeda Botanic Gardens, making this garden one of the most plant diverse gardens in the tropical world. Iris Bannochie founded the garden in 1954 on land owned by her family since 1740, and showed plants from Andromeda both independently and with the Barbados Horticultural Society many times at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show in London. In 1982, Ms Bannochie's display was titled Andromeda Gardens at the Show and her exhibition of palms was the largest selection of that plant family ever seen at the Chelsea Flower Show. In 1990, the garden had 40,000 visitors. Andromeda Botanic Gardens is the only Royal Horticultural Society Partner Garden in the West Indies, receiving that status in 2016. Andromeda Botanic Gardens is owned by the Barbados National Trust, having been bequeathed to the Trust when Ms Bannochie died in 1988. It is currently leased to Passiflora Ltd. This company is responsible for the garden's management and development and it is a registered training provider and assessment centre, offering a range of horticultural courses. Interns, particularly from France, spend two months working alongside the gardening team. The Andromeda Botanic Gardens Educational Program is run in co-ordination with the Department of Biological & Chemical Sciences of the University of the West Indies. The University of the West Indies (UWI), has responsibility for Research activities at Andromeda. At the centre of the upper garden is a majestic native banyan. When Queen Ingrid of Denmark visited the garden in 1971, she was served refreshments in a recently built gazebo overlooking the sea.

His career of over twenty-five years has been characterised by numerous successes on the Irish charts as well as recurring problems with drug addiction and recovery. Early life Born at Holles Street Hospital in Dublin on 23 May 1960, Dignam grew up in the north Dublin suburb of Finglas. He studied the classical art of bel canto singing with teacher Frank Merriman at the Bel Canto House School of Singing in Dublin. At the age of six, he was raped by a neighbour. This continued to occur over a three-year period until, at the age of nine, Dignam sought help from his best friend's brother, a man in his twenties. During the meeting with his best friend's brother, Dignam explained his situation and he was then raped by this man as well. Dignam later suggested his drug addiction may have resulted from the psychological trauma caused by these events. Music career Dignam formed a precursor of Aslan called Meelah XVIII. A review in Hot Press of a gig to shut a toxic dump in Finglas said \\"What a great singer!\\" Meelah XVIII created a recording for The Dave Fanning Show on 2FM in 1980. The Meelah XVIII songs \\"Toy Soldier\\" and \\"Meelah Pt. 2\\" were included on the Aslan triple CD, The \\"Rarities\\" disc from \\"The Platinum Collection\\". Meelah XVIII musicians were Christy Dignam, Tony Talbot, Mick McKenna, Joe Jewell, and Gerry Conlon. As Aslan singles \\"This Is\\", \\"Please Don't Stop\\", \\"Loving Me Lately\\", \\"Pretty Thing\\" and \\"Feel No Shame\\" became popular, Dignam's relationship with his bandmates was becoming strained due to his problems with heroin addiction. On Wednesday 7 September 1988, The Star newspaper ran with the headline \\"ASLAN: IT'S THE END\\", informing the public of Dignam's separation from Aslan. The remaining members of the band continued as Aslan for some time (with a new lead singer, Eamon Doyle) before the band eventually split. Dignam went solo with guitarist Conor Goff, forming Dignam & Goff. However, on 11 July 1993 Aslan reformed, for what was supposed to be a \\"once off gig\\" in Finglas. With a reignited spark and new material, Aslan continued to become one of Ireland's most successful and hard- working bands. Their studio albums include \\"Feel No Shame\\", \\"Goodbye Charlie Moonhead\\", \\"Here Comes Lucy Jones\\" and \\"Waiting for the Madness To End\\". They have had two \\"best of\\" albums: Shame About Lucy Moonhead and the triple album The Platinum Collection. They have also had a best-selling live album Made in Dublin and an official bootleg album (available at gigs) called Aslan Live at the Olympia which features appearances from Jerry Fish, Relish and Damien Rice. Influences Dignam lists Tom Waits, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie, T-Rex, Bon Jovi, Phil Lynott, The Rolling Stones, and John Lennon as his musical influences. He has also been listed as an influence on artists and groups including Damien Dempsey, Jerry Fish, Damien Rice, George Murphy, Rob Smith, Alabama 3, and more. Personal life Dignam has been married for more than 37 years to his wife Kathryn, and has a daughter, Kiera, who is also a singer. He has two grandsons, Cian & Jake and a granddaughter, Ava. He deals with the intersections of his personal and professional lives in the autobiography (with Damian Corless) 'My Crazy World' published worldwide by Simon And Schuster in September 2019. Health Dignam turned to heroin in the 1980s, and his involvement with the drug caused conflicts which led to his eventual departure from Aslan. He entered multiple drug treatment programs, including a stint in a rehab program in a Buddhist monastery, Wat Tham Krabok, in Thailand in 2004. This was featured in the documentary Heroin: Facing The Dragon.Dignam, Christy. \\"Interview with Pat Kenny\\". The Late, Late Show. RTƒî Television, Ireland. 12 November 2004. Dignam recounted his story of drug addiction in his autobiography, This is Christy Dignam, co-written by journalist Neil Fetherstonhaugh and published by Merlin Publishing. One reviewer said it \\"should be required reading for anyone hovering on the edges of the drug culture.\\" In September 2010, Dignam was admitted to hospital for tests. Cancer diagnosis Dignam was initially admitted to hospital with a suspected chest infection; this progressed to pneumonia. After numerous tests were carried out in March 2013, he was diagnosed with amyloidosis. Upon returning to consciousness Dignam spoke of having had a near-death experience that prompted doctors to inject him with two shots of adrenaline. Dignam said, \\"There was a blockage in my arm where the adrenaline was going in so they had to slit the side of my neck, straight into the jugular and right down into my heart. I felt like I had died for a minute or so, nothing seemed to matter, then suddenly the adrenaline restarted my heart.\\" He underwent chemotherapy for the condition, and as of September 2017, continues to receive chemotherapy.

The Thiruporur Kandaswamy temple is situated in the center of the town. There is a large temple tank in the vicinity of the temple.

In Thiruporur, 13% of the population is under 6 years of age. History SHRI KANDASWAMY TEMPLE, THIRUPORUR: Thiruporur Kandaswamy temple ALSO KNOWN AS SUBRAMANYA SWAMY TEMPLE is an ancient temple dating back to the Pallava period and is one of 33 major temples in Tamil Nadu dedicated to the worship of Murugan. The very name Thruporur in Tamil language means \\"the place of the holy war\\" The Sthalapurana also discloses that at this place Murugan with his consorts Valli and Devayanai granted protection to devas and expounded the meaning of Pranava to Agastya Muni. According to legend, Skanda enunciated the principle of pranava or reality to the devas here. The very concept of Pranavam is said to have worshipped Skanda here, and the hill behind the temple is known as Pranava Malai. Legend also have it that Vishnu worshipped Shiva on the Pranava Hill. Legend also has it that Skanda worshipped Shiva as Vanmeekeswarar to rid himself of the sin of having killed Soorapadman. HISTORY; Tirupporur Devasthanam preserves Pallava inscriptions from as early as the 10th century as well as from the period of Vikrama Chola of the 12th century CE. As evidenced from an inscription found on a stone pillar in this temple, one is inclined to infer that the temple must have been originally built in the reign of Pallavas because of the two birudus of atyantakama and adiranachandra ascribable Rajasimha (Narasimha Varma II). Tirupporur flourished in that age but disappeared into oblivion for some time. During the middle of the seventeenth century, Tirupporur was rediscovered and renovated by Chidambara Swamigal who is said to be a descendant of one of the poets of the Tamil Sangam of Madurai. Legends have it that Chidambara Swamy who was an ardent worshipper of \\"Madurai Meenakshi Amman\\" had a vision of the Goddess bidding him to build a temple for Lord Muruga at Thiruporur. This happened when the savant challenged the Goddess that he would not eat until she graced him with her vision. Many days passed and Chidambaraswamy was almost in a coma. Suddenly he could hear the anklets of the Goddess Meenakshi and when he opened his eyes slightly, he got a magnificent glimpse of the divine feet. The Goddess then raised the swamy to his feet and as her hands touched him, his skin turned golden. She told him that six earlier attempts to establish the temple had failed. Chidambaraswamy reached Thiruporur to find that it was a dense forest full of palm trees. He could hardly make out where the attempts to build the temple had been made. When he was making desperate unsuccessful attempts for locating the site, Lord Muruga himself appeared as a small boy and gave him the vision of the place where Lord Murugan as Swayambhu Murti lay covered up by an anthill. Chidambara Swamigal having discovered the Swayambu Moortis of Lord Muruga with his consorts unearthed them and established the temple. The descendants of Chidambara Swamigal followed up the religious service and brought it to the present day fame. The sanctum sanctorum of this temple is situated on the eastern side wherein one can see the palmyra tree and the anthill under it wherein is Kanda Perumal with Valli and Devayanai on a small peetham. Chidambara Swamigal used to perform abhishekam to these images. The murti in the anthill is covered with kavacham and other jewels but no abhishekam is performed for this deity. This temple enshrines Skanda in several forms relating to legends from the Skanda Puranam. The foremost of these is the depiction of Skanda as a warrior, SamhƒÅra Subramanyar. He is also enshrined in the form of a child, expounding the meaning of the oneness of creation Om to his father Shiva. Skanda is enshrined with his consorts Valli and Devasena in an east facing sanctum. No abhishekams are offered to these images. The 24 pillared hall and the 30 pillared circular hall are other features of this temple. There is a shrine to Vembadi Vinayakar under a neem tree. On the southern side of the temple there is Saravana Poigai and Valliyar Odai, the two sacred teerthams. On the eastern side of the teerthams, there is a mandapam of four pillars. There is also another teertham by name PranavƒÅmritam. Brahmotsava during the Tamil month Maci and Skanda Sashti are some of the important festival conducted in this temple. Skanda Sashti is celebrated in the Tamil month of Aippasi. Other festivals celebrated here include Margazhi Tiruvadirai and Navaratri. Arunagirinatha has sung four Tiruppugazh psalms in praise of Lord Muruga at Tirupporur. Tirupporur Sannidhimurai, Tirupporur Purana, Kalambagam, Alamkara-Panchakam, and Pranavachala Satalam are some of the works relating to this temple by Purasai Ashtavadanam Sabhapati Mudaliar. Other noteworthy literary works relating to this temple are Tirupporur Kovali Tirupporur Anadadi and the songs of Ramalinga Vallalar and Pamban Swamigal. Tirupporur is considered as the head of the places wherein Lord Muruga willingly lives. Arunagirinatha goes to the extent of saying that all the four Vedas worship at Tirupporur. In the sanctum sanctorum one can have the darshan of swayambhu m≈´rti of Muruga in the form of a palmyra tree. Beneath the swayambhu m≈´rti in a small platform is the idol of Muruga in Brahmasasta from with the two consorts on both sides. It is said that the small idols were made by Chidambaram Swamigal for performing abhisheka and arƒÅdana. When one circumambulates the inner prakara can have a glimpse of the exquisitely chiseled panchaloha idols of Vighneswara, SomƒÅskanda, Chandrasekara, Dwanishandeswara, Astra Deva, Brahma, Vishu, Devendra Nandi and Matruchandesa. The copper icon of Lord Muruga sitting on the lap of Lord Siva in the posture of Shiva hearing pranava upadesha chiseled according to the details and descriptions found in Manasaram, a treatise on silpa sastra. The base relief of upadesa to Agastya, Vallikalyana and Agni- ganta Subrahmanya have been chiseled very beautifully on the pillars of Sarvavaidya Mandapa. The yantra established by Chidambaram Swamigal can be found in the northeast of the temple on a platform with k≈´rma, ashtagaja, astnaga and ganas. Daily pujas are performed to this yantra. In the outer mandapa is situated the sannidhi of Teyvayanai. Tirupporur is situated 25 kilometres northeast of Chengalpet and is connected by bus service with Chennai at a distance of 45 kilometres. It is believed that functions like ear boring, head trouncing as offering to the Lord, conducting marriages etc., bring sacred blessings.

The railroad is owned by KBN Incorporated jointly between Independent Locomotive Service of Bethel MN and Midwest Locomotive Services of Atwater MN, with the railroad headquartered in Rush City, Minnesota. As of 2008, the St. Croix Valley Railroad handled approximately 3,700 carloads per year. The primary commodities hauled included, chemicals, grain, flour, sand and fertilizers. As of 2014, The St. Croix Valley handled Approximately 16,000 car loads. The St. Croix Valley Railroad interchanges with the BNSF Railway in Hinckley, Minnesota. History The St. Croix Valley Railroad was created in September 1997 when the railroad‚Äôs former owner, RailAmerica Incorporated, purchased two segments of track in eastern Minnesota from the BNSF Railway. Also included in the sale were 8 miles (13 kilometres) of trackage rights on the BNSF Hinckley Subdivision between Hinckley, Minnesota and Brook Park, Minnesota. The two segments of track initially acquired by the St. Croix Valley Railroad included the 36 mile (58 kilometre) Amber Subdivision between Hinckley, Minnesota and North Branch, Minnesota and an 11-mile (18 kilometre) spur of the Hinckley Subdivision between Brook Park, Minnesota and Mora, Minnesota. Before the BNSF Railway gained ownership of the portion of the Amber Subdivision subsequently sold to the St. Croix Valley Railroad, the line was owned by the Burlington Northern Railroad. Before that, it was owned by the Northern Pacific Railway and formed that railroad‚Äôs so-called \\"Skally Line\\" from St. Paul, Minnesota to Duluth, Minnesota. This line was originally built as the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad, later the St. Paul and Duluth Railroad. The Great Northern Railway, however, also had tracks that followed roughly the same route. When both the Great Northern Railway and the Northern Pacific Railway merged to form the Burlington Northern Railroad in 1970, the \\"Skally Line\\" became redundant and portions of it slowly became abandoned. Along with the segment operated by the St. Croix Valley Railroad, the only other portions that remain today are small pieces near St. Paul, Minnesota (currently operated by the Minnesota Commercial Railway) and Duluth, Minnesota (currently operated by the BNSF Railway). The abandoned portions of the route have been converted to rail trails: the Willard Munger State Trail (also known as Hinckley Fire Trail) between Hinckley and Duluth, and the Hardwood Creek Trail and Sunrise Prairie Trail between North Branch and Hugo. The 11 mile (18 kilometre) spur sold by the BNSF Railway to the St. Croix Valley Railroad was also formerly owned by the Burlington Northern Railroad. Before that, it was owned by the Great Northern Railway and formed a line that went from Brook Park, Minnesota to St. Cloud, Minnesota. In March 2003, unsafe track conditions that led to an embargo on all traffic caused the St. Croix Valley Railroad to abandon its line from Brook Park to Mora. The St. Croix Valley still retains its trackage rights to Brook Park MN. Ownership of the St. Croix Valley Railroad was turned over from Railamerica Incorporated to KBN Incorporated named for Tom Kotnour, Norman (Pete) Bierwerth of Midwest Locomotive Inc. and Frank Nesbit of Independent Locomotive Service, jointly owning KBN, in 2001. Both companies are based in Minnesota with KBN owning two other short line railroads: the Minnesota Northern Railroad in northwestern Minnesota and the Dakota Northern Railroad in eastern North Dakota. Deterioration of the Snake River bridge crossing in Pine City caused a disruption to the line in 2009 but it was reconstructed. Locomotive and Freight Car Fleet SCXY 1363 St. Croix Valley Railroad owns locomotive EMD GP9 lettered SCXY 1363. The SCXY 1363 is now black with a yellow cab face and side trim (separated by a red stripe), recalling the Northern Pacific Railway paint scheme commonly found on later NPRY diesels (shortly before the 1970 BN merger). The words \\"St. Croix Valley\\" are visible on the long hood. The paint scheme was previously green with yellow striping. SCXY 1352, an EMD GP8, is also painted in the same fashion as SCXY 1363. In 2014 in the line added two SD40M-2's (SD45 bodies). SCXY 1326 and then SCXY 1325 were acquired to help with additional traffic.

It is believed that Lord Ganesha and Skanda had a quarrel for a mango fruit offered by Sage Narada. A contest was conducted that whoever goes around the world first and comes back here would be offered the fruit. While Lord Skanda went around the world Lord Ganesha encircled his parents and got the fruit as a token of appreciation.

It is a fast-paced, non-contact, highly strategic team game, which can be played by anyone regardless of age or gender. Gateball is played on a rectangular court long and wide. Each court has three gates and a goal pole. The game is played by two teams (red and white) of up to five players. Each player has a numbered ball corresponding to their playing order. The odd-numbered balls are red and the even-numbered balls are white. Teams score one point for each ball hit through a gate and two points for hitting the goal pole, in accordance with the rules. A game of gateball lasts for thirty minutes and the winner is the team with the most points at the end of the game. History Gateball was invented in Japan by Suzuki Kazunobu in 1947. At the time there was a severe shortage of rubber needed to make the balls used in many sports. Suzuki, then working in the lumber industry on the northern island of Hokkaido, realised there was a ready supply of the wood used to make croquet balls and mallets. He revised the rules of croquet and created gateball as a game for young people.Guttman, Allen and Lee Thompson (2001) Japanese Sport: A History. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press Gateball first became popular in the late 1950s when a physical education instructor introduced gateball to the women's societies and senior citizens‚Äô clubs of Kumamoto City. In 1962, the Kumamoto Gateball Association was formed and established a local set of rules. This version of the game became known nationally when it was demonstrated at a national fitness meet in Kumamoto in 1976. Shortly afterwards the gateball's popularity exploded as local government officials and representatives of senior citizens‚Äô organisations introduced the sport around the country. In 1984, the Japanese Gateball Union (JGU) was founded. Under the leadership of its inaugural chairman, Ryoichi Sasakawa, the JGU developed a unified set of rules and organised the first national meet. The following year, the JGU joined with five countries and regions, China, Korea, Brazil, United States of America and Chinese Taipei, to form the World Gateball Union (WGU). The WGU has since been joined by Bolivia (1987), Paraguay (1987), Peru (1987), Argentina (1989), Canada (1989), Singapore (1994), Hong Kong (1998), Australia (2003), Macao (2005), Philippines (2012) and Indonesia (2013). Gameplay Gateball is played between two teams of up to five people on a rectangular field 15-20 meters long and 20-25 wide. The two teams use five balls each, either red or white depending on the team, and play in an alternating fashion between red and white the balls numbered from 1 to 10. Each player plays the same ball throughout the game. At the beginning of the game the players, in order, place their ball in the designated ‚Äústart area‚Äù and attempt to hit the ball through the first gate. If they successfully pass through the gate they may play again. If the player misses the first gate, or their ball passes through the first gate but ends up outside of the court, they pick up their ball and have to try again in the second round.(Since the 2015 rule changes, a ball going through the first gate but ending up out of bounds is deemed to have passed Gate1 but is an outball and will attempt to enter court on their next turn from the place the ball went outball). When stroking, if the ball hits another ball, this is called a \\"touch\\". If both the stroker's ball and the touched ball remain within the inside line, the stroker shall step on the stroker's ball and place the other touched ball so that it is touching the stroker's ball, and hit the strokers ball with the stick (this play is called a ‚Äúspark‚Äù), sending the other touched ball off as the result of the impact. By passing through a gate or sparking the ball, a player receives another turn. One point is given for every gate the ball passes in order and two points for hitting the goal-pole. The winner is the team with the most points at the end of thirty minutes. As the red team always gets to play first, the white team always has the final turn, even if time has elapsed before the final white ball is called. Competitions World Games In 2001, gateball was included as an exhibition event at the 6th World Games. The competition was held in Akita Prefecture in Japan and was attended by teams from China, Japan, South Korea, the USA and Chinese Taipei. The final was won by a team of mostly teenage players from Japan. World Gateball Championship The World Gateball Championships are held every four years. The inaugural championship in 1986 was played in Hokkaido with teams from Brazil, China, Chinese Taipei, Japan, Korea and the United States of America. Subsequent championships were held in Hawaii (1998); Toyama, Japan (2002); Jeju, South Korea (2006); Shanghai, China( 2010); and Niigata (Japan) in 2014.

It is a major fork junction on the highway from Kochi, going east towards Muvattupuzha and south towards Kottayam. Karingachira serves as a terminus of the Airport‚ÄìSeaport road connecting Nedumbaseery and the Kochi port. Thiruvankulam's proximity to the city as well as industrial areas comprising the Kochi refineries and allied industries have contributed to its growth.

The legend behind this name is related to Lord Shiva and Parasurama Muni. The Siva temple at Thiruvankulam is one out of four other Siva temples, Parasurama Muni had built consecutively. Other 3 temples are Kureekkad, Perunninakulam and Trikkathara. It is believed that Muni saw Siva lying spread across all these places.

Adams began his career with the BBC Repertory Company in 1944. Among other early performances, he was leading man with Great Yarmouth Repertory Company for two years. In 1951, he joined the D'Oyly Carte organisation and soon began to play roles, becoming the company's principal bass until 1969. With Thomas Round and Norman Meadmore, he formed the touring company, Gilbert and Sullivan for All, in which he continued to sing bass and bass-baritone roles as well as directing. By the early 1980s, Adams was performing in opera and operetta throughout Britain and abroad, continuing nearly until his death. He recorded many of his roles, particularly his Gilbert and Sullivan repertoire. Beginnings and D'Oyly Carte years Donald Adams was born in Bristol and educated at the Bristol Cathedral School, where he sang as a chorister in the cathedral and played Thomas Becket in Murder in the Cathedral at the age of sixteen.Forbes, Elizabeth. \\"Obituary: Donald Adams\\", The Independent, 11 April 1996 While still at school, he made his first professional appearance as an actor in 1944 with the BBC Repertory Company.Stone, David.

This, Adams said, gave the voice \\"a nice line\\", and he continued to practise Melle's lessons until the end of his life.The Times, 16 April 1996 Adams interrupted his fledgling stage and radio career to serve in the British Army, where he acted as resident producer of the Army Repertory Theatre at Catterick Camp. After his national service, he returned to acting and music-hall performances, gaining good notices. For two years, he was leading man with Great Yarmouth Repertory Company and was a member of the quartet, The Regal Four. He also appeared in pantomime at the Euston Theatre in King's Cross. Kitty McShane asked Adams to go on tour with her and Arthur Lucan (Kitty and Old Mother Riley), during which Lucan suggested that Adams combine his singing and acting and audition for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.From Sullivan to Strauss, R [Interview with Alan Blyth]. Opera, March 1990, pp. 297‚Äì301. Adams was hired by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company as a chorister in 1951 and soon began to play the small roles of Bill Bobstay in H.M.S. Pinafore, Samuel in The Pirates of Penzance, Second Yeoman in The Yeomen of the Guard, and Antonio in The Gondoliers, eventually understudying 26 roles.Donald Adams at Memories of the D'Oyly Carte, accessed 10 February 2010 The next season, he took over the principal role of Captain Corcoran in H.M.S. Pinafore and substituted for the ailing Alan Styler as Cox in Cox and Box, the Counsel in Trial by Jury and Grosvenor in Patience. He also appeared once as Old Adam Goodheart in Ruddigore and soon began to play the Lieutenant of the Tower in The Yeomen of the Guard.Rollins and Witts, pp. 176‚Äì77 Adams also began to fill in for the ageing Darrell Fancourt, who missed an increasing number of performances, as the Pirate King in Pirates, Colonel Calverley in Patience, the Earl of Mountararat in Iolanthe, the title role in The Mikado and Sir Roderic Murgatroyd in Ruddigore. When Fancourt retired at the end of the 1952‚Äì53 season, Adams became the company's principal bass-baritone, regularly playing Dick Deadeye in H.M.S. Pinafore, the Pirate King, Colonel Calverley, the Earl of Mountararat, the Mikado of Japan, Sir Roderic in Ruddigore, Sergeant Meryll in The Yeomen of the Guard, and Arac in Princess Ida (when that opera was revived in 1954). From 1961 to 1963, he also played Sergeant Bouncer in Cox and Box.Rollins and Witts, pp. 177‚Äì86 Although he had admired Fancourt, when he took over the roles, Adams asked Bridget D'Oyly Carte if he could create his own characterisations, which she agreed to, saying she would tell him if he overstepped the mark. Adams continued as the principal bass-baritone of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company until 1969. In 1952 he married D'Oyly Carte soprano Muriel Harding (1920‚Äì90). After D'Oyly Carte In 1969, Adams began to perform full-time with Gilbert and Sullivan for All, a touring company that he had founded several years earlier with Norman Meadmore and Thomas Round.

Opera career and sudden death Beginning in the early 1980s, Adams began to perform in operettas and opera. He was invited by Matthew Epstein to sing the title role in the Peter Sellars version of The Mikado in Chicago in 1983, which led to many seasons there, including as Baron Zeta in The Merry Widow and the Theatre Director and the Banker in Lulu. He sang Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady for Scottish Opera in December 1983.

Returning to Covent Garden in 1993, he gave \\"excellent performances of Badger and the Priest\\" in The Cunning Little Vixen. Adams sang with English National Opera many times, beginning in 1985 as Dikoj in Katya Kabanova, Mozart's Bartolo in 1991 and 1993 (\\"the only truly rounded, Mozart-size performance is the Dr Bartolo of the immortal Donald Adams\\"),The Times, 1 November 1993 Pooh-Bah in The Mikado, Alcindoro/Benoit in La boh√®me in 1991, the Woodcutter in K√∂nigskinder in 1992, Mumlal in The Two Widows in 1993, Quince in A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1995, and Don Pasquale (1996).

His Baron Ochs in Der Rosenkavalier (1990) for WNO was described by The Independent as \\"a triumph for the singer, now 62 years of age, and no longer in his finest or freshest voice, but who made up for any vocal deficiency by the marvellously subtle way he handled the text\\". At Glyndebourne Festival beginning in 1988 he sang Quince, the lawyer Swallow in Peter Grimes, and Antonio in the production of The Marriage of Figaro which opened the new opera house at Glyndebourne in May 1994.The Sunday Times 21 July 1996 His other international work included Schigolch for Canadian Opera in 1991,Forbes, Elizabeth. \\"Donald Adams\\", Grove Music Online (subscription required), accessed 11 February 2010 Rossini's Bartolo in Amsterdam, the Sacristan in Tosca in Geneva (June 1987) and the Mikado in Los Angeles (with Dudley Moore).

His last appearance, only a month before his death, was with English National Opera in Don Pasquale. The Times, in its obituary of Adams, concluded: \\"At the time of his death Adams had a diary as packed as any leading opera singer half his age. He was particularly looking forward to a performance in Benjamin Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Metropolitan Opera\\". Adams also composed and arranged music. In his last years, Adams was president of the Cambridge University Gilbert and Sullivan Society.Committees , Cambridge University Gilbert and Sullivan Society, accessed 17 June 2012 He died in Norwich, England, at the age of 67 of a brain tumour.

On 1 February 1974, an air conditioning unit on the twelfth floor overheated, starting a fire. There were 756 people in the building at the time. Because flammable materials had been used to furnish the interior, the entire building was engulfed in flames within 20 minutes. The fire was extinguished at 1:30pm, with 179 deaths and 300 people injured. This happened less than two years after another deadly fire in downtown S√£o Paulo, that of the Andraus Building. As of 2019, the Joelma fire remains the second-worst skyscraper fire ever in terms of the death toll, after the collapse of the twin World Trade Center towers in New York City on September 11, 2001. Fire safety problems The Joelma Building is a reinforced fire-resistant concrete hull construction. So, the structure itself did not suffer enough damage from the fire to cause a collapse. However, the interior was furnished with flammable items. Partitions, desks and chairs were made of wood. The ceilings were cellulose fiber tiles set in wood strappings. The curtains and carpets were also flammable. At the time, no emergency lights, posted in fire alarms, fire sprinkler systems, or emergency exits were fitted to the building. There was only one stairwell, which ran the full height of the building. An air conditioner unit on the twelfth floor, which started the fire, needed a special type of circuit breaker, which was unavailable at the time it was installed. In order to use this unit, it was installed bypassing the twelfth floor electrical control panel. The fire The Joelma fire occurred on Friday, 1 February 1974. A short-circuit in a faulty air-conditioner on the 12th floor ignited the fire at 8:50 AM. The building was primarily occupied by a single banking company, Banco Crefisul S/A, of which 756 employees were present. A person in an adjacent building reported the fire and first fire personnel arrived on the scene at 9:10 AM. Assistance was requested and further units arrived at 9:30 AM, by which time flames were nearly to the roof of the building. The fire reached the building's only stairwell and climbed as high as the 15th floor. It did not reach any higher because of a lack of flammables in the stairwell, however it filled the stairwell with smoke and heat, making it impassable. The large amount of combustible materials, including paper, plastics, electrical equipment and wooden walls and furniture, contributed to the fire spreading rapidly. Fire crews attempted to gain access to the building using this stairwell, but could not go any higher than the 11th floor. Most importantly, the building had no emergency exits, fire alarms or fire sprinkler systems installed. Initial efforts led to the successful evacuation of some 300 employees before the heat and smoke became too overwhelming. Approximately three hundred people were evacuated using the elevators, a practice that is not recommended by fire officials. The four elevator operators were only able to make a few trips, however, before conditions within the building made it impossible to continue. Many remaining employees climbed onto balconies for air and a group of 171 individuals fled to the roof. A helicopter rescue was attempted but the heat, smoke and inadequate landing space prevented helicopters from reaching the roof until well after the fire had burned out at 10:30 AM. Even if landing space had been available, the strong heat and dense smoke made approaching the building by helicopter extremely hazardous. Despite the best efforts of rescue personnel and witnesses, who shouted and created signs encouraging people to remain calm, 40 individuals jumped to escape the conditions inside and in failed attempts to grasp unreachable fire ladders. None of these jumpers survived. Approximately 80 people hid under the tiles on the roof of the building; they were found alive. Thirteen people who tried to escape the fire using one of the elevators of the Joelma Building died of suffocation and their bodies were burnt by the fire. They were never identified. They are buried in anonymous graves at the Vila Alpina Cemetery.Geraldo Lu√≠s revive drama do inc√™ndio no edif√≠cio Joelma, de 1974 By 10:30 am, the fire subsided. Two hours later, it had engulfed all flammables and simply burned itself out. Medical teams, fire crews and police were then able to enter the office towers and search for survivors. At the time, this had been the greatest death toll in any high-rise building fire. Death toll estimates range from 179Craighead, Geoff. High-Rise Security and Fire Life Safety. 3rd ed., illustrated.

After the fire After the disaster the Joelma Building remained closed for 4 years for reconstruction. Once reconstructed, it was renamed Pra√ßa da Bandeira (\\"Flag Square,\\" the name of a former square facing the building). The Joelma fire became a landmark case that led to changes in fire safety regulations not only in Brazil, but all over the world. For instance, Los Angeles enacted Regulation 10, which mandated all new buildings taller than to have a rooftop helipad for emergency fire evacuation. The regulation was created in response to the Joelma fire. Regulation 10 was rescinded in 2014, after petitioning by the builders of the 73 story Wilshire Grand Center building, who designed in a reinforced concrete central core into the building. In 2013, newspaper Folha de S. Paulo asked a fire safety specialist to inspect both the Joelma and Andraus buildings. He found that the renovated Joelma exceeded current fire safety regulations, many of which were enacted exactly because of the two fires. Joelma even had tactile floors for blind people in the escape routes; this is not mandatory. Andraus failed the same inspection. Footage and survivor testimony were included in the 1977 film Catastrophe, hosted by William Conrad.

Tiruvidaimarudur has a rich heritage of fertility and people have habit of harvesting thrice in a year. Sometimes the River Cauvery makes a fourth harvest possible.. Tiruvidaimarudur has a Siva Temple namely Mahalingha Swamy with the Goddess Brahath Sundara Gujambal(In Tamil, it is Perunala Mamulai Ammai). Shiva is worshiped as Mahalingeswaraswamy, and is represented by the lingam. This lingam, known as Jothimayalingam is ‚Äúbelieved to be the focal point for the seven consorts of Shiva.‚Äù The Nandhi in the Temple is one of the largest in the district, of course it is not made of a single stone, that is why it is not weighted more than the Brahdeshwara Temple at Tanjore though it is bigger in size than that. There is a separate Sannathi for \\"Moogambigai\\" with Maha Meru. A large number of devotees visit this temple for relief from Bramha hatya Dosha. There are 149 inscriptions found in the temple which indicate the ‚Äúcontributions from Pandyas, Cholas, Thanjavur Nayaks and Thanjavur Maratha kingdom.‚Äù The present masonry structure of the temple was built during the Chola dynasty in the 9th century. Later the Thanjavur Nayaks expanded the temple during the 16th century. Two temple festivals are being celebrated for 10 days - \\"Thai Poosam\\" In January- February and another one, Thirukkalyana Uthsavam (Vasantha utsavam) in Vaigasi (May). 63 Nayanmar Ula and Aruthra Darshan( like in Chidambaram) are the other two important temple festivals. There are 27 star lingas, the prince \\"Ammani Ammal\\" Vigragam and Chitra prakaram(enclosed precincts of a temple) which is full of painting. There are several charitable trusts, one of them being \\"Pachhiyappa Mudhaliyar ArakattaLai\\".

This temple also known for giving redemption to King Varaguna Pandiya from his \\"Brahmahati DhOsham\\", and there is a belief still prevalent that any kind of evil spirit will leave when you touch the place. It is a popular belief that Lord Mahalingam cures the lunatic when they circum-ambulate the temple.

The name Pattinathar was an honorific that came about through common usage of the way people referred to him. Since the city was known as Kaveri Poom-Pattinam, the sage was referred to as \\"Pattinathar\\", the One who hails from the city. This is generally because it is considered impolite to address or refer to a revered person by name.

Biography Ordained during the latter part of Queen Mary Tudor's reign, he was a Lincolnshire rector for under a year, and in 1560 acted as a private tutor in Wales.\\"Blessed Thomas Woodhouse.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 9 August 2018 However, he resigned that post as well over religious differences. On 14 May 1561, he was committed to the Fleet, London, having been arrested while saying Mass. For the rest of his life he remained in custody, uncompromising in his opposition to heresy, saying Mass in secret daily, and reciting his Office regularly. In early May 1571, having heard that John Story (martyr) had been condemned to death for having supported the Rising of the North two years before, Woodhouse offered to take Story's place on the scaffold.Del Re, Niccol√≤. \\"Beato Tommaso Woodhouse\\", Santi e Beati, 2 March 2009 After secret negotiations with the Jesuit Provincial of Paris, he was welcomed by letter into the Society of Jesus, (although the Decree of the Congregation of Rites, 4 December 1886, describes him as a secular priest.) Treated with considerable leniency till 19 November 1572, he sent the prison washerwoman to Lord Burghley's house with his famous letter. In it he begs him to seek reconciliation with the pope and earnestly to \\"persuade the Lady Elizabeth, who for her own great disobedience is most justly deposed, to submit herself unto her spiritual prince and father\\". Some days later in a personal interview he used equally definite language. Confined then by himself he wrote \\"divers papers, persuading men to the true faith and obedience\\", which he signed, tied to stones, and flung into the street. He was repeatedly examined both publicly and privately. The Queen's private council was inclined to dismiss him as mad. Once, when he had denied the queen's title, someone said, \\"If you saw her Majesty, you would not say so, for her Majesty is great\\". \\"But the Majesty of God is greater\\", he answered. Tried in mid-April 1573 at the Guildhall, Woodhouse not only refused to recognize the authority of the judges, but also challenged the jurisdiction of the secular court to judge a priest. Found guilty of treason, he was executed at Tyburn on 19 June 1573. He defiantly argued that the queen needed to beg pardon from the Pope, leading some in the crowd to cry out \\"hang him, hang him, this man is worse than Story\\". Thomas Woodhouse was proclaimed \\"blessed\\" by Pope Leo XIII in 1886; the Jesuits consider him the protomartyr of the Company on English soil. Woodhouse is commemorated on 19 June.

His nickname is The Tin Man.Ted McMinn profile on \\"Queens legends\\" on the official Queen of the South FC website Playing career Early years Born in Castle Douglas and raised in nearby Dumfries, McMinn was alleged by The Scotsman to be called 'Teddy' at school because he ran as if he had a teddy bear tucked under his arm. In his autobiography McMinn stated it was because as a toddler he and his teddy bear were inseparable. McMinn started his playing career at Scottish junior side Glenafton Athletic in 1981. McMinn joined Glenafton from Dumfries High School FPs along with teammate Stewart Cochrane. Queen of the South McMinn returned to south-west Scotland joining Dumfries club Queen of the South in 1982. At Queens he became a teammate of Cochrane's for the third time. The transfer fee was, \\"¬£325 so that Glenafton could buy a new carpet for their club house and 1,000 Queens lottery tickets.\\" When McMinn debuted in 1982‚Äì83 it was for a Queens team who had just been relegated after one season in the middle of Scottish football's three divisions ‚Äì a season where Willie Harkness and his fellow directors had decided to run the club without a manager and select the team themselves. McMinn's debut was in the 1‚Äì1 draw versus Meadowbank Thistle on 6 November. McMinn remained with Queens until October 1984.\\"The Queens\\" by Iain McCartney on Creedon Publications, 2004 McMinn returned to Palmerston Park under the new regime of Norman Blount to play for a Queen of the South select on 23 April 1995. The opposition in the 2‚Äì2 draw was Rangers in a game to mark Queens' 75th anniversary and the opening of the new stand. Other guests for Queens included Andy Thomson, Davie Irons and Rowan Alexander. When later interviewed for the club, Jimmy Robertson, Alan Davidson and George Cloy were among those McMinn named as the best players he played beside at Palmerston. Rangers Glasgow side Rangers, managed by Jock Wallace, signed him for ¬£100,000. His style of wing play quickly made McMinn a fans favourite at Ibrox as per previous Rangers wingers such as Davie Wilson, Willie Henderson, Willie Johnston and Davie Cooper. McMinn was also noted for his performances against Rangers' rivals Celtic, playing in a number of Old Firm matches including the 1987 League Cup final win. McMinn's debut came as a substitute on Saturday, 13 October 1984 in a 2‚Äì0 win at St Mirren. In McMinn's full Rangers debut against Dumbarton at Boghead he scored direct from a corner kick. Former teammate Derek Ferguson recalled, \\"I'll never forget playing with Ted in a reserve game at Ibrox. He was running down the wing full speed and crossed the ball into the box. He just kept running so he had to jump over a wall into the Copland Road stand, carried on up the stairs then disappeared down the other side.\\" Graeme Souness succeeded Jock Wallace as Rangers manager in April 1986. Souness went on to remark, \\"How can I tell Ted McMinn what to do when he doesn't know what he's going to do?\\" Rangers were Scottish Champions in 1986‚Äì87 for the first time in nine seasons. Under Souness McMinn had not played enough league games to qualify for a medal. McMinn was involved in an incident outside an East Kilbride nightclub in the early hours of 5 December 1986. McMinn believes the incident led to his own removal from the club by his manager Graeme Souness.Tin Man admits Souness was right to show him the door at Ibrox The Scotsman, 24 October 2008 McMinn later said of his time at Rangers, \\"Davie Cooper was my hero and we got on well.\\" He added, \\"I wasn't getting on with Souness. I was stepping out of line too often.\\" Sevilla McMinn joined Spanish club Sevilla on 1 August 1987, again signed by Jock Wallace. A Spanish journalist observed, \\"With his inelegant Tin Man running style, erratic crossing and unquenchable zest for lager, he was the soul of football. He broke his leg three weeks after signing but he recovered to play 22 league games. The departure from the club of Wallace unsettled McMinn. Despite public protests at his impending departure McMinn decided to return to the UK. Derby County McMinn emulated fellow ex Queen of the South player Hughie Gallacher by joining Derby County. This was on 5 February 1988 for ¬£300,000 where he also became a fans favourite. He arrived at the Baseball Ground in Derby's first season back in the First Division after a seven-year exile. Arthur Cox landed the flying winger and was rewarded with a series of outstanding performances from the Scotsman. McMinn's Derby debut came in a 2‚Äì1 defeat at Portsmouth the day after he signed. The home debut came in a 2‚Äì1 defeat by Manchester United in which he scored the best goal of his career. Along with Peter Shilton, Mark Wright and Dean Saunders the club finished fifth in 1989. With English clubs banned from Europe at the time McMinn missed out on a UEFA Cup place. In November 1989 ‚Äì with McMinn on the verge of a call-up to the national side ahead of the 1990 FIFA World Cup ‚Äì he was struck by a serious knee injury in an away game against Tottenham Hotspur. McMinn was out for 14 months. A lack of further investment from chairman Robert Maxwell led to a decline shortly after. The Rams were relegated at the end of the 1990‚Äì91 season (with McMinn making his return to the side in the January), just after Maxwell sold the club to new owner Lionel Pickering. McMinn was back to his best form in 1991‚Äì92 when he was named as the club's player of the year, having helped them to the playoff semi finals. They were knocked out by eventual winners Blackburn Rovers . He remained with the Rams for a further season, 1992‚Äì93, playing 19 league games and scoring twice as the Rams finished eighth ‚Äì a major disappointment for a side who began the season as promotion favourites. He left on 28 July 1993 in a ¬£115,000 move to Birmingham City. In November 2004 Igor Stimac was voted Derby County's all-time cult hero by BBC's Football Focus viewers. Stimac won with 59% of the vote, ahead of Ted McMinn who came second with 30%. Birmingham City Ted McMinn had one season with Birmingham City signing on 28 July 1993. Burnley He joined Burnley on 5 April 1994 for two years. Burnley were on a push for promotion that saw them achieve a play off place. McMinn played in the play off final 2‚Äì1 victory at Wembley against Stockport County before a crowd of 44,806. Despite only two seasons at Turf Moor McMinn came third in the BBC Football Focus Burnley cult heroes poll behind Jimmy McIlroy and Leighton James. Later playing career Ted McMinn ended his playing career with Australian club ECU Joondalup and then Slough Town. At Slough Town during the 1996‚Äì97 season, although slowing down, he played a holding role, often restarting attacks which had broken down. He was revered by the die hards who would sing his nickname Tin Man, to the tune of Stingray. Being a humourist, Ted would have appreciated this. When questioned whether McMinn was a \\"micky taker,\\" teammate Mark Fiore replied sardonically \\"yes.\\" At the end of the season he retired due to arthritis of the knee. Coaching career As assistant to Mark Wright McMinn had a spell coaching at Southport. Wright left to manage his former club Oxford United in June 2001. McMinn went with him. Oxford had just been relegated to the fourth tier of English Football. After an unremarkable start to the season Wright parted with the club in December amid allegations of racial abuse against a match official. Again McMinn followed Wright out the door. McMinn appeared again on 17 January 2002 when Wright soon took over at Conference strugglers Chester City. The club avoided relegation as the pair set about turning the club's fortunes around. McMinn then parted company with both Wright and Chester when he departed in July 2002.  Life after football  In 2004 McMinn became the match summariser for BBC Radio Derby, working alongside Ross Fletcher.McMinn to summarise for BBC Radio Derby This is Derbyshire In his three years with the station he attended all Derby County's matches. McMinn contracted a mystery infection that led to most of his right foot being amputated. McMinn then opted to have more of his leg removed in a bid to gain more mobility and independence with a prosthetic limb. As a tribute to McMinn, on 1 May 2006, former players of both Derby County and Rangers contested a match at Derby County's Pride Park Stadium in which a record 33,475 spectators attended ‚Äì around 10,000 of them being Rangers fans. McMinn said to the Scottish press that he had also received well wishes from Queen of the South fans. Terry Butcher recalled after the benefit game, \\"Nigel Spackman said to the physio (at the match) he had a tight calf, Ted said 'So have I' and lifted his trouser leg up and there is just the metal stump there. It does make you think. You never know what can happen to you.\\" To coincide with the benefit game McMinn embarked on a 300-mile sponsored bike ride from Glasgow to Derby to help raise money for the Derbyshire Royal Infirmary's limbs unit. He left Radio Derby after only the first game of the 2007‚Äì08 season, saying he felt \\"let down\\" and undervalued by the station following contract negotiations.McMinn leaves Radio Derby This is Derbyshire It was announced in the Derby Evening Telegraph on 13 February 2007 that McMinn has started up a courier and taxi business. The Wisden Cricketer magazine reported that in 2011, McMinn was employed as full-time kit-man by Derbyshire County Cricket Club. His LinkedIn account states he left that role in 2013.

Danonaselo is a very specific proper name given by San Damon to this sculpture. All the difficulty comes from the fact that Damon had to move from 2D drawing to 3D sculpture with the particular twists and angles that emerge from the strange character. Indeed, the night lighting surrounding the Danonaselo and the daylight that illuminates it, and in particular the presence of the sun that revolves around it, makes us see a totally different character. Shadows are thrown to the ground and angles are projected on the facades. The Danonaselo is placed for life in a public square in Portugal, in Fi√£es in the entity of Santa Maria da Feira and is part of the Portuguese heritage.

It is surrounded by sripuram in the south, Allapuram in the north, Otteri-Bagayam in the east and Great Thorapadi Lake in the west. Ram Chandrasekaran a native of this place informs that there is no recorded history for the name reference for Thorapadi. Padi is the common name for residential areas in Agricultural adjoining Hilly areas(cf: Hindi/Sanskrit Pahad meaning Hill) and that is why we find many villages having suffix 'padi' in Tamil Land viz.Velapadi, Katpadi etc. Thorapadi would have derived its name from Thiru Padi and now corrupted to form Thorapadi. Thiru is a common name for almost all towns and cities in Tamil Nadu viz. Thiruvannamalai, Thirupattur and there are so many places starting with Prefix Thiru meaning 'the blessed'. The prominence of the place can be traced back to Britishers establishing a Central Prison during the 1800s. Neighborhoods Thorapadi can be subdivided into crowded north and relatively well planned south. Azad Road is the arterial road of Thorapadi. Other important roads are Nethaji Street, Jail Road, Usur Road, CMC-Thanthai Periyar College Road (Hill Road), Pillayar Koil Street (derives its name from the Pillayar temple located at the far end of the street) and Periya Theru(big street).
