History  The village derives its name from its location west of the original settlement of Celle, now called Altencelle (\\"Old Celle\\"). The first houses were built on the banks of the river. Westercelle developed into a purely agricultural, relatively large village with farms on both sides of the road running from Celle south towards Hanover, which later became the B 3 federal road. Individual farmsteads still exist in the suburb. In 1974 the village was incorporated into the town of Celle.  Religion  The mother church of the Lutheran parish of Westercelle is the Christ Church (Christuskirche).  Politics  The chair of the local council (Ortsb√ºrgermeister) is Michael Schwarz.  Coat of arms  The green shield of the village coat of arms is divided diagonally from top left by a wavy white line that symbolises the river Fuhse. Above is a white horses' head, below a white lime tree leaf.  Economy and infrastructure   Road  Since the 1970s industry and commerce has settled in the new trading estates sited in favourable locations next to the B 3. The trading estates include Street One and trispel. Following completion of the second section of the eastern ring road in 2011 Westercelle should be relieved of its heavy through traffic.  Rail  The Deutsche Bahn (DB)'s S-Bahn line from Celle via Burgdorf and Lehrte to Hanover runs towards the west through this part of Celle. The nearest station is Celle (occasional Intercityexpress, InterCity and S-Bahn trains).

Qi was a member of the ultra-left Cultural Revolution Group, director of the Department of Petitions and deputy director of the Secretary Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Qi also acted as head of the history department of the communist theory journal Red Flag. In 1968 he was arrested, stripped of all his positions, and sent to prison.  Life   Youth  Born in Weihai, Shandong Province, Qi Benyu attended the Central School of the Communist Youth League of China and entered the Communist Party of China in the early 1950s when still being a student. Upon graduation he became assistant to Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao Zedong. In 1963 he wrote an article on Li Xiucheng, which for the first time gave him Mao's approval for his radical approach. He became a member of the Board of Editors of the Party journal Red Flag. There, on 8 December 1965, following Yao Wenyuan's \\"Criticism of Hai Rui Dismissed from Office\\", he published the article \\"Study History for the Revolution\\", in which he criticised the most famous Historians of the time by denouncing their Historism as Capitalist. The article was mainly aimed at Jian Bozan but did not name him. Mao very much appreciated the article, praising the author: \\"Who are today's Authorities? It's Yao Wenyuan, Qi Benyu, Yin Da... People of low age, low knowledge, sturdy opinions and stable political experiences\\".\\"Áé∞Âú®ÁöÑÊùÉÂ®ÅÊòØË∞ÅÔºüÊòØÂßöÊñáÂÖÉ„ÄÅÊàöÊú¨Á¶π„ÄÅÂ∞πËææ......Ë¶ÅÂπ¥Á∫™Â∞èÁöÑ„ÄÅÂ≠¶ÈóÆÂ∞ëÁöÑ„ÄÅÁ´ãÂú∫Á®≥ÁöÑ„ÄÅÊúâÊîøÊ≤ªÁªèÈ™åÁöÑÂùöÂÆöÁöÑ‰∫∫Êù•Êé•Áè≠„ÄÇ\\", Cited according to Ding Shu: ‰ªé‚ÄúÂè≤Â≠¶Èù©ÂëΩ‚ÄùÂà∞‚ÄúÊåñÁ•ñÂùü‚Äù, online: PDF, p. 3 Qi thereupon followed with Articles attacking Wu Han and again Jian Bozan, this time by name. Both Articles were also published in the People's Daily and gave Qi his reputation as a radical theorist.  Political ascendancy  Qi Benyu's sudden rise in the hierarchy of the Communist Party began in mid-1966 with the proclamation of the Cultural Revolution. In May, Qi was appointed member of the Cultural Revolution Group and only shortly afterwards deputy director of the Secretary Bureau (mishuju; Áßò‰π¶Â±Ä) of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Acting Director of the Secretary Bureau. At the Red Flag, he rose to Deputy Editor-in-Chief. Also still in 1966 he became secretary of Mao and his wife Jiang Qing. With the Articles and Speeches written by him he played a large role in the campaigns against Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping and the old Establishment of the Party as well as in heating up the atmosphere during the Cultural Revolution. His arguably most important Article during this time was Patriotism or National Betrayal? --On the Reactionary Film Inside Story of the Ching Court Full Article in English translation on wengewang.org published on March 30, 1967 in the Red Flag. Highly appraised by Mao, the article also appeared in the People's Daily and initiated a new wave of campaigns against Liu Shaoqi, to whom the article refers to as \\"the biggest capitalist roader in the Party\\" and \\"China's Khrushchev\\".Guo Jian, Yongyi Song, Yuan Zhou (Hrsg.): Historical dictionary of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, - Lanham: Scarecrow Press, 2006, p. 229 (eng) Qi then began to directly intervene in politics by inciting Red Guards to forcefully bring Peng Dehuai back from Sichuan and to enter the Governmental District of Beijing, Zhongnanhai, to attack Liu, Deng, Zhu De and Tao Zhu.  Wang-Guan-Qi-Affair  From 1967 on Qi, together with Wang Li, Guan Feng and other members of the Cultural Revolution Group, started to accelerate Mao's plans for implementing the Cultural Revolution in the Army too, and where calling for the peoples to find out the \\"few Capitalist Roaders\\" within the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The same Radicalisation was to be achieved in Foreign Policy, which culminated in the attack on the British Embassy in Beijing on August 22. For Mao now saw himself confronted with growing opposition inside the Party and chaotic turbulences in his most important power base, the army, he decided to let down the so-called ‚ÄûThree Small‚Äú, Wang, Guan and Qi. Qi was arrested on January 13, 1968 and lost all positions in- and outside the party. All three of them were brought to the notorious Qincheng Prison. Jiang Qing was disclosing the main charge in a speech in front of officers of the PLA: The \\"Wang-Guan-Qi-Anti-Party-Clique\\" would have been working secretly for Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping and Tao Zhu since the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. Though staying in prison all the time, it was only on July 14, 1980 that Qi was officially arrested by the Beijing Police. On November 2, 1983 the Intermediate People's Court Beijing sentenced him to 18 years in prison on terms of being a member of the counterrevolutionary clique of Lin Biao and Jiang Qing as well as 'counterrevolutionary propaganda', 'wrong accusations' and 'inciting of the masses' (da-za-qiang). Having by then already spent 15 years in prison, he was discharged after 3 more years in 1986. Post prison One event in his post prison years was his criticism of Li Zhisui's biography of the private life of Mao. Despite his persecution at the hand of Mao, Qi criticised Li's portrayal of the Chinese leader, claiming that \\"aside from his account of the support- the-left activities (zhi zuo) in which he [Li] personally participated, most of the Cultural Revolution part of his memoirs consists of stuff gleaned from newspapers, journals and other people's writings. To make Western readers believe that he had access to core secrets, Li fabricated scenarios, resulting in countless errors in his memoirs.\\" Having lived in proximity to Mao for a number of years, Qi remarked that during this time he heard no rumour of Mao ever having extra-marital affairs despite the fact that other senior Party members were known to, and that Mao was always respectful towards \\"female comrades\\". Due to this and other reasons, Qi believed Li's claim that Mao had affairs was a lie. However, Qi was an unrepentant Maoist, and after prison he moved to Shanghai and continued to express support for Maoist doctrine. Ye Yonglie, a writer who befriended Qi, remarked upon Qi's death: ‚ÄúTill his death, Qi Benyu remained a leftist. ‚ÄúHe never wavered from insisting on the rightness of Mao Zedong and his ideas.‚Äù  Death  Qi died on 20 April 2016 at the age of 85 in Shanghai.Last member of China‚Äôs Cultural Revolution Group, Qi Benyu, dies at 85  References   External links  * ÁéãÂäõÂÖ≥ÈîãÊàöÊú¨Á¶πÔºö‚ÄúÊñáÈù©‚Äù‰∏âÂ§ßÂπ≤Â∞ÜÁöÑ‰∫∫ÁîüÁªìÂ±Ä Category:Maoist theorists Category:Anti-revisionists Category:People of the Cultural Revolution Category:1931 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Politicians from Weihai Category:Communist Party of China politicians from Shandong Category:Chinese politicians convicted of crimes Category:Chinese Maoists ","title":"Qi Benyu"},{"id":"24398114","text":"The 3rd Earl Nelson \\"The noblest of English names\\" Lord Nelson as caricatured by 'Spy' (Sir Leslie Ward) in Vanity Fair, April 1881 Horatio Nelson, 3rd Earl Nelson, (7 August 1823 ‚Äì 25 February 1913), was a British politician.

Ida is a strong-willed, single, middle-aged woman who has found her own ways of surviving in the Communist-run society (which sometimes involves her charming powerful older men, as well as maintaining two different sets of identity papers). She gets Hubert admitted to one of the city's best schools by portraying him as the orphan of a war hero. But she also shares with him her own passion for horses, at a time when riding is seen by many officials as a relic of the old aristocratic class. Hubert himself, meanwhile, struggles to understand how it can be right for a good Catholic to lie in order to survive under Communism.\\"In Full Gallop\\" {alternative title}: Overview. Movies.

In the absence of the metal ion, the same organic reactants produce different products. The term is mainly used in coordination chemistry. The template effects emphasizes the pre-organization provided by the coordination sphere, although the coordination modifies the electronic properties (acidity, electrophilicity, etc.) of ligands. An early example is the dialkylation of a nickel dithiolate: :center The corresponding alkylation in the absence of a metal ion would yield polymers. Crown ethers arise from dialkylations that are templated by alkali metals. Other template reactions include the Mannich and Schiff base condensations.Otilia Costisor, W. Linert \\"Metal mediated template synthesis of ligands\\" World Scientific Publisher, Singapore, 2004. The condensation of formaldehyde, ammonia, and tris(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III) to give a clathrochelate complex is one example. 18-Crown-6 can be synthesized by the Williamson ether synthesis using potassium ion as the template cation. 2-aminobenzaldehyde. The phosphorus analogue of an aza crown can be prepared by a template reaction. where it is not possible to isolate the phosphine itself. Scheme 4. Phosphacrown Limitations Many template reactions are only stoichiometric, and the decomplexation of the \\"templating ion\\" can be difficult. The alkali metal-templated syntheses of crown ether syntheses are notable exceptions. Metal Phthalocyanines are generated by metal-templated condensations of phthalonitriles, but the liberation of metal-free phthalocyanine is difficult. Some so-called template reactions proceed similarly in the absence of the templating ion. One example being the condensation of acetone and ethylenediamine, which yields isomeric 14-membered tetraaza rings.N.F. Curtis \\"Macrocyclic coordination compounds formed by condensation of metal-amine complexes with aliphatic carbonyl compounds\\" Coordination Chemistry Reviews, 1968 Volume 3, pp. 3-47. Similarly, porphyrins, which feature 16-membered central rings, form in the absence of metal templates. 14-membered N4 macrocyclic ligands, called Curtis macrocycles, arise from the condensation of acetone and a nickel complex of ethylenediamine. Concept in catalysis In a general sense, transition metal-based catalysis can be viewed as template reactions: Reactants coordinate to adjacent sites on the metal ion and, owing to their adjacency, the two reactants interconnect (insert or couple) either directly or via the action of another reagent. In the area of homogeneous catalysis, the cyclo- oligomerization of acetylene to cyclooctatetraene at a nickel(II) centre reflects the templating effect of the nickel, where it is supposed that four acetylene molecules occupy four sites around the metal and react simultaneously to give the product. This simplistic mechanistic hypotheses was influential in the development of these catalytic reactions. For example, if a competing ligand such as triphenylphosphine were added to occupy one coordination site, then only three molecules of acetylene could bind, and these come together to form benzene (see Reppe chemistry).

Flood was a 1976 court case in the state of California involving child abuse and alleged medical malpractice. In 1971, Gita Landeros, a minor, was seen in the emergency room by Dr. Flood for injuries inflicted by her mother and the mother's common law husband. Dr. Flood failed to diagnose \\"battered child syndrome\\" and also did not report the injuries to proper civil authorities in violation of California law. The child was released to the custody of her mother and the mother's common law husband, where she experienced further injury at their hands. The parents fled the state, but were apprehended and convicted of criminal child abuse. Gita Landeros brought a civil suit in tort for damages against Dr. Flood. The trial court dismissed her case as a matter of law. The case was appealed and decided in 1976 by the California Supreme Court. Overview GITA LANDEROS, Appellant, a minor, sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), which sustained general demurrers and dismissed her medical malpractice action against appellees, a physician and a hospital, for injuries sustained when they failed to properly diagnose and treat the condition from which she was suffering. Appellant minor argued trial court error in sustaining the demurrer of appellees, doctor and hospital, to her malpractice suit against them, because issues existed as to whether they had a duty to recognize a case of battered child syndrome that was to be reported to authorities, and whether their conduct proximately caused appellant's injuries. The court agreed, noting first that appellant was returned to parental custody after having been treated for injuries not appearing to be accidental, and that she then was traumatically abused. Because it was unclear whether treating physicians should have recognized the syndrome for treatment purposes, appellant was entitled to prove by expert testimony the standard of care against which appellees were to be held. And as appellees could not escape liability if it was foreseeable that appellant would suffer further injury, appellant was entitled to prove that appellees' conduct proximately caused her injuries, even if the parent's intervening act was the actual cause. Finally, appellant was entitled to show that appellees failed to exercise due care in not reporting her injuries to authorities who would have shielded her from further harm. Issues #Is there a duty for a physician to recognize a case of battered child syndrome (child abuse) and report it to the appropriate authorities? #Does medical standard of care dictate recognition of child abuse? #Should the appellant (Landeros) have been allowed to introduce expert testimony concerning standard of care in her malpractice action? #Was further injury from child abuse foreseeable? #Did the appellant's actions of allowing Landeros to return to the care of her abusive parents proximately cause her subsequent injuries, even if the parent's intervening actions in harming her were the actual cause of her injuries? #Did the appellants fail to show due care by not reporting Landeros' injuries to authorities who could have prevented further injury? Holdings #It is established standard of care for physicians to suspect, work-up and diagnose child abuse when such a case presents in the emergency room or physician's office. #California statutory requirements obligate the physician to report suspected cases of child abuse to the proper civil authorities. Failure to do so is a violation of law. #The summary dismissal of the complaint and allegation that the failure to diagnose child abuse and report it alleging this to be the proximate cause of the plaintiff's subsequent injuries was reversible error by the trial court. #The failure to allow the plaintiff to introduce expert testimony was reversible error. #The issue of foreseeability in negligence cases is a question for the jury under California law, and this applies to the actions of third parties. Facts and background Plaintiff brought the action by her guardian ad litem against A. J. Flood, a physician, and The San Jose Hospitals & Health Center, Inc. (hereinafter called the San Jose Hospital). The amended complaint purports to allege four \\"causes of action.\\" of recovery alleged in support of a single cause of action for compensatory damages for personal injuries caused by defendants' negligence in failing to properly diagnose and treat the condition from which plaintiff was suffering; the fourth \\"cause of action\\" merely adds a claim for punitive damages on allegations that defendants' conduct in this respect was wilful and wanton. Defendants filed general demurrers. The court sustained the demurrers as to the first and second \\"causes of action\\" with leave to amend, and as to the third and fourth \\"causes of action\\" without leave to amend. Plaintiff elected to stand on her complaint as previously amended, and a judgment dismissing the entire action was therefore entered. On this appeal plaintiff has expressly abandoned her claim of punitive damages. The material factual allegations of the amended complaint are as follows. Plaintiff was born on May 14, 1970. On repeated occasions during the first year of her life she was severely beaten by her mother and the latter's common law husband, one Reyes. On April 26, 1971, when the plaintiff was eleven months old, her mother took her to the San Jose Hospital for examination, diagnosis, and treatment. The attending physician was defendant Dr. Flood, acting on his own behalf and as agent of the defendant San Jose Hospital. At the time, the plaintiff was suffering from a comminuted spiral fracture of the right tibia and fibula, which gave the appearance of having been caused by a twisting force. Plaintiff's mother had no explanation for this injury. Plaintiff had bruises over her entire body. In addition, she had a non-depressed linear skull fracture which was then in the process of healing. Plaintiff demonstrated fear and apprehension when approached. Inasmuch as all plaintiff's injuries gave the appearance of having been intentionally inflicted by other persons, she exhibited the medical condition known as the battered child syndrome. Landeros presented to the emergency room with a spiral fracture of the tibia, among other injuries. It is alleged that proper diagnosis of plaintiff's condition would have included taking X-rays of her entire skeletal structure, and that such procedure would have revealed the fracture of her skull. Defendants negligently failed to take such X-rays, and thereby negligently failed to diagnose her true condition. It is further alleged that proper medical treatment of plaintiff's battered child syndrome would have included reporting her injuries to local law enforcement authorities or juvenile probation department. Such a report would have resulted in an investigation by the concerned agencies, followed by a placement of plaintiff in protective custody until her safety was assured. Defendants negligently failed to make such report. The complaint avers that as a proximate result of the foregoing negligence plaintiff was released from the San Jose Hospital without proper diagnosis and treatment of her battered child syndrome, and was returned to the custody of her mother and Reyes who resumed physically abusing her until she sustained traumatic blows to her right eye and back, puncture wounds over her left lower leg and across her back, severe bites on her face, and second and third degree burns on her left hand. On July 1, 1971, plaintiff was again brought in for medical care, but to a different doctor and hospital. Her battered child syndrome was immediately diagnosed and reported to local police and juvenile probation authorities, and she was taken into protective custody. Following hospitalization and surgery she was placed with foster parents, and the latter subsequently undertook proceedings to adopt her. Plaintiff's mother and Reyes fled the state, but were apprehended, returned for trial, and convicted of the crime of child abuse.Pen. Code, ¬ß 273a. With respect to damages the complaint alleges that as a proximate result of defendants' negligence plaintiff suffered painful permanent physical injuries and great mental distress, including the probable loss of use or amputation of her left hand. The second and third \\"causes of action\\" are predicated on defendants' failure to comply with three related sections of the Penal Code. Section 11160 provides in relevant part that every hospital to which any person is brought who is suffering from any injuries inflicted \\"in violation of any penal law of this State\\" must report that fact immediately, by telephone and in writing, to the local law enforcement authorities. Section 11161 imposes the identical duty on every physician who has under his care any person suffering from any such injuries. Section 11161.5 deals specifically with child abuse, and declares in pertinent part that in any case in which a minor is under a physician's care or is brought to him for diagnosis, examination or treatment, and \\"it appears to the physician\\" from observation of the minor that the latter has any physical injuries \\"which appear to have been inflicted upon him by other than accidental means by any person,\\" he must report that fact by telephone and in writing to the local law enforcement authorities and the juvenile probation department. All three sections require the report to state the name of the victim, if known, together with his whereabouts and the character and extent of his injuries; and a violation of any of the sections is a misdemeanor (¬ß 11162). Among such laws are the statutes penalizing child abuse.Pen. Code, ¬ß 273a, 273d The statute imposes the same duty on certain other health care professionals, school officials and teachers, child care supervisors, and social workers. The trial court did not allow Gita Landeros to present expert testimony supporting her allegations of negligence against Dr. Flood. The trial court also dismissed the complaint of Gita Landeros as a matter of law. The decision is appealed to the California Supreme Court. Opinion Opinion written by Chief Judge Mosk: By means of allegations phrased largely in the statutory language plaintiff undertakes to charge defendants with a duty to comply with section 11161.5 (second \\"cause of action\\") and sections 11160 and 11161 (third \\"cause of action\\"), and avers that they failed to make the reports thus required by law. Her allegations of proximate cause and damages on these counts are essentially identical to those of the first count. We have found no case directly in point, but the issues may be decided by reference to well settled principles. Succinctly stated, the rules governing our consideration of this appeal are \\"that a general demurrer admits the truth of all material factual allegations in the complaint [citation]; that the question of plaintiff's ability to prove these allegations, or the possible difficulty in making such proof does not concern the reviewing court [citations here omitted]; and that plaintiff need only plead facts showing that [may be shown to be relevant during the trial.] The standard of care in malpractice cases is also well known. With unimportant variations in phrasing, we have consistently held that a physician is required to possess and exercise, in both diagnosis and treatment, etc. In this medical malpractice action plaintiff Gita Landeros, a minor, appeals from a judgment of dismissal entered upon an order sustaining general demurrers to her amended complaint. As will appear, we have concluded that the complaint states a cause of action and hence that the judgment must be reversed. Plaintiff brought the action by her guardian ad litem against A. J. Flood, a physician, and The San Jose Hospitals & Health Center, Inc. (hereinafter called the San Jose Hospital). The amended complaint purports to allege four \\"causes of action.\\" of recovery alleged in support of a single cause of action for compensatory damages for personal injuries caused by defendants' negligence in failing to properly diagnose and treat the condition from which plaintiff was suffering; the fourth \\"cause of action\\" merely adds a claim for punitive damages on allegations that defendants' conduct in this respect was wilful and wanton.

Section 11161.5 deals specifically with child abuse, and declares in pertinent part that in any case in which a minor is under a physician's care or is brought to him for diagnosis, examination or treatment, and \\"it appears to the physician\\" from observation of the minor that the latter has any physical injuries \\"which appear to have been inflicted upon him by other than accidental means by any person,\\" he must report that fact by telephone and in writing to the local law enforcement authorities and the juvenile probation department. All three sections require the report to state the name of the victim, if known, together with his whereabouts and the character and extent of his injuries; and a violation of any of the sections is a misdemeanor.¬ß 11162 Among such laws, of course, are the statutes penalizing child abuse.Pen. Code, ¬ß 273a, 273d. The statute imposes the same duty on certain other health care professionals, school officials and teachers, child care supervisors, and social workers. By means of allegations phrased largely in the statutory language plaintiff undertakes to charge defendants with a duty to comply with section 11161.5 (second \\"cause of action\\") and sections 11160 and 11161 (third \\"cause of action\\"), and avers that they failed to make the reports thus required by law. Her allegations of proximate cause and damages on these counts are essentially identical to those of the first count. X-ray image of a depressed skull fracture in an infant. This injury is typical of child abuse cases. We have found no case directly in point, but the issues may be decided by reference to well settled principles. Succinctly stated, the rules governing our consideration of this appeal are \\"that a general demurrer admits the truth of all material factual allegations in the complaint; that the question of plaintiff's ability to prove these allegations, or the possible difficulty in making such proof does not concern the reviewing court; and that plaintiff need only plead facts showing that he may be. The standard of care in malpractice cases is also well known. With unimportant variations in phrasing, we have consistently held that a physician is required to possess and exercise, in both diagnosis and treatment. The first question presented, accordingly, is whether the foregoing standard of care includes a requirement that the physician know how to diagnose and treat the battered child syndrome. It appears from the literature that the battered child syndrome was first tentatively identified and reported to the medical profession in the early 1950s. Further surveys and analyses of the syndrome followed, culminating in a landmark article published in 1962 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.Kempe et al., The Battered-Child Syndrome (1962) 181 A.M.A.J. 17 Since that date numerous additional studies of the condition have been undertaken, and their results and recommendations publicized in the medical journals. A typical article in the field recites case histories of child abuse, points out the distinguishing signs and symptoms of the battered child syndrome, and advises the practicing physician how to detect and treat the condition. For a detailed survey of the medical literature on the topic from its beginning until 1965,McCoid, The Battered Child and Other Assaults Upon the Family: Part One (1965) 50 Minn.L.Rev. 1, 3-19 A selection of the later articles is cited in Grumet, The Plaintive Plaintiffs: Victims of the Battered Child Syndrome (1970) 4 Family L.Q. 296 While helpful, the foregoing general history of the battered child syndrome is not conclusive on the precise question in the case at bar. The question is whether a reasonably prudent physician examining this plaintiff in 1971 would have been led to suspect she was a victim of the battered child syndrome from the particular injuries and circumstances presented to him, would have confirmed that diagnosis by ordering X-rays of her entire skeleton, and would have promptly reported his findings to appropriate authorities to prevent a recurrence of the injuries. There are numerous recommendations to follow each of these diagnostic and treatment procedures in the medical literature cited above. For example, the leading article by Kempe et al., op. cit., supra,181 A.M.A.J. 17 states that \\"A physician needs to have a high initial level of suspicion of the diagnosis of the battered-child syndrome in instances of subdural hematoma, multiple unexplained fractures at different stages of healing, failure to thrive, when soft tissue swelling or skin bruising are present, or in any other situation where the degree and type of injury is at variance with the history given regarding its occurrence . . . .\\" (Id., at p. 20.) Of the different types of fractures exhibited, an arm or leg fracture caused by a twisting force is particularly significant because \\"The extremities are the 'handles' for rough handling\\" of the child by adults. (Id., at p. 22.) The article also contains numerous recommendations to conduct a \\"radiologic examination of the entire skeleton\\" for the purpose of confirming the diagnosis, explaining that \\"To the informed physician, the bones tell a story the child is too young or too frightened to tell.\\" (Id., at p. 18.) Finally, on the subject of management of the case it is repeatedly emphasized that the physician \\"should report possible willful trauma to the police department or any special children's protective service that operates in his community\\" (id., at p. 23) in order to forestall further injury to the child: \\"All too often, despite the apparent cooperativeness of the parents and their apparent desire to have the child with them, the child returns to his home only to be assaulted again and suffer permanent brain damage or death.\\" (Id., at p. 24.) Inasmuch as the \\"common knowledge\\" exception to the foregoing rule does not apply on the facts here alleged, the trial court could not properly conclude as a matter of law that defendants' standard of professional care did not include the diagnostic and treatment procedures outlined in the complaint. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to the opportunity to prove by way of expert testimony that in the circumstances of this case a reasonably prudent physician would have followed those procedures. Whether the physician would have followed the procedure of reporting plaintiff's injuries to the authorities, however, is not solely a question of good medical practice. The above-cited reporting statutes (Pen. Code, ¬ß 11160- 11161.5) were in force in 1971. They evidence a determination by the Legislature that in the event a physician does diagnose a battered child syndrome, due care includes a duty to report that fact to the authorities. In other words, since the enactment of these statutes a physician who diagnoses a battered child syndrome will not be heard to say that other members of his profession would not have made such a report. The same is true of each of the persons and entities covered by this legislation. Accordingly, although expert testimony on the issue of a duty to report is admissible, it is not mandatory. The statute also lays to rest defendant Flood's concern that if he were required to report his findings to the authorities he might be held liable for violation of the physician-patient privilege.Evid. Code, ¬ß 992. Section 11161.5 specifically exempts the physician from any civil or criminal liability for making a report pursuant to its terms. Multiple rib fractures in an infant. Red are old and healed. Green are newer. Defendants complain that the first \\"cause of action\\" is nevertheless fatally defective because it assertedly fails to allege certain specific facts, i.e., that Dr. Flood negligently treated plaintiff's leg fracture, that proper treatment of that fracture or the bruises on plaintiff's back included taking an X-ray of her skull, and that Dr. Flood negligently failed to ask plaintiff's mother for an explanation of the cause of the fracture. None of these allegations is necessary, however, because they are irrelevant to the gist of the complaint. Plaintiff's theory is that in the circumstances of this case the fracture, the bruises, and the lack of an explanation offered by her mother are themselves indicia of the underlying battered child syndrome of which plaintiff was the victim, and it was that condition which defendants negligently failed to diagnose and treat. For the reasons stated, the complaint adequately alleges the facts necessary to support such a theory. A third person may act in a particular manner is the hazard or one of the hazards which makes the actor negligent, such an act whether innocent, negligent, intentionally tortious, or criminal does not prevent the actor from being liable for harm caused thereby.\\" See Vesely v. Sager, supra, at p. 164 of 5 Cal.3d, and cases cited. As we recently observed with respect to a determination of duty, however, \\"foreseeability is a question of fact for the jury.\\" Weirum v. RKO General, Inc. (1975) 15 Cal.3d 40, 46 [123 Cal.Rptr. 468, 539 P.2d 36] The same rule applies when the issue is whether the intervening act of a third person was foreseeable and therefore did not constitute a superseding cause: in such circumstances \\"The foreseeability of the risk generally frames a question for the trier of fact\\" Weaver v. Bank of America (1963) 59 Cal.2d 428, 434 [30 Cal.Rptr. 4, 380 P.2d 644]; accord, Rest.2d Torts, ¬ß 453, com. b) Restatement the fact that the risk eventuates does not relieve him of responsibility.See, e.g., Kempe et al., The Battered-Child Syndrome (1962) 181 A.M.A.J. 17, 24, quoted in footnote 7, ante;Boardman, A Project to Rescue Children from Inflicted Injuries (1962) 7 Soc. Work 43, 49 (\\"Experiences with the repetitive nature of injuries indicate that an adult who has once injured a child is likely to repeat. . . . [The] child must be considered to be in grave danger unless his environment can be proved to be safe\\")Fontana et al., The \\"Maltreatment Syndrome\\" in Children (1963) 269 New England J. Med. 1389, 1393 (\\"over 50 per cent of these children are liable to secondary injuries or death if appropriate steps are not taken to remove them from their environment\\")Friedman, The Need for Intensive Follow-Up of Abused Children, in Helping the Battered Child and his Family (Kempe & Helfer eds. 1972) chapter 6, page 79 (\\"it would appear from our investigations that the severe permanent damage associated with the 'battered child syndrome' usually does not occur with the initial incident. Identification of abuse at this time thus offers an opportunity for intervention with the goal of preventing subsequent trauma and irreversible injury to the child\\"). Accordingly, the trial court in the case at bar could not properly rule as a matter of law that the defendants' negligence was not the proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries. Plaintiff is entitled to prove by expert testimony that defendants should reasonably have foreseen that her caretakers were likely to resume their physical abuse and inflict further injuries on her if she were returned directly to their custody. Again defendant Flood presses only a technical point of pleading, claiming the allegation of proximate cause is fatally defective because the foreseeability of the intervening conduct of plaintiff's mother and Reyes is not specifically set forth. It is asserted that under the case law such an allegation is mandatory if the foreseeability of the intervening act does not clearly appear from the pleaded facts of negligence and injury.(See, e.g., France v. Long Beach etc. Sch. Dist. (1943) 58 Cal.App.2d 566 [137 P.2d 60].) As shown above, however, here the occurrence of the intervening act is the precise hazard to which defendants' conduct is alleged to have negligently exposed plaintiff, and the injuries pleaded are those which a reasonably prudent physician would have foreseen as likely to ensue from that negligence. In these circumstances \\"The allegations of the complaint are sufficient to present the issue\\" of proximate cause.Custodio v. Bauer (1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 303, 316-317 [59 Cal.Rptr. 463, 27 A.L.R.3d 884]. Pursuant to our duty to liberally construe pleadings with a view to achieving substantial justice (Code Civ. Proc., ¬ß 452) we therefore treat the second and third \\"causes of action\\" as alternative counts setting forth plaintiff's theory of statutory liability. The purpose of that theory is manifestly to raise a presumption that by omitting to report plaintiff's injuries to the authorities as required by law, defendants failed to exercise due care‚Äîa presumption now codified in Evidence Code section 669. Defendant Flood correctly concedes that the complaint alleges facts showing compliance with the first, third and fourth of the conditions specified of rebutting that presumption. Insofar as relevant here, section 669 provides: \\"(a) The failure of a person to exercise due care is presumed if: \\"(1) He violated a statute, ordinance, or regulation of a public entity; \\"(2) The violation proximately caused death or injury to person or property; \\"(3) The death or injury resulted from an occurrence of the nature which the statute, ordinance, or regulation was designed to prevent; and \\"(4) The person suffering the death or the injury to his person or property was one of the class of persons for whose protection the statute, ordinance, or regulation was adopted. \\"(b) This presumption may be rebutted by proof that: \\"(1) The person violating the statute, ordinance, or regulation did what might reasonably be expected of a person of ordinary prudence, acting under similar circumstances, who desired to comply with the law; . . .\\" A number of recent commentators support this theory of liability.See, e.g., Isaacson, Child Abuse Reporting Statutes: The Case for Holding Physicians Civilly Liable for Failing to Report (1975) 12 San Diego L.Rev. 743, 756-762Ramsey & Lawler, The Battered Child Syndrome (1974) 1 Pepperdine L.Rev. 372Fraser, A Pragmatic Alternative to Current Legislative Approaches to Child Abuse (1974) 12 Am.Crim.L.Rev. 103, 115 & fn. 51Paulsen, Child Abuse Reporting Laws: The Shape of the Legislation (1967) 67 Colum.L.Rev. 1, 34-36for a published recommendation to the same effect by one of plaintiff's counsel in the case at bar, see Kohlman, Malpractice Liability for Failing to Report Child Abuse (1974) 49 State Bar J. 118. Finally, defendants raise two questions of statutory interpretation. They contend that even if plaintiff may rely on Penal Code section 11161.5 in this case, she cannot invoke sections 11160 and 11161 because the latter are \\"general\\" statutes which have assertedly been superseded by the former as a \\"special\\" statute on the same topic. But such supersession occurs only when the provisions are \\"inconsistent\\" Code Civ. Proc., ¬ß 1859 which is not here the case. Sections 11160 and 11161.5 are directed to different classes of persons, and hence are not inconsistent but complementary. Sections 11161 and 11161.5, on the other hand, are duplicative of each other to the extent that the former deals with physical injuries unlawfully inflicted on minors and the latter deals with the observation of such injuries by a physician.See generally Note, The California Legislative Approach to Problems of Willful Child Abuse (1966) 54 Cal.L.Rev. 1805, 1814-1815 But inasmuch as the same penalty is provided for a violation of each section Pen. Code, ¬ß 11162 they do not present an irreconcilable conflict requiring one to give way to the other.Compare People v. Gilbert (1969) and cases cited. There is nothing to prevent the Legislature from imposing a reporting requirement on physicians in two separate statutes, even if their coverage apparently overlaps. Defendants next contend that plaintiff can rely on section 11161.5 only if she can prove that Dr. Flood in fact observed her various injuries and in fact formed the opinion they were caused by other than accidental means and by another person‚Äîin other words, that his failure to comply with the reporting requirement of the statute was intentional rather than negligent. We first note that the complaint in effect so alleges, thereby mooting the issue at this pleading stage. For the guidance of the court at the trial, however, we briefly address the point of proof. The provision of section 11161.5 is ambiguous with respect to the required state of mind of the physician. It has been suggested that for the purposes of a criminal prosecution \\"the more reasonable interpretation of the statutory language is that no physician can be convicted unless it is shown that it actually appeared to him that the injuries were inflicted injuries and formed the opinion they were intentionally inflicted on her. By parity of reasoning, the same rule will apply if plaintiff elects to rely at trial on sections 11160 and 11161 as well. This does not mean, of course, that plaintiff can meet her burden only by extracting damaging admissions from defendant Flood. \\"The knowledge a person may have when material to an issue in a judicial proceeding is a fact to be proven as any other fact. It differs from physical objects and phenomena in that it is a state of mind like belief or consciousness and cannot be seen, heard or otherwise directly observed by other persons. It may be evidenced by the affirmative statement or admission of the possessor of it. If he is silent or says he did not have such knowledge, it may be evidenced in other ways,\\" i.e., by circumstantial evidence and the inferences which the trier of fact may draw therefrom.Oil Workers Intl. Union v. Superior Court (1951) 103 Cal.App.2d 512, 532-533 [230 P.2d 71] Plaintiff will therefore be entitled to introduce proof of facts alleged in her complaint as circumstantial evidence that defendant Flood possessed the requisite state of mind, and any conflict between such evidence and direct testimony of defendant Flood will be for the trier of fact to resolve. The judgment is reversed. Judges Wright, C. J., McComb, J., Tobriner, J., Sullivan, J., Clark, J., and Richardson, J., concurred. Discussion A diagnosis of battered child syndrome essentially means that serious injuries inflicted on a child were done by another person, by other than accidental means, and it had become an accepted medical diagnosis by the early 1970s.2 Am Jur Proof of Facts 2d 365, \\"Child Abuse - The Battered Child Syndrome.\\"97 ALR 3d 338 Many states have enacted penal statutes prohibiting child abuse, and many have enacted statutes of a general nature, or specifically applicable to cases of child abuse, imposing reporting requirements on physicians, and others in a professional position to recognize abuse.2 Am Jur Proof of Facts 2d 365, section 27 Fractured ribs in various stages of healing, typically seen from squeezing injury. Red shows old healed fractures. Green is newer fracture. The decision in Landeros v. Flood was the first time that a cause of action was established to exist in favor of a battered child against a physician who negligently failed to diagnose the battered child syndrome or to comply with an applicable reporting statute. Such failure was found to be the cause of further similar injury to the child. The causal chain was not broken by the fact that the subsequent injury was inflicted by the same third persons, namely the child's mother and her common- law husband who were responsible for the original injuries.97 ALR 3d 339 The court held that no physician could be convicted for failure to make the necessary reports to the civil authorities as required by California statute, unless it was shown that it actually appeared to him that the injuries were inflicted on the child, so that his failure to report was intentional and not merely negligent. If the child wished to satisfy the requirements of the statute, it would be necessary to persuade the trier of fact that the physician actually observed her injuries and formed the requisite opinion that they were intentionally inflicted on her. The court also held that even if the trial court found the child experienced further beatings at the hands of her mother and the latter's husband, it constituted an \\"intervening act\\" and not a \\"superseding cause\\", thereby relieving the defendants of liability. This was predicated on the finding (at the trial court level) that the foreseeability arose directly from the risk created by the original negligence. This would be the risk created by the original failure of the physician to diagnose and report the injuries. This was a question of fact for the jury, and could not be dismissed by the trial court as a matter of law.97 ALR 3d 339-340 Child abuse, or battered child syndrome was first reported in the medical literature in 1946 by Caffey.Caffey, 56 Am J Roentgen 163, 1946 By the 1960s, the medical literature was rife with reports and discussions of both the syndrome, and the need for health care professionals to report it when diagnosed or suspected.Adelson, 264 New England J Med 1345, 1961Bain, 31 Pediatrics 895, 1963Bakwin 49 J Pediat. 7, 1956Barmeyer, Alderson and Cox, 38 J.

It is generally recognized that the physician is the primary means of identifying the abused child.Kempe et al ibid. Despite existing legislation requiring, as a matter of law, the reporting of suspicious cases, many physicians remained reluctant to report cases to civil authorities.Paulsen 67 Colum L Rev 38Note, 18 U Fla L Rev 507Note, 7 Colum J L & Soc Prob 55 Physicians reluctance to report has been traced to these factors :2 Proof of Facts 2d, section 6, pp. 393 et seq #The lack of standard definition, especially in the reporting statutes, as to what constitutes child abuse. #Uncertainty that the diagnosis of \\"battered child syndrome\\" is correct or appropriate in individual cases. #Reluctance to breach doctor‚Äìpatient confidentiality. #Fear that reporting will cause parents not to bring injured children for medical attention. #Fear of criminal or civil penalties for incorrect diagnoses. #General eschewing of legal and social welfare agencies. #Lack of knowledge of procedures involved with reporting. Landeros v. Flood was a landmark case in which tort law was used to purposely change the behavior of physicians and encourage them to report suspected child abuse. Otherwise, they would face the threat of civil action for damages in tort proximately flowing from the failure to report the suspected injuries.

After Finland's declaration of independence the parish became an issue in Finnish-Russian relations when its population held a vote in August 1918 to join Finland. The Finnish Army moved to occupy Poraj√§rvi in October. In the 1920 Treaty of Tartu, Finland gave up its claims on Poraj√§rvi and the neighboring Repola, and instead received Petsamo in the far north. The inhabitants of Poraj√§rvi, however, did not give up, and in 1921 they started a rebellion against the Bolsheviks.

History Foundation In 1919 was found Societ√† Sportiva Portocivitanova (in some years will change names to become simply Civitanovese) thanks to the willingness of some citizens, including Gerardo Bella who would later be the first president. The boot is not the most simple: the club doesn't participate consistently in championships- it only plays friendly matches. In 1938 the Fascist regime unified the upper part with the port area, creating the comune of Civitanova Marche. To accommodate the change, they decided to form a team that could adequately represent the new reality. Thanks to the entrepreneur Adriano Cecchetti, the club began playing in minor leagues. In the 1942‚Äì1943 season the club was able to play in Serie C, and the first derby against Maceratese was lost by 1‚Äì2. Postwar period After the war Civitanovese played two consecutive seasons in Serie C (1946‚Äì47 and 1947‚Äì48), from then only on years in Regional Promotion where in some seasons indicate fiery derby against Del Duca Ascoli, the Fermo, the Sauro Vis Pesaro and Macerata. Golden years Until the early 80s the team always plays between Serie D and Promozione, with only two seasons in Serie C (1961‚Äì62 and '62‚Äì'63). In fact in the late '70s was promoted to the newly established Serie C2 and in the 1980‚Äì1981 season comes second, behind Padova and in front of Maceratese, and as a result it was promoted to Serie C1 Group B. The year is remembered with great enthusiasm in the city because after twenty years, the team returned to play against bigger clubs: Ternana, Salerno, Taranto, Livorno and others. The 27 points earned are not enough and relegation is inevitable. The following year in Serie C2 is still second, behind the Francavilla, and promoted to Serie C1 where, however, relegated again. These years are also to be remembered for the many friendly and large companies decided to play at the Sports Centre of Civitanova; the most remembered was against Milan. With the leadership headed by Costamagna remains in Serie C2 until the early '90s. In 1993‚Äì94 rossoblu relegated from Serie C2 Group B after earning just 26 points. The new millennium The second half of the 90s are characterized by ups and downs between Serie D, Eccellenza and some years in Promozione. With the arrival of the new millennium back from Eccellenza Civitanovese unfortunately wasn't able to give great satisfaction to its audience. (2004‚Äì2005, 2006‚Äì2007, 2007‚Äì2008). Fans at the end of the season '07‚Äì'08 asked clearly to society and made it clear that they wanted to see his team get back to playing in the categories best fit to the square. In the 2008‚Äì2009 season the club has participated Eccellenza Marche. Started badly, in November the Civitanovese hired Osvaldo Jaconi on the bench and with a great second round wins 2nd place and brings the club to the playoffs. The team even comes to the national play-off final against Selargius, but it lost 0‚Äì2 in Sardinia and wasn't successful in the second leg. But, the team would be allowed to play in Serie D due to fill vacancies created. The three successive seasons are very good with the club that beating many teams and reaching the play-off but didn't achieve the promotion. The 2012‚Äì2013 season featured the return of the \\"derby\\" with Maceratese. Civitanovese played two more seasons in Serie D until it was declared bankrupt by a Macerata court at the end of June 2015, thus it eventually folded. Another refoundation A new club US Civitanovese SSD was founded in June 2015 and entered Eccellenza Marche by acquiring the former club's sporting title.

In a later interview with a local journalist at the age of 15, Cartrain stated that the choice of his pseudonym was chosen at random, early on as he developed his style, and that despite early difficulties, he quickly began taking his work more seriously. The interview continues, quoting Cartrain: > I only did small pen tags. I started off doing small stencils of text, but I > got hold of a copy of [some] computer graphics software, Photoshop, and my > stencils have improved. It's very hard cutting out large stencils, as it > takes a lot of time, and hurts your wrist.

He served as the bishop of the Diocese of Savannah, Georgia (1967‚Äì1972) and the Diocese of Lafayette, Louisiana (1972‚Äì1989). Biography Early life and education One of nine children, Gerard Frey was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Andrew Francis and Marie Theresa (n√©e DeRose) Frey. Two of his brothers also entered the priesthood. After attending St. Vincent de Paul School, he studied at St. Joseph College Seminary from 1928 to 1932. He then entered Notre Dame Seminary, where he completed his theological studies. Ordination and ministry Frey was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of New Orleans on April 2, 1938. He then served as a curate at Holy Rosary Church in Taft until 1946, when he became director of the Archdiocesan Confraternity of Christian Doctrine. While serving as director, he resided at St. Leo the Great Church in New Orleans. He was named a Papal Chamberlain by Pope Pius XII in 1949, and pastor of St. Frances Cabrini Church at New Orleans in 1952. Domestic Prelate 1954. He attended the Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965 as a pastoral representative. He was later made pastor of St. Francis de Sales Church in Houma. Bishop of Savannah On May 31, 1967, Frey was appointed the eleventh Bishop of Savannah, Georgia, by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following August 8 from Archbishop Philip Hannan, with Bishops Charles Pasquale Greco and Robert Emmet Tracy serving as co-consecrators. He selected as his episcopal motto: Serviam (Latin: \\"I will serve\\"). During his tenure, he launched the Social Apostolate, a social service agency designed \\"to put people in the pews in touch with the poor.\\" He also encouraged every church in the diocese to establish a parish council. Bishop of Lafayette On November 7, 1972, Frey was appointed the third Bishop of Lafayette, in his native Louisiana. During his tenure, he initiated reorganization plans that increased and expanded participation by clergy, religious, and laity in diocesan affairs. He also named the first woman to serve as chancellor of a Catholic diocese in the United States. In 1987 he opened a diocesan synod. Frey was the Bishop of Lafayette when the Archdiocese and the Catholic Church faced the first wave of civil suits seeking compensation and treatment for abused children. In a legal deposition, Frey admitted to confronting Father Gilbert Gauthe in 1974. Gauthe was a Catholic priest who later confessed to sexually abusing 37 children entrusted to his care, though he pleaded not guilty to criminal charges by reason of insanity. According to Frey, Gauthe admitted at the time that he was guilty of \\"imprudent touches\\" with a boy and promised that it was an isolated instance that would not recur. The following year, 1975, Frey appointed Father Gauthe as chaplain of the diocesan Boy Scouts. Gauthe was ultimately convicted in the first sex-abuse case against the Catholic Church. He registered as a sex-offender and, as of 2013, resides in Texas. Retirement and death Upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75, Frey resigned as Bishop of Lafayette on May 13, 1989. He was succeeded by his coadjutor bishop, Harry Flynn (who would later become Archbishop of St. Paul and Minneapolis). Frey retired to a family compound in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, which was heavily damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. His brother Jerome drove to Bay St. Louis to rescue him, returning him to Louisiana. Frey spent the remainder of his life first at Consolata Nursing Home in New Iberia and later in a private home in Lafayette provided by the diocese. He died after a lengthy illness at age 93. He is buried in the crypt of the Cathedral of Saint John the Evangelist.

It operated exactly for one century, from 1824 to 1924. It was founded by Bishop Nerses V Ashtaraketsi, Armenian primate of the diocese of Georgia (later Catholicos of All Armenians Nerses V), after whom it was named.  History  In the 19th century Tiflis (Tbilisi) was a major Armenian cultural center with a large Armenian population. Numerous Armenian schools, various publications, drama associations and societies, charities and nonprofit organizations functioned in the city. The Nersisian School officially opened in 1824 and throughout its existence it had a unique role in Eastern Armenian education. In 1905, the school was destroyed in a bombing. Afterward, Alexander Mantashev solved all the school's financial problems with the designing and building of the school by a Russian-Armenian military architect Nikita Lazarev. The fa√ßade of the building was built of an orange stone from the Tsater (Lori) and Karahunj (Zangezur) villages. Alexander Mantashev spent 370,000 rubles (444 kg/gold) during the construction of the new building. In front of the school stood statues of Nerses Ashtaraketsi and Alexander Mantashev.

The idea to publish it had already been proposed by Iztok Juranƒçiƒç before 1991, when Slovenia declared its independence. However, it was realized only in 1992. At first, the newspaper was published by the company Gospodarski Vestnik. Today, it is published by the ƒåasnik Finance company, which is owned by the Swedish Bonnier Group and also publishes several other publications; for example, the magazines Manager and Moje finance, the healthcare newspaper Medicina danes, and the web portals Finance and Mojevro. As of 2008, the Finance Business Daily accounted for three quarter of the ƒåasnik Finance company income. Before becoming a daily newspaper in 2002, Finance was issued twice weekly. History The first issue of Finance was published on 20 May 1992. It is based in Ljubljana. The paper was initially a biweekly. In 1993, it had over 2,000 subscribers. In 1994, Gospodarski Vestnik appointed Peter Frankl as its director. In 1999, the company ƒåasnik Finance was established. It was owned by Gospodarski Vestnik (50%), Dagens Industrie (45%), and several individuals (5%). The director of the company was Jurij Giacomelli. The internet version of the newspaper began in October 2000. In 2002, Finance became a daily, and the visual design changed as well. In 2005, the owner of the company ƒåasnik Finance (99.59%) became Bonnier Business Press AB, previously called Dagens Industrie. In 2006 the owner appointed Peter Frankl as the director of ƒåasnik Finance. He also remained the editor-at-large. In 2003, Finance had a circulation of 10,000 copies.

As the name implies, they were shown only as Saturday and Sunday matinees, usually just before the showing of the main feature which happened to be playing at the theatre at that time. The films ranged from old favorites such as The Wizard of Oz (1939), Lassie Come Home (1943), and The Secret Garden (1949), to later widescreen films such as the 1960 remake of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, to then-recent fare such as Clarence, the Cross-Eyed Lion. All the trailers for the films in the series were newly created, using footage from the original trailers of the films, and combining them with new narration. For example, the narration for the series trailer for Forbidden Planet targeted the boys in the audience and focused solely on the science fiction elements, and \\"Robby the Robot\\", and none of the romance between Leslie Nielsen and Anne Francis.

History Hensall can trace its roots back at least as far as the 1086 Domesday Book, in which it is listed as Edeshale. The name of Edeshale is said to derive from Aedan's, or Edan's, Nook of land. The largest building in the village is the Anglican St. Paul's Church, which was commissioned by the Viscount Downe in 1843, and is now grade II* listed. The building is almost identical to the Holy Trinity Church, located in East Cowick, just over five miles east of the village. St. Paul's Church was consecrated in 1854. For most of its history the people of Hensall were employed in agricultural industries, with some cottage industries also present. Today the village is largely a dormitory settlement, with inhabitants commuting to nearby towns and cities for work; however, there are a number of light industries based in Hensall. Geography Location The village of Hensall is located just south of the River Aire, and lies in an area known as the Humberhead Levels. The Levels cover a large area, and are characterised by flat, low-lying land, formed at the end on the Ice Age. Due to its proximity to a river, and the flat land it occupies, Hensall has long been suited to arable farming. Having once been home to several farms only a few remain in the village today, and though some livestock is kept, crops are the main agricultural output. Hensall lies on rich sand deposits, which have in the past been quarried. As a result of the quarrying a number of former quarries puncture the otherwise flat landscape. In recent years these have become important habitats for wildlife, and are home to species such as sand martins, buzzards and marsh orchids. During the Autumn 2000 UK Floods the village was affected by flooding from the River Aire, though was spared the worst of the flooding that affected the neighbouring village of Gowdall, two miles away. Following the flooding in 2000 flood defenses in the area were dramatically improved, and defended the village when they were put to their first major test, during flooding over the winter of 2015. Layout Hensall is a detached village, meaning that as well as the principal settlement there are a number of separate areas to the community. The core of the village is built around Main Street, while three outlying parts of Hensall are separated from the centre by farmland. As the name suggests, Main Street is the principle thoroughfare of Hensall. With Field Lane and Finkle Street, Main Street forms a loop that makes up the village core. The area contains a number of the village's amenities including the Post Office (which also acts as the village store), the Methodist Church and the local Italian restaurant; La Anchor. Several other residential streets are connected to this part of the village. One of these streets, Bird Lane, leads to a sports field, home of Hensall's cricket and football clubs. Adjacent to the cricket pavilion is one of the village's two playgrounds. Station Road acts as a corridor connecting the heart of the village to Weeland Road. Weeland Road is the main road in and out of the village. A number of homes can be found along Station Road, as well as Hensall Station, and the village pub; the Railway Tavern. Station Road is also home to the village's other playground. Where Station Road meets Weeland Road there is a crossroads, from which Church Lane emerges on the other side. Church Lane connects Hensall to the neighbouring village of Great Heck, which is a mile to the south. Church Lane is home to its namesake, St. Paul's Church, and the village school. Main Street becomes Wand Lane as it exits the core part of Hensall to the north-west. About a quarter of a mile along the route is Dene Close, a collection of post-war homes, built in the 1950s. Half a mile west along Weeland Road from the Station Road crossroads is a small collection of homes in an area known as Eggborough Ings. The homes in this area connect with Wand Lane to the north, and the core part of the village, via Hazel Old Lane. Governance Hensall is located in the historic county of Yorkshire, within the West Riding. From 1938 to 1974 the village was part of the Osgoldcross Rural District. Following the Local Government Act of 1972 Hensall became part of the ceremonial, and non-metropolitan, county of North Yorkshire. The same act saw local administration transferred to the District of Selby. At district level Hensall is in the ward of Camblesforth & Carlton. At county level the village is in the Osgoldcross division. Hensall is in the UK parliamentary seat of Selby & Ainsty. The village is represented at the European level by the Yorkshire and the Humber constituency. North Yorkshire Police serve the village from their local base in Selby. Transport By road Hensall lies on the A645, which is known as Weeland Road in the village. The A645 connects with the A19 a mile west of Hensall, providing connections to Selby and York to the north, and Doncaster to the south. The A19 connects with Junction 34 of the M62 just south-west of the village, providing good connections to Goole and Kingston upon Hull to the east, and Leeds, Pontefract and Wakefield to the west. By rail Hensall is located on the Pontefract Line of the West Yorkshire Metro. From Monday to Saturday the village is served by three trains a day, with one train terminating in Goole, and two trains terminating in Leeds. The East Coast Main Line (that connects Edinburgh to London) passes Hensall just a quarter of a mile east of the village, though the nearest stations to Hensall on that line are at Doncaster, which is sixteen miles south of the village, and York, twenty one miles to the north. By bus Hensall has a limited service, operated by Arriva Yorkshire. There are a number of bus stops placed in the village along a route that goes from Selby to Wakefield, and back, between Monday and Saturday. Amenities For a village of its size Hensall is served by a relatively good number of community amenities and services. Hensall Community Primary School takes children from the age of four to eleven. The Snaith School offers secondary education to children aged eleven to sixteen, and is located just four miles away. The Snaith School is connected to the village by a purpose run bus. There are two children's playgrounds in the village. La Anchor, an Italian restaurant, popular with both villagers and people from further afield, can be found on Main Street. There is also a village pub; the Railway Tavern. Hensall is also served by a post office, which doubles as the village store. The flat landscape and numerous country lanes around Hensall lend themselves to cycling, there are also a number of public footpaths around the village. Hensall is home to both a cricket club and a football club. The Anglican St. Paul's Church, and a Methodist church, can both be found in the village. Notable people * Anne Greaves (1889‚Äìc.1948), was the first woman to become a member of the Institute of Quarrying and created artificial stone through her quarrying company Hensall on screen On 20 January 2015 Hensall was featured on the popular BBC television show Great British Railway Journeys. The programme is presented by former MP Michael Portillo. During the episode \\"Boston to Hensall\\", during the sixth season of the show, Portillo boarded a Goole bound train at Knottingley Station and travelled on one of the least used passenger railway routes in the country, a so-called \\"Parliamentary Train\\". While he was in Hensall Portillo took a ride through the village on a road going steam engine. In late 2018 filming took place on the outskirts of the village for the Universal Pictures film Fast & Furious Presents Hobbs & Shaw. Eggborough Power Station, the location of the shoot, and which borders the village, was able to be used as a location, having been decommissioned earlier that year. During the 2019 UCI Road World Championships Hensall was one of the host towns and villages along two of the races. The two races to visit Hensall were staged on Friday 27 September 2019, and included the junior women's race and the under 23 men's race. The junior women's race was won by American cyclist Megan Jastrab. The men's under-23 race was won by the Italian Samuele Battistella, while Tom Pidcock, who is from Yorkshire, took the bronze. Both of these races took place on a course that began in Doncaster and finished in Harrogate, and both races were broadcast live on BBC Sport. Hensall, Canada In 1851 two Hensall villagers, the brothers George and James Petty, founded the community of Hensall in the Canadian province of Ontario. The settlement is located in Huron County, and is roughly nine miles east Lake Huron, one of the Great Lakes.

The addition of the word \\"Wet\\" made the film sound more like a typical Roman Porno sex film than one that dealt with serious social issues. The media controversy over the film, as well as a condemnation from a Minister of Internal Affairs only served as free publicity for the film, and it became an immediate box-office hit.Weisser, pp. 348-349. The film's influence went beyond the pink film genre. Many Japanese critics claim the film noir-style anti-hero in Japanese cinema‚Äîrepresented in films ranging from Kinji Fukasaku's Graveyard of Honor (1975) to the films of Takeshi Kitano‚Äîhad its origins in Retreat Through the Wet Wasteland. Director Yukihiro Sawada was known for his efforts in attempting to elevate Nikkatsu's Roman Porno films above their pink film origins, such as in his previous Sex Hunter: Wet Target (1972) and later Assault! (1976).Weisser, p. 348. He was particularly known for bringing social issues to the pink film, such as violence, racial prejudice and police corruption. Later in his career he brought the thriller genre into his Roman Pornos.Weisser, p. 325. Screenwriter Kazuhiko Hasegawa went on to direct the acclaimed The Man who Stole the Sun (1979). Lead actress Yuri Yamashina had been an actress in the pink film genre before the inception of Nikkatsu's Roman Porno series in 1971. Acting under the name Saeko Tsugawa, she was associated with director Kan Mukai's studio, appearing for the director in such films as Cruel Story of a Sex Film Actress (1968). Yamashina had been featured in a few previous Roman Porno films, but her first starring film for Nikkatsu was Retreat Through the Wet Wasteland.Weisser, p. 38-39, 96. Availability Retreat Through the Wet Wasteland was released theatrically in Japan on June 23, 1973. It was released on DVD in Japan on March 24, 2006, as part of Geneon's third wave of Nikkatsu Roman porno series.

He was the brother of John Ryan, the British animator and cartoonist.  Life  Patrick Ryan was born in Hampstead in 1916, the second son of Sir Andrew Ryan, a British diplomat who was the last dragoman in Constantinople, and his wife Ruth. Patrick was educated at Ampleforth in North Yorkshire. In 1935 he entered the Dominican Order at Woodchester Priory in Gloucestershire where he was given the name Columba. At the age of 30 (in 1946) he completed his DPhil at Oxford University. He was one of the friars who was on the Peace Pilgrimage to V√©zelay in Burgundy, selecting \\"30 strong men\\" to carry a heavy wooden cross across France in thanksgiving for the end of the Second World War. Ryan had an analytical mind and enjoyed philosophical controversy and debate. While teaching philosophy at the Dominican House of Studies at Hawkesyard in 1954, he set up a Philosophical Enquiry Group, an annual meeting for Catholic philosophers held at the nearby Spode House. The Catholic philosophers Elizabeth Anscombe and Peter Geach were among the first invited, remaining leading figures of the group for the 20 years. He was also bursar at the priory. He was briefly in charge of studies at Blackfriars, Oxford, where he was pro-regent of studies,Catholic Herald 2009 then became chaplain to the Catholic students at the University of Strathclyde. Ryan's contribution to philosophy and theology was more through his influence on the people he taught, although a short piece 'The Traditional Concept of Natural Law: an Interpretation' (which he claimed to have written on the train before he gave it as a lecture) has been influential.Catholic News 2009, see also Lisska p.80 His students included Herbert McCabe and Timothy McDermott, both translators of the Blackfriars Summa, and Fergus Kerr. He was an early pioneer of religious broadcasting, producing and narrating films about the religious life.Catholic Herald 2009 He died, aged 93, on what was then the Feast of St Dominic.

History to present Brashear was founded in 1868,Brashear News Archives and it was named for Joseph Brashear, who surveyed the townsite with settlement and foundation. The area was part of the Wise Ranch in 1898, when G. W. Mahoney bought the ranch, divided it into small farms, laid out the townsite, and donated land for a school, a church, and a cemetery. A post office was established at Brashear in 1899, with W. G. Crain as postmaster. A school opened the same year, and in 1905 it had an enrollment of 149. By 1914, the town had Baptist, Christian, and Methodist churches, a bank, a newspaper, a telegraph connection, and a reported population of 400. Its population was estimated at 300 in the mid-1920s and 350 in the late 1940s. In 1948 the town had six stores, four churches, a two-teacher school, and a cotton gin. The population declined during the 1960s to 280 and continued to be reported at that level in 1990 and 2000.

A., Kokalis-Burelle, N., Bausher, M. G., and Rosskopf, E. N. 2008. Vegetable grafting: History, use, and current technology status in North America. HortScience. Pages 1664-1669 Typically, stock or rootstock are selected for their ability to resist infection by certain soilborne pathogens or their ability to increase vigor and fruit yield. The scion of the grafted tomato represents the upper portion of the plant and is selected for its fruit quality characteristics. There are several methods for grafting tomatoes and they have certain advantages and disadvantages. Once the grafts are made, the plants are moved into a chamber or environment with high relative humidity (>90%) and low light levels to reduce water stress in the scion while the graft union forms.  History of vegetable grafting  Grafting of woody plants has been common for centuries, but herbaceous grafting has only become popular recently in agricultural systems. The cultivation of grafted vegetable plants began in Korea and Japan at the end of the 1920s when watermelon plants were grafted onto squash rootstock[1]. Since this time, this technique has spread throughout Asia and Europe. Currently, 81% of Korean and 54% of Japanese vegetable cultivation uses grafting.Rivero, R. M., J. M. Ruiz, et al. (2003). \\"Role of Grafting in Horticultural Plants Under Stress Conditions.\\" Food, Agriculture, & Environment 1(1): 70-74 The use of this cultural technique is mainly carried out for intensive cropping systems like greenhouse and tunnel production. This method is especially popular for vegetable production in the orient, and the number of vegetables in 1998 was estimated to be 540 million transplants in Korea and 750 million in Japan.Lee, J. M., H. J. Bang, et al. (1998). \\"Grafting of vegetables.\\" Journal of the Japanese Society for Horticultural Science 67(6): 1098-1104 This technique has moved to the Mediterranean region as well, where the use of grafting has been proposed as a major component of an integrated management strategy for managing soilborne disease and increasing crop productivity. Grafted tomato transplant production has increased in Spain from less than one million plants in 1999‚Äì2000 to over 45 million plants in 2003‚Äì2004. Grafted tomato is also cultivated in France and Italy, and over 20 million tomato plants were grafted in Morocco in 2004 as a way to reduce soilborne disease and increase crop production.Besri, M. (2005). Current Situation of Tomato Grafting as Alternative to Methyl Bromide for Tomato Production in the Mediterranean Region. 2005 Annual International Research Conference on Methyl Bromide Alternatives and Emissions Reductions San Diego, CA USA. Grafting can take place on a number of crops. However, because of the added expense, it is typically associated with melons, cucurbits, and members of the family Solanaceae such as eggplant and tomato. Tomato grafting became popular in the 1960s as a way to reduce certain diseases caused by soilborne plant pathogens such as Raletonia solanacearum [1]. Currently, however, grafting is used to offer not only protection from certain diseases, but also tolerance to abiotic stress like flooding, drought, and salinity [2].  Fruit yield  The first grafts in the early 20th century were made in order to diminish attacks by infectious organisms, such as Fusarium oxysporum on watermelons. [2] However, research has shown that this technique can be effective against a variety of fungal, bacterial, viral, and nematode diseases.King, S. R., Davis, A. R., Liu, W. G., and Levi, A. 2008. Grafting for disease resistance. HortScience. Pg 1673-1676 Furthermore, many researchers are looking to utilize specific rootstocks as an alternative to methyl bromide-a soil fumigant that has been widely used until recently.[4] Grafting has been highly effective at overcoming abiotic sources of stress, such as soil salinity, temperature extremes, and excessive soil moisture.[2] Grafting has also been utilized to reduce the effects of flooding in areas where a wet season may occur.Black, L.L., D.L. Wu, J.F. Wang, T. Kalb, D. Abbass, and J.H. Chen. 2003 Grafting tomatoes for production in the hot-wet season. Asian Vegetable Research & Development Center Grafting tomatoes with tolerant rootstocks has been highly effective at producing a saline-tolerant plants. Research indicates that several rootstocks prevent the translocation of sodium and chloride into the shoot.Fernandez-Garcia, N., V. Martinez, A. Cerda, and M. Carvajal. 2002. Water and nutrient uptake of grafted tomato plants grown under saline conditions. Journal of Plant Physiology 159 (8):899-905 Many of the most economically important vegetable crops like tomato, squash, cucumber, and watermelon are highly sensitive to thermal stress in the roots throughout vegetative development and reproduction. Whether using rootstock tolerant of hot or cold temperatures, the use of temperature tolerant rootstocks often leads to the extension of the growing season in either direction, resulting in better yield and economic stability through the year.[2] Although the vegetable grafting is typically associated with reduction of disease or abiotic stress, yield is often increased without the presence of these identified sources of stress. In tomatoes, increases in fruit yield are typically the results of increased fruit size.Pogonyi, A., Z. Pek, L. Helyes, and A. Lugasi 2005 Grafting tomatoes for early forcing in spring has a major impact on the overall quality of main fruit components. Acta Alimentaria 34:453-462 Research has shown that possible mechanisms for increased yield are likely due to increased water and nutrient uptake among vigorous rootstock genotypes. Conductance through the stoma was improved in tomato plants when grafted onto vigorous rootstock.[7] Nutrient uptake for the macronutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, were enhanced by grafting.Leonardi, C., and F. Giuffrida. 2006 Variation of plant growth and macro-nutrient uptake in grafted tomatoes and eggplants on three different rootstocks. European Journal of Horticultural Science 71:97-101Ruiz, J. M., and L. Romero. 1999. Nitrogen efficiency and metabolism in grafted melon plants. Scientia Horticulturae 81:113-123  Tomato grafting methods  There are a variety of methods for grafting vegetable crops. Cleft grafting occurs when a V-shape is cut into the rootstock and a complementing wedge-shaped scion is inserted. The graft is then held with a small clip until healing occurs.Oda, 1999. Grafting of Vegetables to Improve Greenhouse Production. College of Agricultural Education. pg 1-11. Osaka Prefecture University. Japan. Approach grafting involves notching opposing sides of the stems of the rootstock and scion, and then using a clip to hold the stems together while they fuse. Once the graft has healed, the original scion is then cut off of the desired rootstock and the unused rootstock is detached from the scion.Lee, J. M. 2003. Advances in Vegetable Grafting. Chronica Horticulturae 43 (2):13-19 Micrografting is a new technique that has been recently integrated into micropropagation production for hybrid tomato. This method uses micropropagated scion shoots that grafted onto 3 week-old rootstock seedlings.Grigoriadis, I., I. Nianiou-Obeidat, and A. S. Tsaftaris. 2005. Shoot regeneration and micrografting of micropropagated hybrid tomatoes. Journal of Horticultural Science & Biotechnology 80:183-186 The most common commercial technique for grafting tomato is tube grafting. Tube grafting takes place when the scion and rootstock are severed as seedlings and reattached with a small, silicone tube or clip.Oda, M. 1995. New grafting methods for fruit-bearing vegetables in Japan. Japan Agricultural Research Quarterly 29:187-194Rivard, C. L., and Louws, F. J. 2006. Grafting for Disease Resistance in Heirloom Tomatoes College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, ed. North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service. This technique has been highly effective as it can be carried out when plants are very small, thereby eliminating the need for large healing chambers while increasing the output. Tube grafting has been adopted as the primary method for vegetable grafting on the farm as it can be easily carried out with small healing chambers with typical success rates ranging from 85 to 90 percent [14]. *Approach grafting is done by cutting opposing and complementary notches in the stem of the rootstock and scion. The complementary notches are fit together and held with a spring clip or some type of tape. Once the graft union has healed, the root system is cut from the scion plant and the shoot is removed from the rootstock plant[12]. *Cleft grafting is carried out when the plants are slightly larger, and a V-shaped cut is made in the stem of the scion. The scion is then inserted into the rootstock, which has a vertical slice cut down the center of the stem. The rootstock and scion are then held together by a spring clip while the graft union forms[11]. *Tube grafting or Japanese top-grafting is carried out when the plants are very small and the rootstock and scion are held together with a 1.5‚Äì2 mm silicone clip or tube[15].

It is one of the first three colleges established under University of Delhi and is one of the best colleges in the country. The college admits both undergraduates and post-graduates, and awards degrees under the purview of the University of Delhi. It is one of the founding colleges of University of Delhi, along with Hindu College and St. Stephen's College. It is a co-educational college that admits students and select teachers from all communities irrespective of gender, caste, religion and physical challenges.

In its starting days, the college was run by the Ramjas Foundation - an educational foundation that runs schools and educational institutions in Delhi. When University of Delhi was formed in 1922, it was ungraded to degree level and brought under the University. Ramjas College has since been a humble part of that University. After formation of DU, the college was brought under government control but Ramjas Foundation kept looking over the administrative works of the college.

It sits at the far side of what was once a settlement site from the 3rd - 1st millennia BC. The monastery is a well known pilgrimage site, and was one of the centers of spiritual education in Armenia. Many fine examples of early Armenian architecture from various periods can be seen around the complex. The monastery is known to have had a brief visit during September 1734 by Abraham Kretatsi during the time while he was serving the Catholicos Abraham II while on his pilgrimage to a number of monasteries at the Catholicos' request. The Catholicos had said to him, \\"I have not traveled anywhere for a long time and my heart is very heavy.\\" In Kretratsi's writings he says that:  History and architecture  The Monastery of Saint Sarkis consists of Saint Sarkis Chapel of the 10th century, Surp Astvatsatsin Church (\\"Church of the Holy Mother of God\\"), an adjacent gavit of the 11th-12th centuries, vestibule, belfry, refectory, vaulted guest-chamber, housing for monks, and utility rooms. A fortification wall built in 1654 with fortified two-storey circular towers in three of the corners surrounds the monastic complex. During the earthquakes of 1679 and 1827, the monastery was reduced to ruins. The only structure left standing was the single-nave vaulted chapel that houses the grave of Saint Sarkis. He was originally buried in the village town of Namyan, but in the 5th century a delegation led by Saint Mesrop moved the remains of Saint Sarkis and interred them at this site. The chapel was damaged and left in poor condition due to the earthquakes, and shows some signs of emergency repairs. Restoration work was done on the chapel in December 2003 to spring of 2004, and recent archaeological excavations have started to take place under the patronage of Archbishop Shahen Ajemian headed by Frina Babayan. Archaeologists have cleared the collapsed structures and are currently (as of Aug. 2009) working to piece together parts of the collapsed church and gavit. Upon the hill nearby, there are the remains of an Iron Age fortress. It is almost nonexistent except for portions of the collapsed walls that once surrounded the fortress. Nearby down the main road that leads back into Ushi from the monastery, is a small chapel from the 10th century.

Altsek and his people arrived in the Exarchate of Ravenna, where Grimoald I of Benevento invited them to populate the Duchy of Benevento. According to the Gesta Dagoberti I regis Francorum, Altsek's Bulgars settled in what are today the communes of Isernia, Bojano and Sepino. Altsek remained the leader of the Bulgar-populated areas, bearing the title gastald. It is uncertain whether this Altsek can be identified with another Bulgar lord, Altsiok. According to the Chronicle of Fredegar, Altsiok deserted the Avar Khaganate in 631‚Äì632. Altsiok settled in Bavaria with 9,000 Bulgars under Frankish king Dagobert I. Altsiok is known to have moved to the Venetian March with his 700 remaining men after Dagobert I slaughtered most of his people. Paul the Deacon in his Historia Langobardorum writing after the year 787 says that in his time Bulgars still inhabited the area, and that even though they speak \\"Latin,\\" \\"they have not forsaken the use of their own tongue.\\" In later times they had evidently become completely assimilated. Human graves of a steppe nomadic character as well as horse burials dated to the second half of the 8th century AD attest to the presence of Bulgars in the Molise and Campania regions. Toponyms containing the root bulgar and personal names such as Bulgari and di Bulgari continued to appear in medieval documents relating to the Italian Peninsula. In the 17th century, Bulgarian Roman Catholics often visited Rome in their attempts to negotiate support for a Bulgarian uprising against the Ottoman Empire. Prominent religious and public leaders such as Petar Bogdan and Petar Parchevich spent time in the city. The first book printed in modern Bulgarian, Abagar, was published in Rome in 1651.

Both festivals of Eid celebrated in the Muslim world include cuisines specific to countries and localities. Eid-ul-Fitr cuisines Eid-ul-Fitr is also known as \\"Sweet Eid\\" because of the amount and variety of sweet dishes consumed on this occasion celebrating the happy end of Ramadan (which brings the mercy of Allah). Bangladesh, Brunei, Pakistan, Iran, Indonesia, India, Malaysia and the Arab world have traditional dishes to celebrate Eid. The breakfast of Eid-ul-Fitr are sweet dishes, including Boeber, a dish made by cooking vermicelli with dates. The vermicelli and dates, cooked separately in milk, are also consumed as breakfast before offering Eid prayer. Another variety includes balaleet, popular in the Gulf region. Depending on the locality, the types and forms of the cuisine vary but are always sweet dishes. In South Asia, chomchoms, barfis, gulabjamuns and different forms of cakes as well as roshmolai are popular. These are not only consumed inside houses but also presented to relatives and friends when visiting them on Eid-ul-Fitr. Baklava and other types of pastry type sweets are eaten in Turkey.

Before his retirement, he spent his entire career at the Department of Phonetics and Linguistics at the School of Oriental and African Studies of the University of London. Robin's work in linguistics covered several diverse areas, including Firthian prosodic analysis, endangered languages and the history of linguistic thought. He wrote two popular textbooks, General Linguistics: An Introductory Survey (1964) and A Short History of Linguistics (1967). Early life and education Robins was born in Broadstairs, Kent on 1 July 1921. His father was a medical practitioner.'ROBINS, Prof. Robert Henry', Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920‚Äì2016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014; online edn, April 2014 accessed 26 Nov 2017 In his childhood, Robins studied French, Latin and ancient Greek. He won a scholarship to Tonbridge School in 1935 and a scholarship for Classics to New College, Oxford, in 1940. He completed his university studies in 1948 with first class honours in Literae Humaniores (both Mods and Greats). During the second world war, a stint where he taught Japanese to Royal Air Force servicemen attracted him to the field of linguistics. Robins later obtained a DLit degree from London University in 1968. Career Robins served in the RAF Intelligence from 1942 to 1945 as language instructor. After completing his university studies Robins was appointed to a lectureship (1948‚Äì1955) in the Department of Phonetics and Linguistics in the School of Oriental and African Studies at London University. John Rupert Firth was the head of department at the time and was a major influence on Robins. Under Firth's directions, Robins carried out field work in the early 1950s on the now- extinct Yurok language of northern California and also did work on ancient linguistics. Robins later became reader in general linguistics (1955‚Äì1965), professor of general linguistics (1966‚Äì1986) and ultimately head of department (1970‚Äì1985) at the same institution. He served as dean of the Faculty of Arts (1984‚Äì86) of London University. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 1986. Robins was a research fellow at the University of California in 1951. He was Visiting Professor in Washington (1963), Hawaii (1968), Minnesota (1971), Florida (1975) and Salzburg (1977 and 1979). He was also a Leverhulme Emeritus Fellow (1990‚Äì1991). Post-retirement activities After retirement, Robins dedicated himself to promoting the history of linguistics. He wrote books on the subject and regularly attended conferences of the various national societies for the subject. He was emeritus professor (1986‚Äì2001) at London University. He taught at both University of Luton and University of Cambridge until the early months of 2000. Death Robins died at his home in Caterham on Thursday 20 April 2000 at the age of 78. Affiliations Robins was president of Societas Linguistica Europaea in 1974. He was British representative (1970‚Äì1977) and one-time president of the International Committee of Linguists (1977‚Äì1997). He was chairman of the Henry Sweet Society for the History of Linguistic Ideas at the time of his death. He was also an honorary member of Linguistic Society of America from 1981 until his death. Perhaps Robins's most important fellowship was that of the Philological Society, the oldest linguistics society in existence. Robins was its secretary for 18 years (1961‚Äì1988) and later became its president (1988‚Äì1992). After his presidency ended, the Society conferred on him the title of President Emeritus uniquely in his honor. After Robins's death, the society created a prize in his name, the R. H.

According to a 2011 report by the World Health Organization, annual per capita consumption of alcohol in Russia was about 15.76 litres, the fourth-highest volume in Europe. It has dropped to less than 10 litres as of 2019. Another dangerous trait of Russian alcohol consumption pattern was the high volume of spirits compared with other alcoholic drinks (such as beer or red wine).See, e.g., Korotayev A., Khaltourina D.

Russia currently implements a variety of anti-alcoholism measures (banning spirits and beer trade at night, raising taxes, and others). According to medical officials, these policies have resulted in a considerable fall of alcohol consumption volumes, to 13.5 litres by 2013, with wine and beer overtaking spirits as the main source of beverage alcohol. These levels are comparable with European Union averages. Alcohol producers claim that falling legal consumption is accompanied by growth in sales of illegally produced drink. High volumes of alcohol consumption have serious negative effects on Russia's social fabric and bring political, economic and public health ramifications. Alcoholism has been a problem throughout the country's history because drinking is a pervasive, socially acceptable behaviour in Russian societySee, e.g., Korotayev A., Khaltourina D.

In the 1540s, Ivan the Terrible began setting up kabaks (–∫–∞–±–∞–∫) or taverns in his major cities to help fill his coffers; a third of Russian men were in debt to the kabaks by 1648. By 1860, vodka, the national drink, was the source of 40% of the government's revenue.  20th century  In 1909 average alcohol consumption was said to be 11 bottles per capita per year. An estimated 4% of the population of St.Petersburg were estimated to be alcoholics in 1913. At the beginning of World War I, prohibition was introduced in the Russian Empire, limiting the sale of hard liquor to restaurants. After the Bolshevik Party came to power, they made repeated attempts to reduce consumption in the Soviet Union. However, by 1925, vodka had reappeared in state-run stores. Joseph Stalin reestablished a state monopoly to generate revenue. Soviet leaders Nikita Khrushchev, Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov, and Konstantin Chernenko all tried to stem alcoholism. Mikhail Gorbachev increased controls on alcohol in 1985; he attempted to impose a partial prohibition, which involved a massive anti-alcohol campaign, severe penalties against public drunkenness and alcohol consumption, and restrictions on sales of liquor. The campaign was temporarily successful in reducing per capita alcohol consumption and improving quality-of-life measures such as life expectancies and crime rates, but it was deeply unpopular among the population and it ultimately failed.  21st century  In 2006, a new alcohol excise stamp known as the EGAIS system was introduced, allowing to identify every bottle sold in Russia through a centralized data system. In 2010, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev nearly doubled the minimum price of a bottle of vodka in an effort to combat the problem. In 2012, a national ban on sales of all types of alcoholic beverages from 11 p.m. to 8 a.m. was introduced to complement regional bans.Khaltourina, Daria, and Andrey Korotayev. \\"Effects of Specific Alcohol Control Policy Measures on Alcohol-Related Mortality in Russia from 1998 to 2013.\\" Alcohol and Alcoholism (2015): 2015) 50 (5): 592. The Russian government has proposed reducing the state minimum price of vodka in reaction to the 2014‚Äì15 Russian financial crisis. In December 2016, 49 people in Irkutsk died in a mass methanol poisoning. Medvedev reacted by calling for a ban on non-traditional alcoholic liquids like the bath lotion involved in this case, stating that \\"it's an outrage, and we need to put an end to this\\". In recent years, alcohol-related deaths in Russia have dropped dramatically year over year falling to 6,789 in 2017 from 28,386 in 2006 and continuing to decline into 2018. Impact Disability-adjusted life year for alcohol use disorders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004. Demographic A study by Russian, British and French researchers published in The Lancet scrutinized deaths between 1990 and 2001 of residents of three Siberian industrial towns with typical mortality rates and determined that 52% of deaths of people between the ages of 15 and 54 were the result of alcohol abuse. Lead researcher Professor David Zaridze estimated that the increase in alcohol consumption since 1987 has caused an additional three million deaths nationwide. In 2007, Gennadi Onishenko, the country's chief public health official, voiced his concern over the nearly threefold rise in alcohol consumption over the past 16 years; one in eight deaths was attributed to alcohol-related diseases, playing a major role in Russia's population decline. Men are particularly hit hard: according to a U.N. National Human Development Report, Russian males born in 2006 had a life expectancy of just over 60 years, or 17 years fewer than western Europeans, while Russian females could expect to live 13 years longer than their male counterparts. In June 2009, the Public Chamber of Russia reported over 500,000 alcohol-related deaths annually, noting that Russians consume about of spirits a year, more than double the that World Health Organization experts consider dangerous. Economic In 1985, at the time of Gorbachev's campaign to reduce drinking, it was estimated that alcoholism resulted in $8 billion in lost production. Social In the early 1980s, an estimated \\"two-thirds of murders and violent crimes were committed by intoxicated persons; and drunk drivers were responsible for 14,000 traffic deaths and 60,000 serious traffic injuries\\". In 1995, about three quarters of those arrested for homicide were under the influence of alcohol, and 29% of respondents reported that children beaten within families were the victims of drunks and alcoholics. A 1997 report published in the Journal of Family Violence found that among male perpetrators of spousal homicide, 60‚Äì75% of offenders had been drinking prior to the incident.  Suicide  In 2008, suicide claimed 38,406 lives in Russia.H1 2009 demographic figures Rosstat Retrieved on August 28, 2009 With a rate of 27.1 suicides per 100,000 people, Russia has one of the highest suicide rates in the world, although it has been steadily decreasing since it peaked at around 40 per 100,000 in the mid-late 1990s,WHO Russia suicide statistics WHO retrieved on March 21, 2008 including a 30% drop from 2001 to 2006. Heavy alcohol use is a significant factor in the suicide rate, with an estimated half of all suicides a result of alcohol abuse. This is evident by the fact that Russia's suicide rate since the mid-'90s has declined alongside per capita alcohol consumption, despite the economic crises since then; alcohol consumption is more of a factor than economic conditions.Demoscope - Demographic, social and economic consequences of alcohol abuse in Russia Demoscope Retrieved on July 6, 2010 Treatment Prophylactoriums, medical treatment centres, were established in 1925 to treat alcoholics and prostitutes. By 1929 there were five in Moscow. Chronic alcoholics evading treatment were detained for up to two years. From the 1930s and 1940s until the mid-1980s, the main treatment for alcoholism in Russia was conditioned response therapy. This treatment has since fallen out of favour, and the modern mainstream treatment has become pharmacotherapy, which involves detailed analyses of each patient, medicinal treatment, psychotherapy, sociotherapy, and other support. Although Alcoholics Anonymous exists in Russia, it lacks support from the government and so is generally dismissed by the Russian population. One alternative therapy for alcoholism that has been used in Russia is the practice of \\"coding\\", in which therapists pretend to insert a \\"code\\" into patients' brains with the ostensible effect that drinking even small amounts of alcohol will be extremely harmful or even lethal. Despite not being recommended in Russian clinical guidelines, it has enjoyed considerable popularity. In recent years its use has lessened, due to the spread of information about its ineffectiveness.

This came amid a backdrop of plagiarism scandals that, among other effects, had forced her predecessor Ioan Mang to resign.

The building opened in 1926 as a luxury oceanfront resort hotel. The building has gone through multiple changes of ownership and has been renamed at various times the Hilton, the Wilton, and the Breakers International Hotel. It has had a history of financial problems and closures and operated for many years as a retirement home. The building has been designated as a Long Beach Historic Landmark. Development and opening (1925-1927) The Breakers Hotel was developed by a local Long Beach banker and capitalist, Fred B. Dunn. Construction began in the fall of 1925 with a projected cost of $2,250,000. The original structure consisted of a single-story base that spanned an entire city block with a central tower rising thirteen stories above the main body of the building. The complex also included arcade and basement floors beneath the Ocean Boulevard level. The development, with architecture described at the time as \\"ultra Spanish,\\" opened in September 1926. At the time, the total cost of the luxurious building was said to be $3,000,000. The building opened with a banquet and dinner at which Long Beach's Mayor Condit and Fred Dunn spoke of an era of success. The banquet also included a program of entertainment by vaudeville artists. When the hotel opened in 1926 (three years before the opening of the Villa Riviera), the building's imposing tower, rising 15 stories from the beach, gave it \\"a prominence greater than that of any other in the city.\\" On its opening, the Breakers was promoted as one of Southern California's finest luxury resort hotels. The hotel had 330 guest rooms and of prime ocean frontage in downtown Long Beach. Other features of the hotel included an elaborate 500-seat dining room known as the \\"Hall of Galleons,\\" roof garden, coffee shop, beauty shop, barber shop, Turkish bath, and \\"smart shops.\\" The hotel catered to \\"surf bathers\\" with a special elevator that transported the bathers, after they had \\"donned their bathing suits in their rooms,\\" to the Arcade level, from which there was an entrance to the beach. One of the hotel's unusual features was the availability of radio broadcasts in each guest room. An October 1926 article in the Los Angeles Times described the \\"outstanding\\" in-room entertainment feature as follows: > Each room in the new hostelry has four radio jets, each connecting with the > radio-receiving room in the tower. By plugging in on any of these four jets, > programs from broadcasting stations are heard ... If there is a particular > program on the air which a guest particularly desires to hear, it is only > necessary to phone the receiving room and the operator will tune it in. At its opening, the Breakers was available for both temporary guests and others who made it their permanent residence. The hotel was expected to \\"be the means of attracting thousands of people to Long Beach.\\" Years of decline (1929-1935) Less than a year after its opening, the hotel was sold by Fred Dunn to an unnamed group of investors from Pasadena, Los Angeles and New York. The sale price in 1927 was reported to be $1,750,000. The new owners announced plans for extensive remodeling, including the closure of several dining rooms and conversion of the ballroom into a summer garden. The onset of the Great Depression and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake pushed the Breakers into bankruptcy. The 1933 earthquake, which resulted in over 100 deaths, caused only minor damage to the Breakers, but the widespread destruction in Long Beach caused major damage to the city's tourist trade. The hotel served as the headquarters for the Red Cross relief efforts following the earthquake. In August 1934, the Los Angeles Times reported that the hotel had sustained a significant operating loss in 1933 and was delinquent on its real estate and personal properties taxes for the past three years. Hilton years and Sky Room (1938-1947) In 1938, the hotel was purchased by Conrad Hilton at a reported cost of $150,000 and $35,000 in back taxes. Hilton turned the Breakers into the eighth hotel in the Hilton chain. Hilton spent at least $200,000 on renovations and converted the penthouse into the Sky Room. In 1938, Hilton opened the Sky Room atop the hotel, and it became one of the most popular restaurants gathering spots in Southern California. Movie stars such as Clark Gable, Errol Flynn, Rita Hayworth, Cary Grant and John Wayne were said to have been customers at the Sky Room during the Hilton years. One customer recalled the Sky Room as follows: \\"It was a dating place, like the Brown Derby and Coconut Grove. It was the place to go.\\" During World War II, two pillboxes with gun-mountings were installed on the rooftop for harbor defense, and the Sky Room became the official Airwatch headquarters for Long Beach harbor. One of the pillboxes and gun mountings remained intact on the roof as late as 1991. Wilton (1947-1961) In 1947, Hilton sold the hotel to Frank Fishman, who renamed it the Wilton Hotel. The hotel remained the \\"Wilton\\" for 14 years. During the 1950s, the hotel changed ownership several times, and promises to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to remodel the aging hotel were not kept. An episode of The Lone Wolf, \\"The Long Beach Story\\", features the Wilton. Breakers International and closure (1961-1964) In 1961, the hotel was purchased by Fred Miller. Miller was one of the founders of Flying Tigers Airlines and purchased US Airlines in 1951. After buying the Breakers in 1961, Miller renamed the hotel the Breakers International and spent $1.25 million refurbishing the property from top to bottom. Miller reportedly hoped to \\"recapture, for Long Beach, the beauty, dignity and service of the city's greatest hotel.\\" However, even with Miller's efforts, he was not able to turn around the fortunes of the Breakers. In 24 months as owner of the hotel, Miller reported that he lost half of his net worth. In November 1963, Miller gave up and closed the hotel. The Long Beach Press-Telegram pronounced the hotel \\"a dead behemoth on the beach.\\" Others noted the hotel's over-reliance on convention business: \\"This hotel had to try to make 80 percent of its revenues from convention business. There is no rail service or air service to Long Beach, and the 20-minute run on the freeway to Los Angeles where the industry is hurts all the hotels.\\" One commentator opined, \\"God and Conrad Hilton couldn't have saved this hotel.\\" The hotel's head bellman, Paul Grantham, who had been employed at the hotel since 1928, blamed the \\"coming of the motels.\\" In January 1964, the hotel was sold at auction to pay off the hotel's creditors. Despite an appraised value of $4.3 million for the land and improvements, the property sold for $1.75 million. The high bidder, Long Beach realtor Harvey Miller, announced plans to convert the structure into a retirement hotel. The hotel remained shuttered for nearly three years and was referred to as \\"the West Coast's largest pigeon roost.\\" Retirement hotel (1967-1982) The hotel remained closed for three years as plans to convert it into a retirement hotel stalled. In September 1966, the hotel re-opened as a combination permanent retirement hotel and transient hotel for overnight guests. By January 1967, the property was occupied 70% by permanent residents who had the option of an American plan at $175 per month including hotel conveniences and three meals a day, or a European plan at $115 a month without meals. In 1975, the residential retirement hotel was refurbished again. The renovations included all new carpets, drapes, furnishings, automated elevators, and an updated phone system. The owners stated their intention to create the ultimate in retirement living for the senior citizens of Long Beach. In 1978, New Breakers Hotel Company sold the property to Stoneridge Management Company for less than $3 million. Re- conversion to hotel use (1986-1987) In 1986, the hotel was re-converted into a tourist hotel and placed under the management of the same company responsible for management of the city's major tourist destinations, the Spruce Goose and the Queen Mary. Before its re-opening in 1986, the hotel had undergone a three-year $15 million renovation and restoration. The new version of the Breakers opened with 242 guest rooms, including 20 suites, a restaurant and night club on the top floor, and a ballroom restored to its original 1920s decor. The Sky Room, which had been given a Polynesian theme by prior owners, was renovated in an Art Deco style. At the time of the re-opening, the Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"Its 60 years have been a roller-coaster ride of ups and downs, prosperity and penury, bright lights and gloomy emptiness. Just now, its direction is up.\\" The excitement about the Breakers' restoration was short-lived as the hotel failed to draw a sufficient number of guests to turn a profit. The hotel closed its doors again in January 1988. Designation as Historic Landmark (1989) In 1989, the Breakers, still vacant after its closure in 1988, was designated as a Long Beach Historical Landmark, requiring approval from the Cultural Heritage Commission before making any major changes in the building's appearance. Senior citizen housing (1990-2015) The property was purchased following its 1988 closure by Ocean Boulevard Associates, which spent $23 million on earthquake retrofitting and restoring its 1920s-style Romanesque architecture. The building re-opened in November 1990 as an \\"Assisted Living\\" Residence for senior citizens. As of October 1991, the Breakers had 38 residents with an average age of 84, paying rents starting at $1,000 a month, including three meals a day, housekeeping and local transportation. An in house Medical Staff provided medication administration and routine activities for those in need of leadership. The facility closed in March 2015http://www.presstelegram.com/business/20150330/residents-at-the-breakers- of-long-beach-get-notices-to-move-out after state authorities revoked its license.http://www.signaltribunenewspaper.com/?p=27842 Renovated Sky Room and Hotel Reopening (1997-present) In 1997, the Sky Room, originally developed by Conrad Hilton in 1938, was restored and re-opened by the property's new owner Bernard Rosenson. Rosenson restored the Art Deco look of the Sky Room and redesigned it to focus on its 360-degree view. The new Sky Room offered an \\"ultra-retro menu\\" and music by a swing and jazz band called the Sky Room Orchestra. In November 2017, Pacific6, a Long Beach based investment and development partnership, assembled by Long Beach businessman and philanthropist John Molina with partners Kevin Davis, Robert Gordon, Jon Heiman, Todd Lemmis and David Telling, purchased the building and announced their intentions to fully restore the Breakers and operate it as a 185 room luxury boutique hotel. The company plans to spend $60+ million on the renovation and the hotel is expected to reopen in 2021.

K. J√∏rgensen; Inorg. Chem.; 1971, 10, 1097. who applied it to the process by which, say, a hard ligand on a metal predisposes the metal to receive another hard ligand rather than a soft ligand. In fact, two superficially antithetical phenomena occur: symbiosis and antisymbiosis. Chemical antisymbiosis This is found principally with soft metals. Two soft ligands in mutual trans position will have a destabilizing effect on each other.R. G. Pearson, quoted in Anthony Nicholl Rail; Some reactions of a ditertiary arsine ligand; Ph.D. thesis; University College London, 1973. The effect is also found with borderline metals in the presence of high trans effect ligands. As illustration, the Selenocyanate ion trans to the soft carbon dioxide in trans-Rh(PPh3)2(CO)(NCSe) bonds via the Nitrogen, the harder of its two donors.J. L. Burmeister & N. J. DeStefano; Chem. Comm.; 1970, 1698. The phenomenon may be explained in terms of a trans influence: > ‚ÄúWith two œÄ-acid ligands in mutual trans positions at a class-b metal, there > would be a destabilizing competition for the dœÄ electrons on the metal.

A more definitive example are the halopentamminocobalt(III) ions, Co(NH3)5X2+, which are more stable when the halogen, X, is Fluoride than with [Iodine], and the Halopentcyanocobalt(III) ions, Co(CN)5X3‚àí, which are most stable when the halogen is [iodine].C.

The initials stand for Avtomat Nikonova model of 1994, after its chief designer Gennadiy Nikonov, who previously worked on the Nikonov machine gun. The AN-94 was designed as a potential replacement to the AK-74 series of rifles currently in service with the Russian Armed Forces. Due to its complex design and expense, adoption has been very slow and it is in limited use, and it most likely will never become general issue.\\"Tactical Small Arms of the 21st Century\\", Krause Publications; illustrated edition (March 2006) (), p. 288 As of 2006, production of the AN-94 has ceased. The AN-94 has the unique feature of delaying felt recoil for the first two rounds. This, it is claimed, increases hit probability under the most adverse combat conditions. The AN-94 offers a unique two-shot burst function at a stated 1800 rounds per minute. Design and operation Prototype of AN-94 assault rifle, also known as LI-291 AN-94 infographics The most conspicuous identifying feature of the AN-94 is its magazine which is canted several degrees to the right of center (when viewed from a firing position). This design feature is necessary to accommodate the unique ammunition feed mechanism. The AN-94 is chambered in the same 5.45√ó39mm M74 cartridge as the AK-74, and it utilizes a rotating bolt to lock the action. Gennadiy Nikonov and his engineers used the Russian term —Å–º–µ—â–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∏–º–ø—É–ª—å—Å —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∑–∞—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–∞ (smeschyonnyy impuls svobodnogo zatvora) to describe the rifle's method of operation, meaning \\"recoil shifted pulse.\\" When a round is fired, residual energy from the propellant charge in the cartridge acts upon the safely locked breech and bolt carrier. Simultaneously, a quantity of powder gases driving the bullet through the barrel is tapped and acts upon the piston in the gas tube located above and parallel to the barrel. The movement of the piston and its connecting rod acts upon the locking bolt, causing it to rotate and allow the breech to safely open. This initiates the extraction and ejection cycle for the first spent cartridge. After the first round has been fired, the bolt and carrier group move toward the rear, ejecting the first casing towards the front of the ejection window. The movement of the Carrier is directly connected to a pulley system which is connected to a small metal rod on the rear side of the magazine well. The rod pushes a second round into the firing position. Once this action has completed the bolt and carrier group will stop and move back towards the front of the gun before it has hit the rear of the receiver. When the bolt has fully locked it will fire the second round. This whole process happens very quickly and it is how the 2 round burst works. For any follow-up rounds, the hammer - in fact a horizontal striker, as opposed to the rotating hammer of the AK rifle - is held until every full recoil cycle is finished, to prevent the rifle firing at the extremely high rate continuously. This means that after every bullet the bolt and carrier group will travel the whole distance of possible travel, resulting in a more manageable rate of 600 RPM.

Development The Tern was designed by Hessell Tiltman & Nevil Shute Norway to gain records and publicity for the new Airspeed company, as well as to attract orders for new aircraft. Designed for hill- and cloud- soaring, the Tern was a wood-and-fabric cantilever monoplane. It was designed to be dismantled and was advertised for sale at ¬£248. Only two examples were built. Shute himself was the pilot on the Tern's first test flight.Nevil Shute, \\"Slide Rule\\", London: Heinemann, 1954 On 24 August 1931 the Tern was flown by Carli Magersuppe from Stoupe Brow, Ravenscar to Scarborough to gain the first British distance record of 8.3 miles (13.4 km). The glider flew a total of 16 miles but only the straight-line distance counted towards the record. The Tern was constructed of wood with a fabric-covered two-spar cantilevered tapered wing with no dihedral. A plywood leading edge was fitted but only as an aerodynamic fairing and not as primary structure. The trapezoidal-section fuselage had plywood lower sides and fabric-covered top decking as well as a generous cockpit in the leading edge of the centre- section. The Tern had some success in establishing gliding records but only one was completed and parts for one more were produced.

(formerly Television Communications Corporation). One of the ten \\"community\\" channels that were offered at no additional charge to QUBE subscribers was C-3, which exclusively carried a television series under the name Pinwheel each day from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Nickelodeon's concept prior to its launch was developed by Dr. Vivian Horner, who worked as director of research on the PBS series The Electric Company and who had created Pinwheel for QUBE (one of Nickelodeon's earliest series, which spun off from the C-3 service), along with Warner Cable CEO Gus Hauser. Nickelodeon was originally used as a loss leader for then-parent company Warner Cable. As the company saw it, having a commercial-free children's channel would prove useful in franchising its cable systems across the country, with that advantage putting them over rival companies such as HBO. 1979‚Äì1984: National launch as Nickelodeon The original Nickelodeon logo from 1979, designed by creative consultant Joseph Iozzi. Font by Lubalin, Smith, Carnase, Inc. Initially scheduled for a February 1979 launch, Nickelodeon was officially launched on April 1, 1979 (as the first ever all children's network) on Warner Cable franchises across the country. Nickelodeon's name was proposed by New York based creative director/designer Joseph Iozzi, who also created the channel's first logo and original advertising campaign. Iozzi saw the word \\"nickelodeon\\" as a natural fit for the proposed children's channel: \\"The Nickelodeon was a turn of the century device for dispensing entertainment. The sound of the word was nice and rolled off the tongue easily\\". Hauser ultimately selected Iozzi's proposal out of a list out of 150 names. The other proposed names for the channel included The Savoy Channel and The Rainbow Network. The first model ever used in a Nickelodeon advertisement was the designer's son, Joseph Iozzi II, while the logo's font was designed by Lubalin, Smith, Carnase, Inc. The intent of Iozzi was to replace the graphic of the line illustration of the man peering into the Nickelodeon with a period illustration of a boy in nickers, British flat cap, big suspenders, tip toed on a stylish iron train step looking into the Nickelodeon font. Available time and new management never permitted the planned re-design. The network quickly expanded its audience reach, first to other Warner Cable systems across the country, and eventually to other cable providers.Jay Bobbin. \\"Nickelodeon 20th Birthday from Green Slime to Prime Time, The Kids Network Celebrates with Lots of Special Events\\", The Buffalo News, June 20, 1999. Retrieved March 10, 2011 from HighBeam Research. It was distributed via satellite on RCA Satcom-1, which went into orbit one week earlier on March 26 ‚Äì originally transmitted on transponder space purchased from televangelists Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker. Despite its prior history on the QUBE system under the Pinwheel name, Nickelodeon designates 1979 as the year of the channel's official launch. Initial programming on Nickelodeon included Video Comics, Pinwheel (which was reformatted as a daily hour-long series that ran in a three- to five-hour block format, and was a precursor to the Nick Jr. block that replaced it in 1988), America Goes Bananaz, Nickel Flicks, and By the Way, all of which originated at the QUBE studios in Columbus. The network's original logo incorporated a man looking into a nickelodeon machine that was placed in the \\"N\\" in the wordmark; this was replaced the following year by another wordmark with the \\"Nickelodeon\\" text in Pinwheel's logo typeface. As Nickelodeon originally operated as a commercial- free service, the network ran interstitials between programs, consisting of a male mime portrayed by character actor/mime Jonathan Schwartz doing tricks in front of a black background. At the time of its launch, Nickelodeon's programming aired for thirteen hours each weekday from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. and for fourteen hours on weekends from 8:00 a.m. to midnight Eastern and Pacific Time. Premium cable network Star Channel (which later relaunched as The Movie Channel in November 1979) would take over the channel space after Nickelodeon's broadcast day ended. On September 14 of that year, American Express reached an agreement with Warner Communications to buy 50% of Warner Cable Corporation for $175 million in cash and short-term notes. Through the formation of the joint venture, which was incorporated in December 1979, Star Channel and Nickelodeon were folded into Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment (later Warner-Amex Cable Communications), a company which handled the operations of the group's cable channels (Warner Cable was folded into a separate jointly owned unit, the Warner Cable Corporation). New shows were added to the lineup in 1980, including Dusty's Treehouse, First Row Features, Special Delivery, What Will They Think Of Next? and Livewire. In 1981, the network introduced a new logo, consisting of a disco ball overlaid by multicolored \\"Nickelodeon\\" text. Late that year, the Canadian sketch comedy series You Can't Do That on Television made its American debut on Nickelodeon, becoming its first hit series. The green slime originally featured on that program was later adopted by Nickelodeon as a primary feature of many of its shows, including the game show Double Dare. Other shows that were part of Nickelodeon's regular schedule during its early years included The Third Eye, Standby...Lights! Camera! Action! and Mr. Wizard's World. On April 12, 1981, the channel shifted its daily programming to thirteen hours every day, now airing from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time, seven days a week. The Movie Channel had become a separate 24-hour channel by this point, and Nickelodeon had begun turning over its channel space during its off-hours to the Alpha Repertory Television Service (ARTS) ‚Äì a fine arts-focused network owned by the Hearst Corporation and ABC joint venture Hearst/ABC Video Services; ARTS became the Arts & Entertainment Network (A&E;) in 1984, after ARTS merged with NBC's struggling cable service The Entertainment Channel. Around that time, Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment began divesting its assets and spun off Nickelodeon and two other channels, music networks MTV and the (now defunct) Radio Television Station (RTS) into the newly formed subsidiary MTV Networks; in order to increase revenue, Nickelodeon began to accept corporate underwriting (a method common in public television) for its programming. 1984‚Äì1996: Laybourne era The fourth logo, and most popular logo used for almost 25 years from October 1984 to September 27, 2009, typically accompanied by various shaped backgrounds. The 1984 logo font is called \\"Balloon\\". Nickelodeon struggled at first, operating at a loss of $10 million by 1984. The network had lacked successful programs (shows on the network that failed to gain traction during its first few years included Against the Odds and Going Great), which stagnated viewership, at one point finishing dead last among all U.S. cable channels. After firing its management staff, MTV Networks president Bob Pittman turned to Fred Seibert and Alan Goodman, who created MTV's iconic IDs a few years earlier, to reinvigorate Nickelodeon, leading to what many believe to be the channel's \\"golden age\\". One of the many different variations of Nickelodeon's \\"splat\\" logo, used from October 1984 to September 27, 2009. Seibert and Goodman's company, Fred/Alan Inc., teamed up with Tom Corey and Scott Nash of the advertising firm Corey McPherson Nash to rebrand the network. The \\"pinball\\" logo was replaced with a new one featuring varied orange backgrounds (most notably a \\"splat\\" design) with the \\"Nickelodeon\\" name overlaid in the Balloon typeface, which would be used in hundreds of different variations over the next 24 years and 11 months. Fred/Alan also enlisted the help of animators, writers, producers and doo-wop group The Jive Five (best known for their 1961 hit \\"My True Story\\") to create new channel IDs. The rebranding went into use in October 1984, and within six months, Nickelodeon would become the dominant channel in children's programming and remained so for 26 years, even in the midst of increasing competition in more recent years from other kids-oriented cable channels such as Disney Channel and Cartoon Network. It also began promoting itself as \\"The First Kids' Network\\", due to its status as the first American television network aimed at children. Along with the rebrand, Nickelodeon began accepting traditional advertising. In the summer of 1984, A&E; announced that it would become a separate 24-hour channel as of January 1985. After A&E; stopped sharing its channel space, Nickelodeon ran text promos for their daytime shows during the night, then became a 24-hour channel in June, although some cable systems provided programming from a niche cable television service that had no room on system airing on the channel space, with BET being among the most popular choices. Pittman tasked general manager Geraldine Laybourne to develop programming for the late evening and overnight timeslot; to help with ideas, Laybourne enlisted Seibert and Goodman, who conceived the idea of a classic television block modeled after the \\"Greatest Hits of All Time\\" oldies radio format after being presented with over 200 episodes of The Donna Reed Show. On July 1, 1985, Nickelodeon launched the new nighttime block, Nick at Nite, in the 8:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. Eastern and Pacific time period. That same year, American Express sold its stake in Warner-Amex to Warner Communications, who in 1986 turned MTV Networks into a private company, and sold MTV, RTS, Nickelodeon, and the newly launched music video network VH1 to Viacom for $685 million, ending Warner's venture into children's television until they acquired Cartoon Network in 1996. In 1988, the network aired the inaugural Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards (previously known as The Big Ballot), a telecast in the vein of the People's Choice Awards in which viewers select their favorites in television, movies and sports. It also introduced an educational program block for preschool-age children called Nick Jr., which replaced the former Pinwheel block. On June 7, 1990, Nickelodeon opened Nickelodeon Studios, a hybrid television production facility/attraction at Universal Studios Florida in Orlando, Florida, where many of its sitcoms and game shows were filmed. It also entered into a multimillion-dollar joint marketing agreement with Pizza Hut, which provided a new kid-targeted publication Nickelodeon Magazine for free at the chain's participating restaurants. Although Nickelodeon had aired externally-produced animation since its launch in 1977, the network did not air original animated series of its own until the early 1990s. On August 11, 1991, Nickelodeon debuted their \\"Nicktoons\\" brand with three original animated series: Doug, Rugrats, and Ren & Stimpy. The development of these programs was a reversal of the network's previous concerns, as Nickelodeon had previously refused to produce weekly animated series due to the high production costs. The three series found success by 1992, resulting in the creation of the network's fourth Nicktoon, Rocko's Modern Life, which also became a success. Earlier, Nickelodeon partnered with Sony Wonder to release episode compilations of the network's programs, which became top sellers. Nickelodeon switched its distribution to Paramount Home Entertainment in 1994, with Paramount re-releasing episode compilations of the network's Nicktoons on VHS. Doug and The Ren & Stimpy Show both ended production around 1995; however, Doug would be revived in 1996 as part of ABC's Saturday morning lineup. Rugrats, on the other hand, returned from hiatus on May 9, 1997 (reruns continued to air up until that point), and became the anchor for the network as its top-rated program up to that point. On August 15, 1992, the network extended its Saturday schedule by two hours, with the launch of a primetime block called SNICK from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time;Virginia Mann, Record Television Critic. \\"Kids Take Their Piece of Nick's Prime Time\\", The Record, August 14, 1992. Retrieved March 1, 2011 from HighBeam Research. over the years, SNICK became home to shows such as Are You Afraid of the Dark?, Clarissa Explains It All, All That, The Amanda Show, and Kenan & Kel. In 2004, the block was reformatted as the Saturday edition of TEENick, which originally debuted on Sunday evenings in 2000. The Saturday night block continues today and was not officially branded from 2009 to 2012, when the \\"Gotta See Saturdays\\" brand was adopted for the Saturday morning and primetime blocks; the TEENick branding, with its spelling altered to TeenNick, has since been used on the Nickelodeon sister channel previously known as The N. After a three-year absence following suspension of the publication in 1990, Nickelodeon resumed Nickelodeon Magazine under a pay/subscription model in June 1993. In March 1993, the channel enlisted the help of viewers to come up with new shapes in which to display its iconic orange logo in the network's promotions. The designs chosen ‚Äì a cap, a balloon, a gear, a rocket and a top, among other shapes ‚Äì were mainly 3D renderings, and debuted alongside a new promotional graphics package in June 1993. The success of the Saturday primetime block led Nickelodeon to expand its programming into primetime on other nights in 1996, with the extension of its broadcast day to 8:30 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time (and later extended to 9:00 p.m. from 1998 to 2009) on Sunday through Friday nights.Brown, Rich. \\"Nick at Nite becoming Nick at Nite-and-Day; MTV Networks Inc.'s launching of classic TV channel called TV Land\\", Broadcasting & Cable, October 30, 1995.

In 1994, Nickelodeon launched The Big Help, which spawned the spin-off program The Big Green Help in 2007; the program is intended to encourage activity and environmental preservation by children. That same year, Nickelodeon removed You Can't Do That on Television from its schedule after a 13-year run and subsequently debuted a new sketch comedy show, All That. For many years, until its cancellation in 2005, All That would launch the careers of several actors and actresses including Kenan Thompson, Amanda Bynes, and Jamie Lynn Spears. Dan Schneider, one of the show's executive producers, would go on to create and produce numerous hit series for Nickelodeon including The Amanda Show, Drake & Josh, Zoey 101, iCarly, Victorious, Sam & Cat (a spin-off of the latter two series), Henry Danger, and Game Shakers. Also in 1994, Nickelodeon debuted the Nicktoon Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, which would also become a hit series. In October and December 1994, Nickelodeon sold a syndication package of Halloween and Christmas-themed episodes of its Nicktoons to television stations across the United States, in conjunction with then-new corporate relative, Paramount Domestic Television. 1996‚Äì2006: Scannell era On February 13, 1996, Herb Scannell was named president of Nickelodeon for ten years, succeeding Geraldine Laybourne. Around that time, Nick at Nite and the latter's recently launched the spinoff channel TV Land. In 1997, Albie Hecht became president of film and television entertainment for Nickelodeon before leaving to be president of the Viacom network TNN (now called Paramount Network) by 2003. Up through the 1990s, Saturday morning cartoons had been the most popular children's programs on television. In part because of the imposition of educational television mandates on all broadcast stations in 1996, Nickelodeon and other children's-oriented cable networks (never subject to those mandates as they did not broadcast over the air) now had an advantage in not having to have its programs comply with the mandate. By 1997, Nickelodeon's Saturday morning lineup had shot ahead of all of its broadcast competition, where it would remain for the next several years. Nickelodeon released its first feature-length film in theaters in 1996, an adaptation of the Louise Fitzhugh novel Harriet the Spy starring Michelle Trachtenberg and Rosie O'Donnell. The film went on to earn twice its $13 million budget. Two years after Harriet's success, Nickelodeon developed its popular Rugrats cartoon onto the big screen with The Rugrats Movie, which grossed more than $100 million in the United States and became the first non-Disney animated movie to surpass that amount. On April 28, 1998, Nickelodeon and Sesame Workshop partnered to put together an initial investment of $100 million to start an educational television brand for children and pre-teens aged 6‚Äì12. The \\"kids' thinking channel\\" was named Noggin (derived from a slang term for \\"head\\") to reflect its purpose as an educational medium. Sesame Workshop initially planned for it to be an advertiser-supported service, but later decided that it should debut as a commercial-free network. Noggin launched on February 2, 1999, and aired programming from both Sesame Workshop and Nickelodeon's archive libraries. On May 1, 1999, the channel previewed the animated series SpongeBob SquarePants directly after the Kids' Choice Awards. It became the most popular Nicktoon in the channel's history, and has remained very popular to this day, consistently ranking as the channel's highest-rated series since 2000. By 2001, a third of the series' audience was made up of adults, and the show was run in evening slots. A film adaptation of SpongeBob SquarePants was announced in 2002. The ensuing SpongeBob media franchise went on to generate over $13 billion in merchandising revenue for Nickelodeon. In March 2004, Nickelodeon and Nick at Nite were separated in the Nielsen primetime and total day ratings, due to the different programming, advertisers and target audiences between the two services. This caused controversy by cable executives believing this manipulated the ratings, given that Nick at Nite's broadcast day takes up only a fraction of Nickelodeon's programming schedule. Nickelodeon and Nick at Nite's respective ratings periods encompass only the hours they each operate under the total day rankings, though Nickelodeon only is rated for the daytime ratings; this is due to a ruling by Nielsen in July 2004 that networks must program for 51% or more of a daypart to qualify for ratings for a particular daypart. On June 14, 2005, Viacom decided to split itself into two companies as a result of the declining performance of its stock, which Sumner Redstone stated \\"was necessary to respond to a changing industry landscape.\\" Both resulting companies would be controlled by Viacom's parent National Amusements. In December 2005, Nickelodeon and the remainder of the MTV Networks division, as well as Paramount Pictures, BET Networks, and Famous Music (a record label that the company sold off in 2007), were spun off to the new Viacom. The original Viacom was renamed CBS Corporation and retained CBS and its other broadcasting assets, Showtime Networks, Paramount Television (now the separate arms CBS Television Studios for network and cable production, and CBS Television Distribution for production of first-run syndicated programs and off-network series distribution), advertising firm Viacom Outdoor (which was renamed CBS Outdoor), Simon & Schuster, and Paramount Parks (which was later sold). Nickelodeon Studios closed in 2005 and was converted into the Blue Man Group Sharp Aquos Theatre in 2007; Nickelodeon moved its live-action series to the Nickelodeon on Sunset studios (formerly the Earl Carroll Theatre) in Hollywood, California as well as other studio facilities in Hollywood and other locations. The company continued to film at the Sunset location until 2017. In 2005, Nickelodeon premiered the animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender, which became a hit series for the network. On December 31, 2005, the original incarnation of Viacom split into two new companies, resulting in the creation of CBS Corporation and a new incarnation of Viacom. 2006‚Äì2018: Zarghami era On January 4, 2006, Herb Scannell resigned from Nickelodeon. Cyma Zarghami was appointed in his place as president of the newly formed Kids & Family Group, which included Nickelodeon, Nick at Nite, Nick Jr., TeenNick, Nicktoons, TV Land, CMT, and CMT Pure Country. In 2007, Nickelodeon entered into a four-year development deal with Sony Music to produce music-themed TV shows for the network, to help fund and launch tie-in albums, and to produce original soundtrack songs that could be released as singles. The Naked Brothers Band, a rock-mockumentary series that tells of a pre-teenage rock band led by two real-life brothers who write and perform the songs, broadcast from 2007 to 2009; it was successful for children in the 6-11 age group. By February 2007, the band's song \\"Crazy Car\\" was on the Billboard Hot 100, and the soundtrack albums from the first two seasons, each of which signed to Columbia Records, were on Billboard 200. The only greenlit series produced under the Sony Music partnership, Victorious, ran from 2010 to 2013. A similar hit music-themed sitcom Big Time Rush ran from 2009 to 2013, and featured a similar partnership with Columbia Records; however, Columbia was only involved with the show's music, and Sony Music became involved with the series' production midway through its first season. It became Nickelodeon's second-most successful live-action show of all time after iCarly; Big Time Rush garnered 6.8 million viewers for its official debut on January 18, 2010, setting a new record as the highest-rated live action series premiere in the channel's history. In early 2009, Nickelodeon unveiled a new logo that would be implemented toward the end of the year, designed by New York City‚Äìbased creative director/designer Eric Zim. It was part of a year dedicated to strengthening the brand's identity. The logo was intended to create a unified look that can better be conveyed across all of MTV Networks' children's channels.Nickelodeon unveils new logo On February 2, Nickelodeon discontinued the TEENick block, as the name would soon be used for its own channel. The new logo debuted on September 28, 2009 across Nickelodeon, Nick at Nite, and Nicktoons, along with the newly launched TeenNick (named after the TEENick block) and Nick Jr. (named after the concurrently-running Nick Jr. block). The wordmark logo bug was given a blimp background in the days prior to the 2010 and 2011 Kids' Choice Awards to match the award given out at the ceremony; beginning the week of September 7, 2010, the logo bug was surrounded by a splat design (in the manner of the logo used from 2005 to 2009) during new episodes of Nickelodeon original series. The new logo was adopted in the United Kingdom on February 15, 2010, in Spain on February 19, 2010, in Asia on March 15, 2010, in Latin America on April 5, 2010, and on the ABS-CBN block \\"Nickelodeon on ABS-CBN\\" in the Philippines on July 26, 2010. On November 2, 2009, a Canadian version of Nickelodeon was launched, in partnership between Viacom and Corus Entertainment (owners of YTV, which had aired and continued to air Nickelodeon's series); as a result, versions of Nickelodeon now exist in most of North America. In October 2009 and September 2010, respectively, Viacom brought Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Winx Club into the Nickelodeon family by purchasing both franchises. Nickelodeon Animation Studio produced a new CGI-animated Turtles series and new seasons of Winx Club with CGI sequences. Both productions comprised Nickelodeon's strategy to reboot two established brands for new viewers: TMNT was intended to reach an audience of boys aged 6 to 11, and Winx was aimed at the same age group of girls. In February 2011, Viacom bought out a third of Rainbow SpA, the Italian studio that introduced Winx Club. The purchase was valued at 62 million euros (US$83 million) and led to new shows being co- developed by Rainbow and Nickelodeon, including My American Friend and Club 57. Also in 2011, Nickelodeon debuted House of Anubis, a series based on the Nickelodeon Netherlands series Het Huis Anubis, which became the first original scripted series to be broadcast in a weekdaily strip (similar to the soap opera format). Produced in the United Kingdom, it was also the first original series by the flagship U.S. channel to be produced entirely outside of North America. 2011 saw Nickelodeon's longtime ratings dominance among all children's cable channels begin to topple: it was the highest-rated cable channel during the first half of that year, only for its viewership to experience a sharp double-digit decline by the end of 2011, described as \\"inexplicable\\" by Viacom management.Viacom, Nielsen Investigating 'Inexplicable' Nickelodeon Ratings Drop, The Hollywood Reporter, November 10, 2011. The channel would not experience a calendar week ratings increase until November 2012 (with viewership slowly rebounding after that point);Analyst: Nickelodeon Posts First Weekly Ratings Gain in More Than a Year, The Hollywood Reporter, November 22, 2012. however its 17-year streak as the highest-rated cable network in total day viewership was broken by Disney Channel during that year. On July 17, 2014, the network televised the inaugural Kids' Choice Sports, a spin-off of the Kids' Choice Awards that honors athletes and teams from the previous year in sports. Since 2016, the network has begun to produce TV movies based on its older properties, including those of Legends of the Hidden Temple, Hey Arnold!, Rocko's Modern Life, and Invader Zim. The former two aired on the Nickelodeon channel, while the latter two premiered in August 2019 on Netflix. 2018‚Äìpresent: Robbins era In June 2018, Cyma Zarghami stepped down as president of Nickelodeon, after 33 years of working at the network. In October 2018, Brian Robbins succeeded her as president of Nickelodeon. In January 2019, Viacom acquired free-streaming service Pluto TV and since have made free channels for Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. respectively, including four new subnetworks: NickMovies (which shows a variety of Nickelodeon's live action movies; removed on August 18, 2020), NickGames, (a Nick GAS type of channel showcasing more newer Nickelodeon game shows; removed on August 18, 2020), Dora TV (an all day stream of Dora the Explorer episodes; including double-length episodes, though not including spin-offs Go, Diego, Go! and Dora and Friends: Into the City respectively), and Totally Turtles (an all day stream of both the 2003 and 2012 episodes of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). In August 2019, Viacom brought Garfield into the Nickelodeon family when it purchased its owner Paws, Inc., with plans for a new animated TV series. In mid-November 2019, Nickelodeon and Netflix signed a multiyear content production agreement to produce several original animated feature films and television series based on Nickelodeon's library of characters to compete with the new Disney+ streaming service. Known projects include a music project based on SpongeBob SquarePants character Squidward Tentacles and specials based on The Loud House and Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Toward the end of 2019, Viacom merged with CBS Corporation to form ViacomCBS. As part of the merger, CBS announced plans to add content from Nickelodeon to its All Access streaming service. Additionally, the National Football League announced that Nickelodeon would air a youth-specific broadcast of an early 2021 Wild Card playoff game that CBS Sports acquired the rights to, marking the first major live sporting event on the channel.

Ljungmans Verkst√§der company of Malm√∂ around 1941, and entered production at the Carl Gustafs Stads Gev√§rsfaktori in Eskilstuna in 1942. Some 30,000 rifles were manufactured in all for the Swedish Army. This was a relatively small number of weapons and the standard infantry rifle remained the 6.5 mm bolt-action m/96 Mauser. Norwegian \\"police troops\\" trained in Sweden during World War II were issued a number of Ag m/42s and brought these rifles to Norway when the Germans surrendered in 1945. These rifles were never modified to the later Ag m/42B version. After a number of issues had been discovered, including a serious problem with rusting gas tubes, the existing stocks of the rifle were modified between 1953 and 1956, and the reworked rifles were designated Ag m/42B. Modifications included a stainless steel gas tube, two knobs on the breech cover, a new elevation knob for the rear sight, a rubber case-deflector, new magazines and new cleaning rod. The Ag m/42B was replaced in Swedish service in the mid 1960s by the Ak 4 (derived from the Heckler & Koch G3). In the early 1950s the Ag m/42B manufacture license was sold to Egypt resulting in the Hakim rifle, which uses the 7.92√ó57mm Mauser cartridge. Sweden sold the machinery to Egypt and the Hakim was therefore built with the same machine tools used for the Ag m/42B. Eventually, the Hakim was modified into a carbine using the intermediate-power 7.62√ó39mm Russian cartridge, called the Rasheed Carbine. After being re-chambered to 7.62 NATO and having its trajectory adjusted, the Ag m/42 was used as ranging gun on the Swedish anti-tank gun Pansarv√§rnspj√§s 1110 under the designation Inskjutningsgev√§r 5110. Operation The Ag m/42 is operated by means of a direct impingement gas system, similar to that of the later, French MAS-49 rifle. The Ag m/42 also uses a tilting breech block like the Tokarev SVT-38/SVT-40, the MAS-49 and FN FAL rifles. The Ag m/42 is ammunition specific since it does not have an adjustable gas port or valve to adjust the rifle to various propellant and projectile specific pressure behavior. The Ag m/42 uses the 6.5√ó55mm cartridge loaded into a removable 10-round box magazine. In practice, however, the magazine usually remained attached to the rifle while it was loaded from the top with five-round stripper clips. Like the British Lee‚ÄìEnfield and Soviet SVT-40, the Ag m/42's magazine was intended to be removed only for cleaning. The ammunition used by the Swedish military from 1894 was 6.5√ó55mm skarp patron m/94 projektil m/94 (live cartridge m/94 projectile m/94) service ammunition with a long round-nosed m/94 (B-projectile) bullet. From 1941 onwards Sweden, which remained neutral during World War II, adopted skarp patron m/94 prickskytte m/41 (live cartridge m/94 sniping m/41) ammunition loaded with a spitzer bullet (D-projectile) Besides a pointed nose the m/41 D-projectile also had a boat tail to further reduce aerodynamic drag and replaced the m/94 ammunition loaded with the m/94 projectile for general use.6.5x55 Ammunition The Ag m/42 rear sight has two bullet drop compensation options, one calibrated for spitzer m/41 ammunition and one for round nose m/94 ammunition. Which one is installed can be seen between the sight screw and the range window. The bullet image (spitzer or round nose bullet) should match the ammunition used. With a hand adjustable elevation screw on the left side of the rear sight can be adjusted for bullet drop in increments.

The band was named after Communist revolutionary Che Guevara and painter Marc Chagall to imply the meaning \\"revolutionary art\\". All of the band members had histories within the Christian music industry, but the band was an effort to depart from the CCM industry. Despite this, the band still performed at the exclusively Christian music festival Cornerstone, and had their music (albeit against their wishes) distributed through Christian bookstores. The group formed in 1989 and broke up in early 1993. A Kickstarter drive appeared in August 2020 to release unavailable live and studio material, as well as two new songs. Background The band was originally formed by Taylor, Nichols, Perkins, Mead and Daniel Amos bassist, Tim Chandler - although Chandler quit during rehearsals DanielAmoscom Daniel Amos Timeline 1989 DanielAmoscom retrieved 2019-5-21 and was later replaced by Rick Cua who played bass on the band's first recorded track, \\"'Tale O' The Twister'\\" and later, Wade Jaynes who recorded with the band for their first album. The band first appeared on the soundtrack to the motion picture Pump Up the Volume with a song called '\\"Tale O' The Twister\\". The band's only album, the self-titled Chagall Guevara, was released on MCA Records in 1991. The band's only music video, for the song \\"Violent Blue\\", received a few plays on MTV. Several CD and LP singles were released off the album, including a UK release of \\"Violent Blue\\" with an unreleased B-side track titled \\"Still Know Your Number By Heart\\". Several songs from the band's 1991 performance at the Greenbelt Festival in England appeared on the official video \\"Four Days in Summer.\\" Work on a second album began, but the group broke up while attempting to be released from their contract with MCA Records. Several tracks for the second album were recorded, including \\"Halcyon Days\\" and \\"A Bullet's Worth A Thousand Words\\". These songs, along with a November 15, 1991 concert recording, remained unreleased. In 1994, a track titled \\"Treasure of the Broken Land\\" appeared on the Mark Heard tribute album Strong Hand of Love and the Orphans of God double-CD, which were sold mainly through Christian bookstores and similar outlets. The band reunited again in Nashville at a private industry party in October, 2005. In November 2014 the band partially reunited (with John Mark Painter standing in for Wade Jaynes on bass) at the Cannery Ballroom in Nashville at the end of a set by Steve Taylor And The Perfect Foil. On August 1, 2020, a live Kickstarter appeared to release the band's November 15, 1991 concert, entitled The Last Amen. The album would also be accompanied by a collection entitled Halcyon Days, to include rare and previously unreleased studio material as well as three new recordings.

The film was directed by Colin Eggleston and stars John Hargreaves and Briony Behets. Plot The story concerns a couple, Peter (Hargreaves) and Marcia (Behets), who, along with their dog, go for a weekend camping trip. The pair show incredible disrespect for nature, especially Peter, such as polluting, killing a dugong, throwing lit cigarette butts in dry bush, and spraying insecticide. As tensions between the couple escalate, nature is not pleased with their environmental wrongdoing and starts to strike back, first by an eagle and possum attacking Peter, and then through more insidious means.

Critical reception  AllMovie wrote, \\"Long Weekend is little more than an extended cautionary tale about the karmic foolishness of disrespecting nature. DVD Times praised the film, and also commented on its obscurity: \\"when an obviously well made and executed little thriller comes along, an exercise in controlled dread and eerie atmosphere that's really effective, you have to ponder the reasons why the vast majority passed on it. Early Australian cinema seems cursed in this category.\\" De Roche later expressed some dissatisfaction with the film: > Unfortunately, the bush comes across as a threat too early; it should have > emerged as a threat only after the audience had sympathized with the > animals. And I don‚Äôt think that sympathy is there. Long Weekend would have > been much better if the audience had been told at the beginning that Peter > and Marcia were going to die.

The event commemorated the 75th anniversary of CMLL, the oldest professional wrestling promotion. in the world. The anniversary show is CMLL's biggest show of the year, their Super Bowl event. The CMLL Anniversary Show series is the longest- running annual professional wrestling show, starting in 1934. The show consisted of six matches, with the main event being a Lucha de Apuestas, mask vs. mask match between Blue Panther and Villano V. It also featured four regular Six-man tag team matches, including a CMLL World Trios Championship defense and a singles match between Dr. Wagner Jr. and L.A. Park. Production Background Arena M√©xico, CMLL's main venue and location of the Anniversary Show The Mexican Lucha libre (professional wrestling) company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) started out under the name Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (\\"Mexican Wrestling Company\\"; EMLL), founded by Salvador Lutteroth in 1933. Lutteroth, inspired by professional wrestling shows he had attended in Texas, decided to become a wrestling promoter and held his first show on September 21, 1933, marking what would be the beginning of organized professional wrestling in Mexico. Lutteroth would later become known as \\"the father of Lucha Libre\\" . A year later EMLL held the EMLL 1st Anniversary Show, starting the annual tradition of the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre Anniversary Shows that have been held each year ever since, most commonly in September. Over the years the anniversary show would become the biggest show of the year for CMLL, akin to the Super Bowl for the National Football League (NFL) or WWE's WrestleMania event. The first anniversary show was held in Arena Modelo, which Lutteroth had bought after starting EMLL. In 1942‚Äì43 Lutteroth financed the construction of Arena Coliseo, which opened in April 1943. The EMLL 10th Anniversary Show was the first of the anniversary shows to be held in Arena Coliseo. In 1956 Lutteroth had Arena M√©xico built in the location of the original Arena Modelo, making Arena M√©xico the main venue of EMLL from that point on. Starting with the EMLL 23rd Anniversary Show, all anniversary shows except for the EMLL 46th Anniversary Show have been held in the arena that would become known as \\"The Cathedral of Lucha Libre\\". On occasion EMLL held more than one show labelled as their \\"Anniversary\\" show, such as two 33rd Anniversary Shows in 1966. Over time the anniversary show series became the oldest, longest-running annual professional wrestling show. In comparison, WWE's WrestleMania is only the fourth oldest still promoted show (CMLL's Arena Coliseo Anniversary Show and Arena M√©xico anniversary shows being second and third). EMLL was supposed to hold the EMLL 52nd Anniversary Show on September 20, 1985 but Mexico City was hit by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake. EMLL canceled the event both because of the general devastation but also over fears that Arena M√©xico might not be structurally sound after the earthquake. When Jim Crockett Promotions was bought by Ted Turner in 1988 EMLL became the oldest still active promotion in the world. In 1991 EMLL was rebranded as \\"Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre\\" and thus held the CMLL 59th Anniversary Show, the first under the new name, on September 18, 1992. Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, replacing their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. Storylines Villano V, who risked his mask on the outcome of the main event The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Due to an injury CMLL's most popular tecnico M√≠stico was not booked to wrestle on the show, only appearing as the corner man for Blue Panther in the main event. Panther's opponent Villano V would be accompanied by Perro Aguayo Jr., M√≠stico's longtime rival. With M√≠stico's injury CMLL was not able to book a match for the CMLL World Tag Team Championship despite repeated challenges by La Peste Negra (Negro Casas teaming with either Heavy Metal or Mr. Niebla). Instead they announced that Mr. Niebla and Heavy Metal would team up with Lizmark Jr. to face half of the tag team champions, H√©ctor Garza, teaming with Dos Caras Jr. and Marco Corleone in the third match of the night.

The show consisted of six matches, with the main event being an Infierno en el Ring (Spanish for \\"Hell in the ring\\") Steel cage match, contested under Lucha de Apuestas rules, which mean the last man in the cage would be forced to unmask. The participants risking their mask were: Atlantis, Blue Panther, Lizmark Jr., M√≠stico, Perro Aguayo Jr., Dr. Wagner Jr., √öltimo Guerrero and Villano V. The event also featured five Six-man tag team matches, including an all-female match. The event commemorated the 74th anniversary of CMLL, the oldest professional wrestling promotion. in the world. x Production Background Arena M√©xico, CMLL's main venue and location of the Anniversary Show The Mexican Lucha libre (professional wrestling) company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) started out under the name Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (\\"Mexican Wrestling Company\\"; EMLL), founded by Salvador Lutteroth in 1933. Lutteroth, inspired by professional wrestling shows he had attended in Texas, decided to become a wrestling promoter and held his first show on September 21, 1933, marking what would be the beginning of organized professional wrestling in Mexico. Lutteroth would later become known as \\"the father of Lucha Libre\\" . A year later EMLL held the EMLL 1st Anniversary Show, starting the annual tradition of the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre Anniversary Shows that have been held each year ever since, most commonly in September. Over the years the anniversary show would become the biggest show of the year for CMLL, akin to the Super Bowl for the National Football League (NFL) or WWE's WrestleMania event. The first anniversary show was held in Arena Modelo, which Lutteroth had bought after starting EMLL. In 1942‚Äì43 Lutteroth financed the construction of Arena Coliseo, which opened in April 1943. The EMLL 10th Anniversary Show was the first of the anniversary shows to be held in Arena Coliseo. In 1956 Lutteroth had Arena M√©xico built in the location of the original Arena Modelo, making Arena M√©xico the main venue of EMLL from that point on. Starting with the EMLL 23rd Anniversary Show, all anniversary shows except for the EMLL 46th Anniversary Show have been held in the arena that would become known as \\"The Cathedral of Lucha Libre\\". On occasion EMLL held more than one show labelled as their \\"Anniversary\\" show, such as two 33rd Anniversary Shows in 1966. Over time the anniversary show series became the oldest, longest-running annual professional wrestling show. In comparison, WWE's WrestleMania is only the fourth oldest still promoted show (CMLL's Arena Coliseo Anniversary Show and Arena M√©xico anniversary shows being second and third). EMLL was supposed to hold the EMLL 52nd Anniversary Show on September 20, 1985 but Mexico City was hit by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake. EMLL canceled the event both because of the general devastation but also over fears that Arena M√©xico might not be structurally sound after the earthquake. When Jim Crockett Promotions was bought by Ted Turner in 1988 EMLL became the oldest still active promotion in the world. In 1991 EMLL was rebranded as \\"Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre\\" and thus held the CMLL 59th Anniversary Show, the first under the new name, on September 18, 1992. Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, replacing their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. Storylines The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

His work, made almost exclusively using a homemade camera, has received widespread acclaim. Roma was a founder of the Department of Photography at Columbia University's School of the Arts and was head of the Department. He retired from his professorship there in 2018, shortly after the publication of a New York Times article about allegations of misconduct made by some of his former students. Roma has also taught photography at Yale, Fordham, and Cooper Union. He has been awarded two Guggenheim Fellowships and his work has appeared in one-person exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) and the International Center of Photography in New York City. Roma's work is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Art Institute of Chicago, and Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

Come Sunday is one of Roma's best-known works, along with a collection of photographs at people in the Brooklyn courthouses. Siciliano Camera Works In the 1970s, Roma started manufacturing and selling cameras under the name \\"Siciliano Camera Works\\". He produced the medium format \\"Siciliano\\", the 35 mm panoramic \\"Pannaroma\\", as well as a rewind crank for the Leica M2 and M3. To create the panoramic camera, Roma used a Nikon F camera body that was gutted and served merely as a film holder. He milled an adapter out of aircraft aluminum to go between the Nikon body and a Mamiya 50 mm Sekor lens. He also made a bright-line optical viewfinder for the camera. Roma uses a one-of-a-kind medium format camera that he built for himself. Books by Roma *Come Sunday (1996). With an introduction by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. *Found in Brooklyn (1996).

The official name of the Base is Campo D√©lio Jardim de Matos (1916‚Äì1990) after a former commander of the base and Minister of the Air Force. History In October 1911 the first aeronautical organization was created in Brazil: the Aeroclube do Brasil (Flying club of Brazil). The site chosen for its location was given the name of \\"Campo dos Afonsos\\" (Afonsos' Field) and an airfield was opened in 1912. On February 2, 1914, a Military Aviation School was opened at the site. The school was a partnership with the Italian Army, but due to the beginning of hostilities related to World War I, it was short-lived and finally closed on July 18 of the same year. On January 29, 1919, a French Military mission founded a new school of military aviation at Campo dos Afonsos. Because of this school, the Aeroclube do Brasil was forced to leave the location. For years they had no home but in 1936 it was re-opened at the Manguinhos Airport. Between 1931 and 1936, before a dedicated new facility was opened at Bartolomeu de Gusm√£o Airport, the Graf Zeppelin docked at Campo dos Afonsos during its stop-overs in Rio de Janeiro. In 1941, the Campo dos Afonsos became of exclusive use of the Brazilian Air Force and the new base was baptized as \\"Afonsos Air Force Base\\". Today it is home of not only two units, one battalion and one special squadron, but also of the University of the Brazilian Air Force, the institution of higher education of the Brazilian Air Force, and of the Aerospace Museum. In 2012 the aerodrome celebrated its centennial anniversary.

Ek is known for being the co-founder and CEO of music streaming service Spotify. Early life  Ek grew up in the R√•gsved district of Stockholm, Sweden.  Education  Ek graduated high school from IT-Gymnasiet (sv) in Sundbyberg in 2002, and subsequently studied engineering at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology before dropping out to focus on his IT career.. Business career Early ventures Ek's first foray into the business world began at age 13 when he started a business making websites for clients from his home. He charged the first client $100, but then charged the next client who asked $200. Eventually, he started charging $5,000 per website. To help expand the business, Ek recruited students from his class to work on the websites from the school computer lab by bribing them with video games. His earnings eventually reached $50,000 per month and by age 18 he was managing a team of 25. Ek's parents started to notice his earnings once he started bringing home large TVs.. Ek later served in a senior role at Nordic auction company Tradera which was acquired by eBay in 2006. Ek also served as the CTO of browser based game and fashion community Stardoll. Ek later started another company Advertigo, an online advertising company. Advertigo sold to TradeDoubler in 2006.. After selling Advertigo, Ek briefly became the CEO of ŒºTorrent, working with ŒºTorrent founder Ludvig Strigeus. This ended when ŒºTorrent was sold to BitTorrent on December 7 of 2006. Strigeus would later join Ek as a Spotify developer. Spotify The sale of Advertigo as well as his previous work made Ek wealthy enough that he decided to retire. However, after a few months Ek realized that money was meaningless without a project he was passionate about which led to the founding of Spotify. Ek first had the idea for Spotify in 2002 when peer-to-peer music service Napster shut down and another illegal site Kazaa took over. Ek said he \\"realised that you can never legislate away from piracy. Laws can definitely help, but it doesn't take away the problem. The only way to solve the problem was to create a service that was better than piracy and at the same time compensates the music industry ‚Äì that gave us Spotify.\\" Ek incorporated Spotify AB with Martin Lorentzon in Stockholm, Sweden in 2006. Lorentzon had previously worked at and co-founded TradeDoubler which had acquired Ek's previous company Advertigo. In October 2008, the company launched its legal music streaming service Spotify. Initially, Spotify ran on a peer-to-peer distribution model, similar to uTorrent, but switched to a server-client model in 2014. Ek serves as CEO of Spotify. In October 2015, Spotify Co-Founder Martin Lorentzon announced he would be stepping down as Chairman and Ek would be taking over alongside his current role as CEO. As of April 2019, Spotify has 217 million active users and as of June 2017 had raised over $2.5 billion in venture funding. In 2017, Daniel Ek was named as the most powerful person in the music industry by Billboard. Political positions In 2016, Ek and fellow Spotify co-founder Martin Lorentzon wrote an open letter on the blogging platform Medium to the Swedish government saying that if certain changes to Swedish law regarding housing, taxation, and education are not made Spotify will be forced to re- locate from the country. More specifically, Ek claims that the high taxes in Sweden on stock options makes it difficult to incentivize programmers to work at startups when startups have trouble competing with larger companies on salary. Moreover, Ek claims Swedish permitting policy is overly restrictive limiting the supply of affordable housing. Personal life In 2016, Ek married Sofia Levander, his longtime partner, at Lake Como. At Ek's wedding, Bruno Mars was invited to perform and Chris Rock officiated; he invited numerous guests, including Mark Zuckerberg. Ek and his wife have two children together. Net worth It was reported in 2016 that Ek owns approximately $825 million of Spotify (10.3%), when it was valued at $8 billion. As of 2017 Spotify was valued at $16 billion, which would put Ek's share at over $1.6 billion assuming he did not sell any of his stake. Since 2017 the Spotify Enterprise Value has risen to $40 billion.

Military service Johnsen was commissioned as a supernumerary second lieutenant in the 4th London (Howitzer) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, a unit of the Territorial Force, on 17 May 1913, and was absorbed into the establishment on 17 November. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 July 1914, and to captain on 29 April 1917, with precedence from 1 June 1916. Johnsen was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps, in which he was appointed a flying officer on 7 July 1917, with the rank of lieutenant (honorary captain). He was posted to No. 98 Squadron RFC, flying the DH.9 two-seater day-bomber. On 27 June 1918 he was appointed a temporary captain.The rank of temporary captain usually denoted an appointment as a flight commander. Johnsen's first victory came on 11 July 1918, by driving down out of control a Pfalz D.III over Don. On 18 July he destroyed an Albatros D.V over F√®re-en-Tardenois, and on 20 July shot down a Fokker Dr.I in flames. For these first three victories he flew with observer Captain G. H. Whitfield. His fourth victory came on 30 August, driving down a Fokker D.VII over Somain, with observer 2nd Lieutenant A. H. Fuller, and he repeated this feat for his fifth and final victory on 16 September over Oisy, with observer 2nd Lieutenant C. H. Thompson. Johnsen was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, which was gazetted on 7 February 1919. His citation read: :Lieutenant (Acting-Captain) Olans [sic] Charles William Johnsen. ::\\"A brilliant leader and gallant fighter. On 1st October this officer led a bombing formation against a railway junction, and, owing to his skilful leadership, serious damage was caused. Three big explosions occurred in the station, wrecking a number of trucks, and a factory nearby was demolished. He has taken part in thirty-four raids, eighteen of which he has led. He has accounted for five enemy aeroplanes.\\" He received his medal from the King at Buckingham Palace on 24 July 1919. Johnsen relinquished his temporary rank of captain on 3 December 1918, and was transferred to the unemployed list of the RAF on 2 January 1919. He resigned his army commission in the 4th London Brigade on 17 November 1920, but retained the rank of captain. Personal life On 5 February 1916 Johnsen married Ethel May Bowater (1896‚Äì1990), the daughter of Major Sir Frank Henry Bowater, Bt. They had eight children, six boys and two girls.

Located close to M√∏ns Klint on the north-eastern corner of the Danish island of M√∏n, it is deemed to be one of the finest examples in Scandinavia of Romantic English gardening. The park was created in the 1790s by French nobleman Antoine de Bosc de la Calmette for his wife Elisabeth, commonly known as Lisa. Liselund, roughly translated, means Lise's grove.Ulla Kj√¶r, \\"En virkeliggjort dr√∏m: Oplysningstiden illustreret ved Liselund\\" , Natmus.dk. Retrieved 10 December 2012. Background Arrival of the De la Calmette family in Denmark Lisa de la Calmette Antoine de Bosc de la Calmette was a Hugenot whose family had been forced to leave France for Holland. His father was a diplomat who after terms in Switzerland and Portugal, finally arrived in Denmark where, in 1776, the family was naturalised and recognised as Danish nobility. In January 1777, he married Catharina Elisabeth Iselin, the daughter of the Swiss baron Reinhard Iselin who had also emigrated to Denmark. In 1783, Antoine was appointed prefect of M√∏n. The same year, he bought six hectares of land on the eastern coast of the island in the parish of Magleby. Origin of the park He and his wife, who travelled widely, had become interested in Jean-Jacques Rousseau's philosophy of naturalism in the Age of Enlightenment. As a result, Antoine designed the park in the Romantic spirit of the time as a loving gift for his wife.Sven-Ingvar Andersson and Ingle Mejer Antonsen: Liselund on M√∏n, National Museum of Denmark, 2005. It was intended as a retreat where the family could spend a few days or weeks at a time, often with invited guests, away from the hardships of their working lives at Marienborg on the other side of the island. History of the estate Antoine and Lisa were not able to enjoy the park for very long. He died in 1803 and his wife in 1805. Their son, Charles, then took over Liselund but, after his death in 1821, it was sold to a friend, Frederik Raben-Levetzau-Huitfeldt, who died in 1828, and his wife, Emerentia Rosenkrantz-Huitfeldt, who died in 1843. The estate was then inherited by her nephew, Baron Gottlob Rosenkranz until 1884 when it was bought by his son Baron Fritz Rosenkranz. In 1936, it was transferred to his eldest son, Baron Erik Rosenkranz, then to Erik's brother, Niels, in 1956. In 1973, it was transferred to Baron Niels Henrik Rosenkranz until, owing to the increasing costs of maintaining the estate, the summer manor and park became the property of the Danish State to be administered by the National Museum of Denmark. The park Park from the south The area of land Antoine de la Calmette bought in 1783 was partly marshy, partly wooded. It bore no resemblance to the park which can be seen today, however natural it may now seem. The ground first had to be drained, cleared and levelled. Then, in accordance with contemporary standards, it was landscaped and planted with a range of trees, some quite rare, including oaks, sweet chestnuts, walnuts, mulberry, spruce and cypress. The park was designed to be poetic with the gentle undulations of its terrain and its many lakes. Indeed, water was a key element of any Romantic garden. But it also had contrasts, for example the sheer Devil's Ravine with its Devil's Bridge where, in rainy weather, water from the lakes cascades down to the sea. Today the park provides a quite unexpected experience for those who enter through the chestnet-bordered avenue leading into the park from the main road to the west. The old manor house Liselund: dining hall Liselund:corner of the entree Liselund Gammel Slot, literally Liselund Old Palace, is a rather small country home built in the French neoclassical style. It is exceptional in that it has a thatched roof. Like the park itself, the house was designed by Andreas Kirkerup, one of the foremost landscape architects of the times.Ole Eskling, Erik B√ºchert: Liselund park and manor house, leaflet, M√∏n Turistbureau. It lies against the slope of the eastern hill, beside a small pond, and overlooks the park to the north. The building is T-shaped with the main rooms on the ground floor, the first floor consisting of nine bedrooms. The interior was probably decorated and furnished by the leading decorator of the day, Joseph Christian Lillie. Many of the wall decorations and some of the furniture date back to the original design. Among the most impressive rooms are the Entr√©e, an airy room opening onto the garden, the spacious Dining Hall, the Ghost Room which was Lisa's boudoir, and the Monkey Room with its monkey mirror. The monkey at the top of the bamboo-frame mirror may well be in remembrance of a pet monkey who helped save the family during the Lisbon earthquake in 1755. Other rooms include the Family Room with several portraits, the Calmette Parlour and the Lady's Chamber, one of the larger bedrooms. While the gardens are open throughout the year, the thatched manor is open to the public with guided visits during the summer months only.Liselund fact sheet from Museer online. In Danish. Retrieved 19 September 2009. Other exotic buildings Schweizerhytten In the style of the times and in order to provide a more relaxing atmosphere, several foreign-looking buildings were spread around the park, each with its own character and designed to fit a particular need. The Swiss House The Swiss House or Schweiserhytten was built at the foot of a bronze-age tumulus close to the manor house on the verge of the entrance drive. It was originally the home of the gardener but it had some beautifully decorated rooms under its thatched roof where guests could stay. Chinese Summerhouse The Chinese Summerhouse The Chinese Summerhouse or Det kinesiske lysthus stands on top of the western hill and looks down over the lakes towards the sea. The weeping ash to the left adds to the Chinese flavour of the site. It was quite usual to include Chinese pagodas in romantically styled gardens. No doubt guests could be taken there for a short walk and a cup of Chinese tea. The Norwegian House The Norwegian House The Norwegian House or Det norske hus was built close to the cliffs in a rugged, hilly area, which seen through Danish eyes would resemble a Norwegian landscape. Its only Norwegian elements, however, are the sham logs intended to make it look like a typical log building. They are just rounded planks nailed to the constructive timber-framed walls. The steep thatched roof is a purely Danish feature. A typical Norwegian house would have a more gently sloping sod roof.Erichsen, John: Dr√∏mmen om Norge ‚Äî Norske huse i Danmark gennem 250 √•r. Copenhagen, Christian Ejlers' Forlag, 1999. The guest rooms inside are quite different with a Chinese and a Pompeian room. One notable feature is the small yellow glass opening in the shutters which gave the impression of moonlight however brightly the sun might be shining outside. The New Manor Liselund Ny Slot Liselund Ny Slot, literally Liselund New Manor, was built in 1887 by Baron Fritz Rosenkrantz whose father, Gottlob, had inherited the estate in 1843. It stands majestically at the top of the western slope, overlooking the largest of the park's lakes and the sea beyond. Built in the Italian style and decorated with fine ceiling frescos, stucco and wall panels, the New Manor was used by the Rosenkranz family until the 1960s. It was sold to the State in 1980 but lay empty for many years until it was bought by Krista and Steffen Steffensen in 1989 who converted it into an attractive hotel.The History behind Liselund ny Slot from Liselund ny Slot. Retrieved 20 September 2009. Ornamental monuments Monument to L'Amiti√© The parks contains a number of ornamental monuments, most concerned with love and friendship. The path leading down towards the manor house from the south passes a monument dedicated to L'Amiti√© or Friendship while another close to the stream down to the cliffs is labelled Endroit ch√©ri de Lise or Lise's favourite spot. The Hans Christian Andersen connection The wooden cross The park has had many well-known visitors, particularly during the period when Martha de la Calmette, Antoine's daughter- in-law, lived there as a widow for 57 years until her death in 1877. They included the Danish Romantic poet, Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl√§ger and the sculptor, Bertel Thorvaldsen, but the most famous of all was Hans Christian Andersen who visited the park in the summer of 1829 when he was only 24 and found it delightful.Hans Christian and Liselund, M√∏n, from Andersen Was Here . Retrieved 20 September 2009. Liselund must have made a deep impression on Andersen as his poem Klintekorset paa M√∏en or M√∏n's Cliff Cross was inspired by a large wooden cross at the edge of the cliff. The original cross fell into the sea in a landslide in 1905, but a new cross stands close by today. It is also believed that the large hollow willow beside the Swiss House could have inspired him to write story of The Tinderbox. Liselund in World War II Treacherous steps down Devil's Ravine Baron Niels Rosenkranz who lived in the estate during World War II was head of the West M√∏n Danish resistance group, perhaps the first in Denmark as it was set up just a week after the German occupation on 9 April 1940. Towards the end of 1942, the group began to rescue Jews living in Denmark and help them escape to neutral Sweden. Activity was stepped up in October 1943 when the Germans began systematically to round up all Danish Jews. In the dark of night, small groups of darkly-clad Jews were led down the treacherous paths from Liselund Park to the beach below where they boarded small boats which would take them to Sweden. Although the Gestapo suspected Liselund was being used as an escape route, they did not manage to find any evidence when they arrived on the night of 10 October 1943. The resistance group had heard they were coming and made sure no Jews could be found. Niels Rosenkranz was also a key member of the group who organised the rescue of 351 ex-inmates of the Stutthof concentration camp who arrived in a river barge at nearby Klintholm Havn on 5 May 1945, the day Denmark was liberated from the Germans.Erik Haaest: Aktion Prammen (The Barge Project), in Danish, Kertehuset, Copenhagen, 1995, 127p. .

Juhnke's page at The Aerodrome website Biography Hermann Juhnke was born in Laurenburg in the German Empire on 7 April 1893. He first served his mandatory military duty with Luftschiffer (Aeronautical) Battalion Nr. 1 before World War I began. In July 1915, he transferred to heavier-than-air aviation, entering training at Fliegerersatz- Abteilung (Replacement Detachment) 3 at Gotha, Germany. After training, he was posted to Flieger-Abteilung (Artillerie) (Flier Detachment Artillery) 238 in July 1916; they were an artillery cooperation unit. He did well enough with them to rate the Military Merit Cross, which would subsequently be awarded to him.Franks et al 1993, p. 139. He left FA(A) 238 for Jastaschule I (Fighter School 1) on 30 August 1917. After graduation, he was assigned to a fighter squadron, Jagdstaffel 41 late in 1917. He also flew with an ad hoc fighter unit, Kampfeinsitzerstaffel (Combat single-seater squadron) 5. However, Juhnke did not enjoy any success until he joined Jasta 52 on 4 March 1918. His first victory came on 2 May 1918, when he shot down a Sopwith Camel from 43 Squadron over Locon, France. Then, on two separate sorties on 5 June 1918, Juhnke shot down two British fighters, a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a and a Bristol F.2 Fighter. At 1405 hours on 27 June, he shot down an Airco DH.4 from 25 Squadron over Nieppe Forest. On 16 July 1918, he was belatedly awarded his empire's highest decoration for enlisted men, the Military Merit Cross. On 8 August 1918, he shot down another SE.5a for his fifth confirmed victory. He would claim another win in September, but it would go unconfirmed. Hermann Juhnke would survive World War I; besides becoming a flying ace and winning the Military Merit Cross, he had been awarded the Iron Cross First Cross. The latter decoration could not have taken place without a prior of the Second Class Iron Cross. Juhnke had also been wounded four times, which should have qualified him for a Wound Badge.

The event commemorated the 73rd anniversary of CMLL, the oldest professional wrestling promotion. in the world. The anniversary show is CMLL's biggest show of the year, their Super Bowl event. The 73rd-anniversary show was transmitted live on Pay-Per-View, something only a few anniversary shows before this one had been. The CMLL Anniversary Show series is the longest-running annual professional wrestling show, starting in 1934. The show consisted of six matches, with the main event being a Lucha de Apuestas, mask vs. mask match between M√≠stico and Black Warrior. It also featured five Six-man tag team matches, including the final match in a tournament for the vacant CMLL World Trios Championship. Production Background Arena M√©xico, CMLL's main venue and location of the Anniversary Show The Mexican Lucha libre (professional wrestling) company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) started out under the name Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (\\"Mexican Wrestling Company\\"; EMLL), founded by Salvador Lutteroth in 1933. Lutteroth, inspired by professional wrestling shows he had attended in Texas, decided to become a wrestling promoter and held his first show on September 21, 1933, marking what would be the beginning of organized professional wrestling in Mexico. Lutteroth would later become known as \\"the father of Lucha Libre\\" . A year later EMLL held the EMLL 1st Anniversary Show, starting the annual tradition of the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre Anniversary Shows that have been held each year ever since, most commonly in September. Over the years the anniversary show would become the biggest show of the year for CMLL, akin to the Super Bowl for the National Football League (NFL) or WWE's WrestleMania event. The first anniversary show was held in Arena Modelo, which Lutteroth had bought after starting EMLL. In 1942‚Äì43 Lutteroth financed the construction of Arena Coliseo, which opened in April 1943. The EMLL 10th Anniversary Show was the first of the anniversary shows to be held in Arena Coliseo. In 1956 Lutteroth had Arena M√©xico built in the location of the original Arena Modelo, making Arena M√©xico the main venue of EMLL from that point on. Starting with the EMLL 23rd Anniversary Show, all anniversary shows except for the EMLL 46th Anniversary Show have been held in the arena that would become known as \\"The Cathedral of Lucha Libre\\". On occasion EMLL held more than one show labelled as their \\"Anniversary\\" show, such as two 33rd Anniversary Shows in 1966. Over time the anniversary show series became the oldest, longest-running annual professional wrestling show. In comparison, WWE's WrestleMania is only the fourth oldest still promoted show (CMLL's Arena Coliseo Anniversary Show and Arena M√©xico anniversary shows being second and third). EMLL was supposed to hold the EMLL 52nd Anniversary Show on September 20, 1985 but Mexico City was hit by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake. EMLL canceled the event both because of the general devastation but also over fears that Arena M√©xico might not be structurally sound after the earthquake. When Jim Crockett Promotions was bought by Ted Turner in 1988 EMLL became the oldest still active promotion in the world. In 1991 EMLL was rebranded as \\"Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre\\" and thus held the CMLL 59th Anniversary Show, the first under the new name, on September 18, 1992. Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, replacing their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. Storylines The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

The novel is the second part of A Memory of Light, Robert Jordan's projected final book. Because of the amount of material to cover, it was agreed by Jordan's wife, Tor Books and Brandon Sanderson to break the final book into three separate books. All three books are written by Sanderson with the aid of extensive notes left by the late Jordan.Foreword by Brandon Sanderson to Book 12: The Gathering Storm The title Towers of Midnight was proposed by Sanderson, replacing the working title of A Memory of Light: Shifting Winds. It was released on November 2, 2010 and is 328,000 words long. The book debuted at #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list. Pre-release information On August 30, 2010, Tor Books, in conjunction with the release of Sanderson's 2010 novel, The Way of Kings, announced that Sanderson would hand out bumper stickers throughout his promotional book tour. Some of the bumper stickers contained a code which would unlock one page of the Towers of Midnight. Fans were able to guess the codes without receiving a bumper sticker and unlocked an entire chapter (Chapter 8). The final code was placed in Venice, Italy. The codes were the chapter names of Towers of Midnight. This event was promoted by Tor at Brandon Sanderson's request, and was able to generate an unexpectedly high amount of involvement from the fan community. Plot summary Perrin Aybara and Egwene al'Vere Moving through Ghealdan, Perrin Aybara and his followers encounter the Children of the Light, of whom Jaret Byar and Dain Bornhald accuse Perrin (correctly) of killing two of their colleagues. When Galad Damodred discovers his stepmother Morgase Trakand among the refugees, Galad and Perrin agree to a trial with Morgase as the judge under Andoran law. Perrin reveals his ability to speak with wolves and claims as his defense the fact that the two men killed his wolf friends; but Morgase judges Perrin guilty of \\"illegal killing\\" under an obscure law governing mercenaries. Perrin agrees to abide by Galad's ruling after Tarmon Gai'don; but Galad does not immediately pronounce sentence. Faile Bashere and Berelain sur Paendrag agree that Berelain will publicly denounce the rumors that Perrin and Berelain were paramours during Faile's imprisonment; whereafter Berelain attaches herself to Galad. Nae'blis Moridin charges fellow Forsaken Graendal with killing Perrin; and he gives her a ter'angreal called a \\"dreamspike\\", one of two he possesses, that hinders both Traveling and movement in the real world, as well as the service of his minion Isam. Graendal orders Isam to plant the device so that Perrin's Asha'man Jur Grady and Fager Neald cannot form gateways, enabling her to destroy his forces with an army of Trollocs. Perrin enters into the dream world to remove it, but is attacked by Isam in the process. Despite superior numbers due to the wolves helping him, Isam's mastery of the dream world enables him to easily kill several wolves. Not wanting anyone else to be hurt, Perrin takes the dreamspike and lures Isam away, despite his movement being limited by the device, eventually reaching Tar Valon, with Isam in pursuit. Egwene al'Vere plots to find the Forsaken Mesaana, while also dealing with a series of murders of Aes Sedai, but refuses to bond Gawyn Trakand as a Warder due to his disobedience; and when he confronts an intruder outside Egwene's chambers, it disrupts the wards she had set against Mesaana. Gawyn, while visiting Elayne in Caemlyn, learns that the murders are the work of 'Bloodknives', the Seanchan's assassins. Egwene arranges a meeting of the Hall of the Tower in Tel'aran'rhiod with the hidden agenda of drawing Mesaana into a trap while attending another secret meeting of Aes Sedai, Aiel Wise Ones, and Sea Folk Windfinders, to discuss cooperation among the channeling women of the three cultures. However, rather than simply spying on the Hall as intended, Mesaana and the Black Ajah immediately attack, causing a battle to ensue, with the dreamspike moved by Perrin keeping Mesaana from escaping. Mesaana attempts to hold Egwene with an a'dam; but Egwene's mastery of Tel'aran'rhiod enables her to break Mesaana's mind. Gawyn returns to Tar Valon to stop three Bloodknives from killing Egwene; whereupon Egwene awakens and bonds with Gawyn, whom she agrees to marry. On the Tower grounds, Hopper and Perrin fight Isam, and Isam kills Hopper, forever ending any chance of a rebirth for the wolf.Jordan, Sanderson, Towers of Midnight, p. 395. Perrin destroys the dreamspike by dropping it into a nightmare that has taken the form of a volcano. Perrin escapes from Isam by returning to the real world. Perrin feels compelled to forge a war hammer, and Neald discovers a Talent for creating a Power-forged weapon, resulting in a hammer that Perrin names Mah'alleinir, \\"he who soars\\" in the Old Tongue. Meanwhile, Galad's Children are unaware that they are about to be ambushed by the Trolloc army intended for Perrin. Perrin's army attacks first, destroying the Trollocs and saving the Children. Galad sets a light sentence for Perrin's crimes: he must make financial restitution to the families of the two slain men and he must fight in the Last Battle. Jaret Byar attempts to kill Perrin, but Byar is instead killed by Dain Bornhald, who no longer believed that Perrin killed his father Geofram due to the inability of Byar to give evidence in favor of the charge at the trial. Galad accepts Perrin's proposal to join Perrin's force and swears to remain under Perrin's command until the last battle is over. The Dark One's hand, Shaidar Haran, blames Forsaken Graendal for the deaths of three Forsaken (Mesaana, Aran'gar, and Asmodean), and begins to punish her. Mat Cauthon and Elayne Trakand Mat Cauthon meets Andoran Queen Elayne Trakand in Caemlyn to discuss building \\"dragons\\" (artillery) to former Illuminator Aludra's specifications. They bargain over who gets to keep how many dragons, and Mat agrees to let Elayne borrow the foxhead ter'angreal he wears to block the One Power, so that she can make copies. Elayne uses an angreal to weave a disguise, in an attempt to impersonate one of the Forsaken. She questions Black Sister Chesmal, but she is exposed after the arrival of Chesmal's Black Sisters Eldrith and Temaile, as well as the secretary of House Caeren's head Sylvase. She uses Mat's ter'angreal and a copy of it she made to defeat them, but after a surprise appearance by her Darkfriend former guard Doilen Mellar, she loses both medallions to him. In desperation, she uses the One Power to collapse the roof on him. She regains the original ter'angreal, but Mellar escapes with a copy. Mat and Talmanes lure the gholam into a trap; after battling the creature into a burning building, Mat wounds it with Elayne's copies of his own medallion, and forces it into a Skimming gateway wherein he corners and pushes into the endless void, dooming to fall forever. When Perrin and his group arrive, Morgase convinces Elayne to let Perrin administer the Two Rivers under Andoran rule. Elayne uses the dragons, and a promise of estates in Andor for Cairhienin nobles, to convince the Cairhienen to make her queen of Cairhien, uniting the kingdoms of Andor and Cairhien. Mat, Thom Merrilin, and Noal enter the Tower of Ghenjei to rescue Moiraine Damodred, who has been thought dead since she fell through a ter'angreal portal while battling the Forsaken Lanfear. Guided by his luck through an extra-dimensional labyrinth, the three ward off the cunning Eelfinn with fire, music and the threat of iron weapons. Upon finding her, Mat strikes a bargain with the Eelfinn for safe passage outside, offering them 'half the light of the world'-his left eye plucked mercilessly from its socket. Though they begin to leave, the snake-like Aelfinn chase after them, Mat having left them out of the prior bargain. Noal, revealing himself as the folk hero Jain Farstrider, offers to stay behind and buy the others time to escape. Driven to a dead end, hope seems dead, until Mat realizes his ashandarei polearm is their key to safe passage from the Tower, rending the walls and earning their freedom. Safe outside, Moiraine awakes to reveal herself severely weakened in the One Power due to her capture (though in possession of a supremely powerful angreal), and in love with Thom, who gladly reciprocates. As they share news of the world with her, they prepare to find Rand before the Last Battle is begun. Rand al'Thor Fresh from his soul-saving epiphany on the slopes of Dragonmount, Rand al'Thor proceeds to the world to fight the Dark One's touch, his positive demeanor righting the wrongs the Shadow had been allowed to perpetrate. Much to the surprise of all involved, he then embarks to the White Tower to deliver a stunning announcement to Egwene al'Vere, the Amyrlin Seat: he intends to shatter the remaining seals on the Dark One's prison in order to erect a more permanent replacement. Unable to convince him of the dangers, she concedes to meet him in one month's time at the Fields of Merrilor at his request. Desperate to delay what she could only believe was the doom of the world, Egwene hastens a plan to unite the nations of the world in hopes of stopping the Dragon's seeming madness. After dispelling a pair of powerful Darkfriends within his own ranks of Tairens, he Travels with Min Farshaw to the ruined port of Bandar Eban, which he had abandoned to starvation and decay. His demeanor and influence brightened, he quickly proceeds to set the city right on its feet, feeding the hungry and raising the downtrodden. He then heads north to the beleaguered fortress of Maradon, the main city of Saldaea, seized by countless Shadowspawn descended from the Blight. Though bravely fought by forces commanded by famed general Rodel Ituralde, the forces of Light are hopelessly overwhelmed, the city on the brink of destruction. Enraged by the plight of the men he had nearly consigned to death, Rand places himself at the forefront of the Shadow's assault, and repels the horde of tens of thousands single-handedly with an unimaginable amount of the One Power. Unfortunately he is unable to help the nations of Kandor and Arafel which also are overwhelmed by Shadowspawn. He now prepares to parley with the forces of the nations gathered at the Fields of Merrilor, poised precipitously close to the Blight border, and the advent of Tarmon Gai'don. At the end of the book, while sleeping at the Fields of Merrilor, the night before the parley, Rand hears a scream in a dream of a woman he does not recognize. Her face is different but he knows she is Mierin Eronaile, also known as Lanfear. She begs him to help her escape from the torture but the wall falls away and she tumbles into darkness. Aviendha Meanwhile, finally allowed to undertake the final test to becoming a Wise One, Aviendha journeys through the Aiel Waste, making her way to the ancient city of Rhuidean. During her trek, a wandering Aiel named Nakomi visits her and asks to share her fire; after beginning an innocuous conversation, the mysterious woman muses to Aviendha about the fate of the Aiel, once their toh to the Dragon has been met. The question perplexes Aviendha, and worries her, as it seems the Aiel might lose purpose and meaning once the Last Battle was fought. After arriving in Rhuidean and passing the final trial of the crystal columns (a comprehensive history of the 'shame' of the Aiel, as seen through her ancestor's eyes), she attempts to learn more of the ter'angreal through which she had just passed by touching them. This inadvertently reveals to Aviendha what may be the future of the Aiel, where her own descendants begin a chain of events that would allow the Seanchan to overtake the wetlands, drive the Aiel into hiding, and systematically reduce them to pathetic scavengers, all knowledge of ji'e'toh abandoned, and finally driven to extinction. Faced with this crushing possibility, Aviendha leaves Rhuidean to find Rand, desperate for any chance to right this grim future. The Black Tower Mazrim Taim is ruling the black tower with an iron fist. Logain has been absent from the Black Tower for some time. Several of the Aes Sedai who have traveled to the tower originally sent by the leader of the Red Ajah have been given permission to bond some of the Soldiers and Dedicated, however, none have been bonded. The entirety of the Tower is guarded, entry and exit are strictly monitored, and the behavior of many Aes Sedai and Asha'man have changed significantly and disturbingly; some of Taim's most ardent detractors seem only to sing his praises, and behave as if in hollow imitation of themselves. Gateways fail upon construction, confining those within Tower grounds to the watch of Taim and his faithful. A small group of Soldiers and Dedicated, denied the Dragon even though their skills may warrant it, take notice of the darkness that seems to grip the Tower and its inhabitants, and desperately try to glean Taim's intentions while managing their own escape to Logain and the Dragon Reborn.

She was the second or third wife of pharaoh Khufu and most possibly buried at Giza.  Identity   Life  Little is known about Henutsen's life. Some scholars believe, that she was the daughter of pharaoh Sneferu,Joyce A. Tyldesley: Chronicle of the Queens of Egypt: From Early Dynastic Times to the Death of Cleopatra. Thames & Hudson, New York 2006, , p. 36 & 45. but this is not commonly accepted. Henutsen is not known to have ever borne the title \\"king's daughter\\" or \\"king's bodily daughter\\", both titles which would have unmistakably designated her as a princess. The only document describing her as a princess is the famous Inventory Stela from 26th Dynasty (Saite Period). The artifact is identified by scholars as a contemporary fake created by Saitic priests, thus the information about Henutsen's royal status as a princess are questioned.Peter J√°nosi: Die Pyramidenanlagen der K√∂niginnen (= Denkschriften der Gesamtakademie, √ñsterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften, volume 13). Vienna 1996, , p. 11, 125. The only royal title that is proven for her is the title of a \\"king's wife\\".Zahi A. Hawass: Mountains of the Pharaohs: The Untold Story of the Pyramid Builders. Doubleday, New York 2006, , p. 91-96.  Children  Henutsen is known to have given birth to at least two princes, Khufukhaf and Minkhaf. In case that Khufukhaf was not identical to king Khafra, Henutsen was Khafra's mother, too. All her sons are buried at Giza. The mastaba tomb of Khufukhaf was partially destroyed during the Middle Kingdom Period in attempt to make place for a temple of the goddess Isis.  Burial  Henutsen was most possibly interred in Pyramid G1-c. Egyptologists believe that this pyramid was originally not part of Khufu's pyramid complex, but later added, as its southern side is not aligned with that of the Great Pyramid. In fact, the pyramid's southern side is aligned with Khufukhaf's mastaba tomb nearby. Rainer Stadelmann additionally believes that prince Khufukhaf was identical to king Khafra and that Khafra erected G1-c as the tomb for his (now royal) mother.Miroslav Verner: The Pyramids: The Mystery, Culture, and Science of Egypt's Great Monuments. Grove Press, New York 2007, , page 212. Pyramid G1-c was long time thought to be a satellite pyramid, because it did not come with a boat pit, as it was the case for the pyramids Pyramid G1-a and Pyramid G1-b. G1-c was later identified as an unfinished pyramid which was constructed in a hurry.Zahi Hawass: The Discovery of the Satellite Pyramid of Khufu (G1-d).

It was a single-engined biplane with considerable negative stagger. It was not successful, the Bristol F.2 Fighter (already in production) being preferred by the Royal Flying Corps. Development and design In the summer of 1917, the Sopwith Aviation Company designed a two- seat fighter aircraft, the 3F.2 Hippo, possibly to replace the Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter in French service.Robertson 1970, p. 228. While the British Air Board did not place an order for the Hippo, it did grant Sopwith a licence to allow it to build prototypes as a private venture. The Hippo was designed to give the best possible view to the pilot and gunner, which dictated the aircraft's shape. Its two-bay wings had heavy (2 ft 3 in (0.69 m)Robertson 1970, p. 236.) negative stagger, with the pilot sitting ahead of the upper wing and the gunner sitting behind the rear spar of the upper wing. The fuselage filled the gap between the wings, with the crew's heads level with the upper wing and cutouts in the wing's forward and trailing edges for the pilot and gunner.Bruce 1969, pp. 4‚Äì5. The pilot was armed with two synchronised Vickers machine guns, while the observer was provided with two Lewis guns on a rocking pillar mount. It was powered by a Clerget 11 eleven-cylinder rotary engine, chosen as it was not heavily used.Mason 1992, p. 123. The first prototype Hippo flew on 13 September 1917.Green and Swanborough 1994, p. 538. When tested, it was found to have sluggish controls and poorer performance than the Bristol F.2 Fighter which was already in service.Bruce 1969, p. 5. Despite these results, which meant that there was little chance of it being built for the Royal Flying Corps, Sopwith rebuilt the Hippo, with increased dihedral on the upper wing, reduced wing stagger and an enlarged tailfin. The crude rocking pillar mount for the gunner's Lewis guns was replaced by a more conventional Scarff ring mounting a single Lewis gun.Bruce 1969, pp. 5‚Äì6. The rebuilt prototype flew in April 1918, with a second prototype following in June. No further production followed. Specifications See also Notes Some sources suggest that, rather than a rebuilt first prototype, that the Hippo with reduced stagger was a new aircraft. References *Bruce, J. M.

His valorous military service was matched by his devotion to serving his home town and community in peacetime. Early life Conrad Tolendahl Lally was the sole child born to Lucy Fedora Wells and Conrad Colthurst Whitley Lally; he arrived in 1882. His noble French General great-grandfather had fought the British in India. His grandfather served through three wars in China with the Royal Navy before emigrating to Canada. Young Lally was educated at private schools before matriculating at Upper Canada College. After graduation, he went into banking, opening and managing the first Imperial Bank of Canada branch in Banff in 1906. Two years later, he moved to Wainwright, Alberta to go partners in a general store. He became active in civic affairs, becoming mayor. However, as World War I erupted, he volunteered for military service with the Royal Flying Corps. World War I In December 1915, Lally received orders for pilot's training at Reading University in England. On Christmas Day, he left his business and mayoralty for St. John's, Newfoundland. A ten-day voyage aboard the RMS Metagama took him across the ocean. He began aviation training on 24 January 1916, flying 13 minutes in a dual control craft. By the time he graduated on 24 June 1916, he had garnered 22 hours 4 minutes flight time in his log. Circa 26 June 1916, Lally was appointed a Flying Officer with the rank of second lieutenant.There is an illegible date after his name, although he is listed bottom of the 26 June 1916 list. Another source says 24 June 1916 is the actual date. Because of his natural talent, he was posted to 24 Flying Training Squadron as an instructor. During the next eight months, he would accumulate 329 hours of flight time. On 25 April 1917, he was posted as a pilot to 25 Squadron, which was equipped with two-seater Royal Aircraft Factory FE.2 bombers. On 7 June 1917, with Lieutenant L. F. Williams manning the observer's guns, the two of them drove down a German Albatros D.III fighter out of control and destroyed another west of Lille. The squadron then upgraded to Airco DH.4 bombers. On 5 August 1917, with Basil Blackett at the observer's guns, Lally used his new machine to destroy an Albatros D.V over Perenchies. On 3 September 1917, the new team drove an Albatros D.V down over Quesnoy in mid-morning and another one over Douai in the evening.Retrieved 20 February 2011. The following day, 4 September 1917, the new ace was appointed a Flight Commander with its accompanying promotion to temporary captain. His aerial victories, however, were secondary to his main duties of bombarding the enemy and taking aerial photographs of his dispositions. These were the milieu of the valorous deeds that earned him both awards of the Military Cross. His first award, the Military Cross, came on 29 November 1917, when he was invested in London, though it would not be gazetted until 18 January 1918. It would be followed up in July 1918 with a Bar in lieu of a second award.(Flight, 11 July 1918) http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1918/1918%20-%200764.html?search=conrad%20lally Retrieved 20 February 2011. On 3 September 1918, Lally crashed into a tree and put himself into hospital for two months with a thrice-fractured jaw and smashed face. He returned to flying on 4 November 1918, one week before the Armistice. Post World War I On 12 December 1919, Lally was granted a short service commission in the Royal Air Force as aFlight Lieutenant. On 10 January 1920, he was put on the RAF's unemployed list. Lally returned to Wainwright and became the postmaster in 1923. The next year, he married Mary Beryl Rodden; the union would produce a daughter. Lally also returned to public and community service. In the public sphere, he served a second term as mayor, presided as a police magistrate, was president of the local board of trade, and oversaw the schools as a trustee. He also captained the town's hockey team, master of the local Masonic lodge, and supported the Anglican Church. Honors and awards Military Cross citation Lt. (T./Capt.) Conrad T. Lally, R.F.C., Spec. Res. For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in many bomb raids and photographic and long-distance reconnaissances, many of which he has led most successfully. He has taken part in numerous combats and has destroyed three hostile positions. When ordered to bomb a position he spent 1 1/2 hours looking for it, then returned for more petrol and at the second attempt dropped a bomb, on it and with another set a dump on fire, under most difficult weather conditions. Bar to the Military Cross Lt. (T./Capt.) Conrad T. Lally, M.C., R.F.C., Spec. Res. For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. Flying through and above the clouds, he released his bombs over his objective, well behind the enemy lines, at a height of 500 feet, under heavy fire. On two later occasions he carried out photographic reconnaissances of hostile aerodromes under very bad weather conditions, on account of which several other machines had to give up the journey. He has shown himself to be a most determined and successful leader, his example of courage and skill being of great advantage to his squadron. On 2 November 1918, he was awarded the Air Force Cross as part of the new medal's inauguration. It would be actually presented to him in March 1921 by Lieutenant Governor Dr. Robert Brett.

Credulity, Merriam-Webster, Inc., retrieved June 24, 2020 Credulity is not necessarily a belief in something that may be false: the subject of the belief may even be correct, but a credulous person will believe it without good evidence. Meaning The words gullible and credulous are commonly used as synonyms. state that while both words mean \\"unduly trusting or confiding\\", gullibility stresses being duped or made a fool of, suggesting a lack of intelligence, whereas credulity stresses uncritically forming beliefs, suggesting a lack of skepticism. states the difference is a matter of degree: the gullible are \\"the easiest to deceive\\", while the credulous are \\"a little too quick to believe something, but they usually aren't stupid enough to act on it.\\" characterize a gullible person as one who is both credulous and na√Øve. stresses the distinction that gullibility involves an action in addition to a belief, and there is a cause- effect relationship between the two states: \\"gullible outcomes typically come about through the exploitation of a victim's credulity. Examples Many societies mark April Fools' Day or All Fools' Day on April 1 each year. The day features the commission of hoaxes and other practical jokes of varying sophistication on friends, family members, enemies, and neighbors, or sending them on a fool's errand, the aim of which is to embarrass the gullible. Cold reading, a magic trick that gives the appearance of a psychic experience, relies on the credulous belief of an audience that something psychic is occurring. Hence the audience fits the utterances of the cold reader to be consistent with psychic abilities, while ignoring any contrary evidence. A confidence trick or confidence game is an attempt to defraud a person or group by gaining their confidence. Confidence artists exploit human characteristics such as greed and dishonesty, and have victimized individuals from all walks of life. Politics and practical jokes are also related to credulity.

Abstract online at www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/32148/ABSTRACT; retrieved 6 November. 2006 A religion is a system of human thought which usually includes a set of narratives, symbols, beliefs and practices that give meaning to the practitioner's experiences of life through reference to a higher power, God or gods, or ultimate truth.While religion is difficult to define, the standard model of religion as used in religious studies was defined by Clifford Geertz (Religion as a Cultural System, 1973). For an influential critique of Geertz's model see Talal Asad's The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category (1982). Atheists and members of other religions may regard many other religious faiths as credulous cults. Compare: A snipe hunt, a form of wild- goose chase that is also known as a fool's errand, is a type of practical joke that involves experienced people making fun of credulous newcomers by giving them an impossible or imaginary task. The origin of the term is a practical joke where inexperienced campers are told about a bird or animal called the snipe as well as a usually preposterous method of catching it, such as running around the woods carrying a bag or making strange noises.Etymonline.com - snipe Superstition is a credulous belief or notion, not based on reason or knowledge. The word \\"superstition\\" is often used pejoratively to refer to folk beliefs deemed irrational. This leads to some superstitions being called \\"old wives' tales.\\" It is also commonly applied to beliefs and practices surrounding luck, prophecy and spiritual beings, particularly the irrational belief that future events can be influenced or foretold by specific unrelated prior events.

Twenty-nine made it out themselves but the rest had to be assisted. Emergency services ferried the casualties to the nearest hospitals. Eighteen were hospitalised at a burns specialist unit in Siemianowice ≈ölƒÖskie; six were hospitalised at Sosnowiec where family members collected outside in an upset manner. Some of the deaths came quickly, whilst more did not die until some time later. Deaths were caused by burns, some of 90 degree proportions, with burns sustained to the respiratory tract. Many will require psychological assistance as well if they are to fully recover from the incident. Production was stopped but the rest of the mine remained in operation. The fire was quenched. The probable cause is thought to be methane ignition.  Investigation  An investigation into the incident was quickly launched.

In Aspects, Chomsky presented a deeper, more extensive reformulation of transformational generative grammar (TGG), a new kind of syntactic theory that he had introduced in the 1950s with the publication of his first book, Syntactic Structures. Aspects is widely considered to be the foundational document and a proper book-length articulation of Chomskyan theoretical framework of linguistics.Gallego and Ott 2015 : 249 It presented Chomsky's epistemological assumptions with a view to establishing linguistic theory-making as a formal (i.e. based on the manipulation of symbols and rules) discipline comparable to physical sciences, i.e. a domain of inquiry well-defined in its nature and scope. From a philosophical perspective, it directed mainstream linguistic research away from behaviorism, constructivism, empiricism and structuralism and towards mentalism, nativism, rationalism and generativism, respectively, taking as its main object of study the abstract, inner workings of the human mind related to language acquisition and production. Background After the publication of Chomsky's Syntactic Structures, the nature of linguistic research began to change, especially at MIT and elsewhere in the linguistic community where TGG had a favorable reception. Morris Halle, a student of Roman Jacobson and a colleague of Chomsky at MIT's Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE), was a strong supporter of Chomsky's ideas of TGG. At first Halle worked on a generative phonology of Russian and published his work in 1959.Halle 1959 From 1956 until 1968, together with Chomsky (and also with Fred Lukoff initially), Halle developed a new theory of phonology called generative phonology. Their collaboration culminated with the publication of The Sound Pattern of English in 1968. Robert Lees, a linguist of the traditional structuralist school, went to MIT in 1956 to work in the mechanical translation project at RLE, but became convinced by Chomsky's TGG approach and went on to publish, in 1960, probably the very first book of a linguistic analysis based on TGG entitled The Grammar of English Nominalizations. This work was preceded by Lees's doctoral thesis on the same topic, for which he was given a Ph.D. in electrical engineering. Lees was technically the first student of the new TGG paradigm. Edward S. Klima, a graduate of the Masters program from Harvard and hired by Chomsky at RLE in 1957, produced pioneering TGG-based work on negation.Klima 1964 In 1959, Chomsky wrote a critical review of B. F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior (1957) in the journal Language, in which he emphasized on the fundamentally human characteristic of verbal creativity, which is present even in very young children, and rejected the behaviorist way of describing language in ambiguous terms such as \\"stimulus,\\" \\"response,\\" \\"habit,\\" \\"conditioning,\\" and \\"reinforcement.\\" Chomsky 1959 With Morris Halle and others, Chomsky founded the graduate program in linguistics at MIT in 1961. The program immediately attracted some of the brightest young American linguists. Jerry Fodor and Jerrold Katz, both graduates of the Ph.D. program at Princeton, and Paul Postal, a Ph.D. from Yale, were some of the first students of this program. They made major contributions to the nascent field of TGG. John Viertel, a colleague of Chomsky at RLE in the 1950s, began working for a Ph.D. dissertation under Chomsky on the linguistic thoughts of Wilhelm von Humboldt, a nineteenth-century German linguist. Viertel's English translations of Humboldt's works influenced Chomsky at this time and made him abandon Saussurian views of linguistics.In Chomsky 1970:23, Chomsky writes that \\"Modern linguistics is much under the influence of Saussure's conception of langue as an inventory of elements and his preoccupation with systems of elements rather than the systems of rules which were the focus of attention in traditional grammar and in the general linguistics of Humboldt.\\" Chomsky also collaborated with visiting French mathematician Marcel-Paul Sch√ºtzenberger, and was able to formulate one of the most important theorems of formal linguistics, the Chomsky-Sch√ºtzenberger hierarchy. Within the theoretical framework of TGG, G. H. Matthews, Chomsky's colleague at RLE, worked on the grammar of Hidatsa, a Native American language. J. R. Applegate worked on the German noun phrase. Lees and Klima looked into English pronominalization. Matthews and Lees worked on the German verb phrase.Yngve 1956. On the nature of the linguistic research at MIT in those days, Jerry Fodor recalls that \\"...communication was very lively, and I guess we shared a general picture of the methodology for doing, not just linguistics, but behavioral science research. We were all more or less nativist, and all more or less mentalist. There was a lot of methodological conversation that one didn't need to have. One could get right to the substantive issues. So, from that point of view, it was extremely exciting.\\".Harris 1993: 68 In 1962, Chomsky gave a paper at the Ninth International Congress of Linguists entitled \\"The Logical Basis of Linguistic Theory,\\" in which he outlined the transformational generative grammar approach to linguistics. In June 1964, he delivered a series of lectures at the Linguistic Institute of the Linguistic Society of America (these were later published in 1966 as Topics in the Theory of Generative Grammar). All of these activities aided to develop what is now known as the \\"Standard Theory\\" of TGG, in which the basic formulations of Syntactic Structures underwent considerable revision. In 1965, eight years after the publication of Syntactic Structures, Chomsky published Aspects partly as an acknowledgment of this development and partly as a guide for future directions for the field. Overview of topics As British linguist Peter Hugoe Matthews noted in his reviewMatthews 1967 of the book, the content of Aspects can be divided into two distinct parts: Chapter 1 is concerned with the psychological reality of language and the philosophy of language research, and the rest of the chapters deal with specific technical details within generative grammar. The goal of linguistic theory Competence vs. performance: descriptive adequacy In Aspects, Chomsky lays down the abstract, idealized context in which a linguistic theorist is supposed to perform his research: \\"Linguistic theory is concerned primarily with an ideal speaker-listener, in a completely homogeneous speech-community, who knows its language perfectly and is unaffected by such grammatically irrelevant conditions as memory limitations, distractions, shifts of attention and interest, and errors (random or characteristic) in applying his knowledge of the language in actual performance.\\" He makes a \\"fundamental distinction between competence (the speaker-hearer's knowledge of his language) and performance (the actual use of language in concrete situation).\\" A \\"grammar of a language\\" is \\"a description of the ideal speaker-hearer's intrinsic competence\\", and this \\"underlying competence\\" is a \\"system of generative processes.\\" An \\"adequate grammar\\" should capture the basic regularities and the productive nature of a language. Chomsky calls this \\"descriptive adequacy\\" of the linguistic theory, in the sense that \\"it correctly describes its object, namely the linguistic intuition --the tacit competence--of the native speaker. In this sense, the grammar is justified on external grounds, on grounds of correspondence to linguistic fact.\\" Language acquisition, universal grammar and explanatory adequacy Additionally, Chomsky sets forth another ambitious goal for linguistic theory in Aspects: that it has to be \\"sufficiently rich to account for acquisition of language, yet not so rich as to be inconsistent with the known diversity of language.\\" In other words, linguistic theory must be able to describe how any normal human child masters the complexities of his mother tongue at such a young age, and how children all over the world master languages which are enormously different from one another in terms of vocabulary, word order and morpho-syntactic constructions. In Chomsky's opinion, in order for a linguistic theory to be justified on \\"internal grounds\\" and to achieve \\"explanatory adequacy\\", it has to show how a child's brain, when exposed to primary linguistic data, uses special innate abilities or strategies (described as a set of principles called \\"Universal Grammar\\") and selects the correct grammar of the language over many other grammars compatible with the same data. Grammaticality and acceptability For Chomsky, \\"grammaticalness is ... a matter of degree.\\" When sentences are directly generated by the system of grammatical rules, they are called \\"perfectly\\" or \\"strictly well-formed\\" grammatical sentences. When sentences are \\"derivatively generated\\" by \\"relaxing\\" some grammatical rules (such as \\"subcategorization rules\\" or \\"selectional rules\\"), they deviate from strictly well-formedness. Chomsky calls these grammatically \\"deviant\\". The degree and manner of their deviation can be evaluated by comparing their structural description with that of the strictly well-formed sentences. In this way, a theory of \\"degree of grammaticalness\\" can eventually be developed. According to Chomsky, an \\"acceptable\\" sentence is one that is \\"perfectly natural\\" and \\"immediately comprehensible\\" and \\"in no way bizarre or outlandish\\". The notion of acceptability depends on various \\"dimensions\\" such as \\"rapidity, correctness, and uniformity of recall and recognition, normalcy of intonation\\". Chomsky adds that \\"acceptability is a concept that belongs to the study of performance, whereas grammaticalness belongs to the study of competence.\\" So, there can be sentences that are grammatical but nevertheless unacceptable because of \\"memory limitations\\" or intonational and stylistic factors.\\" Emphasis on mentalism In Aspects Chomsky writes that \\"linguistic theory is mentalistic, since it is concerned with discovering a mental reality underlying actual behavior.\\" Chomsky 1965: 4 With this mentalist interpretation of linguistic theory, Chomsky elevated linguistics to a field that is part of a broader theory of human mind, i.e. the cognitive sciences. According to Chomsky, a human child's mind is equipped with a \\"language acquisition device\\" formed by inborn mental properties called \\"linguistic universals\\" which eventually constructs a mental theory of the child's mother tongue.Chomsky 1965: 33 The linguist's main object of inquiry, as Chomsky sees it, is this underlying psychological reality of language. Instead of making catalogs and summaries of linguistic behavioral data demonstrated on the surface (i.e. behaviorism), a Chomskyan linguist should be interested in using \\"introspective data\\" to ascertain the properties of a deeper mental system. The mentalist approach to linguistics proposed by Chomsky is also different from an investigation of the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying language. It is about abstractly determining the properties and functions of such mechanisms.Chomsky 1965: 193 The structure of grammar: deep structure The grammar model discussed in Noam Chomsky's Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (1965) In Aspects, Chomsky summarized his proposed structure of a grammar in the following way: \\"A grammar contains a syntactic component, a semantic component and a phonological component...The syntactic component consists of a base and a transformational component. The base, in turn, consists of a categorial subcomponent and a lexicon. The base generates deep structures. A deep structure enters the semantic component and receives a semantic interpretation; it is mapped by transformational rules into a surface structure, which is then given a phonetic interpretation by the rules of the phonological component.\\"Chomsky 1965: 141 In this grammar model, syntax is given a prominent, generative role, whereas phonology and semantics are assigned secondary, interpretive roles. This theory of grammar would later come to be known as the \\"Standard Theory\\" (ST). The base subcomponent The base in the syntactic component functions as follows: In the first step, a simple set of phrase structure rules generate tree diagrams (sometimes called Phrase Markers) consisting of nodes and branches, but with empty terminal nodes; these are called \\"pre-lexical structures\\". In the second step, the empty terminal nodes are filled with complex symbols consisting of morphemes accompanied by syntactic and semantic features, supplied from the lexicon via lexical insertion rules. The resulting tree diagram is called a \\"deep structure\\". Comparison with the Syntactic Structures model The Aspects model or ST differed from Syntactic Structures (1957) in a number of ways. Firstly, the notion of kernel sentences (a class of sentences produced by applying obligatory transformational rules) was abandoned and replaced by the notion of \\"deep structures\\", within which negative, interrogative markers, etc. are embedded. This simplified the generation of \\"surface\\" sentences, whereas in the previous model, a number of successive optional transformational rules had to be applied on the kernel sentences to arrive at the same result. Secondly, the addition of a semantic component to the grammar marked an important conceptual change since Syntactic Structures, where the role of meaning was effectively neglected and not considered part of the grammatical model.From Chomsky 1957:106 : \\"Grammar is best formulated as a self-contained study independent of semantics.\\" Chomsky mentions that the semantic component is essentially the same as described in Katz and Postal (1964). Among the more technical innovations are the use of recursive phrase structure rules and the introduction of syntactic features in lexical entries to address the issue of subcategorization. Syntactic features In Chapter 2 of Aspects, Chomsky discusses the problem of subcategorization of lexical categories and how this information should be captured in a generalized manner in the grammar. He deems that rewriting rules are not the appropriate device in this regard. As a solution, he borrows the idea of features use in phonology. A lexical category such as noun, verb, etc. is represented by a symbol such as N, V. etc. A set of \\"subcategorization rules\\" then analyzes these symbols into \\"complex symbols\\", each complex symbol being a set of specified \\"syntactic features\\", grammatical properties with binary values. Syntactic feature is one of the most important technical innovations of the Aspects model. Most contemporary grammatical theories have preserved it. Significance ;Linguistics UCLA linguist Tim Stowell considers Aspects to be \\"effectively the most important foundational document of the field\\" of transformational generative grammar (TGG), providing \\"the definitive exposition of the classical theory of TGG ‚Äî the so-called Standard Theory\\". University of Cambridge linguists Ian Roberts and Jeffrey Watumull maintain that Aspects ushered in the \\"Second Cognitive Revolution ‚Äî the revival of rationalist philosophy first expounded in the Enlightenment\\", in particular by Leibniz.Gallego and Ott 2015 : 211 ;Philosophy Moral philosopher John Rawls compared building a theory of morality to that of the generative grammar model found in Aspects. In A Theory of Justice (1971), he notes that just like Chomsky's grammar model assumes a set of finite underlying principles that are supposed to adequately explain the variety of sentences in linguistic performance, our sense of justice can be defined as a set of moral principles that give rise to everyday judgments.Rawls 1971:41-42 ;Medicine In his Nobel Prize lecture titled \\"The Generative Grammar of the Immune System\\", the 1984 Nobel Prize laureate in Medicine and Physiology Niels K. Jerne used Chomsky's generative grammar model in Aspects to explain the human immune system, comparing \\"the variable region of a given antibody molecule\\" to \\"a sentence\\". \\"The immense repertoire of the immune system then becomes ... a lexicon of sentences which is capable of responding to any sentence expressed by the multitude of antigens which the immune system may encounter.\\" Jerne called the DNA segments in chromosomes which encode the variable regions of antibody polypeptides a human's inheritable \\"deep structures\\", which can account for the innately complex yet miraculously effective fighting capacity of human antibodies against complex antigens. This is comparable to Chomsky's hypothesis that a child is born with innate language universals to acquire a complex human language in a very short time.Jerne 1985 ;Artificial intelligence Neuroscientist David Marr wrote that the goal of artificial intelligence is to find and solve information processing problems. First, one must build a computational theory of the problem (i.e. the abstract formulation of the \\"what\\" and \\"why\\" of the problem). And then one must construct an algorithm that implements it (i.e. the \\"how\\" of the problem). Marr likened the computational theory of an information processing problem to the notion of \\"competence\\" mentioned in Aspects. Criticism Several of the theoretical constructs and principles of the generative grammar introduced in Aspects such as deep structures, transformations, autonomy and primacy of syntax, etc. were either abandoned or substantially revised after they were shown to be either inadequate or too complicated to account for, in a simple and elegant way, many idiosyncratic example sentences from different languages.For example, in Smith and Wilson 1979: 122, it was argued that ‚Äúdeep structure can be abandoned, not because it is not deep enough to handle all the facts, but because it is deeper than is necessary.‚Äù As a response to these problems encountered within the Standard Theory, a new approach called the Generative semantics (as opposed to the interpretive semantics in Aspects) was invented in the early 1970s by some of Chomsky's collaborators (notably George LakoffIn Lakoff 1973, Lakoff writes that \\"[Generative Semanticists] have found that many of the most basic assumptions of transformational grammar were inadequate and have rejected them, including the following of Chomsky‚Äôs fundamental assumptions: that syntax is independent of human thought and reasoning, that there exists a syntactic deep structure, that transformational rules are fundamentally adequate for the study of grammar, that syntactic categories are independent of the categories of human thought, that language use plays no role in grammar, that syntax is independent of the social and cultural assumptions of speakers, and many other central positions of Chomsky‚Äôs that many of us find inadequate, especially in the light of recent research.\\"), and was incorporated later in the late 1980s into what is now known as the school of Cognitive linguistics, at odds with Chomskyan school of Generative linguistics. Chomsky himself addressed these issues at around the same time (early 1970s) and updated the model to an \\"Extended Standard Theory\\", where syntax was less autonomous, the interaction between the syntactic and the semantic component was much more interactive and the transformations were cyclical.Chomsky 1973 References Bibliography          External links * Google books preview of Aspects of the Theory of Syntax Category:Syntax books Category:Books by Noam Chomsky Category:1965 non-fiction books ","title":"Aspects of the Theory of Syntax"},{"id":"24400471","title":"Khufukhaf I"},{"id":"24400479","text":"William W.

Since the restoration of independence in 1991 there are no divisions currently among the Estonian Defence Forces. History On 16 November 1918, the Estonian Provisional Government made the decision to create an armed force of volunteers. It was decided that army would consist of a single division which would have six infantry regiments, one cavalry regiment, one artillery regiment, and one engineering battalion.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, page 58. Olion, 1992, Major General Aleksander T√µnisson was assigned commander of the division, with Colonel Jaan Rink as chief of staff. However, when the Estonian War of Independence started on 28 November 1918 with the Soviet attack on Narva, the Estonian Army numbered only 2,200 to 2,300 men, with the bulk of the fighting actually conducted by the paramilitary Defence League. Soviet forces included the 6th Red Rifle Division at Narva and the 2nd Novgorod Division south of Lake Peipus. After losing at Narva a period of retreat began for the 1st Division. Advancing against weak Estonian defences the Red Army captured Valga on 18 December, Tartu on 22 December, and Tapa on 24 December. In order to conduct a more flexible defence of South Estonia, a separate 2nd Division was formed on 24 December under command of Colonel Viktor Puskar. By the end of the year the Soviets had advanced to within of the capital, Tallinn. By the beginning of 1919 the Estonian Army had been increased to 13,000 men, with 5,700 on the front facing 8,000 Soviets.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, page 10. Olion, 1992, The strengthened Estonian Army stopped the 7th Red Army's advance on 2‚Äì5 January 1919, and went on the counter-offensive on 7 January. Tapa was liberated two days later with the support of armoured trains, followed by Rakvere on 12 January. With the aim of capturing Narva, a 1,000 strong Finnish-Estonian force was landed at Utria on 17 January, in the rear of the 6th Rifle Division, cutting off the Soviet forces west of them. On 18 January Narva was liberated. Subsequently, the north eastern front stabilized along the Narva river. Over the course of 11 days the 1st Division had advanced .Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, page 98. Olion, 1992, After repulsing the Soviet forces in North Estonia the 1st Division was involved in active combat near Narva. During spring the Red Army made several unsuccessful attacks against 1st Division positions. By April 11,000 Estonians of the 1st Division were facing 16,000 Soviets near Narva, during which the main Soviet effort was concentrated in South Estonia.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, page 11. Olion, 1992, After the White Russian Northern Corps' (later renamed to Northwest Army) offensive against Soviet forces began to fail in June at the hands of the 7th Red Army, the front was stabilized on Luga River and Saba River with support of the 1st Division. In July and August the 1st Division was involved in heavy fighting with Soviet forces in that area. At the end of September 1919, the Northwest Army had initiated a new attack on Petrograd, but was repelled by the Red Army in November. The 7th and 15th Soviet Armies advancing behind the collapsing White Russian forces continued to attack fortified positions along the Estonian border near Narva. The first clashes took place on the Luga River on 16 November, starting the final battles of war with 120,000 Soviets facing just 40,000 Estonians.Kaevats, √úlo: Eesti Ents√ºklopeedia 10, page 123. Eesti Ents√ºklopeediakirjastus, 1998, After repeated attacks on the fortified Estonian positions, the 7th Red Army managed to achieve limited success. At the end of November the situation on front calmed as the Soviets needed to replenish their forces. In order to exert pressure on Estonia in the peace talks, intensive Soviet attacks resumed on 7 December.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, page 200. Olion, 1992, On 16 December there was critical breakthrough, with the 15th Soviet Army crossing the Narva River, however the Estonian counter-attack the following day successfully pushed the Soviets back. The Estonian high command actively reinforced the 1st Division at Narva during the fighting, dispatching the 3rd Division command, while general T√µnisson became commander of whole Viru Front. He was replaced as 1st Division commander by Colonel Otto Heinze. After suffering 35,000 casualties in the heavy battles, the Red Army was completely exhausted by the end of December. A ceasefire came into effect on 3 January 1920.Georg von Rauch, The Baltic States: The Years of Independence 1917-1940, Hurst & Co, 1974, p70 Post war 1st Division staff was based in Rakvere.

The 1801-1803 Atwater complex is also known as the Globe Trading Company Building, and in 2015 was opened by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources as the Outdoor Adventure Center. The complex is significant as a historic maritime manufacturing facility.Thomas A. Klug, Historic American Engineering Record: Dry Dock Engine Works, HAER no. MI-330, 2002, p. 1 The earliest structure, an 1892 machine shop, is also significant as an early example of an industrial building entirely supported by its steel frame, but using traditional brick and standard windows to infill the curtain walls. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. In 2012, the Department of Natural Resources received funding for historic redevelopment of the complex, along the city's east riverfront promenade.  History  The Dry Dock Engine Works-Detroit Dry Dock Company Complex includes pieces of two once-independent companies‚Äîthe Dry Dock Engine Works and the Detroit Dry Dock Company‚Äîwhich merged in 1899.  Detroit Dry Dock Company  Detroit Dry Dock yard and, in background, Dry Dock Engine Works buildings (including the Dry Dock Hotel in center), c. 1884. None of the structures in this engraving survive. In the 1840s, Captain Stephen R. Kirby began a shipbuilding firm in Cleveland, Ohio, and by 1852 had moved to Saginaw, Michigan.Detroit Dry Dock Company/Globe Trading Building from Detroit1701.org, retrieved 9/16/09 In 1870, Kirby's son Frank, a Cooper Union- trained engineer, joined the firm as lead designer. (Frank Kirby went on to a successful shipbuilding career, which included the design of two National Historic Landmarks: the Columbia and the Ste. Claire.) In 1872,Klug, p.13 the Kirby's firm purchased a shipyard in Wyandotte, Michigan. In 1852, Campbell, Wolverton and Company opened a ship repair yard on the Detroit River at the foot of Orleans Street.Klug, p. 5 In 1860 the firm, now known (with the addition of John Owen as president) as Campbell & Owen, constructed a 260' dry dock in the same location. They constructed their first steamship in 1867. In 1877, Campbell & Owen reorganized, changing its name to the Detroit Dry Dock Company. At about the same time, Detroit Dry Dock purchased the Kirby's Wyandotte shipbuilding firm. Also in the late 1870s, railroad and shipping magnate James McMillan became interested in shipbuilding, purchasing shares in Detroit Dry Dock. By 1890, McMillan was president of the company, and by 1892 was also president of the nearby Dry Dock Engine Works.  Dry Dock Engine Works  James McMillan Dry Dock Engine Works, a marine engine manufacturer, was formed in 1866 by William Cowie, Edward Jones, and Robert Donaldson, with Cowie as president.Klug, p. 7 The firm set up shop on Atwater, between Orleans and Dequindre, across from the dry dock firm that was then called Campbell & Owen. The firm slowly acquired surrounding lots, and by 1880 owned nearly the entire city block back to Guoin Street.Klug, p. 8 (The city vacated Dequindre in the vicinity of the Dry Dock Engine Works in 1917,Klug, p. 43 and Guoin some time later; neither street currently exists in the area.) The main product line of the Dry Dock Engine Works was marine engines, and they produced 129 engines between 1867 and 1894.Klug, p. 11 However, the firm also produced stationary and portable steam engines, as well as mining equipment, mill gearing, and brass and iron casting. In 1883, Dry Dock Engine Works bought the nearby boiler shop of Desotell & Hudson, expanding their product line.Klug, p. 8 Although unimportant at the time, the Dry Dock Engine Works is significant as an early employer of Henry Ford. The future automobile magnate worked at the firm between 1880 and 1882 as an apprentice machinist.Klug, p. 16 His work with steam engines at the Dry Dock Engine Works inspired in part Ford's later idea of adding an engine to a carriage for road use. The Dry Dock Engine Works had always had a special relationship with the nearby Detroit Dry Dock Company, which only increased as the years passed. In the 1870s, Dry Dock Engine Works sold over 1/3 of their engines to Detroit Dry Dock; by the early 1890s that fraction had increased to nearly 2/3. The ties were enhanced by the fact that Frank Kirby, John Owen, and James McMillan of Detroit Dry Dock slowly acquired shares in Dry Dock Engine Works. By the end of the 1880s, virtually all of the Dry Dock Engine Works shares were owned by Detroit Dry Dock principals.Klug, p. 14 In 1892, James McMillan took over the presidency of Dry Dock Engine Works, and the two firms were controlled by the same person. It was around this time that the oldest of the remaining structures in the complex, the machine shop and dry dock no. 2, were built.  Integration: Detroit Shipbuilding Company  Diagram of Detroit Dry Dock, 1894 (North is to the left). The only remaining structures are the machine shop and Dry Dock #2 Five of six buildings of the Engine Works complex are visible in this image; from left to right: the end of the industrial loft, the foundry, chipping room, end of the machine shop addition, and the end of the machine shop. Although even after 1892 the two firms were technically separate, they essentially operated as a single business unit, with the same principals in charge of both. In 1899, this relationship became more formal, as the Dry Dock Engine Works, the Detroit Dry Dock Company, and the Detroit Sheet Metal and Brass Works were combined to form the Detroit Shipbuilding Company, which itself was a subsidiary of the American Shipbuilding Company headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio.Klug, p. 15 The integration of these operating units created a substantial company: in 1900, the Detroit Shipbuilding Company employed 1337 people, and was the fourth-largest employer in Detroit.Klug, p. 16 A few years later, in 1902, the Detroit Shipbuilding Company built two more still- surviving structures, the foundry and the industrial loft building. Sometime in the 1910s, three more structures were built, which completed the enclosure of the block where the original Dry Dock Engine Company was founded, and represent the latest of the surviving buildings of the complex. Shipbuilding continued at the facilities in Wyandotte and Detroit through the 1920s, with a substantial number of ships constructed in the World War I years of 1917-1919.Klug, p. 20 However, business soon decreased and in 1920 the yard in Wyandotte was closed as a cost-cutting measure. Not long afterward, in 1924, a pair of steamers were fitted up in the Detroit yards; these two proved to be the last vessels constructed in Detroit by the American Shipbuilding Company.Klug, p. 21 The Detroit Shipbuilding Company completely ceased operations in 1929.  Use post-maritime construction  The property owned by the Detroit Shipbuilding Company at Atwood and Orleans passed through several hands, being used by a cabinet shop and a stove manufacturer in the early 1930s. In 1935, the property was acquired by the Detroit Edison Company. It is unclear what use, if any, Detroit Edison put the property to in the 1930s and 40s, but in the 1950s and 60s Edison used the engine-building plant as a reconditioning and appliance shop. By 1968, the property was occupied by the Globe Trading Company, a machinery and mill supplies dealer. In 1981, Edison sold the property to Globe. At some time later, the property was abandoned, and by 2002 was empty and owned by the city of Detroit.  Redevelopment  In 2006, a $15-million redevelopment plan was announced, with 45 condominiums and of ground floor retail space.John Gallagher, \\"RIVERFRONT DEVELOPMENT: Back in the building: Historic structure to become living space.\\" Detroit Free Press, October 20, 2006.

This development involved demolition of portions of the historic building complex. The center opened in 2015.

Klug, Historic American Engineering Record: Dry Dock Engine Works, HAER no. MI-330, 2002 Dry dock no. 2, looking toward the river, 2009. The Dry Dock Engine Works began manufacturing engines on Atwater Street in 1867; however, the earliest buildings used by the company were replaced by later buildings, built between 1892 and 1919.Klug, p. 22 These early structures were located throughout the city block owned by the company, and included a sheet metal works, boiler shop, forge, machine shop, and the Dry Dock Hotel. The Detroit Dry Dock Company began shipbuilding in the same area as early as 1852. Their earlier dry docks, including Dry Dock No. 1, no longer exist. A complex of six buildings, as well as Dry Dock No. 2, do remain.  Detroit Dry Dock Co. Dry Dock No. 2 (1892)  In 1892, the Detroit Dry Dock Company constructed a new dry dock near the foot of Orleans Street, just west of their original dry dock facility.Klug, p. 24 Dry Dock No. 2 was long, deep below the water line, with a width of between (at the top) and (at the bottom). Over two thousand piles were driven into the ground to support the dock.Detroit Dry Dock Company, Around the Lakes: Containing a Full List of American Lake Vessels, and Addresses of Managing Owners, Condensed Statistics of the Lake Business, and a Historical Resume and Illustrations of the Plant, and Vessels Built by the Detroit Dry Dock Company, Detroit, Mich. ship and Engine Builders, Marine Review Print., Cleveland, 1894, p. 115. As constructed, the dock could be flooded in twenty minutes and pumped dry in about ninety minutes. The dock was sized to be able to accommodate any vessel traveling on the Great Lakes at that time, and could house even fully loaded vessels. A monument with sculpture depicting the Dry Dock and the steamer Pioneer is located at the north end of the dry dock.

Also in 1892, Detroit Dry Dock built a machine shop at the corner of Atwater and Orleans, running parallel to Orleans. The shop replaced a portion of the earlier machine shop which fronted on Atwater. The building was designed and built by Berlin Iron Bridge Company, a firm from Connecticut now part of the American Bridge Company. The building featured a load-bearing steel frame and non-load-bearing brick curtain walls, at the time a novel construction technique. Also in 1892, Berlin Iron Bridge also built a boiler shop of the same construction across Dequindre from the main complex; this building has since been demolished.  Description  The machine shop is long, wide, and tall to the top of the wall; a roof monitor extends the height an additional . The building consists of thirteen bays dividing the length into , with the northernmost bay a full wider. Internally, the shop is separated by columns into a running the length of the building on the west side, and a on the east side. Pediment walls at each end of the building rise above the roof and are capped with limestone.Klug, p. 36 Two windows per bay were included along the west side.Klug, p. 37 The original windows were replaced sometime between 1912 and 1932. The building originally had two large doorways on the west side; these have since been bricked in.Klug, p. 33 The roof is supported by a series of trusses spaced at nearly .Klug, p. 35 A runs most of the length of the roof. Although now covered with sheet metal, the sides and roof of the monitor were originally glass.Klug, p. 36  Background  The 1892 machine shop was constructed to take advantage of what was at the time the most modern innovations applied to manufacturing buildings: electric drive machinery and an electrically driven traveling overhead crane.Klug, p. 26 The tall, wide construction of the building, containing an open space lacking support columns, reflects the desire to implement the crane into the company's manufacturing process. In fact, contemporaneous material from the Detroit Dry Dock Company extols the virtues of the open plan of the building, the \\"great advantages of light and air\\" afforded by the skylight and windows, and the effectiveness of the crane.Around the Lakes p. 86. The open space in the building was possible due to the construction of the building in what was at the time a novel method. Steel frame construction had emerged in 1880s Chicago in the construction of office buildings, the first being the nine-story Home Insurance Building, constructed in 1884.Klug, p. 27 However, the first building to be completely supported by a riveted all-steel frame was the 1889 Rand McNally Building. The steel frame allowed the exterior walls to be reduced to a simple curtain covering the frame, rather than supporting the weight of the building. The Berlin Iron Bridge Company, already experienced in riveted steel construction through their bridge construction, moved into the design and construction of steel-framed industrial buildings at some time in the late 1880s.Klug, p. 30  Significance  The machine shop is an early example of an industrial building which was entirely supported by a rigid structural steel frame, with exterior walls that were merely a curtain around the structure.Klug, p. 49 This building may very well have been the first such structure in Detroit.Klug, p. 49 The particular design used by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company represented a conservative, hybrid design.Betsy H. Bradley, The works: the industrial architecture of the United States, 1999, Oxford University Press, p. 149-150 The steel frame completely supported the structure, but the non-load-bearing curtain walls were nonetheless designed the same way as traditional brick load-bearing walls. The windows in the infill were standard-sized windows arranged in a traditional two per bay, side-by-side configuration. The construction gave the Dry Dock Engine Works the advantages of the open interior space provided by the steel frame construction combined with the more substantial, traditional appearance afforded by the brick exterior.Klug, p. 37 In addition, the brick gave some protection from cold during winter months, with enough windows to maximize the interior light. This particular building exemplifies a link between the traditional past style of industrial architecture and the revolutionary change represented by steel framing. Eric J. Hill and John Gallagher, in their American Institute of Architects guide to Detroit architecture, state that this building is perhaps \\"the most important surviving nineteenth-century industrial building in Detroit.\\"Eric J.

The Industrial Loft Building ran along Atwater from the east side of the machine shop to what was then Dequindre.Klug, p. 40 The loft building fronted on Atwood, stretching from the machine shop to Dequindre; the foundry faced Dequindre north of the loft building, completing the enclosure of the entire city block from Atwood to Guoin and Orleans to Dequindre.  Foundry  Foundry building from the northeast, 2009. The foundry is long and wide, and stands high to the top of the wall; a roof monitor adds another to the height. The building is divided into seven .Klug, p. 40 Clerestory windows run the length of the building. The interior is sectioned into a main section and a . Like the machine shop, the foundry is constructed with a load-bearing steel frame sheathed with non-load- bearing brick. The interior bays ran the full height of the building to make room for an overhead crane. The foundry building operated as a foundry for only a little over a decade. Sometime in the 1910s, the company built a new foundry and this building was converted into an erecting shop. At some time afterward, possibly as late as the 1950s, the southernmost bay of the building was turned into a loading dock with the addition of an interior concrete block wall. Balconies above the dock were constructed, likely for storage.  Industrial Loft Building  Industrial Loft Building At the same time as the foundry was constructed, the Detroit Shipbuilding Company also built a three- story loft building. The loft building fronted on Atwater Street, and was long, wide, and high to the top of the roof pediment.Klug, p. 44 The building was originally occupied by a blacksmith's shop, bolt-cutter, and office space on the first floor, a pattern shop and tool room on the second floor, and engineering offices and storage on the third floor. In addition, two narrow drives passed through the first floor to an interior courtyard. These drives were later bricked in.Klug, p. 46 Other alterations of the facade over time include bricking in of windows on the east side and the addition of doors on the south side. Like the machine shop and foundry, the loft building had a steel-framed structure with brick curtain walls.Klug, p. 45 The framing supported the loads on the floors as well as the weight of the roof. The steel framing, however, was wholly contained within the building rather than being encased in the brick. File:Dry Dock Engine Works Foundry interior 2002.jpg|Interior of foundry, 2002.

Machine shop addition, chipping room, and shipping/receiving (c. 1910s)  The chipping room (left center) and machine shop addition (right center) between the foundry (far left) and machine shop (far right). The roof monitor of the shipping/receiving building is just visible at top left center. Sometime between 1910 and 1919, three more structures were built, enclosing the yard between the 1892 machine shop and the 1902 foundry.  Machine shop addition  The machine shop addition is a steel-framed structure long, wide, and high to the roof trusses. A roof monitor extended the height another . It was built along the east side of the 1892 machine shop; the brick in-fill of the machine shop was removed to provide a continuous inner area. The north wall of the structure had a large steel-framed window wall, although the lower portion of it is now bricked in. The interior of the addition was originally a wide, open space with an overhead crane similar to the one in the original machine shop.Klug, p. 47 However, some time after 1922 a wooden floor was constructed within the building to provide a second story on top of a first-floor bay.  Chipping room  Some time later, a chipping room was built along the north end of the block between the machine shop addition and the foundry building, displacing remnants of earlier buildings in the same place. The chipping room was where surface imperfections of castings were removed. This structure is also steel-framed, sharing its columns with adjacent buildings on the east and west. The building is long and wide, and was built in two sections separated by a masonry wall.Klug, p. 48 Much of the north side was originally steel- framed windows; these have since been covered with blocks.  Shipping/receiving  In 1918, the company constructed a shipping/receiving building in the center of the complex, within what was previously an interior courtyard. This structure is a two-story steel-framed building measuring 5 by 72 feet (1.5 m √ó 22 m). The first floor was originally a shipping/receiving area, with access to Atwater via the drives running through the industrial loft building. The second floor functioned as a stockroom. A roof monitor provided light for the second floor, but the completely encased first floor required artificial lighting.

(2006). The Land of Scholars, p. 172. Taejo of Joseon established the \\"Kingdom of Great Joseon\\" in 1392-1393, and he founded the Joseon Dynasty which would retain power on the Korean peninsula for five hundred years. As an initial step, a diplomatic mission was dispatched to China and to Japan in 1402. Subsequent missions developed and nurtured the contacts and exchanges between these neighboring countries. A diplomatic mission conventionally consisted of three envoys‚Äîthe main envoy, the vice-envoy, and a document official. Also included were one or more official writers or recorders who created a detailed account of the mission.Walraven, Boudewign et al. (2007). Korea in the middle: Korean studies and area studies, p. 362. In the 20th century, the Joseon Dynasty's bilateral relations were affected by the increasing numbers of international contacts which required adaptation and a new kind of diplomacy.Kang, Woong Joe. (2005). Struggle for Identity, pp. 38-78. Diplomacy with China Although the Joseon Dynasty considered 1392 as the foundation of the Joseon kingdom, Imperial China did not immediately acknowledge the new government on the Korean peninsula. In 1401, the Ming court recognized Joseon as a tributary state in its sino-centric schema of foreign relations. In 1403, the Yongle Emperor conveyed a patent and a gold seal to Taejong of Joseon, thus confirming his status and that of his dynasty.Kang, Etsuko H. (1997). Diplomacy and Ideology in Japanese-Korean Relations: from the Fifteenth to the Eighteenth Century, p. 49. An early achievement of the new monarch was improved relations with China; Joseon had its origin in General Yi's refusal to attack China in response to raids from Chinese bandits.Hussain, Tariq. (2006). Diamond Dilemma: Shaping Korea for the 21st Century, p. 45; Hodge, Carl Cavanagh. (2008). Encyclopedia of the Age of Imperialism, 1800‚Äì1914: A-K, p. 401. Diplomacy with Japan As an initial step, a diplomatic mission was dispatched to Japan in 1402. The Joseon envoy sought to bring about the re-establishment of amicable relations between the two countries and he was charged to commemorate the good relations which existed in ancient times. This mission was successful, and sh≈çgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu was reported to have been favorably impressed by this initial embassy.Titsingh, p. 320. Not less than 70 diplomatic missions were dispatched from the Joseon capital to Japan before the beginning of Japan's Edo period.Lewis, James Bryant. Frontier contact between chos≈èn Korea and Tokugawa Japan, p. 269 n. 89, citing Hanguk Chungse tae-il kys≈çpsa y≈èngu (1996) by Na Chongpu. Reciprocal missions were construed as a means of communication between Korean kings and Japanese sh≈çguns of almost equal ranking. The emperors of Japan at the time were figureheads with no actual political or military power and the actual political and military rulers of Japan that Joseon communicated with were the shoguns who were represented as \\"tycoon of Japan\\" in many foreign communications in order to avoid the conflict with the Sinocentric world order in which the emperor of China was the highest authority, and all rulers of tributary states were known as \\"kings\\".Kang, Diplomacy and Ideology, p. 206. Gyorin diplomacy with other nations The Joseon dynasty employed the gyorin (kyorin) (neighborly relations) diplomacy in dealings with Jurchen, Japan, Ryukyu Kingdom, Siam and Java.Chun-gil Kim The History of Korea, pp. 76-77. 7 Gyorin was applied to a multi-national foreign policy.

Life The eldest son of Sir Christopher Yelverton and his wife Margaret Catesby, Henry Yelverton was born on 29 June 1566, most likely at Easton-Mauduit, his father's house in Northamptonshire. He became a barrister on 25 April 1593 and an ancient on 25 May of the same year. He was reader in 1607. In 1597, 1604 and 1614 Yelverton was elected to Parliament for the borough of Northampton. On 30 March 1604, when Sir Francis Goodwin's case was before the house, he argued for allowing Goodwin to take his seat in the teeth of the support given by the king to his rejection by chancery. On 5 April, when James had issued his orders, Yelverton was frightened, and argued that the prince's command was like a thunderbolt or the roaring of a lion. In the session of 1606‚Äì7 he was again in trouble, attacking George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar, the king's Scottish favourite, and generally criticising the bills brought in for effecting a partial union with Scotland, while he fell under Francis Bacon's suspicion as having had a hand in a book published by the puritan lawyer Nicholas Fuller. On the other hand, he did not argue against the king's wishes in Calvin's Case, and before the session of 1610 he sought an interview with Dunbar, and ultimately was admitted by the king to an audience, in which he explained away the words that had given offence. On 23 June 1610 he asserted that the law of England extended only to the low-water mark, and the king might therefore restrain all goods at sea from approaching the shore, and therefore only allow their being landed on payment of a duty. In 1613 Bacon spoke of Yelverton as having been won to the side of the Crown, and on 28 October of the same year he succeeded Bacon as solicitor-general. He was knighted on 8 November, perhaps through the good word of the king's favourite, Rochester, shortly afterwards Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset. In 1614 Yelverton again took his seat as member for Northampton in the Addled parliament. On 19 January 1615 he took an official part in the examination of Edmond Peacham under torture. About the same time he joined in signing a certificate in favour of the chancery in the conflict with Sir Edward Coke on the question of praemunire. On Bacon's acceptance of the great seal, in 1617, James announced that Yelverton should succeed him as attorney-general. For some time, however, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham obstructed him as a creature of the Howard family. Yelverton refused to apply to Buckingham, who sent for him; Yelverton expressed a hope that Buckingham would have no reason to complain of him, and had the warrant duly signed. In the dispute between Coke and Buckingham about the marriage of the daughter of the former, Yelverton acted the part of mediator, and it was to his charge that Frances Coke was committed. Later on he gave confidential information to Bacon on the feeling of Buckingham towards him, and pleaded the lord-keeper's cause at court with success. He lost his position as attorney-general for his handling of an attack on monopolies. In April 1617 he was employed, at Buckingham's instance, in taking legal proceedings against the opponents of the patent for gold and silver thread; but he refused to take the step of committing those persons to prison without first consulting the king. In 1618, however, he concurred with Bacon and Montague in advising that the infringers of the patent should be prosecuted in the Star-chamber. Becoming himself one of the commissioners on 22 April 1618, he was subsequently placed on another commission issued on 20 October authorising means to be taken for the punishment of offenders, and in 1619, the silkmen having refused to give a bond to abstain from the manufacture, he committed some of them to the Fleet prison; but, being unwilling to bear the responsibility, announced his intention of releasing them unless Bacon would support him. On 16 June 1620 Bacon and others recommended that, in spite of Yelverton's acknowledgment of error, he should be tried in the Star-chamber on the ground of having officially passed a charter to the city of London containing unauthorised provisions, and on 27 June he was suspended from his office. On 27 October Yelverton more expressly acknowledged his offence in the Star-chamber; but this was again held insufficient, and on 10 November he was sentenced to imprisonment in the Tower of London during pleasure, fined, and dismissed from his place if the king approved. The king appointed Yelverton's successor in the attorney-generalship on 11 January 1621. If Yelverton gave offence to the court by his hesitation in defending the monopolies, he also gave offence to those who attacked the monopolies by defending them at all. On 18 April 1621 he was fetched from the Tower to answer charges brought against him in the House of Lords, where he stated in the course of his defence that his sufferings were, in his opinion, due to circumstances connected with the patent for inns. At this James took offence, and on the 24th invited the peers to defend him against Yelverton's insinuations. On the 30th Yelverton, being called for his defence, turned fiercely upon Buckingham, charging him with using his influence with the king against him. On 16 May, the lords sentenced Yelverton to imprisonment, to make his submission to the king and Buckingham, and to pay to Buckingham five thousand marks, as well as ten thousand to the king. Buckingham at once refused to accept the money, while James was content with this vindication of himself and his favourite. Yelverton was accordingly set at liberty in July. On 10 May 1625, soon after Charles I's accession, he was promoted to the bench as a fifth judge of the court of common pleas. In this post he remained till his death on 24 January 1630. He was buried at Easton-Mauduit. Yelverton married Mary, daughter of Robert Beale. His son and heir, Christopher, was knighted in 1623, was created a baronet in 1641, and died on 4 December 1654.

UBSCR is associated with the University of Bristol and is affiliated to Bristol SU. UBSCR was established in 1943 and has rung bells at St Michael on the Mount Without since 1944. Since 1950 there have been over 700 peals rung for the society. UBSCR is also affiliated to the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers and sends two representatives to its AGM. History UBSCR was founded in the Autumn Term of 1943 by Monica Richardson. Since then generations of student ringers have come and gone, contributing on the way to the development of the Society and its traditions. The Society's first practice was held on 6 November 1943 at Long Ashton. In 1944 UBSCR moved to St Michael on the Mount, Without. The Society‚Äôs first peal (5040 of Grandsire Triples) was rung on 17 May 1947. Since then UBSCR has grown. Students and former students from the Bristol area are active members. The society home tower was St Michael on the mount, without from 1944 until 2012 when safety concerns limited the amount of ringing at St Michaels. The home tower is now St Matthews, Kingsdown. Ringing continued, albeit sporadically, at St Michaels until October 2016 when the church suffered a major fire. Activities UBSCR holds and participates in many events throughout the course of each academic year, including the meetings of the Southern Universities Association and the Northern Universities Association, a Summer Tour, Cupid Tour (organised by the current master) and a Christmas Party, as well as a cheese and port evening and pudding party. The Annual Dinner is held on the 4th Saturday of January each year and is celebrated with the ringing of peals. The University Centenary In 2009 the University of Bristol celebrated the centenary of being granted its Royal Charter. In celebration, Great George was rung for two minutes, and the bells of Bristol 'followed' Great George by ringing quarter peals and general change ringing. The UBSCR played a part in the celebrations of this event by ringing Great George and by helping with the other ringing.  Great George  The hour bell in the Wills Memorial Building is rung, by members and friends of UBSCR to mark events and days of national importance or significance . Examples of this include Queen Elizabeth II's 90th birthday and VE day.

The society is the seventh oldest golf club in the world. Its oldest course, Balcomie, was formally laid out by Old Tom Morris in 1894, but competitions were played there since the 1850s. The courses are north east of the fishing town of Crail, and the land upon which golf is played straddles the easternmost promontory of Fife, known as Fife Ness. The East Coast of Fife is particularly dense in links courses and is popular for golf tourism. Crail is south of St Andrews and from Kingsbarns. To the south west are the links of Elie, Anstruther, Lundin and Leven. Within an hour to the north are Scotscraig, Carnoustie, Monifieth and Panmure. Crail Golfing Society owns and operates two courses, Balcomie and Craighead, which differ in character. Balcomie, designed by Old Tom Morris in 1895, is a traditional links, retaining original holes, and a diverse and distinctive set of Par 3s. The 14th is the most photographed hole, a Par 3 with an elevated tee high above the beach dropping down to a heavily bunkered green. Longer holes, such as the 4th and 5th, feature doglegs around the sea edge. From Balcomie, on the north of the promontory, can be seen the mountain Lochnagar in the Balmoral estate, in addition to the Tay estuary, and much of eastern Scotland. Craighead, designed by American architect Gil Hanse is longer, a modern links, with rolling greens, native walls and wildlife typical of the Fife coast. The two links are on north and south edges of Fifeness, respectively, and have different views. Craighead allows views to the Forth Estuary and beyond, with the Bass Rock, Edinburgh and St Abbs Head visible away, and borders a nature reserve.

Classical education model The school uses the classical education model,Minion, P., Bauer, S. W., & Minion, W. (n.d.). The Well-Trained Mind - Homeschooling Curriculum. Retrieved March 09, 2017, from https://welltrainedmind.com/ which is a similar method to what the Greeks or Romans used. Students go through three stages of education cycles known as the \\"Grammar, Dialectic and Rhetoric stages\\". In the first stage, children learn the basics of language, mathematics, and discourse, along with the fundamentals of science. In the second stage, the knowledge from stage 1 is pieced together as students ask \\"why\\" and \\"how\\". Students begin to understand what they memorized in the Grammar stage. They can begin to form ideas of their own while being taught to properly formulate them with the study of logic. In the final stage, young adults can form their own opinions based on fact and reason. They can analyze sources, interpret them, and have meaningful discussions with each other. They often enjoy friendly but firmly grounded debates. Students learn Latin. They are taught science, language arts, humanities and a special subject called Character, in which they discuss \\"character traits\\", and the moral characters of those in history and apply them to their own lives. As the year progresses, high schoolers teach a class on a given week. They focus on a certain character trait per month, such as attentiveness. ACE tailors academia to each student individually. Students can go down or up to less rigorous or more challenging classes if it best helps their learning, and are placed in classes based on skill level rather than age. ACE offers excellent AP classes that prepare students well for the tests. Students have been shown to understand more intellectual processes, have a better knowledge of science, history, logic and government (both U.S. and foreign nations) than non-ACE students they interact with. For the 2018-2019 school year ace offers/ed 5 AP classes. The teachers according to the students exceed in aiding the students by helping them individually and as a group.https://www.greatschools.org/oregon/cottage-grove/3068-Academy-For- Character-Education/ Students also receive individual aid in their mathematics once a week via a tutor.http://www.aceclassicaled.org/ Academics In 2008-2017, 100% of the school's seniors received a high school diploma. Of 11 seniors, 11 graduated from ACE. For the 2016-2017 school year 80% if high school students received a 3.5 GPA or higher with some exceeding a 4.0., thus receiving a Presidential Award with the sitting president's signature printed on it. There are 9 classes for 12 grades. ACE is a public/homeschool hybrid, in which there are avg six SCD days a month. Students attend school on Tuesdays and Thursdays, following normal school hours, and get every fourth week off. (three weeks of SCDs, one week of break), as well as normal breaks for things like holidays, and spring, summer, fall, and winter break. Students are required to complete a good 4.5 weeks' worth of homework in 3 weeks expectantly increasing in the AP classes, but get the privilege of having the 4th week off. They also have four-year education cycles for history and science (e.g., biology, chemistry, physics, and geology). If effort is put into this experience, students should be well on track for college.  Activities  ACE meets only six mandatory times a month, but students can use the SIF (student instructional funds) they receive, if their work is up to par, to do extra-curricular activities during their week studying at home. They attend field trips throughout the year as a whole school. Trips are education and strive to best supplement the current history/science rotation they are studying. Examples are the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, OMSI, civil war reenactments, boat trips and even trips to Washington DC, Grece, or London. in which fundraising, SIF funds and additional out of pocket funds are used by the students to experience.  History ACE started as a simple homeschooling support group for families by Ranell Curl, and her daughter, Star Sahnow, in Oakridge, Oregon, known as the Home Scholars Academy. In 2007, ACE became an official school, and moved to Cottage Grove.  Classes * Character- Analyze the moral character of those in present and past history or in novels, also assessment of one's own character. * Science - Learn biology, chemistry, physics, or earth science and astronomy depending on year. Labs are done every month or more often. * Language-Arts - Learn to read and write (five paragraph essay model) including poetry and spelling and cursive practice and literature discussions in class. * Humanities - Study ancient, medieval renaissance and US history depending on year, also logic and reasoning. Econ and music and art history are studied too. * Latin - Latin grammar vocabulary and translation is learned. In 2017, middle school ACE students won the Latin Olympika competition.

It is a brown brick building dating to 1936. New York's state architect at that time, William Haugaard, used the Art Deco architectural style for the exterior of the building and the Tudorbethan mode for the interior. The armory remains virtually intact today. It was home to two units of the New York Army National Guard until it was closed in 2008. In 1995 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Building The armory is on a one-way extension of Washington Avenue just north of its interchange with Interstate 890 and just south of Schenectady County Community College's Elston Hall opposite, the former Hotel Van Curler. To its east is Fuller Street and some industrial buildings. Exterior It is on a lot with one other building, a modern garage not considered a contributing resource to the Register listing. The armory itself is a T-shaped building of brick on a steel frame structural system. The main block is three and a half stories in height with slightly asymmetrical two-story side wings. It has a projecting entrance pavilion on the west (front) elevation, with a segmented arch over its sally port, filled with two heavy oak doors with medieval-inspired hardware. The facade is otherwise embellished with details representing both the Art Deco and Tudorbethan styles. Projecting perpendicularly to the main administration building on the east is the drill shed, a gable-roofed wing with its windows spaced by buttresses with stone caps. The brick-faced concrete block garage is to the southeast. Interior The main entrance vestibule is a two-story octagonal space with concrete wainscoting painted to look like red sandstone. Doors leading to offices off the entrance have half-sidelights and scored concrete surrounds. Corridors on the first story are cross-vaulted, with those on the second story using barrel vaults. Both have concrete ceilings and brick walls. At the end of the north wing's first story, the company meeting room, later converted into a bar and dining room, features paneled wainscoting, stuccoed concrete walls and a concrete ceiling encasing the support beams. The offices elsewhere in the wing have generally been subdivided and modernized, although the second-story corridor's barrel vault, accentuated by spandrels supported by brick piers, is intact. In the drill shed, the ceiling is wainscoted, with steel trusses, exposed brick walls and an intact balcony at the west end. The original hardwood flooring has been covered with wooden tiles. History Schenectady's first armory was built in 1868 to serve two local units, the Washington Continentals and the Citizens' Corps. The former, formed in 1839, had first served in the Mexican War. It was broken up during the recent Civil War but reformed afterwards. The Citizens' Corps was not formally organized until 1873. It joined the New York National Guard in 1880, becoming the 36th Separate Company. Their armory was built with a $30,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) appropriation from the state obtained by newly elected assemblyman Robert Furman. A three-member commission including Furman chose the hill in Crescent Park overlooking the city as the site for a three-story red brick building with a polychrome slate roof. Records show an \\"83rd Regiment\\" drilling in the armory until it disbanded in 1874. It may have become the 36th and 37th Separate Companies. In 1890, sentiment began to grow to build a new armory. State architect Isaac Perry's new building was completed and built on the same site in 1898, just in time for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. It was well- received locally and continued to serve the local Guard units as they prepared and mustered for World War I, where they were designated as the 105th Infantry of the American Expeditionary Force, a name that remained associated with Schenectady for many years. After the war, as many as five separate companies were using the armory, and throughout the 1920s they began lobbying for another new armory. The state finally began construction of the current building in 1936. Unlike other armories built in New York during the Great Depression, Schenectady's was located in the core of the city, near the hotel, the General Electric plant a quarter-mile (400 m) away, and businesses that had flocked to Erie Boulevard, the recently filled former route of the Erie Canal. The old armory in Crescent Park was demolished in 1946. The armory continued to serve local military needs through World War II, the Korean War and the early years of the Cold War. In the early 1960s it was isolated in the neighborhood when I-890 was built. The hotel went bankrupt but was quickly reused as Schenectady County Community College's Elston Hall. By the 21st century the armory had again grown outdated, and the state's Division of Military and Naval Affairs closed it down on November 10, 2008, to save heating costs. College sporting events and other gatherings that had been held in the armory were likewise suspended. The 206th Military Police Company, which had been based there, moved to a new facility in Latham, and the other tenant, the 501st Explosive Ordnance Disposal Battalion, moved to the new Scotia Armed Forces Reserve Center at the Schenectady County Airport. The state sold the armory at auction in July 2012 for $260,000.http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/news/2012/07/24/schenectady-armory- sold-for-260k-at.html It has since reopened as The Schenectady Armory Center, www.schenectadyarmorycenter.com; a multi-use event center focusing on turf sports, trade shows, concerts and community events.

History The Castle Combe airfield opened in May 1941. The land which the airfield occupied belonged to the Castle Combe estate, which was owned by the Gorst family. It was used as a practice landing ground by nearby RAF Hullavington, home of No. 9 Service Flying Training School RAF. Flying training expanded considerably and the facilities were upgraded. Waterlogging was a frequent problem for the grass surface, so two runways of Sommerfeld Tracking were laid and a tarmac perimeter track constructed around the field. There were five hangars on the eastern and south-eastern side of the site; the control tower is still extant.

Early life and career Pugh was born at Green Hill, Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire (which was later renamed Manoravon), the eldest son of Colonel David Heron Pugh, who was High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire in 1819, and his wife Elizabeth Beynon, daughter of William Beynon of Trewern, Llanddewi Velfrey, Pembrokeshire. His brother, John William Pugh, was Vicar of Llandeilo for fifteen years. Pugh was educated at Rugby School and Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1828.Debretts Guide to the House of Commons 1886 In 1837 he was called to the Bar at Inner Temple and for some years he practiced on the Northern Circuit. Local Government and Administration From an early age, Pugh took a close interest in the life of his locality and never devoted himself fully to a legal career. From 1843 until 1852 he was Chairman of the Carmarthesnhire Quarter Sessions, and also served as a Justice of the Peace for Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire and as Deputy Lieutenant. He held a commission as a captain in the Carmarthenshire Rifle Volunteers. Following the death of his brother in 1852, Pugh abandoned his legal career and settled at Manoravon, where he set about developing the estate. He purchased a considerable proportion of the neighbouring Gulston estate for ¬£45,000 and also owned property through his mother's family in the Teifi valley and at St Clears. He was regarded as a popular landlord, partly due to his practice of supporting local tradesmen rather than those based in London. At the time of his death it was said that he regularly granted rent abatements at times of agricultural depression. This was often cited as a reason for his political success, particularly in later life. Pugh owned nearly of land.and was a well known breeder of shorthorn cattle.Matthew Cragoe An Anglican Aristocracy: The moral economy of the landed estate in Carmarthenshire 1832-1895 Oxford Historical Monographs 1996 He was patron and speaker at the Carmarthen Eisteddfod of 1867.The Carmarthen Eisteddfod of 1867 . He was owner of the Pwll Perkins mine, or Garnant Colliery where a disaster led to the loss of 10 lives in 1884. In 1887 he presented a church clock to Llandeilo Parish Church, although the issue of its upkeep caused controversy in the locality. Political career: MP for Carmarthenshire, 1857-1868 In 1857, following the death of David Saunders Davies, Pugh emerged as a candidate for Carmarthenshire and served until 1868. The local Conservative newspaper, the Carmarthen Journal, favoured John Lloyd Davies, former member for Cardigan, and regarded Pugh as an 'untried man'. However, Pugh carried the day, having been proposed at the hustings at Llandeilo by W.R.H. Powell. Although Pugh attracted some criticism for his support of the abolition of church rates, he was returned unopposed, along with David Jones of Pangals, at the General Election of 1859. During this period his politics were often regarded as somewhat ambiguous and he was described as both a Liberal and a Conservative. This proved his undoing at the 1868 General Election when he was defeated in a four-cornered contest for the two seats. On the one hand, Edward Sartoris, a radical Liberal actively sought the support of both the radical wing of the Liberal Party and the powerful nonconformist interest. The Conservatives, meanwhile, fielded both John Jones (brother of the previous member, David Jones, who stood down) and Henry Puxley, a landowner with extensive interests in Ireland. There was much focus during the campaign upon disestablishment of the Church of England in Ireland and Pugh's views were regarded as vague, thus alienating both traditional Conservatives who supported Jones and Puxley, and the more radical Liberals who were supported Sartoris. Pugh, who had been returned unopposed at previous elections, fought a lacklustre campaign, which was chiefly brought to life by the active support of Pugh's close friend, W.R.H. Powell. Although the result was determined to a great extent by a significant increase in the number of industrial workers who were enfranchised, Pugh's defeat was later ascribed to his 'hazy and indefinite opinions'. He was said to have accepted his defeat with 'good humour' but was thereafter regarded as a supporter of Gladstone. Later political career: MP for East Carmarthenshire, 1885-1890 Following his defeat, Pugh withdrew from active political life for some years, but served as High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire in 1874. In later years, Pugh's political views became more radical, and in 1884 he presided at a great demonstration, attended by hundreds of agricultural labourers, in Carmarthen in favour of franchise reform. By 1885 he fully supported disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales. Following the boundary changes introduced as a result of the 1884 Reform Act, the Carmarthenshire parliamentary constituency was divided into eastern and western divisions. The sitting Liberal member, W.R.H. Powell chose to contest the Western division against the other sitting member, Lord Emlyn. However, the Eastern division which contained industrial settlements emerging as a result of the anthracite coal-mining and tinplate industries was considered to be the strongest for the Liberals, as a result of the increased numbers of working-class voters in these communities. For example, the number of voters in that part of the parish of Llanelli that was outside the borough constituency rose from 615 to 1,500, Similarly, the electorate in Pembrey increased from 377 to 1,000, in Hendy from 190 to 620, in Brynamman from 175 to 450, and in Cwmamman from 164 to 550. Nearing eighty years of age, Pugh emerged as a contender for the Liberal nomination and addressed the inaugural meeting of the new Liberal association at Ammanford alongside Lewis Morris and John Lloyd Morgan. Some weeks later, the first gathering of the Council of the new Liberal Association saw Pugh unanimously selected as candidate. He was elected with a large majority over Sir Marteine Lloyd of Bronwydd. Pugh supported Gladstone's Irish Home Rule Bill and was re-elected unopposed when a further general election was held in 1886. Within two years, however, there was increasing criticism within the Liberal Association of Pugh's conduct as member, and particularly his absence from what were perceived to be important divisions in the Commons. He made no recorded contributions to Commons debates during his post-1885 Commons service. It was claimed in January 1888 that, apart from a short speech when re-elected in 1886, he had made no political speeches in the constituency since his election. Following the annual meeting of the Liberal Association at Ammanford on 23 May 1888, when these criticisms were aired by younger members of the Association, a special meeting was called on 30 June to consider the representation of the division. A number of alternative candidates were suggested for the next election and the Rev. Towyn Jones declared that any future candidate should be a radical and a nonconformist. His attendance at the Commons again led to criticism at the annual meeting the following year. In June 1890, Pugh announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He died soon afterwards. Pugh never married. He died at the Metropole Hotel in London, aged 84. He left the bulk of his estate to his kinsman, John Beynon of Trewern, Pembrokeshire.

As of 2019 A3 is an arts magnet school. Health and science In 2012, A3 opened a health and science campus located two blocks from the main campus. Students may attend either campus, but not both.http://www.a3school.org/images/a3application1314.pdf The campus focuses on incorporating science and health topics into in-depth, independently driven projects. Media arts Media students have had internships at several local news stations, including KMTR and KEZI. Media students have also won awards at local film festivals.

It was consecrated in 1838 and was the third catholic parish church of the new diocese of Hildesheim which was authorised by papal bull and was outside of the former bishopric of Hildesheim and Archbishopric of Mainz. It followed in the footsteps of the first two churches: St Clemens in Hanover and St Michael in G√∂ttingen. Its jurisdiction extends as far as the North Sea coast. Louis the Holy, King of France, known as St Louis (), was chosen as the patron saint ‚Äì in deference to King Ludwig I of Bavaria, who had supported its construction with money and a collection in Bavaria. The Church of St Ludwig (Ludwigskirche) stands on the western edge of the town centre, outside the historic Altstadt. The central axis of the French Garden runs directly to the imposing frontage of the church.  Description  St. Ludwig is an example of pure neoclassicism. Only the bases of the towers, completed in 1881, show signs of a Romantic heritage. The interior of the church is a three-aisled hall. The side aisles are flat-roofed, whilst a coffered barrel vault stretches over the main, central aisle, supported on twelve, tall, white, fluted columns. Pastel pink walls and narrow gold piping set them off with shades of colour. The sanctuary is a narrow, only slightly raised extension of the main aisle with flat walls, that is dominated by the tabernacle and a large crucifix, reminiscent of the early Romantic period. In front of it stand the altar and ambon from the modern period. The semi- circular Trinity window in the vault of the sanctuary and the stained glass windows of the side aisles are works of the late 19th century. On 29 June 1986 the St Peter and St Paul Chapel (Peter-und-Paul-Kapelle), on the southwest side of the church, was consecrated, and acts as a place for quiet contemplation and weekday services. A baroque altarpiece contrasts effectively with the contemporary architecture and furnishings.  History  Since the Reformation there had only been individual Catholics in Celle, mostly foreigners in diplomatic service or in court positions. In 1678 Niels Stensen initiated the commissioning of a permanent pastor for them. In 1710 a private house outside the town was converted into a chapel, that was placed under the protection of the apostle Peter and Paul and consecrated by Agostino Steffani. A hundred years later the idea of constructing a proper church took root. The design of the Church of St Ludwig came from the L√ºbeck architect Spetzler, the towers were the work of C. W. Hase and the decoration was by Wilhelm Clausing.

Early life and background Latta was the second son of James Gilmore Latta (1865‚Äì1927) from Troon and Agnes (n√©e Douglas) from Tarbolton. His father was an engineer who had worked for the companies of Andrew Barclay and G. & J. Weir, before becoming part-owner and managing director of the Scottish Stamping & Engineering Company at Ayr in 1920. Latta was educated at University College School, London. First World War On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, both Latta and his older brother, John, enlisted into the London Scottish Regiment, but both subsequently transferred to the Royal Flying Corps. Latta was commissioned as a second lieutenant (on probation) in the RFC on 9 February 1915, and was granted Royal Aero Club Aviators' Certificate No. 2067 on 16 November, after flying a Maurice Farman biplane at the Military School at Norwich, while serving in No. 5 Reserve Aeroplane Squadron. He was appointed a flying officer on 24 February 1916, and confirmed in his rank on 11 March. Latta was posted to No. 1 Squadron to serve as a fighter pilot flying a Nieuport. Latta gained his first victory by destroying an enemy aircraft over Wezmacquart on 1 June 1916. His next two victories, on 25 and 26 June, made him a balloon buster, as he shot down an enemy observation balloon on each day. It also won him the Military Cross, which was gazetted a month later on 27 July. His citation read: On 1 July 1916 Latta was promoted to lieutenant, and was transferred to No. 60 Squadron where he drove down two enemy aircraft out of control on 31 August and 19 September. On 4 October Latta was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain. He was withdrawn from battle for a rest on 23 November, but in May 1917 joined No. 66 Squadron as a flight commander, flying a Sopwith Pup. He was shot down and wounded in action on 8 June. He saw no further active duty after that.Shores et.al. (1990), p.233. Latta was transferred to the unemployed list of the RAF on 2 February 1919. Post-war career Latta returned home to pursue a career in engineering, but retained his interest in aviation. Following the formation of the Auxiliary Air Force, Latta was appointed commander of No. 602 (City of Glasgow) (Bomber) Squadron in October 1925, with the rank of squadron leader. He was unable to take up command until 1 February 1926, so Squadron Leader C. N. Lowe was appointed temporary commander until then. No. 602 Squadron's initial complement consisted of two DH.9As, two Avro 504s, four AAF officers, 83 AAF airmen and 22 regular RAF airmen. However, on 6 May 1927, Latta resigned his commission. In 1934 Latta became chairman and managing director of the Scottish Stamping and Engineering Co. Ltd. At the 1937 British Industries Fair, Scottish Stamping listed its products as drop forgings for the automobile, aircraft, shipbuilding and general engineering trades. In 1938, in co-operation with the Air Ministry, it invested in new buildings and plant for the production of heavy forgings, and during the Second World War became a specialised producer of components for aircraft. In 1939 Latta, alongside such notables as Sir James Lithgow and Sir Steven Bilsland, was among the founders of Scottish Aircraft Components Ltd., a new company formed in Glasgow. Post-war, Scottish Stamping returned to producing vehicle components and drop forgings. The company was bought by GKN in 1953. Latta died in Lancashire in 1974.

N. anthracinus has both sexual and agamic generations and in consequence forms two distinct galls, the oyster gall and April-bud gall. Darlington, Page 160 Synonyms Ameristus F√∂rster 1869, Diplobius Kinsey 1923, Dolichostrophus Ashmead 1887, Neospathogaster Kinsey 1923, Spathegaster Hartig 1840, furunculus Beyerinck 1882, ostreus Giraud 1859, ostria Hartig 1840, Andricus ostreus, Neuroterus schlechtendali and Andricus furunculus are all previous nomenclatures found in the literature. Galls A red spotted example of the gall Oyster gall on a Quercus robur leaf The oyster gall is found on the leaf underside, rarely above, and is around 0.3 cm across, located between the midrib and the lateral veins. It develops under the lower epidermis and when it emerges it has two flaps of valve-like tissue which remain, even after the gall has fallen. The gall has also been recorded as green, brown, pink and even with red spots. The April- bud gall is of brief duration, the bud swelling and the insect emerging within a week from the smooth and oval 0.8 cm gall, tucked up within the bud scales. The old galls show the escape aperture clearly. Life cycle The gall wasp N. albipes, similar to N. anthracinus Agamic generation Emerging in autumn the parthenogenetic female of the agamic generation developed in the unilocular and unilarval bean-shaped structure, which is about 0.8 cm across, known as the 'oyster gall'; they lay eggs within the buds which result in the bisexual generation.Stubbs, Page 48 Sexual generation The males and females emerge from the unilocular and unilarval April-bud galls in the terminal or axillary buds around May; their fertilised eggs placed in the leaf lamina result in the Oyster gall.

Life Ellis was second son of Sir Thomas Ellis of Grantham, Lincolnshire. He was educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, graduating B.A. in 1627.\\"D.N.B. is wrong in making him M.A. at Caius.\\" Having entered Gray's Inn on 6 November 1627 he was called to the bar on 9 February 1634. He represented Boston, Lincolnshire, in the Short parliament of 1640, and also in the Long parliament. After Pride's Purge Ellis was readmitted to the House of Commons on 4 June 1649. On 24 May 1654 he was appointed solicitor-general. Shortly afterwards he was elected an ancient of his inn. As solicitor-general he took part in the prosecution of those involved in the Gerard's conspiracy: John Gerard, Peter Vowell, and Summerset Fox on the charge of corresponding with Charles Stuart and conspiring to assassinate the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell. The trial took place in June 1654. Gerard and Vowell pleaded innocent. They were convicted and sentenced to death. Gerard was beheaded and Vowell was hanged (Fox pleaded guilty and was sentenced to transportation). The same year Ellis was again returned to Parliament for Boston, and in 1656 for Grantham. He was a member of the committee appointed to frame statutes for Durham College in March 1656. In June 1658 he was engaged in the prosecution of John Hewett and John Mordaunt, charged with levying war against the Protector. Hewett was found guilty and Mordaunt acquitted. He was created a baronet by the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell on or soon after 31 May 1658. The baronetcy passed into oblivion at the Restoration in May 1660 and unlike some others was not renewed. Ellis continued in the office of solicitor-general under the second Lord Protector Richard Cromwell. At the election in January 1658-9 for the Third Protectorate Parliament he retained his seat for Grantham. In the debate on the competency of the Scottish members he spoke at length in support of their claims (18 March 1659). Re-elected for Grantham in 1660, Ellis was excluded from the house on the score of his opinions. In autumn 1664 he was appointed reader at Gray's Inn, of which he had been elected a bencher in 1659; on 26 August 1669 he took the degree of serjeant-at-law, and on 10 April 1671 he was advanced to the rank of king's Serjeant and knighted. He was raised to the bench in 1673, taking his seat in the Court of Common Pleas on the first day of Hilary term. The only case of public interest which came before him was that of Barnardiston v.

Maximinus was lieutenant of Ardaburius in the Roman‚ÄìPersian war in 422. In 448, Theodosius II (r. 408‚Äì450) sent him to Attila; Orestes and Edeko, the Hunnic ambassadors at Constantinople, returned with him to Pannonia. Edeko had been bribed by the emperor's chief minister, Chrysaphius, to murder Attila, but on his arrival in Pannonia informed his master of the plot, of which Maximinus was totally ignorant. Attila was well aware of this and consequently turned his resentment only against the emperor and his minister, disdaining even to punish Vigilius, who was the entire promoter of the scheme, and who was entrapped in his turn by Attila. This embassy of Maximinus is described by his secretary, Priscus, to whom is owed nearly all modern knowledge of Attila's person and private life. Afterwards, Maximinus became one of the four principal ministers of the emperor Marcian (r. 450‚Äì457) and in later years held the supreme command in Egypt whence he made a successful campaign against the Ethiopians. He is invariably represented as a virtuous, firm, and highly talented man. (Priscus, p. 39, 40, 48‚Äî70; Socrat. Hist. Eccles., vii. 20; Priscus.)

It is a large white breed known for its hardiness in outdoor (extensive) farming, its long, pear- shaped body and its lop-ears. The breed was first mentioned in the 1870s, and after the Howitt committee report in 1955, became the third most common sire in the United Kingdom after the Large White pig and British Landrace pig. The Welsh pig experienced a decline in numbers in the late twentieth century because consumer demands had changed and the carcase was considered too fatty. In 2005 the breed was considered endangered and later came under the auspices of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust. Since then numbers have expanded somewhat, and by 2012, the registered breeding herd had increased to over 1000 animals. History Pigs with lop ears have been raised in Wales since time immemorial. The Welsh Pig comes from various Welsh towns. In Mid Wales, Montgomery and Cardigan and also in Carmarthen and Pembroke. The earliest references in literature date back to the 1870s when pigs from Wales and Shropshire were being brought to Cheshire for fattening on milk by-products. It was stated that \\"the Welsh pigs are generally a yellow-white, but some are spotted black and white. The (Cheshire) dairymen depend more on these Welshmen and proud Salopians than on breeding. The cross of the Manchester boar with the Shropshire and Welsh produces a larger and coarser breed than the small Yorkshire.\\" There was a decrease in the supply of bacon and pork during World War I, when imports were only available from North America, and in 1918, the Glamorgan Pig Society was formed in South Wales, with the aim of increasing the supply. Two years later, the Welsh Pig Society for West Wales was formed, and after discussion, and as the farmers in Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire were producing a similar type of pig, in 1922 these two breed societies were amalgamated to form the Welsh Pig Society. This published its first herdbook in 1924. The societies were formed with the specific purpose of protecting and promoting the Welsh pig breed. An additional aim was to disseminate the information that the Welsh pig is a good choice for commercial farming. In 1952, the Welsh Pig Society became a member of the National Pig Breeders Association, now known as the British Pig Association. After World War II, there was a large increase in the number of Welsh pigs as suitable commercial feed became more available. Licences issued for Welsh boars increased dramatically from 41 in 1949 to 1,363 in 1954. The number of pedigree Welsh sows also increased greatly, rising from 850 in 1952 to 3,736 in 1954. This breed of pig became incredibly popular in the mid-20th century and became a crucial breed for the pig industry. The Howitt Committee was set up in 1955 to consider the future of the pig industry in the United Kingdom. It advised the government to concentrate production on three breeds, the Large White, the Landrace and the Welsh pig, and this led to a decline in the other native breeds. In 1973 the Rare Breeds Survival Trust was set up to try to prevent the extinction of many of the British traditional breeds. Nowadays, the Welsh pig is not so widely kept as a pure breed but is used extensively in cross-breeding programmes. By 2005, the number of registered breeding animals had dwindled and the Welsh pig was declared \\"endangered\\", and later reclassified as a rare breed. This was due to changes in consumer habits and the large numbers of hybrid pigs being produced by the corporate farming industry, which resulted in a dwindling in the pure bred pig population. In 2008 there were 373 registered females from 24 bloodlines, and 108 registered males. By 2012, the numbers had grown, and there were 837 registered females and 238 registered males. Description The modern Welsh has a moderately wide head with lopped ears and a straight nose. The ears do not quite extend as far as the snout. The neck is moderately deep and the shoulders are flat at the top, supporting a long, strong and level back. The forelegs are set widely apart and the rib cage is deep. The tail is thick and smooth at the root and the underline of the animal is straight. The loin is well-muscled and the flank and belly are thick. The hind-quarters are strong but not flabby, with well-rounded hams that are firm and thick. The hind legs are of moderate length, straight with good bone and set widely apart. The skin is thin and unwrinkled and the coat is fine and straight. Welsh pigs are generally white in colour but sometimes have a few black spots. Both sexes have at least twelve teats. Boars are generally about in weight and sows range from about . In the nineteenth century, the Welsh was described to have rather long legs and to be a razorback whilst being a slow maturer and coarse-haired. The Welsh pig is a hardy animal and thrives both indoors and in more extensive outdoor systems. Uses The Welsh pig is bred commercially because it produces high-quality bacon and pork. It provides a lean carcase with a high killing- out percentage. It retains sufficient fat cover to produce succulent, well- flavoured meat but is not excessively fat. Even when grown on to heavier weights, it grades well. Other advantages include a good feed conversion rate, good mothering abilities and a high survival rate for the piglets. The sows can be used in a breeding programme with Large White or Landrace boars to produce fast-growing, cross-bred progeny, and the boars can also be used on other rare breed sows to produce leaner, faster-growing young with improved conformation.

Powell Walter Rice Howell Powell (1819 ‚Äì 26 June 1889) was a Welsh landowner and Liberal politician. He was Member of Parliament for Carmarthenshire from 1880 until 1885 and for West Carmarthenshire from 1885 until his death in 1889. Powell is still remembered in Llanboidy by the drinking fountain inscribed \\"This fountain is erected to commemorate the completion of the work for supplying this village with water in compliance with the last wish of W. R. H. Powell M.P.\\" Early life Powell was the son of Walter Powell and his wife Mary Powell. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford. On the death of his father in 1834 he inherited Maesgwynne estate of in the parish of Llanboidy, Carmarthenshire, which had been owned by the Howell family.National Library of Wales Maesgwynne Estate Records Personal life Powell married Mary Anne, daughter of Henry Skrine, of Warleigh Manor, Somerset. They had one daughter. Following her death he married the daughter of Grismond Phillips of Cwmgwilly, and they also had a daughter who married W.F. Roch of Butter Hill, Pembrokeshire. Powell and the Maesgwynne Estate From an early age, Powell took an active interest in hunting, and is said to have spent much of his time at Oxford engaged in this pastime. For 50 years he was master of the foxhounds. He was a J.P. for Pembroke, Carmarthen and Cardiganshire and was High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire in 1849.Debretts Guide to the House of Commons 1886 In 1867 he funded a 24 piece brass band for Llanboidy.Matthew Cragoe An Anglican Aristocracy:: The moral economy of the landed estate in Carmarthenshire 1832-1895 Oxford Historical Monographs 1996 He was responsible for building a new Market Hall in Llanboidy and also, during the 1870s, funded the restoration of the parish church. Political career Powell was engaged in public life from an early age and was High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire in 1840. For many years he supported the Conservative Party but, as was noted at the time of his death, he \\"gave active support to men who could not be called genuine Conservatives, and he appears to have long cherished certain opinions of a democrative kind.\\" This can be seen from his comments when nominating David Jones of Pantglas, the sitting member for Carmarthenshire, as a candidate at the General Election of 1857. Powell stated that partisan colours were no longer shown at election times and this, he believed \\"was an evidence that party feeling was dying out in the country\\". Later that year, when a by-election was held, Powell was a leading supporter of David Pugh, the Liberal-Conservative who represented Carmarthenshire in the House of Commons from 1857 until 1868. At the hustings at Llandeilo it was Powell who formally proposed Pugh. Pugh's political views were often described as vague and ambiguous, and for that reason he was placed at a disadvantage at the 1868 General Election when opposed by candidates who held pronounced Conservative and radical Liberal political views. Powell emerged as Pugh's leading supporter and public advocate during the 1868 election, and Pugh later followed Powell into the Liberal ranks. Monument to Walter Rice Howell Powell MP (1819-89) at Llanboidy NLW3361627 In 1874, Powell unsuccessfully contested Carmarthenshire as a Liberal candidate. Two years later he was briefly mentioned as a possible Liberal candidate for Carmarthen Boroughs following the resignation of Charles Nevill although there was no real prospect of him contesting this urban constituency. Powell was elected Member of Parliament for Carmarthenshire in 1880 and when it was divided in 1885 he chose to contest the new West Carmarthenshire, which included his estate at Maesgwynne. The constituency was considered less favourable to the Liberals than neighbouring East Carmarthenshire which included a range of growing industrial communities. In addition, Powell was opposed by the other retiring member for Carmarthenshire, Viscount Emlyn. Powell proclaimed that he had a duty to the Liberal cause to oppose Emlyn. The overwhelmingly nonconformist character of the constituency was regarded as a distinct advantage to the Liberal candidate, and a combination of resentment of the established church (largely driven by such issues as the tithe and church rates) and the direct influence of the chapels was predicted to be decisive in attracting the votes of agricultural labourers. Nonconformist ministers were often claimed to have a disproportionate influence over electoral behaviour.Contemporary press reports of political meetings addressed by Powell provide evidence that nonconformist ministers played a leading role. After a vigorous contest, Powell eventually won a decisive victory. Powell held the seat until his death in 1889.Leigh Rayment In some quarters he was criticised for his relative silence in the House and lack of engagement with the great political issues of the day. Amongst the electors of West Carmarthenshire however, and especially after the extension of the franchise in 1884, he proved a very popular member who was regarded as being sympathetic with the views of those he represented.

They have sometimes been referred to as Greater Punjabi.For the use of the term \\"Greater Panjabi\\", see and . The literary languages that have developed on the basis of dialects of this area are Standard Punjabi in eastern and central Punjab, Saraiki in the southwest, Hindko in the northwest, Pahari-Pothwari in the north. A distinction is usually made between Punjabi in the east and the diverse group of \\"Lahnda\\" in the west. \\"Lahnda\\" typically subsumes the Saraiki and Hindko varieties, with Pahari‚ÄìPothwari, Shahpuri and Jhangvi intermediate between the two groups.Pothwari has previously been regarded as part of \\"Lahnda\\", but argues that it shares features with both groups. Jhangvi and Shahpuri are transitional between Saraiki and Punjabi. Commonly recognised Eastern Punjabi dialects include Doabi, Majhi (the standard), Malwai, and Puadhi. The Bagri language in the southeast is transitional to Haryanvi, whereas the \\"Lahnda\\" variety of Khetrani in the far west may be intermediate between Saraiki and Sindhi. The varieties of \\"Greater Punjabi\\" have a number of characteristics in common, for example the preservation of the Prakrit double consonants in stressed syllables. Nevertheless, there is disagreement on whether they form part of a single language group, with some proposed classifications placing them all within the Northwestern zone of Indo-Aryan, while others reserving this only for the western varieties, and assigning the eastern ones to the Central zone alongside Hindi. Standard Punjabi Standard Punjabi, sometimes referred to as Majhi in India or simply Punjabi, is the most widespread and largest dialect of Punjabi. It first developed in the 12th century and gained prominence when Sufi poets such as Shah Hussain, Bulleh Shah among others began to use the Lahore/Amritsar spoken dialect with infused Persian vocabulary in their works in the Shahmukhi script. Later the Gurmukhi script was developed based on Standard Punjabi by the Sikh Gurus. Standard Punjabi is spoken by the majority of the people in Faisalabad, Lahore, Gujranwala, Sheikhupura, Kasur, Sialkot, Narowal, Okara, Pakpattan, Sahiwal, Hafizabad, Nankana Sahib districts of Pakistan's Punjab Province. It also has a large presence in every district in the rest of Pakistani Punjab, and in all large cities in Pakistan's other provinces. In India it is spoken in Amritsar, Tarn Taran Sahib, Pathankot and Gurdaspur Districts of the State of Punjab and sizable population also in major cities of the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Mumbai India. In Pakistan Standard Punjabi dialect is not called Majhi which is Indian terminology, in Pakistan it is simply called Standard Punjabi. This dialect is used for both Punjabi Films, TV and Theater industry to make Punjabi language content in Lahore. See also * Dogri References Sources Burling, Robbins. 1970. Man's many voices.

The Club is a member of the German Olympic Sports Confederation, and the responsible body for sport and competition climbing, hiking, mountaineering, hill walking, ice climbing, mountain expeditions, as well as ski mountaineering. History The German Alpine Club was founded as on 9 May 1869 in Munich by 36 former members of the Austrian Alpine Club around the √ñtztal curate Franz Senn, in order to promote the tourist development of the Eastern Alps by the erection of mountain huts, hiking trails, and via ferratas. The association enjoyed a large clientele from the beginning, with a number of 1070 members after only 10 months. Mountain hut notice prohibiting the entry of Jews and Donauland members, c.1930 The German and the Austrian societies merged in 1873 to form the German and Austrian Alpine Club (D√ñAV). Already in the late 19th century, the association's policies were increasingly characterized by nationalism and antisemitism. In 1899 the Brandenburg section amended an \\"Aryan paragraph\\" to exclude non-Christian members, followed by the Vienna section in 1905 and the Alpine corporations of Vienna and Munich in 1907 and 1910. After World War I, the Jewish associates like Viktor Frankl and Fred Zinnemann (adding up to about one third of the membership) were banned in most of the sections and in turn established a separate Donauland section insisting on their D√ñAV fellowship. The Donauland members were officially ousted in 1924. Jews were even banned from visiting the D√ñAV mountain huts.Helmuth Zebhauser: Alpinismus im Hitlerstaat, M√ºnchen 1998, . Neueres zum Antisemitismus des Vereins in Panorama. Mitteilungsblatt des DAV Heft 1/2007, S. 60‚Äì62, von Nicholas Mail√§nder, siehe Weblinks: Donaulandaff√§re Upon the 1938 Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany, the D√ñAV was renamed Deutscher Alpenverein (DAV) under the leadership of Arthur Seyss-Inquart and incorporated as mountaineering division of the Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund f√ºr Leibes√ºbungen (National Socialist League of the Reich for Physical Exercise) organization. After World War II, the DAV was dissolved by the Allied authorities. Its assets were held by the Austrian Alpine Club as trustee. The German Alpine Club was re- established in 1952. It joined the organization in 1992. After leaving the Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme in 2008, mainly due to differences in respecting both competitions and recreational sports, the German and Austrian Alpine Clubs rejoined the Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme in 2013. Structure Edelweiss badge The DAV is an umbrella organization of 358 legally independent regional sections with a total of around 1,3 million DAV in Zahlen members. Every section is a registered voluntary association (Eingetragener Verein, e.V.) in its own right; it exclusively admits to membership. The collective body of the sections is represented by the general assembly, association council, and presidium. Main task of the Club is the maintenance of mountain huts. The sections currently provide 321 alpine club huts DAV in Zahlen to hikers and mountaineers, as well as 207 indoor climbing gyms DAV in Zahlen . The DAV publishes Alpine Club maps and the Alpine Club Guides in cooperation with Bergverlag Rother, organises hillwalks and alpine style tours, has mountaineering equipment available and arranges collective insurances. It also runs the Alpine Museum on Prater Island in Munich. In recent years, the Club's policies have turned to habitat conservation of fauna and flora of the Alps.

It was later used as the company sales machine. Design and development The P.6 was only the second aircraft designed and built by Boulton & Paul, although during the First World War they had built many aircraft under contract, including 1,575 Sopwith Camels. the P.6 was a wood and fabric two-seat single-engined single-bay biplane. Its wings were without stagger or sweep, with a constant chord of 5 ft (1.52 m) on both wings. The intention was to explore the effects of different airfoil sections and the large interplane gap, also 5 ft, would have helped to reduce the complications of interference effects. The initial section used was RAF15. There were ailerons on both upper and lower wings. The fuselage was flat sided with a rounded top, rather similar in construction to that of the Camel and using many Camel parts. The fin and horn balanced rudder together were almost circular and the tailplane was braced to the fin. The large interplane gap put the upper wing well above the fuselage with the centre section braced to front and rear spars by outward sloping struts from the upper longerons. The pilot's cockpit was under the trailing edge, where there was a cut-out for visibility and the passenger sat in a separate cockpit under the wing. The 90 hp (67 kW) RAF 1a engine drove a four bladed, 9 ft 3 in (2.82 m) diameter propeller and was partly enclosed in a metal cowling, with the cylinder heads protruding as it was air-cooled. There was a simple single axle undercarriage and tail skid. The date of the first flight is not known, but it was probably towards the end of 1918. The first drawings were dated April 1918 and the aircraft was certainly beyond its initial flight tests in March 1919 when it provided the wife of Dawson Paul, one of the company directors, with her first flight. Though shortly after that the P.6 received the civil registration G-EACJ (K-120),CAA registration document for G-EACJ it may well have never displayed this identity. In all known photographs it wears the experimental number X.25, the last one of this series inaugurated in 1917. In addition it was painted with RAF roundels and tail stripes. Operational history It is not known if wings of other sections were fitted as originally intended, but useful aerodynamic data was gathered. It flew rather well and by May 1919 Boulton & Paul were using it as their sales machine, with the company name in large print on the fuselage side in addition to the roundels. This corporate aircraft made perhaps the first business flight, from Boulton & Paul's airfield on Mousehold Heath at Norwich to Bury St Edmunds about 36 miles (58 km) away.

Its range extends from Murmansk and the coasts of Norway to the Faeroes, the Kattegat, the United Kingdom and the Bay of Biscay. It is present in the Rockall Trough. It is found in Norwegian fiords on muddy bottoms at depths of . It is also found in the Porcupine Seabight and on the Porcupine Abyssal Plain in the Northeast Atlantic at much greater depths. Biology Psilaster andromeda is a carnivore, detritivore and omnivore. It mainly feeds on molluscs such as Abra. Nucula, Rissoa and Tellina, echinoderms, foraminifera, and sometimes crustaceans and annelids. The gonads of Psilaster andromeda are located at the base of the arms and each one opens through a single gonopore. Fewer than 300 small oocytes are produced by each gonad. Some of these are phagocytosed and others are supplied with yolks and grow in size before being spawned. A parasitic turbellarian Triloborhynchus psilastericola is often present in the coelom of the starfish and when the worm is approaching maturation, it moves into the pyloric caeca and at the same time loses all its cilia.

Biography De Jongh was the son of a shoemaker, who wanted to teach his son his craft. When his father moved to Rotterdam, the young Ludolf decided to learn art rather than shoemaking, and became a pupil of Cornelis Saftleven. Later he studied under Anthony Palamedes in Delft, and later still with Jan van Bijlert in Utrecht.Ludolf de Jong biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature In 1635, he travelled to France with Frans Bacon. Seven years later, in 1642, he returned to the Netherlands when he heard that his mother had fallen ill. He set up shop in Rotterdam, and his earliest signed paintings date from that year. According to Houbraken his travels had caused him to speak French so fluently that he forgot Dutch, and his parents had to get someone who spoke French in order to communicate with him. De Jongh's work shows a strong influence from the Utrecht school of Caravaggio admirers, especially Jacob Duck, but also from Pieter de Hooch. In the 1650s he was one of the most fashionable painters of Rotterdam. He experimented with various innovations in portraiture in this period, both from a psychological perspective with expressions, but also with the use of space and lighting. He married the daughter of a member of the highest circles of Rotterdam, Pieter Montagne, and was granted a rank of major of Rotterdam. In 1664 he became scout of Hillegersberg, a function he fulfilled until his death. From 1660 onwards he painted less, and this may have been due to his responsibilities as a major, as a merchant, and later, as magistrate in Hillegersberg. He did paint a schuttersstuk, however, which Houbraken saw in the target practise hall in the next century.

The film stars Olympia Dukakis, Ellen Burstyn, Diane Ladd and Danny Aiello. Plot Based on the play by Ivan Menchell, this comedy-drama concerns three friends, Doris (Olympia Dukakis), Lucille (Diane Ladd), and Esther (Ellen Burstyn). All three live in the same Jewish community in Pittsburgh, are in their mid-to- late 50s, and have become widows within the past few years. Once a week, they gather to visit their husbands' graves and meet at a deli afterward to talk about their lives. Doris remains fiercely devoted to her late husband and takes her responsibilities as a widow seriously. Lucille is eager to get her feet back in the waters of dating, partly as revenge against her late husband, who often cheated on her, and partly because she's very lonely by herself. Esther is also not used to being alone after 39 years of marriage, but she doesn't feel ready to start dating again, at least not until she meets Ben (Danny Aiello), a former cop turned cab driver who gradually but firmly eases his way into her life. Doris is appalled when she discovers that Esther is dating again and loudly protests that she's being disrespectful to her late husband, while Lucille is more than a bit jealous that Esther snagged a good man before she could. All of which comes to fruition at the wedding of their friend Selma (Lainie Kazan). Jerry Orbach and Lee Richardson appear in a brief prologue sequence.

It was written and directed by Nicholas Jacobs. The film tells the story about a couple that move into an apartment in New York with a refrigerator that contains the portal to hell. Background The first draft of the script was written in 1987 and the film took four years altogether to make.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102767/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv The Refrigerator was filmed within New York in America, by production companies Connexion Film Productions and Avenue D Films.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102767/companycredits?ref_=tt_dt_co As an independent production with a limited budget, the filmmakers decided not to get the film rated by the MPAA and as a result it was released straight to video and promptly disappeared. It was first seen in Germany at the June 1991 Munich Film Festival. On 25 September 1992, it premiered in New York and during 1993 it had a theatrical release across Germany via Impuls-Film Hans- Joachim Flebbe Co. The film was released on VHS in Germany via Warner Home Video on 25 February 1993. Later in the UK, on 10 July 1995, it had a limited release on VHS via the studio Mia (Missing in Action). In America, the film had a very limited video release in 1993 via Monarch Home Video. It has never seen an official DVD release. The film is similar to the Filipino horror film Shake Rattle and Roll's episode: Pridyider, which was also remade in 2012, also known as Fridge. Plot The film opens with a couple drunk driving through the streets of New York. Upon arriving at their apartment, they make love in front of the kitchen. Afterwards, the wife walks into the kitchen whereupon the refrigerator opens up and sucks her in. Steve & Eileen Bateman move to New York, renting the apartment with the killer refrigerator. Steve takes a new job, while Eileen dreams of becoming a performer. She pretends to receive an award then walks all over Broadway. Steve, Nanny and Eileen begin to have nightmares about the refrigerator: Steve sees mini people inside the refrigerator (supposed victims) while Eileen sees unborn babies. Steve is slowly driven to insanity by the refrigerator's influence, leaving Eileen to cope with her acting career on her own. Juan, a plumber, comes to the apartment one night, warning Eileen that her refrigerator is from hell and the devil controls it. Steve, Nanny and Eileen throw a party at their apartment one night. The refrigerator brings the other kitchen appliances to life and begins slaughtering the guests. Juan ties the refrigerator shut, and the surviving guests flee. Later, another couple is shown interested in buying the apartment.

First-time director Nicholas Jacobs's juxtaposition of genres is compelling in thought, but unfortunately on film the results just don't measure up. While the basic premise of The Refrigerator - take a couple of dream yuppies and plop them into a world of madness and horror - is satirical and wry, the final results aren't very satisfying. The main failure of the film is that none of the separate entities work on their own - the funny scenes generally aren't funny and the scary parts, while original in idea, aren't scary, only overly gory. On top of this, Jacobs throws in a couple of ultraserious segments involving the mother-daughter relationship that are completely out of place. Mueller and Simonds as the jinxed couple offer up the right amount of exuberance and angst. Caban, though, as the plumber who looks more like an urban commando, best fits his role. Jacobs's eclectic use of music, from campy to melodramatic, is one of the highlights of the film. If he had put a little more punch in his screenplay, been more daring with his satire and put some real scares in the film, the end result would have made a lot more sense.

Searcy (1921 - September 17, 2009) was a member of the Tuskegee Airmen, a group of African American military personnel who served with distinction during World War II as the 332nd Fighter Group of the US Army Air Corps. After the war, Searcy lived in Los Angeles, California. He died of colorectal cancer in September 2009 at age 88. Tuskegee Airmen Searcy was born in Mount Pleasant, Texas, and attended Prairie View A&M; University before enlisting in the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1942 following the United States' entry into World War II. Searcy received basic training at Ft. Hood, Texas, and was assigned to lead a group of airmen to Tuskegee, Alabama. He later recalled receiving his first taste of segregation when his men were denied access to the Pullman car's dining and sleeping quarters on the train to Tuskegee. Searcy demanded passage, and the porters, most of whom were African-American, eventually agreed to allow them to pass. Searcy recalled, \\"I was put in charge of those men. I felt I had to represent what the Constitution was for those men. That's what leadership is.\\" Searcy served with the Tuskegee Airmen in Italy, France, the Balkans, the Rhineland, and elsewhere in Europe between 1942 and 1945. He received commendations for supporting combat missions over Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, and was honorably discharged in 1945. Post-war years Fundraising poster featuring the Tuskegee Airmen. Searcy later recalled that he tried for years \\"to forget serving as a Tuskegee Airman\\" and thought of his service in the segregated U.S. military \\"as two years, 10 months and 27 days lost.\\" He had enlisted hoping to become a pilot, but he was assigned to work in a support position as a clerk in military intelligence. He had hoped to become a doctor before the war, but did not complete college after the war. After the war, Searcy worked for United Airlines cleaning aircraft in the 1950s. He also worked at a U.S. Post office in downtown Los Angeles and sold women's clothing. He also opened several clothing stores in Los Angeles, California. Searcy married, but had no children. His wife died in an automobile accident in 1990. Searcy was a resident of Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California, in his later years. Attendance at Barack Obama's inauguration Despite being a Republican, Searcy supported the candidacy of Barack Obama, encouraging others at his Van Nuys retirement home to vote for Obama. Obama invited all of the living Tuskegee Airmen to his inauguration, and a Mississippi ophthalmologist, Dr. Lynn McMahan, flew Searcy and three other Tuskegee Airmen to Washington, D.C., in his private jet. In agreeing to fly the men, McMahan said, \\"The Tuskegee Airmen are to pilots like Michael Jordan is to basketball, and Tiger Woods is to golf.\\" In video footage from the Chicago Tribune, Searcy says of Obama's inauguration, \\"When I leave this earth, I leave it with a smile on my face.\\" Death Searcy died of colorectal cancer in September 2009 at age 88 while visiting his granddaughter in Atlanta, Georgia.

The team posted an overall record and were in conference, later changed to and This was Chuck Fairbanks' last season as Sooner head coach; he left for the New England Patriots of the NFL. The Sooners' 1972 record is marred by the use of an ineligible player. In self-reporting the violations to the NCAA, Oklahoma voluntarily forfeited eight games. The NCAA later penalized the program by reducing scholarships, TV appearances and bowl appearances. In 2008 a blogger for Washington, DC TV station WJLA stated, \\"The NCAA claims that according to a now-retired statistician of the era, and a review of its database (which the NCAA admits might not be totally complete) that forfeits were NOT part of the NCAA sanctions levied against the Sooners.\\" A commenter stated, \\"The 1972 forfeits by Oklahoma were sanctioned by The Big Eight.

This area is located northwest of the Las Vegas Strip and the \\"Spaghetti Bowl\\" interchange of I-15 and US 95. It is also known as Historic West Las Vegas and more simply, the Westside. The area is roughly bounded by Carey Avenue, Bonanza Road, I-15 and Rancho Drive. This is about the specific historic area. In many uses, West Las Vegas can mean any portion of the area west of I-15.  History  In the 1920s no segregation laws on the books barred black citizens from participating in community life, but with legalization of gambling (1931), repeal of prohibition (1933) and completion of the Boulder Dam (1935) and with tourism on the rise, casino owners began restricting their patrons to whites only. This was mainly due to the influx of Southerners caused by the previously mentioned events; pioneer Nevada had no colour bar. Blacks were allowed to entertain or work in casinos, but they were not allowed to attend shows, live in the casino district, or obtain or renew business licenses. In response to the segregation, blacks in effect created their own Las Vegas that offered everything the real city did. The area even had its own version of the Las Vegas Strip, the Black Strip in an area around Jackson Avenue. In 1942, when Sarann Knight-Preddy moved to Las Vegas, the only club on the west side was the Harlem Club. It was followed by the Brown Derby (1944) and later that same year, the Cotton Club. By 1947, four black-owned clubs were found on Jackson Street: the Brown Derby, the Chickadee (sometimes styled as the Chic-A Dee Club), the Cotton Club, and the Ebony Club. In addition to black-owned clubs, clubs owned by Chinese immigrants targeted black customers and did not have discriminatory hiring practices. Chinese-owned clubs included the Chickadee (later known as Zee Louie's Chickadee Club and even later as the Louisiana Club); the Westside Club; and the Town Tavern. The area was booming by the 1940s and 1950s, in part due to the ammunition depot at nearby Hawthorne, but also because black entertainers who worked in the clubs on the strip weren't allowed to stay on the strip. When they finished their performances, they came to party, relax, or jam at the Westside clubs. Town Tavern was one of the \\"hot spots\\" frequented by such performers as Louis Armstrong, The Ink Spots, Little Milton, Ed Sullivan in the 1950s and up until desegregation Cab Calloway, Chubby Checker, Nat King Cole, Sammy Davis Jr., Sonny Liston or other notables might be seen regularly. The Moulin Rouge Hotel opened on May 24, 1955 and was the first integrated hotel casino in Las Vegas. It had all the same amenities ‚Äî gourmet food, pool, casino, lounge, and showroom ‚Äî as hotels on the strip. It had taken $3.5 million to build and quickly became a sensation, appearing on the June 20th, 1955 cover of Life magazine and the place where all of the A-list performers of the late 1950s performed, such as Louis Armstrong, Tallulah Bankhead, Harry Belafonte, Milton Berle, Nat King Cole, Sammy Davis Jr., Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, Bob Hope, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, and many others. But just as quickly, it crashed, when in November, 1955 it closed and by December its owners had filed bankruptcy. In 1958, the City of Las Vegas passed an ordinance that forbade black dealers, but in the same year, for the first time gambling regulations were passed which set up inspectors and a Gaming Control Board. One of the first inspectors was Clarence Ray, who would later operate the only licensed dealing school to train black dealers for work on the strip at the beginning of desegregation. In 1960, Hank Greenspun, one time owner of the Las Vegas Sun, met with city leaders and members of the NAACP at the closed Moulin Rouge to work out the desegregation agreement for all of the casinos of the Strip. Once segregation lost its hold on the city, the area fell into disrepair as the more prosperous blacks moved to other areas of the community, or preferred to work on the Strip for the higher wages offered. In 1971, Vegas housing codes were modified to prevent redlining, allowing blacks to move out of West Vegas. Many people in the community felt there was an effort to prevent blacks from owning clubs. Senator Joe Neal confirmed that licenses were denied after the Civil Rights Movement. There were attempts to keep the area thriving, like when Leonard Roy and his son tried to revamp the Moulin Rouge and reopen it in 1977. They were unable to obtain liquor licenses, so they opened a coffee shop there and ran the hotel for three years before it failed again. In the 1980s, Bob Bailey began a non-profit organization with hopes of revitalizing Jackson Avenue (known to locals as Jackson Street). Knight-Preddy became president of the Jackson Street Redevelopment Company, which had plans to create a pedestrian mall along four blocks of west Las Vegas, the historic black neighborhood of the city. They got contracts signed, were promised federal loan funds, had a feasibility study completed and made a marketing video. Knight-Preddy, her husband Joe Preddy and their son, James Walker, made another attempt to revive the Moulin Rouge in the early 1990s, and had difficulty obtaining licenses. Then in 1992, the West Las Vegas riots, sparked by the Rodney King verdicts spread into West Las Vegas and resulted in property damage and mob violence, which continued for several weeks. Later that same year, Knight-Preddy got the Moulin Rouge approved on the National Register of Historic Places and hoped that it would spark revitalization, but it burned in a major fire in 2003 and again in 2009. As late as 2000, Preddy was still trying to convince investors and city founders to create a welcoming space for development by ridding the area of crime and provide an infusion of capital to stop the decay of the historic area, but by 2005, the city had pulled out of the investment plan.

These materials include toys, books, games, building blocks and music, along with traditional teaching resources and curriculum materials. Some learning stores offer materials for developmentally disabled adults as well. The term learning store was coined in 1984 by the Golden Apple Learning Store. Large chains such as Early Learning Centre now exist and learning stores can now be found in many urban and suburban areas.  Types of materials  Learning stores have traditionally offered less mainstream toys such as BRIO, Playmobil, Melissa & Doug, or toys sold primarily in the speciality toy market. Other resources found at Learning Stores are often published by small educational publishers outside of the mainstream textbook publishing world. Learning stores and their suppliers are generally members of either the American Specialty Toy Retailing Association (ASTRA) or the National School Supply and Equipment Association (NSSEA).  Other usage  A University Learning Store was launched in 2016 to deliver online, on-demand, and skills-focused courses for employees and employers. It was introduced by a group of non-profit universities. A different concept of learning store is also used in business as a strategy within the so-called triple-loop learning. It is a store set-up by a retailer or enterprise to try out radical ideas or innovations.

Biography Farrar was born in Alexandria, Louisiana. He received his bachelor's degree in 1985 from Northeast Louisiana University in Monroe and his law degree from Southern University Law Center in Baton Rouge in 1991.Votesmart.org.-Rick Farrar Farrar died at Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans at the age of 58.Rick Farrar, former District 27 State Rep, dies at 58 Political career In 1991, Farrar unseated long-term Democratic incumbent Carl Newton Gunter, Jr., of Deville in the eastern portion of Rapides Parish, 7,729 votes (57 percent) to Gunter's 5,929 (43 percent), exactly 1,800 votes. Gunter ran into organized opposition from feminist groups who oppose his pro- life stance. On October 21, 1995, Farrar was unseated by the Republican Randy E. Wiggins of Pineville, a State Farm Insurance agent in Alexandria. Wiggins received 6,350 votes (51.1 percent) to Farrar's 6,077 (48.9 percent). Wiggins is the first Republican ever elected to the Louisiana House from Rapides Parish since the days of Reconstruction. In 1999, Farrar staged a comeback when Wiggins ran, not for reelection, but to the Louisiana State Senate seat vacated by B.G. Dyess, who retired after a single term. Wiggins narrowly lost to former Senator Joe McPherson, a businessman then from Pineville and later Woodworth. On October 23, 1999, in the nonpartisan blanket primary, often called the jungle primary, Republican school board member Randall Bryan \\"Randy\\" Tannehill (born 1960), also of Pineville, led Farrar, 4,442 (41.4 percent) to, 4,088 (38.1 percent). A third candidate, Democrat Pete Ferrington of Pineville, polled a critical 2,208 votes (20.6 percent). In the ensuing general election, Farrar topped Tannehill, the son of Fred L. Tannehill (born February 6, 1932), a former member of the Louisiana State Board of Education. Farrar led 4,318 (54.6 percent) to Tannehill‚Äôs 3,595 (45.4 percent). Because of low turnout in the second round of balloting, without a gubernatorial contest, Farrar underpolled his primary totals by 124 votes; Tannehill, by 493 ballots. In 2003, Farrar won again, 7,072 (61 percent) to Pete Ferrington‚Äôs 4,519 (39 percent). In 2005, Farrar was listed as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee under chairman Bryant O. Hammett, Jr., of Ferriday in eastern Louisiana. In 2006, Farrar was among the lawmakers who spoke for passage of the Pet Evacuation Act, authored by State Senator Heulette Fontenot of Livingston Parish. The legislation was approved after the heartbreak of abandoned pets in natural disasters surfaced during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. After Katrina, Farrar spoke out in 2005 against state assistance to keep the New Orleans Saints football within the state. According to Farrar, \\"There's no political will I have been able to find to give them anything at this point. Instead of showing the can-do spirit of getting back on their feet, they took off. That shows a tremendous lack of character.\\" In 2007, Farrar was crushed as he sought his fourth nonconsecutive term in the House by Republican newcomer Chris Hazel, 9,330 votes (62.5 percent) to 5,611 (37.5 percent). Hazel became only the second Republican since Wiggins to hold the District 27 seat since Reconstruction. Until his death, Farrar practiced law in the firm of Farrar & Farrar.

Life   Career  Stephan Buri√°n von Rajecz was born in Stomfa, Kingdom of Hungary (now Stupava, Slovakia) on 16 January 1851 into an ancient Hungarian noble family. In 1891, he married Olga n√©e Freiin Fej√©rv√°ry von Koml√≥s-Keresztes (1861‚Äì1931), a daughter of General G√©za Freiherr Fej√©rv√°ry von Koml√≥s-Keresztes, who briefly served as Hungarian Minister-President.'Buri√°n v. Rajecz, Stephan Graf', Neue Deutsche Biographie, vol. 3, Berlin, Duncker & Humblot, 1957, p. 52. Buri√°n entered the consular branch of the Austro-Hungarian foreign service following graduation from the Consular Academy. He subsequently served in Alexandria, Bucharest, Belgrade and Sofia. From 1882 to 1886 he headed the Consulate General in Moscow before being appointed as consul general in Sofia from 1887 to 1895, then served as minister in Stuttgart from 1896 to 1897 and in Athens from 1897 to 1903, which won him a reputation of a Balkan expert.'Burian von Rajecz Stefan Graf', √ñsterreichisches Biographisches Lexikon 1815‚Äì1950, vol. 1, Vienna, Verlag der √ñsterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1957, p. 129. In 1900, he was raised to the rank of Baron. In July 1903, Baron Buri√°n was appointed by Emperor Franz Joseph I to serve as Joint Finance Minister of Austria-Hungary, replacing the deceased Benjamin K√°llay von Nagy-K√°ll√≥ who had held the post since 1882. While the Imperial Finance Ministry only was responsible for the financing of common aspects of the Dual Monarchy, i.e. the Foreign Policy, the Army and the Navy), the administration of the Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina fell under his responsibility following the annexation in 1908. Buri√°n administered the two territories with a relatively mild hand and attempted to provide the population with a greater voice in the imperial administration. His conciliatory approach, however, failed to calm the country and only earned him the wrath of fellow bureaucrats.'Burian von Rajecz Stefan Graf', op. cit. Buri√°n left the post in February 1912 as he was finding it increasingly difficult to reconcile the various factions.'Graf Istv√°n Buri√°n von Rajecz', Solving Problems Through Force In June 1913, Baron Buri√°n was appointed minister besides the King of Hungary, i.e. the Hungarian minister to the Court of Vienna, the closest connection between the Court of Vienna and Budapest.Spencer C. Tucker (ed.), The European Powers in the First World War: An Encyclopedia, New York, Garland, 1996, p. 153. In his position of Hungarian emissary to Vienna, he successfully mediated between Foreign Minister Count Berchtold and the Hungarian Minister-President Count Tisza during the July Crisis.Graydon A. Tunstall, Jr, 'Austria-Hungary', in Richard F. Hamilton & Holger H. Herwig (eds.), The Origins of World War I, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 120.  World War I  In January 1915, Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Count Berchtold was pressured by Germany to make territorial concessions to Italy as the price of securing that country's neutrality. When he acquiesced to the German proposal, he was forced from office on 13 January by hardliners.Tucker, op. cit. Baron Buri√°n's name was put forward by Count Tisza, who was a close friend and ally, as Berchtold's successor which was accepted, albeit reluctantly, by Emperor Franz Joseph.'Graf Istv√°n Buri√°n von Rajecz', op. cit. Baron Buri√°n intended to increase the prestige of the monarchy and to get parity with Germany but also to negotiate peace with the help of the Americans. (He would fail in the latter, after Germany announced in 1916 that it intended to start full submarine warfare, leading the US to prepare for war.) A relative moderate, he initially resisted German pressure for territorial concessions as the price of maintaining Italy's neutrality, although he somewhat vacillated towards the end as Austro-Hungarian forces suffered a crushing defeat with the surrender of Przemysl in March. This did nothing, however, to prevent Italy from joining the Entente in May 1915 and declaring war. Considered a prot√©g√© of Count Tisza, he proved to be much steadfast in resisting German pressure as regards territorial concessions to Romania at the cost of Hungary. This led to Romania entering the side of the Entente in August 1916. Baron Buri√°n resisted the plan to offer vast amounts of territory to Bulgaria but he did win Bulgaria to the side of the Central Powers in October 1915 and provided for stronger ties with Turkey.Tucker, op. cit. Baron Buri√°n insisted that Germany treat Austria- Hungary as an equal in all military, economic and political activism, which only antagonised German opinion. He opposed Germany‚Äôs policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, insisted on retention of Austro-Hungarian control on the Balkan front and demanded recognition of Austro-Hungarian interests in Poland. However, he increasingly lacked the material resources to back up his claims for equality with Germany.Stephen Pope & Elizabeth-Anne Wheal, The Macmillan Dictionary of the First World War, London, Macmillan, 1995, p. 93f. He further angered Germany and its military leaders by proposing a peace plan that called for the re-establishment of a free Belgium and the return of all captured French territory in exchange for recognition of German and Austro-Hungarian rights in Eastern Europe. As a result of this peace proposal, he was forced to resign in December 1916, which reflected the extent of German control over imperial policy.Tucker, op. cit. He was replaced by Count Czernin and returned to serve as Imperial Finance Minister. Baron Buri√°n in 1918 Following the Sixtus affair, the position of Count Czernin had become untenable and on 15 April 1918, Baron Buri√°n was recalled by Emperor Charles I to serve as Imperial Foreign Minister again, with instructions to negotiate an end to the war on favorable terms. Buri√°n sought a compromise peace settlement, a course he had consistently advocated, but the Habsburg Empire‚Äôs deteriorating military situation provided him little margin for manoeuvre facing increasing disputes with the German ally.Holger H. Herwig & Neil M. Heyman, Biographical Dictionary of World War I, London, Greenwood Press, 1982, p. 102f. He signed the peace treaty with Finland on 29 May 1918 in Vienna.Texts of the Finland \\"Peace\\": With Map (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1918), pp. 47‚Äì48 (German text of treaty with English translation). On 14 September 1918, Baron Buri√°n issued a public appeal for all nations to end the war by diplomatic negotiations. On 5 October, he and the German Chancellor requested President Wilson's participation in peace negotiations on the basis of the Fourteen Points. Within weeks, he recognized the weak state of the Habsburg army and that Germany would not agree to the unconditional surrender demanded by the Allies. He resigned from office on 24 October, realising that nothing could prevent the dissolution of the Habsburg Empire.Pope & Wheal, op. cit. He was succeeded by Count Julius Andr√°ssy the Younger and thus became the penultimate Foreign Minister of the Dual Monarchy. In 1918, Buri√°n was elevated to the rank of Count (Graf). In the same year, he was invested as a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece.Chevaliers de la Toison d'Or He had been bestowed with the Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Stephen in 1910.Magyar Kir√°lyi Szent Istv√°n Rend  Post-war  Count Buri√°n took no active part in diplomacy or politics after the war and spent his remaining years writing his war memoirs, which were published posthumously in German as Drei Jahre aus der Zeit meiner Amtsfuhrung im Kriege in 1923. The English language version, Austria in dissolution; being the personal recollections of Stephan, count Burian, was translated by Brian Lunn, M. A. and was published in 1925.https://archive.org/details/austriaindissolu00step Count Buri√°n died on 20 October 1922 and is buried at the Vienna Central Cemetery. Legacy During the war, Count Buri√°n had sought to balance several sometimes conflicting demands; winning the war, preserving the Austria- Hungary's status and defending Hungary's position within the Dual Monarchy.Spencer C. Tucker & Priscilla Mary Roberts (eds.), Encyclopedia of World War I: A Political, Social, and Military History, Santa Barbara, ABC- CLIO, 2005, p. 243f. Certainly a task that was nothing short of overwhelming. Considered to be serious, legalistic and unimaginative, personal traits that made him a good fit for the bureaucracy and the Imperial Cabinet.'Graf Istv√°n Buri√°n von Rajecz', op. cit. However, his rigidity and pedantry likely made him a less suitable choice at the helm of Austro-Hungarian diplomacy at such a decisive period as World War I with a greater need for flexibility according to one historian.For more on Count Buri√°ns personality traits and his legacy, see Istv√°n Di√≥szegi, 'Au√üenminister Stephan Graf Buri√°n.

The author of the 2014 book,Austro-Hungarian War Aims in the Balkans during World War I, Marvin Benjamin Fried of the London School of Economics and Political Science, offers a similar, but more favourable evaluation. \\"Although he was criticized as being doctrinaire, inflexible, and a Balkanist without a wider purview, Buri√°n had a clear vision to protect Austro-Hungarian prestige, integrity, and power, which he was determined to uphold in face of compounding internal and external pressures.\\" File:Stephan Freiherr von Burian 1915 Charles Scolik.png|Baron Stephan Buri√°n von Rajecz, 23 January 1915 File:Der Minister Stephan Freiherr Burian von Rajez 1915 C.

The approximate location of the Chrysotriklinos is shown in the south, near the seaside Boukoleon Palace and the Pharos light tower. The Chrysotriklinos (, \\"golden reception hall\\", cf. triclinium), Latinized as Chrysotriclinus or Chrysotriclinium, was the main reception and ceremonial hall of the Great Palace of Constantinople from its construction, in the late 6th century, until the 10th century. Its appearance is known only through literary descriptions, chiefly the 10th-century De Ceremoniis, a collection of imperial ceremonies, but, as the chief symbol of imperial power, it inspired the construction of Charlemagne's Palatine Chapel in Aachen.  History and functions  The Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna. Its layout was similar to that of the Chrysotriklinos. The hall is usually attributed to Emperor Justin II (r. 565‚Äì578), with his successor, Tiberius II (r. 578‚Äì582) finishing it and carrying out its decoration.Cormack (2007), p. 304 However, Byzantine sources present conflicting accounts: the Suda encyclopedia attributes the building to Justin I (r. 518‚Äì527), and the Patria of Constantinople to the Emperor Marcian (r. 450‚Äì457), although the latter is usually rejected as unreliable. The historian Joannes Zonaras records that Justin II in fact reconstructed an earlier building, which has been suggested as the Heptaconch Hall of Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565).Kostenec (2008) Following the Byzantine Iconoclasm, it was embellished again under the emperors Michael III (r. 842‚Äì867) and Basil I (r. 866‚Äì886). Unlike the earlier, single-purpose buildings of the Daphne wing of the Great Palace, it combined the functions of throne room for reception and audiences with those of a banquet hall.Cormack (2007), p. 305 Since the later imperial chambers were also attached to it, the hall acquired a central position in the everyday palace ceremonial, especially in the 9th and 10th centuries, to the point that Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (r. 945‚Äì959) calls it simply \\"the palace\\".Cormack (2007), pp. 304‚Äì305 In particular, according to the De Ceremoniis, the Chrysotriklinos served for the reception of foreign embassies, the ceremonial conferring of dignities, as an assembly point for religious festivals and a banquet hall for special feasts, like Easter.Cormack (2007), pp. 305‚Äì306 The Chrysotriklinos thus became the central part of the new Boukoleon Palace, formed when Emperor Nikephoros II (r. 963‚Äì969) enclosed the southern, seaward part of the Great Palace with a wall. From the late 11th century however, the Byzantine emperors began to prefer the Blachernae Palace, in the northwestern corner of the city, as their residence. The Latin emperors (1204‚Äì1261) chiefly used the Boukoleon, and so did, for a time after the recovery of the city in 1261, Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259‚Äì1282) while the Blachernae Palace was being restored. Subsequently the Great Palace was rarely used and gradually fell into decay. The Chrysotriklinos is mentioned for the last time in 1308, although the still-impressive ruins of the Great Palace remained in place until the end of the Byzantine Empire. Description Despite its prominence and frequent mention in Byzantine texts, no full description of it is ever given. From the fragmented literary evidence, the hall appears to have been of octagonal shape crowned by a dome, paralleling other 6th-century buildings like the Church of Sergius and Bacchus in Constantinople and the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna. The roof was supported by 8 arches, which formed kamarai (apses or niches), and pierced by 16 windows. The shape and general features of the Chrysotriklinos were later consciously imitated by Charlemagne in the construction of the Palatine Chapel of the Palace of Aachen, although San Vitale, being located within his realm, provided the immediate architectural model.Fichtenau (1978), p. 68 Interior of the octagonal Palatine Chapel in Aachen, which was modelled on the Chrysotriklinos. In its interior, the imperial throne was placed on the eastern apse (the bƒìma), behind a bronze railing. The northeastern apse was known as the \\"oratory of St Theodore\\". It contained the emperor's crown and a number of holy relics, including the rod of Moses, and also served as a dressing room for the emperor. The southern apse led to the imperial bedroom (koit≈çn), through a silver door put in place by Emperor Constantine VII. The northern apse was known as the Pantheon, a waiting-room for officials, while the northwestern apse, the Diaitarikion, served as a steward's room, and was where the papias of the palace deposed his keys, the symbol of his office, after the ceremonial opening of the hall each morning. The main hall of the Chrysotriklinos was surrounded by a number of annexes and halls: the vestibule known as Tripeton, the Horologion (so named because it probably contained a sundial), the hall of the Kainourgion (\\"New [Hall]\\"), and the halls of the Lausiakos and the Justinianos, both attributed to Justinian II (r. 685‚Äì695 and 705‚Äì711). The Theotokos of the Pharos, the main palace chapel, was also located nearby, to the south or south- east.Kazhdan (1991), pp. 455‚Äì456 Nothing is known of the hall's original, 6th- century decoration. Following the prohibition of human forms under Iconoclasm however, it was redecorated, sometime between 856 and 866, with mosaics in a monumental style.Mango (1986), p. 184 The late 10th-century ambassador Liutprand of Cremona does not hesitate to call it \\"the finest room in the palace\\". Above the imperial throne was placed an image of Christ enthroned, while another over the entrance depicted the Virgin Mary, with Emperor Michael III and the Patriarch Photios nearby. Elsewhere was depicted the heavenly court, with angels, priests and martyrs. The overall decoration was intended to reinforce the analogy between Christ's heavenly court and its Byzantine counterpart on earth. The hall contained valuable furniture, such as the Pentapyrgion (\\"Five Towers\\"), a cupboard built by Emperor Theophilos (r. 829‚Äì842) that displayed precious vases, crowns and other valuable objects.Kazhdan (1991), p. 455, 1625 During imperial banquets, it featured a gilded principal table for thirty high-ranking dignitaries, as well as two to four additional tables for 18 persons each. On occasion, the emperor is described as having his own table, set apart from the rest.Kazhdan (1991), p. 455 The full ceremonial splendor of the hall was reserved for special occasions, such as the banquets for Arab envoys, described in the De Ceremoniis: additional lightning was provided by great chandeliers, imperial regalia, relics and other precious items were brought from various churches and displayed in the apses, while the meal was accompanied by music from two silver and two golden organs, placed in the porch, as well as by the choirs of the Hagia Sophia and the Holy Apostles.Cormack (2007), p. 306 See also *History of Roman and Byzantine domes  References   Sources    *  External links  * 3D reconstruction of the building at the Byzantium 1200 project Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 6th century Category:Great Palace of Constantinople ","title":"Chrysotriklinos"},{"id":"24402710","text":"Tom Dooney (born 3 August 1939) is a New Zealand sprint canoeist who competed in the early 1970s.

He is the first Pakistani to have climbed six eight-thousanders including the world's highest peak Everest (8848m), K2 (8611m), Gasherbrum I (8080m), Gasherbrum II (8034m), Nanga Parbat (8126 m) and Broad Peak (8051m). He is also credited for summiting five of the eight-thousanders without using supplemental oxygen. Contrary to initial reports, Hassan Sadpara clarified that he used supplemental oxygen during his Everest ascent due to bad weather. He died due to cancer on 21 November 2016 in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.  Background Hassan Sadpara was born into a poor family in \\"Sadpara\\", a small village in a remote area of Baltistan, some 7 miles away from Skardu. There was no school during his childhood, so Hassan helped his family as a farmer and a shepherd. His biggest regret in life was that he never went to school; he was proud of providing education to his children. He had four children (3 sons and a daughter). His eldest son Arif is studying for a degree in Master of Business Administration He began his mountaineering career as a high altitude porter in 1993 and became a celebrated climber after conquering Mount Everest. He owned a small shop of used mountaineering equipment in Skardu. It was his dedication and self-confidence that led him to the summits of the world's highest peaks.  Career  He was the second Baltistani to have summited all five of the 8000m peaks of Pakistan, after Nisar Hussain (also of Sadpara village). Unlike most climbers from the West, who are equipped with state-of-the-art climbing gear (and often sponsored by multinational corporations), Hassan Sadpara began his career from scratch, with very few resources, and climbed with whatever gear he could manage to afford. He had worked as a porter for expeditions, including ones led by Koreans and Poles. He ran a shop for used and new mountaineering equipment in the Skardu bazaar. After his successful summit of Mount Everest, he said in an interview that he could summit all the Top 14 mountain peaks if he were sponsored and had requested the Pakistan government or international corporations in his regard. His other dream was to open a mountaineering school in his city so that he and others like him can transfer their knowledge to youth from around the world. Award In 2008, Government of Pakistan awarded him the President‚Äôs Pride of Performance. On 14 August 2019, Government of Pakistan posthumously awarded him the President‚Äôs Pride of Performance for his numerous notable feats that include him being the first Pakistani to have scaled six eight-thousanders which also include the highest peak in the world, Mount Everest. The awards ceremony will be held on 23 March 2020. Mountaineering consultant Hassan Sadpara was a free consultant for new climbers.

It lies on Row River Road between Dorena and Disston. Geography This populated place is located above sea level in the foothills of the Cascade Range. The community is located where the Row River receives the stream that shares its name with the community. Hawley Butte lies just north of Culp Creek and stands tall. History Culp Creek is a tributary stream of the Row River, and was named for settler John Culp just before 1900. A logging camp was established in the area and named Culp Creek Camp, so when a new post office was set up in 1925, it was named Culp Creek after the camp. The community's economy was long driven by the logging industry, including the Bohemia, Inc. sawmill that ran from 1959 until about 1990, just across the river. Bohemia was headquartered in Culp Creek until it was bought by Willamette Industries in 1991. At one time, there were over 20 mills along the Row River. The Oregon, Pacific and Eastern Railway (OP&E;) line was built through Culp Creek in the early 1900s to ship ore, timber, supplies and passengers. Today the former OP&E; line has been converted into a rail trail that opened in 1997, the Row River National Recreation Trail, which ends just past Culp Creek. Culp Creek's only store closed shortly after the closure of the mill. In 1926, Buster Keaton filmed the climax of the silent film The General on the OP&E; line near Culp Creek. Keaton spent $40,000 to build a temporary trestle over the Row River. During the scene, the bridge was set on fire and collapsed just as a locomotive passed over it. The remains of the bridge and locomotive were left in the river for 15 years, until they were removed in 1941 for scrap metal. Culp Creek post office closed in 2009; the community's mail is now addressed to Dorena. Education The area is served by the South Lane School District, which includes the Childs Way Charter School located in Culp Creek. Childs Way is a public charter school serving 35 students in grades six through twelve. Culp Creek Elementary School was consolidated with a school in Dorena in 1989 and closed, with the buildings becoming home to the charter school in 1994. Further reading *Hunter, Wally.

Family He was born at Chisht in a family of Sadaat-i-Maudoodiya. He had two brothers, Khwaja Nizam-ud_Din Moudood and Khwaja Nuqr-ud-Din Shaal Pir Baba Moudood. The three brothers completed their education and Sufi training under the guidance and supervision of their father. It has been narrated that the descendants of Khwaja Sultan Maudood Chishti are not permitted to be initiated by anyone other than the elder Mashaik (the spiritual directors) of their own family. Khwaja Shams-ud_Din Ibrahim and his brother followed this tradition and obtained Khirqa-i-Wilayat-o-Khilafat (the patched authority and leadership) from their own father. They left their home at Chist with a mission to preach and teach the moral and spiritual Islamic rules. While his two brothers stayed at Pashin Quetta, Khwaja Shams-ud-Din Ibrahim traveled on to the valley of Mastung 50 km, away in the south of Quetta valley and selected a hillock called Safaid Bulandi (White height) for his dwelling. He had numerous Khulafa and a vast number of murids. But he himself trained and directly bestowed Khilafat upon his two sons (Khwaja Kalan was sajjada nashin as being the eldest) and four of his grandsons Khwaja Ahmed, Khwaja Ali, Khwaja Sultan Mohammad, Khwaja Ibrahim Dopasi.

Borrowing the elements of a fairy tale, satire and frame story, it has become recognized as one of Caragiale's leading contributions to short prose, and is often described as one of the seminal works written by him during the last decade of his life. While its narrative structure is largely based on Belfagor arcidiavolo, a story by 16th century writer and political thinker Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, Kir Ianulea employs additional elements such as anecdotes to evolve into a social fresco of late 18th-century Wallachia and the Ottoman- ruled Balkans as a whole. Caragiale primarily adapts Machiavelli's theme, which is a fable about the innate unreliability of women, to the realities of the Phanariote epoch, focusing his attention on the interactions between Greeks and Romanians while offering additional insight into the process of acculturation. Structured around its protagonist and named after his main alias, Kir Ianulea recounts how one of the lesser devils is assigned the mission of assessing the evil and negativity of women. In order to accomplish this task, he must live the life of a mortal, and chooses Bucharest as his city of residence. The main part of the story recounts his unhappy marriage to the tyrannical and dishonest Acrivi»õa, his realization that his future among humans was compromised, and his narrow escape from his creditors. The third part shows the devil possessing aristocratic young women as part of a scheme to reward his one-human benefactor, the peasant Negoi»õƒÉ. The narrative ends with a fall-out between Negoi»õƒÉ and Ianulea, and the latter's hasty return to Hell upon being threatened by a potential reunion with Acrivi»õa. Caragiale's tale has been the target of critical interest since its publication, being discussed for its relation to Machiavelli's original story, its particular Neoromantic aesthetics and picturesque elements, its ambivalent take on feminism, as well as the various allusions to concrete social realities. Among the latter are its original insight into the urban culture of Romania in the pre-Westernization period, the recovery of Greek or Turkish influences on the Romanian lexis, and the possible intention on Caragiale's part to depict Ianulea as his alter ego. The story has had its own sizable impact on local literature and the culture of Romania, notably serving to inspire writers such as Radu Cosa»ôu and Radu Macrinici, and being turned into a 1939 operetta by composer Sabin DrƒÉgoi. Plot Introductory episodes Side view of Manuc's Inn The narrativeBased on Kir Ianulea (wikisource) and \\"Kyr Ianulea\\" (translated by Alina C√¢r√¢c), in the Romanian Cultural Institute's Plural Magazine, Nr. 6/2000. Also summarized in Chiciudean (passim), Cioculescu (p.204-207) and Rotiroti (p.23-51). opens with the rally of all devils, as ordered by \\"the Overlord of Hell\\" Dardarot. Probably a replica version of Astaroth,Rotiroti, p.32 the latter confesses being intrigued by the large number of human victims who claim to have sinned only because of women, and indicates that he considers a method for verifying the truth in this claim. Dardarot decides to send \\"the little one\\", Aghiu»õƒÉ (\\"Hell's Bells\\" or \\"Dickens\\"), into an extended investigation on Earth. Although received with displays of fatherly affection by Dardarot, the boy is reluctant to perform such tasks, since, as the narrator informs, he is not on his first mission among humans: previously, he had served an old woman, and forced by her to expend his energy on the futile task of straightening a curly hair. Unimpressed, Dardarot provides him with 100,000 gold coins (the bounty confiscated from a stingy mortal), with the indication that he is to marry and live with his human wife for ten years. Transformed into a handsome young mortal and evicted from Hell by his moody overlord, Aghiu»õƒÉ decides to head for Bucharest, a city with \\"room for parties\\" and many business opportunities. He arrives in the Wallachian capital and books a room at Manuc's Inn, before renting a cluster of townhouses and gardens in Negustori area (the merchants' district, close to Col»õea Hospital). The new guest intrigues Aghiu»õƒÉ's new landlord, who sends the old and cunning housekeeper Marghioala to engage him in conversation and find out his story. Recommending himself as Ianulea \\"of Arvanite stock\\", the young man explains that he is from near Mount Athos (Sf√¢ntagora), in Ottoman Greece, the son of olive tree planters. He provides an elaborate story about his early years, claiming that both his parents died at sea, while taking him on pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem‚Äîvictims of bowel obstruction caused by eating beans after radishes. He recounts having been kept on as a servant and boy seaman by the brutal captain of the ship, and having survived a number of near shipwrecks, and then purchasing his own vessel. After further such adventures, Aghiu»õƒÉ-Ianulea claims, he had been able to amass a fortune and settle in a peaceful country. He also boasts knowledge of several languages without access to formal studies, and claims that his knowledge of Romanian will put Wallachian locals to shame. In the end, Ianulea threatens Marghioala not to share his secret with anyone else, aware that such a warning will only entice her to spread the story around the neighborhood. Ianulea's marriage Col»õea Belfry in 1802 Rumor spreads of Ianulea's fortune and the young man, referred to as a kir (\\"sir\\", from the Greek Œ∫œçœÅ), becomes the center of interest in high society, being invited to events organized by boyars and merchants alike. The details of his account become well-known, his deeds magnified by popular imagination, and, as a consequence, the entire neighborhood is convinced that beans should never be eaten after radishes. Meanwhile, Ianulea begins courting Acrivi»õa, the daughter of unsuccessful trader Hagi CƒÉnu»õƒÉ, who is beautiful and well-proportioned, but has mild esotropia. Although she can offer him no dowry, he decides to marry her, and their wedding is an occasion for Ianulea to display his insatiable taste for luxury. The day after their union, Acrivi»õa (also referred to as Ianuloaia, \\"Ianulea's woman\\") undergoes a sudden change in character from \\"gentle and amendable\\" to \\"tougher and uppity\\", entitling herself master of the household and exercising control over her husband's affairs. She is also increasingly jealous, constantly spying on her husband and ordering her servants to do the same, but does not feel accountable for her own actions. She therefore hosts lavish parties and card game sessions in her husband's house, and irritates him by defaming her own friends. During one such gathering, she informs her guests that a female acquaintance of hers has been fornicating with one of the Wallachian Prince's sons, with a consul of the Russian Empire, and even, after being banished to CƒÉldƒÉru»ôani Monastery, with an Orthodox monk. Acrivi»õa also claims that the unnamed friend plots to \\"break\\" her household by committing adultery with Ianulea. This enrages Ianulea, and the couple begin shouting abuse at each other, while their stunned guests look on. The Ianuleas eventually reconcile and the kir is placated, addressing his wife as parigboria tu kosmu (œÄŒ±œÅŒ∑Œ≥ŒøœÅŒπŒ¨ œÑŒøœÖ Œ∫œåœÉŒºŒøœÖ, \\"consolation of the world\\"). Unbeknown to him, Acrivi»õa has by then begun selling various objects of value in his property to feed her gambling habit. Tricking Ianulea with displays of her affection, she also persuades him to provide a dowry for her two unmarried sisters, as well as capital for her two brothers' respective businesses. Ianulea proceeds to service this and other whims (\\"had she asked for the Col»õea Belfry on a silver platter, kir Ianulea would have brought it to her on a silver platter\\"). As a result, Ianule's fortune is steadily depleted, and he comes to rely on expected proceeds from his investment in the business of his brothers-in-law, while steadily falling into debt. While his credit rating crumbles, Acrivi»õa's itinerant siblings return with bad news: one has lost his ship in front of ƒ∞zmir, the other has been robbed at the Leipzig Trade Fair. Ianulea's only option is to flee Bucharest in a haste and escape his creditors. As he rides past Cu»õitul de Argint Church, he notices that he is being pursued by armed guards, sent by the Bucharest Aga to lock him into a debtors' prison. He abandons his horse and runs up a hill and into a vineyard, pleading with the keeper to provide him with shelter. The latter, who presents himself as Negoi»õƒÉ, reluctantly accepts to do so when Ianulea assures him that his pursuers are not boyars. In exchange for his help, Ianulea lets him on his secret identity, and promises to reward him. He explains: \\"Whenever you hear that the devil's got into a woman, a wife, or a girl, whatever, no matter the place where they live and no matter what station in life they have, you should know it's about me that they're talking. You go right away to the respective house for I won't leave the woman until you chase me out... Naturally that seeing you cure their precious jewel they will offer you a reward\\". Negoi»õƒÉ's fortune The Phanariote court of Wallachia: Prince Nicholas Mavrogenes and his boyars The devil leaves the vineyard, and the focus moves on Negoi»õƒÉ. Catching rumor of a demonic possession in Colentina neighborhood, where a rich girl has come to speak in tongues, shouting and divulging all sorts of embarrassing secrets. The vineyard keeper promises to relieve her suffering in exchange for 100 gold coins, and Ianulea subsequently fulfills his promise. He scolds Negoi»õƒÉ for accepting such a small amount, and informs that he should make his way for Craiova, where they are going to repeat their act with the daughter of a local administrator, the kaymakam. This happens exactly as predicted by the devil, who, upon exiting the girl's body, informs the peasant that he no longer considers himself indebted. As thanks for his service, Negoi»õƒÉ is granted an Oltenian estate and assigned a boyar's title. His blissful relaxation is interrupted abruptly when the kaymakam orders him on mission to Bucharest, where the Phanariote prince's daughter is also being tormented by a demon. Although much troubled, the healer follows princely envoys, and is warmly greeted by the prince (who casually addresses him in Greek, unaware that Negoi»õƒÉ is in reality a local peasant). Nevertheless, the princess strongly rejects the healer's presence, and asks instead for \\"my old man\\", a certain Captain Manoli Ghaiduri. The soldier is immediately sent for, and reveals himself to be the girl's secret love interest, a \\"splendid\\" Greek from the princely guard. While the princess persistently asks Manoli to mangle the intruding healer, the latter thinks of a ruse: suggesting that the girl's illness needs specialized help, he asks permission to consult with Acrivi»õa Ianulea, \\"the widow of the wretch\\", whom he recommends as a better doctor than he. His demand has an instant effect on the princess: instead of shrieking and shouting, she begins cluttering her teeth. Within three days, she is spontaneously relieved of her symptoms. Negoi»õƒÉ does however proceed to Negustori, learning that Acrivi»õa was chased out of her home by the creditors and moved back in with her father. Once there, he claims to be a debtor of Ianulea's, presenting her with 100 gold coins and a deed to the Cu»õitul de Argint vineyard. He manages to intrigue her by suggesting that, should she ever hear of a demon possessing a woman or girl, she is to walk up to the victim, call out parigboria tu kosmu, and recount her longing for Ianulea. She promises to follow his advice, and Negoi»õƒÉ returns to court, before deciding to head out of the city for good. He receives yet more presents from the princely family, as well as emotional thanks from Manoli Ghaiduri. As Negoi»õƒÉ rides out on his way to Oltenia, the devil takes control of another young lady, the daughter of Wallachia's Orthodox Metropolitan. This is Acrivi»õa's opportunity to follow Negoi»õƒÉ's advice, and, as soon as she enters the room, the demon flees in panic. The story ends on Aghiu»õƒÉ's return to Hell, where he requests from Dardarot not to ever accept either Negoi»õƒÉ and Acrivi»õa into Hell, and assign them instead to Heaven: \\"let Saint Peter make up with them as best he can.\\" He also demands and obtains a period of rest to last three centuries, as \\"those little affairs down on earth left me dog-tired.\\" Style, themes and symbolism Context Balkan costume (ca. 1900) Kir Ianulea belongs to the final period in Caragiale's career, during which he was mainly focusing on writing fantasy, moving away from stricter Realism and displaying more interest in the techniques of classical storytelling.Cap-Bun, p.185-187; Vianu, Vol. I, p.313-315 Tatiana-Ana Fluieraru, Le plaisir de conter - le dernier Caragiale, Caragiale et le conte, at Agence universitaire de la Francophonie, R√©seau de chercheurs Litt√©ratures d‚ÄôEnfance; retrieved September 20, 2009 The retired playwright, who lived in voluntary exile to the German Empire between 1905 and his 1912 death, dedicated his final literary contributions to short prose (from novellas to sketch stories), and, according to literary critic »òerban Cioculescu, produced with Kir Ianulea \\"his most significant literary production of that period\\".Cioculescu, p.262 Caragiale is thought by comparatist Mariana Cap-Bun to have grown aware of his own international recognition by 1900-1910: this revelation, Cap-Bun argues, is what prompted him to diversify his approach and seek to contribute works with a universal appeal, primarily by reworking old narrative themes.Cap-Bun, p.185-187 In his 1941 synthesis of literary history, influential critic George CƒÉlinescu also identified Caragiale's maturity with a growing interest in the Balkans and the Levant in general, and in particular with producing \\"artistic Balkanism\\" on the basis of picturesque motifs.CƒÉlinescu, p.502 According to researcher Tatiana-Ana Fluieraru, the change also constituted a radical break with the modern themes of Caragiale's consecrated works, since, as opposed to his traditionalist counterparts, \\"nothing seemed to recommend Ion Luca Caragiale for the rendition of popular stories and anecdotes.\\" She also notes that, in respect to his thematic choices, the writer remained \\"quite cosmopolitan\\", Kir Ianulea being among eight of his last thirty-two stories to choose Levantine subjects over Romanian folkloric sources. Caragiale himself was very pleased with the results of his activity, and called the resulting tales his best works ever.Cap-Bun, p.186 According to literary historian Tudor Vianu, the interval was primarily marked by a Neoromantic and Neoclassical interest in Renaissance and Elizabethan writings, making Caragiale a direct descendant of frame story authors and a disciple of William Shakespeare.Vianu, Vol. I, p.313-315; Vol. II, p.205 In his assessment, Kir Ianulea shares such traits with other Schi»õe noi tales, primarily PastramƒÉ trufanda and Calul dracului (the latter of which he believes to be \\"one of the most perfect stories written in the Romanian language\\").Vianu, Vol. II, p.205 Such writings drew critical attention for subtly merging the supernatural elements into a realistic whole. Calling attention to this special trait, CƒÉlinescu likened Kir Ianulea to Stan PƒÉ»õitul, a prose piece by his contemporary Ion CreangƒÉ, which similarly recounts how the Devil finds refuge in a modern, albeit rural, setting.CƒÉlinescu, p.483 Writing a decade after CƒÉlinescu, philologist »òtefan Cazimir proposed that there is an \\"evolutionary thread\\" going from the fantasy stories by Costache Negruzzi (ca. 1840), through Kir Ianulea, and to the dark prose of Gala Galaction (ca. 1920).»òtefan Cazimir, preface to Nicolae Gane, Teodor V√Ærgolici, Nuvele, Editura de stat pentru literaturƒÉ »ôi artƒÉ, Bucharest, 1959, p.XXV. Another literary historian, George BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu, argued that Kir Ianulea stands alongside two other Schi»õe noi sections (Calul dracului and the Arabian Nights-inspired Abu-Hasan), and together with Ion Minulescu's 1930 volume Ceti»õi-le noaptea (\\"Read Them at Night\\"), as a sample of Romanian literature where \\"the fantasy realm enters human reality [...], being less exploited as a vision, and more as an oddity.\\"George BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu, Fantasticul √Æn literaturƒÉ, Institutul European, Ia»ôi, 2003, p.46. Writing in 2002, researcher Gabriela Chiciudean proposed that Kir Ianulea inaugurated \\"a new territory\\" in Caragiale's work, where the fantasy element was being \\"reduced to the dimensions of the human.\\"Chiciudean, p.398 According to novelist and theater critic Mircea Ghi»õulescu, the story joins up with some other samples of Caragiale's short prose (PastramƒÉ trufanda, but also La hanul lui M√¢njoalƒÉ and O fƒÉclie de Pa»ôte) in anticipating the \\"magic realism\\" of the 1960s Latin American Boom. \\"I. L. Caragiale - azi\\", in Convorbiri Literare, February 2002 Reportedly drafted in three days, the tale is believed to have taken some three weeks to perfect. On January 12, 1909, Caragiale wrote to his friend and biographer Paul Zarifopol that Kir Ianulea was completed, jokingly adding: \\"With God's help, I have finally finished off the devil!\\" The story was soon after published in the Ia»ôi-based magazine Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ.Vianu, Vol. II, p.191 In 1910, it was ultimately included in Caragiale's last anthumous prose collection, Schi»õe noi (\\"New Sketches\\").Cap-Bun, p.185-187; Rotiroti, p.23 Kir Ianulea and Belfagor arcidiavolo Romanian Orthodox mural (Sf√¢ntul Elefterie Vechi, Bucharest) The central theme in Caragiale's story is directly borrowed from Western European Renaissance stories which have the devilish creature Belphegor as their protagonist. A better known Italian-language incarnation of the theme is Niccol√≤ Machiavelli's Belfagor arcidiavolo, published in his 1549 collected works.Cap-Bun, p.187; Chiciudean, p.397; CƒÉlinescu, p.502; Cioculescu, p.203; Rotiroti, p.24sqq Machiavelli's text was however preceded by a shorter version, signed Giovanni Brevio and first printed 1545 as Novella di Belfagorx.Cap-Bun, p.187; Cioculescu, p.203, 262; Rotiroti, p.24-25 In the 19th century, Scottish academic John Colin Dunlop claimed that these writings were all based on a since-lost Renaissance Latin version.Cioculescu, p.203 A separate French-language version was published before in the 17th century, as part of Jean de La Fontaine's Contes.Cap-Bun, p.187; Cioculescu, p.203 Although the story had already been circulating in a Romanian variant (printed in Moldavia), Caragiale's version was primarily based on a French translation from Machiavelli: Nouvelle tr√®s plaisante de l'archidiable Belph√©gor (\\"A Very Enjoyable Novella about the Archdevil Belphegor\\").Cioculescu, p.203-204 However, he also checked other variants, and informed himself about a German-language translation. The Romanian writer was by then an outspoken admirer of the Renaissance thinker, and his various records mention Machiavelli with words of high praise.CƒÉlinescu, p.502; Cioculescu, p.262; Rotiroti, p.24; Trandafir, p.30-31 According to literary historian Constantin Trandafir, the only other person for whom \\"Caragiale reserved as many superlatives\\" is Mihai Eminescu, Romania's national poet and his personal friend.Trandafir, p.31 Like with several other of his Schi»õe noi, Caragiale mentioned and credited his predecessor, first in his correspondence about the unfinished text, and ultimately within the footnotes of the published version.Cap-Bun, p.186-187; Chiciudean, p.397 In one of his messages to Zarifopol, he invited his younger friend to review both texts and see \\"if I have been doing [Machiavelli] justice with the story of my Kir Ianulea.\\" However, he also made a point of claiming that the Belfagor story no longer belonged to its creator: \\"since always, the stories belong to everybody, but the manner of recounting them belongs, no matter what the age, to the raconteur\\". A number of significant thematic and stylistic differences exist between the 1549 story and the 1909 Romanian version, which is almost four times as large as Machiavelli's;Cioculescu, p.205 as noted early on by scholar Mihail Dragomirescu, Caragiale's text grew as a \\"symbolic novel\\". Describing Kir Ianulea and the various other portions of Schi»õe noi as early samples of metafiction, Cap-Bun noted: \\"the new filters were so efficient that one can hardly recognize the new grains growing from the sedimentary beds of the source culture to be responses to the primary texts.\\" Machiavelli's original mixes characters in Ancient Greek myths (the presence of Pluto, Minos and Rhadamanthus) with Jewish and Christian mythology (the heresy of Peor), making Belphegor's mission relate to the supposed evils of womanhood and the morals of medieval Florence.Cioculescu, p.204; Rotiroti, p.25-27, 48-49 In contrast to Belphegor, Caragiale's protagonist is feeble, shy, and, »òerban Cioculescu argues, a \\"sympathetic\\" figure.Cioculescu, p.204 These differences were still deemed insufficient by CƒÉlinescu and by his contemporary, the influential modernist reviewer Eugen Lovinescu. The former judged Kir Ianulea a \\"larger version\\" of Machiavelli's account, while Lovinescu saw it as one of the pieces where Caragiale \\"brought only his storyteller's art, and nothing from his invention\\". Giovanni Rotiroti, an Italian critic and psychoanalyst, argues: \\"The Romanian novella does not move very far away from Machiavelli's, except in matters of lexical richness, as well as in scale and number of pages.\\"Rotiroti, p.28 Evidencing the thematic relationship and the tripartite structure of both stories, Rotiroti concludes: \\"The parallelism between the two novellas is perfect\\".Rotiroti, p.47 He believes that Caragiale imagined a partial translation from Machiavelli, discarding those fragments he identified as weak, and turning the Florentine peculiarities into things that a modern Romanian audience could find alluring.Rotiroti, p.48-51 Tatiana-Ana Fluieraru also proposes that Caragiale's story, unlike his other late pieces which reuse older themes, is an \\"actual reconstruction\\" of the source. Caragial's localized adaptation takes place, according to CƒÉlinescu, during the rule of Prince Nicholas Mavrogenes (1786‚Äì1789), or, in Cioculescu's account: \\"toward the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the next, in still-Phanariote Bucharest, where one finds Manuc's Inn and the Negustori suburb\\". Italian literary historian and Romanist Gino Lupi finds that the Phanariote references touch every aspect of Caragiale's retelling, producing a fresco of historical Bucharest: \\"The episode, which is bare and concise in Belfagor, is shrouded here in particular details which serve to depict Phanariote Bucharest, with its roads, its means of transportation, its costumes. [...] Even if the good devil Kir Ianulea is the usual weak and enamored husband, Acrivi»õa, the greedy and overbearing woman, and Negoi»õƒÉ, the shrewd peasant, are almost entirely for real.\\"Rotiroti, p.24 Tudor Vianu viewed Kir Ianulea as Caragiale's deepest exploration into his favorite object of derision: the Romanian middle class. This middle-class prehistory, Vianu notes, completes his earlier contributions to Romanian drama and comediography, his satire of social customs, and his ridicule of established political opinion.Vianu, Vol. I, p.313 Vianu further noted that the story pinpoints the original middle-class acculturation: \\"the epoch of Greek penetration, when the bases for a large section of the local bourgeoisie were being laid down, creating a political reservoir\\". Writing later, critic Mihai Zamfir also found Kir Ianulea to be one of the first and few works of fiction to make \\"an object of aesthetic contemplation\\" out of the Phanariote age (second only to Nicolae Filimon's celebrated novel Upstarts Old and New). Mihai Zamfir, \\"La √Ænceput a fost Filimon\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 43/2007 Characteristic anecdotes and vocabulary People from Bucharest, 1825 The newer version is also noted for its characteristic offshoots into anecdote, which contribute to the overall difference in size between the source and the replica version. The \\"pleasure of the anecdote\\" is identified by Cioculescu as the basis for Ianulea's detailed account about his origins, including the recipe for avoiding bowel obstruction (described by the critic as \\"an innocent devilish prank\\"). Cioculescu also notes: \\"Caragiale is clearly superior to Machiavelli as a storyteller; the thing responsible for this comfortable handicap is the illustrative power of dialogue, which allows characters to gain contour.\\"Cioculescu, p.206. See also Trandafir, p.31 Gabriela Chiciudean tracked resemblances between Kir Ianulea and the classical frame narratives of the Levant, working the pretext (\\"a subject fulfilling the orders of a king\\") into \\"labyrinthic paths\\".Chiciudean, p.397 A primary method used by Caragiale in rendering depth to his narrative is the recovery of antiquated Romanian lexis, with Phanariote-era archaisms of Turkish or Hellenic origin. In reference to these cultural references, Lupi wrote: \\"The language is rich in the Turkisms and Graecisms of the Phanariote age and greatly contributes in rendering local color to the narrative which [...] is true to historical reality.\\" George CƒÉlinescu focused on the presence of such words throughout Kir Ianulea, proposing that they were used by the author as both a means of adding \\"color\\" and a method for illustrating \\"spiritual nuances\\", concluding: \\"The narrative revolves around hysterical episodes.\\" Among the dated \\"violently southern\\" terms mentioned by CƒÉlinescu are capsoman (\\"stubborn man\\"), daraverƒÉ (\\"business\\"), ipochimen (\\"guy\\"), isnaf (\\"corporation\\"), levent (\\"gentlemanly\\"), proclet (\\"accursed\\"), matuf (\\"senile man\\"), mufluz (\\"bankrupt man\\"), selemet (\\"bankruptcy\\"), techer-mecher (\\"hurriedly\\"), zuliarƒÉ (\\"jealous woman\\") and zumaricale (\\"sweets\\"). In order to add to the authenticity of his novella, Caragiale also contemplated inserting into it several fragments of poems by the late 18th-century author Costache Conachi. Language and its uses plays a relevant part in the plot, providing additional clues and supporting elements. In CƒÉlinescu's opinion, Kir Ianulea differs from Caragiale's early works, where specialized or erroneous language is used for comedic effect; in this case, he argues, the Romanian author attempted not to ridicule his characters, but to reflect their background and origin.CƒÉlinescu, p.502-503 Kir Ianulea therefore records the origin of speech patterns which are natural for 18th-century boyars and traders, and which only become ridiculous at the other end of the Westernization process, where Caragiale's main plays reside: \\"This natural style [of speech] has later fallen through obsolescence into the immediately inferior class, as things will usually happen when the folk dress is concerned.\\"CƒÉlinescu, p.503 This perspective prompted CƒÉlinescu to conclude that \\"Caragiale's genius\\" was in exposing and \\"rehabilitating\\" the earliest stage of a degenerative process, by reflecting the language of the mahala (a suburb or ghetto, commonly stereotyped as an uncivilized and unregulated community). However, he also criticized Caragiale's own belief that texts such as Kir Ianulea were stylistically accomplished because their Romanian was harmonious, believing that \\"spontaneity\\" and \\"naturalism\\" towered over \\"melody\\" throughout the narrative, reaching the point of \\"anti-artistic\\" literature.CƒÉlinescu, p.505 The importance of various other linguistic elements within the narrative has also been highlighted by other researchers of Caragiale's work. An early observation made by Zarifopol, and cited by Cioculescu in agreement with his own arguments, has it that the author introduced references to himself and his Greek-Romanian origins in his portrayal of Aghiu»õƒÉ-Ianulea. This is thought to be the case for the character's stated pride that, despite being a foreigner (an Albanian, in Cioculescu's interpretation), he is both versed in Romanian culture and a polyglot.Cioculescu, p.204-205 The notion that Ianulea is in effect Caragiale's alter ego has subsequently become commonplace among investigators of his work.Rotiroti, p.41 According to Cioculescu: \\"This is, after all, the only place where the author reveals his entirely justified philological pride.\\" Rotiroti theorizes the importance of words in defining the fairy tale's two \\"semantic fields\\". The original and concrete one is Hell, where \\"semantics are organized in pyramid fashion, and ordered [...] as signified of signifiers.\\"Rotiroti, p.31 He adds: \\"Even if the comedic effect [...] springs from an estranging, corporal, obscene, quasi-sexual effect, provided by the strange 'fatherly love'-based relationship between the little devil and his emperor, the body, or better said the various allusions to its components ('ear', 'tail') play a part that undermines with irony the structures attributable to this reality.\\" Also according to Rotiroti, the hierarchy of significance is modified by the earthly episodes within the plot, particularly since Aghiu»õƒÉ's new identity is that of an outsider who holds a succession of roles, and since his foreign name is itself meant to suggest the strangeness of Phanariote times.Rotiroti, p.33-39 The latter attribute, he believes, is illustrated and enhanced by the use of terms directly borrowed from other languages and regularly surfacing throughout the text.Rotiroti, p.40-44 Kir Ianulea and female empowerment Maria, a boyaress of the Dudescu family. Painting by Mihail T√∂pler (ca. 1800) Poet and folklorist Ioan »òerb, who included Caragiale's text in his Antologia basmului cult (\\"The Anthology of Cultured Fairy Tales\\"), placed it in direct comparison not just to Machiavelli's text, but also to an episode in the One Thousand and One Nights and an anecdote in Romanian folklore (collected by Ovidiu B√¢rlea in Hunedoara County).Cioculescu, p.204, 205-206 In »òerb's assessment, the main difference between such prose and Caragiale's text was the latter's \\"progressive tendency\\" and move toward \\"rehabilitating women\\". This perspective was received with reserve by Cioculescu: \\"kir Ianulea's wife, far from suggesting an intent for rehabilitation on Caragiale's part, illustrates the unbearable, exasperating character of a woman who is almost literally infernal. Only the fact that she does not resort to murder imposes the reserve of this 'almost'.\\"Cioculescu, p.206 In addition to her many psychological defects, Cioculescu argues, Caragiale hinted to Acrivi»õa's innate negativity by mentioning her esotropia, exploiting the Romanian tradition according to which distinct marks on one's face are bad omens. Cioculescu wrote: \\"Actually, Caragiale builds his theme without misogynistic hatred, with the euphoria of the storyteller and the playwright who knows how to stage a situation for his characters [...]. But the lack of misogyny does not at all imply that the author, who so well depicts the circumstances of kir Ianulea's exasperation, is an advocate of women. [...] That Acrivi»õa is 'fundamentally evil' is instantly apparent to any reader; that she is not a typical representative of all women is also very correctly assessed.\\"Cioculescu, p.207 Mariana Cap-Bun ranks Acrivi»õa's portrayal as \\"much more evil than the devil\\" alongside several \\"strong female characters\\" in Caragiale's stories and drama, arguing that this motif ultimately owed its inspiration to Shakespeare (and especially to Shakespearean tragedy, which is known to have been treasured by the Romanian author).Cap-Bun, p.195-196 She also finds that, as Caragiale's career drew to a close, this focus too modified to include the \\"excessively cruel and weird\\"‚Äîthe unassailable meanness characterizing Ianuloaia being complemented by the murderous thoughts of Anca in the play NƒÉpasta (1890) and by the violent bouts of hysteria displayed by Ileana, the incestuous protagonist of PƒÉcat (1892).Cap-Bun, p.196 Legacy Interpretations of Caragiale's story continued to be present in cultural debates of the interwar period and beyond. In 1932, Aromanian writer and cultural activist Nicolae Constantin Batzaria contributed an essay tracking down and assessing the Levantine narrative motifs retold by Kir Ianulea. Florentina Tone, \\"Scriitorii de la Adevƒïrul\\" , in AdevƒÉrul, December 30, 2008 The narrative's recovery of the foreign- influenced and often vilified past was viewed with reserve by 1930s nationalists such as philosopher and fantasy author Mircea Eliade, who found the story the most objectionable one among Caragiale's writings. Nicolae Manolescu, \\"Mircea Eliade, 13 martie 1907 - 22 aprilie 1986\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 13/2007 In 1939, composer Sabin DrƒÉgoi completed an operetta version of the story, which premiered at the Romanian Opera in Cluj (it was one of the last Romanian shows to be performed in the city before the Second Vienna Award granted Northern Transylvania to Hungary).Hartmut Gagelmann, Nicolae Bretan, His Life, His Music, Pendragon Press, Hillsdale, 2000, p.62. Kir Ianulea in particular has served to inspire a number of Caragiale's followers among modernist and postmodernist Romanian authors, with new elements being added after the 1989 Revolution. Declaring himself a disciple of Caragiale, writer and humorist Radu Cosa»ôu referred to Kir Ianulea as \\"our father's most accomplished masterpiece\\". Radu Cosa»ôu, \\"Omagiu de 26 ianuarie\\", in Dilema Veche, Vol. III, Nr. 105, January 2006 Also according to Cosa»ôu, Kir Ianulea and CƒÉnu»õƒÉ om sucit are two of Caragiale's most valuable stories in danger of being forgotten by readers, whereas his plays are being turned into \\"giant, intimidating clich√©s.\\" Svetlana C√¢rstean, \\" 'S√Ænt pentru ceea ce se nume»ôte, de la Mozart √Æncoace, drama giocosa' (II). Interviu cu Radu Cosa»ôu\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 67/2001 In 2002, dramatist Radu Macrinici adapted Kir Ianulea into a new play. Titled Un prieten de c√¢nd lumea? (\\"A Friend as Old as Time?\\"), the text merged an intertextual structure borrowed directly from the novella with elements from comedies by Caragiale's uncle Iorgu, as well as with Craii de Curtea-Veche, a celebrated novel by Caragiale's estranged son Mateiu. Gabriela Riegler, \\"Cometa... √Æn drum spre Arnoteni\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 140, October 2002 According to theater critic Gabriela Riegler, Macrinici used this mix to produce an artistic statement about modern depersonalization and \\"Romanian mediocrity\\". Un prieten de c√¢nd lumea? was notably staged in 2002 by Sf√¢ntu Gheorghe's Andrei Mure»ôanu Theater, with Florin Vidamski as Ianulea.

For instance in 1782 alone, Perthshire produced 1.7 million yards of linen worth ¬£81,000. Linen manufacture became by the 1760s a major Scottish industry, second only to agriculture.Brown, P. Hume: History of Scotland, Vol. iii. From the Revolution of 1689 to the Year 1910. (Cambridge University Press, 1911). See page 285. The total value of linen produced throughout Scotland during the year 1770-1771 was ¬£ 632,389. William was born in 1722 in Luncarty just north of Perth, Scotland the fifth child of David Sandeman and his second wife Margaret Ramsay. William with his first wife Christina Fleming had two children. With his second wife Mary Anderson he had a further 14 children (five of whom married five of the 20 children of Hector Turnbull, his bleachfield's business partner). In 1740, Robert and William Sandeman started a weaving business together, though Robert's expanding church duties in Dundee and Edinburgh removed him from the family business.Smith, John Howard: The Perfect Rule of the Christian Religion: A History of Sandemanianism in the Eighteenth Century, SUNY (Albany, NY, 2008). See pages 68 and 81. William was exposed to the Glasite faith after the Perth meeting house first opened in 1733.Cantor, Geoffrey: Michael Faraday, Sandemanian and Scientist: A Study of Science and Religion in the Nineteenth Century, Macmillan (Hampshire, 1991). See page 23. He was later elected an elder of the Perth congregation for several years. In this position, he was expected to lead the congregation in both the worship and community service. As part of his Glasite obligations, he journeyed with his brother Robert in the first attempt to form a London Sandemanian congregation in 1761. When Robert extracted himself from the family business, William found another willing partner in Hector Turnbull. He was buried in the Greyfriars graveyard Perth with the inscription \\"William Sandeman manufacturer Perth and bleacher at Luncarty\\". Linen manufacture and spinning around Perth He manufactured linen in Perth and nearby Luncarty, for instance with an order of 12,000 to 15,000 yards of \\"Soldiers' shirting\\". In 1752 he leveled of bleachfields in Luncarty. By 1790 when William died, the Luncarty bleachfields covered and processed 500,000 yards of cloth annually. Linen spinning in the north of Scotland In the early 1760s, William Sandeman opened two further linen centres: Milntown (now Milton) in Easter Ross and Fortrose on the Black Isle near Inverness. By 1765, these had almost 1000 spinners. Cotton spinning By the 1780s, cotton was replacing linen. In November 1784, Sandeman visited Lancashire cotton mills and Richard Arkwright the inventor who had pioneered cotton-spinning machinery in Derbyshire. Sandeman, Arkwright and others established the Tay River‚Äìpowered cotton mill in Stanley (just north of Luncarty, Perthshire) in 1786/7 with 3200 spindles.

The resulting combinations may be considered decorative art or applied art. The hydrographic process can be used on metal, plastic, glass, hard woods, and various other materials. History The exact origin of the water transfer printing process is unclear. However, the first hydrographic apparatus registered for a US patent was by Motoyasu Nakanishi of Cubic Engineering KK on July 26, 1982. Its abstract reads, \\"[a] printing apparatus provided with a structure which supplies a transcription film into a transcription tub containing a liquid so that the transcription film is kept afloat on the liquid, a structure which makes the liquid flow in a direction in which the film is supplied, and a structure which slantingly immerses an article to be printed into the liquid in the transcription tub from an upstream position to a downstream position of the liquid.\\"  Usage  The water transfer printing process is extensively used to decorate items that range from entire all-terrain vehicles and car dashboards, to small items like bike helmets or other automotive trim. Films can be applied to all types of substrates including plastic, fiberglass, wood, ceramics, and metal. For the most part, if the item can be dipped in water and can be painted using traditional techniques then the hydrographic printing process can be used. Process In the process, the substrate piece to be printed first goes through the entire painting process: surface preparation, priming, painting, and clear coating. After painting but before clear coating, the part is ready to be processed. A polyvinyl alcohol hydrographic film, which has been gravure-printed with the graphic image to be transferred, is carefully placed on the water's surface in the dipping tank. The clear film is water-soluble, and dissolves after applying an activator solution. Once dipping is begun, the surface tension of the water will allow the pattern to curve around any shape. Any remaining residue is then rinsed off thoroughly. The ink adheres to the desired surface and it cannot be washed off easily. It is then allowed to dry. The adhesion is a result of the chemical components of the activator softening the base coat layer and allowing the ink to form a bond with it. One of the most common causes of a failure to achieve adhesion between the two layers is a poorly applied activator. This can be either too much activator being applied or too little.

Plot Spliced is a modern take of H. G. Wells' 1896 science-fiction fantasy, The Island of Doctor Moreau. Spliced marginally distorts Wells' characters in this modern twist by making the mutants the result of genetic experiments created by recombinant DNA rather than Wells' original vivisection process. As with the original story, these experimental results, plus one platypus not in the original story, live on an isolated tropical island that is called \\"Keep Away Island\\" in the cartoon. The mad scientist who created them was arrested and removed by authorities via boat. Left to their own devices, these mutated beasts form a functional society. Characters * Peri (short for failed exPERIment number 13) is a mutant of indeterminate species and purpose. In the episode where Peri happens upon the lab notes concerning his creation, Entree ends up using the pages as toilet paper before Smarty-Smarts can actually read them to determine Peri's purpose. Peri lives in a plane that crashed on the island. Peri is an expert bowler, and he and his best friend Entree developed their trademark game, \\"bucket-stick-fruit-ball.\\" Peri is voiced by Rob Stefaniuk. * Entr√©e (named in reference to the main course of a meal) is Peri's best friend. Entr√©e was created as the perfect food animal, with a cow's udders, a pig body, a chicken's wings and comb, and a shrimp tail. Since he has no legs, Entr√©e \\"walks\\" on his teats, named Nugget, Pokey, Cranky, Commodore Uddersworth, Tina, A.J., Nippocles, and an unnamed eighth which Entr√©e darkly claims speaking its name \\"will give it power.\\" Entree's teats are capable of time travel and light show effects. Fittingly, his home is a giant pizza oven and his bed is a barbecue grill. Entr√®e is evil, in the sense of always seeking instant self-gratification, no matter the cost. Much of the time Entr√©e's selfishness ends up causing more destruction than Mr. Smarty Smarts' intentional evil. Entr√©e is a glutton, loving to gorge on anything, even things that aren't normally edible, but especially mayonnaise. Entr√©e is voiced by Joe Pingue. * Two-legs Joe is a two-legged rhinoceros out of whose high and pointy upper hindquarters a mostly silent bird character named Lord Wingus Eternum grows. Two-Legs Joe is the mayor of the town this society of mutants inhabits, which to his great frustration is constantly being wrecked, burned, and blown-up by the innocent yet highly destructive childlike behavior of Peri and Entree, especially when they play in the doctor's abandoned laboratory. Joe's thing, since he has a rhino's weight upon two massive legs, is stomping. Joe loves to stomp, and he loves to stomp Peri and Entree, and especially Entree, after they destroy his town. Wingus, perched on the high point of Joe's back end, is of the species that was the Doctor's \\"first, and also his best, creation,\\" according to Wingus. It turns out that Two-Legs Joe is actually a mutant growth on Wingus' leg. Such are the hazards of messing with DNA. Two-legs Joe is voiced by Pat McKenna, and Wingus is voiced by Tom McCamus. * Patricia is a female platypus that happened to live on Keep Away Island when the Doctor set up shop. She feels very lonely on Keep Away Island being the only creature that is not spliced. She is an author and has been shown writing a book of poetry as well as the novel: \\"Marzipan Meadows and the Kingdom of Adventure\\". She is a master of the martial art \\"Plat Kwon Do\\". Patricia is voiced by Katie Crown. * Princess Pony Apehands has the head and tail of a pony onto the body of an ape. She is one of the more aggressive mutants, but because she has the mental capacity of a very young girl, she doesn't quite understand how big and strong she is and often hurts others when she is simply trying to play with them or give them a hug. She also has a rather short temper, and will intentionally hurt any mutant who angers her. Her tree house is located deep in the forest and is completely pink inside, and she herself is colored pink and purple. She wears a ballet tutu and slippers and enjoys very girly things. Although she's a girl, her voice is quite masculine and deep. Princess Pony Apehands is voiced by Kedar Brown. * Compuhorse is a horse with a computer implanted. He has very limited animation, for example: He cannot move his lips but speaks similarly to Stephen Hawking, with a synthesized voice through his keyboard. His best friend is Calcupony and his rival is AlphaDonkey. Compuhorse is voiced by Pat McKenna. In the virtual game \\"Cube Whacker\\" he's known as OmegaSteed. OmegaSteed is voiced by Mark Dailey. * Fuzzy Snuggums is a small explorer seeking adventure beyond the island but always fails. He often begins talking with the phrase \\"Expedition note...\\". Long ago, Fuzzy was chosen by the doctor to combat against robots of another scientist from another island, but could not be stopped and was later reassigned for exploration. At that time, his opening sentence was \\"Execution note...\\" (demonstrated in the episode \\"Sgt Snuggums\\"). The Doctor made him indestructible, which is fortunate, considering his exploration attempts usually backfire upon him painfully. Though usually small and cute, Fuzzy's true form personality, which can resurface under extreme circumstances, is that of a giant, musclebound brawler. It was revealed by Lord Wingus in the episode \\"Stompabout\\", that were Joe to never get angry again, Fuzzy would rule the island, enslaving all of its occupants. Fuzzy is voiced by Julie Lemieux. * Mister Smarty Smarts is a villainous dolphin, chimpanzee and a Jack Russell Terrier with a well- developed primate brain, and the main antagonist of the series who attempts to take over the island. He resides in a lair which is located on a slope of the volcano. He is quite egotistical, believing the rest of the island inhabitants to be fools. He also has some cross-dressing tendencies, often looking for an excuse to wear a dress. Mister Smarty Smarts is voiced by Mike Kiss. * Octocat is a combination of a cat and an octopus, who is Mister Smarty Smarts' assistant/minion (although it is shown that they share a romantic relationship of some sort), whom he met after they both crashed their cars together. Unlike the other mutants, she cannot talk, conversing solely in meows, but the others are still able to understand her. Like Fuzzy, she too was created to be a super-soldier, and can also assume a musclebound fighting form. Episodes Broadcast Spliced has aired on a number of channels around the world. The series made its world premiere on Jetix in Latin America on April 20, 2009.

As in One Thousand and One Nights, if the films are good, they live and move on. If the films are boring, they face death in the outback. The journey proves transformative for each of the travelers, but especially for Vishnu who discovers life, love and laughter on the Indian highway.

To do research for the film, he travelled for a year with a transient cinema troupe that showcased different films in rural Rajasthan villages. Benegal completed the first draft of the film's script in only 10 days. The script was written at a difficult period in his career as his other projects had been unsuccessful in finding financial backers. He successfully submitted his screenplay to the L'Atelier screenwriting portion of the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. Abhay Deol signed on to play the role of Vishnu after reading the script which he found \\"really nice, dreamy and humorous.\\" Filming took place in desert areas of the Kutch District of Gujarat and Jaisalmer in Rajasthan. Release Road, Movie premiered on 18 September 2009 at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival.

Guidebook of the Western United States: Part C - The Santa Fe Route, With a Side Trip to Grand Canyon of the Colorado. U.S. Geological Survey. Bulletin 613, 194 pp. (See Plate 3-A) The Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism (KDWPT) is a state cabinet-level agency led by a Secretary of Wildlife and Parks appointed by the Governor of Kansas. The Office of the Secretary is located in Topeka, the state capital of Kansas. A seven-member, bipartisan commission, also appointed by the Governor, advises the Secretary and approves regulations governing outdoor recreation and fish and wildlife resources in Kansas. KDWPT employs approximately 420 full-time employees in five divisions: Executive Services, Administrative Services, Fisheries and Wildlife, Law Enforcement, and Parks. At full staffing, KDWPT Law Enforcement Division (Kansas Game Wardens) is staffed by 83 positions. History Fish and game laws were first organized in the state of Kansas in the form of the Kansas Fish and Game Department in 1905. In 1911, State Fish and Game Department was placed under supervision of the University of Kansas Board of Regents. Another reorganization occurred in 1925 when the Fish and Game Department became the Kansas Forestry, Fish and Game Commission, consisting of three members appointed by the Governor. In 1978, the Forestry part was dropped from the name. The agency became known as the Kansas Fish and Game Commission. Finally in 1987, Governor Mike Hayden signed an executive order merging the State Park and Resources Authority and the Kansas Fish and Game Commission to form the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks. On July 1, 2011, the Division of Travel and Tourism was officially transferred from the Department of Commerce to the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks. The agency is currently known as the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism. Responsibilities The Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism (KDWPT) is responsible for the following state parks: *Cedar Bluff State Park *Cheney State Park *Clinton State Park *Crawford State Park *Cross Timbers State Park *Eisenhower State Park *El Dorado State Park *Elk City State Park *Fall River State Park *Ford County State Park *Glen Elder State Park *Hillsdale State Park *Kanopolis State Park *Kaw River State Park *Lake Scott State Park *Lovewell State Park *Meade State Park *Milford State Park *Mushroom Rock State Park *Perry State Park *Pomona State Park *Prairie Dog State Park *Prairie Spirit Trail State Park *Sand Hills State Park *Tuttle Creek State Park *Webster State Park *Wilson State Park KDWPT is responsible for the following nature preserves and fishing lakes: *Atchison State Fishing Lake *Big Basin Prairie Preserve *Lake Afton *Leavenworth County State Lake *McPherson Valley Wetlands *Maxwell Wildlife Refuge *Mined Land Wildlife Area *Neosho State Fishing Lake *Ottawa State Fishing Lake Kansas Historical Marker at Big Basin Prairie Preserve KDWPT is responsible for patrolling all counties in Kansas: KDWPT employs a number of Kansas Game Wardens (Law Enforcement Division), who are fully certified and commissioned state law enforcement officers, stationed across the state in numerous locations. These Wardens patrol their counties enforcing state law. They specialize in fish/game and boating law enforcement but also routinely deal with other violations that they may encounter. They have full authority to enforce all state statutes and have statewide jurisdiction. Many times KDWPT Game Wardens work with other law enforcement agencies such as the Kansas Highway Patrol and local sheriff or police departments. Game Wardens are usually issued the .45 Auto Glock 21 as the sidearm of choice for the agency. In 2010, the department began issuing the Wardens AR-15 patrol rifles manufactured by Stag Arms, in .223 caliber. Prior to 2010, they were issued military loan/leased M-14 rifles in .308 caliber. Controversy The Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism made international headlines when game warden Tanner Dixson shot an illegally kept pet deer five times and killed it in front of the family who had cared for it for the past 22 months. Taryn Mcgaughey, who cared for Faline the illegally kept deer with her parents, Mark and Kim Mcgaughey, filmed the incident. The video of the Mcgaughey's illegally kept pet callously being slaughtered by Dixson outraged people around the world and resulted in petitions demanding that Tanner Dixson be terminated. However, the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism took no action against Tanner Dixson. KDWPT does not recommend breaking the law, doing such will prevent situations like this from happening. In February 2017, the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism made national headlines again when Game Warden Lynn Koch fired his .45 caliber handgun at the antlers of two buck deer that were entangled together by their antlers to successfully free them. Both deer were saved and this lifesaving action was videoed on a body camera worn by Warden Koch. The video was shared by numerous social media and news outlets. On August 30, 2017, the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism (KDWPT) deployed a fourteen- man team of Game Wardens to Texas to assist with water rescues after hurricane Harvey struck the state. The wardens were equipped with a mobile command trailer and seven boats. Several successful voluntary evacuations were conducted during the deployment.

Services The symbols of Christianity were covered up and they were replaced by the symbols of the Cult of Reason. In the Churches of Reason, there were specially created services that were meant to replace the Christian liturgy. Feast of Reason, at the Notre-Dame For instance, at the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, on November 10, 1793, a special ritual was held for the \\"Feast of Reason\\": the nave had an improvised mountain on which stood a Greek temple dedicated to Philosophy and decorated with busts of philosophers. At the base of the mountain was located an altar dedicated to Reason, in front of which was located a torch of Truth.

Funder (Ph.D., Stanford University 1979) is a psychology professor who has written a number of important textbooks and research articles pertaining to the field of personality psychology. Funder resides as the chair of the Psychology department at the University of California, Riverside. He used to be a past editor of the Journal of Research in Personality, as well as being a former secondary editor of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Funder has been praised for his studies on personality judgment. He had also published research over the attribution theory and the \\"delay of gratification\\".  Research   Researching personality judgment Funder has worked with professor Maynard C. Krueger researching over personality judgments. Their work consisted of trying to decipher which variables and factors result in either accurate or inaccurate personality judgments made from psychologists and \\"every day people\\". The experiment of their research consisted of the two professors retrieving self analyzed information about the patients, judgments created from close acquaintances of the patients, and also recordings of the subject's behaviour using taped cameras. This research led to the understanding that: a \\"good judge\\", a \\"good target\\", a \\"good trait\\", and \\"good information\\" will lead to a more accurate personal judgement.http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~funder/lab/Funder.htm Much of this research follows a Q-sort paradigm. The Riverside Accuracy Project describes the Riverside situation Q-sort and the Riverside behavioral Q-sort.http://rap.ucr.edu  Researching the \\"delay of gratification\\" Funder has also experimented in the area of an idea known as the \\"delay of gratification\\". Funder had performed this experiment with Daryl Bem. To research this idea the two psychologists gathered up a group of children and their parents for a study. The parents were first asked to give personality explanations of their children. Their children were then put into a room sitting in a chair with a bell in front of it. Next, the children were shown two pieces of candy, one being very appetizing and loved by the child, and the second piece of candy given to the child was less liked. The child was then told that if he or she rang the bell an adult will automatically enter the room presenting the candy of less desire, but if he or she waited for someone to come into the room the child would be rewarded with their candy of choice. During this experiment, the personalities of the children willing to wait the longest time for the candy contained an element of being mostly well mannered, obedient, and helpful, but not special and smart. The experiment helped lead Funder to understand that what he actually was testing was the child‚Äôs ability to cooperate with adults, not the child's ability to delay gratification.(pp. 47-48)Funder, D.C.

Privately owned, it is the lake's third largest island after Stansbury Island and Antelope Island. The island has also been known by several other names, including Castle Island, Coffin Island, Disappointment Island, and Miller Island. Human history Fremont Island is named for military leader and explorer John C. Fr√©mont. In April 1848, a year after Mormon pioneers made it to the Salt Lake Valley, Albert Carrington and other pioneers boated around the area and dubbed it ‚ÄúCastle Island‚Äù due to a throne- like shape at the north end of the island. It was first dubbed Fremont Island in 1850, when Capt. Howard Stansbury surveyed the Great Salt Lake. That name eventually stuck. In 1859, two Farmington men placed 153 head of sheep on the island, even calling it ‚ÄúMiller‚Äôs Island‚Äù after one of the men, Dan Miller. In 1862, a grave robber named Jean Baptiste was banished to the island by Brigham Young after Baptiste was arrested for robbing at least 300 graves, according to an article by Yvette D. Isom for History Blazer. After three weeks there, Baptiste escaped. Cattle herders on the island found a heifer that had been killed and tanned for leather, as well as pieces of wood torn from a ranch house on the island. It was believed Baptiste attempted to escape by making a makeshift raft. However, his whereabouts and fate of his breakout attempt were never known. In the early 1870s, the island became a spot for precious metal mining ‚Äî though only 38 claims were made over a two-year span. In 1886, a judge named Uriah J. Wenner moved his family to the island. Wenner was diagnosed with tuberculosis and moved his family to Fremont Island because of its remote location. He and his family remained there until he died in 1891 and was even buried on the island. His wife, Kate, left the island and eventually remarried. When she died in 1942, her ashes were placed next to Uriah's on the island. In 2003 the island was leased by the Barrow Land and Livestock company. Exotic species of animals were brought to the island with the intent to provide unique hunting opportunities. In October 2013 a feral pig was spotted near the Antelope Island causeway. This prompted the state authorities to investigate and find populations of illegal species. The state and owners then proceeded to hunt the remaining animals by air to prevent the potential spread to the mainland. In February 2018 Fremont Island was purchased by a group that included diesel truck entrepreneur David Sparks as an investment. Great Salt Lake conservation groups have expressed concern over potential future plans for the island and have hoped that the State of Utah would acquire the land. Access Fremont Island is privately owned and permission is required for access. The island is accessible via an exposed sand bar when the Great Salt Lake water level is lower than 4,194 feet in elevation. The start point of the land bridge is approximately 1 mile east of the Antelope Island Marina and can be accessed via the Antelope Island causeway. Flora There are certain plant species that occur on Fremont Island, and there is historic evidence that some species that were earlier documented to occur on the island are no longer present. For example, explorers who visited this island in the mid-1800s noted the presence of abundant \\"onions\\" which they identified as Calochortus luteus. However, this name was applied to plants that were later renamed as other species.C. Michael Hogan. 2009. Yellow Mariposa Lily: Calochortus luteus, GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg While it is unlikely that the California endemic C. luteus occurred on Fremont Island, it is clear that some species of Calochortus once present is now extinct.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on September 17, 2009. In the episode, Leslie accidentally takes a stand in favor of same-sex marriage when she holds a marriage for two male penguins during a publicity stunt for the zoo. The episode was written by Norm Hiscock and directed by Paul Feig. The writing staff sought to address more topical issues during the second season, and the same-sex marriage plot was inspired by the real-life pairing of Harry and Pepper, a pair of romantically involved male penguins at the San Francisco Zoo. However, Hiscock said he was focused more strongly on comedy than making a political or social statement. \\"Pawnee Zoo\\" received generally positive reviews, with several commentators claiming it showed improvement and growth compared to the show's first season, which received generally positive reviews. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Pawnee Zoo\\" was watched by 5 million households. Among viewers aged between 18 and 49, the episode was seen by 30 percent fewer viewers than the first season pilot episode. In March 2010, \\"Pawnee Zoo\\" won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Individual Episode. Plot The episode opens with Ron (Nick Offerman) saying to Leslie (Amy Poehler), \\"Here's the situation...\\", prompting her to go into a full rendition of the rap \\"Parents Just Don't Understand\\". Afterward, he tells her someone is on fire at a park and needs immediate assistance. Later, Leslie holds a marriage for two recently acquired penguins to help promote the Pawnee Zoo. Immediately after the marriage, the two penguins begin having sex in front of a crowd of children, who are informed by an adult in the audience that both penguins are actually males. The Bulge, a gay bar in Pawnee, later sends Leslie a wedding cake with two penguins on top to thank her for supporting the gay community. April (Aubrey Plaza) introduces Leslie to her boyfriend Derek (Blake Lee), who himself also has a boyfriend named Ben (Josh Duvendeck), much to Leslie's confusion. They declare her their \\"hero\\" for holding the gay penguin wedding, but Leslie insists it was simply a publicity stunt, not a political statement. Nevertheless, Marcia Langman (Darlene Hunt), a member of the Society for Family Stability Foundation, demands she annul the penguin wedding or resign from the parks department. Ann (Rashida Jones), who has been nursing Mark (Paul Schneider) at the hospital since he fell into the pit, says he has acted much nicer since the incident. Ann also reveals she has broken up with Andy (Chris Pratt). Mark and Leslie kissed before he fell, but both insist they are just friends. Mark tries to ask Ann out, but she declines out of respect for Leslie's friendship. Meanwhile, the Bulge holds a party in Leslie's honor, which she attends along with Tom (Aziz Ansari) to announce she has not taken a political stand. However, she accepts the free drinks they offer her and ends up getting drunk and having a great time. The next day, she is invited to go on the Pawnee Today talk show to discuss her supposed stance on same-sex marriage with Marcia Langman and television host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins). Meanwhile, Andy shows up at Ann's house wearing a fancy suit. He tells her he has matured, gotten an office job and would like to get back together, but Ann declines. The camera follows Andy as he leaves, revealing he is actually living in a tent inside the pit. During the Pawnee Today show, Leslie and Marcia argue fiercely. Leslie insists she has not taken a political position, even after Marcia brings up the recent party at the Bulge. They take several callers, all of whom agree that Leslie should resign. Fed up, Leslie adamantly insists she will not resign, nor will she annul the penguin wedding. Later, she visits Ann and insists that Ann go on a date with Mark. The episode ends with Leslie driving the penguins from the Pawnee Zoo to a zoo in Iowa, where same-sex marriage is legal. Production \\"Pawnee Zoo\\" was directed by Paul Feig. \\"Pawnee Zoo\\" was written by Norm Hiscock and directed by Paul Feig. It originally aired on NBC in the United States on September 17, 2009. It is the first episode to feature Chris Pratt in the title credits as a regular cast member rather than a guest star. The episode addressed the issue of same- sex marriage, typically a controversial social topic for government officials. The staff of Parks and Recreation sought to address more topical issues with the second season episodes, and the writers discussed with series co-creator Michael Schur possible topics for the season debut. They settled on same-sex marriage, which was an issue of particularly high debate at the time, especially in the Los Angeles area. During that discussion, one of the writers brought up the real-life pairing of Harry and Pepper, a pair of romantically involved male penguins at the San Francisco Zoo. The real-life penguins had separated from each other shortly before the episode aired, which resulted in press coverage that the pair \\"broke up\\". Hiscock felt a gay penguin marriage was a good way to connect Leslie's character and profession to the issue, since a zoo would be part of the parks department. He said, \\"It seemed like a funny starting place: a cute zoo promotion that spins out of control.\\" Although the storyline is comedic through its use of penguins in the same-sex marriage, commentators inferred the episode nevertheless takes a position in favor of same-sex marriage. Hiscock said in writing the script, he did not intend to make a strong political or social message, and that the staff was more focused on comedy and developing the Leslie Knope character. However, Hiscock said, \\"What I like is that Leslie doesn't back down from her zoo promotion idea and refuses to annul the wedding. In a weird way she takes a stance.\\" Within a week of the episode's original broadcast, two deleted scenes from \\"Pawnee Zoo\\" were made available on the official Parks and Recreation website. In the first two-and-a-half-minute clip, Tom talks at the penguin wedding about the \\"penguin bachelor party\\" he threw for the birds. Later, Tom and April help prepare Leslie for the Pawnee Today show by impersonating the other guests and berating Leslie without giving her a chance to speak. In the second two-minute clip, Andy gives a tour of his home in the pit, and Leslie changes around Ann's apartment to change the feng shui after her breakup with Andy. Ann also gives Mark brownies to bring to Leslie, which he promptly starts to eat himself. Scenes at the Pawnee Zoo were filmed in Abandoned Zoo Picnic Area in Griffith Park, Los Angeles. Cultural references During the episode's cold open, Leslie performs the third verse of \\"Parents Just Don't Understand\\", a rap song by DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, while Ron tries to tell her about an emergency by saying the song's starting line, \\"Here's the situation\\". April presents a stylized stencil poster of Leslie designed in a similar way to the Barack Obama \\"Hope\\" poster designed by artist Shepard Fairey, with the word \\"Knope\\" instead of \\"Hope\\". While introducing Leslie at a gay bar, April says Leslie is \\"here to recruit you\\", quoting a line from gay rights activist Harvey Milk. At the bar, Leslie sings a karaoke cover of the 2008 Lady Gaga song, \\"Poker Face\\". When Leslie insults Tom's shirt, he defends it by claiming it was featured in the monthly men's magazine, Details. When sarcastically asking if Langman wants her to commit harakiri, Leslie accidentally says \\"harikari,\\" a common mispronunciation of the traditional Japanese cultural term. Reception In its original American broadcast on September 17, 2009, \\"Pawnee Zoo\\" was seen by 5 million households, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received a 2.1 rating among viewers aged between 18 and 49, a 30 percent drop in viewership compared to the first season pilot episode. \\"Pawnee Zoo\\" received generally positive reviews. Time magazine writer James Poniewozik felt the episode \\"beautifully\\" merged the political and personal and improved upon previous episodes by using and balancing its supporting characters. Poniewozik added, \\"'Pawnee Zoo' was spot- on, and had me cracking up beginning to end.\\" Henning Fog of Entertainment Weekly said with \\"Pawnee Zoo\\", the series appeared to be finding its rhythm and starting to distinguish itself from its conceptual spinoff, The Office, which was also created by Parks and Recreation co-creator Greg Daniels. Fog also felt bringing real social issues into the show was a positive direction for the series. Emily Christianson of the Los Angeles Times said \\"Pawnee Zoo\\" improves upon the first season by giving more attention to plot points outside the pit. Christianson particularly enjoyed the scenes with Leslie drunk in the bar, and liked the introduction of the Ann and Mark romance. Los Angeles Times writer Jon Caramanica said the same-sex marriage subplot only alters the show's dynamic \\"a smidge\\", and mainly serves as \\"another opportunity for misadventure for Leslie Knope\\". Caramanica added Poehler is talented, but ill- suited for the goofy Leslie character. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune said the episode appeared to be heading in a better direction than the first season and, regarding Leslie, added \\"You start to root for her this season, instead of wishing she would go away.\\" She also praised the \\"Parents Just Don't Understand\\" rap, comparing it to Poehler's acclaimed rap about then-vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin during a Saturday Night Live sketch. Matt Fowler of IGN said \\"Pawnee Zoo\\" was \\"more solidly entertaining\\" than the entire first season, and made a stronger effort to build up the supporting cast, particularly by establishing a romance between Jones and Schneider. Fowler particularly praised Pratt and voiced excitement for his new subplot. San Francisco Chronicle writer Tim Goodman, who was very critical of the Parks and Recreation first season, said \\"Pawnee Zoo\\" brought new life to the series. Goodman felt the Leslie character was less clueless and ditzy, and that same- sex marriage was \\"perfect fodder\\" for the show. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club commented the \\"Pawnee Zoo\\" plot was strong, the supporting cast performed well and that Poehler feels \\"a lot more comfortable in Knope's skin.\\" But Heisler said it \\"isn't the best thing on tonight.\\" Not all reviews were positive. Verne Gay of Newsday voiced admiration for Parks and Recreation, but found \\"Pawnee Zoo\\" to be \\"flat, forced and messagey\\", and did not make proper use of the supporting cast. He gave the premiere episode a C+ grade. Johnny Firecloud of CraveOnline praised Poehler and the \\"Parents Just Don't Understand\\" opening, but felt cast members like Jones are wasted. He also said there is little chemistry between Jones and Schneider. In March 2010, \\"Pawnee Zoo\\" won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Individual Episode (in a series without a regular LGBT character). It was nominated alongside the ABC drama series Private Practice, the NBC supernatural drama The Listener and the CW drama/horror series Supernatural in the category. DVD release \\"Pawnee Zoo\\", along with the other 23 second season episodes of Parks and Recreation, was released on a four-disc DVD set in the United States on November 30, 2010. The DVD included deleted scenes for each episode.

The British admiral in command of the eastern Indian Ocean, Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew, led a force of four ships of the line, two frigates and brig to the capital of Java at Batavia (later renamed Jakarta), in search of the squadron, which was reported to consist of a number of Dutch ships of the line and several smaller vessels. However the largest Dutch ships had already sailed eastwards towards Griessie over a month earlier, and Pellew only discovered the frigate Phoenix and a number of smaller warships in the bay, all of which were driven ashore by their crews rather than engage Pellew's force. The wrecks were subsequently burnt and Pellew, unaware of the whereabouts of the main Dutch squadron, returned to his base at Madras for the winter. The raid was the third of series of actions intended to eliminate the threat posed to British trade routes by the Dutch squadron: at the Action of 26 July 1806 and the Action of 18 October 1806, British frigates sent on reconnaissance missions to the region succeeded in attacking and capturing two Dutch frigates and a number of other vessels. The raid reduced the effectiveness of Batavia as a Dutch base, but the continued presence of the main Dutch squadron at Griessie concerned Pellew and he led a second operation the following year to complete his defeat of the Dutch. Three years later, with the French driven out of the western Indian Ocean, British forces in the region were strong enough to prepare an expeditionary force against the Dutch East Indies, which effectively ended the war in the east. Background In early 1806, Pellew was relieved by the news that a large French squadron under Rear-Admiral Charles Linois had sailed out of the Indian Ocean and into the Atlantic. The departure of Linois after three years of operations in eastern waters freed Pellew's small squadron based at Madras for operations against the Dutch East Indies. Pellew's particular target was the island of Java, where the principal Dutch squadron and their base at Batavia were located.Gardiner, p. 81 The Dutch Kingdom of Holland was a French client state under Emperor Napoleon's brother Louis Bonaparte and Batavia had been used by Linois in his preparations for the Battle of Pulo Aura, in which a valuable British convoy came under attack, and its position close to the Straits of Malacca threatened British trade with China.Clowes, p. 336 Pellew's departure for the East Indies was delayed by the Vellore Mutiny in the spring, and instead he sent frigates to reconnoitre the situation of the Dutch forces in the region. In July, HMS Greyhound under Captain Edward Elphinstone cruised in the Molucca Islands and captured a Dutch convoy at the Action of 26 July 1806 off Celebes.James, p. 252 Three months later another frigate, HMS Caroline under Captain Peter Rainier, cruised successfully in the Java Sea and managed to capture a Dutch frigate at the Action of 18 October 1806 from the entrance to Batavia harbour.Henderson, p. 79 Shortly before Rainier's engagement, the principal ships of the Dutch squadron, the two ships of the line Pluto and Revolutie, had sailed westwards towards the port of Griessie, Rear-Admiral Hartsinck seeking to divide his forces in preparation for the coming British attack to prevent their complete destruction. Pellew sailed from Madras in the early autumn of 1806, expecting the full Dutch squadron to be present and preparing accordingly with the ship of the line HMS Culloden under Captain Christopher Cole as his flagship, accompanied by HMS Powerful under Captain Robert Plampin, HMS Russell under Captain Thomas Gordon Caulfield and HMS Belliqueux under Captain George Byng. The ships of the line were accompanied by the frigate HMS Terpsichore under Captain Fleetwood Pellew, Admiral Pellew's son, as well as the brig HMS Seaflower under Lieutenant William Fitzwilliam Owen.James, p. 267 Battle By 23 November, Pellew's squadron was approaching the Sunda Strait from the southwest when he encountered the British frigate HMS Sir Francis Drake, which he attached to his force. Three days later, the squadron passed the port of Bantam and seized the Dutch East India Company brig Maria Wilhelmina, continuing on to Batavia during the night. At the approaches to the port, the squadron separated, with the frigates and brig passing between Onrust Island and the shore while the ships of the line took a longer route through deeper water. Although Terpsichore was able to surprise and capture the corvette William near Onrust Island, the main body of the squadron was spotted by Dutch lookouts from a distance, who initially mistook the approaching vessels for a French squadron.Clowes, p. 392 The Dutch officers, led by Captain Vander Sande on the frigate Phoenix, decided that resistance against such a large British squadron was useless: the only warships remaining in the harbour were the Phoenix and six small armed ships, none of which could contend with the approaching British force. In an effort to dissuade the British from pressing their attack, the Dutch captains all drove their vessels ashore, joined by the 22 merchant vessels that were anchored in the harbour. Determined to prevent the Dutch from refloating the grounded ships, Admiral Pellew ordered landing parties to assemble in the boats of his squadron alongside Terpsichore. From there, under distant covering fire from the British frigates, Fleetwood Pellew led the boats against Phoenix, coming under fire from the grounded vessels and gun batteries ashore. Passing through the bombardment from the shoreline, Pellew's men boarded Phoenix to find that the Dutch crew had just abandoned the vessel, scuttling the frigate as they departed. Although now useless as a ship, Phoenix's guns were turned on the other beached vessels to cover the British boats as they spread out to board and burn them. This operation was followed by the destruction of 20 grounded merchant ships in the harbour, although two others were successfully refloated and captured.James, p. 268 In a final act before withdrawing to the squadron offshore, Captain Pellew set fire to the wreck of Phoenix, burning the ship to the waterline. The entire operation was conducted under heavy fire from the shore, but British casualties were only one Royal Marine killed and three men wounded.Clowes, p. 393 Without sufficient troops to attempt a landing at Batavia itself, Admiral Pellew withdrew from the harbour. Preparing his prizes for the return to Madras, he ordered all prisoners taken from the captured and burnt ships returned to shore under condition of parole. The captured William was found to be in such a poor state of repair that it was not worth keeping the corvette and Admiral Pellew ordered the ship burnt. Pellew noted in his official report that Lieutenant Owen, who as senior lieutenant would otherwise have been placed in command, should be recompensed with another command as reward for his services in the engagement. With his preparations complete, Pellew then ordered his squadron to disperse, Culloden sailing to Malacca.Gardiner, p. 82 Aftermath The British raid on Batavia had destroyed 28 vessels. In addition to Phoenix, William and the merchant ships, Pellew's squadron had burnt the 18-gun brigs Aventurier and Patriot, the 14-gun Zee-Ploeg, the 10-gun Arnistein, the 8-gun Johanna Suzanna and the 6-gun Snelheid. Just three ships were captured: two merchant vessels and Maria Wilhelmina. The elimination of the smaller vessels of the Dutch squadron was an important victory for Pellew, leaving only the larger ships of the line at large. These ships were old and in poor condition, limiting the threat they posed to British trade routes. Nevertheless, Pellew returned to the Java Sea in 1807 in search of the warships, destroying them at the Raid on Griessie in November, a year after the success at Batavia. A lack of resources in the region and the threat posed by the French Indian Ocean island bases delayed larger scale British operations against the East Indies until 1810, when a series of invasions rapidly eliminated the remaining Dutch presence in the Pacific.Gardiner, p. 107 Notes References References   *van Maanen, Ron, Preliminary list of Dutch naval vessel built or required in the period 1700-1799.

It is published by the American Roentgen Ray Society (ARRS) and is based in Leesburg, VA. The current editor-in-chief (August 2020) is Andrew B. Rosenkrantz.  History  The publication has undergone several changes throughout its history. The initial publication in 1906 was entitled the American Quarterly of Roentgenology, and was officially associated with the ARRS in 1909. In 1913, journal was renamed the American Journal of Roentgenology, and publication frequency was increased to a monthly basis under editor Preston M. Hickey. Hickey would remain editor-in-chief for approximately 10 years, and became a pioneering voice for evolution of radiologic education and reporting. With the advent of radiation therapy and nuclear medicine under the auspices of radiology, there was a period from 1920 to 1970s during which the ARRS began publishing articles on topics of radiation oncology and nuclear medicine in addition to diagnostic radiology. Accordingly, the journal was renamed American Journal of Roentgenology and Radium Therapy in 1922, and later the American Journal of Roentgenology, Radium Therapy, and Nuclear Medicine. Finally in 1976, the journal was once again renamed back to American Journal of Roentgenology at which time mandatory peer-review was implemented.

The original building was a Kirkbride Plan and the current building has a similar floor plan with male and female wings extending out from the main building.http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~asylums/medlake_wa/index.html A facility for the mentally ill in Washington State, it was commissioned by the Territorial Legislature in 1886 to ease overcrowding at Western State Hospital, which at the time was the only hospital for the mentally ill in the Washington Territory. Over the years, the hospital has been the subject of a number of scandals regarding the treatment of its patients and the quality and effectiveness of the care provided. As a result of these scandals, the vast increase in scientific and medical understanding of mental illnesses and the methodologies of effective treatment thereof, the hospital has undergone numerous transitions in the past century. The hospital continues to operate today as a treatment hospital, far from its origins as a state mandated custodial institution and more in line with the modern understanding of how best to treat mental illnesses and disorders. It is accredited with The Joint Commission (TJC). History In 1886, the Territorial Legislature authorized a Board of Commissioners to select a site for the establishment of a new hospital. After deliberation and hearings, the legislature designated Medical Lake as the site of the new hospital. This site was chosen for a number of reasons: it was on three rail lines and in close proximity to the train station in Cheney; citizens donated the land for the site; it had an ample drinking water supply, and at the time the lake was widely believed to have healing properties. By March 1891, the first building of the hospital was completed. At four stories tall, 400 feet long, and made of bright red brick, the Eastern State Hospital for the Insane (as it was then known) was hailed as \\"one of the most handsome and imposing buildings in the state\\" and \\"one of the finest structures on the Pacific coast\\" by observers. After staff hiring, the first patients arrived in May and the hospital has been in operation ever since. Report of the Board of Commissioners Board of Commissioners Report selecting a site for and authorizing the construction of Eastern State Hospital In 1887, following a territorial legislative session in Olympia, Thomas H. Cavanaugh and Secretary Charles W. Clarke issued their summary report, the Report of the Board of Commissioners Appointed to Select a Location for A Hospital for the Insane in Eastern Washington to the Legislative Assembly. The report details the search and evaluation for a site to construct an insane asylum in eastern Washington State by the Board of Commissioners and how Medical Lake was the preferred location. The report is addressed to the Council and House of Representatives of the Territory of Washington. There were many good reasons for the Board to choose Medical Lake as the site of their new hospital. The land itself had much to offer, with a permanent spring, an abundance of building materials such as timber and granite, and numerous terraces for building sites. The spring would be used as clean drinking water while the nearby lake would be used for lavatory and medical uses. In addition to this, the citizens of Medical Lake proposed to donate a quarter section of the land should the hospital be built at the Medical Lake site, quoted at the time $100 an acre. Other sites were visited by the Board in the towns of Yakima, Walla Walla, Waitsburg, Dayton, Pomeroy, and Colfax, none of which were considered as desirable as the site at Medical Lake. The Yakima site was quoted at $50 an acre while the Walla Walla, Waitsburg, Dayton, Pomeroy, and Colfax sites were between $10‚Äì25 an acre. Medical Lake was more expensive and in 1887 relatively inaccessible to major railways. However, this was not reason enough for commissioners T.J. Smith, G.J. Hill, and Charles W. Clarke to think of any other location as the best suited to construct the hospital. Evolution of treatment procedures The approach to psychiatric care at Eastern State Hospital has changed over time, reflecting the changes in understanding of mental health in the more than 100 years since the hospital‚Äôs founding. The different approaches to psychiatric care at the hospital can be divided into four distinct phases: Custodial Care phase, the \\"Patient-is-problem\\" phase, the Chemotherapy phase, and the current \\"Community Mental Health Movement\\" phase. Custodial care The custodial care phase represents the first five decades of the hospital‚Äôs operations. The main emphasis of this phase was the isolation or \\"asylum\\" of patients, separating them physically from the world to simplify patient lives and to protect those in the community. It also protected them from the community, as mental illness was heavily ostracized and stigmatized in those days; though there is still a significant stigma today, it is much less than around the start of the 20th century. At this point in history there was little to no understanding of the nature of mental illness; considered causes of illness at the time were \\"age, tobacco, constipation, whiskey, and morphia[sic],\\" and any person seen as problematic (alcoholics, the mentally retarded, those suffering depression, criminals) were placed in the hospital. Treatments were targeted at symptoms, and many of those treatments were completely ineffective. Such treatments included religious actions (prayer, exorcisms, forced religious study, etc.), physical restraint, and other punishments. The hospital suffered severe overcrowding and was very understaffed in this period, with a single attendant being responsible for 40-50 patients, working in 12-hour shifts, with a total of 800 patients in the original building. Over time, 22 new buildings would be added to the hospital complex and the population peaked at 2,274 in 1954. Many of these new buildings were the result of Works Project Administration spending during the Depression, which sought to both create jobs and to ease the overcrowding. A significant development in therapy came in the 1930s. Daisy Lewis, an attendant, gave an insulin shot to a woman who didn‚Äôt recognize her husband nor daughter and was \\"completely oblivious to reality.\\" The effects wore off shortly and treatment was repeated, but it gave hope that there was something that could be done for patients. Despite the positive results such treatments had for some, they had numerous negative effects on patient health. Different kinds of convulsive therapies, or \\"shock therapies\\" (insulin shock, metrazol shock, electroshock), were used for all manner of patients, as these were the only treatments with any consistent efficacy yet discovered (though they were only truly effective on a small number). The overuse is clear in the hospital‚Äôs statement: \\"During a two year period in the early 1950s, over 1,100 patients received one of the convulsive therapies; altogether, about 15,000 treatments were administered.\\" In World War II, treatments turned into \\"work therapy\\" for all those not residing in locked wards, or roughly 80% of the total patient population. Patients worked between two and eight hours a day on a variety of tasks, including baking, farming, sewing, gardening, cobbling, landscaping, housekeeping, cooking, and many others. After a day‚Äôs work, patients received either group or individual counseling; this counseling focused on correcting perceived moral or religious deficiencies, which were seen as the cause of a \\"demented\\" condition. This period of hospital history (as in many other mental health facilities) is regarded as a low point, and even hospital officials have stated that it \\"must have been a frightening place through [those] decades.\\" Through the first five decades of the hospital‚Äôs history, the number of patients rose steadily, and most of them never left the hospital. Concerns were raised when so many patients were being admitted, and so few were being reintegrated into the community; the effectiveness of any treatment was cast into severe doubt. \\"Patient-is-problem\\" phase Such concerns over the hospital‚Äôs retention rates of patients led to the next phase of treatment styles at the hospital, the \\"patient-is-problem\\" phase, from 1941 to 1954. Treatment began to incorporate Freudian theory of the causes of mental illness, and focused on an individual patient‚Äôs thought processes, formative experiences, and genetic factors. A significant factor in this approach came from returning World War II soldiers and medics, who had front line experience of mental trauma caused by war. On the front lines, these groups developed methods for first-response, short-term crisis therapy for those in distress to allow them to return to the battlefield. This interest in understanding mental illnesses increased as group therapies were found to be effective, and research by military medical personnel and social workers increased through both World War II and the Korean War (1951‚Äì1954). Chemotherapy phase The third reworking of hospital treatment policies began in the mid-1950s, ushered in by the new availability of psychotropic drugs. While some saw the new use of pills to treat mental illness as little more than \\"chemical strait jackets,\\" they allowed a large number of patients to be released and being their reintegration into the community. As the hospital‚Äôs 12th superintendent Dr. G. Lee Sandritter stated, \\"as long as we hang on to a patient, he won‚Äôt get well.\\" Thus, the new policy was for patients to be kept in the hospital only as long as medically necessary before being released and reintegrated. Sandritter was fired in his 2nd year amidst much controversy. The Spokesman Review had run a number of articles alleging misconduct at the hospital under his supervision, including runaways and sexual misconduct between staff and patients. It is unclear how much of these allegations were based in fact, and how many were generated by the hysteria over Sandritter‚Äôs loosening of hospital policies confining patients; the primary sources of the accusations were \\"disgruntled employees,\\" according to official hospital literature. These liberalizing policies were continued by Sandritter‚Äôs successor, Dr. Harris Bunnell. A volunteer program was started to help integrate the hospital with the public, and in 1965 over 2400 visitors came to the hospital, helping to lessen the \\"asylum\\" stigma that had plagued it for so long. The patient population was also falling dramatically; by 1970, the hospital was at a quarter of its peak 1950s numbers at around 500 patients, a number not seen by the hospital since 1907. Treatment responsibilities for released patients were delegated to Community Mental Health centers, which were established locally under guidelines established by federal legislation. The Community Mental Health Movement This phase, which continues today, was catalyzed by new legislation in Congress. The Mental Health Study Act, passed by Congress in 1955, established the Joint Commission on Mental Illness and Mental Health to evaluate mental health treatment in the United States. The commission‚Äôs recommendations for reforms were incorporated, in large part into the 1963 Community Mental Health Act. This act provided federal grants to state and municipal governments to establish community mental health centers to deal with outpatient treatment of the mentally ill. Many were not accepting of the newly released mentally ill in their communities, and discrimination was fairly common and institutional: released patients could not vote nor hold driver‚Äôs licenses, despite having been declared \\"sane.\\" This changed in 1974, when the Washington State Legislature passed laws guaranteeing equal constitutional rights for patients. Treatment of the mentally ill today is increasingly done on an outpatient basis, and ESH focuses predominantly on more severe cases, as well as providing a space for group therapy and workshops. The hospital today has room for 312 patients, and has roughly 700 staff; nearly 100 patients are admitted on a monthly basis.  Notable Escapes  As is the case with any mental institution, patients escaping from the hospital employees‚Äô control are a significant concern. Throughout the years of Eastern State Hospital's existence there have been infrequent escapes by mentally ill patients.  Phillip A. Paul  The most recent, and perhaps most famous, escape from Eastern State Hospital occurred on September 17, 2009. Hospital employees took a group of 31 forensic ward patients on a supervised field trip to the Spokane County Interstate Fair. One of these patients, 47-year-old Phillip A. Paul of Goldendale, Washington, wandered away from the group and could not be located by Hospital staff. The escape led to widespread distress because of Paul's criminal past- a paranoid schizophrenic, Paul was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the brutal 1987 murder of a Sunnyside, Washington woman. Yet, supervisors on the field trip waited two hours before alerting authorities of Paul's escape. During an extensive search of the fairgrounds immediately following the notification of the escape deputies concluded Paul had already left the premises. While the fairgrounds were not shut down during the search, upon hearing of the escape fairgoers were angered by the decision to bring a criminally insane patient to such a populated community event. Paul was found and taken back into custody just outside Goldendale three days after escaping the fair. Spokane County Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich said Paul conned a friend into giving him a ride from Spokane to Goldendale. Three Spokane deputies made the arrest after Paul tried to hitch a ride in their undercover and unmarked van. At the time of his arrest, Paul was reportedly carrying a backpack with food, clothing and personal items as well as a guitar, sleeping bag and hand scythe. Aftermath Outrage ensued amongst community members and law enforcement officials in the area because they claimed a man with Paul's criminal history and condition should not be permitted to go on the hospital field trips. In fact, the escape during the Spokane County Interstate Fair was not Paul's first escape from the hospital. In 1990, Paul escaped from Eastern State Hospital and upon his detainment assaulted a Spokane County sheriff's deputy. Paul was charged with first-degree escape and second-degree assault for the incident. Ironically, the deputy Paul assaulted during his first escape was also one of the deputies who later detained him during his second escape. But while the worry and angst was alleviated with Paul's recapture, the anger and bewilderment of community members and authorities remained center stage. For their part, Eastern State Hospital officials justified its decision to allow for Paul's inclusion in the field trip by pointing to his recent behavior. Then-head of Eastern State Hospital Hal Wilson called Paul \\"a fairly model patient\\" and claimed \\"he's not acted out in any way\\". This did little to alleviate the seriousness of the matter however. Furthermore, state records show the staff at Eastern State Hospital has been supervising community outings for criminally committed patients for several years because it allows them to observe how the patient interacts with society. In the aftermath of Paul's escape, there was much fallout for Eastern State Hospital. First, Wilson resigned from his post as the Chief Executive Officer of the hospital. In his resignation letter to Susan Dreyfus, the secretary of the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, Wilson explained, \\"hopefully, this will move to help signify that a change in leadership at the hospital is being taken and that new vision and direction can be brought forth to lead the hospital\\" (\\"News Release: Eastern State Hospital CEO\\") In addition, seven undisclosed Eastern State Hospital employees were disciplined for Paul's escape. Richard Kellogg, director of the Washington State Division of Mental Health Systems, said none of the seven employees were fired for their role in the incident, however. Kellogg claimed the punishments stem from failures by the employees to properly assess patient risks and for the untimely manner in which employees contacted authorities following the escape. Finally, Kellogg and Dreyfus vowed to overhaul the group community outings from the forensic ward, limiting groups to four people and following strict restrictions. In all, while escapes have not been a major problem throughout the history of Eastern State Hospital, Paul's escape in 2009 sent shockwaves throughout Washington's mental health community, law enforcement officers, and the community as a whole. Steps have been taken to try to limit or prevent future escape attempts from the state's mental health institutions. Some clarification should be made regarding the term \\"escape\\" as it relates to Eastern State Hospital. Patients are categorized by their level of response to treatment and by the type of commitment they are serving. A civil commitment or a criminal commitment. The patients that are part of a civil commitment are allowed privileges such as, open campus, short term unsupervised leaves and more. Depending on the level assigned a patient gains more freedom. While the term \\"Escape\\" may be used infrequently as it relates to the hospital, \\"Walk Away's\\" happen on a regular basis. Patients do walk away from Eastern and local Law Enforcement are requested to search for them. Patients at Eastern as part of a criminal commitment are in a secure \\"Forensic Services Unit\\" the term \\"escape\\" perhaps fits these patients better, Patients in a civil commitment do walk away regularly. Most patients of Eastern have been placed there because they are a danger to themselves, however often those civil commitments include patients that are a danger to others as well. Post-millennium  As of 2016, Eastern State Hospital has a patient capacity of 287 beds. These are broken up into three different units: 91 in the Adult Psychiatric Unit, 101 in the Geropsychiatric Unit, and 95 in the Forensic Services Unit. Each of the three units maintains a very specific function. The Adult Psychiatric Unit serves adults who are experiencing acute or chronic psychiatric illness. The Geropsychiatric Unit serves adults age 50 and over and those who have special medical and/or physical needs. The Forensic Services Unit provides evaluation and treatment for adults referred to the hospital by the judicial system and runs the Community Competency Evaluation Program. Additionally, the hospital seeks to embed itself in the local community. It does so in a variety of ways. For instance, Eastern State Hospital partners with several colleges and universities in the region to offer graduate program experiences for students. It also holds occasional workshops and allows visitors on any given day, in compliance with its visiting hours and requirements (Washington State, \\"Eastern State Hospital\\").

He became a member of the Nigerian Senate in 2007. Background George Thompson Sekibo was born on 1 April 1957 in Ogu Town, Rivers State. He obtained a B. Tech Architecture from Rivers State University of Science and Technology, Port Harcourt, and a M. Eng. in Environmental Engineering from the University of Port Harcourt, Choba. He was Chairman/Prefect in some Local Governments in the Rivers State area from 1988 ‚Äì 1989. He was the organizing secretary of the Democratic Party of Nigeria in Rivers State in 1997 ‚Äì 1998, Special Adviser on Projects and Special Adviser on works to the Governor of Rivers State 1999 ‚Äì 2002. George Thompson Sekibo was elected to the National House of Representatives for the Ogu/Bolo/Okrika constituency of Rivers State for the 2003 ‚Äì 2007 term. Senate career George Thompson Sekibo was elected to the Senate in 2007 as a Senator representing Rivers East. His 2007 election was disputed, but in December 2008 was upheld by the Court of Appeal. He was appointed to Senate committees on Niger Delta, Gas, Federal Character & Inter-Government Affairs, Environment, Downstream Petroleum and Commerce. In January 2008, Sekibo raised concern that the Rivers State governor Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi was potentially causing tension between the Okrika and Ikwerre communities by his ultimatum to the Okrika community to produce warlord Ateke Tom. He advised the governor to use his legal security apparatus to apprehend Ateke. However, in July 2009, Senator Sekibo affirmed his support for governor Amaechi. In January 2009, Senator Sekibo voiced the strained relations between the senate and president Umaru Musa Yar'Adua, raising a point of order when the president did not formally inform the senate that he was proceeding on a two-week vacation, and on that basis questioning whether the senate should recognize Vice President Goodluck Jonathan as the acting president. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Solid Minerals Sekibo severely criticized the Solid Minerals Ministry for failing to release $10 million granted by the World Bank to assist artisanal miners in the country. In February 2009, Senator Sekibo sponsored a probe into misuse of the Development of Natural Resources Fund (DNRF) and related funds operated without National Assembly (NASS) approval. In April 2009, Sekibo's Committee on Solid Minerals said that Julius Berger Nigeria may have been illegally exporting granites from quarry sites in Ebonyi State. In May 2009, a row broke out when it was revealed that ten Senate members had been on an all- expense-paid trip to Ghana, with the implication that they were being influenced by Petroleum and Gas producers. The members were referred to the Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions for investigation following a point of order raised by Senator Sekibo. Sekibo ran for reelection as Rivers East Senator on the PDP ticket in April 2011. He won with 198,414 votes, easily defeating Lasbry Amadi of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) who gained 58,182 votes and Chigozie Orlu of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) with 13,605 votes.

Other literary works which have served as the basis for operas on the Crusades include: 1735 mock epic poem, Il Ricciardetto; Dormont De Belloy's 1777 play, Gabrielle de Vergy;De Belloy's play derives in turn from a series of medieval legends, most notably the 13th-century Roman du ch√¢telan de Courcy et de la dame de Fayel by Jakemon Sakesep and has no basis in historical fact. Jean-Antoine-Marie Monperlier's 1813 play Les Chevaliers de Malte (The Knights of Malta); August von Kotzebue's 1820 play Die Kreuzfahrer (The Crusaders); Sir Walter Scott's 1825 novel, The Talisman; and Tommaso Grossi's 1826 epic poem I Lombardi alla prima crociata (The Lombards in the First Crusade). Tasso's La Gerusalemme liberata At least one hundred operas have been inspired by Tasso's La Gerusalemme liberata (Jerusalem Delivered).Siberry (2003) p. 288 He began writing it while still a schoolboy and finished it in 1575 when he was thirty. The first complete editions were published in Parma and Ferrara in 1581. The main characters are a mixture of historical figures and ones invented by Tasso.The source for the character descriptions is Tasso (2000) Of the poem's main characters below, the invented Rinaldo and Armida, are the most frequent operatic characters. Their love story, primarily recounted in Canto XVI, is one of the most famous episodes in La Gerusalemme liberata and has alone served as the theme for over fifty operasJellinek (1994) p. 354 as well as many paintings.See for example, Boucher's Renaud et Armide, Bellucci's Rinaldo e Armida, Poussin's Renaud et Armide, Conca's Rinaldo e Armida, Fragonard's Rinaldo in the Garden of Armida, and multiple treatments of the subject by Tiepolo Apart from Tancredi, the historically based characters tend to have relatively minor roles in operas based on the poem. Goffredo is Godfrey of Bouillon, one of the military leaders of the First Crusade and later ruler of Jerusalem. (The original title of La Gerusalemme liberata was Il Goffredo.) Pietro l'eremita is Peter the Hermit, the spiritual leader of The People's Crusade. Tancredi is Tancred, Prince of Galilee, a Norman knight who became the ruler of Galilee and Antioch. He and Gaston IV of B√©arn claimed to be the first Crusaders to enter Jerusalem when the city fell on 15 July 1099. In the poem, Tancredi falls in love with Clorinda and in turn is loved by both Clorinda and Erminia.Note that this is not the same person as the title character in Rossini's 1813 opera Tancredi. Rossini's opera is based on Voltaire's 1759 play, Tancr√®de, which is set in Syracuse during the years leading up to the First Crusade. See Jellinek (1994) p. 61 Rinaldo falls under Armida's spell in a painting by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, one of his many works inspired by their story. Rinaldo (fictional) is a valiant Christian knight. In the story, he is an ancestor of the House of Este, a compliment paid to Tasso's patron Alfonso II d'Este the Duke of Ferrara. Rinaldo shares the name (but not the identity) of an earlier Christian knight, Rinaldo di Montalbano who was a character in Ariosto's Orlando Furioso. After escaping Armida's enchantment, he seeks penance on the Mount of Olives for having abandoned his Christian duty for love and participates in the final assault on Jerusalem. Armida (fictional) is a beautiful highborn woman from Damascus and a sorceress. Her grandfather (Idraote), the ruler of the city was also a sorcerer. She uses her beauty and her magic to enchant the Christian knights and sow discord amongst them. After spiriting Rinaldo away to her magic isle, they fall in love. When Rinaldo comes to his senses and leaves her to return to battle, she becomes suicidal. Her character has elements of both Homer's Circe and Ariosto's Alcina. Erminia (fictional) is the daughter of the Muslim King of Antioch (Cassano) who was killed by the Crusaders when they conquered the city. Tancredi nevertheless treats her with honour and protects her, causing Erminia to fall in love with him. When Tancredi is wounded in battle and on the verge of death, she abandons her people and comes over to the Christian side, curing him with special herbs. Clorinda (fictional) is a warrior-princess, fighting on the side of the Muslims. Unbeknownst to her, she is actually the daughter of the Christian King of Ethiopia. She was born white, an extraordinary fact attributed to her having been conceived beneath a painting of Saint George. Fearing that the dark-skinned King would not believe this explanation, Clorinda's mother had the child taken to Egypt by her servant (Arsete), where she was raised a Muslim. Clorinda and Tancredi fall in love, but ultimately meet in battle during the final assault on Jerusalem, although they don't recognize each other beneath their armour. Clorinda is killed by Tancredi, and dying in his arms asks him to baptize her. Sofronia and Olindo (fictional) are young Christian lovers living in Jerusalem before its fall to the Crusaders. When the Muslim ruler of the city, Aladino, orders a persecution the Christians, they are sent for execution. Clorinda takes pity on them and rescues them as they are about to be burnt at the stake. Argante (fictional) is a hot-headed Saracen warrior and an emissary of the King of Egypt and King Aladino. He is eventually slain by Tancredi. Ismene (fictional) is a powerful sorcerer in the service of King Aladino. At one point Ismene convinces Aladino to steal an icon of the Virgin Mary and hang it in a mosque, where he can cast a spell on it. Voltaire's Za√Øre Voltaire, the author of Za√Øre. In addition to his many other plays which have inspired opera librettists, Voltaire also wrote several libretti himself, most notably that for Rameau's Le temple de la Gloire. Voltaire's Za√Øre (The Tragedy of Zara) was given its first public performance on 13 August 1732 by the Com√©die fran√ßaise at the Th√©√¢tre de la rue des Foss√©s Saint-Germain. It was a great success with the Paris audiences and marked a turning away from tragedies caused by a fatal flaw in the protagonist's character to ones based on pathos. The tragic fate of its heroine is caused not through any fault of her own, but by the jealousy of her lover and the intolerance of her fellow Christians.For more on the parallels drawn between sexual jealousy and religious fanaticism in the play, see Weber (2004) Voltaire ostensibly set the play in the \\"Epoch of Saint Louis\\". However, the plot and characters are largely fiction. The historical characters alluded to, members of the Lusignan and Ch√¢tillon families, were related to events of the Crusades but not alive at the time of Louis IX.Pike (1936) pp. 436‚Äì439 The characters' names in the original French are: *Orosmane, (Osman) the Sultan of Jerusalem *Za√Øre, (Zara) a Christian slave kidnapped as a baby when Cesarea was sacked by the Muslim armies and the lover of Orosamane *N√©restan, a French knight, and unbeknownst to Za√Øre, her brother *Lusignan, a descendant of the Christian princes of Jerusalem, now a prisoner of the Sultan and, unbeknownst to Za√Øre, her father *Fatime, (Fatima) a slave girl and Za√Øre's friend *Ch√¢tillon, a French knight and comrade of N√©restan *Corasmin and M√©l√©dor, officers of the Sultan *Un esclave, an unnamed slave The play's melodramatic plot and a setting that appealed to the orientalism in vogue in late-18th- and early-19th-century Europe made it popular with opera composers. Za√Øre has been the inspiration for at least thirteen operas.Carlson (1998) p. 44 One of the earliest operatic adaptations was Peter Winter's Zaire which premiered in 1805 at The King's Theatre in London with the famous Italian contralto, Giuseppina Grassini, in the title role.Stafford (1830) p. 330 Bellini's 1829 Zaira, also based on the play, was expressly written for the inauguration of the Teatro Regio di Parma but was a failure on the opening night and has been rarely performed since then. Johann Andreas Schachtner's libretto for Mozart's unfinished opera Za√Øde, was based largely on a 1778 singspiel, The Seraglio, or The Unexpected Reunion of Father, Daughter and Son in Slavery. However, both appear to have been significantly influenced by the plot and themes of Za√Øre which had been performed in Salzburg as late as 1777.Gutman (2001) p. 487 List of operas Clorinda dying in Tancredi's arms, from a 1589 edition of Tasso's La Gerusalemme liberata The earliest work on this list, Rinaldo innamorato by Francesca Caccini, dates from 1623 when opera was still in its infancy and performed only in private palaces or court theatres. During this period operas co-existed with other forms of music drama which featured virtuoso singing ‚Äì the intermedio (a short spectacle performed between the acts of a play with its own story-line) and the madrigale concertato (literally \\"concerted madrigal\\", a dramatic composition for voices and instruments, often performed semi-staged). Several works in those genres were also based on Tasso's La Gerusalemme liberata, including: *A set of intermedi composed by Cesare Marotta on the imprisonment, enchantment and liberation of Rinaldo (first performed in Rome in 1612)Hill (1997) pp. 258‚Äì260 *Giovanni Rovetta's Le lagrime di Erminia (published in 1629)Whenham pp. 135‚Äì136 *Monteverdi's, Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda (first performed in Venice in 1624)Smither (1977) p. 158 *Domenico Mazzocchi's Olindo e Sofronia (published in 1637)Rolland (1915/1977) p. 67 The operas below are listed in chronological order by the date of their first performance. Where this is unavailable, or the opera premiered many years after the composer's death, the date of composition is given.The chief source for the 17th- and early-18th-century operas is the Nordisk Netv√¶rk For Tidlig Musikdramatik, supplemented by Selfridge-Field (2007) and Sonneck and Schatz (1914).

J. Smith's novel series The Vampire Diaries. He is portrayed by Ian Somerhalder in the television series. Damon is the main antagonist, especially in the story's main setting, Mystic Falls. He is part of a love triangle between his brother Stefan (Paul Wesley) and a female vampire named Katherine Pierce (Nina Dobrev) whom they were both compelled to love when they were still human. A century after Damon and Stefan leave Mystic Falls, they both return and meet Elena Gilbert (also Nina Dobrev), a mortal who looks exactly like Katherine. Damon wants to ‚Äòwin‚Äô Elena away from Stefan, but she chooses Stefan over Damon, then Elena later breaks up with Stefan after she develops feelings for Damon. Character development Casting Ian Somerhalder was cast as Damon Salvatore at the end of March 2009, six months before the premiere of the series.Somerhalder joins 'Vampire Diaries' by Michael Schneider of Variety, March 25, 2009 The initial casting call for the character required an actor in his early- to mid- twenties to play a \\"darkly handsome, strong, charming, and smug vampire who can go from casual and playful to pure evil in less than a heartbeat.\\"Meet The Cast ‚Äì Vampire Diaries Casting Calls by Matej Jelic of Spoilers Guide, June 17, 2009, Somerhalder had not read the books until filming began.Ian Somerhalder talks 'Vampire Diaries' by Mandi Bierly of Entertainment Weekly, September 17, 2009, Television series Background Damon Salvatore is a vampire, turned by Katherine Pierce 145 years prior to the series' debut. He is the son of late Giuseppe Salvatore, ripper Lily Salvatore and older brother of Stefan Salvatore. Damon is portrayed as charming but cruel, taking pleasure in killing and feeding on humans, while Stefan satisfies his vampiric hunger by feeding on animals. Season 1 In the first season, Damon appears as the older brother of Stefan Salvatore, and plays the main antagonist.The Vampire Diaries episode \\"162 Candles\\" aired November 5, 2009. He has brief moments of compassion, however, such as erasing Jeremy Gilbert's memory of vampires and removing his \\"suffering\\" so Jeremy can get his life back on track.The Vampire Diaries episode \\"Haunted\\" aired October 29, 2009. Damon apologizes for turning Vicki Donovan into a vampire and admits it was wrong.The Vampire Diaries episode \\"\\" aired May 13, 2010. Damon admits to Elena that he came to the town wanting to destroy it but actually found himself wanting to protect it. The two begin to kiss passionately before getting interrupted - it is later revealed that it was not Elena he kissed, but Katherine Pierce. Later in the season, it is also implied that he actually feels human emotions, such as pain and love. Season 2 In season two, both Katherine and Elena tell Damon that they love Stefan, not him. As an expression of his anger, pain, and hopelessness, he snaps Jeremy Gilbert's neck, not realizing he is wearing a ring that reverses the damage done by supernatural creatures or forces.

After saving Elena with Stefan in episode 8 of season 2, Damon shows up in Elena's room with the vervain necklace that was ripped from her neck earlier in the episode. Before he gives it back, he tells Elena that he is in love with her, and because he is in love with her, he cannot be selfish with her. He also states that he does not deserve her, but that his brother does. He kisses her forehead and says he wishes she could remember this, but she cannot. Elena blinks and her vervain necklace is back around her neck, Damon is gone and her window is open with the curtains blowing. She had no recollection as to how the necklace was returned to her. In one episode, Damon joins Rose to find out why the originals are after Elena; after some time and clever banter, the two have sex, stating that they could rid themselves of emotion. However, when Rose, Damon's old friend who turned Katerina, is mortally bitten by a werewolf, he gives her the memory of her life prior to becoming a vampire and helps her remember how good it felt to be able to walk and feel the sunlight, without it burning her. Damon puts her out of her misery, leaving him to mourn the death of his one of few real friends. Elena and Damon then begin to mend fences, and Elena gives him an affectionate hug to help comfort him after Rose's death. Damon begins showing another side of himself in small acts that help build what once was an impossible friendship between Elena and himself after she clearly stated that he has lost her forever. After he spares Caroline's mother, Elena says how that was the person she was once friends with. It is hard for Damon to accept that he has to change to have her in his life, which he explains to Andy Star, his compelled girlfriend a few more episodes in. Damon is bitten by Tyler the werewolf at the end of the season. Elena takes care of him, and right before he is cured by the blood of Klaus, the original hybrid, she gives him a \\"goodbye\\" kiss, because she is sure he is going to die. She forgives him, telling him that she cares for him through grief- stricken tears. Season 3 In the third season, Damon helps Elena in bringing his brother, Stefan, back to Mystic Falls after Stefan becomes Klaus' henchman. The arrangement transpired after a bargain for his blood that would cure Damon of the werewolf bite he had received from Tyler. At first, he is reluctant to involve Elena in the rescue attempts, employing Alaric Saltzman, Elena's guardian, instead of as Klaus does not know that Elena is alive after the sacrifice which frees Klaus' hybrid side. However, Elena involves herself, desperate to find Stefan. Damon, though hesitant at first, is unable to refuse her because of his love for her. He also points out to her that she once turned back from finding Stefan since she knew Damon would be in danger, clearly showing that she also has feelings for him. He tells her that \\"when (he) drag(s) (his) brother from the edge to deliver him back to (her), (he) wants her to remember the things (she) felt while he was gone.\\" When Stefan finally returns to Mystic Falls, his attitude is different from that of the first and second seasons. This causes a rift between Elena and Stefan whereas the relationship between Damon and Elena becomes closer and more intimate. A still loyal Elena, however, refuses to admit her feelings for Damon. In 'Dangerous Liaisons', Elena, frustrated with her feelings for him, tells Damon that his love for her may be a problem and that this could be causing all their troubles. This incenses Damon, causing him to revert to the uncaring and reckless Damon seen in the previous seasons. The rocky relationship between the two continues until the sexual tension hits the fan and in a moment of heated passion, Elena ‚Äì for the first time in the three seasons ‚Äì kisses Damon of her own accord. This kiss finally causes Elena to admit that she loves both brothers and realizes that she must ultimately make her choice as her own ancestress, Katherine Pierce, who turned the brothers, once did. An assessment of her feelings for Damon, she states this: \\"Damon just sort of snuck up on me. He got under my skin and no matter what I do, I can't shake him.\\" In the season finale, a trip designed to get her to safety forces Elena to make her choice: to go to Damon and possibly see him one last time; or to go to Stefan and her friends and see them one last time. She chooses the latter when she calls Damon to tell him her decision. Damon, who is trying to stop Alaric, accepts what she says and she tells him that maybe if she had met Damon before she had met Stefan, her choice may have been different. This statement causes Damon to remember the first night he did meet Elena which was, in fact, the night her parents died - before she had met Stefan. Not wanting anyone to know he was in town and after giving her some advice about life and love, Damon compels her to forget. He remembers this as he fights Alaric and seems accepting of his death when Alaric, whose lifeline is tied to Elena's, suddenly collapses in his arms. Damon is grief-stricken, knowing that this means that Elena has also died and yells, \\"No! You are not dead!\\" A heartbroken Damon then goes to the hospital demanding to see Elena when the doctor, Meredith Fell, tells him that she gave Elena vampire blood.

She drinks his blood but pukes hours later. When Stefan finds out Damon has to feed Elena his blood he is very angry and hits Damon who just got in a fight with the vampire hunter.

Damon confronts Bonnie, who had taken the Ascendant, and tells her that Lily is threatening to destroy the cure if he does not return with the means to get her \\"family\\" back. However, when he decides to let Bonnie destroy the Ascendant, he comes home to find that Lily had actually given the cure to Elena instead.

Damon returns to the wedding to find Bonnie badly injured on the floor and Kai's reminder that letting Bonnie die will allow Elena to regain consciousness. Damon tells Bonnie he is sorry and leaves the room.

The murder spree then leads to the reincarnation of a siren named Sybil, who has the powers to seduce and erase specific memories in anyone's mind, thus making them committed and loyal to her. Stefan and Bonnie find Damon and Enzo after a turned-on humanity Enzo gives clues to Bonnie on where they can be found. However, both Damon and Enzo threatened them and told them to stay away. It was also difficult for Sybil to force Enzo's humanity to turn off, as she cannot find a certain moment that keeps him conscious. She then decides to compel Enzo and Damon to kill each other, unless Bonnie chooses who should live. She ends up choosing Enzo, which hurt Damon. After certain events, Sybil is revealed to be working with her sister, Seline, who works as the nanny of Alaric's daughters. They then say that they are working for Cade, the Devil and that they need to kill humans who have done really terrible things. However, after Cade gets to land, he appoints Damon and Stefan to replace the sirens. Damon, who still has his humanity off, forces Stefan to join him. Stefan then gets left with no choice in order to protect Caroline and their friends. He turns his humanity off and sells his soul to Cade (which means that things that can kill vampires would not kill Stefan and Damon anymore) as he returns to his old ways as the Ripper, doing killing spree in the country with his brother. During Damon's time with Stefan, he starts to remember Elena, getting distracted with his and his brother's job. This bothers Stefan, saying that Damon needs to forget about Elena. The necklace which Stefan gave to Elena when she was still mortal is believed to be the reason why Damon keeps remembering Elena, thus resulting in Stefan getting rid of it. Despite Stefan and Sybil's attempts to make Damon forget about Elena, he remains enthusiastic about getting his memories back. After Sybil turns his humanity on but takes his mind into hell, Caroline and Bonnie are forced to call Stefan, also expecting that Stefan's humanity might come back. However, it does not work on Stefan after he enters Damon's mind to make him conscious, but it does work on Damon. Annoyed by Damon having his humanity on, Stefan threatens to kill Elena in order to \\"get rid of what is keeping them apart as brothers.\\" The two brothers exchanged conversations that were similar to the first season, when it was Damon who was threatening Stefan that he will harm Elena, except that the roles have been switched for this moment. Stefan goes to Bonnie and Enzo's safe house where they hide Elena, and in order to get inside the house without invitation, he forces the realtor to change the owner in the contract and he kills her later. Enzo gets forced outside the house as he waits for Bonnie to take the cure, which she is supposed to give to Enzo. However, Stefan ends up taking the cure as a self- defense mechanism of Bonnie when he kills Enzo and threatens to kill her too. Bonnie becomes unforgiving to Stefan, even after he gets to become a human again. Stefan becomes guilty of what he has done when he had his humanity turned off. This also results in both Damon and Stefan not working for Cade anymore, in which Cade decides to bring hellfire into Mystic Falls to destroy the entire town. Through a bell, numerous vampires and characters who have been killed in the past seasons have returned, such as Vicki Donovan and Kai Parker. After Damon sees awoken up Elena, he hugs her tight, only to realize that it was Katherine who comes back from hell. Damon offers to sacrifice himself to make sure that Katherine returns to hell during their plan to stop the hellfire from destroying Mystic Falls. He says that it is the only time that he becomes a good brother to Stefan, compelling him to leave and stay away from the tunnels. However, Stefan actually has vervain in his system, which means that Damon's compulsion failed. Stefan decides to take the human cure from his own veins, making him age faster and eventually, reach death. While Damon is already holding onto Katherine while waiting for the hellfire to kill both of them, Stefan injects the cure to Damon. Stefan saves Damon, who is now a human, and dies with Katherine. Bonnie successfully breaks the spell that Kai has put on her and Elena's life. Elena wakes up during Stefan's funeral, where Damon and Caroline are saying their goodbyes to Stefan. Devastated by his death, Damon and Caroline show how their relationship improves. After bidding farewell to Stefan, they both reunite with Elena, with Damon sharing a kiss. During the funeral, Damon gives his daylight ring to Stefan, while Elena gives her vervain necklace. Damon hands over the Salvatore Boarding House to Caroline, which she then turns into the Salvatore Boarding School for the Gifted, where Alaric's daughters are staying. Caroline also receives a gift from Klaus, saying that he will always be waiting for her no matter how long it takes. In a flash-forward scene, a medical student Elena is seen writing on her diary outside the Salvatore crypt in the cemetery, while a crow flies over her head as she sees Damon. The scene is a nod to the cemetery scene in the show's pilot episode of season 1 when Damon can control fog and crows. They are also revealed to be married, growing old, and finding peace together. As Elena reunites with her family in the Gilbert house, Damon reunites with Stefan in the Salvatore Boarding House with the words, \\"Hello, brother.\\" This line is both his first and last words in the entire series. The Originals In the final season of the show's spin-off series The Originals, a medical clinic in Mystic Falls has the name \\"Elena Salvatore M.D\\" embedded on the glass. This means that Damon and Elena are married and that she successfully becomes a medical doctor. Legacies In Legacies, another spin-off series, Damon was referenced several times. His classic car was shown being driven, specifically by Alaric's now-grown-up daughter Lizzie Saltzman and her vampire love interest, Sebastian.

He always puts her safety first before anyone else, even his.The Vampire Diaries episode \\"Do Not Go Gentle,\\" aired April 26, 2012.The Vampire Diaries episode \\"Kill or Be Killed,\\" aired October 7, 2010. Somerhalder with his Vampire Diaries co-stars Paul Wesley (Stefan) and Nina Dobrev (Elena) at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International Damon's most prominent love, aside from Elena, was Rose. He met her while searching for Klaus and hooked up with her shortly after. Unfortunately Damon ticked off Jules, a werewolf, and she showed up on a full moon for revenge. Stefan Salvatore Damon has had a challenging relationship with his younger brother Stefan Salvatore for over a century. Before they became vampires, they both loved the vampire Katherine Pierce. Damon shows that he has nurtured a long- standing desire to reunite with Katherine throughout the first season. In the first season, we learn that it was Stefan who convinced Damon to feed and complete his transformation after Katherine turned both brothers into vampires.The Vampire Diaries episode \\"1912,\\" aired March 15, 2012. Despite the feud between the Salvatore brothers, both Damon and Stefan always have each other's backs. Damon is always there for Stefan when it really matters, e.g., saving him from being tortured, helping him through withdrawal, and working with him to kill common enemies.The Vampire Diaries episode \\"Masquerade,\\" aired October 28, 2010. And Stefan will still give up his own life for Damon's survival. They both actually love each other but will not admit it.The Vampire Diaries episode \\"As I Lay Dying,\\" aired May 12, 2011. Elena Gilbert After learning of Katherine's deceit, Damon starts to fall for Elena. In general, Damon is fiercely protective of Elena and always puts her safety ahead of all else. Damon comes to Elena's rescue at the Miss Mystic Falls pageant when Elena is left stranded without a partner, and the two dance. In the episode \\"Rose\\", Damon confesses his love for her only to compel her to forget about it because he does not believe he is worthy of her. Throughout the third season his relationship with Elena grows; she learns to fully trust him, and they begin to rely on each other as a team. They share two passionate kisses, but Elena remains in denial about her feelings for him. After a long struggle, Elena still chooses Stefan much to Damon's dismay. In the following season, Elena realizes that her feelings for Damon cannot be denied any longer. She and Stefan break up, and in the following episode Damon and Elena finally get together and have sex. Damon and Elena then both individually discover that Elena is sired to Damon, making Elena's feelings unfortunately known; however, Elena insists that her love for Damon is the most real thing that she has ever felt in her entire life. Damon remains doubtful, so in \\"O Come, All Ye Faithful\\" he sets her \\"free\\". In an interview before the season finale, Julie Plec stated that \\"This year, she's had a very traumatic roller coaster of life experience and it's changed her irrevocably‚Äîand at the center of it all was the diehard belief that she loved Damon, that she loved him more than she'd ever loved anyone.\\" http://www.eonline.com/ca/news/418990/the- vampire-diaries-finale-julie-plec-teases-elena-s-choice-bonnie-s-sacrifice- and-dynasty-style-fight In \\"Graduation\\", after the sire bond is broken and there remains no doubt about Elena's feelings, she reveals that she is in love with Damon. Damon and Elena spend the next few months together, having the summer of their lives. When Elena has to leave for college, Damon stays behind in Mystic Falls and they have a functional long-distance relationship. However, in the episode \\"Original Sin\\", Tessa, who is revealed to be Qetsiyah, tells Damon that the doppelgangers are fated to fall in love and that he is only a bump in the road that makes their story interesting. Damon refuses to believe in this and assures Elena that he will fight for her and their future together as she is his life. It is later revealed that there is nothing fated about Stefan and Elena, but that they were merely drawn together by a spell. After a tumultuous, back and forth relationship, Damon and Elena get back together at the end of the season, and they choose to sacrifice themselves together to save Stefan and Alaric and their other friends on the Other Side. When Elena makes it back but Damon is trapped on the collapsing Other Side, Elena is devastated. Damon says his last goodbye to Elena, telling her that she is by far the best thing that has ever happened to him, and that being loved by her is \\"the epitome of a fulfilled life\\", as Elena sobs inconsolably. In season 6, Elena is unable to move on from Damon's death months later. She pretends to be happy, but she is secretly taking witch herbs to hallucinate Damon. When the herbs make her dangerous to humans, Elena decides to have Alaric compel away her memories of Damon, because she will never be able to move on otherwise. When Damon returns, he attempts to help her remember their love story, but the compulsion will not break. Not remembering any of the good things about Damon, Elena still decides to give him another chance. She slowly falls in love with him again, ultimately declaring that no matter whether she has memories of him or not, she always finds her way back to him. When Bonnie returns from the prison world, she gifts Damon with the cure for vampirism, knowing that he wanted to give it to Elena. However, Damon is afraid that this will mean losing Elena. They discuss what human life together would be like. Elena initially rejects the cure, but Damon decides to take it with her so that they can have a human life together, including children. Damon always wanted Elena to have the human life she always dreamed of. Elena takes the cure, which breaks the compulsion, and her memories of Damon return to her. She recalls a memory from season 4, where Damon declares that there would be nothing more miserable than becoming human again. Elena is afraid that Damon would regret taking the cure, so she challenges him to think it through carefully. Stefan attempts to convince Damon that becoming human would be a bad decision, but Damon ultimately realizes that one lifetime with Elena is infinitely better than an immortal one without her, and confidently believes her to be his soulmate. Damon and Elena excitedly anticipate the beginning of their human future together, until Kai puts Elena under a sleeping spell, tied to Bonnie's life. Damon spends the next two seasons devoted to Elena, waiting for her to wake up. He repeatedly states that he is miserable without her, and will spend the next 60 or so years unhappily until Bonnie dies. However, Damon is committed to staying true to Elena and doing right by her. Elena is shown to be Damon's moral compass and his guiding force throughout the two seasons. When Damon is in the Phoenix Stone's version of hell, a vision of Stefan asks Damon \\"What would Elena do?\\" and this prompts Damon to forgive his mother, freeing him from hell. The phoenix stone's influence remains, and Damon accidentally lights Elena's coffin on fire (or so he thinks). Believing that he has unwittingly killed the love of his life, Damon becomes suicidal. When confronted with the hunter Rayna, Damon commands her to kill him because he is already in hell in a world without Elena. Enzo then reveals to Damon that Elena is still alive, renewing Damon's hope. When Damon realizes that he is a potential danger to his friends and family because he does not believe he is good without Elena, he decides to desiccate himself next to her. He writes to Alaric that before Elena, he did not know what it was like to be happy, fulfilled or complete and that he does not want to continue living without that feeling. After Stefan wakes Damon from his desiccation, Damon continues to be devoted to his future with Elena. At the end of season 7, he is lured into a trap by a siren, hearing Elena's voice calling out to him. When the siren takes control of Damon's mind in season 8, Damon spends a significant amount of time sleeping, seeking refuge in dreams of his memories of Elena. When Sybil erases Elena from Damon's consciousness only to insert herself into their memories, Damon fights back, instinctively drawn back to Elena. His love for her prevails, and he breaks the siren's mind control, regaining his memories of Elena. Julie Plec stated that \\"I think the only hope that he's holding on to is the idea of the two of them living in Tribeca in their brownstone and raising kids and having a life together as humans when this is all said and done.\\"https://www.tvguide.com/news/the-vampire-diaries-spoilers- damon-elena-human/ After Stefan gives Damon the cure to vampirism, turning him into a human, and Bonnie unbreaks the spell on Elena, Damon and Elena finally reunite. They begin their life together, getting married while Elena goes to medical school and becomes a doctor. Eventually they return to Mystic Falls to grow old together, where they died together of old age. We last see them walking hand in hand in the afterlife before reuniting with their respective families. Alaric Saltzman Alaric is a vampire hunter looking to avenge his wife by killing the vampire that killed her. It is soon revealed that the vampire that Alaric is hunting is actually Damon. Before killing Alaric, he confesses that he did not kill Isobel but turned her. Alaric is brought back to life by the Gilbert ring. The two remain enemies but work together on occasion. Eventually, the two become best friends and drinking buddies. Even after Alaric is turned into a vampire who kills other vampires, Damon does his best to ensure that they do not have to kill him. But with Elena's death, Alaric dies as well while Damon holds him. In the episode, \\"Memorial\\", it is clear that Damon still misses his friend as he talks to Alaric at his grave. Unknown to him, Alaric listens to the whole thing and even responds with \\"I miss you too, buddy\\". Damon's drinking buddy. Bonnie Bennett Bonnie first saw Damon in Friday Night Bites when he dropped Caroline off at cheerleading practice. They first interacted in Haunted, when Damon learned that Bonnie had come into possession of the Bennett Talisman. He needed this to open the tomb which Katherine was locked in (for 145 years or so he believed). At first, Bonnie did not want to have anything to do with Damon, saving his life only for Elena's sake and soon blaming him for Caroline's transition into a vampire. However, as time went on, Bonnie was put into situations where she had to work with Damon to achieve what they both wanted (albeit reluctantly at first). Their teamwork has often proved to be beneficial for both of them. Their relationship has even come to a point where Damon is visibly worried about Bonnie's well-being and was devastated when he found out about her death. The improvement of their relationship is seen in Damon's efforts to help bring Bonnie back from the dead. However, their unique friendship hit a speed bump when Damon reverted to his old ways. Finally, they stood side by side with each other as The Other Side collapsed, holding each other's hand and at peace with what is to come for both of them. They later discover that they are trapped in a 1994 Prison World. During that time, they start to bond and form a close alliance to take down Kai. Before sending Damon back home, she mentions that he is not exactly the last person she would wanna be stuck with. When Damon returns home, he does everything he can to find a way to bring Bonnie back, including a long road trip to Oregon to seek the Gemini Coven and also compelling Alaric to steal the Ascendant from Jo. They finally reunite at the Salvatore Boarding House with a hug after Sheriff Forbes's funeral. It is shown that Damon and Bonnie genuinely care about each other and have made sacrifices for each other. The clear changing point of their relationship is when in season 6, they are stuck in the Gemini prison world. After that they both show extreme love and fondness of each other. Damon gives up the chance to see Elena again because of his friendship with Bonnie (which must have been extremely hard for him, seeing as Damon has a Selfish streak. Bonnie was one of the things that kept him going while Elena was away, and one of the positive influences he had. In season 7, Damon initially detests Bonnie presence as she reminds him of Elena being missing from his life but later they both end up saving each other's lives a couple of times. Damon and Bonnie grow really close to an extent that Bonnie who always tends to do the right thing, was ready to break any rule for Damon and went really far to help him. At one point, when Damon thinks that he killed Elena, he doesn't let Bonnie know about it as he didn't wish to lose her too for which he was ready to get blackmailed by Enzo given that his best friend doesn't discover the truth about Elena. Her friendship and love for Damon was so strong that it even made Enzo (later Bonnie's boyfriend) envious of him. She even chopped of Enzo's hand to rescue Damon without hesitating. However, when Bonnie almost died while saving Damon, he decides to leave Bonnie to ensure her safety and dessicate himself until Elena wakes up (or Bonnie dies) which leaves Bonnie heartbroken. She confronts him and doesn't forgive him for deciding to abandon her for her entire life and decides against reading the letter that Damon left her. After 3 years, when Stefan wakes Damon up, Bonnie admits in a medical care centre that a person whom she loved and admired dearly, abandoned her and didn't care to even contact her after being back and now she has decided to move on. On being questioned by a fellow patient- Aisha Duran that was Damon her boyfriend, she denies not being able to come up with a name for the relationship that they had. On knowing that Bonnie is dying, Damon leaves no stone unturned to make sure she lives and asks for her forgiveness. Damon doesn't appreciate Bonnie's relationship with Enzo much but respects his friend's decision. Damon tries to apologize to Bonnie on several occasions but she turns him down and returns the letter the gave her, unread (She always carried his letter with her). Damon forces Bonnie to open the vault against her wish to save her life knowing that she would hate him. When Enzo protests, Damon tells him that he did what Enzo couldn't, he indirectly saved Enzo and Bonnie's relationship. Damon further tells that Bonnie already hates him and can't hate him anymore and he can live with her hatred as long as she survives. When she becomes a huntress, after her best friend Caroline and her boyfriend Enzo fail, Damon is the one to wake her up from her deep sleep. When Bonnie tries to kill Damon, he apologizes for leaving her and admits that he admires her and loves her a lot (just like Elena did). Damon along with Enzo enters the armoury to free Bonnie from her huntress side and get trapped. In season 8, Damon and Enzo are held captive by Sybil who was freed when the vault opened. Sybil finds out the reason of Damon's disloyal behaviour is Bonnie and orders him to kill her. Damon attempts to kill Bonnie but she is somehow always saved by her friends. After knowing that Enzo also has feelings for Bonnie which are not allowing him to be faithful to Sybil, she asks Bonnie to choose one between Damon and Enzo to be allowed to live. Just like Kai, Aisha and Enzo, Sybil also doubted that Bonnie and Damon are more than just friends. Seeing that Damon was about to kill Enzo, Bonnie chooses Enzo to live which angers Damon. However, Sybil chooses Damon and orders Damon to kill Bonnie who is saved by Alaric. When Damon wakes up from his sleep, he visits Bonnie to read out his letter to her and promises to her that he will never leave her. They both reconcile. Their friendship again hits a rough patch when Stefan kills Enzo and Kai returns. Bonnie fights with Cade (who runs hell) to save Damon's life even though he tells her to go away. They both share a dance at Stefan and Caroline's wedding. Both of them defeat Kai and their plan to stop the hell fire and Katherine works. Later, when Damon turns human she breaks the spell that links her life to Elena's and brings Elena back to life. She returns Damon the love of his life and decides to travel the world and live her spared life to the fullest with Enzo's ghost watching over her.

Paul, who lived nearby, claimed voices told him to \\"kill the witch on Emerald Road\\". To hide her scent from wild animals, he had soaked her in gasoline and buried her in her flower garden. Background In August, 1990, Paul refused his medication and later escaped from Eastern State Hospital (ESH) but was arrested near Fishtrap, Washington. While being booked into the Spokane County Jail, he overpowered a deputy, shattering the officer's shoulder. A jury later ordered the state to pay the deputy more than $100,000. Paul enrolled at Spokane Falls Community College in early 1992 and was allowed to leave ESH to attend classes. During the next two years he also worked part time at the Spokane Goodwill store and at an antique furniture shop downtown, sometimes for as many as thirty hours a week. A Yakima judge refused Paul's request for release from his court-ordered commitment at ESH in 1994. In 1998, he was allowed to leave the hospital to live with his parents in Yakima Valley, but had to return every two weeks to receive his medications. In June, 2000, Paul was approved for a full-time return to his family home in Yakima Valley.

Ant√º is the most powerful Pill√°n, who governs the other Pillans. In Mapuche mythology, Antu represents the Sun, as well as light, wisdom and spirit, and is opposite to darkness and the physical world,Pueblos Originarios, culture and myths website and is married to Kueyen, a spirit that represents the moon. Battle of the Pillan It is said that when Antu decided to take a Wangul√©n (of Mapudungun wang√º _l_ e _n_ , \\"star\\") as wife, all of them wanted to be picked as Antu was the brightest of the Pillan, but when he picked Kueyen, as she was the most luminious, great unrest started between the Wangul√©n. Peripill√°n, the red spirit of fire, was behind this, as he, Antu's rival, felt envy at Antu, as Antu's gold was undarkened by the flame, while Antu himself resented Peripill√°n as the fire was brighter than the gold amidst the darkness, as peace had ceased, the two Pill√°n fought in battle, and the spirits took sides in battle, many Pill√°n and all the Wangul√©n supporting Peripill√°n. The battle was long and violent, the land moved, as well as the Minche Mapu (in Mapudungun, \\"underworld\\") and the Ankawenu. As the fight extended, the sons of the elder spirits had grown, and in desire to take their parents's place, fought against them. Both Antu and Peripillan, angered by this, grabbed their giant sons by their long hair and threw them down, they fell on the rocky ground, one landing in the Puelmapu and the other in the Lafkenmapu. As they fell their hard bodies marked the land, forming tall mountains as they were broken into pieces and sunk into the depths of the land. Finally after the battle Antu had topped Peripill√°n and came out as the victor, blinded in rage and seeking revenge, he threw the defeated Pill√°n to the land and sunk them to its depths, then he put rocks, hills and mountains over he buried Pill√°n, forming more mountain ranges and Peripill√°n, the most powerful one, was buried with the tallest mountains covering him. This wasn't enough to put off his fire's light though, and as Peripill√°n and his allies try to free themselves the land itself shakes and tremors happen. Sometimes their fire is able to briefly escape their mountain prisons, as the smoke and fire columns coming off volcanos. Meanwhile, the Wangul√©n fearing retribution cried as they pleaded for mercy, and their tears fell between and on top of the newly risen mountains, forming lakes and freezing into snow in the mountain tops. Seeing this, Antu decided to be merciful and only weakened their light so it was slight and pale so none of them could rival Kueyen. Between the body of the fallen were the sons of Antu and Peripill√°n, and their respective wives cried in sorrow at their lose, so Antu felt for them and decided to bring them back to life, but in new forms, as giant snakes. Peripill√°n's son was to be known as Coi Coi-Vilu, while Antu's own son was to be known as Ten Ten-Vilu, and these were to be rivals as their fathers, and to do as the elder spirits willed. As a result of the fight, the earth moved so strongly, that the imprisoned malignant Wekufe spirits were freed from it and began roaming the land. And the universe was left with no harmony.\\"The great battle between the Pill√°n\\" Mapuche Documentation Center See also *Ngenechen References *Alberto Trivero (1999); Trentrenfil√∫, Proyecto de Documentaci√≥n √ëuke Mapu.

The pipeline is constructed and operated by Russian oil pipeline company Transneft. The BPS-2 was completed in 2011 and began to function in late March 2012.  History  The project was proposed after an oil transit dispute between Russia and Belarus at the beginning of January 2007, and was approved by the Russian government on 21 May 2007. Although in April 2008 Russia's Ministry of Industry and Energy submitted a negative profitability report regarding the pipeline, Russia opted to develop its own infrastructure for exporting hydrocarbons, bypassing former Soviet transit countries. The main goal of the pipeline is to protect Russia and its partners from the transit countries' possible decisions to raise tariffs or siphon off hydrocarbons. On 1 December 2008 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed a resolution ordering construction. The construction started on 10 June 2009. Construction was completed in October 2011. The opening of export terminal at Ust-Luga was postponed until 2012 due to damage by landslips. Route The long pipeline system runs from the Unecha junction of the Druzhba pipeline near the Russia-Belarus border to the Ust-Luga terminal on the Gulf of Finland. The length of the pipeline from Unecha to Ust-Luga is and the length of the branch line to Kirishi oil refinery is . The pipeline passes Bryansk, Smolensk, Tver, Novgorod, and Leningrad regions. Technical description The initial capacity of the pipeline at the first stage is 10 million tons of oil per year, which will be upgraded to 50 million tons during the second stage. Of this, 12 million tons will be transported to Ust-Luga and 12 million tons to Kirishi refinery. Diameter of the pipeline will vary between . The construction cost is estimated at US$4 billion. The second stage is expected to be completed by December 2013. The pipeline will have eight pumping stations. During the first stage, two new pumping stations were built, and two pumping stations (in Unecha and Andreapol) were renovated.

There is now no visible trace Excavation at Cross Drove in the 1990s suggests it was around 2.6 m deep at high tide, 6 m wide at the base and 10 to 12 m wide at the surface It appears to date back to Roman times although very little is known. Despite the extensive agricultural reworking of the area the route can still be traced with cropmarks, straight as a die from Bourne to Morton Fen. The alignment is obvious enough that it can be traced on web based satellite photography services between  The line of modern Spalding Road from near Queens Bridge to the bottom of Meadow Drove follows the southern bank of the alignment, which can then be followed out across the fields as crop marks. Several farm buildings in Barnes Drove and Morton Fen lie alongside the alignment, causing speculation about the antiquity of their sites. The location of the south western end is an interesting speculation. It would make little sense to stop short of the dry ground to the west of the Car Dyke or of the Roman Road in the town, and projecting the line of Spalding Road takes us to The Austerby and across the line of the modern Eau and south of the Abbey Lawn. This area has been extensively re-engineered many times, for the Castle, Abbey and Railway, at least, and is now under 20th century housing. It is unlikely that new evidence will emerge.

Buildings for the Minnesota Boat Club have sat upon the island since 1885; the current boathouse was built in 1910. Between 1949 and 1968, the island was used by the United States Navy. Today, it is home to paths, a plaza, and a bandshell. History Raspberry Island was originally named for the wild raspberries that grew on it, with the name appearing on the first map of downtown Saint Paul in 1851. In 1885, a wooden structure was built to house the Minnesota Boat Club, the oldest athletic club in the state. The Club constructed a new home in 1910, a George H. Carsley- designed building in Mission Revival-style architecture that is still used today. The name Raspberry Island remained until 1949, when the United States Navy built a small base on the eastern side of the island‚Äîthe west side was owned by the Boat Club‚Äîand it subsequently became known as Navy Island. Flooding in 1965 washed the wooden bridge connecting the island to the mainland from its moorings and away downstream. The Navy departed from the island in 1968. Many downtown Saint Paul employees used the island as an unofficial parking lot during the 1970s and 1980s. A 1995 Saint Paul City Council resolution changed the name back to Raspberry Island. Log jams were recorded near the bridge that connects the island to the mainland in 2010 and again in 2013. These caused trouble for local boaters whose docking space was diminished by the presence of the logs. The City of Saint Paul funded removal of the logs in both instances. Attributes and features Picnickers sitting by the new bandshell added during Raspberry Island's renovation Raspberry Island is located under the Wabasha Street Bridge. It has a total area of and sits at an elevation of above sea level. The Raspberry Island Bridge connects it to the mainland. Renovation A renovation of Raspberry Island that bolstered and added amenities to the \\"rather scruffy, barren place\\" occurred in 2007‚Äì2008. The shoreline was strengthened with limestone riprap; public restrooms were added to the Boat Club building; a plaza, trails, and an event lawn were constructed near a new bandshell designed for Saint Paul's Schubert Club; and 131 trees and numerous other shrubs, grasses, and flowers were planted. The project cost $5 million. Local WCCO-TV named the island's Boat Club one of Minnesota's best places at which to hold a wedding reception, noting that \\" it might be located downtown, none of the bustle or the noise of the city reaches the island\\".

He is best known for the role he played during the Anglo-Iraqi War. Biography Blomberg was a son of Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg. He was part of a German military mission to the Kingdom of Iraq which had the cover name \\"Special Staff F\\" (Sonderstab F). Sonderstab F was commanded by General (General der Flieger) Hellmuth Felmy, and Blomberg had the task of commanding a Brandenburgers reconnaissance group that was to precede \\"Flyer Command Iraq\\" (Fliegerf√ºhrer Irak).Kurowski, p. 131 He was also given the task of integrating Fliegerf√ºhrer Irak with Iraqi forces in operations against the British.Lyman, p. 63 As part of the latter, he was to raise a German-led Arab Brigade (Arabische Brigade) in Iraq from the thousands of volunteers available from Iraq, from Syria, from Palestine, from Saudi Arabia, and from throughout the Arab world. Before Blomberg could accomplish any of his tasks, he was killed. On 15 May 1941, Blomberg was sent to Baghdad to make arrangements for a council of war with the Iraqi government. The council was planned for 17 May. However, Blomberg was killed by friendly fire from Iraqi positions. His Heinkel 111 bomber was shot at from the ground as it flew low on approach and Blomberg was found to be dead upon landing. His brother Henning von Blomberg, was a captain and divisional adjutant in the German 1st Light Division before the war and on 22 November 1942, as lieutenant colonel and commander of No. 190 Panzer Battalion, fell in battle near Mateur in Tunisia. He had been Blomberg's only surviving son. The wife of Henning von Blomberg was Ruth. Following established practice, Blomberg's son-in-law, colonel Ulrich B√ºrker, the senior staff officer (Ia=the operations officer) in the 10th Panzer Division in Tunisia, was withdrawn from the front on 15 December and left his post on January 1943. B√ºrker was the Ia in the 10th Panzer Division from 1 August 1941 until 15 December 1942, during that time the division fought in the central sector of the Eastern Front, in April 1942 the division was sent to Amiens, France, for refitting, upon the Anglo-American landings in North Africa, the division participated in the occupation of Vichy France and in January 1943 the 10th Panzer Division was rushed to Tunisia as part of the 5th Panzer Army. B√ºrker became the Ia of Heeresgruppe B in February 1943. This command had just been transferred from the Eastern Front to Germany and was eventually sent to northern Italy (and then France). B√ºrker spent some time with OKW but by early 1944 he was a corps, then an army, chief of staff, first in the Balkans then on the Eastern Front. He was awarded the Knight's cross for his service with the 10th Panzer Division. B√ºrker's successor was mayor Wilhelm B√ºrklin, B√ºrklin and the longtime division commander ran over a mine in their command vehicle on 1 February 1943, the division commander the veteran mayor-general Wolfgang Fischer, was killed and B√ºrklin badly wounded. On 3 or 4 February lieutenant colonel Claus von Stauffenberg received his orders to take over as senior staff officer (Ia) in the 10th Panzer Division, and during the period it took for him to get there the army group Id, major Josef Moll, filled in as the Ia. One of the other Blomberg's daughters was married to Keitel's son Karl-Heinz. Karl-Heinz Keitel was sent to the Cavalry School and he eventually transferred to the Waffen SS, commanded units and was decorated.

Books and drums are kept for her blessings Ayudha Puja is a part of the Navratri festival (festival of triumph), a Hindu festival which is traditionally celebrated in India. It is also called \\"Astra Puja\\", the synonym for Ayudha Puja. In simple terms, it means ‚ÄúWorship of Instruments‚Äù. It is celebrated in Tamil Nadu as Ayudha Pujai (), in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh as Aayudha Pooja (), in Kerala as Ayudha Puja (), \\"Astra Puja\\" () or \\"Ayudha Puja\\" in Odisha, \\"Shastra Puja\\" () or \\"Ayudha Puja/ Khande Navami\\" in Maharashtra, and in Karnataka (in erstwhile Mysore State) as ‚ÄúAyudha Puje‚Äù (). The festival falls on the tenth day of the bright half of Moon's cycle of 15 days (as per Almanac) in the month of September/October, and is popularly a part of the Dasara or Navaratri or Durga Puja or Golu festival. On the tenth day of the Dasara festival, weapons and tools are worshipped. In Karnataka, the celebration is for killing of the demon king Mahishasura by goddess Durga. After slaying of the demon king, the weapons were kept out for worship. While Navaratri festival is observed all over the country but in South Indian states, where it is widely celebrated as Ayudha Puja, there are slight variations of worship procedure. The principal Shakti goddesses worshiped during the Ayudha puja are Saraswati (the Goddess of wisdom, arts and literature), Lakshmi (the goddess of wealth) and Parvati (the divine mother), apart from various types of equipment; it is on this occasion when weapons are worshipped by soldiers and tools are revered by artisans. The Puja is considered a meaningful custom, which focuses specific attention to one‚Äôs profession and its related tools and connotes that a divine force is working behind it to perform well and for getting the proper reward. In the cross cultural development that has revolutionized the society, with modern science making a lasting impact on the scientific knowledge and industrial base in India, the ethos of the old religious order is retained by worship of computers and typewriters also during the Ayudha Puja, in the same manner as practiced in the past for weapons of warfare. In Orissa, tools traditionally used for cultivation like plough, war like sword and dagger, and inscription writing like \\"karani\\" or \\"lekhani\\" (metal stylus) are worshiped. Legend Two historical legends relate to this festival. The popular legend which was also practiced symbolically by the Maharajas of Mysore alludes to a historical legend. It is said that on Vijayadashami day Arjuna, third of the five Pandava brothers, retrieved his weapons of war from the hole in the Shami tree where he had hidden it before proceeding on the forced exile. After completing his vanvas (exile period) of 13 years including one year of Agyatavas (living incognito) before embarking on the warpath against the Kauravas he retrieved his weapons. In the Kurukshetra war that ensued, Arjuna was victorious. Pandavas returned on Vijayadashami day and since then it is believed that this day is auspicious to begin any new venture. But in Karnataka, Ayudh Puja is celebrated by general public one day before of original festival day Vijayadashami (the Ayudh Puja Day). Another legend is of a pre-battle ritual involving human sacrifice as part of the Ayudh Puja (considered a sub-rite of Dussehara festival that starts after the rainy season and is propitiated before launching military campaigns). This practice is no more prevalent. Now, instead of a human sacrifice, buffalo or sheep sacrifice is in vogue, in some Hindu communities. The past practice is narrated in the Tamil version of Mahabharata epic. In this ritual, prevalent than in Tamil Nadu, ‚ÄòKalapalli‚Äô was a ‚Äúsacrifice to the battlefield‚Äù, which involved human sacrifice before and after battles. Duryodhana, the Kaurava chief was advised by astrologer (Sahadeva) that the propitious time for performing Kalapalli was on amavasya day (New Moon day), one day before the start of Kurukshetra war and Iravan (son of Arjuna), also spelt Aravan, had agreed to be the victim for the sacrifice. But Krishna, the benefactor of Pandavas smelt trouble and he devised a plan to persuade Iravan to be the representative of the Pandavas and also of the Kauravas. Krishna had suggested to Yudhishthira-the eldest of the Pandavas, to sacrifice Aravan to goddess Kali as a part of Ayudh Puja. After this sacrifice, Kali had blessed Pandavas for victory in the Kurukshetra war. Similar cult practices (considered as Draupadi cult practices) were prevalent in North Karnataka also but the ritual of human sacrifice was done one day after the Dasara on a stone altar outside a Kali temple. This part is disputed as it is not mentioned in Mahabharata. As per Mahabharat, Irawan the son of Naga Princess Ulupi and Prince Arjun, died on battle field, fighting bravely against demon(daitya) Alambusha.http://www.sacred- texts.com/hin/m06/m06091.htm#fr_438 Mode of worship An imported car decorated for the Puja The tools and all implements of vocation are first cleaned. All the tools, machines, vehicles and other devices are then painted or well polished after which they are smeared with turmeric paste, sandalwood paste (in the form of a Tilak (insignia or mark)) and Kumkum (vermillion). Then, in the evening, previous to the puja day, they are placed on an earmarked platform and decorated with flowers. In the case of weapons of war, they are also cleaned, bedecked with flowers and tilak and placed in a line, adjacent to a wall. On the morning of the puja that is on the Navami day, they are all worshipped along with the images of Saraswati, Lakshmi and Parvati. Books and musical instruments are also placed on the pedestal for worship. On the day of the puja, these are not to be disturbed. The day is spent in worship and contemplation. Practices in southern states ;Karnataka In Karnataka, the erstwhile Mysore state of the Maharajas of Mysore, the ancient Dasara festival started as a family tradition within the precincts of the palace. The royal family performs the Ayudh Pooja as a part of the Dasara, inside the palace grounds. The rituals observed are first to worship the weapons on the Mahanavami day (9th day), followed by ‚ÄúKushmanda‚Äù (pumpkin in Sanskrit)‚Äì the tradition of breaking a pumpkin in the palace grounds. After this, weapons are carried in a golden palanquin to the Bhuvaneshwari temple for worship. The tradition of the festival is traced to the Vijayanagara Empire (1336 A.D. to 1565 A.D.) when it became a Naada Habba (or people's festival). Raja Wodeyar I (1578‚Äì1617) who was viceroy to the Vijayanagar ruler, with his seat of power in Mysore, reintroduced the Vijayanagar practice of celebrating the Dasara festival, in 1610 A.D. He set rules on how to celebrate the Navaratri with devotion and grandeur. After a gala nine days of durbar, the Maharaja performs a pooja in a temple in the palace precincts, which is followed by a grand procession through the main thoroughfares of the Mysore city to the Bannimantap on a caparisoned elephant. The Bannimantap is the place where the Maharaja worships the traditional Shami or Banni Tree (Prosopis spicigera); the legend of this tree is traced to the Mahabharat legend of Arjuna (where he had hidden his weapons of war). The significance of the Shami tree worship is to seek blessings of the tree (where Lord Rama is also said to have worshipped) for success in the desired avocations (including war campaigns). This festival is also celebrated with lot of fanfare throughout the state, in all villages. In the rural areas, every village and community observe this festival with fervour but there have been conflicts on several occasions as to which community has the first right to perform the Pujas. Generally, the Ayudh puja in villages begins with the sacrifice of sheep and smearing the bullock carts with sheep blood. ;Kerala In Kerala, the festival is called Ayudha Puja or Saraswati Puja as part of the ten-day puja ceremonies, also named as the festival of autumnal equinox that is observed three weeks from the date of the equinox. The practice followed in the worship on two days involves the opening day, which is called Pujaveppu (meaning: keeping implements for worship). The closing day festival is called Pujayeduppu (meaning: taking implements back from worship). On the Pujaveppu day, all tools, machines, and instruments, including vehicles, musical instruments, stationery and all implements that help one earn the livelihood, are worshipped. On the closing day, these are taken back for re-use. In villages in Kerala, the Ayudha puja is observed with great reverence and several martial art forms and folk dances are also performed on that day. ;Tamil Nadu In Tamil Nadu, Golu is the festival celebrated during the Navaratri period. On this occasion dolls, predominantly that of the Gods and Goddesses from Hindu Tradition are artistically arranged on a seven-stepped wooden platform. Traditionally, 'marapachi' wooden dolls representing Perumal and Thayaar are also displayed together at a dominant location on the top step of the platform erected specially for the occasion. On the 9th day (Navami day), Saraswati puja is performed when special prayers are offered to goddess Saraswati - the divine source of wisdom and enlightenment. Books and musical instruments are placed in the puja pedestal and worshipped. Also, tools are placed for the Ayudh puja. Even vehicles are washed and decorated, and puja performed for them on this occasion. As part of the Golu festival, Saraswati puja is performed as Ayudh puja. This is followed by the Vijayadashami celebrations at the culmination of the ten-day festivities. Apart from the golu pooja, Ayudah Puja has become very popular when business houses celebrate it ardently.  Maharashtra  In Maharashtra, the festival is celebrated as Ayudha Puja/Shastra Puja, Vijayadashami, Dasara and Saraswati Puja. All weapons, vehicles, agricultural equipment, machines and metal items are worshiped with leaves of the shami tree (Marathi: ‡§Ü‡§™‡§ü‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§™‡§æ‡§®‡•á/‡§∏‡•ã‡§®‡•á), marigold flowers and the 'dhaan' that is grown during 9 days of Navaratri. Marigold flowers have a special significance on Dasara day. Saraswati Puja is performed and books, musical instruments, etc. are worshiped alongside the goddess. People perform a ritual called Simollanghan (Marathi: ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§Æ‡•ã‡§≤‡•ç‡§≤‡§Ç‡§ò‡§®), crossing boundary of the village and collect leaves of the apta tree. The leaves signify gold. People visit each other's homes in the evening and distribute the gold (leaves) as a mark of love and respect. Royal Dasara celebrations take place at various places like Kolhapur.

Gillespie County, 554 U.S. 191 (2008), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a criminal defendant's initial appearance before a magistrate judge, where he learns the charge against him and his liberty is subject to restriction, marks the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings that trigger attachment of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.. Attachment does not also require that a prosecutor (as distinct from a police officer) be aware of that initial proceeding or involved in its conduct.  Background  Texas police had relied on erroneous information that Rothgery had a previous felony conviction to arrest him as a felon in possession of a firearm. The officers brought Rothgery before a magistrate judge, as required by state law, for a so-called ‚Äúarticle 15.17 hearing,‚Äù at which the Fourth Amendment probable-cause determination was made, bail was set, and Rothgery was formally apprised of the accusation against him. After the hearing, the magistrate judge committed Rothgery to jail, and he was released after posting a surety bond. Rothgery had no money for a lawyer and made several unheeded oral and written requests for appointed counsel. He was subsequently indicted and rearrested, his bail was increased, and he was jailed when he could not post the bail. Subsequently, Rothgery was assigned a lawyer, who assembled the paperwork that prompted the indictment‚Äôs dismissal. Rothgery then brought this 42 U.S.C. ¬ß1983 action against the County, claiming that if it had provided him a lawyer within a reasonable time after the article 15.17 hearing, he would not have been indicted, rearrested, or jailed. He asserted that the County‚Äôs unwritten policy of denying appointed counsel to indigent defendants out on bond until an indictment is entered violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The District Court granted the County summary judgment, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, considering itself bound by Circuit precedent to the effect that the right to counsel did not attach at the article 15.17 hearing because the relevant prosecutors were not aware of, or involved in, Rothgery‚Äôs arrest or appearance at the hearing, and there was no indication that the officer at Rothgery's appearance had any power to commit the State to prosecute without a prosecutor‚Äôs knowledge or involvement.  Opinion of the Court  In an 8 to 1 decision delivered by Justice Souter, the Supreme Court vacated the Fifth Circuit's opinion, holding that \\"a criminal defendant‚Äôs initial appearance before a judicial officer, where he learns the charge against him and his liberty is subject to restriction, marks the start of adversary judicial proceedings that trigger attachment of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\\"Rothgery v.

Brown, known as Matt P.F. Brown (born November 24, 1976), is a football and track and field coach at Idalou High School in Idalou in Lubbock County, Texas, who is a gold and bronze winner in the Parapan American Games. Brown's left leg was amputated above the knee because of an accidental industrial explosion in December 2005. In September 2007, Brown won a gold medal in the discus, having set a record throw of 154 feet and 9 inches, and a bronze in the shot put at the Parapan games held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He has also competed in the Paralympic Games in Beijing, China in 2008, where he finished fourth in the men's discus. The Parapan and Paralympic competitions are held every four years. Brown graduated from Idalou High School, where he played football, basketball, baseball, and competed in track and field. He was an All-State tight end in football, All-District center in basketball, and a two-time state champion in the discus and shot put. He graduated from Wayland Baptist University in Plainview, the seat of Hale County, north of Lubbock. He played football at Wayland for two years and was an All-American in track and field there. He now coaches both sports at his alma mater. Brown trains for competition six days per week for three to four hours daily. His goal is to win two gold medals and to break the world record in discus, which is 47.81 meters. \\"I have a chance to break the record, and I think I can do it\\", Brown said in a 2008 interview with the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal. He has prosthetic legs for both walking and running. He has nerve pain caused from the trauma of the explosion. He must also obtain regular service maintenance of his limbs through a health-care company in Lubbock. Brown said that community support for his competition has been \\"unbelievable\\". The Idalou Independent School District allowed him to miss several weeks for the competition in China, to which he was accompanied by his parents, Charles N. and Janet Ladell Brown. Mrs. Brown said that the tragedy of losing his leg strengthened her son's Christian faith. \\"It's been a wonderful opportunity to witness and show other people that through God's help life continues on even in the face of adversity ... and that life can be a better life\\", she told the Avalanche-Journal. She describes Matt as an inspiration to the students he coaches at Idalou because he is not \\"angry with God about the loss of his leg but has grown in spirituality.\\" Brown said that he never expected to go to China: \\"Losing my leg has been a blessing in disguise, and I just want to do the best I can.\\" Brown's story was carried in 2008 and repeated in 2009 in a segment entitled \\"Discus Discussion\\" of Bob Phillips's syndicated anthology television series, Texas Country Reporter.

The incident occurred early in the American Civil War, at a time when the area was claimed by the Confederate States of America as part of Confederate Arizona and military control of the territory had not yet been decisively established by either Union or Confederate forces. Massacre Fort Stanton On September 1, 1861, at Fort Stanton, Confederate Lieutenant John Pulliam dispatched four of his men from the Army of New Mexico to the Gallinas Mountains, a day's ride away. Their objective was to watch for any approaching Union forces. Lieutenant Pulliam ordered the men to make camp a safe distance from the spring in the mountains. Not fearing attack, the four ignored this order and camped just 100 yards from the creek in a heavily wooded area. The four soldiers were T.G. Pemberton, Joseph V. Mosse, Joseph Emmanacker and Floyd A. Sanders. It is not known which of the four was in command. The next morning, at breakfast time, three Apaches were seen running through the surrounding pine trees. Immediately breakfast was stopped and the men saddled their horses. At this time, a shower of arrows rained down upon the Confederates from about thirty Apaches who had surrounded the camp. The four dismounted and took cover behind the pines and then attempted to shoot their muskets. To much surprise, all four of the weapons failed to fire. This suggests that either the Apaches had tampered with the muskets during the night or mountain dew had dampened their gunpowder. The Confederates then drew their revolvers and a skirmish began that lasted for almost two hours. By that time, Mosse, Emmanacker and Pemberton were dead. Floyd Sanders, left to fight alone, mounted Mosse's horse and escaped by riding down an almost vertical mountainside. The Apaches pursued him in a running fight which went on for ten miles. This account was what Sanders reported to Lieutenant Pulliam upon arriving back at Fort Stanton. Apache casualties are unknown. Within the next couple of days, a Confederate force of 15 men proceeded to the Gallinas Mountains; there they recovered the remains of Mosse and Emmanacker. Pemberton's body was never found. The Confederates returned to Fort Stanton on September 8; that same evening, Lieutenant Pulliam was dispatched with 15 men to Placitas to fight the Apaches there.

As of 2007, the organization is funded solely on private donations of more than $5.5 million per year. History In 1979 while driving to Bakersfield, California, Grillo rescued a black doberman which had been abandoned in the Angeles National Forest. He named the dog Delta, the first of thousands of animals Grillo made it his mission to save. A few months after rescuing his organization's namesake, Grillo discovered a few dozen more castaways during another outing to the forest. He brought them to his family home, which drew the ire of neighbors. Grillo purchased and renovated a condemned kennel for the animals and moved it to his present site in Acton. In 1989, Grillo set the first traps in a campaign to remove feral cats that for decades had lived on the beachfront rocks along the promenade outside Holiday Inn in Ventura. He received an endorsement of the move from the state Parks and Recreation Department, which controls San Buenaventura State Beach. Grillo said the two dozen cats he rescued were remnants of a sick and dying colony that at one time numbered about 100.‚ÄúBeach Cats May Swap Low Tide for High Desert ‚Äì Acton Activist Begins Trapping Feral Felines‚Äù.

David Hume, he says, was \\"adamant that moral philosophy had to be grounded in facts about human nature, in psychology and history\\".Morality Studies The New York Times, 3 February 2008. The book discusses the degree to which it is possible to combine first-person ethics, such as asking 'what should I do?', with third person observations about human behaviour.http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24188-experiments-in-ethics/ Contents Chapter One presents a history of Western philosophy, noting that science and observation were usually an essential part of philosophy. Chapter Two deals with the challenges presented by behavioural science to ethics. Chapter Three covers intuition, and its role in ethics. The book notes that intuitive responses depend greatly on how a situation is framed. Chapter Four argue for ethical realism and ethical pluralism, within certain limits.

Recently, \\"Billy Boy\\" Watkins has died of a heart attack after losing a foot due to a mine. Paul is woken up by a comrade and then takes part in conversation while skirting a village, mostly talking about Watkins's death. Then there are a series of events where Paul thinks about his family back home. He constantly wishes for his parents to be proud of his valor and courage. The irony in this story includes Paul viewing the sea as a place of safety, but once he gets there, he is still unable to rid himself of the fear that embodies him.  Summary  The story's main character is Private First Class Paul Berlin. The story takes place during the Vietnam War. It is Paul's first day and he is having an extremely hard time fighting anxiety and fear. One soldier in his platoon has already died from a heart attack. He was literally scared to death. Other soldiers tell Paul that they will just get used to living in the fearful jungle. Private First Class Paul Berlin is not sure if he will ever get used to the anxiety of war. ‚ÄúThey would have their rear guarded by three thousand miles of ocean, and they would swim and dive in to the breakers and hunt crayfish and smell salt, and they would be safe... But even when he smelled salt and heard the sea, he could not stop being afraid.‚Äù The conflicts in the story include person vs. self and person vs. society. These are shown by Paul trying to overcome his fears in the war, and by the fact that he went to war because he was drafted by the military.  Characters  * Paul Berlin * Paul's father * Paul's mother * Toby (Buffalo/Buff) * \\"Billy Boy\\" Watkins  Themes  Fear ‚Äì the major theme of this story is how scary war is. Paul Berlin experiences his fears throughout the story. \\"Though he was afraid, he now knew that fear came in many degrees and types and peculiar categories...\\". Courage ‚Äì Paul Berlin learns that he has to have courage if he wants to overcome his fear of the war. Although he does not overcome his fear in the story, he learns how to overcome it, and is closer to overcoming his fear. Determination ‚Äì Paul has to have determination to stay strong in the war. When he could have dropped out of the terrifying war, he decides to fight through it and not give up.

Hanes (October 19, 1916 ‚Äì May 8, 1997) served as mayor of Birmingham, Alabama between 1961 and 1963, a tumultuous time that saw the city become a focal point in the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement during the Birmingham campaign. Hanes, who served just one term as mayor, was part of a three-man commission that ran the city, a trio which included police commissioner Eugene (Bull) Connor. Hanes would also serve as legal counsel for defendants in two important murder cases connected to the civil rights movement. Early years Hanes graduated from Birmingham-Southern College, playing on both the baseball and football squads, before then earning a law degree from the University of Alabama. He then became an FBI agent moving on to serve as head of security at Birmingham's Hayes Aircraft in 1951. Mayoral career Ten years later, he began as the underdog in a runoff election for mayor of Birmingham, with his opponent, Tom King, a former district attorney, focusing on economic factors. Hanes found his niche in the closing weeks of the campaign when he began to emphasize differences toward racial issues between the two men. Hanes distributed a photo of King shaking the hand of black man, noted his support among blacks during the primary and referred to him as \\"Washington's candidate,\\" a clear appeal to those opposed to integration. Hanes won the election by nearly 4,000 votesScribner, Christopher McGregor (2002). Renewing Birmingham: Federal Funding and the Promise of Change, 1929-79. University of Georgia Press. Hanes' tenure as mayor of Birmingham was marked by virulent opposition to desegregation, an approach that helped the city to acquire the dubious nickname \\"Bombingham\\", a reference to the often violent nature of such protests. In addition, Hanes created a firestorm in December 1961, when he defied a federal court order by closing 67 parks, 38 playgrounds, eight swimming pools and four golf courses in the city. The order had demanded that those facilities integrated by January 15, 1962, but Hanes simply cut off $295,000 in park funds and dismissed its employees. Shortly afterward, he met with 60 local residents who implored him to reconsider his order, but Hanes remained adamant in his opposition. One individual had cited the inevitability of integration, but Hanes snapped, \\"That's your opinion, madam,\\" and later closed the meeting by saying, \\"I don't think any of you want a nigger mayor or a nigger police chief, but I tell you, that's what'll happen if we play dead on this park integration.\\" In November 1962, Hanes announced plans to shut down Birmingham City Hall's press room, saying, \\"Why should we continue to provide quarters, heat and light for our enemies?\\" He followed that up by indicating that he would no longer speak with newspapers that advocated for a change in the form of Birmingham's government to mayor-council and would only make available documents that were of public record. A subsequent editorial by Birmingham Post-Herald editor James E. Mills that criticized the move and charged that Hanes and other city commissioners had promised firefighters a raise if the vote failed. Since the editorial had appeared on Election Day, that and other alleged violations led to Mills' arrest for violating a 1915 Alabama state law banning corrupt practices. A four-day trial resulted in Mills' acquittal. The measure to change the government passed by a narrow margin, though Hanes continued to fight any election for mayor and council seats. His attempt to obtain a temporary injunction to halt the March 5, 1963 vote was rejected by the Alabama Supreme Court. Former Alabama lieutenant governor Albert Boutwell and Birmingham police chief Eugene (Bull) Connor emerged as the top vote-getters, which resulted in an April 3 runoff that was won by Boutwell. Despite the vote, Hanes indicated the following day that he wouldn't recognize the results, stating that he had been elected to a four-year term that wouldn't expire until November 1965. Despite the fact that Boutwell and the council members were inaugurated on April 15, Hanes continued his legal fight. He also championed resistance against the civil rights protests in support of desegregating downtown Birmingham stores in May and fully supported the drastic measures taken by Connor, which included turning fire hoses on protesters. Legal highlights During the second of the Selma to Montgomery marches in March 1965, a civil rights worker, Viola Liuzzo, was murdered. The subsequent trial of her accused murderers, Collie Leroy Jenkins Jr., Eugene Thomas and William Orville Eaton, resulted in a hung jury, but before a second trial could commence, the trio's lawyer, Matt H. Murphy Jr., was killed in an automobile accident. He was replaced by Hanes, who had served as a pallbearer at Murphy's funeral, insisted he would \\"stick to the facts,\\" a nod to the racist appeals made by Murphy in the first case. The trio was acquitted in the state court, but were found guilty in federal court on December 3, 1965, and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Less than two weeks after that verdict was rendered, Hanes was in court again on another case when he filed a libel suit against Time Inc. on behalf of Bernard Lee Akin, Earl B. Akin, Tommy A. Horne, James Thomas Harris and Oliver Warner Jr. The five men claimed that their businesses had been damaged when Life Magazine, in their December 15, 1964 issue, identified them as members of the Ku Klux Klan. The case was thrown out of court two months later when Federal Judge Seybourn H. Lynne ruled that the plaintiffs had not filed in the required one-year time period when they filed on December 16, 1965.\\" In June 1968, fugitive James Earl Ray, wanted for the murder of Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis, Tennessee two months earlier, was captured in London, England and retained Hanes as his lawyer. Hanes visited with him on July 5‚Äì6, 1968, approximately 10 days before Ray dropped his bid to avoid extradition. Expecting to travel back with Ray, Hanes was outraged when his client was taken back to Memphis in the middle of the night. Unfounded fears of FBI agents questioning him without a lawyer were the basis for Hanes' anger, who also said, \\"\\"The case against this boy is full of holes and I've got a few bombshells that we're going to drop into those holes.\\" Hanes never got that chance. On November 10, less than two days before the trial was to begin, Ray dismissed Hanes and replaced him with the flamboyant Percy Foreman, a move that was seen by many as a stalling tactic. Tensions between Ray and Hanes had begun to surface in September 1968 when Ray insisted that J.B. Stoner, a Georgia lawyer who was also a former Ku Klux Klan organizer, be added to the defense team. Hanes refused, but Ray dropped the request soon after meeting with Stoner. Ray's brothers had also complained that Hanes had not negotiated a better deal with Look Magazine on a series of stories on Ray's life, and also wanted libel suits filed against a number of magazines that had referred to Ray as King's murderer. Ray eventually pleaded guilty to King's murder and was sentenced to 99 years in prison in March 1969. Despite his dismissal by Ray, Hanes continued to support Ray's claims of innocence. On September 26, 1977, 73-year-old Robert Chambliss was indicted for the September 15, 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham that had killed four young girls, with Hanes and his son serving as the defense counsel. In the trial two months later, one of the most damaging moments for Hanes' defense came when Chambliss' niece testified against the man who had been dubbed, \\"Dynamite Bob\\" by authorities. On November 18, 1977, Chambliss was convicted of the murder of Denise McNair and sentenced to life in prison. Ironically, the verdict came on what would have been McNair's 26th birthday. In 1979, Hanes indicated that he was not a racist in spite of all of his past actions and defense of white supremacists. \\"Why, I've never known a man who was a Klansman. I've never associated with the group. I merely acted as any attorney for men who were alleged to be Klansmen. People are entitled to defense counsel.\\" Hanes died on May 8, 1997.

It was the first modern-fighting game based on ancient Japanese mythology (later popularized by SNK's Samurai Shodown series), and was created during the fighting game trend of the 1990s that began with Capcom's Street Fighter II. Shogun Warriors was followed by a 1994 sequel titled Blood Warrior. Gameplay Shogun Warriors plays similarly to some other 2D versus fighting games during its release, which the player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. It is controlled with an 8-way joystick and 4 buttons that perform weak and strong versions of punches and kicks. In one player mode, after selecting a character, the arcade randomly selects an opponent. The opponent order goes randomly and always leaves the last four bosses in a certain order. Some characters stabbed by ones armed with katanas or other sharp weapons can cause blood to spurt out, which became popularized a few months later by Midway's Mortal Kombat. The main unique feature of Shogun Warriors is its \\"grabbing system\\". When the player is grabbed by the opponent, the grabber must move the joystick left and right to make it more difficult for his opponent to escape, while the one being grabbed must rapidly press any or all buttons to make it easier to escape. Characters There are eight playable characters, and four bosses. Each with their own fighting style and special techniques based on the ones in Japanese culture. Besides the well-known \\"Winners Don't Use Drugs\\" screen being added to the North American version, another regional difference is that the Japanese version Fujiyama Buster contains original voice samples, while the North American and Worldwide versions were dubbed in English for some characters. * - His appearance, quotes and actions are based on T≈çyama no Kin-san, but also has the Shimazu clan's \\"cross in circle\\" wind crest on his uniform. His Japanese voice samples were replaced with sound effects in the English versions. * - He has the ability to extend his limbs for performing long-range basic moves. He is also the only non-human character in the game. * - Based on ancient Japanese firemen. His Japanese voice samples were later dubbed with completely different English words in the English versions. * - Although he true face is revealed in his motif, he wears a mask when fighting. * - While his look fully matches his occupation when fighting, his motif however shows that he has fangs like a demon. * - His chonmage is untied and he wears an ornamental apron labeled as . * - The only female character in the game. One of her moves is a fast-paced, one-leg spinning move. * - Although he has armor, and while his motif proves that he is actually a robot, he can still bleed when attacked by blades. Bosses * - The first boss in the game. * - The second boss in the game. Like Oni, Tengu's quotes are in English in all versions. * - The third boss in the game. He is a s≈çhei who has Sait≈ç Musashib≈ç Benkei as his motif. * - The fourth and final boss in the game. His appearance, victory taunts and motif are based on Ishikawa Goemon.

Founded in 1893 and incorporated in 1899, the club maintains its own dining room (designed by Angelo Donghia and later renovated by Peter Pennoyer) and boxes on the dress circle level of the opera house, and is open to its members for several performances a week during the opera season. Informally known as the \\"Opera Club\\", the club is independent of the Metropolitan Opera Association (MOA) (the official name of the Metropolitan Opera). Founded as a men-only club, the Opera Club has admitted women as full members since 1982. Members and their guests are required to wear black-tie for evening performances (although white-tie is requested for premieres, galas and certain Monday night performances) and a dark suit or morning dress for Saturday matinee performances.In 1947, Alf Landon, a Republican presidential nominee, was denied entry because he was wearing a business suit. The membership is sometimes affectionately referred to as \\"the Penguins\\" because of its attire. Early history The club was founded in 1893 when a collection of New York Society gentlemen created a private supper club in a lobby of the old Metropolitan Opera House on West 39th Street/Broadway while the back of the house was under renovation after a fire. Known as the \\"Vaudeville Club\\", members and their guests dined and watched performances from a miniature stage designed by Stanford White, a founding member. In its early days, the Vaudeville Club provided a venue for Society (and especially its wives and daughters) to enjoy, without venturing among the general public, illustrious and accomplished music hall performers such as Vesta Victoria, Ward & Volkes,Ward & Volkes, performingartsarchive.com Walter Jones,Walter Jones (1874‚Äì1922), basinstreet.com Mlle Violette, Papinta and her serpentine dances, and pantomimist Pilar-Morin. By the second year of the Vaudeville Club's existence, the Metropolitan Opera had resumed performances, and the club acquired the use of the large opera box that adjoined the club. Members would thus attend the opera and then enjoy the vaudeville entertainments afterwards. It became apparent over that season, however, that the late night music hall performances were resulting in minor scandal, while the members were increasingly availing themselves of the opera box. By the 1894 season the Vaudeville Club had changed its name to the \\"Opera Club\\", and in 1899 its members formally incorporated themselves as the \\"Metropolitan Opera Club\\". Relationship with artists The club has singers among its membership and often hosts dinners for prominent performers appearing at the Metropolitan Opera. Enrico Caruso wrote the club to thank its members for publicly expressing their support after he was arrested for breach of the peace at the Central Park Zoo in 1906. Support for the Metropolitan Opera Association Although the Opera Club is fully independent of the Metropolitan Opera Association, support for the MOA is central to the club's activities. The club donated the gold stage curtain that was made for the opening of the new opera house at Lincoln Center in 1966, and also contributed to its recent replacement. The club continues to make annual gifts to the MOA, which are often used to finance new productions or revivals.

Guggenheim Foundation in New York City.The New York Times staff.Guggenheim Foundation staff From the beginning of his work at the Guggenheim, Krens promised, and delivered, great change, and was frequently in the spotlight, often as a figure of controversy.Tuttle (1992)Yablonsky (2008) During his 20-year tenure as director he expanded the Guggenheim globally by enlarging and raising the profile of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, Italy, and then building the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, Spain (1997), Deutsche Guggenheim, Berlin, Germany (1997, ended 2013), the Guggenheim Las Vegas (2001, closed 2003) and Guggenheim Hermitage Museum, also in Las Vegas, (2001, closed May 2008), Guggenheim Guadalajara, Mexico (cancelled in 2009, originally to open 2011), and the Frank Gehry-designed Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, currently under development. Krens spearheaded spectacular exhibitions such as The Art of the Motorcycle and ambitious shows covering the art of entire countries, including China and Brazil. As director, Krens increased the Guggenheim‚Äôs endowment from US$ to US$ . Krens was succeeded as director of the Guggenheim Foundation by Richard Armstrong, formerly the chief curator and director of the Carnegie Museum of Art and a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Early life Krens graduated from Williams College in 1969 with a degree in political science. While at Williams, he also studied with art historians Whitney Stoddard, S. Lane Faison, and William Pierson, who are credited with forming the cadre of museum curators and art historians now known as the Williams Art Mafia. After earning a master's degree in studio art from SUNY Albany in 1971, he returned to Williams to teach printmaking and was appointed director of the Williams College Museum of Art in 1980. During this time, Krens earned an M.B.A. from Yale University, which launched him into a career in museum management. In 1986, he was made consultant for the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, and two years later became director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Directorship of the Guggenheim Foundation Exterior of Frank Lloyd Wright's Solomon R. Guggenheim museum in New York City during one of two renovations carried out during Thomas Krens' tenure as Director. 14 July 2007. When Krens became the Guggenheim's director in 1988, faced with a tight budget, a building in need of renovation and weak donor interest, he said, \\"If you want a vital institution, change has to take place on so many fronts that it's likely to be bewildering.\\" The 90s were a period of rapid expansion of museums across the US, not only the Guggenheim, and museum attendance was rising.Gibson (1998) \\"A National Endowment for the Arts survey released in September [1998] reported that 35% of adults had visited an art museum at least once in 1997, up from 27% in 1992.\\" Krens was at the forefront of this movement, and became a high-profile figure in the world of art museums, corporate and foundation philanthropy, and the marketing of art to the public.Gibson (1998) \\"It was Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim's director, who set the tone for the current hyperthyroid phase of museum self- definition. When he took over in the late 1980s, Mr. Krens shrewdly saw that he could use the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice -- a small sister institution -- to leverage the New York museum from sleepy also-ran into major international player. This it now indisputably is, never mind the risks to the collection as it wings its way from one overseas Guggenheim outpost to the next.\\"Mahoney (2006) \\"When Advertising Age told Thomas Krens, CEO-chief artistic officer of the Guggenheim Museum, that he had been named a marketing innovator, he was quiet for a minute. 'Is that an honor in my field,' he asked, 'or is it a negative? \\" On the subject of branding the Guggenheim, Krens said, \\"A good brand becomes an article of faith among a consumer audience. If you buy a BMW or a Mercedes, or stay at a Four Seasons hotel or go the Louvre, you can be pretty much guaranteed a quality experience.\\" During his tenure, Krens has increased the Guggenheim‚Äôs endowment to $118 million from $20 million, although he has been known to dip into the endowment to cover operating costs.Carol Vogel (February 28, 2008), Guggenheim‚Äôs Provocative Director Steps Down New York Times. Accessed 2 February 2011. Exhibitions and acquisitions Krens mounted several historic exhibitions that rank among the 10 best-attended shows in the Guggenheim's history: \\"Africa: The Art of a Continent,\\" in 1996; \\"China: 5,000 Years,\\" in 1998, \\"Brazil: Body & Soul,\\" in 2001; and \\"The Aztec Empire,\\" in 2004.Carol Vogel (April 27, 2005) A Museum Visionary Envisions More New York Times. Accessed 2 February 2011. Moreover, under his leadership the Guggenheim organized major retrospectives of Claes Oldenburg, James Rosenquist, Roy Lichtenstein, Ellsworth Kelly, Roni Horn, Richard Prince, and Matthew Barney. In 1989, Krens negotiated a gift of Impressionist paintings from the widow of Justin K. Thannhauser, acquired works of Minimalist art from the Panza Collection and oversaw the commissions of major artworks by Jeff Koons, Rosenquist, Rachel Whiteread and Gerhard Richter at Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin. These works later became part of the Guggenheim‚Äôs collection. In Bilbao, Krens led an acquisitions program that has included major installations of works by Richard Serra, Koons, Jenny Holzer and Louise Bourgeois. He also has doubled the size of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection. Museum expansion In 1986, Krens first conceived of converting the recently closed Sprague Electric, Marshall Street plant in North Adams, Massachusetts into the world's largest contemporary art museum back when he was director of the Williams College Museum of Art, one of many tentative expansion projects that Krens launched or proposed when he came to the Guggenheim. Krens's conception came to fruition when the site became the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MASS MoCA) in 1999. He was not discouraged by those that did not get off the ground, and through persistence was able to see several huge projects to completion. The success of the expansion in Berlin came on the heels of the collapse of a proposed Guggenheim satellite in Salzburg, Austria, while at one time there were as many as three nascent projects in Venice. While The Wall Street Journal complained at the time of many institutions expanding more rapidly than their collections allowed, leaving empty display space, the Guggenheim under Krens also found itself quickly acquiring new collections and being strapped for somewhere to put them, driving the need for expansions such as the Bilbao museum. Krens pointed out that the Guggenheim and many museums already had more objects in storage than they could hope to display, and spreading them geographically is a good solution.Dobrzynski (2000) The Guggenheim in 1992 had space to display at one time 3% of its 6,000 works. The strategy pursued, radical in the eyes of traditionalists, consisted of new construction and renovation, financed by bonds, and franchising by building satellite institutions around the world. Krens denied that deaccessioning (selling works from the collection) was a policy as well, though he was accused of treating the museum's collection of masterpieces as mere assets. The success of the Guggenheim Bilbao expansion was credited to Krens' tenacity and salesmanship, and was a major victory for him.Bradley (1997) As of 2006 the Guggenheim museums worldwide had received a steady 2.5 million visitors a year for the prior 4‚Äì5 years, and attendance at the New York museum had tripled, according to Krens. Part of the strategy of international expansion was for host country governments to bear the costs, benefiting from prestige and tourist income. Deaccessioning In 1990, amidst a wave of US museums selling off parts of their collections, Krens was in the spotlight for selling works from what was seen as the Guggenheim's older, core collection (Kandinsky, Chagall and Modigliani) to raise $47 million to acquire newer 1960s and 1970s Minimalist sculptures from the Panza Collection. That is, the Guggenheim was accused of being trendy, and The New York Times critic Michael Kimmelman said the sales \\"stretched the accepted rules of deaccessioning further than many American institutions have been willing to do.\\"Kimmelman (1990) Krens pointed out that the works acquired were no longer considered contemporary, but rather classics, and that such sales are a regular practice by museums. Style and controversy Krens has been the subject of criticism, both for his businesslike style and the way he changed museums, in particular the showmanship, populism and commercialization involved. Krens denied seeking to become a public figure, and said his media reputation is the result of \\"mostly inaccurate caricatures.\\"Mahoney (2006) \\"...for much of his long career at the Guggenheim, Mr. Krens has been both praised and vilified for turning what was once a small New York institution into a worldwide brand, creating the first truly multinational arts institution. Its reputation solidified by the triumphant opening of the Frank Gehry-designed Guggenheim Bilbao in Spain nearly 10 years ago, Mr. Krens transformed the Guggenheim into one of the best-known brand name in the arts.\\" One of his harshest critics was the New Criterion's Hilton Kramer, who sees Krens as a \\"bureaucrat\\" who has caused disaster at a major cultural institution. Kramer's reaction to The Art of the Motorcycle was condemnation,Plagens (1998) and the hint of scandal over the financing of a Guggenheim retrospective of the work of fashion designer Giorgio Armani elicited withering attacks.Kramer (2000) The charge that the Guggenheim had sold out to the mass market coincided with hip-hop at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston featuring guitar design, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art presenting rock music performance costumes. Krens dismissed the suggestion that Armani rented out the Guggenheim to show its wares, saying, \\"It's a non-story. Who do you get to support an institution? People who have relationships with it.\\"Ellison (2000) Krens gave up day-to-day control of the New York museum in 2005.Mahoney (2006) Lisa Dennison became the new museum director while Krens remained director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, amid some grumbling that the New York City building was being neglected, and financial friction with foundation trustees. Also in 2005, there was an attempt to force Krens out by a Guggenheim board member, billionaire philanthropist Peter B. Lewis, who had given US$ to the foundation. Lewis had become alarmed over the foundation's financial position and its reputation. The dispute ended with the board backing Krens and Lewis resigning.Sudjic (2005) Krens is seen by some young museum directors as a role model, or perhaps a cautionary tale. Exhibitions credited to inspiration by Krens have since appeared, such as a 2009 motorcycle show in Sydney, Australia.Meacham (2009) Guggenheim's Bilbao project is also credited with directly inspiring Fourth Grace in Liverpool and the Imperial War Museum North near Manchester. Norman Rosenthal, Exhibitions Secretary of the Royal Academy, said of Thomas Krens, \\"Krens is his own worst enemy. Everybody thinks that he is a corporate business type, but he is actually a great dreamer.\\" File:Peggy guggenheim museum.JPG|Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice File:Guggenheim Bilbao may-2006.jpg|Guggenheim Bilbao File:Berlin, Mitte, Unter den Linden, Deutsche Guggenheim 01.jpg|Deutsche Guggenheim File:Guggenheim Las Vegas \\"Art of the Motorcycle\\" Panorama 4.jpg|The Art of the Motorcycle Las Vegas File:Guggenheim Guadalajara.jpg|Guggenheim Guadalajara (rendering) File:Guggenheim Pavilions at Saadiyat Island.jpg|Guggenheim Abu Dhabi (rendering) Books by Thomas Krens   * Notes References         Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Directors of museums in the United States Category:Recipients of the Order of the Aztec Eagle Category:Members of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts Category:Williams College alumni ","title":"Thomas Krens"},{"id":"24405468","text":"Kalyani Dhokarikar (Devanagari: ‡§ï‡§≤‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§£‡§ø ‡§ß‡•ã‡§ï‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡§∞; alternate name: Kalyani Umbrani; born 9 May 1971 in Nagpur, Maharashtra) is a former Test and One Day International cricketer who represented India.

Hardstone is an unscientific term, mostly encountered in the decorative arts or archaeology, that has a similar meaning to semi-precious stones, or gemstones.\\"Cameo\\" Glossary database , Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Very hard building stones, such as granite, are not included in the term in this sense, but only stones which are fairly hard and regarded as attractive ones which could be used in jewellery. Hardstone carving is the three- dimensional carving for artistic purposes of semi-precious stones such as jade, agate, onyx, rock crystal, sard or carnelian, and a general term for an object made in this way. Two-dimensional inlay techniques for floors, furniture and walls include pietre dure, opus sectile (Ancient Roman), and medieval Cosmatesque work these typically inlay hardstone pieces into a background of marble or some other building stone. The definition of \\"hardstone\\" is not very rigid, but excludes \\"soft\\" stones such as soapstone (steatite) and minerals such as alabaster, both widely used for carving. Hard organic minerals such as amber and jet are included, as well as the mineraloid obsidian. Geologically speaking, most of the gemstones carved in the West are varieties of quartz, including chalcedony, agate, amethyst, sard, onyx, carnelion, heliotrope, jasper and quartz in its uncoloured form, known as rock crystal. On the Mohs scale of mineral hardness, quartz rates no higher than a 7, less for types with impurities. Stones typically used for buildings and large sculpture are not often used for small objects such as vessels, although this does occur. The term is derived from a literal translation of the Italian plural pietre dure, 'hard stones', which in Italian covers all hardstone carving. The semi-anglicized singular pietra dura is used in English for multi-coloured stone inlay work, in fact using marbles as much as semi- precious stones, which was a Florentine speciality from the Renaissance onwards.
