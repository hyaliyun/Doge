It also housed the offices of the town's newspaper: The Masonic Pioneer. The Lorena post office opened in 1905, changed its name to Masonic in 1906, closed in 1912, re-opened in 1913 and closed for good in 1927. Masonic's population in 1906 was about 500. The principal mine, called the Pittsburg- Liberty Mine, produced $700,000 in gold before closing in 1910. By 1911, Masonic was in decline, although some mines kept in production until the 1920s.

In the phrase \\"holy orders\\", the word \\"holy\\" simply means \\"set apart for some purpose.\\" The word \\"order\\" designates an established civil body or corporation with a hierarchy, and ordination means legal incorporation into an order. In context, therefore, a group with a hierarchical structure that is set apart for ministry in the Church. For Catholics, the church views typically that in the last year of seminary training a man will be ordained to the \\"transitional diaconate.\\" This distinguishes men bound for priesthood from those who have entered the \\"permanent diaconate\\" and do not intend to seek ordination as a priest. Deacons, whether transitional or permanent, receive faculties to preach, to perform baptisms, and to witness marriages (either assisting the priest at the Mass, or officiating at a wedding not involving a Mass). They may assist at services where Holy Communion is given, such as the Mass, and they are considered the ordinary dispenser of the Precious Blood (the wine) when Communion is given in both types and a deacon is present, but they may not celebrate the Mass. They may officiate at a funeral service not involving a Mass, including a visitation (wake) or the graveside service at burial. After six months or more as a transitional deacon, a man will be ordained to the priesthood. Priests are able to preach, perform baptisms, witness marriages, hear confessions and give absolutions, anoint the sick, and celebrate the Eucharist or the Mass. Some priests are later chosen to be bishops; bishops may ordain priests, deacons, and bishops.  Bishops  Bishops are chosen from among the priests in the Catholic Church. Among Eastern Catholic Churches, which permit married priests, bishops must be widowers or unmarried, or agree to abstain from sexual contact with their wives. It is a common misconception that all such bishops come from religious orders. While this is generally true, it is not an absolute rule. Catholic bishops are usually leaders of territorial units called dioceses. Normally, bishops administer the sacrament of holy orders. In Latin-rite Catholic churches, only bishops (and priests with authorization by the local bishop) may licitly administer the sacrament of confirmation, but if an ordinary priest administers that sacrament illicitly, it is nonetheless considered valid, so that the person confirmed cannot be actually confirmed again, by a bishop or otherwise. Latin rite priests with special permission of the diocesan bishop or the Holy See can lawfully administer confirmation; every Catholic priest must administer confirmation, even without permission, to children in danger of death. In Eastern Catholic Churches, confirmation is done by parish priests via the rite of chrismation, and is usually administered to both babies and adults immediately after their baptism.  Priests  Group photograph of an Irish family marking the ordination of a Fr. Burke in 1926. The word either derives ultimately from the Greek πρεσβύτερος/presbuteros meaning \\"elder\\" or the Latin praepositus meaning \\"superintendent.\\" The Catholic Church sees the Priesthood as both a reflection of the ancient Jewish priesthood in the Temple, and the work of Jesus as priest. The liturgy of ordination recalls the Old Testament priesthood and the priesthood of Christ. In the words of Thomas Aquinas, \\"Christ is the source of all priesthood: the priest of the old law was a prefiguration of Christ, and the priest of the new law acts in the person of Christ\\" Summa Theologiae III, 22, 4c. Priests may celebrate Mass, hear confessions and give absolution, celebrate Baptism, serve as the Church's witness at the sacrament of Holy Matrimony, administer Anointing of the Sick, and administer Confirmation if authorized to do so by the Bishop. See for the Second Vatican Council decree on the nature of the Catholic priesthood. =Rite= The Rite of Ordination occurs within the context of Holy Mass. After being called forward and presented to the assembly, the candidates are interrogated. Each promises to diligently perform the duties of the Priesthood and to respect and obey his ordinary (bishop or religious superior). Then the candidates lie prostrate before the altar, while the assembled faithful kneel and pray for the help of all the saints in the singing of the Litany of the Saints. The essential part of the rite is when the bishop silently lays his hands upon each candidate (followed by all priests present), before offering the consecratory prayer, addressed to God the Father, invoking the power of the Holy Spirit upon those being ordained. After the consecratory prayer, the newly ordained is vested with the stole and chasuble of those belonging to the Ministerial Priesthood and then the bishop anoints his hands with chrism before presenting him with the chalice and paten which he will use when presiding at the Eucharist. Following this, the gifts of bread and wine are brought forward by the people and given to the new priest; then all the priests present, concelebrate the Eucharist with the newly ordained taking the place of honour at the right of the bishop. If there are several newly ordained, it is they who gather closest to the bishop during the Eucharistic Prayer. The laying of hands of the priesthood is found in 1 Timothy 4:14: :Do not neglect the gift you have, which was conferred on you through the prophetic word with the imposition of hands of the presbyterate. The following is the full text of the Rite during the Mass (after the Gospel), taken from a program for an ordination of priests for the Diocese of Peoria in 2015: :The Calling of the Candidates: Those to be ordained are called by name, they stand in their place and answer: \\"Present\\". :The Presentation of the Priest Candidates: ::Vocation Director: Most Reverend Father, Holy Mother Church asks you to ordain these, our brothers, to the responsibility of the Priesthood. ::Bishop: Do you know them to be worthy? ::Vocation Director: After inquiry among the Christian people and upon the recommendation of those responsible, I testify that they have been found worthy. ::Bishop: Relying on the help of the Lord God and our Savior Jesus Christ, we choose these men, our brothers, for the Order of the Priesthood. ::All: Thanks be to God. :Homily of the Bishop :Promise of the Elect: ::Bishop: My dear sons, before you enter the Order of the Priesthood, you must declare before the people of God your intention to undertake this office. Do you resolve, with the help of the Holy Spirit, to discharge without fail the office of Priesthood in the presbyteral rank, as worthy fellow workers with the Order of Bishops in caring for the Lord's flock? ::Elect: I do. ::Bishop: Do you resolve to exercise the ministry of the word worthily and wisely, preaching the Gospel and teaching the Catholic faith? ::Elect: I do. ::Bishop: Do you resolve to celebrate faithfully and reverently, in accord with the Church's tradition, the mysteries of Christ, especially the Sacrifice of the Eucharist and the Sacrament of Reconciliation, for the glory of God and the sanctification of the Christian people? ::Elect: I do. ::Bishop: Do you resolve to implore with us God's mercy upon the people entrusted to your care by observing the command to pray without ceasing? ::Elect: I do. ::Bishop: Do you resolve to be united more closely every day to Christ the High Priest, who offered himself for us to the Father as a pure Sacrifice, and with him to consecrate yourselves to God for the salvation of all? ::Elect: I do, with the help of God. :Promise of Obedience of the Priest Candidates: ::Each of the candidates goes to the Bishop and, kneeling before him, places his joined hands between those of the Bishop. ::Bishop: Do you promise respect and obedience to me and my successors? ::Elect: I do. ::Bishop: May God, who has begun this good work in you bring it to fulfillment. :Invitation to Prayer :Litany of the Saints :Laying on of Hands: The Bishop first lays hands on the head of each candidate, followed by the concelebrating priests and all the priests present. :Prayer of Consecration :Investiture with the Stole and Chasuble :Anointing of Hands: The Bishop receives the linen gremial and anoints with Sacred Chrism the palms of each new priest as he kneels before him. :Procession of the Gifts of Bread and Wine by the relatives of the ordained and Offertory Hymn :Presentation of the Gifts :The Bishop stands and gives the kiss of peace to the new priests, followed by the concelebrants and all the priests present. The mass then proceeds as normal with the Liturgy of the Eucharist, with the newly ordained priests to the immediate right of the Bishop and the other celebrants.  Deacons  The Diaconate is one of the three Major Orders in the Catholic Church. The first deacons were ordained by the Apostles in Acts of the Apostles chapter 6. The ministry of the deacon in the Roman Catholic Church is described as one of service in three areas: the Word, the Liturgy and Charity. The deacon's ministry of the Word includes proclaiming the Gospel during the Mass, preaching and teaching. The deacon's liturgical ministry includes various parts of the Mass proper to the deacon, including being an ordinary minister of Holy Communion and the proper minister of the chalice when Holy Communion is administered under both kinds. The ministry of charity involves service to the poor and marginalized and working with parishioners to help them become more involved in such ministry. As clerics, deacons are required to say the Liturgy of the Hours daily; Deacons, like bishops and priests, are ordinary ministers of the Sacrament of Baptism and can serve as the church's witness at the sacrament of Holy Matrimony, which the bride and groom administer to each other. Deacons may also preside over funeral rites outside of Mass, They can preside over various services such as Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, and they may give certain blessings.  Minor orders  From the 3rd century AD up until seven years after the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965), the Roman Catholic Church had four minor orders up to the order of subdeacon, which were conferred on seminarians pro forma before they became deacons. The minor orders and the subdiaconate were not considered sacraments, and for simplicity were suppressed under Pope Paul VI in 1972. Only those orders (deacon, priest, bishop) previously considered major orders of divine institution were retained in most of the Latin rite. Previously some included the subdiaconate into the major orders, and excluded mentioning the order of bishop, as this order was seen as the fullness of the priestly order already conferred. The total number of minor and major orders in the pre-1966 structure was however always considered to be seven.  Holy orders  Holy orders is one of three Catholic sacraments that Catholics believe to make an indelible mark called a sacramental character on the recipient's soul (the other two are baptism and confirmation). This sacrament can only be conferred on baptized men.can. 1024 CIC/83 If a woman attempts to be ordained, both she and the person who attempts to ordain her are excommunicated latae sententiae.CNS STORY: Text of Vatican congregation's decree on attempts to ordain women Such titles as cardinal, monsignor, archbishop, etc., are not sacramental orders. These are simply offices; to receive one of those titles is not an instance of the sacrament of holy orders. = Norms = The Catholic Church recognizes the validity of holy orders administered by the Eastern Orthodox, Polish National, Oriental Orthodox, and the Assyrian Church of the East because those churches have maintained the apostolic succession of bishops, i.e., their bishops claim to be in a line of succession dating back to the Apostles, just as Catholic bishops do. Consequently, if a priest of one of those eastern churches converts to Roman Catholicism, his ordination is already valid; however, to exercise the order received, he would need to be incardinated either into a religious ordained in the Catholic Church (though there is much debate in the Orthodox Church about this); that is part of the policy called church economy. A controversy in the Catholic Church over the question of whether Anglican holy orders are valid was settled by Pope Leo XIII in 1896, who wrote in that Anglican orders lack validity because the rite by which priests were ordained was not correctly performed from 1547 to 1553 and from 1558 to the 19th century, thus causing a break of continuity in apostolic succession and a break with the sacramental intention of the Church. Leo XIII condemned the Anglican ordinals and deemed the Anglican orders \\"absolutely null and utterly void\\". Some Changes in the Anglican Ordinal since King Edward VI, and a fuller appreciation of the pre-Reformation ordinals suggest, according to some private theologians, that the correctness of the dismissal of Anglican orders may be questioned; however remains Roman Catholic definitive teaching and was reinforced by then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who later became Pope Benedict XVI. Since 1896 many Anglican bishops have been consecrated by bishops of the Old Catholic Church. Nevertheless, all Anglican clergymen who desire to enter the Catholic Church do so as laymen and must be ordained in the Catholic Church in order to serve as priests. Catholics are, according to and Cardinal Ratzinger, obliged to hold the position that Anglican orders are invalid. Catholics do not recognize the ordination of ministers in other, Protestant, churches that do not maintain the apostolic succession. The Lutheran Churches of Sweden and Finland have always maintained unbroken apostolic succession and their holy orders have never been dismissed by Rome. This is not the case for the Lutheran Churches of Norway, Denmark, and Iceland where there occurred breaks in succession. Anglicans accept the ordination of most mainline denominations; however, only those denominations in full communion with the Anglican Communion, such as some Lutheran denominations, may preside at services requiring a priest. = Marriage and holy orders = Married men may be ordained to the diaconate as Permanent Deacons, but in the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church may not be ordained to the priesthood. In the Eastern Catholic Churches and in the Eastern Orthodox Church married deacons may be ordained priests, but may not become bishops. Bishops in the Eastern Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox churches are almost always drawn from among monks, who have taken a vow of celibacy. They may be widowers, though; it is not required of them never to have been married. In some cases widowed permanent deacons, or single permanent deacons that later discerned a calling to the priesthood, have been ordained to the priesthood. There have been some situations in which male converts previously married and ordained to the priesthood of an Anglican or Lutheran church have been ordained to the Catholic priesthood, sometimes (conditionally), and allowed to function much as an Eastern Rite priest but in a Latin Rite setting; however, this may only happen with the approval of the priest's Bishop and a special permission by the Pope. Some former Anglican, Lutheran, or Episcopal priests who are married, but have either no children, or adult and non-dependent children away from home, can be given a dispensation by the Bishop and the Pope to serve as priests; these married priests, with or without children, may not become Latin-rite Bishops, but can be made Pastors of a Church, vicars general or episcopal vicars or deans, or monsignors (see the 1983 Code of Canon Law for the Latin-rite Churches, and episcopal conference website guidelines, and the website for the Diocese of former Anglicans who became Catholics but retained their Anglican heritage, for more information).  Clerical celibacy  There is a distinction drawn between chastity and celibacy. Celibacy is the state of not being married, so a promise of celibacy is a promise not to enter into marriage but instead to consecrate one's life to service (in other words, \\"married to God\\"). Chastity, a virtue expected of all Christians, is the state of sexual purity; for a vowed celibate, or for the single person, chastity means the abstinence from sexual activity. For the married person, chastity means the practice of sex only within marriage.

The church dedicated to St Margaret was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1966 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. The village is a commuter settlement for those working in Hull and Beverley. The village has one public house, The Travellers Rest. In 1823 Long Riston was a civil parish in the Wapentake and Liberty of Holderness. Population at the time was 361. Occupations included eight farmers, two blacksmiths, three grocers, two shoemakers, two tailors, two wheelwrights, a butcher, a bricklayer, a hawker, and the landlord of The Traveller public house. Two carriers operated between the village and Hull, and Beverley, twice weekly. In 1872 land adjacent to Main Street was given for the establishment of a school. The school was completed in March 1873. Until the late 1950s it was known as Long Riston School and served both Long Riston and the hamlet of Arnold. Subsequently, it became known as Riston C E Primary School. The school is a voluntary controlled church school in the diocese of York.

Based at the Royal Bath and West of England Society Showground near Shepton Mallet in Somerset, the society is a registered charity in England and Wales (no. 1039397). Nowadays the society offers a variety of services relating to agriculture and veterinary science including public and professional events, seminars and advice, scholarships, and a marketplace for countryside products. Foundation In 1775 Edmund Rack, a draper and the son of a labouring weaver, moved from his native Norfolk to the city of Bath. Despite his modest upbringing, Rack had developed interests both in literature and agriculture, and especially the application of modern methods to farming. He was struck on his arrival by the poor standard of agricultural practise in the West Country, and in a series of letters to the Farmer's Magazine and the Bath Chronicle argued that it was in the interest of all involved to make a concerted effort to improve productivity. Thus on the 28 August 1777 the Bath Chronicle printed a notice addressed to \\"The Nobility and Gentry in the counties of Somerset, Gloucester, Wiltshire and Dorset in general, and the Cities of Bath and Bristol in particular\\". This notice, paid for by Rack, proposed the formation of a \\"Society in this City, for the encouragement of Agriculture, Planting, Manufactures, Commerce, and the Fine Arts...\\". A number of philanthropists responded, and at a meeting on 8 September inaugurated the Bath and West of England Society for the Encouragement of Agriculture, Arts, Manufactures and Commerce,The Bath and West of England Society for the Encouragement of Agriculture, Arts, Manufactures and Commerce is also referred to as Bath and West of England Agricultural Society . nominating Rack as the society's secretary. The same year, the Aims, Rules and Orders of the Society were published, which set out the activities of the society for the years to come. These involved the improvement of areas such as animal husbandry, farm implements and country crafts through education, experimentation and prize- giving. In 1780 a site at Weston, Bath was taken over for use by the society as an experimental farm. Although this particular venture ended around a decade later, for the next 196 years the society's headquarters were located in properties within the city of Bath, until in 1974 its administration moved to a new permanent home in Shepton Mallet. 18th and 19th centuries The year 1780 saw the first major publication of the society when Volume I of the Letters and Papers appeared. These disseminated advice and scientific opinion on agriculture and other subjects of interest, and were printed irregularly until finishing with Volume XV in 1829. Later in its history the society resumed publishing with a full journal. In 1859 the decision was made to move the annual meetings of the society out of the city of Bath, and each year convene in a different town in the society's area. These were combined with annual agricultural shows which proved enormously popular, and continue to the present day. The society was then renamed in 1869 as the 'Bath and West of England Society and Southern Counties Association for the Encouragement of Agriculture, Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce' to reflect its influence in areas outside the vicinity of the city, and further name changes occurring in the 1890s finished with the 'Bath and West and Southern Counties Society'. Since the 20th Century A final change of name created the present 'Royal Bath and West of England Society', and in 1994 the society was registered as a full charity under British law. The society continues to organise events around the west of England including a flower show and the Royal Bath and West Show, which in 2005 attracted 150,000 visitors. The current president of the society is HRH The Countess of Wessex. The Royal Bath and West Showground is the location for many events throughout the year, including the New Wine summer conferences.

Like much of Leigh's work, the film is set in present-day London, and depicts three working-class families and their everyday lives. Plot summary The film begins with a day nearing end. Rachel, the daughter in the first family, is shown working in a nursing home. Phil, her father, is shown driving people around in his minicab. Penny, Rachel's mother, is shown working as a cashier at Safeway store alongside Maureen, the mother in the second family. When Penny leaves work, she cycles home to find her 18-year-old son Rory in a fight with a local boy for taking his football. Rory is a lazy, obese, ill-mannered teenager who neither goes to school nor has a job. Complications with his obesity arise when after an altercation with a gang of youths playing \\"Piggy in the Middle\\", he runs out of breath, begins to hyperventilate and is hospitalized after suffering a heart attack. The second family consists of Maureen, another cashier at Safeway, and her daughter Donna, a waitress at a cafe. Donna becomes pregnant by her boyfriend, Jason, despite being on the pill, and this leads to a heated argument among the three characters. The third family consists of Ron, who also drives a minicab, his unemployed teenage daughter Samantha, and his wife Carol, an unemployed alcoholic. Samantha shows interest in both Jason and Craig, a taciturn young man who seems to stalk her.

The instrument consists of an adjustable brass resonator, which is supplied with a constant flow of air across the opening at the top. Turning a graduated cam on the front of the apparatus raises or lowers a piston in the bottom of the resonator, changing the volume of its interior, thus altering the sounded pitch over a continuous range. The spiral-shaped cam is such that equal angles of rotation approximately correspond to equal changes in frequency. A dial on the front of the cam indicates the current resonance frequency and musical tone of the instrument. Subsequent improvements to the device include the addition by G. M. Whipple of a gasometer, in order to regulate the incoming air supply. A version of the device was also produced in which the bottom of the resonator was not displaced by a spiral, but by rack and pinion (see figure); in these, an eccentrically-operated pointer is used to indicate the frequency on the scale. The instrument has been used in demonstrations, for tuning other instruments, and for research in psychology and otology. According to Stern, his research in the \\"apperception of change\\" began a \\"decisive metamorphosis\\" in his understanding: See also * Variator * Medicine and Health * Audiology * Tuning Fork * Cavity resonator External articles and further reading Tone variator with rack and pinion design. ;General references *\\"Tone variator\\".

The game features 12 playable fighters, and plays out on multi-tiered stages. Reception Battle Monsters was panned by most critics, who found that the scaling graphics, complex controls, interactive backgrounds, and multi-tiered arenas do not work together well.

As of 1 February 2015, Israel is ranked 57th in the IRB World Rankings. Their home ground is at the Wingate Institute in Netanya, Central District, known for its large number of immigrants from English-speaking countries. History The sport was brought to the country by British soldiers during the Mandate era, but petered out after the British left. A wave of immigration from English-speaking countries since 1967 has seen renewed interest in the sport, particularly in areas with large English- speaking populations such as Ra'anana and Jerusalem. Israel playing Lithuania in 2009. A national league was set up in 1972, and the Israel Rugby Union (now Rugby Israel) formed in 1975. Israel's first international match was away to Switzerland on 25 May 1981, and ended 9–9. The Union joined the International Rugby Board in 1988, and participated in the European section of the qualifying rounds for the 1991 Rugby World Cup. In a group with Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland, Israel lost all three matches, but were by no means humiliated. In the qualifying matches for the 1995 World Cup, Israel thrashed Hungary 67–8 in the preliminary round, before being knocked out in the Round 1 group stage, failing to score a point in two of their three games. The qualifying matches for the 1999 Rugby World Cup followed the established pattern, with Israel being knocked out in the group stage, though they avoided finishing bottom of their five-team group by beating Austria. The same happened in the 2003 WC qualifiers, where they finished fourth in a six team group. In the 2007 WC qualifiers they did not even make it to the group stage, being thrashed 113–7 on aggregate (0–53, 60–7) by Lithuania.

In the 2006 championship, Israel won the 5th place (plate winners) with wins over Bosnia, Luxembourg, Hungary and Malta. The 2007 tournament featured a fresh team with many young players. After winning against Luxembourg, Latvia, and Hungary, they lost in the plate final to Denmark. 2008 was a highlight year for the women's 7-a-side team. They played in the qualifying tournament in Bosnia and finished 3rd, losing only to Romania (eventual tournament champion) and Finland (2nd place). The team recorded wins over Croatia, Georgia, Serbia, Austria and a thrilling 3rd place win over Bulgaria (7–5).

Population: History Founded by the Russian Greek Orthodox Inkeriköt (Izhorians) in the 17th century and called Savelionkylä (or Savelankylä), the village later changed its name to Savelino () due to its proximity to the village of Savelikha, which was built in 1870 during the construction and expansion of the private Rybinsk-Bologoye Railway. The railway merged with the narrow gauge (1067 mm) Novgorod Railway and broad gauge (1829 mm) Tsarskoye Selo Railway in 1895 to form a new private railway company, which then built two branch lines from Savelino — one to Kashin () and the other one to Krasny Kholm () in 1898 and 1899 respectively. During the Soviet era, following the construction of new railway lines and a bridge over the Volga River, Sonkovo became a major railway station. In 1903, the settlement was renamed Sonkovo to avoid possible confusion and a main locomotive depot constructed near the station. Sonkovo received urban-type settlement status to in 1928. Currently, the railway line east of Sonkovo–Rybinsk–Yaroslavl is part of the Russia's Northern Railway Administration, while the remainder of the railway lines in Tver Oblast belong to the Oktyabrsk (October) Railway Administration. Prior to the 1917 October Revolution, about one third of the Sonkovo's inhabitants were so-called Tver Karelians who spoke their own dialect of Karelian (Karielan: kielt). The majority of the dwellings in Sonkovo are wooden although there are many two and three story brick and concrete buildings as well as numerous pre- World War II structures. The center of the settlement is located next to the train station and its main street, Lenina Avenue, connects to Bezhetsk via the R-85 highway. Sonkovo is divided in two by the Rybinsk–Bologoye railway line. There are no significant landmarks in the settlement. Economy =Industry= The industrial enterprises in the district are located in Sonkovo and serve the railway station. Additionally, there is a milk production plant. =Transportation= Sonkovo railway station Two railways cross in Sonkovo, which is thus an important railway junction.

It is found in grasslands, savannah, farmland, and woodland. Taxonomy German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin described the species in 1788. The species names is derived from the Ancient Greek words erythros \\"red\\" and pteron \\"wing\\". Alternative common names include crimson- winged parrot and blood-winged parrot. = Subspecies = * Aprosmictus erythropterus erythropterus (Gmelin, 1788) * Aprosmictus erythropterus coccineopterus (Gould,1865) * Aprosmictus erythropterus papua (Mayr & Rand, 1936) Description The red-winged parrot is typically about 30 to 33 cm (12–13 in) in length. Both sexes have bright red wings and a bright green body. The male birds have a black nape, lower blue back and rump with a yellow tip on their tail, an orange bill and grey feet. The female birds have a yellowish-green body and the wings have red and pink trimmings. Also distinguishing the females are dark irises and the lower back is a light blue colour. Juveniles have orange/yellow beaks and pale brown irises, and otherwise resemble females in colouration. Males develop adult plumage at about the age of two years and females at the age of about a year and a half. Distribution and habitat Their range is from the Pilbara, Western Australia to Cape York Peninsula, Queensland (to be seen almost all over Queensland) and as south as northeast South Australia. They are occasionally spotted in south New Guinea. These birds inhabit riverine forests, forest edges, acacia scrub, savanna, mangroves, and farmlands. They are seen often in pairs or flocks near water. Diet Their diet typical consists of seeds from eucalyptus, acacia, berries, flowers, and insects. The birds' call are \\"ching- ching\\", \\"chink-chink\\" or thin screeching.Red-winged Parrot feeding on unknown fruit Breeding File:Aprosmictus erythropterus -Honolulu Zoo, Hawaii, USA-8a.jpgAn immature male at Honolulu Zoo, Hawaii, USA.

A hollow space in a tree at a height of 11 m from the ground usually acts as nest for breeding . Generally, three to six white eggs are laid per season, the eggs being 31 mm in length. The female incubates while the male searches for food. The chicks stay with their parents for about five weeks. It has been hybridised with the Australian king parrot. The hybrid is fertile and breeds true to form.

Todmorden Mills was a small settlement located in the Don River valley in Toronto, Ontario. It started out as a lumber mill in the 1790s. Originally known as \\"Don Mills\\", it grew into a small industrial complex and village before becoming part of East York in the 20th century. Currently the valley site is occupied by the Todmorden Mills Heritage Museum and Arts Centre, which includes the museum, art gallery, a theatre and a forest preserve. History In 1795, the settlement of York in Upper Canada was a small but growing community on the shores of Lake Ontario. To supply construction material, Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe granted land on the Don River to Aaron and Isaiah Skinner for the purpose of building a mill to supply lumber. Simcoe wrote to a friend \\"A mill should be build (sic) thereon\\". A third partner to the Skinner's was their Brother-in-Law, Parsall Terry - husband to their Sister, Rhoda Skinner. Parshall was the first Watermaster on the Don and died in 1808 while trying to cross the Don via horseback during floodstage. He had also been a member of the first Legislature of Upper Canada. Tomorden Mills, c. 1860s; when it was operated by the Taylor family. The mill was operated by the Skinners until about 1855, when it was sold to the Taylor family. In 1820, a brewery (Helliwell or Don Brewery) was built next to the mill and operated by Thomas Helliwell and John Eastwood. The Helliwell family operated it until 1855, when it too was sold to the Taylor family. Todmorden Mills acquired its name from John Eastwood, one of the original brewery owners. His family had emigrated from Todmorden, a town then straddling the two counties of Lancashire and Yorkshire in England. The Taylors owned a number of industrial mills in the neighbourhood including the Don Valley Brick Works. Under their ownership the mill was converted to produce felt paper. The mill continued to operate until the 1920s when the building was converted into a riding stable. In the early 1940s, the site became the location of a small German prisoner of war camp. The camp housed men from the German merchant marine who were interned in Allied ports at the start of the war. The prisoners often worked as labourers at the nearby Don Valley Brick Works. In 1945, the prisoners were repatriated and the camp was shut down. Soon afterwards, the camp buildings were destroyed by fire, likely set by vandals. Between 1930 and 1967, the property housed a collection of horse riding schools and light industry. In the 1930s, the Windermere Riding Academy used the property. Don Vale Textiles occupied the property in the late 1940s. From 1950 and 1963, the Whitewood Riding School was housed at the stables.\\"Todmorden Mills - A Timeline\\", Town Crier, April 2004. During the building of the Don Valley Parkway, the site was extensively modified. The river which used to pass through the site in a wide meander was straightened so that it was entirely cut off from the site. The former riverbed was turned into a pond and the bridge that used to cross the river is now only used to reach a parking lot. The Helliwell House is one of four historic buildings at Tormorden Mills. In 1965, the mill site was proposed as a centennial project by East York's mayor, True Davidson. On May 22, 1967 it was opened as the Todmorden Mills Historic Site and started to function as a community museum. Davidson remained as an honorary curator until her death in 1978. Currently the museum maintains four buildings from the original settlement including the old paper mill which dates from 1825, a brewery and two homes. The Don railway station was moved to Todmorden in 1969, and remained at Todmorden until 2009 when it was moved to Roundhouse Park. In the near future, the museum is hoping to re-restore Helliwell House to resemble its appearance in the 1890s. In 1991, two local naturalists, Charles Sauriol and Dave Money proposed that a small forested area adjacent to the museum site be turned into a nature preserve. A committee was formed and the Todmorden Mills Wildflower Preserve was created. Since then the committee has performed restoration in the forest to remove non-native invasive species and restore flowers and trees native to the Toronto area.

The station is actually located across the Juniata River from Lewistown proper, a little less than one mile south of the center of the borough. It is currently only served by Amtrak's Pennsylvanian, which operates once per day in each direction, though until 2005, Lewistown was served by a second daily train, the Three Rivers (a replacement service for the legendary Broadway Limited), an extended version of the Pennsylvanian that terminated in Chicago. Upon its cancellation, the sole Pennsylvanian marked the first time in Lewistown's railway history that the town was served by just a single, daily passenger train. A station building exists at the stop, which is open before and during train departure times. However, there is no ticket office at this station, as Amtrak closed the ticket office in 1977. The distance between Lewistown and the next station eastward, the Harrisburg Transportation Center, is the longest distance between stations (61 miles) anywhere along the route between Pittsburgh and New York. The station house, according to volunteers that staff it, is the oldest structure built by the Pennsylvania Railroad which is still standing. The current passenger depot was constructed in 1849 as the freight station, while the Pennsylvania used a nearby three story hotel building as the passenger depot until 1868. Operations were moved into the freight station, while the old brick building became a hotel, restaurant, and a Railway Express Agency. That building was demolished in the 1950s, and currently sits as a small lot. \\"J\\" Tower, which was added in the 1870s as a two story-brick tower within the depot, was removed in the 1950s, During restoration of the depot, a replica of \\"J\\" Tower was installed into the building. In December 2019, the Mifflin County Planning Commission announced a two-phase transportation study on the improvements needed to the station and infrastructure, and the transportation and traffic flow. This would be a first step toward possibly reopening Amtrak service to Lewistown on the Keystone Corridor.

Donald Dayton indicates that \\"Probably most influential for a new generation of Holiness scholars has been the work of Nazarene theologian Mildred Bangs Wynkoop, especially her book A Theology of Love: The Dynamic of Wesleyanism.\\" The Wynkoop Center for Women in Ministry located in Kansas City, Missouri is named in her honour. The Timothy L. Smith and Mildred Bangs Wynkoop Book Award of the Wesleyan Theological Society also jointly honours her \\"outstanding scholarly contributions.\\" Personal life Mildred Olive Bangs was born on 9 September 1905 in Seattle, Washington, the daughter of Carl Oliver Bangs (born in Mandal, Norway) and Mery Dupertuis (born in Ollon, Canton de Vaud, Switzerland), both immigrants to the United States. She is the older sister of theologian Carl Bangs (born 5 April 1922 in Seattle, Washington; died 7 July 2002), the author of Arminius: A Study in the Dutch Reformation (New York and Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1971; rev, ed. 1985); and also of Bernice Bangs Morgan, a former evangelist and Methodist home missions pastor in Alaska, who was at one time \\"the only woman minister in Alaska\\", and author of The Very Thought of Thee: Adventures of an Arctic Missionary (1952). She had three other sisters. Wynkoop's parents met Phineas Bresee, General Superintendent of the Church of the Nazarene on their honeymoon and became charter members of Seattle First Church of the Nazarene. Mildred Bangs entered Northwest Nazarene College and travelled in its collegiate quartet with president H. Orton Wiley on the weekends. Two years later, she followed Wiley to Pasadena College, (now Point Loma Nazarene University) to complete her bachelor's degrees. While studying at Pasadena College, Mildred met her future husband, fellow student Ralph Carl Wynkoop (born 5 October 1905 in Omaha, Nebraska; died 3 March 2001 at Kansas City, Missouri). On 27 December 1928 Mildred and Ralph were married at the Central Church of the Nazarene (now the Aurora Church of the Nazarene) in Seattle, Washington. Several ministers officiated at the wedding, including Rev. Alpin Bowes, pastor of the church, and Rev. Elsie Wallace, the first woman ordained by Phineas Bresee in the Church of the Nazarene. Their first home was Pasadena, California, where they were students at Pasadena College. Education Wynkoop initially studied at Northwest Nazarene College (now Northwest Nazarene University) in Nampa, Idaho, where she was a student of Nazarene theologian H. Orton Wiley and biblical scholar Olive Winchester. After Wiley resigned to become president of Pasadena College (now Point Loma Nazarene University), she transferred also to Pasadena College, where she received her A.B. and Th.B. degrees in 1931. She earned a Bachelor of Divinity (B.D.) degree from Western Evangelical Seminary (now George Fox Evangelical Seminary) in 1952. Her thesis was entitled \\"A Biblical Study of Man in His Relationship to the Image of God.\\" Additionally, she earned a M.Sc. from the University of Oregon in 1953; and a Doctorate in Theology (Th.D.) from Northern Baptist Theological Seminary in 1955. Her thesis was entitled \\"A Historical and Semantic Analysis of Methods of Biblical Interpretation as They Relate to Views of Inspiration.\\" Ministry Influenced by early role models like Rev. Mrs. Elsie Wallace, a pastor of Seattle First Church of the Nazarene and briefly superintendent of the Northwest District of the Church of the Nazarene, and by Olive Winchester, theologian and academic dean at Northwest Nazarene College, Wynkoop walked through the doors of ministry that opened to her. =Pastoral Ministry and Evangelism= For about 20 years, until they decided that Mildred would begin graduate studies, the Wynkoops served together as co-pastors or full-time itinerant evangelists. They were co- pastors of the Glassell Park Church of the Nazarene in Los Angeles for four years until her graduation from Pasadena College in 1931, before pastoring the Church of the Nazarene at Ojai, California for a year. Their next pastorate was for four years at Marshfield, Oregon (now Coos Bay). During this pastorate, Mildred was ordained in 1934 as an elder in the Church of the Nazarene by John W. Goodwin, General Superintendent in the Church of the Nazarene, and Ralph was ordained in 1935 by General Superintendent Roy T. Williams. Ralph and Mildred spent the next five years travelling as evangelists, mostly on the West Coast. They moved to Portland, Oregon, to serve the Brentwood Church of the Nazarene for nine years. When Mildred enrolled in doctoral studies in Chicago, Illinois, Ralph returned to evangelistic ministry. =Educational Ministry= Wynkoop's first teaching assignment was at Western Evangelical Seminary (now George Fox Evangelical Seminary) in Portland, Oregon, where she served as Professor of Theology from 1956 to December 1960. From 1961 to 1966 she taught in Japan where she was the founding President of Japan Nazarene Theological Seminary, and briefly in Taiwan. From 1966 to 1976 she served as Professor of Theology and Director of the Department of Missions at Trevecca Nazarene College (now Trevecca Nazarene University) in Nashville, Tennessee. From 1976 to 1979 Wynkoop was the Theologian-in-Residence at Nazarene Theological Seminary in Kansas City, Missouri. Theology Wynkoop's theology has been described as \\"relational theology\\" by Michael Lodahl. Wynkoop's theological agenda was shaped initially by H. Orton Wiley, \\"America's leading exponent of Arminian theology\\". > Wiley understood that the Nazarenes were oriented to the Protestant > Reformation through the Anglican tradition. Stimulated by Wiley, Wynkoop's > brother, Carl Bangs, became a world authority on the Dutch reformer James > Arminius and Arminianism's spread in England and America. Her interests, > however, focused on John Wesley and his relevance for theological life > today. In John Wesley: Christian Revolutionary (1970) Wynkoop showed how the Wesleyan tradition's founder held together two strains torn apart by American fundamentalism: personal piety and social compassion. She urged a return to Wesley's classic formulation. She provided an account of her church's basic theology in Foundations of Wesleyan-Arminian Theology(1967). Six years of missionary service in Taiwan and Japan stimulated Wynkoop's creative thinking on how to best communicate the theology of holiness—a process that resulted in her 1973 magnum opus A Theology of Love, a reinterpretation of the Wesleyan message for her time. Wynkoop was also influenced by the process theology of Daniel Day Williams. In A Theology of Love, she questioned the terminology of a \\"second work of grace.\\" She taught sin was not a substance to be eradicated, but a wrong relationship with God. Wynkoop taught the decisive moment of salvation was justification and that believers received the Holy Spirit at that time. She did not connect the baptism of the Spirit with entire sanctification. Wynkoop advocated: > Ontological trichotomy, a recent revival of Gnostic thought in some > Christian circles, undermines a concept of the unity of personality so > basically assumed in Hebrew thought. It raises no barriers to-in fact it > actually suggests and encourages-a virtual depersonalizing of the self. If > man is only the sum of so many entities, he is simply an aggregate of > selves, a split personality, a double mind; not a responsible, valid, > centralized self. Any pluralistic concept of personality destroys the > foundation of biblical holiness which is characterized by love, and which is > a wholly personal quality capable of being experienced, truly, only by a > unified person. It has always been the most profound conviction of > Wesleyanism that the Bible speaks to the moral relationships of men and not > about sub-rational, non-personal areas of the self. Sin is basically self- > separation from God, not in measurable distance but in moral unlikeness and > spiritual alienation. Holiness is moral to the core -love to God and man- > qualities of the self in relation to the person of God and of men. > Love is the gospel message. Christian love, revealed by God in Christ, is > the correction of man's limited, selfish, selective, perverted love. It > stands against any human concept of love projected into a theory of God's > nature and His way with man. It is precisely this unlimited, impartial, > indestructible love that needed to be \\"revealed\\" because the best in human > love has been limited. The very nature of sin is love's perversion which > makes the self the object of its own dedication. Could the dogma of > particular election as understood by some theological traditions be the > projection of faulty human love into the very nature of God? The gospel was > not born in human philosophy but in God's heart revealed in Christ. This > Wesley declared. > Holiness and love are two different words for two different things. In the > realm of formal definition each is distinct. They cannot be interchangeably > used in any one context. But this is in the realm of words as words. In the > realm of existential meaning something of their relatedness begins to come > through. But it would be inaccurate to say they are \\"related.\\" To say > holiness and love are not identical but related would imply that they were > associated in experience but not vitally and essentially connected in life. > It would say that each has an autonomy apart from the other. Somewhat in the > sense that a house and a home, a person and a lawyer, an institution and a > school can be equated, holiness and love can also be ... When holiness and > love are put together, the analogy of the two sides of a coin would be > closer to the truth. Neither side can be both sides at the same time. Sides > are not to be equated, but the obverse side is as essential to its existence > as the face. Love is the essential inner character of holiness, and holiness > does not exist apart from love. That is how close they are, and in a certain > sense they can be said to be the same thing. At least Wesley consistently > defined holiness, as well as perfection, as love.

He served as government minister and court advisor to Marquis Wen (r. 403–387 BC) in the state of Wei. In 407 BC, he wrote the Book of Law (Fajing, 法经), which was the basis for the codified laws of the Qin and Han dynasties. His political agendas, as well as the Book of Law, had a deep influence on later thinkers such as Han Feizi and Shang Yang, who would later develop the philosophy of Legalism based on Li Kui's reforms. Life and reforms Li Kui was in the service of the Marquis Wen of Wei even before the state of Wei was officially recognised, though little else is known of his early life. He was appointed as Chancellor of the Wei-controlled lands in 422 BC, in order to begin administrative and political reforms; Wei would therefore be the first of the Seven Warring States to embark on the creation of a bureaucratic, rather than a noble-dominated, form of government. The main agendas of Li Kui's reforms included: *The institution of meritocracy, rather than inheritance, as the key principle for the selection of officials. By doing this, Li Kui undermined the nobility while enhancing the effectiveness of government. He was responsible for recommending Ximen Bao to oversee Wei's water conservancy projects in the vicinity of Ye, and recommending Wu Qi as a military commander when Wu Qi sought asylum in Wei. *Giving the state an active role in encouraging agriculture, by 'maximising instruction and agricultural productivity' (盡地力之教). While the precise contents of this reform are unclear, they could have included the spreading of information about agricultural practices, thus encouraging more productive methods of farming. *Instituting the 'Law of Equalising Purchases' (平籴法), wherein the state purchased grain to fill its granaries in years of good harvest, to ease price fluctuations and serve as a guarantee against famine. *Codifying the laws of the state, thus creating the Book of Law. The text was in turn subdivided, with laws dealing with theft, banditry, procedures of arrest and imprisonment, and miscellaneous criminal activities. Legacy The direct result of these pioneering reform measures was the dominance of Wei in the early decades of the Warring States era. Leveraging its improved economy, Wei achieved considerable military successes under Marquis Wen, including victories against the states of Qin between 413 and 409 BC, Qi in 404 BC, and joint expeditions against Chu with Zhao and Han as its allies. At the same time, the main tenets of Li Kui's reforms - supporting law over ritual, agrarian production, meritocratic and bureaucratic government and an active role of the state in economic and social affairs - proved an inspiration for later generations of reform-minded thinkers. When Shang Yang sought service in Qin, three decades after Li Kui's death, he brought with him a copy of the Book of Law, which was eventually adapted and became the legal code of Qin. Along with his contemporary Ximen Bao, he was given oversight in construction of canal and irrigation projects in the State of Wei.Needham, Volume 4, Part 3 261.

Both reagents and samples will be stored in the freezer. As well as storage the freezer is designed to be used to transport samples to and from the ISS in a temperature controlled environment. The total capacity of the unit is 300 litres. Minus Eighty-Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS History The first MELFI unit, FU-1, was flown to the station in 2006 on Space Shuttle mission STS-121, installed in the Destiny Laboratory Module, and commissioned by Thomas Reiter. The MELFI flight units were originally designed to be flown fully powered in the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module, permitting pre-made experiments to be flown to the station without contaminating or destroying any samples. The plan was to cycle the three MELFI units between orbit and Earth. The final MELFI unit was flown to the ISS on board Space Shuttle Discovery during the STS-131 mission in 2010. MELFI description Each dewar is a cylindrical vacuum-insulated 75 litre container and can accommodate samples of a variety of sizes and shapes. The initial delivery of the unit also included a number of spare dewars. MELFI was developed by the European Space Agency. Two units have been supplied to NASA and one to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). In addition ground units for training, experiment preparation, and use in control experiments have been built.\\"STS-121 Nasa Press Kit\\" NASA Press Kit - STS-121, May 2006. *Weight: 730 kg (1609 pounds) *Design lifetime: 10 years.

Until 2005, Huntingdon was served by a second daily train, the Three Rivers (a replacement service for the legendary Broadway Limited), an extended version of the Pennsylvanian that terminated in Chicago. Upon its cancellation, the sole Pennsylvanian marked the first time in Huntingdon's railway history that the town was served by just a single, daily passenger train.

The house provides a location where youths are free to hang out, spending their time by attending concerts, playing Foosball and socializing with their friends. In the weekends, concerts with bands (usually local or regional punk-bands) like Rama Lama -das Pönkabteilung, Mob 47, Brutal Kuk, Bitre Barn, Tomrom are held. Political stance  UFFA is politically active and has, among other things, participated in anti-racist demonstrations and demonstrations against the NATO summit in Åre. They are against racism, homophobia, sexual discrimination and capitalism. In contrast to the attitude of the Marxist Blitz in Oslo, UFFA is predominantly anarchist in view, and has locally been clearly less militant than Blitz has been in Oslo. This approach was made possible through the decision of the Trondheim police and politicians to take a relatively pragmatic approach to the phenomenon of youthful autonomy. Trøndelag has an extended, far-reaching radical tradition which informed the municipal approach in setting up a relationship with UFFA, and harsh confrontations, as between the conservative management of Oslo municipality and Blitz, were avoided. UFFA's external positions promoting anarchy and autonomy are in clear contrast to their marked willingness to cooperate internally on political and administrative matters, both in relation to the UFFA-house and in the nearby Svartlamo neighborhood. The balanced local approach does not completely suppress strong political action. In December 2006 people from both UFFA and Blitz participated in the violent demonstrations supporting their compatriots from Ungdomshuset in Copenhagen, and several were arrested. Protestors from UFFA and Svartlamo blocked traffic on Trondheim's streets but let public transport through. The demonstration picketed the Danish Consulate.  History  UFFA was established in 1981, and has been in operation ever since. The original location in Kjøpmannsgata burned down in 1982. UFFA signed an agreement with Trondheim municipality and resumed activities shortly afterwards at the current premises on Innherredsveien (taking over the defunct Østbyen kindergarten). UFFA was established as an independent place, where everyone can do what they want. Founding members talked about how in the 1980s there was nothing for young people to do in Trondheim. UFFA includes a number of facilities that encourage youth to seek their own identity and structure. One example is the Ivar Matlaus Bokkafé. The café is named after a Norwegian anarchist named Ivar Mortensson-Egnund, who among other things, lectured the Norwegian people about politics, religion and social issues. One of the lectures he held was named “Matløysa i Noreg”. Translated to English it means “Foodless in Norway”. After this lecture he was called “Ivar Matlaus” – or “Foodless Ivar” in English.  Activities  At UFFA the youth are enabled to do whatever they have an interest in. Participant can, as an example, form a theater group, participate in political meetings, paint graffiti, be a chef in their café, or \\"run around naked and scream like an elephant.\\" Specific activities include: * Kafè Knaillhard - city hardest vegetarian cafe - youth are encouraged to participate * Ivar Matlaus Bokkafé (named after the Norwegian anarchist nicknamed Ivar Matlaus) - a bookstore and cafe which specializes in selling underground music, fanzines, political literature, etc. * Aksjonsgruppa [AG-UFFA] - The \\"action group\\" organizes of demonstration and political activism * Bandgruppa - The \\"band group\\" operates the practice room * Lydgruppa - provides technical support including light and sound for concerts and maintenance of audio equipment * Bookinggruppa - The \\"booking group\\" books bands and organizes concerts * Pressegruppa - The \\"press group\\" promotes concerts, prepares and maintains websites, develops press releases, etc. * Stuntfilm - arranges both weekly and special film showings at UFFA and promotes film production  See also  *Blitz (movement) in Oslo *Freetown Christiania in Copenhagen *Hausmania in Oslo *Kafé 44 in Stockholm *Ungdomshuset in Copenhagen  References  Politics of Norway Anarchist communities Event venues established in 1981 ","title":"UFFA"},{"id":"5790578","text":"TELE N was a Venezuelan regional news network based in the western Venezuelan city of Maracaibo in the Zulia State.

For a long time, Metro was the sole free newspaper available in the different metropolitan areas. In 2002, the Bonnier group launched Stockholm City in the Stockholm region. City expanded into Gothenburg and Malmö in September 2006 and was followed a few weeks later by the Schibsted-backed Punkt SE in all three cities. City Göteborg was closed down in late 2007. In May 2008 Metro had reached an agreement with Schibsted that meant that Punkt SE would be closed down and Schibsted would buy a 35 percent share of Metro Sweden. In the period of 2001-2002 Metro had a circulation of 384,000 copies. Hard hit by the introduction of smart phones, which led morning commuters and other key groups of readers to follow news on cell phones instead of picking up free newspapers, Metro's finances grew increasingly strained in the 2000s.

Early life and education He was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and his father Hugh rowed for England at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, winning a bronze medal in the eight-oared race. Porter began his rowing career in his second year at the University of Victoria. Athletic career Porter won his gold medal in the 1992 Summer Olympics, stroking the Canadian Men's Eight. In a photo finish, the Canadian boat won by 0.14 seconds, just nipping Romania, with two-time defending World Champion Germany just 1.5 seconds back in third. Prior to the 1992 Olympics, Porter had rowed in the Canadian men's eight at the 1990 and 1991 World Championships, finishing second to Germany each time. Following the 1992 Olympics, Porter took up sculling. In 1993, he won the Single Scull event at the World Rowing Championships, and was one of the favorites at the 1996 Summer Olympics; Porter led most of the race, only to be passed by Xeno Müller in the last 500 meters. Porter held on to win the silver medal ahead of two- time defending Olympic champion Thomas Lange, who finished third. Following that achievement, Porter was awarded the Order of British Columbia in 1996. Following the 1996 Olympics, Porter devoted himself to chiropractic school, and finished twelfth and thirteenth at the 1997 and 1998 World Championships, respectively. In 1999, Porter devoted more practice time to rowing and would go on to place third at the 1999 World Championship in the single scull behind Muller and Rob Waddell. One of the most anticipated rowing events at the 2000 Olympics was men's single scull. In addition to Porter, it featured two-time World Champion Rob Waddell, defending Olympic champion and three-time World Championship silver medalist Xeno Müller, and rising star Marcel Hacker. The race lived up to the hype. Porter finished fourth in the closest Olympic race ever, little over 2 seconds separated first from fourth. =Retirement from Olympics= Following the 2000 Olympics, Porter retired from rowing and kept in shape by running triathlons. In 2003, he was inducted into the University of Victoria hall of fame. Porter then started rowing again, winning the 2006 Canadian national team trials event in the single scull. Porter had planned to team with fellow Olympian Jake Wetzel in the double scull event at the 2006 World Championship, and possibly the 2008 Olympics, but shortly before the Canadian Speed Order trials, Wetzel hurt his back preventing the boat from competing at the 2006 World Championships. In 2012, Porter was inducted into the Canadian sports hall of fame. Personal life Currently, Porter is a chiropractor living in Vancouver, British Columbia with his wife, Helen Rhee- Porter.

Elena Quiroga (1921-1995) was a Spanish writer renowned for her narrative prose work. She was considered as one of the most prominent women of her time, mostly because she was preoccupied by injustice, and explored the themes of childhood and adolescence. She was the second woman to enter the Real Academia Española (Royal Academy of the Spanish Language) from 1944 to 1983.  Biography  Born into a wealthy family, Elena Quiroga lived with her father in Villoria (Galicia), and was a happy child and teenager. During her time, it was quite uncommon for women to get access to education. However, Elena Quiroga was given a high level of academic training. For that reason, ever since she was a child, she could develop her inner literary sensitivity. We can see that in her first novel that she published when she was 20, La Soledad Sonora (1949), in which she narrates the story of a woman from her adolescence until the end of her life. Even though she did not go to University, Quiroga attended free classes, and worked for many years, 4 to 5 hours a day on her books and texts. After she married Dalmiro de Válgoma in 1950, they moved to Madrid where she had the opportunity to enter a group of writers. They are known for having reinvented the contemporary Spanish novel of the 20th century. On August 31, she was hospitalized in La Coruña because of a serious injury, where she died of a brain disease at the age of 74.  Career  While she started writing at a young age, it was only when she got married that her career really began. When she moved to Madrid, she wrote an award-winning novel, Viento del Norte (1950), which is about the relationship between a young maid and her master. In this novel, Quiroga defines the keys of her following writing. Some of them are the use of intimacy about the memories of the childhood and adolescence and a well-defined plot and characters. She uses a rich, elegant and pure language in her prose. In 1952, she wrote her third novel: La Sangre. According to her editors, it gave her the status of being an extraordinary novelist because of the delicacy of her style and the interest of the problems that she deals with. It tells the story of four generations through a tree, the true main character of the book. In 1954, Quiroga wrote Algo pasa en la calle, where she explores new and more current areas of the genre of the novel. The novel deals with love failure and a marriage break up that are settled in urban spaces. Its characters are psychologically more complex and close to the mentality of modern men. Elena Quiroga published La Careta (1995) and La Enferma (1955), where she talks about the story of a woman who deals with psychological problems and who is abandoned by his lover. She also wrote Plácida la joven y otras narraciones (1956) and La última corrida (1958). That makes a total of eight novels published in less than ten years. This fact made her one of the most prolific Spanish writers of the moment without losing quality in her prose. After years of an intense literary activity, her production of novels took a slower rhythm. In 1960, she published Tristura, a novel that won the award Premio de la Crítica Catalana. However, it took her five years to write another novel: Escribo tu nombre (1965), Other novels written by her are Trayecto uno, El pájaro de oro, La otra ciudad, Presente profundo (1970) and Grandes Soledades (1983). Elena Quiroga belongs to a generation of writers whose stories about the Spanish Civil War incremented the psychological deepness in the women's testimony in that topic. = Real Academia Española = In 1983, Elena Quiroga was elected as a member of the Real Academia Española because of her brilliant career and her publications. She was the second woman in history who achieved this membership, after Carmen Conde, a writer who entered in this institution in 1978. It was very important for the Real Academia Española the inclusion of women in their institution. Works * La soledad sonora. Madrid: Espasa Calpe, 1949. * Viento del norte.

Haga Palace (), formerly known as the Queen's Pavilion (), is located in the Haga Park, Solna Municipality in Metropolitan Stockholm, Sweden. The palace, built between 18021805, was modelled after ballet-master Gallodiers Italian villa in Drottningholm by architect Carl Christoffer Gjörwell on appointment by King Gustaf IV Adolf for the royal children. It has been the home or summerhouse for several members of the Swedish royal family – most notably it was the birthplace of the present King – until 1966 when King Gustaf VI Adolf transferred its disposal to the government and it was turned into a guesthouse for distinguished foreign official visitors. In 2009, it was announced by Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt that the rights of disposal to the palace would be transferred back to the royal court to be used by Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and her husband, Prince Daniel, Duke of Västergötland, as a wedding gift in 2010. They moved into Haga Palace after their wedding on 19 June that year. History When King Gustaf III was killed in 1792 the work on his grandiose castle at Brunnsviken was cancelled and his son and successor King Gustav IV Adolf instead started building a more modest palace. The King turned to relatively young architect Carl Christoffer Gjörwell with the aim to build a modern house in Italian villa style. Gjörwell had been employed at Haga since 1788 and had studied for Louis Jean Desprez both at the erection of the royal pavilion and with the incomplete castle in Brunnsviken. He was also the architect behind the Echo Temple. He modelled it after ballet-master Gallidiers Italian villa at Drottningholm which Gjörwell had design himself. The foundation was laid-out in May 1802 and already before the end of the year the building was under roof. Building contractor was Herman Edberg who, aside from having skilled craftsmen as bricklayers and carpenters also had a group of infantrymen from Södermanlands regemente at his disposal. In December 1803 The King was informed that the stands were removed and the marble columns were raised. The columns were originally from Finland and had been brought to Poland during the reign of King Sigismund. They were taken back to Sweden by King Gustaf II Adolf and used by Nicodemus Tessin the Younger in the building of the German Church in Karlskrona. When the Church was rebuilt after a massive fire in 1790 14 columns were left available for future use. The floor was made out of oak from Fredrikhovs Castle and the stone was originally intended for King Gustav III:s never completed castle at Brunnsviken. The whole interior was finished at the end of 1805. Floor plan for Haga Palace from the first half of the nineteenth-century. From the 1820s the palace was used as a summer house for Crown Prince Oscar and his consort Josephine. In the 1860 the palace was renovated for King Oscar I's youngest son Prince August and his wife Princess Therese. The Princess lived at Haga Palace until her demise in 1914 and she put her touch to the Palace during her 54-year-long dwelling. After the death of Therese the palace was put into disuse by the members of the Royal Family until the newly wedded couple Hereditary Prince Gustaf Adolf and Princess Sibylla relocated there in 1932 after some thorough renovation had been conducted. The Princesses Margaretha, Birgitta, Desiree and Christina and Prince Carl Gustaf, Sweden's present King, were all born there. In the wake of the sudden death of the Hereditary Prince in an KLM DC-3 airplane crash at Copenhagen Airport on January 26, 1947, the widowed mother and her children ended their full-time residency at the palace. King Gustaf VI Adolf relinquished the royal disposal rights to the Palace and released it to be used by the Government in 1966 as an official residence for distinguished foreign guests of the Government to Sweden, although it would turn out to be rather sparsely used for that purpose. On April 23, 2009, Prime Minister Reinfeldt announced that the disposal rights to Haga Palace will be transferred back to the Royal Court as a wedding gift from the government in light of Crown Princess Victoria's approved marriage to Daniel Westling in June 2010. The couple moved in on November 15, 2010.

She made her first appearance during the episode broadcast on 7 July 1988. Bronwyn is the sister of Sharon Davies. Bronwyn fell in love with Henry Ramsay and when he left for New Zealand, she followed him not long after. Bronwyn departed on 22 February 1990. Casting After Kylie Minogue, who played Charlene Robinson, announced her departure, the serial's producers decided that they needed to replace her with a similar actress. They were planning to start a nationwide search when they discovered Rachel Friend. Friend was eighteen when she joined the cast, and she chose to postpone her university degree to play Bronwyn. Her casting was announced in June 1988, and she told a reporter for The Sun-Herald, \\"I'm a bit overwhelmed by it all but I think I'm going to like working on Neighbours.\\" Friend was initially contracted to appear in a few episodes, but viewer reaction to her character was so positive that she was given a one-year contract. Development Bronwyn is a country girl. In her fictional backstory, she had to give up her schooling when her mother died and she had to take on several new responsibilities, which made her \\"pretty domestic\\". Friend described her as \\"practical, sensible and quite serious.\\" Friend thought she was more outgoing than Bronwyn, who she called a \\"hick\\" and said she was too quiet. In October 1989, Darren Devlyn of TV Week confirmed that Friend had decided to quit the serial. Her decision came shortly after her partner and co-star Craig McLachlan relocated to Sydney to join the cast of fellow soap opera Home and Away. Friend said it was \\"a career decision\\", as she wanted to try other things. She filmed her final scenes in December. On- screen, Bronwyn moves to New Zealand to be with Mclachlan's character Henry Ramsay, whom she later marries. Storylines Bronwyn was born in Narrabri, New South Wales, to Gordon (Tim Robertson) and Katherine Davies. Katherine died when Bronwyn was fourteen and her aunt Edith Chubb (Irene Inescort) helped raise her and her sister, Sharon Davies (Jessica Muschamp). Bronwyn moves to Erinsborough to begin a course in childcare. One day she finds toddler Jamie Clarke (S.J. Dey) alone at a supermarket and she criticises his father Des Clarke (Paul Keane) for being careless. Bronwyn attends an interview for a position as a nanny and is shocked when the interviewer turns out to be Des. In spite of this, Des and Bronwyn put their differences aside and he invites her to move in. Bronwyn begins dating Mike Young (Guy Pearce), but their relationship crumbles after she feels out of place with Mike's university friends Jackie Vidor (Shona Ford) and Brad Fuller (Scott Snibson). Bronwyn moves in with Nell Mangel (Vivean Gray) and Jane Harris (Annie Jones) and is later joined by Sharon. Henry Ramsay takes an interest in Bronwyn and she falls for him too. Bronwyn invites him over for dinner, which he accepts. However, when Henry reveals that he has invited Jane and Joe Mangel (Mark Little) too, Bronwyn shoves Henry causing him to fall down some steps, knocking him unconscious. Bronwyn panics and professes her love for Henry, which he hears when he wakes up. After Edith arrives in Erinsborough to keep an eye on her nieces, Henry and Bronwyn begin looking for their own place. Henry's mother, Madge (Anne Charleston), agrees to let the couple stay with her and husband Harold (Ian Smith). Mike offers to tutor Bronwyn for her exams, while Henry is away helping his sister repair her house. Mike makes a move on Bronwyn and they share a kiss. Harold sees them and tells Madge, who confronts Bronwyn. When Henry returns from Brisbane, he finds out and they split up, but decide to remain friends. Bronwyn starts receiving poison pen letters and Henry agrees to help catch the culprit. After Henry fails and is caught with the evidence, Bronwyn is convinced it is him. It later emerges that Bronwyn's ex-boyfriend from Narrabri is responsible. Bronwyn and Henry get back together and become engaged. On the day of the wedding, Gordon arrives and tries to talk Bronwyn out of marrying Henry and he is successful to a degree. Bronwyn tells Henry she will marry him, just not on that day. After Henry takes a job as a DJ in New Zealand, Bronwyn misses him and when she is heard talking to \\"Henry\\", Madge and Harold worry for her sanity, but they discover Henry is a Possum she found. Bronwyn takes a job as a veterinarian in New Zealand and she joins Henry. The couple later marry. Reception For her portrayal of Bronwyn, Friend won the Logie Award for Most Popular Actress in 1990. During a feature on past Neighbours characters, telecommunications network Orange, described Bronwyn's most memorable moment as: \\"Accidentally pushing good pal Henry Ramsay (played by Craig McLachlan) down some steps. Believing the mulleted larrikin was unconscious, Bronwyn rushed to his side and professed her undying love for him – whereupon Henry opened his eyes and admitted he felt the same. Aaah!\\" Ruth Deller, of entertainment website Lowculture, said Bronwyn was \\"sweet.\\" The BBC said Bronwyn's most notable moment was \\"Meeting Henry Ramsay.\\" References Neighbours characters Fictional nannies Television characters introduced in 1988 Female characters in television ","title":"Bronwyn Davies"},{"id":"5790711","text":"Cynthia Leitich Smith (born 1967) is a New York Times best-selling author of fiction for children and young adults.

She made her first appearance on 29 July 1988. Sharon is the younger sister of Bronwyn Davies (Rachel Friend). During her time in Neighbours, Sharon's storylines included setting fire to the coffee shop, a love triangle with Lucy Robinson (Sasha Close) and Nick Page (Mark Stevens), pushing Lucy into a swimming pool and developing an eating disorder. The character was written out in 1990 as part of a cast exodus and she made her final appearance on 7 June 1990. Casting While completing her VCE in 1988, Muschamp successfully auditioned for the part of Sharon Davies. Muschamp said she thought the audition would be a good experience and that she did not expect to get the role. During her time with Neighbours, Muschamp said she \\"had a ball\\" working with the other members of the cast. In 1990, during a cast exodus, producers decided to send the character to New Zealand. By that time, everyone around Sharon had gone – her boyfriend, her sister and her aunt. Of this, Muschamp said \\"I think the producers felt her character had come to a natural conclusion, so she went off to stay with relatives.\\" Of the process, which saw characters leave, Muschamp explained \\"They had the head-shots of all the different characters lined up above the mirrors and as people left, they'd turn them upside down, I remember dreading the day my head got turned\\". Muschamp left the series in May of that year and she struggled to find work following her departure. She added \\"Neighbours was a double-edged sword, in many ways it opened a lot of doors but in other ways people thought I couldn't do anything else\\". Development Sharon is described as a \\"impetuous, laid back character.\\" She is bubbly, but tactless. Sharon often insults people, but she does not mean to and she can be a little thoughtless. Muschamp explained that she is not like Sharon at all, but that she likes her character. She said \\"She has a lot of boyfriends, more than me! – a different once every week.\\" She added \\"Sharon comes from a dusty isolated town and wants to come to the bright lights of the city.\\" Woman magazine called Sharon a \\"naughty teenager\\". In one of the character's more notable storylines, she attempts to lose weight by dieting. Muschamp said the storyline was created after she decided to lose weight herself. When she was asked if the producers had asked her to lose weight, Muschamp said \\"Not at all. I was always a chubby teenager. Then after I left school, when I was already in Neighbours, I put on more weight. I decided to lose it and so they put Sharon dieting into the storyline.\\" While discussing controversial topics covered by Neighbours, producer Mark Callan told Jim Schembri of The Age that the crew were not sure whether they should go ahead with the plot, as it \\"would probably cause a bit of a personal concern\\" with Muschamp, but Callan praised her for coping with it \\"magnificently\\". He added \\"That was considered cruel at the time, and it was cruel the way that we handled it, yet I feel that the end product was something that was very real. The character, Sharon, had a real problem that she expressed very well.\\" Storylines Sharon leaves home to find her sister Bronwyn (Rachel Friend), but as she does not leave a note, Bronwyn is shocked to hear that her sister has run away. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) catches Sharon leaving the Coffee Shop without paying for her meal and makes her work in the kitchen to pay for it. Sharon later turns up in Ramsay Street to see Bronwyn and Mrs Mangel (Vivean Gray) agrees to let Sharon stay with her, Bronwyn, and Jane Harris (Annie Jones). Sharon manages to upset Mrs Mangel with her attitude and she is almost thrown out when she breaks Mrs Mangel's organ. Sharon befriends Todd Landers (Kristian Schmid) and they get themselves into trouble, she also begins dating Nick Page (Mark Stevens). Sharon's aunt, Edith Chubb (Irene Inescort), shows up and tries to persuade her to come home, but she later agrees to let her stay. When Sharon is closing up the Coffee Shop one day, Vanessa Bailey (Gretchen Zoland) and Pam Muir (Pia Podporin), two girls from school arrive and offer her a cigarette. When the girls leave, Sharon throws the lit cigarette in the bin. Des Clarke (Paul Keane) later finds the kitchen on fire and he rushes inside with a fire extinguisher. The shop blows up and Des is rescued by Harold. Nick initially takes the blame for Sharon, but she admits the truth to Harold, who lets her keep her job. When Lucy Robinson (Sasha Close) returns from boarding school, she develops a crush on Nick. After seeing Lucy flirting with Nick, Sharon pushes her into a swimming pool. The two girls became enemies for a time, until they were asked to make up by their guardians. Edith rents her house to Hilary Robinson (Anne Scott-Pendlebury) and her son, Matt Robinson (Ashley Paske). Not long after, Sharon becomes obsessed about her weight and she stops eating for a long time. One day at Lassiter's, she falls face down into the pond and is rescued by Matt and Hilary. Sharon is reassured over her weight and she starts eating regularly again. Sharon decides to spend all her time at the beach, but she does not use the right sun protection and suffers from heat stroke. She then starts to think of other ways to get tanned. She puts on some tan lotion, straightens her hair and wears Bronwyn's best dress to impress a surfer. Sharon begins seeing a different guy every week and she only stops when she is called names at school. Bronwyn goes to New Zealand to be with Henry Ramsay (Craig McLachlan), leaving Sharon devastated. She moves in with the Bishops, but later decides to move to New Zealand to live with her sister. Reception The character of Sharon was popular with the boys and when she departed from the show, a writer for Woman said \\"There's no doubt that a few thousand teenage boys' hearts will break when Sharon says goodbye to Ramsay Street.\\" The BBC said Sharon's most notable moment was \\"Causing the Coffee Shop to blow up!\\" In Neighbours: The Official Annual 1991, authors John McCready and Nicola Furlong said Muschamp had made her mark on Neighbours. They added \\"The love lives of those such as Nick Page and Sharon Davies have made the programme perhaps the most popular viewing for teenagers around the world.\\" Jane Noone from TV Guide branded Sharon a \\"bubbly\\" character who was always getting into trouble with Nick.

They live on the roots of plants of the family Solanaceae, such as potatoes and tomatoes. PCN cause growth retardation and, at very high population densities, damage to the roots and early senescence of plants. The nematode is not indigenous to Europe but originates from the Andes. Fields are free from PCN until an introduction occurs, after which the typical patches, or hotspots, occur on the farmland. These patches can become full field infestations when unchecked. Yield reductions can average up to 60% at high population densities. Medium scale distribution of the potato cyst nematode: \\"hotspot\\" or \\"infestation focus\\". Primary hotspot (introduction into the field) and two secondary hotspots (caused by cultivation). Each square = 1m2 Biology and life cycle The eggs hatch in the presence of Solanoeclepine A, a substance secreted by the roots of host plants otherwise known as root exudates. The nematodes hatch when they grow into a second-stage juvenile (J2). At this stage, the J2 nematodes find host cells to feed off of. The potato cyst nematodes are endoparasites meaning they go completely into the root to feed. Access to the root cells is gained through piercing through the cell wall using the nematode’s stylet. After a feeding tube has been established, a syncytium begins to form through the breakdown of multiple cell walls adjacent to each other. J2 nematodes continue to feed until they grow into third-stage juveniles (J3), then fourth-stage juveniles (J4), and finally reach the adult stage. The shape of the J3 females begins to appear more like a sac as the female grows into a J4 nematode. At the J4 stage, the body of the female nematode lies outside of the root while the head remains inside the cell. During this stage, the male nematodes become motile again and are then able to fertilize the female nematodes leading to embryos developing inside the female body. Once the female is fertilized, the female dies and leaves a protective cyst containing 200-500 eggs. Once the cysts detach from the original hosts, they remain in the soil until they find another suitable host beginning the cycle again. Cyst nematodes are monocyclic because they have one life cycle per season. Potato cyst nematodes can be detected by their patchy distribution in the field. The specific distribution is caused by the limited spread of these nematodes. Most potato cyst nematodes don’t migrate very far across a field because of their feeding patterns. Both susceptible and resistant potato varieties will suffer from growth retardation at low and medium populations densities. At very high population densities mechanical damage of the root system will occur. The female individuals swell up and appear as cysts on the surface of the roots, each containing up to 400 eggs. In temperate zones only one generation per year will occur. In the Mediterranean countries sometimes a second generation is reported. Cysts can then also be found on the skin of the tubers. Each year without host a certain fraction of the eggs will hatch (spontaneous hatch). The eggs can survive for up to 20 years inside these cysts. Pest control The speed of spread of the nematodes from field to field can be reduced by cleaning equipment of possibly infested soil before changing location and by using only certified PCN-free seed tubers. If possible, ask for seed potatoes grown on fields which were declared free of the potato cyst nematode using an AMI-intensive soil sampling scheme (currently only available in The Netherlands). Pesticides can be used, but they will not get a field free of nematodes. They will increase yields and are only profitable at high population densities, when the financial profit of the extra yield will surpass the cost of the pesticide application. Crop rotation with at least 6 years between planting of a susceptible crop is an effective means to reduce nematode population densities to below damage threshold. However, the best way to manage potato cyst nematodes is the use of (partial) resistant potato varieties. During the last 10 years a number of varieties have been developed which can keep both potato cyst nematode species below damage and detection threshold, without the use of pesticides. Other methods of pest control include nematicides such as fosthiazate. Fosthiazate is applied directly to the soil in specific time intervals. The level of toxicity is important to consider when applying and depends on the manufacturer and the specific instructions of application. The use of certified disease free seed will also assure that potato cyst nematodes are not present due to planting infected tubers. Soil testing for potato cyst nematodes is also crucial in keeping track of the prevalence of the nematodes. Controlling the quantity of the nematodes allows the prevention of an epidemic. Lastly, resistance to potato cyst nematode has been found in Solanum acaule. The downside is that Solanum acaule is a wild potato species containing high glycoalkaloid content making it toxic for consumers. Importance Potato cyst nematodes have the ability to cause a large scale devastation in crops due to the massive amounts of nematode embryos in each cyst. Many continents across the world such as Australia, North America, Asia, Europe, and Africa have had many epidemics of potato cyst nematodes that continue to persist year after year. Potato cyst nematodes are important economically due to the fact that they reduce the crop yield exceedingly. A species of potato cyst nematodes called pale cyst nematodes (Globodera pallida) are able to cause 80% yield loss in a potato field if left untreated. On a more global scale, the Australian potato industry is worth about AUD$500 million yearly which equates to $340 million U.S. dollars. Other countries that are mass producers of potatoes are China with 88.9 million metric tons produced annually, India with 45.34 million metric tons produced annually, and Russia with 30.20 million metric tons produced annually. The continual spread of potato cyst nematodes alludes more economical depression in many major potato producing countries. The official recommendations and requirements for crop rotation vary between countries.

It was developed from the company's C-119 Flying Boxcar, and was unique in the unconventional use of removable cargo pods that were attached below the fuselage, instead of possessing an internal cargo compartment. Design and development The XC-120 Packplane began as a C-119B fuselage (48-330, c/n 10312) which was cut off at a point just below the flight deck. The wings were angled upwards between the engines and the fuselage, raising the fuselage by several feet and giving the plane an inverted gull wing appearance. Smaller diameter \\"twinned\\" wheels were installed forward of each of the main landing gear struts to serve as nosewheels, while the main struts were extended backwards. All four landing gear units, in matching \\"nose\\" and \\"main\\" sets, could be raised and lowered in a scissorlike fashion to lower the aircraft and facilitate the removal of a planned variety of wheeled pods which would be attached below the fuselage for the transport of cargo. The goal was to allow cargo to be preloaded into the pods; it was claimed that such an arrangement would speed up loading and unloading cargo. Production aircraft were to be designated C-128. Operational history Only one XC-120 was built. Though the aircraft was tested extensively and made numerous airshow appearances in the early 1950s the project went no further. It was tested by the Air Proving Ground Command at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in 1951,Staff, \\"XC-120 Goes to Eglin for Tests\\", Aviation Week, 11 June 1951, Vol. 54, No. 24, p. 15. before the project was abandoned in 1952.

Flamingo was originally identified as a Drosophila protein involved in planar cell polarity. Mammals have three flamingo homologs, CELSR1, CELSR2, CELSR3. In mice all three have distinct expression patterns in the brain. Adhesion G protein coupled receptors The adhesion-GPCR family has over thirty members in the human genome. The adhesion GPCRs are seven transmembrane helix proteins that have long N-terminal domains. For example, flamingo has EGF-like, Laminin G-like and Cadherin-like sequences in its N-terminal extracellular domain. Axon fascicles Mice that lack CELSR3 have altered bundling of axons to form fascicles. Function in dendrite morphology In Drosophila, flamingo mutants were found to have abnormal dendrite branching, outgrowth and routing. Kimura et al. proposed that flamingo regulates dendrite branch elongation and prevents the dendritic trees of adjacent Drosophila sensory neurons from having overlap of dendritic arbors. A study of mammalian flamingo homolog CELSR2 found that it is involved in the regulation of dendrite growth. RNAi was used to alter CELSR2 expression in cortical and cerebral brain slice cultures. The dendrites of pyramidal neurons in cortical cultures and Purkinje neurons in cerebellar cultures were simplified when CELSR2 expression was reduced.

His career started in the early 1980s with Wim Stevenhagen under the pseudonym Prutspruts (\\"fiddle- fiddle\\"), which later changed to Prutswerk (\\"lousy job\\"). In the early stages he worked with the later Dutch musician Fay Lovsky. The first comic they brought out, titled De Ironische Man (\\"The Ironic Man\\") did not prove to be very successful, however the (now) duo went on producing comics such as Bert J. Prulleman and Pruts Pruts, Privat Kreye for the alternative magazine De Vrije Balloen. In this time the Familie Doorzon was born. In 1984 the duo broke up, and Gerrit de Jager continued the familie Doorzon series, turning it into a huge success. His loose style, together with ruthless satire on the Dutch society gained the position of the most popular cartoonists.  Style and Satire The success of De Familie Doorzon is largely due to the perfect satire on Dutch society and family life, with every majority and minority represented and no one spared. From the transvestite barkeeper (Rinus) to the dope peddling Ronnie D. and his voluptuous sister and her black husband, every nook and cranny of the Dutch welfare state (as personified by Emiel) and its workforce (the Biereco's) is mercilessly ridiculed. Gerrit de Jager has a quite distinct style, characterized by a love for ridiculous situations, which frequently result in disaster. A good example of this is the inevitable falling over of buildings if the Biereco's (see illustration) had anything to do with it. Although he is milder in his other comics, the common denominator is a good sense for the inevitable madness of social conventions.  Influence  This is larger than one would expect for a \\"mere\\" comic artist. References to the Biereco's and verherbouwingen (They're specialized in \\"prereconstruction\\") are perfectly understood by nearly everyone younger than 40. Telling someone he reacts like Pa Doorzon amounts to more than just a little insult. His constant barrage of jokes on the combination of sex, politics and faith (and all the hypocrisy it takes to keep them aligned) has frequently acted as a monitor of everyday Dutch life, albeit through a distorting mirror. *De familie Doorzon - De Nieuwe Revu *Roel en zijn Beestenboel  Jippo *Mik - Margriet *Liefde en Geluk  Het Parool  Sources  *Nederlandse Stripgeschiedenis *Ibid. *Comiclopedia 1954 births Living people Dutch comics artists Dutch comics writers Dutch humorists Dutch satirists Artists from Amsterdam Winners of the Stripschapsprijs ","title":"Gerrit de Jager"},{"id":"5790798","text":"Lazaro Aguiar Valvassoura is the pastor of the Campinas Central Church of the Nazarene in Campinas, Brazil.Holiness Today Online September/October 2004.

I like 'Sign of the Times.'

Clark introduced \\"A Sign of the Times\\" on The Ed Sullivan Show broadcast of 27 February 1966. The single would debut on the Billboard Hot 100 dated 26 March 1966 and reached its peak of #11 that 23 April. It peaked at #2 on Billboard's \\"Easy Listening\\" survey. Beginning with her American breakout, \\"Downtown,\\" Clark's singles had all had higher chart peaks in the US than in the UK. (The 1966 #23 UK hit \\"You're the One\\" was not released in the US.) \\"A Sign of the Times\\" became the most extreme example of this discrepancy by spending only one week – that of 27 April 1966 – in the UK Top 50 at #49. Although this trend was reversed with Clark's next single: \\"I Couldn't Live Without Your Love\\" (UK #6/US #9), Clark's last two 1966 single releases: \\"Who Am I?\\" (US #21) and \\"Colour My World\\" (US #16) both failed to rank in the UK Top 50. \\"A Sign of the Times\\" was a hit in Australia (#11) and South Africa (#2).

Since the 1971 war, it has become a pejorative term (implying traitor) in Bangladesh due to the numerous atrocities committed by the Razakars during the War. The Razakar force was composed of mostly anti-Bangladesh and pro-Pakistan Bengalis and Urdu-speaking migrants who lived in Bangladesh at the time. Creation The East Pakistan Razakars Ordinance was promulgated on 2 August 1971 by the Governor of East Pakistan, Lieutenant General Tikka Khan. The Ordinance stipulated the creation of a voluntary force to be trained and equipped by the Provincial Government. This was to add to the government's forces to suppress the rebellion of people who wanted independence for the region. It is also alleged that Razakars were recruited by the Shanti Committee, which was formed by several pro-Pakistani leaders including Nurul Amin, Ghulam Azam and Khwaja Khairuddin.The Wall Street Journal, 27 July 1971; quoted in the book Muldhara 71 by Moidul Hasan The first recruits included 96 Jamaat party members, who started training in an Ansar camp at Shahjahan Ali Road, Khulna. During the 1971 Bangladesh genocide by the Pakistani Army and its supporting militias (Razakar) killed estimated between 300,000 to 3,000,000 people and raped 200,000–400,000 Bangladeshi women in a systematic campaign of genocidal rape.White, Matthew, Death Tolls for the Major Wars and Atrocities of the Twentieth Century Organisation The Razakars had two branches they were Al-Badr and Al-Shams paramilitary forces. Students from Madrasahs were inducted into Al-Badr for specialised operations while Al-Shams was tasked with protection of important strategic locations. The Razakar were under Pakistani Army command and also trained by them (see external link section).Sheikh Hasina, speech in Parliament on Golam Azam and the public tribunal, 16 April 1992, transcript in DOCUMENTS ON CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY COMMITTED BY PAKISTAN ARMY AND THEIR AGENTS IN BANGLADESH DURING 1971 137, (1999–2002) In September 1971, the Razakar force was placed under the command of Major General Mohammed Jamshed. Organisational command of the Razakar was given to Abdur Rahim. The Razakar force was organised into brigades of around 3000–4000 volunteers, mainly armed with light Infantry weapons provided by the Pakistani Army. Each Razakar Brigade was attached as an auxiliary to two Pakistani Regular Army Brigades, and their main function was to arrest and detain nationalist Bengali suspects. Suspects were tortured during custody and killed. The Razakars were trained by the Pakistan Army. While formed as a paramilitary group, the Razakars also served as local guides for the Pakistan army. Both organisations were later accused of having violated Geneva Conventions of War by raping, murdering and looting the locals. Razakars also allegedly killed Indian civilians during the war. On 5 August 1971, six Indians were killed by the Razakars in Panti village under Kumarkhali sub-division. They killed 3 Indians in Sylhet and 19 Indians in Jessore, Gopalganj and Chittagong hill tracts. Quoting a declassified US document Azadur Rahman Chandan wrote, \\"the 'Rasikars' are a destabilizing element – living off the land, able to make life and death decisions by denouncing collaborators and openly pillaging and terrorizing villagers without apparent restraint from the Army\\". The Razakars were paid by the Pakistan Army and Provincial Government. Leading supporters of a united Pakistan urged General Yahya Khan to increase the number of Razakars and given them more arms to extend their activities in East Pakistan. Towards the end of 1971, increasing numbers of Razakars were deserting, as the end of the war approached and Bangladesh moved towards independence.US Department of State, \\"Sitrep,\\" 5 October 1971, cited in R. Sisson and L. E. Rose. Pakistan, India, and the Creation of Bangladesh, University of California Press, 1990, p 308. Dissolution Following the surrender of the West Pakistan army on 16 December 1971 and the proclamation of independence of Bangladesh, the Razakar units were dissolved. The Jamaat party was banned, as it had opposed independence. Many leading Razakars fled to Pakistan (previously West Pakistan). Waves of violence followed the official end of the war, and some lower-ranking Razakars were killed in reprisals by Mukti Bahini militia. The government rounded up and imprisoned an estimated 36,000 men suspected of being Razakars. The government ultimately freed many of those held in jail, both in response to pressure from the United States and China, who backed Pakistan in the war, and to gain co-operation from Pakistan in obtaining the release of 200,000 Bengali-speaking military and civilian personnel who had been stranded or imprisoned in West Pakistan during the war.Dr. Mohammad Hannan, History of Liberation War of Bangladesh (বাংলাদেশের মুক্তিযুদ্ধের ইতিহাস- ড: মোহাম্মদ হান্নান) In Bangladesh today, razakar is used as a pejorative term meaning \\"traitor\\" or Judas.  Trials  In 2010 the Bangladesh government, led by the Awami League, set up an International Crimes Tribunal based on the International Crimes Tribunal Act 1973 to prosecute the people who committed war crimes and crimes against humanities during the liberation war in 1971. Several trials were concluded in early 2013: Abul Kalam Azad was convicted of eight charges and sentenced to death in January 2013. Abdul Quader Mollah was convicted of five of six charges and sentenced to death in December 2013. Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, the Nayeb-e-Ameer of Jamaat, was convicted of eight charges of war crimes and sentenced to death for two of them in February 2013. However, the trial process has been termed as \\"politically motivated\\" by its critics, while the human rights groups recognised the tribunal as falling short of international standards.

Notable confirmed Razakar members * AKM Yusuf, the lead organiser. * Forkan Mallik, a Razakar commander, convicted of rapes and forceful conversions in Mirzaganj, Patuakhali.

She made her first screen appearance as Phoebe during the episode broadcast on 23 September 1991. Phoebe is characterised as a studious individual which earns her the title of the \\"school swat\\". To secure the role Robertson put on a geeky persona during her audition. The character is also noted for her keen liking of reptiles, particularly her pet snake. The character is most often used in romantic stories with Todd Landers (Kristian Schmid) and Stephen Gottlieb (Lochie Daddo). She found love with Todd but producers decided to kill the character off following Schmid's departure and Phoebe was left grieving and pregnant with his child. She was later held hostage by Todd's father Bob Landers (Bruce Kilpatrick) and gives birth to a daughter named Hope. Phoebe would then begin a relationship with Stephen who would help her bring up Hope. He becomes paralysed and relies on Phoebe for support. She then became a victim to stalking from her obsessive housemate Russell Butler (Stephen Whittaker). Producers decided to write Phoebe out of Neighbours following Daddo's decision to leave, with him complaining that his character was written entirely around Phoebe. She departed the show during the episode broadcast on 15 September 1993. Casting Robertson was desperate to secure the role of Phoebe when she learned of the casting. She knew that the character was going to be a \\"bit freaky\\" and decided play herself up to the persona. She attended the audition wearing thick glasses and her hair in pigtails. Two days later Robertson was informed that she had won the part. Robertson decided to carry on with her school work and completed her final exams while filming. Robertson's father was also sceptical about her joining the cast because be believed it was not a viable career. Development Characterisation One of Phoebe's reptiles is a pet snake named Oscar. When Robertson auditioned for the role she was asked if she liked snakes. She pretended to like them to help gain the role. But she was later confronted with snake. She was required to have large snakes around her neck. Although the actual owner was onset in case of emergency. Off-screen the snake had to be replaced a number of times due to constant mishappenings. Robertson told Lisa Anthony from BIG! magazine that \\"we've had three different Oscars so far, the first one died, the second one got eaten by a snake - and that one died from indigestion!\\" Phoebe is characterised as strong willed and she does not conform to the social normal in society. Robertson told Martyn Palmer from What's on TV that \\"I like her desire to be herself. In real life you have to make compromises and pretend to be someone you're not - especially for the public. That's just not Phoebe's personality.\\" Robertson disliked Phoebe's quirky dress sense and style and dreaded what the wardrobe department would purchase for the character next. She added \\"she wears some awful clothes I wouldn't be seen dead in them outside work.\\" Through out her duration, writers made Phoebe prone to drama and used her for the show's main storylines. Robertson said that more happened to Phoebe in one week than people experience in a life time. She added \\"thank heavens my life's not so complicated.\\" Relationship with Todd Landers Phoebe begins a relationship with Todd Landers (Kristian Schmid) and the pairing developed Phoebe into one of Neighbours central characters. For Robertson the romance provided her with a challenge. She told an Inside Soap reporter that she was inexperienced and had never been in love. While creating the duo's scenes she had to use her imagination to make Phoebe appear \\"smitten by Todd\\". Schmid revealed that he had formed a close working relationship with Robertson through the storyline. He even had to correct inaccurate news stories they were romantically involved. In April 1992, a TV Week reporter announced that the couple would lose their virginity together. Todd then seventeen and Phoebe sixteen, the storyline was issue led and Schmid said that \\"Neighbours is a family show, but it’s also a realistic show.\\" Neighbours soon provided the actress with another challenging storyline. The character was sixteen years- old and discovers that she is pregnant with Todd's baby. The storyline was controversial and had much shock value for the residents of Ramsay Street. Robertson stated \\"when she gets pregnant, there are all sorts of problems she has to face.\\" She felt lucky that producers has given her such an \\"important role\\" and noted that \\"absolutely everything happens to this girl - there's never a dull moment in her life.\\" The pair have to decide whether or not to keep the baby. Schmid believed the couple should keep the baby and told Chris Twomey from What's on TV that Todd would make a good father because he is responsible. But Schmid had quit Neighbours and writers planned for Todd to leave Phoebe to live with his mother. He felt it was unrealistic and requested that his character be killed off. In the build up to his final scenes; Todd rushes to prevent Phoebe from having an abortion but is hit by a van and dies. Phoebe decides to keep the baby. Robertson told an Inside Soap reporter that \\"they decide to have an abortion, but they're both having second thoughts. Just as Phoebe is about to go under the knife, Jim calls the hospital to say that Todd has been run down, so Phoebe rushes to his bedside.\\" After seeing Todd lay in his hospital bed, Phoebe decides that she cannot have an abortion. Robertson believed that Todd's death scenes were the hardest to film. The atmosphere was so tense that they kept laughing in between takes. Todd returns soon after as a ghost to inform Phoebe that she will give birth to a girl. Todd's death leaves Phoebe struggling by herself. Robertson stated that she's mostly scared and really doesn't know what to do. She's got no family since her father died.\\" She began to share more screentime with Dorothy Burke (Maggie Dence) who decides to take Phoebe in and help out. Further characterisation was developed as Phoebe chooses to behave responsibly and remains focused on her education. She accepts that she must move on from Todd but still reminisces about their relationship during turmoil. In one of her most memorable moments, Todd's father Bob Landers (Bruce Kilpatrick) holds Phoebe hostage. He wields a gun at a shocked Phoebe, who did not expect to ever share an encounter with Bob. Relationship with Stephen Gottlieb The show cast Lochie Daddo as Phoebe's new love interest Stephen Gottlieb. Phoebe meets Stephen while she visits Todd's grave and he visits his dead lover, Libby's grave. He tracks her down to Ramsay Street where she attempts to put him off her by showing him her pet snake. Daddo told Shelli-Anne Couch from The Sydney Morning Herald that \\"It sort of turns into a little bit of a romance, starting very quickly\\". Robertson believed that Phoebe was really guilty about meeting Stephen. She explained that \\"[Phoebe] tells the new guy to keep away, but then she thinks that Todd would be happy for her and the baby.\\" Stephen becomes a \\"knight in shining armour\\" figure in Phoebe's life - always there to help her through the strain of her pregnancy. Daddo told Lisa Anthony from BIG! magazine that \\"his past opens his eyes to everything not being perfect and not lasting forever. He looks at things in a lighter way and that helps Phoebe.\\" Stephen had an unsettled childhood with hippy parents, so Phoebe and a baby really appeals to him. But Daddo thought that the storyline was unbelievable because \\"they meet, get married and have a baby in the space of about two months.\\" Hope Gottlieb The abortion issue proved controversial. Robertson told Hilary Kingsley from that \\"it was a very moral storyline, a difficult one for the scriptwriters to write.\\" Robertson believed that her generation were willing to talk about the issue. Following the scenes she received many letters from teenagers asking about abortion. She stated that she was pro-abortion and politics and law should not prevent it. In a storyline created from Todd's death Phoebe considers giving birth on Todd's grave. But she is met with opposition when fellow characters tell her it is a \\"ghoulish idea\\". Robertson did not enjoy filming pregnancy scenes. She told Kingsley that she dreaded going into the wardrobe department to have special padded clothing fitted. During the initial stages of pregnancy she was given a thick waist to wear. Later came a large bra followed by a \\"huge padded stomach and bum\\". Following the birth of Hope, Robertson struggled with scenes because she was not used to working with child actors. She also claimed that the storyline put her off having children of her own. Russell Butler Next Neighbours devised a \\"cuckoo in the nest\\" storyline for Phoebe and was created to disrupt her marriage. Following their wedding, Phoebe and Stephen begin to struggle financially. They reluctantly advertise for a lodger and Russell Butler (Stephen Whittaker) moves in. Despite being well mannered they soon witness odd behaviour from Russell. Phoebe is more nervous about his presence and becomes suspicious of him. Daddo told a reporter from Inside Soap that \\"he just seems to be able to do everything and something about the guy just doesn't add up.\\" This prompts Phoebe to search his room but is caught by Russel and he \\"completely freaks out\\" on her. The confrontation sees Stephen attempting to evict Russell, who he is reluctant to leave, forcing the Gottlieb's to \\"live in terror\\". They discover that Russell has been released from a mental institution following the death of his wife and daughter. Daddo explained that \\"he's after Phoebe and Hope as replacements for his own family.\\" The storyline then becomes more dramatic as Russell develops a \\"crush\\" on Phoebe. He then gets her alone, kisses her and Phoebe realises that she is in \\"serious trouble\\". Whittaker told Mary Fletcher of Woman's Own that \\"he wants to get rid of Stephen, endear himself to Phoebe and take over as Hope's dad.\\" So Russel is \\"quite shocked\\" when Phoebe does not respond to his advances. The actor believed that Russell had lost all sense of reality and following the shun becomes \\"threatening and manipulative\\" and \\"Phoebe is left not knowing what to do next\\". Russel's behaviour became a problem for Whittaker because fans began shouting, hitting him with umbrellas and warning him to leave Phoebe alone. An Inside Soap journalist later revealed that Russell would carry out a threat to steal hope. The incident leaves Phoebe with \\"nerves on red alert\\" and \\"struck dumb with fear\\". She is too scared of Russell to protect Hope and lets him snatch her. Stephen and Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver) decide to get revenge by paying a bike gang to attack Russell. However their plan fails and Wayne Duncan (Jonathan Sammy-Lee) is left for dead as they mistake his identity. Departure In August 1993, columnists from Shout and Inside Soap reported that both Robertson and Daddo were leaving their roles. Daddo's departure was influenced by disappointment of storylines. Chrissie Camp of TV Week reported that \\"industry sources\\" believed Daddo was \\"wasted\\" being paired with Robertson's heavily pregnant character. Daddo told Camp that he was unaware that his character would be entirely written around Phoebe. He added \\"his whole thing revolved around Phoebe and the baby - even now it's like that. They never gave him the chance to be on his own.\\" Robertson believed that any character she played following her departure was \\"bound to be a whole lot luckier than Phoebe\\". In May 1998, a writer from Inside Soap reported that the character had actually been axed from Neighbours. Storylines Phoebe appears at Erinsborough High School but her alternative personality makes her unpopular with fellow students. Josh Anderson (Jeremy Angerson) loses a bet with friends and is forced to ask Phoebe on a date. But she is upset to learn the truth and is forced to work with him on a school play. Josh then becomes attracted to her and they start dating. They are soon confronted with Phoebe's disapproving father, Arthur (Barry Hill). When Phoebe sternly defends their relationship Arthur suffers a heart-attack. She decides to be more open about her relationship and Arthur agrees to let them be together. But while Josh is away from Ramsay Street she develops feelings for Todd who reciprocates. Josh is angry by the betrayal but eventually forgives his friends. Arthur dies following a stroke and Phoebe's headmistress, Dorothy takes her in. Phoebe and Todd decide to consummate their relationship without using contraception and Phoebe becomes pregnant. She wants to have an abortion and Todd supports her decision, but when Phoebe goes to the abortion clinic, he changes his mind. He rushes to the clinic and is knocked down by a van. He is taken to hospital and Phoebe hears about his accident and does not have an abortion. Todd dies and later Phoebe has visions of him in which he tells her he will always be there for her and his daughter. When Phoebe visits Todd's grave, she meets Stephen. They form a bond and fall in love. Phoebe is surprised when Stephen proposes to her, but she accepts. Phoebe goes into labour and Stephen delivers the baby girl. Phoebe names her daughter, Hope (Laura Pearson). Stephen and Phoebe marry a few weeks later. Dorothy leaves Phoebe and Stephen to their new home and they decide to run the coffee shop. They take in a problematic lodger Russell. He tries to kiss Phoebe, harasses her and steals hope. Stephen uses a bike gang to scare Russell away from Ramsay Street. Stephen is paralysed in an explosion and the pair have to save their relationship. They then decide to open their own record store in Anson's Corner and leave Erinsborough. Stephen's brother Mark Gottlieb (Bruce Samazan) reveals that Phoebe and Stephen have five children upon his return to Erinsborough. Reception A writer for the BBC described Phoebe's most notable moment as \\"Being held hostage at number 30 by Bob Landers.\\" A columnist from Inside Soap wrote \\"Simone plays the freakiest girl in school, an oddball who doesn't worry about looks and fashion, has weird ideas and even keeps a snake as a pet. Romance is last on her list of priorities.\\" While their colleague stated \\"Neighbours teen lovers Todd and Phoebe thought that nothing could come between them.

She was wrecked in 1797 on Preservation Island off Tasmania while on her way from Calcutta to Port Jackson. She was among the first ships wrecked on the east coast of Australia.  Voyage  The ship was built in Calcutta as part of the rice fleet, under the name Begum Shaw. She arrived at Calcutta on 30 May 1796 from Coringa. This was shortly after the ship had arrived from Port Jackson and reported on conditions there. Sovereigns agents were the agency house (private trading firm) of Campbell and Clark. Campbell and Clark purchased Begum Shaw, renamed her Sydney Cove, retained her owner and master Gavin (or Guy) Hamilton as master, and provided her with a cargo that consisted of various provisions, spirits, and goods. The venture was speculative, meaning the goods had not been ordered by the colony, but rather were to be sold on arrival. Sydney Cove departed on 10 November 1796. She encountered heavy seas in December that started a leak. Further bad weather in January 1797 increased it, so that the pumps had to be manned continuously. In February, off the east coast of Tasmania, yet more heavy weather saw the leak gaining on the bailing efforts. On 9 February, with the water up to the lower-deck hatches, putting Sydney Cove in imminent danger of sinking, Hamilton decided to ground the stricken vessel on the island now called Preservation Island, which is in the Furneaux Group, north of Tasmania. He chose a sheltered location so everyone was able to get ashore safely and most of the cargo was saved, too. He had the salvaged rum stored safely out of the crew's reach, on nearby Rum Island.  Trek north  On 28 February 1797, leaving about 30 survivors with the wreckage, a party of seventeen men set off on in the ship's longboat to reach help at Port Jackson, away. This was led by first mate Hugh Thompson, and included William Clark (the supercargo), three European seamen, and twelve Indian lascars (sailors). Ill fortune struck again and they were wrecked on the mainland at the northern end of Ninety Mile Beach. Their only hope was to walk along the shore all the way to Sydney, a distance of over 600 kilometres. They had few provisions and no ammunition, and fatigue and hunger lessened their number as they marched. Along the way they encountered various aboriginal people, some friendly, some not. The last of the party to die on the march was killed by a man named Dilba and his people near Hat Hill. Those people had a reputation around Port Jackson for being ferocious. Matthew Flinders and George Bass had feared for their safety when they encountered Dilba the previous year. In May 1797, the three survivors of the march, William Clark, sailor John Bennet and one lascar had made it to the cove at Wattamolla and, on 15 May 1797, with their strength nearly at an end they were able to signal a boat out fishing, which took them on to Sydney. On the march, Clark had noted coal in the cliffs at what is now called Coalcliff between Sydney and Wollongong. This was the second instance of coal discovered in Australia.  Salvage  The schooner Francis and the sloop Eliza were dispatched to Preservation Island to collect the people remaining there and salvage the ship's cargo. While waiting for rescue, the survivors had lived on the local short-tailed shearwaters, also called Australian muttonbirds, and built rough shelter for themselves. But the ship was damaged in May by heavy westerly gales, making it impossible to save her. On the return journey Francis and Eliza became separated and Eliza was wrecked, with the loss of her crew and eight of the Sydney Cove survivors. Francis made a further salvage voyage in December and again in January 1798. Matthew Flinders was aboard the third voyage, assigned to make geographical observations. He noted petrels and seals, and located and named the Kent Group of islands. At the same time, George Bass was on his whaleboat voyage following the coast of the mainland, and he had thought to make for Sydney Cove to replenish his provisions but leaks in the boat prevented him setting that course. He did, however, encounter a group of escaped convicts marooned on an island. They, too, had been making for the ship with the false hope of refloating her and making good their escape.  Bass Strait  When the master of Sydney Cove reached Sydney, he reported that the strong south-westerly swell and the tides and currents suggested that the island was in a channel linking the Pacific and southern Indian Ocean. The Governor of New South Wales, John Hunter wrote to Joseph Banks in August 1797 that it seemed certain the strait existed. The salvage team also collected and preserved a wombat, which they forwarded to England for scientific observation, and observed colonies of seals. Soon after, seal hunters were active in the area.  Today  The wreck was relocated in 1977, lying partly covered by sand in about 3 to 6 metres of water. Excavations have been made to recover artifacts and some timbers. The Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery in Launceston has a display of items from the ship, including the world's oldest bottle of beer.Washington Post, 15 November 2016 The survivors' camp was excavated in 2002. In 2016, new Saccharomyces and Brettanomyces strains of yeast genetically similar to those used in Trappist Ale were isolated from one of the 26 beer bottles recovered from the wreck 20 years earlier. In August 2018 James Squire released a limited number of bottles of \\"Preservation Ale\\", made from this yeast. In 1997, a re-enactment of the epic journey was completed by members of Scouts NSW and the community. The re-enactment, called The Long Long Walk, was arranged by Warren Goodall of Oak Flats, who used the diary of the survivors to help with planning the walk. Artefacts from the ship wreck were used as a baton and passed from one walking team to another throughout the trip. Descendants of the ship's captain, Guy Hamilton, were met by Mr Goodall at Wattamolla who presented them with the artefacts which in turn were handed to the Rookwood Cemetery Museum.

They resisted the integration of Hyderabad State into the Dominion of India. They also had plans to make the Nizam accede his princely state to Pakistan instead of India.Moraes, Frank, Jawaharlal Nehru, Mumbai: Jaico. 2007, p.394 Eventually, the Indian Army routed the Razakars during Operation Polo. Qasim Razvi was initially jailed and then allowed to move to Pakistan where he was granted asylum, on an undertaking that he would migrate to Pakistan within forty-eight hours of his release. History & War crimes Qasim Razvi, the leader of Razakars Razakars during Operation Polo The Hyderabad State was a kingdom that was ruled by the Nizam. When India became independent in 1947, like all the other Princely states, the Hyderabad State was also given the choice of either joining India or Pakistan. The Nizam wanted neither he wanted to remain independent. The Nizam finally entered into a standstill agreement with India on 29 November 1947 to maintain the status quo. Hyderabad state had been steadily becoming more theocratic since the beginning of the 20th century. In 1926, Mahmud Nawaz Khan, a retired Hyderabad official, founded the Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (also known as MIM). The MIM became a powerful organization, with the principal focus to marginalize the political aspirations of moderate Muslims. MIM \\"had its storm troopers in the Razakars who were headed by Kasim Razvi, a Muslim educated at Aligarh University who claimed Hyderabad was a Muslim state and that Muslim supremacy was based upon the right of conquest\\".Moraes, Frank, Jawaharlal Nehru, Mumbai: Jaico. 2007, p.390 The Razakars demanded special powers from the Nizam, which they started to misuse and the Nizam had to abide by their dictates. The Nizam sent a delegation to the United Nations to refer the Hyderabad State case to the UN Security Council. Islamist leader Qasim Rizvi and the Razakars had the additional agenda to persuade the Nizam to accede to Pakistan, instead of remaining independent of both India and Pakistan. The Razakar militia brutally put down the armed revolts by Communist sympathizers and the peasantry and even eliminated activist Muslims such as journalist Shoebullah Khan who advocated merger with India.Rao, P.R., History and Culture of Andhra Pradesh: From the Earliest Times to 1991, New Delhi: Sterling Publishers, 2012. p. 284Remembering a legend, The Hindu, 22 August 2008; Aniket Alam, A one-man crusade, it was and still is, The Hindu, 6 January 2003. The Razakars terrorised the Hindu population and its sympathizers, causing many to flee to safety into the jungles, uninhabited mud forts, or neighboring Indian provinces. The Hyderabad State Congress was banned and its leaders forced to flee to Bezawada or Bombay. The Communist Party of India also became active in attempting to defend the general population from the Razakar militia. It was during this time the Razakars launched a series of attacks on Hindu areas in which they killed livestock, looted, raped women and children, and mutilated and massacred able-bodied persons. The sheer massive extent of the genocide affecting the wide expanse of rural Telangana is not known as the Nizam regime attempted to cover up records of it happening and prevent information from spreading to external media. Annexation after Operation Polo Finally, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the Indian Minister for Home Affairs, decided to undertake \\"police action\\" in Hyderabad State to force the King Nizam's hand.Operation Polo was launched and the Indian Army, led by Major General J. N. Chaudhuri, entered the state from five directions. The Razakars fought briefly against the overwhelming attack by Indian forces before surrendering on 18 September 1948. Mir Laik Ali, the Prime Minister of the Nizam, and Qasim Rizvi were arrested. On 22 September 1948, the Nizam withdrew his complaint from the UN Security Council. The merger of Hyderabad into the Indian Union was announced. Major General Chaudhuri took over as military governor of Hyderabad and stayed in that position till the end of 1949. In January 1950, M. K. Vellodi, a senior civil servant was made the Chief Minister of the state and the Nizam was given the position of \\"Raj Pramukh\\" or \\"Governor\\". The Pandit Sunderlal Committee Report estimated that between 27,000 and 40,000 people lost their lives in the violence that ensued the operation. Disbanded The Razakars were disbanded after the merger of Hyderabad with India and the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen was banned—though it was rechartered under the Congress government as All India MIM (AIMIM) in 1957.

The Sega Saturn version was released in early 1997. Gameplay The fighting action takes place on a round, elevated platform. Each fighter begins the fight with a full power meter and one power meter refill in reserve that is activated when the primary meter is depleted. Thus, there are no rounds. The fight runs until one fighter is knocked out (no more power in their meter), one is knocked out of the arena (or steps/jumps out), or the time runs out. As the game progresses, the player gains access to two additional \\"levels\\" for the character, which unlocks new moves and gives the character a new appearance. Plot Two alien races, the Nezom and Zerai clans obtained a powerful crystalline stone called \\"The Relic,\\" and anointed themselves \\"The Chosen Ones.\\" The Chosen Ones used this power to subjugate the other races, exterminating those that failed to comply. After this era of war, The Chosen Ones began to enjoy a new age of peace. However, The Relic was stolen and The Chosen Ones' power was shaken. Now, warriors from all over the universe seek the relic, each with their own ambitions. Development Criticom initially had a comic book character license and Sony Computer Entertainment as its publisher. As the game neared the end of the design phase, Sony took the license from Kronos Digital Entertainment and give it to one of their European subsidiaries. Rather than completely abandon their design work, Kronos opted to create new characters and shop the game concept to other publishers. Kronos president Stan Liu recounted: Reception The first news and screenshots of the game sparked an enthusiastic reaction from VideoGames, which called it \\"one of the coolest fighting game experiences in a long time\\".Video Games Issue 81 (October 1995), page 56 However, it went on to receive mostly negative reviews, as critics found the strong character designs and graphics to be outweighed by the poor animation and gameplay. Reviewing the PlayStation version in GamePro, Scary Larry praised the game's interesting characters, \\"gorgeous\\" backgrounds, and sound effects. However, he felt the sluggish moves, particularly the throws, give the game less impact and make it more of a holdover until the next installment of Virtua Fighter or Toshinden. A reviewer for Next Generation said the game has impressive graphics, making particular note of the realistic lighting and shadow effects, but looks poor in motion due to the animation being done \\"by hand\\", without motion capture. While he found the character designs to be consistently \\"clever and imaginative\\", he deemed the game an overall failure due to the way the choppy frame rate interferes with the gameplay. Rich Leadbetter of Maximum remarked that the game has excellent graphics but poor animation and unexciting moves, and compared it unfavorably to Zero Divide and Tekken 2. PlayStation Magazine called it \\"a challenging combat game that only reveals its depth with time\\".PSM 12 GamePro named the Saturn version the worst fighting game of the year, stating that compared to the PlayStation version of the previous season, it has \\"even slower gameplay, choppy, simple graphics, and no chance at being any fun.\\" According to Kronos president Stan Liu, the game was a commercial success, partly because it had been completed on budget and on time, and partly because it sold in respectable numbers, which he attributed chiefly to it being a fairly early PlayStation game. Sequels The game spawned two semi-sequels, Dark Rift and Cardinal Syn.

He presented candidates, and when she found fault with them, concluded she did not want to marry at all. Cannetella said she would marry a man with golden hair and golden teeth. Fioravante, a mortal enemy of the king's and a magician, turned himself into a man with golden hair and golden teeth. The king agreed to their marriage, but Fioravante insisted on carrying off the princess with no attendants or baggage.

He bribed an old woman to let him see the princess, and Cannetella saw him. She had her father build her a chamber with seven iron doors. Fioravante went back to the old woman and had her go to the castle, selling rouge, and slip a piece of paper in the princess's bed, to charm everyone else asleep. Everyone fell asleep.

He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 12 October 1992. Casting On 11 October 1992, Shelli-Anne Couch from The Sydney Morning Herald revealed that Daddo had joined the cast of Neighbours as Stephen Gottlieb, \\"a record store manager with an enormous amount of compassion.\\" Daddo was initially signed until December, with an option to extend his contract for another six months. Of his casting, Daddo stated \\"It's something new for me. I'm just starting out on the acting side of things and I don't think there is a better place to learn. Like everyone says, I'd love to go from here and make films. But I'm not sure. I want to stay in the acting side and just see where it takes me. I really don't know what will happen, where I'll be. I'm just enjoying what I'm doing now.\\" The actor made his first appearance as Stephen during the episode broadcast on 12 October 1992. Development Marriage to Phoebe Bright While he was at the graveyard visiting his dead fiancée, Stephen noticed a pregnant Phoebe Bright (Simone Robertson) by the graveside of her ex-boyfriend, Todd (Kristian Schmid). They confided in each other and Stephen made Phoebe realise that Todd's spirit would be with her where ever she goes, after learning that she wanted to have her baby by his grave. Daddo commented that their meeting \\"sort of turns into a little bit of a romance.\\" Stephen later visits Phoebe and she tries to put him off by showing him her pet snake, Oscar, but he states that he has one of his own. Couch revealed that Daddo did his own research for the snake scenes by visiting an animal farm outside Melbourne. Of Phoebe's reaction to meeting Stephen, Robertson explained \\"It's a really weird way to meet the man of your dreams, but at least something is about to go right for Phoebe. The main thing for me is that I really get on well with Lochie. As for Stephen, he works in a record shop and is so different from Todd. He's older – 23 – and calmer.\\" After five weeks of dating, Stephen proposed to Phoebe. Robertson thought the proposal was too fast, especially as Phoebe was not interested in Stephen at first and was still hung up on Todd. While Phoebe accepted the proposal, Robertson believed that she was not in love with Stephen. She told an Inside Soap writer \\"She was definitely falling for him, but I don't think she really ever loved. Phoebe had a lot of respect for him because he persevered with her for so long! And I think because he was older she saw him as a bit of a father figure, and as her father had died I guess that was quite appealing.\\" After succumbing to Stephen's \\"easy charm\\", Phoebe planned an early wedding. While Stephen was out on his stag night, Phoebe went into labour two months early. Stephen rushed back to their house and helped deliver Phoebe's daughter, Hope (Laura Pearson). Hope developed breathing problems and it was left to Stephen to break the news to Phoebe that she might die. Stephen became worried that if Hope died, Phoebe would not want to marry him and his feelings of unease grew when everyone began talking about Todd. However, Hope pulled through and Phoebe and Stephen were married in a small ceremony in one of the Ramsay Street gardens. Russell Butler When Phoebe and Stephen suffered financial difficulties, they decided to take in lodger Russell Butler (Steven Whittaker). Daddo claimed that Stephen was initially \\"really cool\\" with Russell living with him, but then he started to get under his skin and \\"a whole new side\\" of Stephen emerged. Phoebe had a similar reaction and she was also nervous around Russell. Daddo said \\"He just seems to be able to do anything and the guy just doesn't add up.\\" Phoebe became suspicious of Russell and decided to look around his room, but when Russell caught her he freaked out. At that point, Stephen wanted Russell to leave, but he was difficult to get rid of and the Gottliebs lived in fear of what he would do next. It eventually emerged that Russell had been released from an institution after he lost his wife and daughter. Daddo explained that Russell saw Phoebe and Hope as substitutions for his own family. Stephen formed a plan to get rid of Russell with Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver). They paid a gang of bikers to attack Russell, but their plan went wrong when Wayne Duncan (Jonathan Sammy-Lee) was attacked and left for dead by mistake. Paralysis Stephen was paralysed when The Waterhole exploded due to a gas leak in the basement.Monroe 1996, p.118. During filming of the explosion, Daddo revealed that he was made up to look as if his forehead had caved in. Stephen lost all movement down one side of his body and was told that he would be confined to a wheelchair. Daddo told Women's Own writer Mary Fletcher that the storyline made him relive his own brother's accident, which left him wheelchair bound. Of Stephen's reaction to his condition, Daddo stated \\"When Stephen discovers he'll be in a wheelchair, he tries to spare Phoebe by ending it with her, saying he doesn't love her. But what he means is he loves her too much to burden her with a lifetime of looking after him.\\" Phoebe managed to convince Stephen that they belonged together and he because he loved her, they stayed together. Following rehabilitation, Stephen managed to regain the use of his legs. He eventually managed to walk without his wheelchair and made a full recovery. When the insurance money from the accident came through, Stephen decided that he wanted to use it open his own record store. Daddo revealed that Stephen being blown up in The Waterhole was his favourite storyline from his time on Neighbours. Departure In July 1993, Chrissie Camp from TV Week reported that Daddo had decided to quit Neighbours, after twelve months of playing Stephen. Camp revealed that Daddo would film his final scenes on 6 August, while his character would remain on-screen until October. Daddo stated that the decision was mutual between himself and producers, saying \\"They didn't know what to do with Stephen next and I thought a year in Neighbours was long enough for me.\\" The actor told Camp that he had not expected to be given a character who, after only six weeks, was married with a child. He believed the development did not allow him any time to establish Stephen as a character on his own and he became frustrated. Daddo said \\"His whole thing revolved around Phoebe and the baby. Everything he did - even now, its like that. They never gave him a chance to be on his own.\\" Stephen's exit storyline saw him and Phoebe leave Erinsborough to run a record shop in Anson's Corner. Storylines Stephen was the eldest of three children born to Dave Gottlieb (David Murray; Ivar Kants) and Sally Dawes (Jane Little; Helen Rollinson) on a hippy commune. He was christened Freedom, but as they grew up, Stephen and his brother Mark (Bruce Samazan) rejected their parents' ways, while their younger sister, Serendipity (Raelee Hill) embraced them. When Stephen became the manager of a record store in Elliot Park, he proposed to long-time girlfriend, Libby and she accepted. One night at a party, Mark spiked Stephen's drink, leaving him unable to drive Libby home. Mark, also ended up too drunk to drive Libby himself, forcing her to take a cab. Libby died when the cab crashed and Stephen blamed Mark for her death. After Mark left for France to train as a chef, Stephen finally felt he could move on with his life. Stephen first appears at the cemetery where he sees pregnant teenager Phoebe visiting the grave of her recently deceased lover, Todd Landers. The two begin to chat and they realize they have a lot in common as Stephen's fiancé, Libby had not long died in a car crash and is buried in the same cemetery as Todd. After spending a lot of time with Phoebe, Stephen begins to fall for her but he realises that she is still grieving for Todd. After several months of dating, Stephen propose to Phoebe on her 18th birthday and she accepts. The couple plan to marry before the baby is born, but on the eve of the wedding Phoebe goes into labour and Stephen delivers the baby girl in the living room at Number 30. Phoebe names her daughter Hope, after she is born prematurely. When Phoebe wants to put Todd's surname, Landers on Hope's birth certificate, Stephen feels like Todd would always haunt them. After Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy), Todd's surrogate grandmother, explains that Todd would have been happy with Phoebe's choice of husband, Stephen is reassured. On the day of Stephen and Phoebe's wedding, local nurse Pam Willis (Sue Jones) brings them a healthy Hope in time for the ceremony. After Stephen loses his job at the record store after refusing to take bribes from record companies to falsify record sales, he and Phoebe are given a lifeline by Cathy Alessi (Elspeth Ballantyne) who puts them in charge of the Coffee Shop. They job share and take it in turns to look after Hope. When the Gottliebs advertise for a tenant, Russell Butler spots the notice and takes it down so no one else will apply for the room. On the surface, Russell seems normal but as time goes on Stephen and Phoebe soon find out that Russell's behaviour is odd and he begins to drive a wedge between the couple by stirring up trouble. When Russell tries to kiss Phoebe one afternoon, she tells Stephen who demands Russell moves out. However, this is problematic as Russell intends to stay until the lease expires. After Stephen lashes out and punches Russell, he has him charged with assault and then pays Stephen rent at the last minute to avoid eviction. It is revealed that Russell had spent time in a mental institution after suffering a break down following his wife and baby leaving him, due to his drug use. Fearful for his family's safety, Stephen sends Phoebe and Hope to stay with Phoebe's former guardian Dorothy Burke (Maggie Dence) in the country for several days. In desperation, Stephen then asks Lou Carpenter to have some heavies \\"persuade\\" Russell to leave. Unfortunately the plan backfires and Wayne Duncan is mistaken for Russell and badly beaten instead. Stephen and Lou apologise to Wayne, and Russell gets the message that he is not welcome in Ramsay Street. The Gottliebs have better luck with Beth Brennan (Natalie Imbruglia) as their next tenant as she is a friend. When the local pub, The Waterhole explodes, Stephen is one of the casualties and is the first to be found in the wreckage. He wakes up in hospital and is disoriented and has no memory of Phoebe, who was keeping a bedside vigil. Stephen then has an operation to remove a blood clot on his brain and recovers and regains his memory. He is left paralysed and soon feels like a burden to Phoebe and decides to go to a rehabilitation centre but changes his mind at the last minute. Stephen struggles to come to terms with being in a wheelchair and when his estranged brother, Mark arrives in Erisborough, he is less than happy to see him as he still blames him for Libby's death. After Mark's persistence to reconcile with his brother, Stephen finally accepts him. Stephen then undergoes a gruelling rehabilitation programme. During Helen's birthday party at the newly reopened Waterhole, Stephen surprises Phoebe by getting up out of his wheelchair and walks towards her unaided. Stephen reveals that Wayne has been helping him for weeks. Several days later, the Gottliebs leave Ramsay Street to manage their own record store in Anson's Corner. Upon Mark's return to Erinsborough twenty-five years later, he reveals that Phoebe and Stephen have five children. Reception A writer for the BBC's Neighbours website stated that Stephen's most notable moment was \\"Fainting while watching Phoebe giving birth on video.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald's Shelli-Anne Couch commented \\"Two snakes, two dead bodies, two live ones, a cemetery and a budding romance for good measure – could Lachlan Daddo have picked a better entry into the soapie world?\\" Some industry sources believed Stephen was \\"wasted\\" when he was paired with Phoebe, who was seventeen and six months pregnant when they met. During a feature on the show, Joanna Murray-Smith from The Age criticised the explosion storyline, saying \\"Sure Lochie (Daddo, from the Beaumaris-y version of the Quaid brothers) was crippled, so it wasn't a complete waste of time, but it was over in a flash with a couple of extras in emergency service uniforms.\\" References * External links *Character profile at BBC Online *Character profile at the Internet Movie Database Neighbours characters Television characters introduced in 1992 Male characters in television ","title":"Stephen Gottlieb"},{"id":"5790911","text":"The Hultman–Chapman murder case (formally People of the Philippines vs. Claudio Teehankee Jr.) was a murder case that gained wide publicity in the Philippines during the early 1990s because Claudio Teehankee Jr., the perpetrator of the crime, was the son of the late former Chief Justice Claudio Teehankee and the brother of former Justice Undersecretary Manuel Teehankee. The case helped sway the public view and lawmakers on crime and restore the death penalty in the Philippines. Crime and arrest Court records show that Roland John Chapman, Maureen Hultman, and another friend, Jussi Olavi Leino, were coming home from a party at around three o'clock in the morning of 13 July 1991. Leino was walking Hultman home along Mahogany street in Dasmariñas Village, Makati City when Teehankee came up behind them in his car. He stopped the two and demanded that they show some identification. Leino took out his wallet and showed Teehankee his Asian Development Bank ID. Teehankee grabbed the wallet. Chapman, who was waiting in a car for Leino, stepped in and asked Teehankee: \\"Why are you bothering us?\\" Teehankee drew out his gun and shot Chapman in the chest, killing him instantly. After a few minutes, Teehankee shot Leino, hitting him in the jaw. Then he shot Hultman on the temple before driving away. Leino survived and Hultman died two months later in hospital due to brain hemorrhages caused by the bullet fragments. Teehankee was arrested several days later on the testimony of several witnesses. The witnesses were Domingo Florence and Agripino Cadenas, private security guards, and Vincent Mangubat, a driver, all three being employs of residents of the village.

R. Nos. 111206-08, October 6, 1995, Reynato Puno Restoration of death penalty The killings of Chapman and Hultman, together with other notable heinous crimes such as the murder of Eldon Maguan and the Vizconde massacre caused the Philippine Congress to restore the death penalty in the Philippines in 1993. The imposition of the death penalty had been suspended with the enactment of the 1987 Philippine Constitution. The death penalty would again be barred in the Philippines after legislation to that effect was passed in 2006. Imprisonment \\"Bobbins\\" or Claudio Jr. started serving the sentence on 24 June 1991, by virtue of his preventive detention at the Makati City jail, and then, at New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa since 16 January 1993. On the civil aspect, the trial Court approved the 19 November 1999 settlement signed by the Hultman family and the Teehankees, on 10 January 2000. The lower court issued entry of judgment on 17 February 2000, and on 13 January 2003, the Hultmans filed the Notice of Satisfaction of Judgment. Accordingly, Bobbins filed the petition for executive clemency on 22 December 2003, since he already served a total of 13 years and 5 months of actual time, equivalent to 15 years under the Good Conduct Credits rules and guidelines. Formal notices of the application were published in the newspapers, inter alia, to all parties concerned, on 28 January and 6 February 2004 with no oppositions filed. By virtue of the Presidential Order of Commutation dated 30 September 2008, Bobbins is just one of 1,430 released who were similarly situated. Thus, on 3 October 2008, based on actual time served of 17 years, 2 months and 9 days, equivalent to legal 21 years, 5 months and 3 days, Bobbins was freed.[Philippine Daily Inquirer, 14 October 2008, page A8, \\"SETTING THE RECORDS STRAIGHT]gmanews.tv, Shadowy group defends Teehankee release in newspaper ads Vivian and Anders Hultman belatedly protested the release in media. newsinfo.inquirer.net, Hypocrites, Gonzalez calls Hultmans Presidential clemency On 6 October 2008, Raul M.

The personnel on the session, produced by Hatch, included guitarist Big Jim Sullivan. Described by Clark herself as \\"an anti-protest song\\", \\"Round Every Corner\\" employs the musical structure of a children's singing game to present its message of optimism. Clark recorded versions of \\"Round Every Corner\\" in French: \\"Va Toujours Plus Loin\\" (\\"Always go farther\\") and Italian: \\"Gocce di mare\\" (\\"Drops in the ocean\\"). Although Clark had been recording successfully in German regularly since 1962, no German version of \\"Round Every Corner\\" was recorded by herself. Instead, Israeli singer and actress Carmela Corren recorded the song in German as \\"Heut' oder morgen\\" (\\"Today Or Tomorrow\\"). The previous Petula Clark single \\"You'd Better Come Home\\" had evinced a sharp decline in the chart fortunes established by her breakout hit \\"Downtown\\". \\"Round Every Corner\\" would virtually duplicate the precedent single's chart placings in both the US, where \\"You'd Better Come Home\\" and \\"Round Every Corner\\" respectively peaked at #22 and #21, and in the UK. The UK fall-off was more severe - the respective peaks being #44 and #43 - suggesting a brief presence for Clark at the forefront of the 1960s Britpop scene, particularly as the follow-up to \\"Downtown\\": \\"I Know a Place\\", had - despite reaching #3 US - only been a moderate UK hit (#17). Clark's next UK single \\"You're the One\\" would boost her UK chart profile considerably with a #23 peak but it would be the subsequent \\"My Love\\" - ironically a record the singer disliked - which would consolidate the stardom augured for Clark by \\"Downtown\\".

At the time of his death in 1936, he had developed a \\"city of charity\\" under the patronage of Our Lady of Victory in Lackawanna, New York. It consisted of a minor basilica, an infant home, a home for unwed mothers, a boys' orphanage, a boys' protectory, a hospital, a nurses' home, and a grade and high school. Since 1986, the Our Lady of Victory parish and the Diocese of Buffalo have been working to secure Father Baker's canonization. He has been designated \\"Venerable\\" by the Roman Catholic Church. History Early life and military service Nelson Baker was born in Buffalo, New York, on February 16, 1842, to Lewis Becker (later Baker) and Caroline Donnellan, parents who were ethnic German and Irish, during a period when the rate of immigration was increasing from Europe. He was the second eldest of four sons. His father, a German Evangelical Lutheran, was a retired mariner. Lewis had opened a grocery and general goods store on Batavia Street (now called Broadway) in Buffalo. He is said to have instilled an astute business sense in young Nelson, who worked in the store after graduating from high school in 1858. Nelson's mother Caroline was a devout Irish Catholic, and the children were all baptized and raised as Catholic. Nelson was baptized a Roman Catholic in 1851, aged 9. During the Civil War, Baker enlisted at age 21 as a Union soldier in early July 1863 as part of the 74th regiment of the New York State Militia. His regiment, which saw duty along the Pennsylvania front at the Battle of Gettysburg, was used to help quell the New York City draft riots in 1863. Crowds of largely ethnic Irish rioted in protest of the draft; in their resentment they attacked African Americans, and their homes and businesses. Both groups competed in low-paying jobs. Post-Civil War After returning home from the war, Baker started a successful feed and grain business with his friend, Joseph Meyer, another veteran. He demonstrated a strong interest in religious matters and joined the St. Vincent DePaul Society. He began taking Latin classes at St. Michael's residence in Buffalo, which would become Canisius College in 1870.Kern, Walter. \\"The Life and Times of Father Baker\\", Western New York Catholic, December 1989 Following a spiritual calling Nelson Baker during his tenure as rector of St. Patrick's In the summer of 1869 Baker took a steamer trip along the Lake Erie shoreline, using this time to sort out his life. By the time he returned to Buffalo, he had decided to enter the priesthood. His mother was delighted with the news; however, his father, brother, and former business partner Meyer were not sure. Nelson Baker entered Our Lady of Angels Seminary (now Niagara University) on September 2, 1869. He was hospitalized for eighteen weeks when taken ill with erysipelas, known in the Middle Ages as \\"St. Anthony's Fire.\\" During his studies at the seminary, Baker was part of a group of 108 that went on a pilgrimage to Rome in 1874 to support the restoration of the Papal States. On this pilgrimage, the group stopped in Paris, France, and toured the Our Lady of Victories Sanctuary. Several biographers of Baker note that this visit to the Marian shrine in France was the start of his lifelong devotion to Our Lady of Victory.Thomas Galvin, A Modern Apostle of Charity: Father Baker and his \\"Lady of Victory Charities\\" (Buffalo: The Buffalo Catholic Publication Co., 1925), 21; Floyd Anderson Father Baker (Buffalo, 1960), 51 In Rome the group briefly met Pope Pius IX at the Vatican. Baker was ordained on March 19, 1876, by Bishop Stephen V. Ryan at St. Joseph's Cathedral in Buffalo, New York. He returned to Our Lady of the Angels the next day, to celebrate his first Mass. His first assignment was as an assistant to Father Thomas Hines at Limestone Hill, New York (now known as Lackawanna, New York). The parish there consisted of St. Patrick's church, St. Joseph's Orphanage, and St. John's Protectory. Father Baker would stay at this assignment until 1881 when he was transferred to St. Mary's Parish in Corning to assist the Reverend Peter Colgan. In 1882, Father Baker was transferred back to Limestone Hill as Superintendent. \\"Padre of the Poor\\" Our Lady of Victory Basilica A few days after Father Baker returned to Limestone Hill, a group of creditors informed the priest that the three parish institutions had amassed a sizeable debt, and they demanded immediate payment. He assured them that they would be repaid, citing his past dealings as a businessman. Using his remaining personal savings, he repaid part of the debt and entered into verbal agreements to repay the balance. During this time, Father Baker developed the concept of \\"The Association of Our Lady of Victory\\". He took the step of writing to postmasters in towns across the country and requesting the names and addresses of the Catholic women in their area. He wrote to these women, asking for their help in caring for the children at the orphanage and protectory. They could join the \\"Association of Our Lady of Victory\\" for a donation of $.25 (25 cents) a year. Baker started a journal, The Annals of the Association of Our Lady of Victory, in 1888 to be sent to Association members and to solicit help for the orphanage and protectory. The Annals was published until 1929, when it was absorbed by The Victorian Magazine. This publication was produced by the Homes which Baker headed, and it was published between 1895 and the early 1970s.Heather A. Hartel, Producing Father Nelson H. Baker: The Practices of Making a Saint for Buffalo, NY, doctoral dissertation, University of Iowa, 2006 Baker's approach to raising money worked, and the creditors were paid in full by June 1889. Father Baker also worked to ensure his parish did not go into debt again. In 1891, a natural gas well was discovered on the land of the Our Lady of Victory Homes, which helped to offset heating costs. Local traditional stories claim that the discovery of this gas well was a miracle. By 1901, the number of boys at St. John's Protectory tripled to 385, and in St. Joseph's Orphanage, the total number of children doubled to 236. The city was attracting thousands of immigrants to work in new industries, and some were families in need. Baker was named Vicar General of the Buffalo Diocese in 1904. Rome commended his religious leadership in 1923 by naming him Protonotary Apostolic ad instar Participantium, an honor accorded to only five other clergymen in the United States at that time. Veneration In 1987, Baker was named Servant of God.Villarrubia, Eleonore. \\"The Servant of God, Father Nelson Baker\\", Catholicism.org, January 31, 2006 His remains were moved from the Holy Cross Cemetery in 1999 and reinterred under the Our Lady of Lourdes altar in the Our Lady of Victory Basilica and National Shrine. On 14 January 2011, Pope Benedict XVI authorized the Congregation for the Causes of Saints to promulgate a decree recognizing Fr. Baker's \\"heroic virtue,\\" and designating him Venerable. Reception The sarcophagus containing the remains of Father Nelson Baker. Honored in his home community as \\"Buffalo's most influential citizen of the 20th century,\\" Baker was honored by a major bridge on New York State Route 5 being named for him. Baker remains a favorite local figure in the Buffalo area because of his history of charity, and the community hopes that he will eventually be canonized.

On 21 June 2002, Chowdhury's father resigned from the presidency after facing the possibility of impeachment and removal from office by the BNP-led parliament. Subsequently, Chowdhury resigned from BNP on 10 March 2004 and joined the Bikalpa Dhara Bangladesh (BDB) – a political party founded by his father.

Joe: A Real American Hero series of toys, animated series and comics. He was originally created as a character for the Sunbow/Marvel animated series in 1984, and later produced as an action figure, and finally introduced into the comic book in 1985. Profile His real name is Hector X. Delgado, and he was born in Chula Vista, California. Shipwreck grew up near the San Diego Navy Yards and enlisted in the Navy at sixteen after getting permission from his parents. In the two-part Sunbow episode \\"There's No Place Like Springfield,\\" he revealed he lied about being the minimum age of seventeen in order to join. Shipwreck graduated from the Great Lakes Naval Gunnery School, and is a qualified expert with the M-14, M-16, Browning .50 cal., 20mm Oerlikon AA gun, and the M1911A1 Auto Pistol. He served time at Gitmo before moving on to carrier operations in the Middle East, and participating in patrolling actions in the Mekong Delta and Yokosuka. Shipwreck dislikes the use of \\"gadgets\\" in war. \\"See the target, shoot the target\\" is his philosophy.G.I. Joe #9 (October 2013) It has been speculated that his appearance was based on that of George Harrison, although his voice in the cartoon and the fact that he is a naval seaman indicates that he is based on Jack Nicholson's character from the film The Last Detail. He has a pet parrot named Polly (voiced by Frank Welker & Neil Ross), who is his loyal companion and is usually seen sitting on his shoulder or helping out with the G.I Joe team on some of their missions; in the series Polly would often repeat commands, as well as nautical terms. On rare occasions, he even proved capable of holding brief but meaningful conversations with human beings (as when, in one episode, he initially refused to divulge Shipwreck's whereabouts to the other Joes), indicating far greater intelligence than a typical parrot. Polly also learned sailing songs from Shipwreck and was prone to including Shipwreck's name in them, to the latter's embarrassment; Polly customarily addresses Shipwreck simply as \\"Sailor.\\" Because of Polly's irritating behavior, Shipwreck would sometimes leave him back home while away on missions; in a dream sequence Polly dreams about being the leader of the P.E.T.S. (Primal Emergency Tactical Squad), which is a sub-team of G.I. Joe composed of all the Joe's pets. In the dream, they save Shipwreck from Crystal Ball. Action figures Shipwreck first appeared in the 1985 edition of the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero toy series as the G.I. Joe sailor, with his parrot, Polly. In 1994, he was repackaged as a Navy SEAL and received an action figure update. He also had a 12\\" edition figure produced as part of the G.I. Joe vs. Cobra line. Though Shipwreck did not appear in the G.I. Joe: Sigma Six TV series, a figure in his likeness was released under the name. Comics Marvel Comics Shipwreck's first appearance was in issue #40 (October 1985) of Marvel Comics' G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero series, alongside Barbecue. This concerns the testing of a mobile weapons platform.G.I. Joe #40 He then helps the Joes deal with the aquatic effects of the creation of Cobra Island, namely a tidal wave. The Joes make a preemptive attack on the island but are ordered off before anything definite happens.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #41 (November 1985) During the Joes' nighttime invasion of the Cobra-controlled town of Springfield, Shipwreck is part of Hawk's strike team, which is sent to take control of the airport.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #49 (July 1986) When Cobra's subsequent attempt to retake the airport turns out to be a feint, Shipwreck fires a white phosphoorus shell skyward to reveal Cobra transport helicopters have already evacuated the town, leaving the Joes virtually empty-handed.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #50 (August 1986) In issue #51, he and Alpine are part of a squad sent out to stop Zartan's escape attempt. The two team up to stop a Dreadnok \\"Swamp-Copter\\"; Alpine launches a hooked rope at it and Shipwreck ties it to a nearby tank. This works, gaining them temporary custody of Zarana and her brother Zandar. A spray of gunfire from the Thunder Machine sends Shipwreck diving for his life and the prisoners escape.G.I. Joe #51 Shipwreck has a cameo in the fourth issue of the G.I. Joe Yearbook series as part of a Joe team spying on Cobra Island. This involves a confrontation with the Oktober Guard.\\"G.I. Joe Yearbook\\" #4 (1988) During the Cobra Civil War, Shipwreck is teamed with Cutter and pilots a W.H.A.L.E. hovercraft.\\"G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero\\" #75 He assists in a battle against the Oktober Guard during the escape of a Russian defector.G.I. Joe: Special Missions #1 (October 1986) He assists other Joes in the secret construction of The Pit II.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #64 (October 1987) Action Force The Marvel UK 'Action Force' comics maintained a different G.I. Joe continuity. Shipwreck is featured in these stories, starting with issue one.\\"Action Force\\" #1 (March 1987) He later helps raid a Crimson Guard outpost.\\"Action Force\\" #7 (April 1987) He assists in preventing Cobra from gaining control of the criminal syndicates of Venice, Italy.Action Force # 49, February 6, 1988 Devil's Due 150px Devil's Due Publishing introduced Shipwreck in a storyline based on his later filecards when he trained to become a Navy SEAL. The first issue of the G.I. Joe: Battle Files makes mention on his activities between the disbandment and reinstatement of the Joe Team. He was running tour guide operations and busting pirates and drug smugglers in between. Shipwreck is one of the first Joes called back to active duty,\\"G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero\\" Vol 2. #1 (2002) and is one of the few Joes unaffected by Cobra's nanite-based weapons. As such, he is one of the many on-foot military defenders on the White House lawn; they are there to stop a Cobra takeover. Despite losses, including Greenshirts, Cobra is defeated.\\"G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero\\" Vol 2. #2-4 (2002) The Joe Team would be disbanded once more and reformed with a smaller core group in the series, G.I. Joe: America’s Elite. Shipwreck is included in the new team and is one of the more vocal critics for including Storm Shadow in the lineup. In America's Elite, Shipwreck's appearance changes. Originally, he has unkempt red-brown hair and a slender build. Some time after issue 12, he appears stockier and with black hair and a neatly trimmed beard (however, in real life, U.S. Navy personnel are not permitted to grow facial hair because such hair could potentially diminish the effectiveness of emergency underwater breathing apparatus). Animated series Sunbow Shipwreck also appeared in G.I. Joe animated series from Sunbow and Marvel voiced by Neil Ross while Polly's vocal effects are provided by Ross or by Frank Welker, depending on the episode. The show's voice director Wally Burr wanted Neil to make Shipwreck sound like a cross between Jack Nicholson (like the actor's character in The Last Detail) and Popeye the Sailor man. He is one of the more fleshed out characters in the series. He first appeared in the 1984 miniseries, \\"The Revenge of Cobra\\", as offering Flint and Mutt a way back to Joe headquarters on his land sail. The Joe Team offered Shipwreck a spot on the membership roster which he gladly accepted. Shipwreck played a major role in a subplot in the \\"Pyramid of Darkness\\" mini-series. He and Snake Eyes have to fight their way out of a Cobra stronghold, and are later rescued through the efforts of a popular lounge singer named Satin. Shipwreck continued to be a recurring character through the regular series. He has a pet parrot named \\"Polly\\" that he pretends to despise. The bird is capable of dozens of phrases; they often relate to the action. On missions, Shipwreck was often paired off with Cover Girl. Shipwreck was among the number of Joes whose relatives were captured and brainwashed by Cobra in \\"Captives of Cobra\\". In the same episode, Shipwreck tells his adopted nephew that he himself was also adopted and they are both lucky to have such loving families. \\"Memories of Mara\\" found Shipwreck in love with an escaped Cobra agent named Mara, who was part of an experimental procedure to create amphibious soldiers who could breathe on land and in water. However, the experiment was only partially successful with Mara, who could no longer breathe out of water for more than a few minutes. In the highly rated two-part season finale \\"There’s No Place Like Springfield\\", his emotions and mental state would be toyed with when he is trapped in a town filled with synthoid copies of his friends and loved ones, including Mara and another synthoid called Althea, who was posing as his daughter from his false marriage to Mara. During the two-parter, Shipwreck is tormented by visions of many of his long-term Joe friends. He would perceive them as normal, then they would melt away in front of him. Also in part 2 of the episode, Shipwreck's origins are revealed when a female Cobra Crimson Guard named Cadet Deming interrogates him, by using a hazardous psychedelic mind control program. (This ruse was also used in Inside Out (1975 film) to fool Reinhardt Holtz into believing he was in a different time and place.) The second season finds Shipwreck appearing less but still managing to participate in major roles in episodes he does appear in. Shipwreck is featured in the episode \\"Once Upon A Joe\\", as he entertains orphans while their home is being rebuilt. Shipwreck also appears in two of the series' Public Service Announcements. In the first, he talks a couple of kids out of stealing a bike by showing them how wrong it is. In the second, he talks a boy out of running away from home following an argument with his parents, suggesting that he solve his problems by talking to his parents. G.I. Joe: The Movie Shipwreck also appeared briefly in the 1987 animated film G.I. Joe: The Movie, albeit in a more diminished capacity, as a captive of Cobra-La. Spy Troops and Valor vs. Venom Shipwreck appeared in the direct-to-video CGI animated movies G.I. Joe: Spy Troops and G.I. Joe: Valor vs. Venom, voiced by Lee Tockar. Resolute Shipwreck also has a small cameo in G.I. Joe: Resolute movie. He is seen on the flagship amongst many other Joes, yet he has no dialogue. Renegades Shipwreck appeared in the G.I. Joe: Renegades episode \\"Shipwrecked\\" as a Latin American voiced by Carlos Alazraqui. Hector Delgado was a ship captain for Cobra, until Cobra had his ship sunk when he wouldn't do some dumping at sea on their behalf, and blamed him for his own ship sinking. G.I. Joe has to trade the \\"Coyote\\" in order to carry them on their ship to Washington, DC. During the cruise to Washington, G.I. Joe's package gets loose, unleashing an energy-draining Techno-Viper that drains the electricity from Shipwreck's ship. Shipwreck helps G.I. Joe when it comes to stopping the Techno-Viper before it reaches a heavily populated area. Shipwreck and G.I. Joe have no choice but to sink the ship. G.I. Joe had to use the fire extinguishers in order to take down the Techno-Viper. Shipwreck still wasn't willing to lose his ship, causing Roadblock to drive the \\"Coyote\\" that the Techno-Viper was on into the water. Shipwreck's ship managed to catch the \\"Coyote,\\" and gives Roadblock the \\"Coyote\\" back. Shipwreck joins up with G.I. Joe, when the Techno-Viper's signal is traced to Scotland, as Shipwreck still has a score to settle with Cobra Industries. Video games Shipwreck appears as a playable character in the video game G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. Other media * Shipwreck appears in the Robot Chicken episode \\"Toy Meets Girl\\" voiced by Breckin Meyer. In the \\"Where Are They Now\\" segment, Shipwreck is kidnapped for food by a Chinese restaurant chef. Seth Green later voiced Shipwreck in the episode \\"More Blood, More Chocolate.\\" In the \\"Inside the Battlefield: The Weather Dominator\\" segment, Shipwreck participated in the North Pole hockey tournament against some Cobra soldiers. In \\"PS: Yes In That Way,\\" Shipwreck is among the G.I. Joe members that makes fun of the new recruit Calvin (who had been nicknamed \\"Fumbles\\"). Shipwreck and his parrot Polly are later sniped by Calvin. In \\"The Ramblings of Maurice,\\" he is with the G.I. Joe team when Roadblock is rewarded for his services. Shipwreck was present at Junkyard's funeral. * A modified 1994 Shipwreck action figure was used in the live-action Nickelodeon TV Series Action League Now!.

The game's framing uses the same loose Star Trek framing as Empire; the universe is two dimensional, with the user's starship placed in the center of their tactical screen. Ships have phasers which fire in a cone, with damage proportionate to distance, a limited number of torpedoes that can be in flight at any given time and which proceed in a straight line until they hit a target or time out, deflector shields, a range of warp speeds, and a limited energy supply that slowly automatically regenerates.

Webster reviewed Galactic Attack in The Space Gamer No. 43. Webster commented that \\"I recommend Galactic Attack with few reservations. If gives you far more for your money than a lot of other games costing the same. Because the difficulty level can be adjusted to a very high point, it will be a long time before you master this game.\\" Dick Richards reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"As this is a real time game, it demands quick thinking — indecision can be fatal — because the computer controlled Kzinti never hesitates.\\" Reviews * Casus Belli #19 (Feb 1984) References External links * Sir-Tech's catalog from mocagh.org * Forgotten ruins: The roots of computer role-playing games: Sir-tech from https://venturebeat.com/ 1980 video games Apple II games Apple II-only games Sir-Tech games Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Galactic Attack"},{"id":"5791010","text":"The Ford 2GA was a car produced by the Ford in 1942 and came stock with a 90 hp, 6-cylinder engine.

Meanwhile, the King's town crier, Grover, reminds King Fred that Princess Charming has until midnight to find someone to marry or lose the kingdom altogether. The King decides to invite every man and monster in the kingdom. Shortly the word is sent out around the kingdom. The Stepmother teaches her sons a new dance in preparation for the ball. Baker Cookie Monster arrives as a General Invitation Deliverer and gives CinderElmo an invitation to the ball, but the Stepmother won't permit him. When the horse and carriage arrive, she locks CinderElmo and his friends up in the house. When CinderElmo wishes upon a falling star, his Fairy God person comes and encourages CinderElmo to come up with some plan and \\"so something\\" to make his dreams come true. After CinderElmo has a wash, Fairy God person provides him and Zoe with smart clothes, turns the dog into a handsome prince, turns the dog bowl into a carriage, and the mice into horses.

The Eureka Seven anime and manga series features an extensive cast of characters created by Bones. The central protagonist of the series is Renton Thurston, a young boy who joins the renegade group Gekkostate to fight against the U.F. Force, led by Dewey Novak. In naming the characters, writer Dai Sato drew inspiration from club bands and the music culture of his generation. He said, \\"The youngest generation is represented by references to dance music, techno, and house. Hip hop represents the next generation, and rock represents the oldest generation.” Although the show is primarily targeted towards the kid demographic, he hoped to draw in some viewers who might have hung out at clubs at night.  Gekkostate  Gekkostate is an anti-government militia and counterculture collective led by Holland, who also pilots the LFO Terminus typeR909. Eureka, an aloof, pale girl, pilots an LFO called the Nirvash typeZERO. After joining Gekkostate early in the series, Renton co-pilots the Nirvash with Eureka. Stoner is a photographer who writes Gekkostate's illegal magazine, ray=out. Talho is the head pilot of Gekkostate's aircraft, the and also ray=out's covergirl. Hap is Holland's childhood friend and the second-in-command of the Gekko. Ken-Goh is the weapons specialist and owner of the Gekko. Jobs and Woz are the ship's engineers, for hardware and software, respectively. Mischa is the resident doctor. Moondoggie is a secondary pilot and operator of the launch catapult. Hilda and Matthieu are the pilots of the Gekkostate LFOs Terminus typeR808 and Terminus typeR606, respectively. Gidget is the communications operator. Finally, Gonzy is a fortuneteller. Renton Thurston is the main protagonist of Eureka Seven. He is the son of Adroc Thurston and co-pilot (later pilot) of the Nirvash TypeZERO. He is named after Mark Renton, a character from the film Trainspotting, and Thurston Moore, guitarist of Sonic Youth. Early in Eureka Seven, he immediately falls in love with Eureka and joins Gekkostate to follow Holland Novak, his idol, and also to be with Eureka. He eventually becomes a responsible adult as the series progresses. He also goes on to become a hero by uniting the humans and Scub Coral, and saving the world with Eureka. In Eureka Seven: AO, he is married to Eureka and has a son named Ao and a daughter named Amber. He is a mechanic genius and becomes famous after creating the first IFO in Eureka Seven: AO. Yuri Lowenthal had at one point been contracted by Bandai to provide the English voice for Renton, but after recording thirteen episodes he was replaced by Johnny Yong Bosch because the director of the English dub felt that his voice was too low for the character. All of Renton's lines were subsequently redone for consistency (although Yuri Lowenthal can still be heard as Renton when Holland is watching a video at the end of episode 7), though Bosch himself admits it took him a while to nail down the voice. Theron Martin of Anime News Network stated in his review of the series' first DVD that \\"Renton is a pretty normal male lead for a series like this.\\" However, while initially describing him as immature, Martin later said in his review of the seventh DVD that \\"Renton proves that he has grown up a bit by not being thrown for a loop by learning what makes Eureka special.\\" Eureka is a young Coralian in human form, who is sent by the sentient Scub Coral to understand and communicate with humans before the beginning of the series. She is the pilot of the Nirvash typeZERO. Although she is the female protagonist of Eureka Seven, she also becomes the mother to the main protagonist of Eureka Seven: AO. She undergoes many physical changes and suffers from identity problems throughout the series. In Eureka Seven, she is at first considered to be Holland Novak's partner. However, upon meeting Renton Thurston when she crash-lands in his hometown, she realizes that he is actually the one who will make her smile and declares him as her partner. She later develops a romantic relationship with Renton. In Eureka Seven: AO, Eureka has married Renton and has a daughter named Amber and a son named Ao. Eureka was ranked 18th in the female character category of the Anime Grand Prix in 2005. In his review of the series' first DVD, Theron Martin of Anime News Network described Eureka as \\"calm, sensible, and soft-spoken but not necessarily shy...and is quite capable of showing joy, sadness, or earnestness without resorting to the exaggerated expressions and reactions so common in anime.\\" Martin also said in his review of the sixth DVD that \\"Eureka is hardly the first person in an anime series who struggles to understand and cope with...love, but she does it more convincingly than most.\\" Maurice, Maeter and Linck , , and (collectively named after the author Maurice Maeterlinck) are three orphans adopted by Eureka. Before the beginning of the series, they are discovered under a pile of corpses during the massacre at Ciudades del Cielo. They soon join the Gekkostate and are adopted by Eureka. When they first meet Renton, they often play practical jokes on him and were opposed to his relationship with Eureka, whom they think of as their mother. But they eventually accept Renton as their adoptive father. Holland Novak is the leader of Gekkostate, captain of the Gekko (Moonlight in the manga) and pilot of the LFO Terminus typeR909. He is also the brother of Dewey Novak. Before meeting Renton, he rescues Eureka and finds out from Norb that there will be a partner who will make Eureka smile. Holland eventually mutinies and organizes the Gekkostate. When he meets Renton, Holland develops a rivalry with the boy due to Renton getting more of Eureka's attention. Eventually, he reconciles with Renton after realizing that the boy is, in fact, Eureka's partner, thus fulfilling Norb's prophecy. During the series, he is also in a relationship with Talho. Talho Yūki is the main helmsman of the Gekko and Holland Novak's girlfriend. She meets Holland and Dewey when the three of them served together in the military and initially worked in the Information Bureau before being demoted to a spy later on. She is at first jealous of Eureka due to her gaining her attention with Holland. She befriends Renton aboard the Gekkostate and stops being jealous when Holland professes his love for her during the course of the series. Eventually, she becomes pregnant with Holland's child and surrenders her position as the head pilot to Moondoggie in order to execute her final field mission. While Holland becomes a LFO pilot, she takes his place as the captain of the Gekko. Matthieu is the easygoing, afro- haired pilot of the Terminus typeR606 who has a passion for music, and seems to be constantly bored. Matthieu gathers information from and maintains contacts with ref boarders and disc jockeys. Matthieu and Hilda often act like husband and wife. Hilda orders Matthieu around as if he is her husband, and Matthieu treats Hilda as if she is his wife. Hilda is the pilot of the Terminus typeR808 and Talho's best friend who keeps track of the Gekkostate's provisions and mechanical parts. In this capacity, she is generally in charge of the frequent trips to cities to replenish the organization's supplies. She also takes care of Maurice, Linck, and Maeter, and is shown to be very good at cooking. Hilda also has a close relationship with Matthieu. Stoner is the photographer and journalist for ray=out, an underground lifter-culture periodical magazine where he denounces the military's crimes and depicts the daily life of the Gekkostate members to their fans around the world. Stoner is a pacifist and often rides with Matthieu. Stoner is given to expounding on his philosophical ideas at any time and place, including those which may be least appropriate, such as from the back seat of the 606 in the middle of LFO combat. He also likes to take photos mid-flight, and often requests Matthieu fly in such a way as to make his pictures come out perfectly, in spite of the situation. He is based on Che Guevara. Ken-Goh is both the owner and the chief gunner of the Gekko. Not much was known about his history with Holland, but dialogue implies that he had something to do with the building of or security on board the Gekko. He once stated that \\"[he] would not have let [Holland] have the Gekko if [he was]...\\", cutting off his statement before actually revealing the reason. His marksmanship skills are exceptional and his aim is legendary among the other crew members. Holland refers to him as \\"Maestro\\" from time to time. He also enjoys painting and his works are often seen in ray=out. Micha is the Gekkostate's doctor. Before the beginning of the series, she is a military scientist specializing in studying Eureka and the Nirvash. However, she leaves the military to join the Gekkostate. On the ship, Micha often reminds Talho Yūki and Holland Novak on how to keep the Gekkostate from being dissolved. Gonzy Not much is known about , but he has a habit of unexpectedly appearing nearby whenever anyone is troubled, usually sitting on a carpet and calmly drinking tea. He often invites whoever is nearby to have tea with him. Gonzy was originally a stowaway aboard the Gekko, but was allowed to stay in part because the others respect his abilities at fortune-telling. Though not a priest of Vodarac, he gives the image of a spiritualistic man. He's known to give out information out of the blue when it is most needed. When the crew went into a health craze, most of the members followed Gonzy doing various exercises to maintain health such as T'ai chi and eating healthy foods. It wasn't until towards near the end when the Gekkostate members wondered the fate of their world that Gonzy explains that the event they are witnessing is the \\"Second Summer of Love\\". When Gonzy reveals that he knows about the Second Summer of Love, he opens both of his eyes (concealed under his thick eyebrows during the entire series) revealing the purple eyes of a human-form Coralian. Just as Holland and the crew realize the truth, Gonzy thanks them for a good time and disappears, leaving his clothing behind. He does not seem meant for the \\"blank slate\\" as Sakuya and Eureka, but rather as an educated observer. It is unknown when or how Gonzy presumably communicated with the Scub Coral, or if he communicates only after his disappearance, but given his likely position and so influence as observer, it is very possible that he was partly responsible for the Command Cluster's decision to trust humanity (namely Eureka, Renton, and those fighting at their side) with, essentially, the saving of all life on the planet. In the fourth manga book of the series he was revealed by Holland to be a former elder (as opposed to sage as is used in the anime), and, in addition to this, Holland calls him Gon Karmapa. Jobs Living up to his name, does the random jobs on the Gekko and also manages the majority of the hardware aboard the Gekko. Primarily, he's Gekko's engineer and often is found around the core systems room when the ship requires extra attention in powered flights or battles. He is always immaculately dressed in a shirt, vest, and tie. He also has a calm, expert bearing, but he occasionally lets these mannerisms slip when something is mentioned that particularly excites him. Like Gonzy, he was originally a stowaway, but allowed to stay because of his talents. He admires \\"Dr. \\"Bear,\\" as seen in episode 31, and is a huge fan of Dr. Bear's research and engineering theories. He is modeled after Steve Jobs (hence, \\"Jobs\\"), one of the co-founders of Apple. Woz is sometimes called \\"Woz the Whiz\\". He is the ship's hacker and maintains the ship's software. He and Jobs were originally stowaways aboard the Gekko, but they were invited to stay because of their technical skills. He and Jobs tend to argue over how best to configure the Gekko's systems, since Woz insists on rewriting the control systems to compensate for every modification Jobs makes while Jobs asserts that the software is fully capable of supporting the changes. His hippy attitude and grunge attire are a deep contrast to Jobs, but they seem to maintain a strong friendship anyway. He is modeled after Steve Wozniak (hence, \\"Woz\\"), another of Apple's co-founders. Hap is the second-in-command, handles Gekkostate's finances, and manages information (not to be confused with Gidget's position of communications). While on the bridge in action, Hap's job is to monitor trapar levels, though he is also there frequently at night trying to obtain intel on matters crucial to the Gekkostate. He is also one of Holland's childhood buddies (since they were three years old, he asserts), and played a key role in convincing Holland and his SOF team to desert. He gained his nickname from his ever-present \\"happy smile\\". Hap is very parsimonious when it comes to spending money and is also notably nonathletic. Gidget is a young woman who serves as the sensor and communications officer of the Gekkostate. Her role is considered secondary and often she's featured relaying tactical data to crew or talking about relationship issues with Eureka. She is in a romantic relationship with Moondoggie. She is based on the titular character of the Gidget franchise. Moondoggie is the second-newest member of the Gekkostate (the newest being Renton). He is initially in charge of the LFO catapult systems and launch pads on board the Gekko, but later he becomes the ship's helmsman, replacing Talho when she has to leave the post, as he is the group's only other licensed pilot, it is also revealed that his real name is James Darren Emerson. Moondoggie often has confidence issues when comparing himself to the other members of Gekkostate concerning his usefulness and importance as a member of the team, this is the main reason he volunteered to replace Talho at the helm of the Gekko. He is based on a character from the Gidget movies, TV shows, and novel. The original Doggie was the boyfriend of the original Gidget and was a committed surf bum.  U.F. Force  The U.F. Force is a military unit under the command of the Sage Council (or The Council of the Wise), the main authority of the United Federation of Predgio Towers. Serving under the Sage Council is Lieutenant Colonel Dewey Novak, who directed a special operations force called the SOF prior to his imprisonment at the beginning of the series. Dominic Sorel is an intelligence officer under Novak and the chief handler of Anemone, who pilots the LFO Nirvash type theEND. Anemone is the pilot of the Nirvash LFO, typeTheEND. Introduced as Dewey Novak's henchwoman and assassin, she is a human who becomes an experimental subject to turn her into a Coralian. She is envious of Eureka as well as the Nirvash typeZERO. Eventually, after being defeated numerous times by the Gekkostate and upon realizing Dewey's own actions, she betrays him for the Gekkostate. She later falls in love with her caretaker Dominic after saving him from certain death, having been convinced by Renton and Eureka to show her feelings for him. In its review of the series' second DVD, Anime News Network criticized Anemone's character design, calling it \\"silly and too-angular\\", but \\"a good match for her personality.\\" The site also said in its review of the third DVD that \\"Anemone is a great, though not likeable, addition as a character whose attitude is as sharp-edged as her appearance but far more troubled and rotten.\\" Her name and personality is a possible reference to a Sea anemone. Dominic Sorel is the youngest to be a second lieutenant and Dewey's subordinate. He is assigned to Anemone to tend to her needs and monitor her physical and mental condition. It is never explained why Dominic was promoted so fast, especially given his occasional naivete. There are men in the military far older than he is and yet of much lower rank, who often have trouble obeying his orders. Dominic is also aware that commanding officers give him a hard time following his orders for Dewey as they think he's still a kid. Dominic is mainly a field officer, constantly working on investigations and field missions for Dewey. If he's not on the ground investigating or on covert missions, he's in the air tending to Anemone. At one point, Dominic was ordered to investigate Renton's grandfather. Seeing how the Thurstons tend to have an effect on the world, Dewey wanted to gather more information from Renton's grandfather. After crashing his motorcycle, Dominic spent a day with Renton's grandpa and got to know him. After staying over the night to get his bike fixed, Renton's grandfather spoke to Dominic in a moving way to look after Renton like family, saying he considers Dominic family as well. Dominic decides not to report the incident, but it is anyway, as Dewey had men watching Dominic's movements. Dewey never seems concerned about this fact, or Dominic's somewhat overt distaste for Dewey's methods, and in fact seems to consider Dominic to be a harmless but occasionally useful tool that can be safely ignored. Eventually, Dominic turns away from Dewey after witnessing the sick human experiments used to create girls like Anemone. He joins up with the crew of the Super Izumo and Gekkostate in an attempt to stop Dewey and rescue Anemone. Even though he acknowledges his love as one-sided, he goes out of his way to look out for Anemone. He even risks his life in an attempt to stop Anemone from interfering with Renton and Eureka, taking a small shuttle into a rapidly sealing hole that Anemone had used to reach them. Though unsuccessful, the act is enough to convince her to stop and for her to finally return his feelings. After \\"Second Summer of Love\\", they are seen camping next to Dominic's bike. Dominic makes several brief appearances in TR2: New Vision, the events of which take place before the anime. He first shows up to tell 2nd Lieutenant Steven Bisson of Sumner and Moondoggie's connection to Gekkostate, and subtly chides him for losing track of Sumner in the first place. Toward the end of the game, he leads the military fleet that arrives to attack Thundercloud tower, which had, by then, fallen under the control of Steven's renegade forces. His final appearance is after the credits, in which he silently and stoically watches as a KLF squadron is dispatched to Bellforest, presumably to hunt down Eureka and the Nirvash at the beginning of the series. A bit of a running gag in Eureka Seven is Dominic's inability to use and understand maps. Because of this, Renton calls Dominic a \\"genuine idiot\\" twice. In the manga, Dominic dies shielding Renton from anti-body coralians as Renton tries to cure the Scub Coral of a disease TheEND injected into it. Critics such as Don Houston of DVD Talk have noted the similarities between Dominic and Renton; Dominic cares for Anemone in much the same way that Renton does for Eureka. Later episodes \\"show an opponent of Renton studying his own complicity in the events unraveling before him\\". Dewey Novak is the main antagonist of Eureka Seven. Through a combination of charisma and brains, he seizes control of the U.F. as part of his bloodstained quest to rid the world of the Scub Coral. As the former commander of the notorious SOF, Dewey distinguished himself by waging genocidal campaigns against the Vodarek people. However, his career came to a screeching halt when he was accused of helping his younger brother, Holland, defect from the military. This was apparently part of a concerted attempt by the Sage Council to shut down the remnants of Adroc Thurston's project. By order of the government, Dewey is later released and promoted to colonel. He subsequently takes Dominic and Anemone under his command. In a complicated and carefully calculated plan, he undermines the public's faith in the Sage Council and overthrows them. According to Dewey, the Novak family existed to calm the planet. The ritual to do so involved an act of patricide, an act that Dewey assumed was reserved for him. However, in an unforeseen turn of events, his mother died while giving birth to his younger brother, Holland. Consequently, the title of \\"Sacrificial King\\" was automatically passed on to his newborn sibling. With his ambitions of becoming the Novak family's next patriarch ruined, Dewey murdered his father in cold blood only to have the planet \\"reject\\" the ritual and his succession. With no legitimate heir, the other noble families seized the Novak family's assets and left Dewey and Holland homeless. As a result, Dewey bears a pathological hatred for his brother as well as the planet for denying him what he believed to be his birthright. However, the only account of this event is given by Dewey to Anemone. It is possible that parts of it might actually be a delusion he created. At the end of the series, Holland admits that he did not know how Dewey's madness came to be. Dewey also bears a deep hatred for the Scub, and focuses his efforts on destroying it throughout the series. This hatred is such that by the end of the series, Dewey now sees the planet it absorbed as beyond redemption and comes to a final conclusion. To further that idea, during his final confrontation with Holland, Dewey revealed to his brother that he secretly had a Compac Drive embedded in his chest, much like Norb. His Compac Drive, however, is more like a dead man's switch which he claims binds him to the Earth itself. He states that the entire world will die with him. Dewey foresaw that Eureka or Anemone would become the replacement Scub Coral command center in the event of the existing command center's destruction. As a result, he had special collars attached to both girls that would be activated upon his death (this is done before the events of the series). In the anime, his confrontation with Holland climaxes with Dewey shooting himself in the head to set his plan of planetary genocide in motion, while in the manga, Holland kills him in a duel. This results in the activation of the collars' self-destruct sequence that is meant to be relayed throughout the Scub Coral should either girl merge with it. Holland is found moments afterward with tears in his eyes confessing that he was \\"too late to save \\" Dewey, showing a rare moment of sympathy and love for his brother. He goes on in episode 50 to say that he will shoulder Dewey's \\"burden\\", even if it takes the rest of his life. Council of the Sages The Council of the Sages is the main authority in U.F., apparently located in the same starship that brought mankind to the planet or at what is known as the Capital. They were the few of those aware of the planet's true nature and hid it from the masses until Dewey exposed the \\"truth\\" to the public. From there, Dewey disbanded the sages, killing Braya and Kuzemi in the process. Koda, the remaining sage, handed power over to Dewey afterwards. It is unknown what happened to Koda after. In the manga version, Dewey kills the three sages and takes power. Ageha Squad The Ageha Squad is an anti-Coralian unit created by Dewey, composed primarily of five specially trained children whom Dewey rescued from a refugee camp. Skilled, resourceful, and lethal, these five enjoy their work as children would. They are blissfully unconcerned about the immense number of people killed as a result of their efforts, and are only interested in Dewey's responses. It is revealed by Captain Jurgens in episode 50 that they were found by Colonel Dewey in Warsaw, victims of an ethnic cleansing. Captain Jurgens is the captain of the ship Izumo and a hardened soldier who survived the war which saw the death of his wife and two daughters. Jurgens is a loyal soldier, and initially follows his orders whether or not he agrees with them. He eventually finds his personal limit after reading the last issue of ray=out. He helps to spread Gekkostate's message by spreading the video of the meeting between Norb and Dr. Bear across every military channel, essentially informing the entire military. His efforts, however, only manage to secure the loyalty of his own ship. After that, he begins operating against Dewey and supports Gekkostate's action along with Dominic (although Dominic defected to Gekkostate, Jurgens did not). He is seen along with Holland in the beginning of episode 50 talking about the Ageha Squad, and how he is thinking of taking care of them as redemption for his crimes making the world how it is (meaning blindly following orders up until he helps Gekkostate). It has been subtly hinted throughout the series that he has some feelings for or is in some kind of relationship with Maria Schneider. Maria Schneider is the executive officer of the Izumo and trusted right-hand woman of Jurgens. At her computer station on the Izumo's bridge, her desktop wallpaper is a cartoon bunny wearing clothes. It has been subtly hinted throughout the series that she has some feelings for or is in some kind of relationship with Captain Jurgens.  Logica  Logica is a character who appears only in the manga. As a member of the SOF, he is a former colleague of Holland's and bears a strong resentment towards him for defecting. He is downed by Holland in an aerial battle and then later killed by Anemone's TheEnd. He piloted a standard black Terminus-505 LFO, the basic mech used by the SOF.  Yauchi  Yauchi is a character who appears only in the manga. He is a priest and a scientist who serves under Dewey Novak. Originally he believed that Dewey was the world's savior but was later proven wrong after witnessing his actions. During Dewey's final conflict with Holland aboard his ship, Yauchi betrays him and locks the two inside the bridge eventually leading to the deaths of Dewey and his control team.  Dr. Diamond  Dr. Diamond is a scientist who appears only in the manga. He studies the Nirvash's Amita Drive and wants to learn about the Coralians.  Civilians  Axel Thurston is Renton's grandfather, Adroc's father, and a renowned technician who is responsible for Renton's on-the-job education in mechanical engineering. He initially opposed Renton's idea to join Gekkostate, but later he decided to let him go, because he thinks he should see the world for himself, and he also thinks, in the end, that Renton will come back to live with him. He was the one who gave the Amita Drive to Renton, and also created both versions of the typeZERO's ref boards. Yucatán Iglasias Yucatán Iglasias is Renton's uncle, who runs a produce farm in his childhood hometown of Controrado. He catches Renton, Matthieu, and Eureka when they try to steal a Pancha Fruit from his farm; the three are forced to make up stories about military service to keep him in the dark about Renton's involvement with Gekkostate. Renton is often annoyed by Yucatán's overly patriotic attitude, though he does not hold it against him. During Renton's visit in \\"Human Behaviour\\", the military was called in to apprehend his companions, but after they escaped, Yucatán was incarcerated in their place. He owns an M1 Garand battle rifle. Charles Beams is a freelance LFO pilot and mercenary, with his partner and wife Ray. The Beams are first hired by the military to retrieve Eureka and the Nirvash from them. Renton stays with Charles and his wife after leaving the Gekkostate, but Renton soon realizes his true intentions to capture Eureka and the Nirvash and returns to the Gekkostate as a result. Later, Charles is killed by Holland during a gun fight in the Gekko's hangar. His name is based on the designers Charles and Ray Eames. Ray Beams is Charles' fighting partner and wife, and apparently served with him in the SOF. Before the beginning of the series, she becomes unable to bear children due to being in the blast radius of the Seven Swell that kickstarted the Summer of Love. When Renton temporarily joins Charles and Ray on the Swan, Ray immediately bonds with him. To her, Renton is the child she has never had and with his presence finally makes her feel like she has a true family. However, she is devastated to learn that Renton is not only Adroc Thurston's son but also a member of Gekkostate. She eventually realizes that Eureka is in love with him and causes her to develop a rivalry with the Coralian. After Charles's death drives Ray into madness, she attempts to destroy the Gekko in a kamikaze attack in the hopes of her, Renton, and Charles being able to reunite in the afterlife. However, she is killed by Holland when he destroys the Swan. As with Charles, Ray's name is based on the designers Charles and Ray Eames, however her name also serves as a pun for light rays or beams. Tiptory is a member of an anti-Federation indigenous religious group called Vodarac (specifically, the sect thereof that is loyal to Norb). She is introduced when Gekkostate made a deal with the military to capture her and turn her in for money, even though Gekkostate themselves are against the Federation. Though the attempt appears legitimate, it is actually a setup to prevent the Federation from capturing her directly. After presenting her as a captive and receiving their payment, Gekkostate rescues her. She is then dropped off at Ciudades del Cielo, the place of Vodarac's pilgrimage, and the place of Holland's darkest memories. She later shows up to greet Norb upon his return to the Vodarac homeland. She later appears throughout the series in small moments though there is rarely any dialogue. Norb is a Vodarac priest. Before the beginning of the series, he convinces Holland leaving the SOF after Norb explains to him what Dewey is trying to do and the consequences it entails for the planet and humanity. During his childhood, he is given the task to be the guardian of what the Vodarac believed to be their messiah but is actually the first Coralian girl spawned by the Scub Coral. At first, Norb attempts to maintain the solemn duty of simply doing tasks for this being, or Sakuya, as she would later tell him, but later earns her affection after giving her a lotus flower. However, Sakuya is transformed into a giant lotus flower and Norb is left with a Compac Drive embedded into his chest that originally materialized from Sakuya's remains. The Compac Drive in his chest gives Norb strange powers. These powers included the ability to shut-off or disrupt other Compac Drives, manipulate Scub Coral and cause it to rise as barriers, and even manipulate Trapar energy to the point of using it as an offensive weapon. Sakuya is Eureka's predecessor, sporting lavender hair. Because she was a girl of mysterious power, the religious authority of Vodarac thought she was some sort of messiah and placed her in the central part of the temple. They banned any disciple from speaking to her, and allowed very few select disciples to care for her in a highly reverent, if sterile, manner. For forty years since her initial appearance, she had no significant contact with anyone. This changes when Norb is assigned to care for her. Norb and Sakuya fell in love. Though they tried to keep it secret at first, a priest catches them embracing and assumes it to be a sign that Sakuya has chosen someone to travel to the Scub Coral with. They are hurriedly sent to cross the zone, but fail in the attempt. Both Sakuya and Norb suffer some sort of physical deformation but Sakuya is by far the most affected since she is turned into a giant lotus flower. After her transformation, Sakuya erects a barrier around temple city, blocking out everything, including trapar (which is now poisonous to her). Norb eventually brings the Gekkostate to meet Sakuya, since her help is needed to get Renton and Eureka past the Great Wall successfully. Eureka meets with Sakuya in another reality in the form of a library. There they talk about what they learned and how Sakuya and Norb first met. After sending Eureka back, she and Norb stay in the temple to disable the barrier around it and use the energy to help Eureka and Renton pass through the Great Wall. For Sakuya and Norb, they were taken to the Zone where they could be together while Renton and Eureka discovered Earth. Morita is the head of the Tresor military research complex. He was one of the scientists who studied the first Archetype after its unearthing and worked on both versions of the Nirvash typeZERO. Morita is also acquainted with Axel Thurston through Axel's work on the first LFO ref board for the Nirvash. He also knows Holland, though in the past they don't get along well (for unstated reasons). Dr. Greg \\"Bear\\" Egan Nicknamed \\"Dr. Bear\\" for his physically huge body, is an iconoclastic scientist who was also part of the Tresor research team that initially studied Eureka and her relationship with the Nirvash. He was renowned as an \\"out-of-the-box\\" thinker capable of combining various theories into a workable gestalt. He was previously married to Mischa of Gekkostate, and tends to act as if they were still lovers - for instance, he calls her \\"My little cub\\" and \\"kuma-chan\\", the latter meaning \\"bear\\". His behaviour often prompts Mischa to take an even sterner tone than usual with him. He is fond of candy, often has a stash of it somewhere on his person, and once told Renton that the candy was part of an important memory in his relationship with Mischa. Possessing many insights on the Scub Coral, the Coralians, LFOs, and Eureka, Bear is both stunned and overjoyed to learn that from a scientific viewpoint they were found to be almost identical to the Vodarac teachings of Norb; the similarities were revealed in a taped meeting aboard the Gekko. The underground video of this, along with the information published in Ray=Out became one of the main factors for many people, including some military leaders, to reject what Dewey's group was doing. His name references the science fiction writers Greg Bear and Greg Egan. Dr. Sonia Wakabayashi Another of Tresor's scientists, formerly studied Eureka along with Mischa. While apparently a good friend to Eureka, she's rather high-strung, and not as adaptable to the Gekkostate lifestyle as Mischa is. William B. \\"Will\\" Baxter is a young man who lives somewhat close to Gianas. He takes care of Renton during his return to the Gekkostate. He is a bit talkative, yet insightful and empathetic, preferring to work with nature rather than dominate it. He maintains a large vegetable garden that is almost impossible to navigate because of the tall grass growing with the crops. His garden thrives despite his dismantling of several huge pile bunkers that subdue tectonic movements. He lives with his wife and former engineer, , a victim of Desperation Disease. He speaks to her even though she never answers him audibly. To him, her condition doesn't evoke despair in him, therefore she does not suffer from Desperation Disease. In the end (when the world appears to be ending), Martha (and all the others suffering from Desperation Disease) are miraculously cured. While William was outside tending to the garden, he turned around and saw Martha walking again. She smiled at him, and then a giant piece of shrapnel fell onto their house, killing them. Sumner Sturgeon & Ruri Though not having a role in the story, Sumner and Ruri are from the video games TR1: New Wave and New Vision and make a cameo appearance in episode 45, watching something launching into space; Ruri has the latest issue of ray=out in her pocket, and the two are apparently listening to a radio. The events surrounding Sumner take place a few years prior to that of the anime. They are also the main characters of the Eureka Seven: Gravity Boys and Lifting Girl prequel manga, which chronicles Sumner and Ruri's lives when they were Renton's age. Sumner Sturgeon is from the Sturgeon family, a prestigious family known for producing top-quality soldiers. His father, Bernard Sturgeon, is outspoken against the use of LFOs in the military, and is the first reason why he was recruited into New Wave Academy: to counter his father's actions. He possesses great skill in lifting and LFO piloting. Upon graduation, Sumner is transferred to Sawyer Team — an elite KLF group in the military that is said to be almost on par with Holland's SOF. Sumner never had any ambitions, goals or dreams before joining New Wave Academy. His only reason for joining was so that he could pilot the best LFOs. It is there he meets Ruri for the first time as a fellow cadet in New Wave. It is later revealed that Ruri leaves New Wave Academy upon discovering a dark truth about the academy and seeks refuge within the Vodarac, to whom she appears to be directly affiliated with at present. Sumner is unaware about Ruri's reasons for leaving, and continues to excel in the academy and serve as Sawyer Team's ace pilot. The two meet in the future during a solo mission given to Sumner to investigate the weapons black market in his area, but she later escapes as she was somewhat involved with the black market. Sumner is on patrol on another mission not long after Holland's mutiny, when he first meets a younger Moondoggie. He asks Moondoggie's purpose in town to which Moondoggie replied that he was there to meet Holland and join up with Gekkostate. Following a series of situations designed to draw away the Sawyer team from the tower, Sumner realizes the immediate Vodarac threat at the tower. It is then when meets Sumner meets Ruri once more while she is on a mission for the Vodarac (or possibly Gekkostate). Her objective was to secure the Nirvash and deliver it to Holland, while Sumner's objective was to protect the tower against terrorist attacks by the Vodarac. The two confront one another and it is then when Sumner's captain intervenes and shoots Ruri, injuring her arm. Sumner finally begins to realize the lies of the military, his feelings for Ruri, and what he believes is right. Surprising the captain and the Sawyer team (all of whom were his close friends), Sumner defects from the military to save Ruri from certain death. He manages to save her and has her board his LFO and escape with the promise that they will meet at their special place while he takes it upon himself to complete Ruri's objective. Sumner faces off against his teammates and defeats them while riding the Nirvash. His captain makes one last stand against Sumner and two battle at it, on military airport grounds and while airborne on refboards. Sumner proves to be the more skilled pilot and kills his captain in their aerial battle. Sumner then completes Ruri's mission and hands over the Nirvash to Holland. When asked about the purpose of the Nirvash, Holland merely replied that the Nirvash was meant to be piloted by only one person who can use it properly. Sumner sees over Holland's shoulder a younger Eureka staring at the Nirvash. Holland then recognizes Sumner's piloting and ref boarding abilities and invites him to join Gekkostate. Sumner declines saying that he wants to search for Ruri. Gekkostate departs with the Nirvash, leaving Sumner behind. While sitting at a campfire in the desert, a vehicle comes along that Sumner hails down. The driver is Moondoggie and he offers Sumner a ride out of the desert. TR1: New Wave ends here, with the story to be continued on New Vision. Some time later, he reunited with Ruri, and the two became involved with the refboard manufacturers known as Azure. Along with Moondoggie, they briefly traveled with Azure, sabotaging several military installations along the way. Eventually, they learned that Azure's activities were tied to a conspiracy within the military, spearheaded by former New Wave student Steven Bisson and Azure's leader, Roddy Flame. They were responsible for the proliferation of Compac Feedback Systems (CFS) throughout the military's LFO pilots, and were planning on using the technology to revolt and cause mass destruction. Sumner, Ruri, and Moondoggie fought against Azure and their Army benefactors, eventually defeating Steven and Flame and ending the threat. While Moondoggie returned to Gekkostate, Sumner and Ruri stayed together. Ruri is a student at New Wave and a friend of Sumner. She is an ace pilot and a good lifter, but left the academy after learning about the military's insidious motives, leaving her whereabouts unknown. Two years later, Sumner meets Ruri again. She explains that New Wave used data to steal the students' lifting moves and that she was bringing the Nirvash to Holland. She is in love with Sumner, and the two save the land from destruction. In the manga, Ruri is a spy of the Federation Military. She shows Dominic the truth about Dewey and helps free Renton and the Gekkostate. Adrock Thurston Renton's father, , was a military researcher considered a hero by the military. Original author of the Ageha Plan, which he then sought to have buried as being far too destructive to ever be implemented. His team was conducting experiments involving the Seven Swell phenomenon. It is revealed in a conversation between Eureka and Renton that Adrock vanished during an experiment on the Amita Drive. He prevented the full destructive force of the experiment from being unleashed by removing the Compac/Amita Drive from its socket in the Nirvash, interrupting the transdimensional rifting that would have led to the planet's destruction, but in the process was himself taken bodily into the rift it created; nothing of him or his uniform remained, save the Compac/Amita Drive. He was later declared dead, and a massive monument, now largely unvisited by an uninterested public, was erected in his home town of Bellforest. Later, it is revealed that his state of being was transferred to the Scub Coral along with other human beings, some of whom in normal reality were apparently suffering from the seeming catatonia caused by Despair Sickness. These individuals' consciousness apparently exist in a non-temporal state. They were staying in this form by their own will to communicate with and to attempt to understand the true nature of the Scub Coral. When Renton finally met with his father again, there was no hatred; Renton held his hand and was glad to see him without any animosity from his past feelings. Adrock has no voice actor throughout the series. The only scenes in which he appears are either narrated flashbacks or non-speaking roles. He is named after Ad-Rock, of the Beastie Boys. Diane Thurston is Axel's granddaughter and Renton's older sister. She and Axel were the ones who raised Renton after Adroc's death. She left home some years ago, and for initially unexplained reasons her family has not heard from her since. Despite appearing in Axel's family photos and in a silhouette in the series opening, her face isn't shown for the first 35 episodes — under many different circumstances, her face in flashbacks and photographs is always covered. Much of the first few episode's narration is made as if Renton was writing letters to his sister. Talho is troubled by Holland's past relationship with her and reacts with anxiety at her mention. Diane was obsessed with her father's research; so much that it affected her relationship with Holland. The terms of their breakup weren't thoroughly explained, but it is linked with her desire to more deeply understand Adroc's work. At some point, Diane somehow ended up in the command center of the Scub Coral. There, in a library artificially created by the Scub Coral, she and a small group of people read to understand the truth they seek. The vast knowledge they wish to seek would take almost a lifetime and all that remains are under their own volition. Even though Diane told Renton they'll stay together, the Scub Coral command center was blown away and Renton had to leave in order to save Eureka and the kids. It is suggested that the command center will return again and that Adroc and Diane are alive and well, continuing their reading. Kes Kes is a young girl who is seen in the manga. She meets Eureka when her grandmother sees Eureka in the village. Once the people in the village recognize Eureka, they begin to throw rocks at her. Kes asks Eureka to bring back her father whom Eureka killed. She also helped Matthieu and Hilda by telling them that Renton and Eureka were captured by the military. Génération Bleu is a company based in a Swiss mountain that is studying the Scub Coral and Secrets for their own personal gain. They have teams of IFO pilots at their disposal to seek their goal as well as owning a called the to detect Scub Coral appearances. Team Pied Piper is one of the teams used by Génération Bleu to investigate and study the Scub Coral and Secrets. ;: The protagonist of Eureka Seven: AO. Ao is the son of Renton Thurston and Eureka. He has his father's facial features and brown hair (until he first piloted the Nirvash Neo and it turned turquoise, like his mother's), but has his mother's eyes and skin color. His mother one day fell from a clear sky into a bay in Iwato Jima, Okinawa, before giving birth to Ao sometime later in 2012. After Eureka was handed over to the American Armed Forces ten years ago, as the islanders believe her and Ao's presence angered their local deity the \\"Sea Colossus\\" with the appearance of Scub Coral, Ao ended up in the care of his mother's only friend Dr. Toshio Fukai. During his middle school entrance ceremony, Ao discovers the RA272 Nirvash Mark One after he unintentionally retrieves his mother's bracelet from Gazelle who was smuggling it for the Japanese Army, and then Gazelle gets him to pilot the IFO, both named the Nirvash by Eureka and created by Renton. Ostracized by the villagers and targeted by the armies of several countries, Ao decides to join Team Pied Piper, hoping to find her. At the end of the series, Ao has altered reality where the Secrets didn't exist, left roaming in time distortion. He adopts some of Truth's traits. At birth, Renton and Eureka named their son Ao Thurston. He was renamed Ao Fukai by his adopted grandfather after Eureka's disappearance. ;: Fleur is a French 16-year-old IFO pilot for Team Pied Piper, piloting the RA164 Alleluia.

She is a reserved girl who is hard to read. She is an avid netizen and enjoys checking up on her favorite websites to see if they are updated, even in the field. She makes various references to anime, manga, and video games. Her helmet also bears a resemblance to Hello Kitty. She was originally known as Ellen Brooks, who lived in 1981 until Eureka saved her during a Scub burst near the Caribbean Sea that teleported her to the year 2020, falsely believing to have come from another world, where she ended up at American research facility making IFO pilots. Sometime before she was recruited, Ellen took the name \\"Elena Peoples\\" from another girl who died five years prior to the beginning of the series. Since then, Elena desires to return to Eureka's timeline thus showing an unconcealed hatred towards her, until she learns the truth. In an alternate history, Ellen remained in her original time and grown up as a captain of ARGO exploration ship. She saved the real Elena Peoples who eventually join Generation Bleu and pilots the RA304 Kyrie. ;: Ivica is a Balkan war veteran who met Eureka as an American soldier during the mission to prevent the Scub Burst in Okinawa that ended in her disappearance. After that, he accepts Christophe Blanc's invitation to join Génération Bleu and is nominated the chief of Team Pied Piper commanding its mothership, the Triton. He tries hard in every mission to protect the children piloting the IFOs.

His human form is first seen as the son of Johannson, a popular author who opposed the United States globalist tactics before committing suicide years ago. Without realizing he is a human-form Secret, he holds a deep hatred towards Eureka and is determined to seize the RA272 Nirvash as his own, and his hatred was passed towards Ao upon realizing he is Eureka's son and the true pilot of the IFO. As part of his plan, he manipulates Naru into siding with him and gives her the Nirvash Type Zero after it is seized by the Japanese military. Truth takes control of the Kanon an unknown LFO when invading Génération Bleu in episode 20. As a Secret, he is capable of killing people who are infected by Scub Corals.

In the final scene, he is shown to remain in his astral form, choosing to drift in time and space while Ao returned to his world. ; Amber is Renton and Eureka's daughter and Ao's older sister. She appears only once in the anime, although she was obscured in a blanket. During her pregnancy with their daughter, Eureka and Renton were warned that their child would be affected by high trapar concentrations due to being a human-Coralian hybrid, but they chose to carry the pregnancy to term rather than abortion. After her birth, Amber was implied to be healthy until her body turned to stone and she died as a result of the high trapar when she was 3 months old. Her death serves as the catalyst for Renton trying to destroy the Scub Coral and sending Eureka to the past of an alternative universe in order for Ao to survive in a world with less trapar. Although both Renton and Eureka continue to mourn their daughter's death, it is Renton that's most grief-stricken and he blames himself for her death. ;: Noah is an that is kept by Naru as her pet.

His surname may also refer to an essay by Maurice Maeterlinck from the collection titled Le Trésor des Humbles, the collection also being responsible for the name of the facility Eureka and the Nirvash were first studied at. *Matthieu's look and character is based on inspiration from Rob Machado, a well-known surfer who also likes to play with music. *Stoner may be based on Ron Stoner who, fitting with the theme of lifting, was a surf photographer. *Holland is constantly seen reading the book The Golden Bough by Sir James George Frazer, a comparative study of mythology and religion. *Anemone is named after an equally unbalanced young woman from the Ryu Murakami novel Coin Locker Babies. Murakami's Anemone also kept a pet named Gulliver (an alligator, in her case). *Charles and Ray Beams are named after Charles Eames and Ray Eames, two married designers (known for the film Powers of Ten). *The name Beams may have been chosen in reference to the Beams T company, which produces T-shirts by a wide variety of hip designers. To coincide with the show's broadcast, Beams T introduced a pair of shirts with Eureka Seven-based typographical logos by Tsuyoshi Kusano. *Renton's uncle is extremely similar in appearance to Jet Black, a character in Cowboy Bebop. He is also employed in law enforcement, which was Jet Black's former occupation at the start of the series.

It was developed by American studio Jumpin' Jack Software and published by Sega in 1995. The game centers around a member of a mining crew, with an artificial powered exoskeleton resembling a power-loader. The crew, specifically the protagonist, must fight off a once-friendly alien race known as the Ghen, who suddenly turn on the humans. Story The game takes place in the future, years after an armada of aliens known as the Ghen made contact with human beings. The Ghen are seeking refuge from a bloody inter-galactic war with a super race known as the Bo-Kyat. In exchange for their aid, human beings were given major advancements in science and technology, including bionic implant devices that make them immune to all disease. The Ghen also assist humans in locating materials on other planets through the creation of the Sunstar Solar Exploration Station. The exploration team, composed of humans led by a man named Jenners, and Ghen led by Commander Xylan, is harvesting minerals on Titan when the story begins. For reasons unknown, Xylan orders his Ghen to enter their spacecraft and take off. Boxhead, an android scientist, informs Jenner that there is \\"stronium\\" activity (a presumably fictional material, not to be confused with strontium) nearby. After hearing that the Ghen have left, Jenner orders everyone back to the ship, including the 'Lieutenant' (the protagonist), in his exoskeleton. The human team (including their pilot Gina and wise-cracking Akira) take off in their own ship, the Da Vinci, and try to make contact with the Sunstar station. The Ghen attack and destroy the station before turning their attention to the human ship. The humans manage to escape but soon begin a mission of disabling Ghen stronium reactors and thwarting their attacks, with the help of the Lieutenant and his exoskeleton. The Ghen subsequently blame the crew of the Da Vinci for destroying Sunstar and Titan and invading Mars, and use human figureheads under their control like Commander Braxton to try to trick them into returning to Earth for disciplinary action. The Da Vinci easily realize their deception and continue anyway, with Relay Commander Reynolds (their only contact due to the interstellar communications blackout) informing them that the starship Goliath is dry-docked on Moonbase 12. After returning from the Moon, they wire Boxhead into the ship's communication systems to send a transmission directly to Earth, only to find Reynolds has also fallen under Xylan's control. After Xylan's transmission is intercepted by Wilson, now leading an underground resistance against the Ghen, they discover the Ghen are using the implants to sedate everyone on Earth. They then head for the implant manufacturing plant in Australia to liberate the sedated humans. The game has multiple endings, but in the best ending, the player and the crew of the Da Vinci score a major victory against the Ghen. Unfortunately, the Ghen take a few hundred captive humans with them as they retreat from the Earth. The crew of the Da Vinci are hailed as heroes, and given medals and a Ghen ship capable of lightspeed. In prison, Xylan explains they were using humanity to test their only means of stopping the Bo-Kyat, which would have made them all slaves to the Ghen's war machines, but by blindingly clinging to the notions of freedom and independence, humanity has sealed its own doom. As the crewman questioning him and the player are left to wonder which of them will be proven right, the game ends with the crew excitedly taking off in their new ship. Gameplay Ghen War is a 3D first-person shooter that takes place from within a powered loader, equipped with various tools / weapons which it uses to fight off the Ghen. Most of the game's information and HUD are displayed along the roll-bar of the hyper-suit. The game features 20 levels in six different locations, including Venus, Mars, Deimos, and the moon. There are also two locations on Earth: Australia and NORAD. Among its guns and missiles, the hyper-suit has unique features such as a claw-manipulator and the ability to cast a decoy suit, which attracts enemy attention. Ghen War features an early example of deformable terrain. Firing weapons into a mountain causes the mountain to wear away, much like explosions would cause craters and similar effects. Audio and visuals The story of Ghen War is told through a series of cut-scenes, done mostly in full motion video. The soundtrack of the game was written by Brian Coburn, and it changes dynamically to meet the action taking place within the level.{http://cheats.ign.com/objects/001/001821.html} Reception Ghen War divided critics, who expressed contradicting opinions on most of the game's major aspects. While Andrew Baran, Mike LeFebvre, and Mike Desmond of Electronic Gaming Monthly said the gameplay consists of aimless wandering \\"with no goals or point\\", reviewers for Next Generation and Sega Saturn Magazine asserted that the varied mission objectives and automap give the gameplay greater direction than most games of its type. While GamePro, Next Generation, Game Revolution, and Andrew Baran and Sushi-X of EGM all said the visuals are both technically impressive and an enhancement to the gameplay experience with their contrasting landscapes, Mark LeFebvre of EGM and Rob Allsetter of Sega Saturn Magazine described them as both monotonous and unacceptably poor given the Saturn's capabilities. LeFebvre said the enemies have \\"no intelligence\\", but Next Generation contented that \\"the enemies are smart. Sure, you'll come across some that are more like targets than predators, but it's also not unusual to find an enemy sneaking around behind the crest of a hill in order to attack from some hidden corner.\\" Critics did generally agree that the game's complex controls can be difficult, but disagreed on whether this remains a problem after the initial learning curve is past. Critics were also divided in their overall assessments of Ghen War. Some concluded that its negative aspects completely outweighed its merits or at best made it a game that only a select few would have the patience needed to appreciate, while others felt that it offers enough enjoyment and sparks of originality to make it worth getting.

It is situated in the Boundary Ranges of the Coast Mountains and existed since the Late Pleistocene stage of the Pleistocene epoch, which began 130,000 years ago and ended 10,000 years ago. The mountain gets its name from the needle-like lava spines or hoodoos that reach heights of , which give the volcano a strange appearance. This appearance makes Hoodoo Mountain different from other neighbouring mountains in the Boundary Ranges. The volcano boasts an ice cap on its summit, and radar imaging of the rock beneath the ice has shown that the mountain's flat-topped summit is not just attributable to the ice cap, but the top of the mountain is flat as well. Beneath the summit ice cap lies an ice-filled volcanic crater that rises at an elevation of and a topographic prominence of . Except for minor irregularities caused by erosion, any contour line drawn is practically a circle. Hoodoo Mountain consists of a balanced lava dome in diameter and throughout most of its history, it has been influenced by glacial ice, causing several periods of subglacial eruptions and interactions between volcanic activity and ice sheets. This volcanic process has created Hoodoo's structure and stratigraphy similar to subglacial volcanoes. Geography and geology Map of the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Hoodoo Mountain lies on the southern axis of the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, a large line of volcanoes extending from the Alaska-Yukon border to a point near Prince Rupert, British Columbia. The region in turn is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, a seismically active region that encircles the Pacific Ocean and contains some of the world's most active volcanoes. The Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province is produced by continental rifting as the Pacific Plate slides northward along the Queen Charlotte Fault, on its way to the Aleutian Trench, which extends along the southern coastline of Alaska and the adjacent waters of northeastern Siberia off the coast of Kamchatka Peninsula. As the continental crust stretches, hot magma rises and the near-surface rocks fracture along steeply graduated cracks parallel to the rift known as faults. Like many other rift-related volcanoes, Hoodoo Mountain generates passive and occasionally explosive eruptions. Hoodoo Mountain is one of the three large compositionally diverse volcanoes of the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province along with the Mount Edziza volcanic complex and Level Mountain. The overall flat-topped topography of Hoodoo Mountain led Canadian volcanologist Jack Souther to refer Hoodoo Mountain as a tuya, which are flat-topped, steep- sided subglacial volcanoes formed when lava erupts through a thick glacier or ice sheet. However, Hoodoo Mountain does not fit the normal tuya model because of its complex layering of rocks, although Hoodoo's unusual structure obviously results from frequent interactions between volcanic activity and Pleistocene ice sheets over the past 100,000 years. Satellite image of Hoodoo Mountain. Glaciers are the Hoodoo and Twin glaciers, respectively. Hoodoo Mountain contains at least two sets of prominent cliffs, producing a discontinuous, step-like topographic profile. The base of Hoodoo Mountain is largely delimited by a series of cliffs that range from to high, while Hoodoo's southeastern flank is relatively gentle. Here, lava flows from the most recent volcanic activity cover earlier topography; the southeastern flank is smooth from around the summit to the Iskut River. The top of the lower cliff ring defines a broad bench with an elevation of about that terminates against an upper set of cliffs. The seconed set of vertical cliffs is between and high and surrounds the summit. A prominent dike, known as The Monument, rises more than in elevation on Hoodoo's southwestern flank and is the remnants of a volcanic vent surrounded by thick deposits of lava and breccia formed during subglacial eruptions. Hoodoo Mountain lies in an area of high elevation ecosystems colonizing very erodible substrate. The mountain is generally poorly forested due to its high altitude and remote alpine location. This mountainous terrain has made Hoodoo Mountain a site for alpine tundra. Even though alpine tundra lacks trees, Hoodoo's lower flanks contain mountain hemlock. Because alpine tundra is located in various widely separated regions on Earth, there is no animal species common to all areas of alpine tundra. Glaciers Map of the Hoodoo Mountain area, including the Hoodoo and Twin glaciers and Little Bear Mountain. The western, eastern and northern flanks of Hoodoo Mountain are covered by two valley glaciers known as the Hoodoo and Twin glaciers, while Hoodoo's southern flank, which extends down to the floodplain of the Iskut River, is free from glacial ice. Hoodoo Glacier on the volcano's western flank extends at the head of the Hoodoo River, while the Twin Glacier on Hoodoo's northern and eastern flanks lies at the headwaters of the Twin River. In the past, Hoodoo Mountain has been covered by glacial ice more than thick. The meltwater from the Hoodoo Glacier drains into the Hoodoo River while meltwater from the Twin Glacier drains into the Twin River. These two relatively small rivers are a source for the much larger Iskut River, flowing from the southern flank of Hoodoo Mountain respectively. Runoff from the Hoodoo and Twin glaciers and those on surrounding mountains is a source of fresh water for major salmon habitats and fisheries on the Iskut and Stikine rivers. Related features Lying just on the northern flank of Hoodoo Mountain is a small tuya known as Little Bear Mountain. This related Pleistocene age subglacial volcano consists of alkaline basalt and erupted mainly pyroclastic breccia with minor amounts of massive lava, pillow lava, volcanic sandstone and hyaloclastite. Cross-cutting veinlets of obsidian indicate these volcanics were formed by partial melting in the mantle beneath Little Bear Mountain. Mantle xenoliths found at Little Bear Mountain may have originated from mid-crustal depths. The relatively small size of Little Bear Mountain and its close connection with Hoodoo Mountain indicates it is a parasitic cone. Such geographical features are formed when the vent of the main volcanic edifice (i.e. Hoodoo Mountain) is blocked by cooled and solidified lava, forcing magma to intrude into the lines of weakness at the side of the main volcanic edifice under pressure. Eruptive history Eruption styles that may have produced the three different types of ice- contact deposits at Hoodoo Mountain. Hoodoo Mountain is a well-exposed example of peralkaline, phonolitic ice-contact and subglacial volcanism. Studies have shown that a cycle occurs about every 24,000 years, after which activity shifts from subglacial to post-glacial eruptions and then back to subglacial again. This cyclical activity is unique to Hoodoo Mountain among the Northern Cordilleran volcanoes. Three cycles have been clearly identified, including one subglacial eruption and two post-glacial eruptions. Records show that from 85,000 to 80,000 years ago, activity was more intense than it is today. More than 90% of Hoodoo Mountain, which dates back to at least 100,000 years, formed during its early eruptive history and has grown steadily since then. Regional ice thickness during some of Hoodoo Mountain's subglacial eruptions might have been more than in thickness. The main volcanics at Hoodoo Mountain are phonolite and comendic trachyte lavas and hyaloclastites, although some pyroclastic rocks also exist. The trachyte and comendic magmas erupted from Hoodoo Mountain and other Northern Cordilleran volcanoes are thought to have been created by fractionation of primary alkali basaltic magma in crustal reservoirs. The estimated volume of erupted material from Hoodoo Mountain is , and at least six phases of eruptive activity are recognized at the volcano. The first phase of eruptive activity occurred 85,000 years ago in the Late Pleistocene stage of the Pleistocene epoch, producing lava flows, lava domes, and breccia deposits. These volcanics were erupted under more than of glacial ice to produce subglacial eruptions. Hoodoo Glacier and lava flows on the flanks of Hoodoo Mountain. During the second eruptive phase 80,000 years ago, eruptions were no longer subglacial, but the volcano was surrounded by ice at least thick. Lava flows during this eruptive phase melted some of the thick glacial ice and ponded around the perimeters of Hoodoo Mountain, which quickly solidified to form a barrier behind which more lava piled up. Such ice- marginal lava flows are anomalously thick and are normally bounded by steep cliffs with fine-scale cooling joints and much volcanic glass. These ice- marginal lava flows form the massive lava cliffs near the base of Hoodoo Mountain and are among Hoodoo's most prominent features. The third eruptive phase between 80 and 54 thousand years ago was followed by explosive activity that produced pyroclastic flows down the northern and western flanks of the mountain to create welded and unwelded ignimbrite deposits up to thick. This explosive activity is one of the few explosive eruptions throughout Hoodoo Mountain's eruptive history, and could have been caused by magma breaching thinner ice. During the fourth phase of eruptive activity 54,000 years ago, eruptions were again no longer subglacial. Lava flows from this phase of activity overlie pyroclastic deposits from the third phase of activity and ice-dammed lava from the second phase of activity. Between 54 and 30 thousand years ago, the fifth phase of eruptive activity occurred subglacially and produced two distinct types of lava-breccia associations. The first subglacial eruption between 54 and 40 thousand years ago produced lava domes and monomict breccia, while the other subglacial eruption between 40 and 30 thousand years ago took place under thinner glacial ice. The final phase of eruptive activity was effusive in nature with no explosive activity (VEI-0). This effusive volcanism produced lava flows with well-preserved lava channels on the northwest and southwest flanks of Hoodoo Mountain in the early Holocene epoch and are largely unglaciated, suggesting the final eruptive phase occurred in an ice-free environment. These lava flows originated from the mountain's flat- topped summit and volcanic vents on its flanks. Geologists do not always agree on the dates of these more recent eruptions, some dating them to nine thousand years ago, others to as recently as seven thousand years ago. Southern flank of Hoodoo Mountain. Recent activity Hoodoo Mountain is one of the eleven Canadian volcanoes associated with recent seismic activity: the others are Mount Garibaldi, Castle Rock, Mount Cayley massif, The Volcano, Crow Lagoon, Silverthrone Caldera, the Mount Meager massif, the Mount Edziza volcanic complex, Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Nazko Cone. Seismic data suggests that these volcanoes still contain living magma chambers, indicating possible future eruptive activity. Although the available data does not produce a clear conclusion, these observations are further indications that some of Canada's volcanoes are potentially active, and that their associated hazards may be significant. The seismic activity correlates both with some of Canada's most youthful volcanoes, and with long-lived volcanoes with a history of significant explosive activity, such as Hoodoo Mountain. Current threats and preparedness Topographic map of Hoodoo Mountain's summit ice cap. The volcano continues to pose a serious threat to the surrounding area. In 1997, a group of university and industry scientists associated with the Geological Survey of Canada spent six weeks camping at the edge of Hoodoo's summit ice cap to determine the volume of water on the volcano's summit which could be mobilized in the event of an eruption using ice-penetrating radar. This group included Mark Stasiuk and Catherine Hickson of the Geological Survey of Canada, Alison Rust, Kelly Russell and Ben Edwards of the University of British Columbia, Trevor Page of Lancaster University, Guy Cross and Jeff Schmok of Golder Associates and Jim Nicholls of the University of Calgary. Hoodoo's summit ice cap remains thick and in diameter and throughout the volcano's history, it has been influenced by glacial ice. Most of the volcano's volcanic activity has produced lava flows from its flat-topped summit, indicating any potential volcanism will occur under the summit ice cap to trigger considerable melting, flooding and mudflows, which could have a disastrous effect on the adjacent Iskut and Stikine rivers. Although very few people live in the region, large mining and mineral exploration camps exist south of Hoodoo Mountain on the Iskut River. Should there be renewed activity in the form of lava flows, damming of the Iskut River would be a significant hazard to these mining and mineral operations. In the 1980s, the Iskut River was studied as a possible site for a hydroelectric plan. However, the plain was left alone partly because of the uncertain volcanic potential in the surrounding environment. High columns of volcanic ash associated with explosive eruptions would have more widespread effects, including disruption of air traffic between Canada, Alaska, and Asia. However, this is a less possibility because most eruptions at Hoodoo Mountain are lava flows. The Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan, Canada's volcanic emergency notification program, was established to outline the notification procedure to some of the main agencies that would be involved in response to a volcanic eruption in Canada, an eruption close to Canada's borders, or an eruption significant enough to have an effect on Canada and its people. It focuses primarily on aviation safety because air traffic can quickly enter areas of volcanic ash. The program notifies all impacted agencies that have to deal with volcanic events. Aircraft are rerouted away from hazardous ash and people on the ground are notified of potential ash fall. Monitoring Currently Hoodoo Mountain is not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active the volcano's magma chamber is. The existing network of seismographs has been established to monitor tectonic earthquakes and is too far away to provide a good indication of what is happening beneath the mountain. It may sense an increase in activity if the volcano becomes very restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption. It might detect activity only once the volcano has started erupting.

W. & A. K. Johnston Limited. Edinburgh and London. 1886. Page 3. History Etymology The name is said to derive from Macauselan (meaning son of Anselan). The following two names are given as the root of the territorial name Buchanan, Mac a Chanonaich (The Son of the Canon) and Buth Chanain (meaning house or seat of the canon). 11th-13th centuries and origins Traditionally, Clan Buchanan can trace its chiefly line back to Anselan O Kyan who was of the clan Ó Catháin, provincial king of north Ulster (and had his seat in Limavady, Co. Londonderry) who landed in Argyll in 1016.Robert Bain. 1938. The Clans and Tartans of Scotland. Glasgow and London: Fontana/Collins. p. 50. For his services against the Danes he is traditionally said to have received the lands of Buchanan from king Malcolm II which lie to the east of Loch Lomond around the village of Killearn.Bain, loc. cit. However, the traditional account is inconsistent with other accounts for the period in Ireland, and may be little more than an origin myth.Buchanan, Watson W. (2002) 'History of Clan Buchanan and its Septs: a Millennial Update' Pro Familia Publishing, Toronto, Canada, p 7f During the reign of Malduin, Mormaer (Earl) of Lennox, 1217–1250, Anselan (third of that name) was granted, in 1225, the island of Clareinch.National Archive of Scotland, RH1/2/40 (Clár Inis). He is referred to as 'clericus meus', meaning 'my clergyman'. He is subsequently recorded as Absalom de Buchanan and it is understood that to have this title, there must have been other grants of land in the parish of Buchanan. During the reign of king Alexander II (1214–1249), Gilbert de Buchanan, seneschal to the Earl of Lennox, received, in 1231, a charter confirming Clareinch and other lands in Buchanan. It is from the lands of Buchanan that the Clan name is derived. 14th century and Wars of Scottish Independence Unenviable William Wallace Link. Sir Maurice Buchanan 10th of Buchanan married Margaret Menteth (also spelt Menteith). Margaret was the daughter of Sir Walter Menteth of Rusky, and granddaughter of Sir John of Menteth, Sheriff of Dunbarton Castle, and Helena daughter of Gartnait, Earl of Mar. Sir John is reputed to have betrayed Sir William Wallace to king Edward I of England on 5 Aug 1305. Sir John was imprisoned by king Robert I but in 1314 \\"through influence of his sons-in-law; Malice, Earl of Strathern; Sir Archibald Campbell, of Lochow; and Maurice Buchanan, of Buchanan, he was released immediately before the Battle of Bannockburn, where he deported himself valiantly on the part of the Scottish king.\\"Burke, John (1833) ‘A General and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire, Volume 1’, 4th Ed, Published for Henry Colburn, London, p 318 Sir John was also a signatory to the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320. During the Wars of Scottish Independence the Clan Buchanan supported King Robert the Bruce by aiding his escape in 1306, the chief, Maurice 10th of Buchanan, refused to sign the Ragman Roll, and the chief and lairds of the clan (and presumably their clansmen) served under Malcolm the Earl of Lennox. It is tradition and likely given the aforementioned service, but ill-documented, that the clan fought at the Battle of Bannockburn. During the reign of king David II (1324–1371), undated, at least part of the lands of Buchanan belonged to Sir Gilbert Carrick.Robertson’s Index for Charters of Sovereigns of Scotland, cited in Nimo, William (1817) History of Stirlingshire. Corrected and brought down to the present time by W.M. Stirling, 2nd.

It is said that Sir Alexander Buchanan came face to face with the Duke of Clarence and, escaping his thrust, pierced the Duke through the left eye, killing him. Sir Alexander Buchanan however was later killed leading the clan against the English at the Battle of Verneuil in 1424. The 15th century is a watershed in the evolution of Buchanan heraldry. In the Armorial de Barry, c 1445Partially reproduced in Clouston, J. Storer, 'The Armorial of Berry' Proceedings of the Society of Antiquarians of Scotland, Vol. LXXII, 6th series, Vol XII (1938) pages 84-111 the arms of Buchanan (Le sire de bouguenal) are Or (gold/yellow), chevron checky of Azure (Blue) and Argent (silver/white), and the three boars heads erased and erect of Gules (red). The following three events are believed to have resulted in a total transformation in the Chief's arms: 1421 - The Battle of Baugé in which Sir Alexander Buchanan (son of the Chief) killed the Duke of Clarence (second son of King Henry IV of England). 1425 – Execution by James I of Scotland, of his first-cousin, Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany, and Murdoch's two older sons for treason. 1443 – Marriage of Isobel Stewart (daughter of Murdoch Stewart) to Sir Walter Buchanan. The arms described in the Scots Roll, c1455, 'Or, a lion rampant Sable goutty Or within a double tressure flory counter-flory Sable', contain many of the elements of the arms registered by John Buchanan in 1657, the coat of arms we recognise today. The adoption of the double tressure flory counterflory into the Chief's arms alludes to the nearness of the Buchanan chiefly line to that of the Scottish royal line by the marriage of Isobel Stewart. The Chief's 1657 crest (which also is the centre piece of clanfolk's badge) is a hand couped at the wrist holding a ducal cap, which celebrates Sir Alexander Buchanan's slaying of the Duke of Clarence in combat. However, the seal of George Buchanan c1557, 'Three (bear or boar) heads erased', is similar to the 1445 arms. In the 15th century a feud broke out between the Buchanan's of Leny\\"The Highland Clans of Scotland\\" by George Eyre-Todd 1923. and the Clan MacLaren resulting in a full- scale battle. On the day of a fair where the Clan MacLaren were busy buying, selling and enjoying themselves word came that the Clan Buchanan were marching up towards them through Strathyre. There was no time to lose and the Clan MacLaren rushed to arms. The MacLarens had not all come in by the time the Buchanans arrived, however they were not daunted and attacked the Buchanans. At first the Buchanans were faring better and drove the MacLarens back. The Chief of MacLarens saw one of his sons cut down and being suddenly seized with battle madness turned and shouted the famous MacLaren battle cry \\"Creag An Tuirc\\" and whirling his Claymore rushed furiously at the enemy. His clansmen followed him and the Buchanans were cut down like corn. Only two escaped by swimming the River Balvaig but even they were followed. One was cut down at Gartnafuaran and the second was cut down at a place since known by the circumstance as Sron Laine. In 1497 Kenneth Mackenzie, 8th of Kintail, chief of Clan Mackenzie was killed by the Laird of Buchanan.\\"A History of the Clan Mackenzie\\" by Alexander MacKenzie. 16th century, Anglo-Scottish Wars and the King of Kippen During the Anglo-Scottish Wars the Clan Buchanan fought against the English at the Battle of Flodden in 1513 where the chief's elder son Patrick was killed. However Patrick had already married a daughter of the Earl of Argyll and had two sons and daughters. Later the Clan Buchanan fought against the English at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547. John Buchanan, the second son of Walter Buchanan the 14th of Buchanan and uncle of George Buchanan the 15th of Buchanan, became proprietor of Arnprior, and afterwards the noted \\"King of Kippen\\", a phrase which originated in a whimsical episode between himself and James V. The story is well retold by Sir Walter Scott in the following paragraph. > When James V travelled in disguise he used a name which was known only to > some of his principal nobility and attendants. He was called the Goodman > (the tenant, that is) of Ballengiech. Ballengiech is a steep pass which > leads down behind the Castle of Stirling. Once upon a time when he was > feasting in Stirling, the King sent for some venison from the neighbouring > hills. The deer were killed and put on horse’s backs, to be transported to > Stirling. Unluckily they had to pass the castle gates of Arnpryor, belonging > to a chief of the Buchanans, who had a considerable number of guests with > him.

The chief, seeing so much fat venison > passing his very door, seized on it; and to the expostulations of the > keepers, who told him it belonged to King James, he answered insolently, > that if James was King in Scotland, he, Buchanan, was King in Kippen, being > the name of the district in which the Castle of Arnpryor lay. On hearing > what had happened, the King got on horseback, and rode instantly from > Stirling to Buchanan's house, where he found a strong fierce looking > Highlander, with an axe on his shoulder, standing sentinel at the door.

As soon as Buchanan heard these words, he > knew that the King was there in person, and hastened down to kneel at > James's feet, and to ask forgiveness for his insolent behaviour. But the > King, who only meant to give him a fright, forgave him freely, and going > into the castle feasted on his own venison which Buchanan had intercepted. > Buchanan of Arnpryor was ever afterwards called the King of Kippen. 17th century, Wars of the Three Kingdoms and loss of the Buchanan Estate During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms Sir George Buchanan commanded the Stirlingshire Regiment and led the clan at the Battle of Dunbar (1650) on the side of the Scottish Covenanters. He later led the clan at the Battle of Inverkeithing but here he was captured and died in captivity later the same year. It is claimed that in Buchanan's Stirlingshire Regiment \\"most of his officers, and a good many of the soldiers\\" were of the name Buchanan, and that at the Battle of Inverkeithing a \\"vast number of the name Buchanan\\" died. Other Buchanans involved with the Royalist cause include: # David Buchanan, Royalist soldier captured at Worchester. Transported on the John and Sarah, from Gravesend 13 May 1652 to Boston.Dobson, David (1983). Directory of Scots Banished to the American Plantations: 1650–1775. Genealogical Publishing Com. p 18 # John Buchanan, Royalist soldier captured at Worchester. Transported on the John and Sarah, from Gravesend 13 May 1652 to Boston.Dobson (1983). p 18 Some Buchanans fought on the side of the Covenanters at the Battle of Bothwell Brig in 1679. One was George Buchanan (1657–1719) (later a magistrate, maltman (whisky distiller) and successful Glasgow merchant), the son of Andrew Buchanan of Gartacharne (a small farm () 2 km due south-east of Drymen). George was the father of four of Glasgow's most distinguished citizens: George Buchanan of Moss and Auchentoshan (maltman and Glasgow city treasurer and bailie), Andrew Buchanan of Drumpellier (Tobacco Lord and Lord Provost of Glasgow), Archibald Buchanan of Silverbanks and Auchentortie (Tobacco Lord) and Neil Buchanan of Hillington (Tobacco Lord and Member of Parliament for Glasgow district of burghs).Buchanan, Arthur William Patrick (1929) \\"Later Leaves of the Buchanan Book,\\" p223, E.

The full scope of Buchanan Covenanters is unknown; however, # Alexander Buchanan, Buchlivie, Covenanter, was sent from Tollbooth, 12 Dec 1678, on St. Michael of Scarborough, to Themes for on forwarding to the American plantations.Dobson (1983). p 17 # Andrew Buchanan, Shirgarton, Covenanter, was sent from Tollbooth, 12 Dec 1678, on St. Michael of Scarborough, to Themes for on forwarding to the American plantations. # Gilbert Buchanan, Glasgow, banished to the Indies, 13 Jun 1678. A romantic depiction of a clan Duine Uasal (pronounced Dunnie-wassal) illustrated by R. R. McIan, from James Logan's The Clans of the Scottish Highlands, 1845. Regarding the Buchanan Estate (c1681), according to William Buchanan of Auchmar, \\"The most flourishing condition it has been in, for diverse ages, was upon the last laird's accession to it\\" (c1652). (By last laird, he was referring to John Buchanan, son of Sir George Buchanan.) At this time the estate included the Barony of Buchanan, \\"several lands in the parishes of Killearn, Strablane, and others in Lennox\\" (Strablane is likely to be Strathblane which is between the parishes of Killearn and Lennox); \\"the whole estate of Badindalloch\\" (in Stirlingshire); and \\"the estate of Craigmillar in Midlothian\\". Along with the inheritance of the estate and clan chiefship, there was significant debt. John Buchanan was unwilling to receive his inheritance until his brother-in-law to be, David Erskine, 2nd Lord Cardross, arranged for creditors to accept as payment only a portion of what was owed (a composition). Debt continued to plague John Buchanan, and in about 1680, he and his named successor, Major George Grant (alias Major George Buchanan of that Ilk), sold some of the Highland lands to James Grahame, the Third Marquess of Montrose. It appears that there were other claimants to the Highland lands and as a guarantee that the sale would proceed, John Buchanan offered the Barony of Buchanan as security (an infeftment of real warrandice). It transpired that the sale did not proceed and the Marquess of Montrose became the owner of the Barony of Buchanan and it became the seat of Clan Graham. Prior to the sale, John Buchanan of Arnpryor had been the estate manager for John Buchanan. After the sale, John Buchanan of Arnpryor received a quarter of the estate from the Marquess of Montrose for his services and assistance in evicting the whole estate. (Precisely what his services were and the meaning of \\"evicting the whole estate\\" is unclear.) 18th century and Jacobite uprisings As a unified entity, Clan Buchanan took no part in the Jacobite uprisings of 1715 to 1716 or the 1745 to 1746 uprising. A likely contributing factor was the leadership vacuum resulting from the death of the last Chief in c1681. There is clear evidence of some Buchanans supporting the Jacobite cause (including the reintroduction of the absolute monarchy of the Stuarts) while others were supporting the Government cause (including the continuance of the limited monarchy of the Hanoverians: limited by law and Parliament).

Moore, Philadelphia Clan Chiefs Title of the Chief. The two main Clan historians, Buchanan of Auchmar writing in 1723 uses the term ‘Laird of Buchanan’, while Guthrie Smith writing in 1896 uses the term ‘Laird of Buchanan’ to describe the chiefs up to and including Sir Maurice the 10th of Buchanan and then ‘Buchanan of that Ilk’ up to and including Sir George the 15th of Buchanan and thereafter Buchanan of Buchanan. The chief of a Highland clan could be referred to as the ‘Laird of’, meaning the head of the clan (a patrimonial title), e.g. Laird of Buchanan. The title ‘of that Ilk’ was historically used by both Highland and Lowland clans to indicate head or chiefship (again a patrimonial title), e.g. Buchanan of that Ilk. However, in the early 19th century ‘of that Ilk’ fell out of favour with Highland chiefs who adopted a duplication of the patronymic, regardless of ownership of territory or estate, e.g. Buchanan of Buchanan. Given the current Highland practice, Buchanan of Buchanan is likely to be the preferred contemporary title but for ease of reading and clarity, n th of Buchanan is used in the following paragraphs. Both the spelling Buchanan and Buchannan are used interchangeably in historical documents. The Chiefs The first six Clan Chiefs are poorly represented in historical records and are included by some Clan historians and omitted by others. Buchanan of Auchmar and Guthrie Smith commence their respective numbering of Chiefs at a different person, and describe a different order and number of Chiefs following Sir Walter 11th of Buchanan. In part this is due to the heir apparent not succeeding to the chiefship before he dies and chiefship passing directly from grandfather to grandchild. The following lineage reconciles Guthrie Smith and Buchanan of Auchmar and their respective numbering is in parenthesis. Succession of Clan Buchanan Chiefs 1st – Anselan O'Kyan, son of a petty king from Ulster, Ireland, in the service of Malcolm II of Scotland from whom he received a grant of land in Lennox. He married an heiress of Denniestoun and by her had a son, John. 2nd – John, whose son and successor was Anselan. 3rd – Anselan, whose son and successor was Walter. 4th – Walter, whose son and successor was Girald. 5th – Girald also called Bernard, whose son and successor was McBeath. 6th –McBeath (MacBethe/McBeth) McCausland, whose son and successor was Anselan. 7th – Anselan McCausland, (Guthrie Smith identifies him as the 7th Laird of Buchanan and commences his numbering of Chiefs from him.) Seneschal to Earl of Lennox in about 1225 and obtained the charter for the Loch Lomond island of Clareinch (the Clan's call to war and alternately rendered as Clairinch or Clar Innis), had three sons (Gilbert his successor, Methlin the ancestor of the MacMillans, and Coleman the ancestor of the MacColemans). 8th – Gilbert Buchanan, (Guthrie Smith identifies him as 2nd Chief and Buchanan of Auchmar identifies him as 8th Chief) whose son and successor was Maurice. 9th – Sir Maurice Buchanan, (Guthrie Smith identifies him as 3rd Chief and Buchanan of Auchmar identifies him as 9th Chief) had three sons (Maurice his successor, Allan who married the heiress of Leny and John the first ancestor of the cadets of Auchneiven). 10th – Sir Maurice Buchanan, (Guthrie Smith identifies him as 4th Chief and Buchanan of Auchmar identifies him as 10th Chief) lived to a considerable age, married the daughter of Sir William Menteith of Rusk and by her a son and successor (Walter). 11th – Sir Walter Buchanan, (Guthrie Smith identifies him as 5th Chief and Buchanan of Auchmar identifies him as 11th Chief) married Margaret and had three sons (Walter his successor, Alexander who reputedly killed the Duke of Clarence at the battle of Beaugé in 1421 and who later died in the battle of Verneuil in 1424, and John [Buchanan of Auchmar identifies him as 12th Chief ] who married Janet the heiress of Leny and was the first ancestor of the cadets of Leny) and two daughters (Elizabeth and Jean). 12th – Sir Walter Buchanan, (Guthrie Smith identifies him as 6th Chief and Buchanan of Auchmar identifies him as 13th Chief) first married an unidentified women and by her three sons (Patrick his successor and Walter Drumikill and Carbeth) and one daughter. He married secondly to Isobel Stewart. 13th – Patrick Buchanan, (Guthrie Smith identifies him as 7th Chief and Buchanan of Auchmar identifies him as 14th Chief) married Jonet Cunningham of Galbraith and by her a son (Walter his successor) and a daughter (Anabella). He also had an illegitimate son (Patrick). 14th – Walter Buchanan, (Guthrie Smith identifies him as 8th Chief and Buchanan of Auchmar identifies him as 15th Chief) married Isobel Graham and by her four sons (Patrick [Guthrie Smith identifies him as 9th Chief but then goes on to advise that the Chiefship passed from Patrick's father to Patrick's son and Buchanan of Auchmar identifies him as 16th Chief ] who married the daughter of the Earl of Argyle and by her had George who succeeded his grandfather; John first ancestor of cadets of Arnprior; Maurice; and Walter first ancestor of cadets of Spittal) and two daughters (Margaret and Elizabeth). 15th – George Buchanan, (Guthrie Smith identifies him as 10th Chief and Buchanan of Auchmar identifies him as 17th Chief) succeed his grandfather, Walter 14th of Buchanan, in 1526 and died 1560. He first married Margaret Edmonstone and by her a son (John [Guthrie Smith identifies him as 11th Chief but then goes on to advise that the Chiefship passed from John's father to John's son and Buchanan of Auchmar identifies him as 18th Chief who married Elizabeth Livingston and by her had George who succeeded his grandfather) and two daughters (Helen and Susanna). Second he married Janet Cunningham and by her had a son (William first ancestor of the cadets of Auchmar) and a daughter (Margaret). 16th – Sir George Buchanan, (Guthrie Smith identifies him as 12th Chief and Buchanan of Auchmar identifies him as 19th Chief) succeed his grandfather, George 15th of Buchanan, in 1561, married Lady Mary Graham and by her one son (John his successor) and two daughters (Helen and Susanna). 17th – Sir John Buchanan, (Guthrie Smith identifies him as 13th Chief and Buchanan of Auchmar identifies him as 20th Chief) known for his frequent travels to foreign nations and other extravagances put the estate into much debt, married Annabel Erskin and by her two sons (George his successor and Walter). 18th – Sir George Buchanan, (Guthrie Smith identifies him as 14th Chief and Buchanan of Auchmar identifies him as 21st Chief) married Elizabeth Preston and by her a son (John his successor) and three daughters (Helen, Agnes and Jean). Sir George commanded the Stirlingshire Regiment in the Civil Wars of Charles I, fought at the battle of Dunbar, and was taken prisoner at Inverkeithing. He died in prison in 1651. 19th – John Buchanan,Description of arms: Or, a lion rampant Sable, armed and langued Gules, within a double tressure flory counterflory of the Second. Smibert, Thomas (1850). The clans of the Highlands of Scotland: an account of their annals, with delineations of their tartans, and family arms. Edinburgh: James Hogg. p. 44. (Guthrie Smith identifies him as 15th Chief and Buchanan of Auchmar identifies him as 22nd Chief) married in 1653 Mary Erskine and by her a daughter (Elizabeth). After the death of Mary, he married in 1677 Jean Pringle and by her had a daughter (Janet). When he died in 1682, he left no male heirs.Buchanan of Auchmar cites Dec 1682, Guthrie Smith cites before 6 September 1681, and National Archives of Scotland have a legal document prepared for John Buchanan's signature dated 28 August 1680 but it is unsigned, and a separated document of the same date is signed by George Buchanan of that Ilk. It would appear that John Buchanan died some close to and prior to 28 August 1680. He made two attempts to pass the chiefship to suitable candidates by arranging their marriage to his oldest daughter (Elizabeth). Firstly to Robert Buchanan, Advocate (the son of John Buchanan of Arnprior), and secondly to Major George Grant (details in a following section). In both cases, Elizabeth refused these arranged marriages. Consequently, no arrangement was finalised by which chiefship could be passed on to the descendants of his daughter. He inherited significant debt and during his chiefship, significant parts of the Buchanan Estate were sold, and the final portions of it were lost due to defaulting on creditors. With the lack of male heirs, the direct chiefly line ended at this time. Current Clan Chief A petition to claim the chiefship of Clan Buchanan was lodged with the Court of the Lord Lyon in December 2016 and in August 2018 the Lord Lyon allowed the petition thus recognising John Michael Baillie-Hamilton Buchanan as the chief of Clan Buchanan. After a gap of 337 years, the clan now has a recognised chief. The Lord Lyon was satisfied that the petitioner: *is the senior representative of the cadet branch of the chiefly line known as Buchanan of Leny, and that the remaining cadet branches of the chiefly line; namely Buchanan of Auchmar and Buchanan of Spittall, are extinct in law and in fact. (Descendants of Thomas Buchanan of Gartencaber were excluded from consideration because the C15th documents that purport to link him to the chiefly line were demonstrated to be forgeries.) *has association with the chiefly lands of Strathyre and that these were conferred on him in an unbroken chain of inheritance. In circumstances like this, the \\"Jeffery\\" Principle can be applied. Chiefs’ Burial Ground The reputed burial ground of the chiefs of Clan Buchanan is in the grounds of the Old Buchanan Parish Church . This church, the Chapel of St Mary & St Michael, served as a parish church after the abandonment of Inchcailleach in 1621 until a new church, in Milton of Buchanan, was built about 1764. Nothing now remains of the original chapel. Other people with some measure of recognition as chief The following four people have been cited as chief of Clan Buchanan but none appears to have been formally recognised by the Court of the Lord Lyon (the heraldry court of Scotland). Before addressing the claims to chiefship it is necessary to establish how the office and title of chief is passed to succeeding generations in Scotland. Patrilineal Descent. Firstly, the office and title is usually passed patrilineally (from father to child) in descending order of male birth then descending order of female birth, hence the oldest surviving son is the heir presumptive. If the heir presumptive produces no heirs, then on the heir presumptive's death the office and title goes to the next younger son, etc., then eldest daughter, etc. The term ‘cadet’ is used to describe family groups which are descendants of younger sons, thus the oldest surviving son of each generation maintains the main or principal family line, and younger sons establish cadet lines. In the case of the chiefly line of Buchanan, the first recognised cadet was Buchanan of Auchneiven and the last was Buchanan of Auchmar. Cadets can have their own cadets, e.g. Buchanans of Drumpellier, Auchintorlie, Craigend and Hillington are cadets of Buchanan of Leny through Gartacharne. When chiefly line is extinguished, the most recent cadet line to branch off the chiefly line becomes the new chiefly line. Maintenance of Surname. Secondly the office and title is implicitly linked to the surname, thus a McKay, a Cairns, etc. cannot be chief of Clan Buchanan. In some cases, where the heir is a daughter, arrangements have been made so that her husband and children assume her surname, and thus the office and title can be passed to her offspring. This practice has given rise to the use of compound (hyphenated or ‘double-barrelled’) names. The matter of principal names was established by the Lord Lyon Innes of Learney when in the case of Monro-Lucas-Tooth that he was a Tooth rather than a Monro or Lucas. It is now clearly established that it is the last name which decides the matter.See Reports of cases decide in the Court of the Lord Lyon, Scots Law Times 1965 Thus by the Court of the Lord Lyon, a Moodie-Buchanan is consider a Buchanan but a Buchanan-Moodie is considered a Moodie. Further, in the case of a chief as the representer of the family, the surname cannot be a compound surname. Major George Buchanan (alias Major George Grant) Neither Guthrie Smith nor Buchanan of Auchmar identify him as a chief (hence why John Buchanan is the last recognised chief); however, Buchanan of Auchmar advises that John Buchanan transferred \\"his estate to an old comrade of his, Major George Grant, Governor of Dumbarton castle, with this provision, that the Major should marry his eldest daughter, and assume the name and arms of Buchanan; reserving his own life-rent and his lady's jointure, and settling the estate so as to return to Buchanan's heirs-male, and, failing heirs of Grant's own body, to Buchanan's heirs whatsoever .\\" Despite George Grant never marrying the daughter of John Buchanan, National Archives of Scotland (NAS) records show the legal paperwork for this transfer occurred on 9 Apr 1679. NAS records show that by late 1679, George Grant had assumed the name George Buchanan, and that by 28 Aug 1680 he was cited as being Major George Buchanan of that Ilk. (The use of the title, Buchanan of that Ilk, implies that George had taken over the chiefship but it might also imply that John Buchanan was deceased by 28 Aug 1680.) Major George Buchanan never married and by his death had \\"given up all Buchanan evidences, both the rights and the fortune.\\" Buchanan of Arnprior right Sir Walter Scott in 1830, cites Francis Buchanan of Arnpryor (alternate spelling: Arnprior), who was executed at Carlisle on 18 Oct 1746 for high treason for his role in the Jacobite uprising, as being the chief of the family Buchanan.Scott, Sir Walter (1830) ‘‘Tales of a grandfather; being stories taken from Scottish history‘‘, 3rd Series, p 324, Cadell and Co., Edinburgh Jesse (1846),John Heneage Jesse, The Pretenders and Their Adherents: Memoirs of the Chevalier, Prince Charles Edward, and Their Adherents, Volume 2, 1864, p259, Richard Bentley, London Fillan (1849),A D. Fillan, Stories, traditionary and romantic, of the two rebellions in Scotland in 1715 and 1745, 1849, p265, Richard Bentley, London The Scottish Antiquary (1890)Hallen, A.W. Cornelius (Ed) (1890) ‘‘The Scottish Antiquary; or The Northern Notes and Queries‘‘ Vol V, June 1890, p 27. and a history of Clan MacNab (1899)Frazer, Alexander (1899) ‘‘Last Laird of MacNab‘‘, p 2, Imrie, Graham and Co. cites Francis Buchanan of Arnprior as being the Chief of Clan Buchanan. Francis Buchanan of Arnprior was the grandson of the John Buchanan of ArnpriorBuchanan of Auchmar p 79. who was the manager of the estate of John Buchanan of Buchanan (the last recognised Clan Chief who died c1681). Prior to the Chief's second marriage (1677), he had arranged for Elizabeth, the only child of his first marriage, to wed Robert Buchanan, son of John Buchanan of Arnprior, and in due course inherit the Buchanan estate and chiefship – a bond of Tailzie. This marriage did not take place and the arrangement was cancelled.National Archives of Scotland GD220/1/E/3/36 Revocation of bond of tailzi. Francis Buchanan of Arnprior married Elizabeth Buchanan, who was the daughter of Janet Buchanan, who was the second daughter of John Buchanan of Buchanan, i.e. Elizabeth was the granddaughter of John Buchanan of Buchanan (the only child of the Chief's second marriage). The Clan historian, William Buchanan of Auchmar, a contemporary of Francis Buchanan of Arnprior, notes that Francis Buchanan owned part of the old Buchanan lands but makes no reference to the supposed chiefship and, if anything, alludes to treachery to John Buchanan of Buchanan by John Buchanan of Arnprior (Francis Buchanan's grandfather). William Buchanan of Auchmar also makes no mention of Francis Buchanan having married the last chief's granddaughter. It is possible that Scott, a historical novelist, simply embellished the facts for literary purposes. Nevertheless, assuming that Scott, et al. are right and the chiefship had passed to Francis Buchanan (possibly via marriage to the heir of the last chief), then Buchanan of Auchmar may have misrepresented the Buchanans of Arnprior to bolster his own claim to the chiefship. Buchanan of Auchmar claim Alexander Nisbet in A System of Heraldry Vol 1, 1722, states that 'Buchannan of Lenie' is now the representor of 'Buchannan of that Ilk.' William Buchanan of Auchmar in his history of the clan, published in 1723, details a case that all cadet lines, except one, from George 15th of Buchanan to John Buchanan 19th of Buchanan had expired and on the death of the latter, the chiefship devolved to the cadet line most recently separated from the chiefly line, Buchanan of Auchmar, thus he, William Buchanan of Auchmar, is the chief of Clan Buchanan and that Nisbet is wrong in asserting that Buchanan of Leny is representer of the chiefly line. In Nisbet's (posthumously published) A System of Heraldry Vol 2, 1742, he recognises Buchanan of Auchmar as the successor of the chiefly line. In the 1826 claim for the chiefship by Dr Francis Buchanan-Hamilton, the extinction of both the main chiefly line and the Auchmar line are identified as preconditions to the claim. The later Clan historian, John Guthrie Smith, omits any reference to Buchanan of Auchmar's claim when he details the Buchanans of Auchmar. William Buchanan. William Buchanan of Auchmar married in 1696 Jean Buchanan and by her three son (John and Bernard who died before their father, and Alexander his successor) and three daughters (Janet, Katherine and Helen) who survived infancy. William died in 1747. Alexander Buchanan. Alexander Buchanan of Auchmar married Christine Campbell and by her two sons (William his successor and James who succeeded his brother). William Buchanan. William Buchanan of Auchmar sold his estate, reserving a right for redemption, he married in 1796 Sarah Bartlet. He died at sea off America the following year. James Buchanan. James Buchanan sold the right of redemption for the estate of Auchmar. He died without an heir in 1816. This line is now recognised as extinguished. Buchanan- Hamilton claim With the expiration of the Auchmar cadet line and in the absence of other contenders, it is claimed that in 1828 that Dr. Francis Buchanan-Hamilton of Spittal, Bardowie, and Leny established his claim as Chief of Clan Buchanan.History of the Scottish Highlands, Highland Clans and Highland Regiments,\\" edited by John S. Keltie, FSA Scot and which is duplicated in part on Electric Scotland. Francis was the son of Thomas Buchanan of Spittal and Leny (the Leny estate and title were inherited from Thomas’ first wife), and Elizabeth Hamilton of Bardowie. In 1815 Francis inherited his mother's estate and adopted the additional surname of Hamilton. His claim to Clan Buchanan chiefship comes through the Buchanan of Spittal cadet line from the fourth son of Walter 14th of Buchanan. Similar to the Buchanan of Auchmar claim, this implies that any cadet lines from Walter 14th of Buchanan through to John 19th of Buchanan are extinguished. Adams cites the successor to Buchanan of Auchmar as being Buchanan of Leny; however, the term Leny here should be read as a territorial designation and not an indication of the cadet line.On the wedding record of John Hamilton Buchanan and Phoebe Elizabeth Brock, 1884, John’s father is recorded as being John Buchanan- Hamilton of Leny. Dr. Francis Buchanan-Hamilton. Dr. Francis Buchanan-Hamilton (1762–1829) married Anne Brock and by her a son (John). John Buchanan- Hamilton. John Buchanan-Hamilton (1822–1903) married (1845) Margaret Seton and had three sons (Francis (1853–1893) who died unmarried and without heir, George (1856–1886) who died unmarried and without heir, and John his successor) and three daughter (Margaret, Ann and Katherine). John Hamilton Buchanan. John Hamilton Buchanan (1861–1919) married in 1884 Phoebe Elizabeth Brock but appears to have left no heir. This line is now recognised as extinguished. It is noteworthy that John was named John Hamilton Buchanan, thus the Hamilton name adopted by his grandfather became John's middle name. This brought his name in line with the subsequent Lord Lyon ruling on compound names. External evidence of historic claims Edinburgh and London Gazettes. An on-line search of the historic Edinburgh Gazette and London Gazette for notices pertaining to ‘laird of buchanan’, ‘buchanan of that ilk’ or ‘buchanan of buchanan’ and the alternate spelling of ‘Buchanan’ reveal no supporting evidence for either the Buchanan of Auchmar or Buchanan-Hamilton claims. The Buchanan Society. The Buchanan Society maintains and publishes a list of all past and current members by year of joining and membership number, and if provided, the relationship between its members, i.e. daughter of, great-grandson of, etc. The Buchanan Society Handbook 2004 lists # Francis Buchanan of Arnprior as joining (1727, #63). Estate is cited but no special status in the Clan. # William Buchanan of Auchmar as joining twice (1726, #48 and 1730, #123), and his grandson William Buchanan of Auchmar joining once (1794, #256). Both cited their estate but neither cited any special status in the Clan. # Francis Hamilton-Buchanan of Spittal, Bardowie and Leny (1771, #213); his son, John Buchanan-Hamilton of Spittal, Leny and Bardowie (1852, #410); and his grandson, John Hamilton Buchanan (Leny) Chartered Accountant (1882, #480) are likewise members of the Buchanan Society. Again estate and or occupation is listed but nothing to indicate any special status in the Clan. Public Register of the Lyon Court. The last record in the Public Register of the Lyon Court for undifferenced Arms of Buchanan (i.e., the Chief's Arms) was recorded in 1675. Arms are meant to be rematriculated within a year and a day of succession; however, it is common practice that Arms be borne on apparency, that is without matriculating the Arms, for two or three generations, beyond this it may be difficult or impossible to demonstrate heirship. So while there may have been discussions and determinations within the Clan hierarchy regarding the Clan Chief, the claims of neither Buchanan of Auchmar (1723–1816) nor Buchanan-Hamilton (1828–1919) appear to have been ratified in a legal sense. Despite a lack of evidence in the form of legal notices or recognition by the Lyon Court of either the Buchanan of Auchmar and Buchanan- Hamilton claims, both are known and accepted by contemporary or near contemporary authorities and authors.In a series of articles (initiated by genealogist and author, Walter Malise Graham Easton, and extended by Alexander Wilson Gray-Buchanan) and public response (including from John Parkes- Buchanan) in The Genealogical Magazine vols 2, 3 and 4 (1899-1901), aspects of specific cadet lines of Clan Buchanan are discussed. Mr Buchanan-Hamilton is cited as being the chief of the whole house of Buchanan. Unlike numerous other points, this assertion of Buchanan-Hamilton’s chiefship is not challenged. Noting that part of the Buchanan-Hamilton claim is that the cadet branch of Buchanan of Auchmar is extinct, Buchanan-Hamilton's wider cadet branch of Buchanan of Spittal would be a plausible starting point for search a hereditary claim on the chiefship of Clan Buchanan. However, in the event that a future hereditary claim is made, it is unlikely that the claim can build off either of the two earlier claims (because neither were recognised by the Lyon Court); consequently, it will be necessary to detail the claim back to 1675 and probably much earlier. The 21st-century clan chief Unlike the pre-18th-century chiefs, a 21st-century chief is not going to lead their clan in war or demand rents and levies. The experience of other clans is that their 21st-century chief: # adds to the clan's sense of completeness; # adds to the perceived prestige of the clan; # performs and adds dignity to ceremonial duties; # enables the clan to speak with one voice; # helps to focus clan effort on matters of clan wide interest; # represents clan interests in multi- clan forums; # promotes the right use of chiefly arms and associated heraldry; # promotes a general awareness and increased use of heraldry by the clanfolk; # interacts with the clan society in a similar way to how a constitutional monarchy interacts with the elected governments of his or her subjects; # appoints lieutenants to represent them when they cannot be present; and # uses modern communications to achieve effective (sometimes synchronous) communication between him or herself, the lieutenants and the clanfolk. Name spelling variations Early written renderings of the name include Balgquhannen, Balquhannan, Baquhanan, Bochannane, Bochannen, Bohannon, Boquehennan, Boquhannane, Boquhennane, Bowhanan, Bowhannan, Bucchanane, Buchanane, Buchanen, Buchannan, Buchannand, Buchannane, Buchanne, Buchannen, Buchannent, Buchquhannane, Buchquannan, Buchunnuch, Bucquanane, Buquhannan, Buquhannane, Buquhannanne, and Buquannane. More recent spellings include Buckanon, Buchannon, Bocanan, Buchanan etc. Castles The current seat of Clan Buchanan is Cambusmore. The historic seat of the Clan is Buchanan Auld House in Stirlingshire. Buchanan Castle was built in the 19th century as a replacement for Buchanan Auld House, after the surrounding lands had passed to the Grahams in the late 17th century. Other castles and monuments of the Clan Buchanan have included: Craigend Castle and Dunglass Castle (Dunbartonshire); Northbar House (Renfrewshire); and the Buchanan Monument at Killearn. Branches The cadet branches is order of separation from the chiefly line: Auchneven, Leny, Arnprior, Spital, and Auchmar.

Sourced from: Clan organisations There are three contemporary organisations which represent the Clan Buchanan. The Buchanan Society The Buchanan Society is a purely charitable organisation established in 1725 in Glasgow, Scotland, for the needy of the Clan. The foundation of the Society featured the great trading houses of the Clan but from all corners of the globe contemporary clan folk and friends of the Clan of all professions and occupations support this charity. The Society is funded by an entry fee paid by each member of the Society, gifts and interest from investments. Its original charter specified charity to those of the name Buchanan and recognised septs by assisting boys to trades and those of promising genius at their studies to university. Except that girls are now eligible for assistance, the goals have remained largely unchanged. The Society has been given many Clan heirlooms. The books, records and other collections of the Society are held at the Mitchell Library, Glasgow, and Strathclyde University Library. The Society also owns the Buchanan Monument in Killearn, and the Loch Lomond island of Clairinch. Clan Buchanan Society International CBSI Coat of Arms The Clan Buchanan Society International (CBSI) is a mutual interest society established in 1970 at the Grandfather Mountain Games in North Carolina to promote the celebration of being a Buchanan. Membership is by annual subscription and is greatest in the US, but as the organisation matures, new chapters are being established around the world, especially in the Oceania region. CBSI Black Lion Banner The CBSI Black Lion Banner.Emails from President CBSI, David Byrne, of 11 and 14 Sep 2012 CBSI uses the coat of arms granted by the Lyon Court in 2002 on its official correspondence; however, it uses a self-assumed coat of arms which predate the granted arms on its flag, which is called the Black Lion Banner. The Black Lion Banner has a field of gold/yellow charged with a black lion rampant with red claws and tongue shedding five silver tears all within a black double tressure flory-counter-flory. (This might be described in heraldic language as, \\"Or, a lion rampant Sable, armed and langued Gules charged with five goutte Argent all within a double tressure flory-counter-flory of the second.\\") The lion rampant on the field of gold within the double tressure flory-counter-flory alludes to the arms of the Clan chief and is the charge and tressure of most Buchanan arms. The silver tears refer to the sadnessTo be heraldically correct tears are represented by gottee Azure (blue) http://www.heraldryclipart.com/symbolism/d.html of the Clan at not having a chief. A variation of the Black Lion Banner is used on some CBSI apparel. Chief’s Council of Armigers The Chief's Council of Armigers is an organisation comprising Clan armigers whose aim is to optimise the strategic leadership of the Clan in order to promote Clan interests globally with due regard for tradition, Scottish law, and contemporary needs and opportunities. The Council subscribes to the view that the principal interest of the Clan is not power, influence, glory, history, heraldry nor even honour, per se; rather, it is the encouragement of the clan folk to learn, enjoy and celebrate their unique Buchanan, Highland, Scottish heritage. It is against this interest that the Council's efforts are evaluated. New Chief The Lord Lyon King of Arms has now recognised a new chief of the Clan Buchanan.

History  Sunrise was founded by a young Julius Lighton and his son-in-law, Walter Eger. Initially, the two bought out Jupp & Sons, a small confectionery business in Abbotsford, Melbourne. Two years later, another of Julius Lighton's sons-in- law, Rudi Moser, joined him, and in 1949, they acquired a second small confectionery company, E. & H. Ihles, in another Melbourne suburb, Camberwell. The official logo for Sunrise Confectioners. In 1951, these companies were merged into Sunrise. Three years later, after the phenomenal success of his confectionery companies, Sunrise purchased a larger factory in Greville Street, Prahran, Melbourne, to consolidate production. Over the years, Sunrise Confectioners produced a multitude of confectionery. Including jersey caramel, yummy things and chocolate bullets, boiled confectionery such as acid drops, bullseyes and barley sugar, toasted marshmallows, hundreds & thousands (Sunrise introduced the blue hundreds & thousands first), and traditional jellies such as aniseed rings, fruit rings and soft fruit jubes. In the 1960s, Rudi Moser was joined by two of Walter Eger's sons, Michael and Andrew Eger. Over the next twenty years the trio strengthened the company, firmly establishing its place in the Australian market, and the overseas market, in particular England. Rudi Moser's son-in-law, Ken Klooger, joined the company in 1987. In 1991, the jelly production was relocated to larger premises at Notting Hill, in Melbourne's south-east. In 1992, inspired by trends in the European market, Sunrise founded The Natural Confectionery Co. as an umbrella brand for their new line of products using no artificial colours and no artificial flavours. It began as a small range named Binka's, consisting of three products aimed at a niche market, but evolved in response to considerable demand. In June 1997, the emphasis shifted from Binka's to The Natural Confectionery Co. Due to successful advertising and marketing campaigns, increased distribution and a growing range of products, sales grew dramatically. The official logo for Binka's. By 2003, The Natural Confectionery Co. product range consisted of 18 products, including sweet, sour and soft jubes. The Natural Confectionery Company's jellies had become the most popular jelly product on Australian supermarket shelves. In April 2003 The Natural Confectionery Company was bought out by Cadbury Schweppes group of companies. The company has also diversified into beverages. In 2008 Cadbury Schweppes introduced products under \\"The Natural Confectionery Company\\" brand in the United Kingdom and used advertisements that gave the sweets voices and often surreal catchphrases such as \\"Bring on the trumpets!\\" voiced by British actors Matt Berry and Rupert Degas.

However, by 1988 that capability had become so common on calculators that it was no longer a feature of distinction, as it was an assumed characteristic of all serious scientific and business calculators. So beginning with the HP-28S, HP-17B, HP-19B, and HP-27S, the feature suffix \\"C\\" was replaced with a class suffix which was more meaningful in the market: \\"S\\" for Scientific, \\"B\\" for Business, and later (in 1993) \\"G\\" for Graphic. Design Clamshell The HP-28 calculators shared a flip-open (\\"clamshell\\") case. On the left side of the flip, there is an alphabetic keyboard (in alphabetic order). On the right was a typical scientific keyboard layout. LCD display The display was a 137×32 LCD dot matrix, usually displaying four lines of information (3 stack/command lines, plus one softkey label line). Lack of computer interface Among the drawbacks of the HP-28 was the lack of a computer interface. This meant that stored information could only be entered through the keypad and not backed up. Weak battery cover This model (and the HP-19 series that used the same clamshell design and internals) had one design problem that affected many units: the springs inside the unit that made contact with its three N-sized batteries made a considerably strong force, and the notches on the case in which the lid edges slid were too thin and shallow. Even if the case itself was sturdy enough, those notches were under extreme pressure, most especially while the user was opening or closing the lid (such as during the replacement of the batteries). As the lid edges were made of a harder metal, the plastic notches in the case were prone to cracking or breaking, even in carefully kept devices. Surviving examples of the earlier versions of this calculator frequently have rubber bands around or tape over the cover to hold it in place (including the image attached to this article). This defect was later remedied on the HP-19BII, by putting the battery cover underneath the chassis.

He was one of the first modern art dealers who provided support to his painters with stipends and solo exhibitions. Early life Born Paul-Marie-Joseph Durand-Ruel in Paris, his father was a picture dealer. In 1865 young Paul took over the family business, which represented artists such as Corot and the Barbizon school of French landscape painting. In 1867 he moved his gallery from 1 rue de la Paix, Paris, to 16 rue Laffitte, with a branch at 111 rue Le Peletier.Eric Hazan, David Fernbach (trans.) (2011). The Invention of Paris: A History in Footsteps. London; New York: Verso Books. . Accessed September 2013. During the 1860s and early 1870s Durand-Ruel was an important advocate and successful art dealer of the Barbizon School. However Durand-Ruel soon established a relationship with a group of painters who would become known as the Impressionists. London During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, Durand-Ruel left Paris and escaped to London, where he met up with a number of French artists including Charles-François Daubigny, Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro.Biography for: Paul Durand-Ruel In December 1870 he opened the first of ten Annual Exhibitions of the Society of French Artists at his new London gallery at 168 New Bond Street, under the management of Charles Deschamps. Impressionism He recognized the artistic and fashionable potential of Impressionism as early as 1870, and his first major exhibition of their work took place at his London gallery in 1872. Eventually Durand-Ruel had exhibitions of Impressionism and other works (including the expatriate American painter James Abbott McNeill Whistler who lived in London), at his Paris and London galleries. He also brought their work to New York, where his three sons, Joseph, Charles, and George, ran the gallery on a daily basis, in the early days alternating established New York artists with French impressionists, and doing much to establish the popularity of Impressionist art in the United States.Between March 1–15, 1897 they exhibited works by Adolfo Müller-Ury the exhibition being preceded by one by Renoir and followed by one of Pissarro. During the final three decades of the 19th century Durand- Ruel became the best known art dealer and most important commercial advocate of French Impressionism in the world. He succeeded in establishing the market for Impressionism in the United States as well as in Europe. Edgar Degas, Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, are among the important Impressionist artists that Durand-Ruel helped to establish. He represented many lesser known artists including Maxime Dethomas or Hugues Merle amongst others. Regarding the Americans’ open-mindedness towards impressionism, Durand-Ruel once said, \\"The American public does not laugh. It buys!\\"Mendelsohn, Meredith and Meghan Dailey. “The Purveyor of Modern Life” Art+Auction, November 2009. “Without America,” he said, “I would have been lost, ruined, after having bought so many Monets and Renoirs. The two exhibitions there in 1886 saved me. The American public bought moderately . . . but thanks to that public, Monet and Renoir were enabled to live and after that the French public followed suit.” Durand-Ruel had an intense rivalry with Parisian art dealer Georges Petit (1856–1920). Durand-Ruel was the subject of a major temporary exhibition titled \\"Inventing Impressionism\\" held at the National Gallery in London in 2015. This exhibition became the focus of a documentary film by EXHIBITION ON SCREEN titled The Impressionists - And The Man Who Made Them and an episode of the ITV show Great Art, both produced by Seventh Art Productions.

Andrew Lang included it in The Olive Fairy Book. It contains inset tales that are similar to ones in Arabian Nights. Synopsis A pasha's son one day was playing with his golden ball, and three times broke a woman's pitcher. She cursed him to fall in love with the silent princess, and vanished. As he grew older, he wondered who the silent princess was, and in time wondered so much that he became ill. His father asked what had made him ill, in hopes that it would reveal his cure, and the son revealed the curse and asked permission to search the world for her. His father granted it. The prince set out with an old steward, and after three old men gave them directions and warnings, he finally found the mountain where the princess sat behind seven veils and never spoke. The mountain was surrounded by human bones and mourners, who warned the prince that he needed the leave of the sultan to be escorted into the princess's presence, and the bones could tell him the effect of his decision. The prince could not think of a way to make her talk, so he put off speaking to the sultan until he had one. While there, the prince bought a nightingale, and found it could talk. It asked him why he was so sad, and when he told the bird his story, she told him to go, and when the princess would not speak, he must tell her he would instead converse with the candlestick, where the nightingale would be hidden. The prince obeyed. The princess would not speak to him, so he spoke to the candlestick, and the nightingale said it had been years since anyone had spoken to her, so she would tell him a story. She described how a king set three wooers to learn something in six months, and the cleverest would win the princess. One learned how to travel a year's journey in an hour; another to see things at a distance; the third to cure any illness. They met again, and the second saw the princess was dying, the first brought the third to her, and the third one cured her. Then the prince and the nightingale argued whether the second or the third had done the better, until the princess burst out that it would have been useless without the first, who should have her. A slave ran to tell the sultan, but the princess persuaded him, by signs, to make the prince make her speak three times. She destroyed the candlestick. The next night, the nightingale hid on a pillar, and the prince talked to it. The nightingale told of a woman who had scorned wooers for many years, until she found a white hair and decided to pick one. She set them to tasks. She told the first wooer that her father had died, and proved to be a wizard because his grave was empty; the man's task was to lay in the grave three hours, so the woman would be free of him. He lay down there at once. She told a second wooer that a wizard had taken the place of her father's body in the grave; if he stood over the wizard with a stone and smashed his head if he moved, she would be free. The man took such a stone and sat down at once. She told a third wooer that a wizard had taken the place of her father's body in the grave, but if he brought him before her, she would be free. He immediately brought the body before her. Then the nightingale argued whether the second or third wooer had done the best, until the princess said it was the first. That day, she destroyed the pillar. The third night, the nightingale hid in the curtains by the door, and told the prince of a carpenter, a tailor, and a student who lived in the same house. The carpenter made a statue of a woman; the tailor dressed it; the student prayed to heaven that she might become a living woman. The nightingale and prince quarreled over whether the carpenter or the tailor had the best right to marry her, until the princess said that the student's prayer meant he should win her. At that, her veils fell, and she agreed to marry the prince. They sent for the woman whose pitchers he had broken, and she became a nurse to their children.

Plot The game's events are set in the year 2877. In 2077, the world's peacekeeping unions, such as the United Nations and the European Union, collapsed after years of global tensions, forcing humanity to establish a planetary government in order to maintain order. A government operating as the World Silent Security Service, also known as the W.S.S.S., is established and world peace is restored. The WSSS takes control of both the planet Earth and outer space, establishing its headquarters on the Central Control Station Daedalus in earth orbit. The WSSS eradicates the control of all previous unions and organizations and unites the whole of humanity under its control for over 800 years. However, with all of its original creators gone by that point in time, humanity questions the justification of Deadulus's rule, and some begin to rebel against the government in the wake of its so-called archaic policies. The leading rebel group in this massive rebellion, the Reformist Faction, sends three elite pilots of the highly sophisticated Laocorn-class Assault Robots on a covert mission to destroy Daedalus. Once inside, two Laocorns are immediately destroyed, leaving the one survivor, the player character, to face Daedalus' massive robot armies and transverse vast, dark corridors in his quest to destroy Daedalus and to save humanity. Gameplay The player has to fight through thirty floors of the Deadalus space station to destroy the core at the top. The floors are randomly generated. For every floor of the station there is a key card in a random location, required to unlock the elevator to the next stage. A few floors require the player to seek and destroy the station's reactor cores. The player can also find floor maps and light switches for darkened floors, but neither are required for progress. The player's mech-armor, the Laocorn, is equipped with four different weapons and a generator that enables the mech to perform several abilities. The weapons consist of an arm-punch, vulcan, laser gun and missile launcher, each of which is upgradable in power and ammunition count. There are kamikaze enemies that appear if the player stays too long on a floor that carry items that, if picked up, degrade whichever weapon they are armed with at that time. The Laocorn's generator abilities are hover, allowing the mech to hover a few feet over energy grids; refresh, which replenishes the mech's energy; plasma barrier, which serves as a temporary shield; and the blaze laser, which destroys every enemy on screen. Each ability consumes generator energy, which can be refilled through pick-up items. Reception The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game a 7.125 out of 10 average, describing it as one of the best first person shooters to date. They cited the graphics, storyline, and most especially the deep strategic approach to combat as the game's strong points, though some of the reviewers felt the levels had too little variation between them. In contrast, Sega Saturn Magazine gave the game a 70%, citing dull gameplay, monotonous visuals, lack of appropriate music, and absence of any gore, accessing it as a mediocre Doom clone. GamePro was also underwhelmed by the game, saying that it plays very smoothly but suffers from a lack of imagination in the enemies and the backgrounds. They concluded that \\"ultimately, it's too simplistic to be much more than ... a nice waste of time.\\" Maximum praised the \\"dark, eerie feel\\" created by the graphics and sound effects but criticized the gameplay as simplistic and lacking in variety. They gave it two out of five stars, concluding the game to be \\"simply not worth the money.\\" Next Generation reviewed Deadalus, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Deadalus is a good bit of pretty packaging without much on the inside.\\" In their late 1996 overview of the Saturn library, Next Generation gave brief reviews of both the North American release and the Japanese release as Daedalus, giving one out of five stars to the former but three out of five stars to the latter. They commented that the game lacks impact and excitement. In a retrospective, Hardcore Gamer said \\"Robtica's engine is underwhelming – even by the standards of its era – with an inconsistent frame rate that often drops to a sluggish slow-motion. It’s not the best-performing or looking game, and there are far superior shooters on the Saturn that fare better in visuals and performance.\\" In early 1997 Sega Saturn Magazines Rich Leadbetter ranked Robotica the worst of the five first person shooters released for the Saturn in Europe up to that point (the others being Hexen: Beyond Heretic, Alien Trilogy, Doom, and PowerSlave), remarking that \\"although it is pretty smooth and quite enjoyable to begin with, the game is crushingly boring with very little to differentiate between one level and the rest.\\" References External links *Robotica at SegaSaturn.co.uk 1995 video games Dystopian video games First-person shooters Video games about mecha Sega video games Sega Saturn games Sega Saturn-only games Science fiction video games Video games developed in Japan Video games set in the 29th century Genki (company) games ","title":"Robotica"},{"id":"5791305","text":"See also .USS Sam Houston (1861) was a small (66-ton) schooner captured by the Union Navy during the beginning of the American Civil War.

Noted for first ascents in the 1960s and 1970s, he is the author of many articles and books. Ament began climbing in 1958, and by the mid 1960s had established the first 5.11 climbs in Colorado (Supremacy Crack) and Yosemite (Center Route on the Slack). A college gymnast, he was a dedicated boulderer and put up many challenging problems on Flagstaff Mountain in Boulder, Colorado, elsewhere in Colorado and in Yosemite Valley. His climbing and bouldering companions over the years have included Royal Robbins, Bob Kamps, Don Whillans, Tom Higgins, John Gill, and Layton Kor. Ament's best known written works are his biographies of Royal Robbins and John Gill. He wrote a compendium of ascents and climbers in his 2002 work, \\"Wizards of Rock: A History of Free Climbing in America,\\" and his \\"Climbing Everest\\" is a philosophical essay, adorned with cartoons by the author. Ament is a poet and artist. He won the \\"Artist Award\\" from the Art Department of the University of Colorado in 1967. He is a photographer and has given talks around the country, illustrated with his photos. He was twice guest speaker for the British National Mountaineering Festival and has won several awards for films he has made, including from Austria and the University of Geneva, Switzerland. In September, 2013, Ament was inducted into the Boulder Sports Hall of Fame.

It is an adaptation of Mitch Cullin's novel of the same name. The film was shot in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, and the surrounding area in late 2004. The world premiere was at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival where the film was met with mixed response from both viewers and critics. After little interest from U.S. distributors, THINKFilm picked the film up for a U.S. release date in October 2006. Plot Tideland centers on an abandoned child, Jeliza-Rose, and her solitary adventures during one summer in rural Texas while staying at a rundown farmhouse called What Rocks, and focuses on the increasingly dark, imaginative fantasy life the girl creates with the aid of dismembered Barbie doll heads that she often wears on her fingertips. With names such as Mystique, Sateen Lips, Baby Blonde and Glitter Gal, the doll heads not only engage in long conversations with Jeliza-Rose, reflecting different aspects of the girl's psyche, but also act as her companions while she explores the barren Texas landscape. After her mother overdoses on Methadone, Jeliza-Rose and her father, Noah, flee to Noah's mother's home, a remote Texas farmhouse. Noah fears that with all the drugs in their house he will lose Jeliza-Rose and be sent to prison, so he attempts to set it alight before they leave, although Jeliza-Rose manages to stop him. They find the farmhouse abandoned, but they settle in anyway. Their first night there, Noah dies from a heroin overdose. For much of the rest of the film, Noah's corpse remains seated upright in a living room chair with sunglasses covering his eyes. As her father slowly begins to decompose, Jeliza-Rose doesn't readily acknowledge his death because she has grown accustomed to him being unconscious for long periods at a time. Instead, she retreats deeper and deeper into her own mind, exploring the tall grass around the farmhouse, relying on her doll heads for friendship as an unconscious way of keeping herself from feeling too lonely and afraid. During Jeliza-Rose's wanderings, she eventually encounters and befriends her neighbors, a mentally impaired young man called Dickens and his older sister Dell who is blind in one eye from a bee sting. At this point the story begins to unfold, revealing a past connection between Dell and Jeliza-Rose's deceased father. The eccentric neighbors take the girl under their wing, going so far as to preserve Noah's body via taxidermy (which Dell and Dickens did to their own dead mother). Amorous feelings, initiated mostly by the much younger Jeliza-Rose, begin to creep into the childlike relationship between her and Dickens, and it is revealed that the deeply troubled Dickens, a man-child who once drove a school bus in front of an oncoming train, keeps a stash of dynamite in his bedroom that he intends to use against the \\"Monster Shark\\" he believes is roaming the countryside. The Monster Shark is, in reality, the nightly passenger train that travels past the farmhouse where Jeliza-Rose and her dead father reside. It is also revealed that Dell and Noah are not only \\"kissers,\\" but also brother and sister, after Jeliza-Rose finds the trinkets in the dead mother's room to belong to her father. At the end of the film, following a violent confrontation between Dell, Dickens and Jeliza-Rose, a train wreck is caused by Dickens' dynamite, creating a scene of chaos near the farmhouse. Wandering about the wreckage, and among the confusion of injured travelers, Jeliza-Rose is discovered by a woman who survived, and she assumes the little girl is also a victim of the train wreck. The film ends with the woman embracing Jeliza-Rose, who stares with stunned confusion at the wreckage.

Press conference on Tideland. At Spain's 2005 San Sebastian Festival, Tideland was awarded the esteemed FIPRESCI Prize, selected by an international jury of critics who, in their award statement, said: \\"Our jury focused on the international competition and found Terry Gilliam's Tideland to be the best film of the selection—a decision which provoked controversial reactions.\\" The jury consisted of Andrei Plakhov, Russia, President (Kommersant), Julio Feo Zarandieta, France (Radio France Internationale), Wolfgang Martin Hamdorf, Germany (Film-Dienst), Massimo Causo, Italy (Corriere Del Giorno), and Sergi Sanchez, Spain (La Razón). In response to the controversy surrounding the film's FIPRESCI win at San Sebastian, jurist Sergi Sanchez wrote: \\"Gilliam's was the only one that dared to propose a risky and radical image, without any concessions, on a specific matter: madness as the only way of escaping in the face of a hostile environment. All this is endlessly coherent with the director's body of work, which has been frequently misunderstood by the critics, the industry, and audiences alike.\\" Defending Gilliam's film while also placing it in the context of the director's previous works, as well as explaining the jury's decision, Sanchez concluded by stating, \\"Fighting against windmills is, after all, the same as fighting against the prejudices that trap creative freedom.\\" The subsequent mainstream reviews of Tideland were largely mixed, with Japan being the only country where it was both a critical and box office success. The film was first released in Russia (February 2006) followed by the Netherlands (March 2006) and Greece (May 2006). After almost a year without any US distribution, the film was picked up for American release by THINKFilm, and subsequently opened in the US, earning just $7,276 from one theater during its first week run. The film's release was then expanded, but to only nine theatres, for a total domestic gross of $66,453. Since then, several independent cinemas and art museums have presented the film as a special event, including IFC Center and the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. Gilliam has openly criticized THINKFilm for the manner in which the company handled the American theatrical release of the film, and their unauthorized tampering with the aspect ratio of the film for its US DVD release. He has also gone on record as saying that nearly all his films have initially garnered mixed reactions from critics, and in at least one interview, as well as in the introduction to Tideland, he has stated that he believes many moviegoers will hate Tideland, others will love it, and some just won't know what to think about it. Gilliam has also said that Michael Palin, another former member of Monty Python, had told him that the film was either the best thing he had ever done, or the worstalthough Palin himself couldn't quite decide either way. Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman gave Tideland an \\"F\\", calling it \\"gruesomely awful\\". In the subsequent review of the DVD release, Gleiberman's fellow Entertainment Weekly critic Clark Collis gave the film a \\"B\\" and stated: \\"Terry Gilliam's grim fairy tale is another fantastic(al) showcase for his visual talents.\\" The film received a \\"two thumbs way down\\" rating from Richard Roeper and guest critic A.O. Scott on the television show Ebert & Roeper. Scott said that toward the end, the film was \\"creepy, exploitive, and self-indulgent,\\" a sentiment that was echoed in his New York Times review of the film.\\"Tideland: A Girl Endures a No-Man’s Land by Dwelling in the Make- Believe,\\" A. O. Scott, The New York Times, 13 October 2006 Like Scott, Roeper had a strong negative opinion, saying, \\"I hated this film,\\" and \\"I came very close to walking out of the screening room. And I never do that.\\"Audio recording of Scott and Roeper review of Tideland. In the Chicago Reader, critic Jonathan Rosenbaum said the film was \\"hallucinatory and extremely unpleasant\\" and warned readers, \\"Enter this diseased Lewis Carroll universe at your own risk.\\" The Chicago Tribune critic Michael Wilmington, however, praised the film, further stating that \\"... it's crazy, dangerous and sometimes gorgeous ...\\", and Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News wrote, \\"Tideland, for me, is a masterpiece\\", a blurb featured on the DVD release. Filmmaker David Cronenberg described the film as a \\"poetic horror film\\", a quote which was used in the advertising campaign for the theatrical release. Filmmaker Rian Johnson named Tideland and The Fountain as his favorite films of 2006. In the 16 July 2007 online edition of Independent Film Channel News, Michael Atkinson published a comparative film review of Harry Kümel's rarely seen Malpertuis (1971) and Tideland. Atkinson posits that a historical perspective has made Kümel's previously scorned film a more viable creation when far removed from the cultural context in which it was first released. He goes on to argue that Tideland could be the 21st century counterpart to Malpertuis, suggesting that Gilliam's film \\"is a snark-hunted freak just waiting for its historical moment, decades from now, when someone makes a case for it as a neglected masterpiece.\\" Home media The DVD of Tideland was released on 27 February 2007 in a 2-disc \\"Collector's Edition\\", with a commentary track, many interviews, deleted scenes (with a forced commentary over the original audio), and a making-of documentary entitled Getting Gilliam, made by Cube director Vincenzo Natali. There has been some controversy among fans over the aspect ratio presented on the Region 1 DVD released by THINKFilm for the United States, which is 1.78:1, instead of the aspect ratio prepared and approved by Gilliam and the director of photography (in theaters, it was shown in 2.35:1, but Gilliam wanted to open up the image slightly for home video, somewhere between 2.10:1 and 2.25:1). There were early reports that DVD releases in Canada (Region 1) and other regions used the theatrical aspect ratio, but these have proven to be entirely false. The Region 3 DVD was rumored to feature the fully corrected transfer, but this was later debunked on the same website where the claim was made; as shown in a purported screen capture of the Hong Kong release, the Region 3 DVD uses the incorrect aspect ratio. The UK (Region 2) release, does have a 2.10:1 aspect ratio. The German EuroVideo–Concorde Home Entertainment release has been independently verified to use the theatrical 2.35:1 ratio, as is seen in screen captures from it. OFDb.de also gives this ratio for the German release. Both THINKFilm and Gilliam have publicly stated that they are working on a solution to the ratio problem and will release a corrected version for sale as soon as possible. That did not happen until the BluRay editions were released a decade later, long after THINKFilm had gone out of business.

It is located at 1231 11th Avenue in downtown Altoona, Pennsylvania. It replaced the original PRR Altoona station built in the 1880s. The Transportation Center's modernist- influenced main building is built into the lower levels of a parking garage and connects to a network of pedestrian bridges which criss-cross the busy roads and tracks surrounding the facility. The Center also features a 300-foot-long bus platform capable of serving up to 9 buses at once. The interior of the Center has space for businesses previously home to offices and a cafe, which now sit vacant, leaving the Center's only two tenants as Amtrak and Greyhound.  Bus Service   AMTRAN  AMTRAN is the local public transit provider in the greater Altoona area and the primary user of the Altoona Transportation Center. Almost all regular AMTRAN bus routes and selected \\"Tripper\\" routes stop at the center, which is considered the AMTRAN system's primary hub. AMTRAN is typically the sole user of the bus platform, though exceptions have been made due to road work or special events.  Greyhound  Greyhound provides intercity bus service to the station with a single route. It connects Altoona via one-seat rides to cities such as State College and Harrisburg to the east and Johnstown and Pittsburgh to the west. Buses 4690 and 4692 run eastbound with a terminus of Harrisburg in the morning and evening respectively. Buses 4691 and 4693 head West toward Pittsburgh. The prior/following stops of Tyrone and Ebensburg are treated as flag stops, due to their lack of staffed ticket service.  Train service  The Altoona Transportation Center is also served by Amtrak's Pennsylvanian. These trains operate once per day in each direction. Eastbound #42 is scheduled at 10:01 a.m., while Westbound #43 is scheduled at 5:09 p.m. Due to the train running on freight right-of-way, there are frequent delays which cause the scheduled times to serve mostly as estimates. Primary cities served by Amtrak to and from Altoona include Harrisburg, Lancaster, Philadelphia, and New York to the east and Johnstown and Pittsburgh to the west. Staffed ticket service is available for both daily departures.  History  A Westbound Pennsylvanian stops at the temporary station, June 1981. The Altoona Transportation Center stands on the site of the old Altoona station, which was constructed in 1887 immediately to the West of the Logan House Hotel. The old station building was demolished in 1971, however construction on the Transportation Center did not begin until after 1982, leaving Altoona without a proper train station for over a decade. In order to maintain a station stop in the city, Amtrak installed a construction trailer in a small parking lot along the recently- reconstructed PRR Expressway (10th Avenue). This temporary station lacked an elevated platform, indoor bathrooms, and staffed ticket service. The Transportation Center's planning was a controversial topic in the Altoona area. Candidates for various city positions structured their campaigns around the expense of, feasibility of, and location of the pending transit hub. Projected costs ranged anywhere from 10 million dollars to 3 million dollars. On August 12, 1982, the Altoona Area Chamber of Commerce voted unanimously in favor of a new Transportation Center. By October of the same year Harry Weese and Associates, an architectural firm from Washington D.C., had been chosen to conduct a series of surveys in order to determine the optimal location for the proposed structure. Ultimately, urban renewal parcels 14A, 14B, 16A, and 16B were chosen, and the Transportation Center was merged into an existing Altoona Parking Authority project, creating the hybrid parking garage/transit facility that exists today. The facility opened on October 23, 1986 after being completed for $3.2 million, an estimated $500,000 under budget. The cost of construction was completely covered by a federal grant. The early days of Amtrak service were turbulent. Over the fifteen-year span that Altoona was served by a temporary station, the National Limited (a replacement service for the famous Spirit of St. Louis) made both its first stop in the city as well as its last, as did the Keystone and Fort Pitt. By the Transit Center's completion, Altoona was served by only two daily trains, the Broadway Limited and the Pennsylvanian. In 1995 the Broadway Limited was suspended and replaced by the Three Rivers, which lasted until 2005. Upon its cancellation, the lone Pennsylvanian marked the first time in Altoona's significant railway history that the town was served by just a single, daily passenger train in each direction. In March 2020, the Pennsylvanian was suspended as part of a system- wide service reduction in response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic. Service resumed on June 1, 2020.

Catheter replacement of the aortic valve (called trans-aortic valve replacement or implementation [TAVR or TAVI]) is a minimally invasive option for those suffering from aortic valve stenosis. TAVR is commonly performed by guiding a catheter from the groin to the narrowed valve via the aorta using realtime x-ray technology. A metal stent containing a valve is then deployed using a balloon to press the stent into the valve in effect opening the stenosed (or narrowed) valve and lodging the stent in place. The procedure was first approved in the United States in November 2011 as an alternative for people deemed a poor candidate for open approach replacement; however, TAVR has been successfully implemented into practice in other countries prior to 2011.

SCI has more than 50,000 members and 180 local chapters. SCI members agree to abide by the organization's code of ethics, which includes making a positive contribution to wildlife and ecosystems, complying with game laws, and assisting game and fish officers. Leadership Safari Club International was founded by C.J. McElroy and fellow hunters in 1972. Early chapters were founded in Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Arizona, and Mississippi. McElroy was an accomplished hunter, hunting on six continents and in nearly 50 countries with over 200 record-book specimens, but he was forced to resign in 1988. SCI's organizational structure consists of the executive committee, which includes the officers, and a board of directors composed of SCI chapter presidents, regional representatives, directors at-large, and international directors. All are elected to their posts from within the membership. Safari Club International holds an annual convention.  Locations  SCI’s headquarters are located in Tucson, Arizona. The legislative office is located in Washington, DC, within walking distance of Capitol Hill. Its sister organization, the SCI Foundation, operates a wildlife museum in the Tucson facility. It also owns the Granite Ranch in the Bridger-Teton National Forest, south of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where it hosts the American Wilderness Leadership School. Safari Club International Foundation SCI's sister organization, the Safari Club International Foundation, is a nonprofit organization \\"dedicated to wildlife conservation, outdoor education, and humanitarian services.\\" Although this foundation was set up by SCI and shares some board members with SCI, it is a separate legal entity. The SCI Foundation operates a number of programs. Sportsmen Against Hunger began in 1989, and through the network of SCI chapters, provides food banks with meat from harvested animals. SCI reportedin 2006 yhat over 250,000 lb of wild game were donated to charitable relief organizations. The Sensory Safari program allows sight-impaired individuals to get a “visual” perspective of what animals are like by feeling mounts, skins, skulls, horns, and antlers. The National Federation of the Blind (NFB) asked SCIF to host a Sensory Safari at its annual convention. In 1997, the NFB signed a memorandum of understanding with SCI to host Sensory Safaris at all future NFB national and state conventions. Hunters who participate in the SafariCare program take bags filled by SCI chapters with medical, school, and relief supplies to clinics and schools in remote regions of the developing world. The SafariWish program, part of the SafariCare program, is designed to give children with life-threatening illnesses a chance to go hunting. The Disabled Hunter program, through SCI chapters, provides sponsorship for hunting trips for disabled sportsmen. Annual hunters' convention Taxidermy display from SCI 2011 hunters' convention Since 1973, SCI has hosted an annual hunters' convention. In 2013, over 25,000 SCI members, and 1,000 exhibitors participated in the convention. In 2018, there were more than 18,000 attendees. The 2021 and 2022 conventions will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada. Publications The organization publishes a bimonthly magazine titled Safari that features hunting stories, issues affecting the hunting sportsman, reviews of books and equipment, and conservation reports. Safari has a special awards issue, which honors trophy hunters each year. The news publication of the organization is Safari Times. Additional outlets include SCI News, a weekly e-newsletter and a podcast titled Tag Soup. Record Book The Safari Club International Record Book is the largest such record-keeping system in the world. Trophies are measured and listed according to size (horns, antlers, tusks, and/or body size), where taken (free range or estate), how taken (bow and arrow, rifle, muzzleloader) and whether typical or atypical for the species. Medals and awards are presented dependent on ranking within species. This book ranks every species of game animal using the SCI official scoring method. The book allows hunters to gain recognition for their hunting skills. It is also used by scientific institutions and governments to provide an index of the health of wildlife populations. Political lobbying In 1979, when SCI was fairly new, it sought government approval to import 1,125 trophies from 40 different species (gorillas, cheetahs, tigers, orangutans, snow leopards, and others) into the US for \\"scientific research and incentive for propagation and survival of the species.\\" Because the animals were to be hunted, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service denied the request. Polar bear imports In 1994, SCI successfully lobbied for a change in the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to allow for the importation of previously banned, legally hunted polar bear trophies into the United States from Canada. In 2007, SCI testified at a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) hearing opposing the proposed listing of polar bears as a \\"threatened\\" species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. The FWS is concerned that climate change places polar bears at risk of extinction. SCI stated, \\"[...] [T]he U.S. decision to list will merely change the identity of those who hunt the animals from U.S. hunters to exclusively native residents[...]\\" Criticism Endangered species SCI has been criticized by the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) for supporting the hunting of endangered African antelope species at game ranches in Texas and Florida and for giving awards for hunting African leopards, elephants, lions, rhinos, and buffaloes, despite the fact that only the rhinoceros is endangered. SCI, along with other hunting and nonhunting organizations, intervened in a federal suit where HSUS challenged regulations that allow hunting of captive scimitar- horned oryx, dama gazelle, and addax. The FWS found that, “[c]aptive breeding in the United States has enhanced the propagation or survival of the scimitar- horned oryx, addax, and dama gazelle worldwide by rescuing these species from near extinctions and providing the founder stock necessary for reintroduction. The scimitar-horned oryx is extinct in the wild across its range in North Africa, having been last seen in Niger and Chad in the mid-1980s. The dama gazelle and addax are rumored to exist in only a few small and highly fragmented populations in the most remote parts of the Sahara Desert. According to SCI, however, healthy populations of all three species still exist in the United States.https://firstforwildlife.com/2015/11/24/saving-the- three-amigos/ Sport hunting of surplus, captive-bred animals generates revenue that supports these captive-breeding operations and may relieve hunting pressure on wild populations.” As of February 2008, this case is still pending. In the case of the black rhino, 83% of those countries represented at the 2004 CITES meeting approved sport hunting of the species in very limited numbers. Members engaged in unethical hunting practices and poaching Ken Behring was a former president of SCI and was at one time its largest donor. He has made multiple safari trips to East Africa, and has shot lions, leopard]s, rhinoceroses, an elephant, and an endangered bighorn sheep. Behring has been criticized for his trophy-hunting practices and animal-conservation ethics. In 1997, Behring shot an endangered Kara Tau argali sheep in Kazakhstan (only 100 remained in the world at the time). Behring claimed he had permits to shoot the sheep and had Russian scientists in his hunting party; he was issued export permits two days before the enactment of a prior international decision to move Kara Tau argali to the most-endangered status. Per American law, the remains of the endangered animal could not be legally imported into the United States. Behring donated $20 million to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History six weeks later, offering his private collection of stuffed hunting trophies to the museum, including four rare bighorn sheep, one of which was the Kara Tau argali sheep. The Smithsonian attempted to import the remains by petitioning the Department of the Interior for an Endangered Species Act waiver, but withdrew its request after questioning and negative publicity from Representative George Miller and groups like the HSUS. Behring maintained that he had broken no laws, and had shot the animal legally while assisting Kazakh scientists. The National Museum of Natural History subsequently re-evaluated their acquisitions policies in light of the charges. In 1998, Behring shot and killed an elephant in Mozambique, where the sport killing of elephants was banned in 1990. His hunting companions, the then past and current presidents of Safari Club International, killed two more elephants. Mozambican wildlife officials believed that the group had come \\"to survey investment opportunities\\" in Cabo Delgado province. The group was given a permit by the governor to shoot a lion, a leopard, and a buffalo; a local wildlife official also added a note referring to \\"problem elephants\\", the only exception to the national ban on the killing of elephants. According to Arlito Cuco, head of Mozambique's wildlife service, a federal investigation showed that the hunt was illegal because it did not target problem elephants, and that two of the elephant tusks had gone missing. Local investigators also reported that the group used a helicopter during the hunt, which \\"drove the elephants onto their guns\\"—a charge they denied. According to the New York Times, Behring's spokesperson \\"sent a reporter a copy of a $5,000 check, dated six weeks after the hunt and made out to the provincial government with the notation 'elephant permit.'\\" The then-director of the game reserve near where the elephants had been killed was skeptical, telling ABC News PrimeTime, \\"They came in there and bankrolled an operation to take out some big elephant, and it is wrong. And nobody, nobody can condone what happened.\\" SCI was founded by trophy hunter C.J. McElroy, who claimed to be the greatest trophy hunter in the world. McElroy hunted in nearly 50 countries, on six continents. He killed nearly 400 trophy animals that appear in SCI's record book, including animals that are now endangered and can no longer be hunted. McElroy was forced to resign in 1988. Bill Quimby, a past president of SCI, writes in his book Safari Club International that rumors were passed among hunters that McElroy \\"ignored hunting laws\\", that McElroy was even accused of killing a Rocky Mountain bighorn ram in a national park, and that his \\"ideas of sportsmanship and ethics simply were different from those of hunters who came along later.\\" Cecil the lion Cecil the lion was a lion that lived primarily in the Hwange National Park in Matabeleland North, Zimbabwe. He was a major attraction at the park and was being studied and tracked by the University of Oxford as part of a larger study. He was initially wounded with an arrow by Walter Palmer, an American dentist and SCI member, then tracked, and reportedly killed with a rifle about 40 hours later on 1 July 2015. Palmer says that Cecil was killed with a bow and arrow in much less than 40 hours after the lion was first wounded. Following outcry over the killing, Palmer's SCI membership was suspended. Charges against Palmer were eventually dropped by the Zimbabwean Government. Revenue sources For the tax year ending June 2006, SCI reported $2.87 million in revenue from SCI publications; $3.17 million in membership dues; $205,967 in interest on savings and temporary investments; $75,771 from sales of assets other than inventory; $6.86 million from special events such as the annual convention; $156,014 from sales of inventory; and $6,089 miscellaneous income. In 2007, the New York legislature earmarked $50,000 of public funds for SCI.

History  The software was available for both Windows and Macintosh. Early versions for Windows were 16-bit, Cinemania 96 had both 16-bit and 32-bit EXEs for compatibility with Windows 3.1 and native Windows 95 support respectively. The last edition of Cinemania was released in 1997 and is the only purely 32-bit version. This version was supported on Windows 95 or Windows NT, or Apple Macintoshes running System 7. Melinda Gates, wife of Bill Gates, worked on the development of this software in the early 1990s.  Content  The software was mainly a database of films, in a similar fashion to the Internet Movie Database, and gave descriptions of the films and who starred in them. Most of this information was not readily accessible before broadband internet. Cinemania contained professional material by: * Leonard Maltin: 19,000 reviews from his Movie and Video Guide * Roger Ebert: over 1300 reviews from his Video Companion (starting from the 2nd edition, published as Cinemania '94) * Pauline Kael: 2500 reviews from her 5001 Nights at the movies book (also starting with Cinemania '94) * Baseline: The Motion Picture Guide and The Encyclopedia of Film * James Monaco: How to Read a Film * Ephraim Katz: The Film Encyclopedia The program also included over 2000 still images for movies and actors, a large number of sound clips, dialogues and soundtracks, and a smaller selection of full-motion video clips. As the amount of material increased with each new edition, the quality of media tended to decrease, in order to fit everything on a single CD-ROM. Cinemania 97 also had guided tours from numerous celebrities and online features which made use of an associated MSN website. It could be updated monthly over the Internet, which brought new movies, new material about older movies and new celebrity tours.

Though he was not an original member, he was regarded as being integral to the group's sound. He played the vibraphone, flute, piano, synthesizers and occasional drums, and he was with the band from late 1969 until late 1972. Palmer originally played in a group called The Hellions, which featured future Traffic members Jim Capaldi and Dave Mason, Jim and Poli later formed Deep Feeling, which also included future Spooky Tooth member Luther Grosvenor. Palmer was briefly involved later with acts such as the Blossom Toes, Bakerloo and Ian Matthews' Southern Comfort, formed by the former Fairport Convention frontman of that name. He was in the folk rock band Eclection with whom he performed at the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival, before joining Family. Palmer replaced Jim King in Family and immediately went to work on the group's third album, A Song For Me. Many of that album's songs had to be re-arranged, as they were written with King's saxophone and harmonica in mind. Palmer rose to the challenge, transforming songs with his different instruments. \\"Drowned in Wine\\" became a full-blown rocker with his overamplified flute, and his vibraphones added a jazz touch to the blues number \\"Love Is a Sleeper.\\" A Song For Me was released in January 1970 to rave reviews, and Family seemed re-invigorated by Palmer's arrival. Palmer contributed to the next two Family albums, Anyway and Fearless. On the latter album, released in 1971, Palmer contributed the jazz instrumental \\"Crinkly Grin\\" and the song \\"Larf and Sing,\\" which he sang lead on himself. After 1972's Bandstand and a U.S. tour as the warmup act for Elton John, Palmer left Family to form a group with fellow Family alumnus Ric Grech and Mitch Mitchell, but that effort never got anywhere. Palmer's other credits include work on two albums from British soul singer Linda Lewis, 1972's Lark and 1973's Fathoms Deep. He also has worked with Peter Frampton, and Elkie Brooks, he made guest appearances on albums from the post-Family band Streetwalkers and on solo albums from former Family lead singer Roger Chapman. Palmer contributed tuned percussion on Pete Townshend's 1982 solo album All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes. He wrote the music for the rock opera Hero, produced in 1976 by the Australian Opera in Sydney. In 1985, Palmer released Human Error, a solo record featuring King Crimson and Bad Company alumnus Boz Burrell and Mel Collins also of King Crimson fame. It featured the Fairlight CMI synthesizer extensively and was recorded in Burrell's studio. In 1986, he produced and provided Fairlight programming to the Kevin Ayers release As Close as You Think, recorded at the same studio. In recent years, Palmer has split time between gigging and music computer work.

Since the program's start in Kansas City, Missouri, in the year 2000 with an enrollment of about 3000 students, Summer Adventure has greatly expanded in Missouri, and the state's student enrollment in the program reached 50,000 in the summer of 2005. Summer Adventure was offered in eleven other states in that same year. Curriculum Summer Adventure offers programs at four different age levels: *Kinderventure! Kids, kindergarten *Adventure Scouts Kids, grades 1-3 *Explorers Kids, grades 4-5 *Voyagers Kids, grades 6-8 Students grades 9-12 may take high school courses during the summer, either to make up courses they have previously failed or to obtain advancement credits. For K-8 participants, each session of Summer Adventure lasts two weeks, and the school day is six hours long. Participants take \\"Core Program\\" classes in the morning and two \\"Adventure Electives\\" classes in the afternoon. The program aims to integrate fun and learning to attract students. Sample courses include robotics, theater, aeronautics, movie making, and physical science. According to the Newton Summer Adventure Website, \\"The hands-on activities promote conceptual learning and problem-solving skills, attributes which are shown to lead to increased academic performance in school. In district-sponsored programs where the Adventure includes a pre-and-post assessment, achievement gains of near 50% have been recorded.\\" The Columbia school district independently confirmed that Summer Adventure resulted in improved reading test scores for participants. Summer Adventure is district-funded and free for all students. Controversies School districts pay Newton Learning to run Summer Adventure and boost summer attendance rates, which in turn generate state aid and a profit for the districts. In order to encourage enrollment and attendance, Newton offers Visa debit cards to students with good attendance during the summer school session. The debit card balances range from $100 for perfect attendance to $50 for 14 hours missed. In Columbia, Missouri, 3,637 students received debit cards in the 2005 summer session. Depending on the district, Summer Adventure also holds drawings for daily incentives and gift cards, as well as bigger prizes like the Xbox 360. The incentives have been controversial. Many parents prefer to enroll their children in programs that do not offer such incentives. Others object to the idea of private companies running public education. Rep. Maynard Wallace, a Missouri legislator, attempted in December 2004 to pass a bill blocking school districts from using Newton Learning and other for-profit companies to gain state aid. \\"We’re taking taxpayer money that would be going to educate our children, and it’s going to a company. It’s going to a corporation that’s doing this for profit,\\" Wallace said. Clay Routledge, a doctoral student in psychology, commented that monetary reinforcements for summer school would decrease intrinsic motivation for learning. Busing problems in Columbia in the summer of 2004 also raised criticisms. The problems have since been largely resolved.

Cuentos, oraciones, adivinas y refranes populares e infantiles. Leipzig: Brockhaus. 1878. pp. 31-43. Andrew Lang included it in The Orange Fairy Book. Synopsis A fisherman found two beautiful children in a crystal cradle, a girl and a boy, floating in the river and brought them to his wife to raise as their own. As the babies grew up, their older brothers were cruel to them and the boy and the girl often ran away to the riverbank, where they would feed breadcrumbs to the birds. In gratitude, the birds taught them to speak their language. One day the oldest boy taunted them with having no parents, and so the boy and girl went out into the world to seek their fortunes. When they stopped to rest along their journey, they heard birds gossiping, and one bird said that the king had married the youngest daughter of a tailor, over the opposition of the nobles. He was obliged to go to war, and when he returned, he was told that his wife had given birth to twins who had died. Missing her babies, the queen went mad, and had to be shut up in a tower in the mountains where the fresh air might restore her. In fact, the babies had not really died, but were taken to a gardener's cottage, and that night the chamberlain threw them into the river in a crystal cradle, which the children recognized from the story of how the fisherman had found them. The bird went on to say that only the Bird of Truth could convince the king that the children were really his children, and the bird was kept by a giant who only slept a quarter-hour a day in the castle of Come-and-never-go. Only a witch could tell the way to the castle, and she would not do it unless she was given the water from the fountain of many colours. Furthermore, the Bird of Truth is surrounded by the Birds of ill Faith, and only an owl could tell which one was which. They went to the city, where they begged hospitality for a night, and were so helpful that the innkeeper asked them to stay. The girl did, but her brother left on his quest. A dove directed him to go with the wind, and by following it, he reached the witch's tower and asked the way to the castle of Come-and-never-go. The witch tried to get him to stay the night, but when he refused, demanded a jug of the many-colored waters, or she would turn him into a lizard. She then directed a dog to lead him to the water. At the castle, he heard the owl's cry and asked its advice. It told him to fill the jug from another fountain and then find the white bird in the corner, not the brightly colored birds. He had a quarter of an hour to do the task, and succeeded. When he brought back the water, the witch threw it over him and told him to become a parrot, but he became more handsome, and all the creatures about the hut threw themselves into the water and became human again. The witch fled. The courtiers who were responsible for abandoning the children tried to prevent the King from learning about the children, but they talked so much of it that he overheard the commotion and became curious. When the bird flew to him, he listened. The King at once went to embrace his children, and then all three of them freed his wife, their mother, from the tower. The wicked courtiers had their heads cut off, and the couple who had raised them were given riches and honor.De Faber, Cecilia Böhl, and Robert M.

This stake was resold to System Capital Management of Ukrainian oligarch Rinat Akhmetov. Ukrtelecom participates in ITUR, TEL/ТАЕ, and BSFOCS international cable systems. Until 1994, the company was known as Ukrelectrozvyazok (). History Ukrtelecom's first and previous logo, used from 19 August 1991 to 31 August 2009. When Ukrtelecom were established, it got its own launch logo that had lasted in 18 years, until the rebranding from 2009. The company was created from the Soviet network of communication only in 1993, however, the network itself came under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications in 1991 after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. According to the company's history, the phone-telegraph communication network in Ukraine prior to 1991 was only sixth within the Soviet Union and was noticeably backward. All communications outside the Soviet Union was conducted through the Moscow's headquarters. In 1991 there were 7,630 thousands numbers listed, averaging 14.6 numbers for 100 residents. In 1993, the government confirmed the complex program for creation the single national system of communication in Ukraine. For the purpose of more effective managing of the industry it was fully reorganized. Based on the government enterprises two main industrial unions were created: Ukrposhta and Ukrelektrozviazok. The latter was changed in 1994 to Ukrtelekom. Ukrtelekom upon its creation consisted of seven enterprises and organizations: Ukrtek (Ukrainian enterprise of international and intercity communication and television), Kyiv telegraph, Kyiv city radio broadcasting network, Center of informational technologies, State Institutes \\"Ukrzviazokproekt\\", \\"Dniprozviazok\\", \\"Zakarpattelekom\\". In January 1995 to Ukrtelekom were merged other 22 oblast networks as well as the Crimean republican and Sevastopol city communication enterprises. And by the end of the year \\"Ukrzviazoksuputnyk\\" was also added to the union. By January 1996 the union absorbed the last enterprise \\"Dniportelekom\\". The union, however, was not as effective as it was thought it should have been and in 1998 Ukrtelekom was restructured to form a single entity out of the union of some 35 state enterprises. By the end of 1999 all the enterprises were reformed into stock associates of the Ukrtelekom company. In 2009, Ukrtelecom introduced a new logo for the first time of 18 years since 1991, and were at the same time changing its corporate identity. It was reported that the rebranding cost an estimated $100,000 and was ordered in Britain. The Ukrainian government planned to privatize the company as early as March 2009. On October 12, 2010 the first Azarov government announced the date and starting price for selling Ukrtelecom. Bidding took place on December 28, 2010 with the starting price of all government shares at 10.5 billion hryvnias. \\"Dilo\\" (October 13, 2010) Companies with over 25% of shares owned by government or government establishment were announced not eligible for the bidding.

The name comes from Afrikaans vel (\\"skin\\"), later assimilated with veld (\\"field\\"), and skoene (\\"shoes\\").

Easy to make, lightweight and extremely tough, vellies became part of South African, Zimbabwean (previously Rhodesian) and Namibian society, worn by all classes and professions, often without socks, but favoured by students, farmers and safari guides. Nathan Clark's shoe company, C&J; Clark, made the desert boot famous, modeled after the same round toe and style of veldskoens.

He made his debut in the premier NASCAR series in 1989, running one race at Sonoma in a car owned by his father. He put the No. 93 Taco Bell Buick into the field in 32nd. From there, he completed all but two laps en route to a 24th. Beebe would run four races in the series in 1990, switching between his family-owned car and those owned by D.K. Ulrich. He could not top his '89 running, only managing a best finish of 30th at Sonoma. His other three finishes were 37th, 31st and 35th. However, he did record his best career start at Michigan, starting in the 28th slot. Busch Series Beebe moved his team to the Busch Series, where they ran 23 races in 1991. He made his debut in the No. 9 Taco Bell car at Richmond, where he put his car in the field in 31st. He would finish that race 24th. The very next race at Martinsville, Beebe managed an 11th place, and shortly afterwards, he earned his season-best qualifying effort of 4th at Hickory. Beebe was more consistent at the end of the year, topping off eleven top-20s in the year with his first career top-10, a 10th-place finish at IRP. It was the highlight of the year that ended with Beebe 22nd in points. Beebe only managed fourteen starts in 1992, racing his No. 24 Banana Boat Ford. In those starts, Beebe struggled. His best finish of the year was a 15th at Daytona and his only other top-20 finishes were a pair of 16ths. This could largely be explained by seven DNFs, meaning he did not finish half his starts. Beebe only managed eight more starts in 1993, once again with poor results. His best finish was a 17th place at Orange County. He failed to finish five races that season. As a result, Beebe only attempted one race in 1994. He managed a 39th place start at Dover, and finished in 32nd after an engine change. Beebe only ran two races in 1995, which would be the final time he would run a Busch race. He was 36th at Darlington and 43rd at Rockingham. He crashed out of both events and then moved to the Craftsman Truck Series. Craftsman Truck Series Beebe started the inaugural season in 1995, running the No. 10 Chevy at Phoenix, starting 24th and finishing 30th.

On December 1, 2007, the convent announced that some of the trees would be cut down due to poor health, falling limbs, and the convent's inability to afford the annual maintenance. It was rumored that a private donor from Ft. Thomas, Kentucky, offered to pay the annual cost and prevent the trees from being cut down. Nevertheless, all of the trees were cut down. However, new trees were planted beside the old ones in 2008 and the hope is that one day they stand as tall as the old trees.

The site chosen was in the South Docklands (SODO) campshires, at the corner of Sir John Rogerson's Quay and Britain Quay, by the confluence of the River Liffey, the River Dodder, and the Grand Canal. The design announced on 12 October 2007 was by Foster and Partners. Its height had been reported at 120 metres, \\"well over 120 metres\\", and 180 metres, any of which would have made it the tallest building on the island of Ireland. The building was planned to be an apartment building, with a recording studio owned by the rock group U2 in a \\"pod\\" at the top. Construction was to begin in 2008 and end in 2011, at a cost of €200m. In October 2008, the project was cancelled because of the economic downturn at the time. Proposals to revive the plan were reported in July 2013. However, they did not come to fruition and the 79-metre, 22-storey Capital Dock development has since been built on the site. History The construction site at Britain Quay, June 2009 Site being cleared for construction in February 2008 The Dublin Docklands Development Authority (DDDA) was established in 1997 to regenerate the brownfield sites and underused warehouses in the Docklands at the mouth of the River Liffey in Dublin. In 2000, the DDDA proposed a landmark tower for the Britain Quay site. The involvement of U2 was part of a deal in 2001 when the DDDA had acquired by compulsory purchase the site of U2's previous studio on Hanover Quay. In October 2002, the DDDA announced an architectural design competition for the tower, initially to be 60 metres tall, which would house apartments and a penthouse recording studio for U2. 530 entries were received from around the world by the closing date in February 2003. The judging panel was not revealed till after the winner was announced. It included the president of the Royal Hibernian Academy, the chairman and two other members of the DDDA, Dublin's City Architect, and Adam Clayton of U2. The panel initially chose as the winner an entry which was later disqualified after legal advice because the DDDA had lost the details of which firm had submitted the design and so were unable to notify the winner. The Sunday Times later speculated that it might have been one by London practice 3W, after a campaign by Irish website archiseek.com led to six unidentified designs being located. On 5 August 2003, the winning design announced was by architects Burdon Dunne/Craig Henry (now BCDH Architects) of Blackrock, Dublin. Felim Dunne, the senior partner in Burdon Dunne, was the brother-in-law of U2's manager Paul McGuinness. The tower's stated height was 60 metres to the parapet, but 78 metres to the pinnacle of the glass screening device. In September 2005, the DDDA revised the height of the U2 tower from 60 metres to 120 metres. This was in conjunction with the also-cancelled construction of the 120-metre Watchtower in the Point Village complex on the north bank of the Liffey, opposite the U2 tower. The DDDA envisaged the two towers forming a \\"landmark entry\\" and \\"visual gatepost\\" for the city from Dublin Port. Minister for the Environment Dick Roche approved the DDDA's plans in July 2006. The DDDA applied for planning permission for the U2 tower on 14 September 2006. This application further increased the height of the tower to 130m. The provisions of Section 25 of the DDDA Act, 1997 were used to fast-track the application. It was approved on 2 October 2006. Tenders for construction of the tower were invited and a shortlist of five firms was published on 26 February 2007. The winning bid announced on 12 October 2007 was from Geranger, a consortium of property developers and the members of U2. The design selected was not the original BCDH design, but rather one commissioned by Geranger from Norman Foster. The bids were assessed by a panel of three architects. The runner-up was also a new design, by Zaha Hadid. On 31 October 2008, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority announced that they were cancelling the construction plans due to the economic conditions at the time. On 25 November 2011, it was announced that U2 Tower land had been handed over to the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) to settle debts. Problems Developers Dunloe Ewart (subsequently taken over by Liam Carroll) had secured planning permission in 2000 for a 100-metre building on a site next to that of the U2 tower. The DDDA objected to this in 2005 as it wanted the U2 tower to be an isolated landmark. Dublin City Council refused to extend planning permission on Carroll's undeveloped site after it expired. In September 2007, Carroll appealed this in the Commercial Court. Some residents of Ringsend accused the DDDA of \\"arrogance\\", claiming that extra revenue from two towers could fund social housing schemes in nearby areas. Others expressed discontent at the presence of a skyscraper in a historically low-rise area. Concerns were expressed about a possible conflict of interest for U2 in the building tender process, when it emerged that the band were joint backers of Geranger. After the original BCDH bid's success, it was pointed out that U2 manager Paul McGuinness is the brother-in-law of BCDH architect Felim Dunne. The impact of the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis brought doubts on the viability of the BCDH design. Journalists speculated that the extra engineering expense of the complicated \\"twisting tower\\" design was excessive, and that an alternative design would be used instead. Construction tenders were able to submit price quotations for both the original BCDH design and an alternative of their own choosing. Delays at all stages of the design and planning phases were commented upon. The estimated cost and completion date later moved from €55m and early 2008 in September 2006 to €200m and late 2011 in October 2007. Design The predicted price of a 2-bed apartment in the tower was estimated in October 2006 at €1–1.5 million. BCDH design Design on the surrounding hoarding of the site in January 2011 The BCDH design had a 45-degree twist, half the 90-degree twist of the Turning Torso in Malmö. It had a shoulder height of 100m, to the top floor of apartments, and a pinnacle height of 130m, including a service level and the two-storey penthouse recording studio. There were a total of 36 storeys. The footprint was a 26.6m square. The building was primarily to consist of one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments, with commercial premises on the ground and first floors, a two-level basement parking garage, and the penthouse. The dramatic twisting geometry of the tower posed a significant structural engineering challenge, resolved using a column structure of inclined columns following the twist of the building and the stiff circular core for torsional stability. 26.6 m² floor plates twist by an equal amount per storey about the circular core, housing lifts and services risers as well as a double-deck lift for service/firefighting and penthouse access. Foster design The design chosen on 12 October 2007 was a tilted triangle. It had mainly luxury apartments, with a public viewing platform at 100m, just below an acoustically-insulated egg-shaped pod containing the U2 recording studio. Above this was to be an \\"energy centre\\" containing wind turbines and a large solar panel. The east and west facades were crinkled in the manner of fish scales, with concealed balconies. The north facade would have been sleek, while the south facade had further solar panels. The building would have straddled the end of Sir John Rogerson's quay, allowing traffic to pass through its base. Environs A five star hotel was planned to be located adjacent to the tower, with a block of 34 social and affordable apartments. A bridge for pedestrians and public transport would have crossed the Dodder/Grand Canal mouth outside the tower, as a continuation of Sir John Rogerson's Quay towards the East Link Bridge. This was designed by UK consultants Flint & Neill. Kennedy-Wilson proposal It was reported in July 2013 that Kennedy-Wilson, an American firm, was planning to buy the site off NAMA and develop an 18-story U2 Tower, half the height of the earlier plan. This plan was later cancelled, being replaced by the 79-metre, 22-storey Capital Dock development which currently stands on the site.

The community was named after the local gold-mining industry. Gold Point is the southern terminus of Nevada State Route 774. History The area that would become Gold Point was first settled by ranchers and a few miners during the 1880s. The small camp of Lime Point was formed a few hundred yards west of the present town, at an outcropping of limestone. When new discoveries of gold and silver established the major mining towns of Tonopah and Goldfield, Nevada in the early 1900s, a flood of prospectors returned to Lime Point. In 1902 silver was discovered in the area, and the old camp was revived and renamed Hornsilver (an informal name for the silver mineral chlorargyrite). Scarcity of water in the area required that the ore be shipped to nearby Lida for milling. The nearest major supply town was about 250 miles north at Unionville, a mining town northeast of present-day Lovelock. The miners did not find silver in abundance, the costs of shipping the ore to Lida became too high, and, within a year, the settlement was abandoned. In 1905, the Great Western Mine Company began operations about a half mile southeast of Hornsilver and discovered a rich silver vein which brought a stampede of miners back to the camp. In addition to the rich silver ore, gold was also mined in small quantities. By 1908, the tent homes turned into more permanent wooden structures and the camp became a town. In May, 1908 the Hornsilver Herald began publication and the following week a post office was established. Before long the residents organized a chamber of commerce and numerous businesses sprouted up, including as many as 13 saloons. The chamber sought a railroad extension to Hornsilver, but this never happened. The nearest railroad depot was at Ralston, about 15 miles east of Hornsilver. As deep ore bodies were extensively developed, the town peaked at a population of around 1,000 with over 225 wood-framed buildings, tents and shacks throughout the camp. Gold Point - abandoned building and car, October 2009 The town’s original founders did not find the boomtown they had hoped for, as this strike also proved to be short-lived. In 1909, litigation due to claim jumping brought many of the area mining properties into the courts. These many lawsuits, along with inefficient and costly milling practices, halted the town’s growth just a little more than a year after it was established. Before long, most of its businesses closed and its residents again moved on. But Hornsilver was not yet a ghost town, as mining operations resumed again in 1915. However, it must not have done very well as Charles Stoneham, of the New York Giants baseball team, purchased the Great Western mine in 1922 at a receiver’s sale. Buildings in the center of town in 2009 In 1927, a miner by the name of J.W. Dunfee went down the mine and made an even better discovery – gold. Within a few years, more gold than silver was being mined and the town’s name was changed to Gold Point. It was after this discovery that Gold Point enjoyed its longest period of success, at a time that the rest of America was suffering from depression. However, when World War II began, the government ordered all gold mines to shut down as nonessential to the war effort. Mining at Gold Point stopped, and once again most of its residents drifted away or went off to war. After the war, mining resumed on a smaller scale and continued until the 1960s when a cave-in occurred from a dynamite blast at the Dunfee Shaft. More expensive to fix than the quantity and value of ore extracted would pay, the mine closed. Other than a few small leases and diggings, this was the last serious mining operation at Gold Point. Town buildings giving a sense of the isolation of Gold Point The old camp is a living history lesson with about 50 buildings still standing, including former Senator Harry Wiley's home and the post office that now serves as a museum. The Post Office Museum is open on most weekends and for large parties. Memorial Day Weekend is the annual Chili Cook-Off with prizes and drawings, food and drink, games and live music all day and through the night. For a few days of the year, the population soars to 400, but is usually seven. Gold Point is home to the High Desert Drifters Western Historical Society; the club routinely performs western reenactment and gunfights in the plaza. Guest services are available year round, including electric hook-ups for RVs. Nearby nature sites include waterfalls and watering holes frequented by wild horses and burros, Indian petroglyphs, fossils, petrified woods, and a view of Death Valley National Park from Big Molly.

It is the only Floorless Coaster in Pennsylvania and was opened on May 7, 2005. Hydra was built on the site of the former wooden roller coaster Hercules, which was closed and demolished at the end of the park's 2003 season. Its name comes from the Greek Mythology story where Hercules battled the Hydra. History Site preparation began in late 2003, when on September 1, 2003, Hercules, a wooden roller coaster that sat in the current location of Hydra the Revenge, was closed and demolished. On September 14, 2004, the $13 million Hydra the Revenge was announced. Construction began in the spring of 2004 and continued through the winter. Hydra the Revenge was topped off (highest piece of the lift hill) on August 20, 2004 and the entire track layout was completed on December 4, 2004. The first cars for the coaster arrived at Dorney Park on December 10, 2004 and the first ride with people on a train took place on March 24, 2005. The roller coaster officially opened to the public on May 7, 2005. Backstory The name of the roller coaster comes from the story of Hercules in Greek Mythology. According to the story, Hercules had to perform twelve labours. After defeating the Nemean lion for the first labour, the second was to defeat the Hydra, a nine-headed creature with eight serpentine heads that would regrow each time they were cut off, including one that was immortal. Dorney Park altered the remainder of the story — after Hercules managed to defeat the Hydra initially, he could not kill the immortal head, so he instead buried it deep underground and beneath a giant stone, with the intention of sealing it for all time. Many years later however, the head slowly grew back the rest of its body, resurrecting the Hydra and taking its revenge on Hercules by killing him; hence why the Hydra roller coaster sits where Hercules once did. Ride experience heartline roll Once the floor drops and the front gate opens, the train is dispatched leading straight into the first inversion; a heartline roll, nicknamed the \\"Jojo Roll\\". Upon exiting the roll, the train makes a 180 degree right turn and begins to climb the lift hill. Once at the top, the train drops down at a 68 degree angle. Then, the train makes a slight right turn into a inclined diving loop before going through a zero-gravity roll. Next, immediately after the roll, the train enters the first of two corkscrews. After exiting the corkscrew, the train then goes through a cobra roll. After an upward left turn, followed by a downard right turn, the train goes over an airtime hill before entering the second corkscrew. The train then makes a 360 degree left turn, followed by a banked 90-degree right turn which leads into the final brake run and back into the station. One cycle of the ride lasts about 2 minutes and 35 seconds. Characteristics Trains Hydra the Revenge operates with two steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has eight cars that can seat four riders in a single row for a total of 32 riders per train. Each train has two shades of green and pink on the bottom section while the seats and over-the-shoulder restraints are also pink. Each seat has an over-the- shoulder harness with an interlocking seatbelt. The trains have no floor as the riders' legs can dangle above the track. Track The steel track of Hydra the Revenge is approximately long, the height of the lift is approximately high and the entire track weighs about . It was manufactured by Clermont Steel Fabricators located in Batavia, Ohio. The track has two shades of green while the supports are turquoise. Reception Jeremy Thompson from Roller Coaster Philosophy said that \\"the ride itself is okay, but I’m not sure if I really loved the whole experience.\\", but that \\"still, it’s got a more interesting layout.\\" A group of roller coaster enthusiasts also came to the conclusion that the ride wasn't the best but still good, \\"The general consensus is that it's a good, but not quite great, ride that's perfect for family-oriented Dorney.\\" References External links * Hydra the Revenge's official page Greco-Roman mythology in popular culture Roller coasters introduced in 2005 Roller coasters operated by Cedar Fair Roller coasters in Pennsylvania Floorless Coaster roller coasters manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard ","title":"Hydra the Revenge"},{"id":"5791731","text":"Dhankar Gompa Gate Prayer flags in Dhankar Dhankar Gompa (also Dankhar, Drangkhar or Dhangkar Gompa; Brang-mkhar or Grang-mkhar) is a village and also a Gompa, a Buddhist temple in the district of Lahaul and Spiti in India. It is situated at an elevation of 3,894 metres (12,774 feet) in the Spiti Valley above Dhankar Village, between the towns of Kaza and Tabo. The complex is built on a 1000-foot (300-metre) high spur overlooking the confluence of the Spiti and Pin Rivers - one of the world's most spectacular settings for a gompa. Dhang or dang means cliff, and kar or khar means fort. Hence Dhangkar means fort on a cliff. Dhankar, like Key Monastery and Tangyud Monastery in Spiti, and Thiksey, Likir and Rangdum monasteries in Ladakh, was built as a fort monastery on the Central Tibetan pattern. It was reported to have had 90 monks in 1855.Handa (1987), pp. 131, 149. Overview Below the Gompa lies the small village of Shichilling which contains the new Dhankar Monastery, home to about 150 monks belonging to the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism. Beyond the surrounding harsh, lunar landscape, notable sights at Dhankar Gompa include a statue of Vairocana consisting of four figures seated back-to-back, in addition to various crumbling thangkas. There is a small museum in the gompa. In 2006, World Monuments Fund selected Dhankar gompa as one of the 100 most endangered sites in the world. A nonprofit group, Dhangkar Initiative, is attempting to organize its conservation. Dhankar is approachable by a motorable road, good for small vehicles only, that branches off for Dhankar from the main Kaza-Samdu road at a point around 24 km from Kaza. The branch road is 8 km in length up to Dhankar. History Dhankar was the traditional capital of the Spiti Valley Kingdom during the 17th century and has some features dating back to the 12th century. It was the seat of the early rulers of Spiti, the Nonos, who had the right to cultivate the government lands nearby and were required to keep the fort in repair. They also dispensed justice to the people and were noted for their harsh penalties until the British replaced them.Kapidia (1999), pp. 76-79.

It lies along State Route 265, south of U.S. Route 6 and west of Goldfield, the county seat of Esmeralda County.Rand McNally. The Road Atlas '08. Chicago: Rand McNally, 2008, p. 64. It has a post office, with the ZIP code of 89047.Zip Code Lookup The population of Silver Peak was 115 as of 2018. Economy Silver Peak lies near a dry lake bed that is rich in lithium and other minerals. Initially, salt was mined in the area. In 1906, Spurr reported that salt was mined for local use by digging a hole a foot or two deep until water was reached and then waiting until the water evaporated. It was claimed that the salt produced in this manner was 99% pure. During World War II, Clayton Marsh was explored for strategic minerals including potash and American Potash Corp. leased the marsh. In the 1950s, Leprechaun Mining (Clyde Kegel) picked up the leases and determined that in addition to potassium, lithium was present. Leprechaun Mining reached an agreement with Foote Minerals in 1964 and Foote reconfigured the silver mill and started production of lithium in 1967. In 1988, Cyprus Minerals acquired Foote and became Cyprus Foot Minerals. In 1998, Chemetall acquired the operation - the new company was called Chemetall Foote Corp. In 2004, Rockwood Holdings acquired the operation. In 2010, the mine was expanded to double the capacity of its lithium carbonate production. The project was funded in part by a $28.4 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to expand and upgrade the production of lithium materials for advanced transportation batteries., In 2014, the Albemarle Corporation purchased Rockwood for $6.2 Billion. As of February 2019, the Albemarle Corporation Lithium Operation at Silver Peak is currently the only operating source of lithium in the United States. The community gained some fame during California's 1999 electric power crisis. In the first major act of the power crisis causing an outage, on March 25, 1999, Enron energy traders allegedly rerouted 2,900MW (megawatts) of electricity destined for California to this small Nevada community. This caused a large shortage on the California power grid because the largest power feeder (intertie) from this area to California had a capacity of 15MW (about 0.5% of the required wheeling capacity). News accounts claim this single action created an estimated $7 million of revenue for Enron. The company was fined $25,000 for their action, suggesting to some that this was a viable way for the firm to make money. History Silver Peak is one of the oldest mining communities in Nevada.

History Coal was discovered near Coaldale in 1894 by William Groszenger who sold 150 tons to the Columbus Marsh Borax works. In 1911, the Darms Mine and the Nevada Coal and Fuel Co. mines were in operation. Coal was found 4 miles SSE of Coaldale in the north end of the Silver Peak Range. In the early 1900s, there was renewed interest in the coal, when Dr. Frances Williams of Goldfield, Nevada personally restaked claims. At the time, Groezenger retained the majority of the claims. In November, 1917, the Darms Mining Company asked the Nevada Railroads Commission to secure a rate of $3/ton to deliver coal from Coaldale to Reno. The Tonopah and Goldfield Railroad replied that while they had grave doubts about the value of the coal, they offered two plans: 1) where one or two cars would be transported to Tonopah, Goldfield and Reno and if the coal was usable, then a rate would be established for future shipments, or 2) a temporary rate of $6.35/ton would be used, which was the Reno to Coaldale rate. In February, 1918, Darms replied that the seam was too small to take advantage of either offer. In the 1940s, Eldon and Jewel Parson operated a gas station near the Tonopah and Goldfield Railroad grade. They later moved their operation about to the junction with Highway 95. The restaurant and bar buildings were part of a hospital in Tonopah and trucked to Coaldale. Includes 1974 photo from the Central Nevada Museum. Coaldale had a store, cafe, motel and service station as late as 1993, but they are now abandoned, though still standing. Residences and other buildings have disappeared. The service station was closed down due to EPA testing in 1993 that found that its underground fuel tanks were leaking. Soon, the restaurant and motel closed, since the service station was the primary attraction for travelers. At some point before 2006, a fire destroyed the restaurant. Trivia In 1994, the movie The Stranger was filmed at Coaldale. The Stranger features Kathy Long, female kickboxing champion, who battles bikers and saves the town.

It was operated by Tranz Scenic. The service was replaced from 25 June 2012, by the Northern Explorer. The Overlander replaced a previous service operated by RM class Silver Fern railcars on Monday 2 December 1991. Following the withdrawal of the overnight Northerner, it was the only regular passenger train on the NIMT between Pukekohe and Palmerston North. After being threatened with cessation itself in 2006, it gained significantly in popularity, partly because of increased tourism promotion for the service. It was called one of the best-value scenic rail trips in the world by the British Guardian. It is also acknowledged as one of the world's classic scenic rail journeys. Route History Origins The first regular daylight Wellington-Auckland passenger train services, augmenting the older overnight services, were the steam-hauled Daylight Limited and diesel-hauled Scenic Daylight that ran primarily during summer months and Easter holiday period for many years from the 1920s onwards. The arrival of the Blue Streak and later Silver Fern railcars saw an end for a time to regular carriage trains, except when the Silver Fern railcars were replaced by carriage trains. Proposed cessation On 25 July 2006, it was announced that the service would be withdrawn at the end of September as it had made a loss for some time. The last trains were scheduled to run on Saturday 30 September 2006. On 18 August 2006, the Green Party announced a Save the Overlander campaign, which received a positive response, primarily from the small towns along the train's route. On 28 September 2006, three days before the service was due to end, Toll announced that it would continue on a schedule reduced from daily year-round to Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays in the off-peak winter season, and daily in the peak summer and Easter period. New life DC class locomotive 4093 on the Overlander at National Park. The Overlander's reprieve saw an interim refurbishment programme implemented, both internally and externally. Externally, the three former Bay Express cars and seven existing Overlander cars retained the Cato blue paint scheme of the Tranz Rail era, but with the new \\"Overlander\\" promotional logo introduced by Toll Rail on the sides in large white letters. Also, structural repair work was carried out. Internally, the cars were tidied up and seats replaced or reupholstered in some cars, new carpet laid in others. In 2008, the train was again close to capacity in usage of its just over 160 seats, and it was mooted that daily services be reestablished. After the New Zealand government re-purchased the rail services in 2008 and renamed them KiwiRail, a rail upgrade budget was also announced that included funds for refurbishing the trains. In mid-2009, it was announced that patronage had steadily increased and that the service was thriving with 25.5% more passengers over the previous year, and that additional carriages had been added to the train in some cases to satisfy demand. KiwiRail also announced that as a result, services would be extended to daily during the July school holidays, and the general peak season timetable extended to more than seven months each year. The service then became seven days a week from September through to May, with the winter off peak May to September being Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Due to increased interest and passenger demand, the town of Taihape was reinstated in October 2009 as a stop on the Overlander, following the local \\"Stop the Train\\" co-operative petition, headed by the Taihape Community Development Trust, Taihape Community Board, and the Older and Bolder Groups. Today with the Northern Explorer service, Taihape is no longer a stop.  Re-branding as the Northern Explorer  In 2012, passenger numbers were again in decline. KiwiRail decided to replace the Overlander with a new service, the Northern Explorer, from Monday, 25 June 2012. Rolling stock The Overlander was usually hauled by DC or EF locomotives with NZR 56-foot carriages. Originally the service was operated with six Northerner cars (originally single lavatory first class cars, later designated South Island Main Trunk first class cars, refurbished for the original Southerner Expresses of 1970), the Bay Express servery/observation/rear-view car, and what was once both The Connoisseur car and TranzAlpine rear-view/observation car and the two Northerner modular handbrake end-mounted 11 kW generator FM -class power-luggage vans, painted in the dark blue InterCity logo with a 220 mm white stripe sandwiching a 100 mm red band, minus the parcels traffic. In December 1991 another modular van was refitted with a generator, and a Wairarapa Connection car with 32 seats to a newer design arranged alcove-style and a servery to facilitate the introduction of a third trainset for maintenance requirements, the third set thus becoming a spare. Extra Carriages The former Vice-Regal (Governor- General) car turned Southerner full buffet car was refitted in 1993 and returned to the NIMT with 24 seats to a newer design arranged alcove style and a short buffet counter to replace the full-length counter and 20 bar stools. A new \\"no-frills\\" fare was introduced, using the remaining six Northerner carriages, a Southerner carriage and two Auckland excursion carriages between 1995 and 2002. With the cancellation of the Bay Express in 2001, the three panorama carriages from that train were utilised as a fourth set for the NIMT. Re-equipping From December 1991 to December 1994, nine ex second class passenger coaches built between 1937 and 1945 (one the former TranzAlpine rear-view observation car, one a Southerner car, two from Auckland excursion, three from Auckland suburban and two from Wairarapa commuter services) were extensively refurbished similar to the successful \\"big window\\" panorama cars used on the TranzAlpine, Coastal Pacific and pressure-ventilated Bay Express cars and made into three 3-car/1-van sets for \\"new\\" Overlander/Northerner services, each including a coach with a servery bar where hot food, snacks and beverages can be bought during the trip, a rear view observation car and a 49-seat day car. All nine cars were fully air-conditioned. Vans Three modular vans, one from the Telecom train, one from the Sesqui 1990 and one from the Bay Express trains were refitted to newer designs, all incorporating new-style 90 kW generators for increased on-train requirements, as power- luggage vans. An Auckland suburban van, the other of two Bay Express vans and the second of two Northerner vans were similarly refitted to serve this train. Double duty As the Overlander and Northerner shared rolling stock, substantially better carriage utilisation was achieved, compared to having two train sets sitting unused for over 12 hours a day. On Wednesday 16 August 2006, the first air-conditioned 42-seat rear-view Northerner/Overlander car and its air-conditioned 49-seat day car running mate, were taken to Hutt Workshops and stored, their bogies went under the ex-British Rail cars for the Wairarapa Connection.

Although the coping saw is often used for similar work, the fretsaw is capable of much tighter radii and more delicate work. It has a distinctive appearance due to the depth of its frame (typically between 10 and 20 inches), which together with the relatively short five inch blade makes this tool appear somewhat out of proportion compared with most other saws. Compared with the coping saw it has much shallower blades, which are usually extra-fine, up to 32 teeth per inch (tpi). This allows much tighter curves to be cut—with many blades even sharp corners are possible—but the blades are also much more fragile compared with that of a coping saw. Unlike the coping saw, the blade has a fixed orientation in relation to the frame. This means that the fretsaw is less useful when cutting long narrow components, but the increased depth of the frame does allow access much further from the edge of the board. The fretsaw is similar in many respects to the scroll saw, which is essentially a powered fretsaw with a table. Blades between the two tools are usually interchangeable, and indeed scroll saws are often known as \\"fret saws\\" informally. The tool takes its name from its use in fretwork and ultimately from the French freter (lattice)—a reference to the intricate patterns often created using this tool. Use Because of its sheer size, the frame makes up a large proportion of the total weight of the tool and has a relatively large moment, which in the hands of an inexperienced user can create a tendency for the direction of cut to drift away from that desired. To counter this the fretsaw is usually used with the handle (and blade) aligned on a vertical axis which reduces the effects of this torque. The effect may also be lessened with a shorter (and lighter) frame, although this also reduces the size of components that may be worked. A cutting or fretwork table, also known as a V-board, made of either wood or metal and which clamps to the edge of the workbench, may be used to support the work piece whilst allowing clearance for the saw blade by means of a V-shaped slot cut into it. The blade is usually clamped into position using a pair of wingnuts. Although wing nuts are usually intended for operation without tools it is often impossible to apply sufficient force purely by hand. Wingnut wrenches greatly increase the torque that may be applied, ensuring that the blade is securely clamped. Types of blade Although traditionally intended for woodwork, metal cutting blades are readily available increasing the versatility of this saw. Spiral blades are also available which have teeth on all sides of the blade, and will cut in any direction without the need to rotate either the saw or the work piece. This can be useful when access is restricted due to the size of the component being worked, and compensate in part for the inability to rotate the blade in the manner possible with a coping saw. However, they also have a wider kerf and as such remove more material than a conventional blade. Also available are abrasive blades with no actual teeth, but consist of a wire coated with diamond, carbide, or other abrasive material. These alternative blades make the fretsaw suitable for many tasks traditionally performed by the piercing saw, although piercing saw blades are typically finer still than the finest fretsaw blade.

Flying with a severe cold can also cause perforation due to changes in air pressure and blocked eustachian tubes resulting from the cold. This is especially true on landing. Presentation Perforation of the eardrum leads to conductive hearing loss, which is usually temporary. Other symptoms may include tinnitus, earache, vertigo or a discharge of mucus. Nausea and/or vomiting secondary to vertigo may occur. To diagnose a perforated eardrum, a doctor will examine inside the ear with an instrument called an otoscope. This gives a view of the ear canal and eardrum, allowing confirmation of any rupture/perforation. Treatment The perforation may heal in a few weeks, or may take up to a few months. Some perforations require intervention. This may take the form of a paper patch to promote healing (a simple procedure by an ear, nose and throat specialist), or surgery (tympanoplasty). However, in some cases, the perforation can last several years and will be unable to heal naturally. Hearing is usually recovered fully, but chronic infection over a long period may lead to permanent hearing loss. Those with more severe ruptures may need to wear an ear plug to prevent water contact with the ear drum.

Olgiati Bridge, often incorrectly called the \\"Ol' Johnny\\" or \\"Ol' Jolly\\", is a steel girder bridge across the Tennessee River in Chattanooga, Tennessee completed in 1959. It is named for former mayor and long time political boss of Chattanooga, P.R. Olgiati. Chattanooga was a growing city during the 1950s. To expand the city and to allow more ways to cross the Tennessee River, the P. R. Olgiati Bridge was one of multiple bridges built. The route carries US 27 across the Tennessee river. Description The P. R. Olgiati Bridge is located in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The bridge is one of several major bridges that crosses the Tennessee River in Chattanooga. These bridges include the Walnut Street Bridge, Market Street Bridge, Veterans Memorial Bridge, and Wilkes T. Thrasher Bridge. The P. R. Olgiati Bridge carries a controlled-access portion of US 27, which is a U.S. highway that travels south to north. The bridge crosses the Tennessee River just north of downtown, and links the freeway across the ridge en route to Signal Mountain and Red Bank. Surrounding the bridge is the Tennessee Riverwalk on the south side and just before getting to the bridge, US 27 crosses Riverfront Parkway. History A few years before the idea for the Olgiati Bridge became a discussion, the Wilkes T. Thrasher Bridge had been built in 1955 to provide a way of traveling across the Tennessee River. The Wilkes T. Thrasher bridge and others were built to help the growth of Chattanooga and to expand the use of the river, as well as to provide more ways of travel. Born a native Tennesseean in 1901, Peter Rudolph Olgiati, mainly known as P.R. Olgiati, was appointed to the City Commission and filled the seat of an unexpired term, and later became mayor of Chattanooga for 12 years. He supported the expansion of Chattanooga and building bridges was part of his plan. The bridge expansions were made to contribute to the growth of Chattanooga and to expand the use of the river, as well as to provide more ways of travel for anyone passing through the area. Construction From 1946 to 1951, P.R. Olgiati was appointed to the City Commission and was elected as mayor of Chattanooga and held his position as mayor for 12 years. Olgiati became a man with great authority, power, and responsibility. He ran many of the cities departments and could use his power as an advantage to improve the city. He began his term as mayor by working to draw the state and federal officials attention. After continuous efforts to gain the approval of federal and state officials, Olgiati was granted $100 million to build up the city. Because of his driven ideals, Chattanooga became the very first of any Tennessee major city to have a fully completed interstate system. The new bridge was mainly built because of the excessively used and overcrowded Market and Walnut Street bridges. The bridge was a steel girder bridge, known to be built because they are a high weight supported system. The girder refers to the I-beams that are made up of steel plates that are placed together in order to hold the bridge up. Steel bridges are known to be more costly, but, when built, are much more effective and safe. Olgiati was given the resources to build a well built and supported bridge, which would greatly contribute to travel in Chattanooga. The site was approved in 1954, and construction began the next year. To begin the building process, about one thousand buildings had to be torn down and around 1,400 families had to move. The bridge opened to traffic on November 20, 1959. Initially, the bridge was named Cedar Street Bridge, but soon after was renamed P. R. Olgiati Bridge in regards to Mr. Olgiati's efforts to expand Chattanooga. Recent developments Beginning in February 1999, the Olgiati bridge was widened from four to six lanes. This was accomplished by attaching extending steel beams to the top of the posts over the river. Also in this project, a ramp was added from the bridge on the north side to Manufacturer's Road, replacing a hazardous cloverleaf loop ramp which diverged past the bridge. The project, after many delays, was completed in February 2003. In 2011, TDOT announced a plan add two more lanes to the bridge. The groundwork for extra lanes was already done in the first widening project. The project has experienced many delays, but TDOT began widening the bridge in a reconstruction of the portion of US 27 in downtown Chattanooga (Interstate 124) which began in late 2015, and is expected to be completed by 2020.

Designed by Kenneth MacKenzie Murchison and built in 1916, the station is at 47 Walnut Street, north of downtown Johnstown across the Little Conemaugh River. Today, the station is served by Amtrak's Pennsylvanian, which operates once daily in each direction. The station can be seen in the 1977 film Slap Shot. Services Until 2005, Johnstown was served by a second daily train, the Three Rivers (a replacement service for the Broadway Limited), an extended version of the Pennsylvanian that terminated in Chicago. Upon its cancellation, the sole Pennsylvanian marked the first time in Johnstown's railway history that the town was served by just a single daily passenger train. The Pennsylvanian connects Johnstown to Altoona, Harrisburg, Philadelphia, and New York to the east and Greensburg and Pittsburgh to the west. Staffed ticket service is available for both daily departures. CamTran, the local public transit provider in the greater Johnstown/Cambria County area, has two routes that stop at the train station: *Route 16 - Prospect *Route 18 - Downtown Shuttle The primary CamTran transit center is about one- half mile to the southeast of the Amtrak station.

Andrew Lang included it in The Crimson Fairy Book.Andrew Lang, The Crimson Fairy Book (1903), \\"The Hairy Man\\" Synopsis Two ricks of a King's rapeseed fields are found burned every night. Finally, a shepherd with dogs keeps watch, and catches the \\"Hairy Man\\" who is responsible. The King puts him in a cage. The Hairy Man pleads with the King's son so earnestly that the young prince frees him. For this, the King orders that his son be taken to the forest, and killed, and that his lungs and liver be brought back as proof. The man who takes him can not do it and kills an old sick dog instead. The boy wanders the forest until he comes upon a cottage, where an old man (who was once the same Hairy Man) lives. There he stays for seven years working hard like a peasant, but never complaining until he is old enough to travel on. Before he leaves, the Hairy Man gives the boy a golden apple (which magically contains a golden staff and a golden-maned horse), a silver apple (which contains a silver staff and an army of hussar cavalry), and a copper apple (which contains a copper staff and an army of foot soldiers). The boy uses the first apple, and embarks on his journey, finally pledging his service to a distant King. One day, the King (who only has a small army) is threatened by another very powerful King. The boy uses his second magic apple to make reinforcements for his King. The youngest princess gives him a ring and he carries it and half of a handkerchief his sister gave him into battle. The prince's men destroys the enemy so thoroughly that only two live and are deliberately permitted to escape as messengers to the powerful King that sent them. The prince falls in love with the youngest princess and he gives her the copper apple. The princess has already discovered who he really is after having his room searched which turned up the half handkerchief. When the King learns that he is a prince as well as a brave and honorable hero, the King is more than happy to allow him to marry his youngest daughter.

It is located in the east of the oblast and borders with Kesovogorsky District in the north, Uglichsky District of Yaroslavl Oblast in the east, Kalyazinsky District in the southeast, Kimrsky District in the south, Rameshkovsky District in the west, and with Bezhetsky District in the northwest. The area of the district is . Its administrative center is the town of Kashin. Population: 27,410 (2010 Census); The population of Kashin accounts for 59.0% of the district's total population. Geography The Kashinka River in the village of Bezguzovo. The whole area of the district belongs to the drainage basin of the Volga River. The Volga, built as the Uglich Reservoir, makes the southeastern border of the district. The largest tributaries of the Volga within the district are the Medveditsa River, which crosses the southern part of the district and also makes the stretch of the border with Kimrsky District, and the Kashinka River. History Saint Anna of Kashin, the icon of the late 19th century It is unclear when Kashin was founded, with plausible dates in the 12th and the 13th centuries, and it is reliably mentioned in 1287, when it belonged to Principality of Tver. Since 1319, Kashin was the center of Principality of Kashin, which was first dependent on the Principality of Tver. In fact, Vasily, the first Prince of Kashin, was the son of Mikhail of Tver, and his mother and the wife of Michael, Anna of Kashin, lived in Kashin for the last years of her life. She was later canonized and is considered to be a saint protector of the town. Later, Kashin Principality was slowly drifting towards the Grand Duchy of Moscow. In 1375, it was accepted as an independent principality subordinate to Moscow, then between 1382 and 1399 it was a part of Principality of Tver, and in 1485 it was formally annexed by Moscow and abolished. In 1609 and 1612, during the Time of Troubles, Kashin was badly damaged by the Polish troops. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate), but in 1727 it was transferred to Moscow Governorate. In 1775, Tver Viceroyalty was formed from the lands which previously belonged to Moscow and Novgorod Governorates, and Kashinsky Uyezd was established. In 1796, Tver Viceroyalty was transformed into Tver Governorate. On October 3, 1927 Kashinsky Uyezd was abolished and split between Bezhetsky and Kimrsky Uyezds. On July 12, 1929 the governorates and uyezds were abolished. Kashinsky District, with the administrative center in Kashin, was established within Bezhetsk Okrug of Moscow Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On January 29, 1935 Kalinin Oblast was established, and Kashinsky District was transferred to Kalinin Oblast. On February 13, 1963, during the abortive Khrushchyov administrative reform, Kesovogorsky District was merged into Kashinsky District, but on November 3, 1965 it was re-established. In 1990, Kalinin Oblast was renamed Tver Oblast. Economy The district specializes in agriculture. Other developed industries include logging, liquor and vodka production, mineral water bottling, and production of electrical equipment. The main natural resources in the district are mineral water and peat. Transportation Buses connect the district with Tver and Moscow, as well as provide local transportation. There also roads from Kashin to Kalyazin and Kesova Gora. A railway connects Kashin with Sonkovo and Moscow; there is infrequent passenger traffic. Culture and recreation Saltykovo. The district contains fifty-two cultural heritage monuments of federal significance (thirty-six of them located in Kashin) and additionally eighty- seven objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance (fifty-six of them in Kashin). The federal monuments are the historical buildings in the center of Kashin, including the ensemble of the Presentation Monastery, a number of churches built in the 18th and the 19th centuries, the Shepeli Estate in the selo of Shepeli, as well as a number of archeological sites. There is a local museum in Kashin, open in 1918. Mikhail Kalinin, a Soviet politician, was born in the selo of Verkhnyaya Troitsa. A memorial museum is open in the house which used to belong to his parents.

They are popularly known as \\"No-Hellers\\" due to their belief that there is no Hell per se, but that Hell is actually experienced in this life. History Although they did not split as a denomination away from other Primitive Baptists until 1924, the Primitive Baptist Universalists (PBUs) have been theologically distinct as Universalists since at least 1907, when the minutes of the Washington District Primitive Baptist Association record a reproval: > Resolved, that whereas, we have been troubled with the doctrine of > universalism that we advise the churches that if they have any elders > preaching such heresies, or members arguing it, that they admonish them to > quit preaching it or talking it, and if they fail to hear them to withdraw > fellowship from such, and especially we admonish Hale Creek church to > admonish Elder M. L. Compton to refrain from such doctrine. Recently, there have been several independent congregations develop due to the revival of interest in the unique theological perspective of the Primitive Baptist Universalists. Many of these churches are located in Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, Alabama, and Texas. Holston Primitive Baptist Universalist Church in Rogersville, TN is among the congregations seeking to unite other churches interested in fellowship without formal associations. This fellowship of congregations allow for variations in interpretations, worship practices, and practical matters which impact their local identity. Calvinistic Universalism, simple services, and local outreach is the prevailing theological and practical glue that binds each church to the fellowship. Theology Baptist minister and historian Bill Leonard has characterized PBU beliefs as the result of \\"press[ing] ... Calvinism to the ... conclusion that Christ's redemption is so powerful that all will be redeemed.\\" According to Leonard, PBUs believe \\"It's hell enough down here.\\" Specific tenets of PBU theology include: Universal reconciliation: Christ's atonement was for all humanity, and at Resurrection all humanity will be reunited with Christ for an eternity in Heaven. * Hell is a factor of the temporal world, where temporal sins will be punished by an increased separation from God. * Satan is an entity solely of the temporal world, existing only as \\"natural man\\" warring against \\"spiritual man.\\" * Sin, punishment, and death are factors only of the temporal world, thus ceasing to exist after Resurrection, and sin is punished in the temporal world by a separation from God. * The joy of righteousness is its own reward, so retribution and reward are needed only for the here and now. Numbers and structure Primitive Baptists do not participate in censuses of religious denominations, so there are no solid data on the number of PBUs or other Primitive Baptist groups. Bill Leonard estimated in 2011 that there were 1,000 or fewer PBU adherents in total, concentrated in 20 counties in Appalachia. There are four associations of PBU congregations consisting of a total of thirty-three congregations located in area of northeastern Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky, with three PBU fellowships in Ohio, one in Pennsylvania, and Mt.

Since Morin led a transient lifestyle and constantly moved around the country, the exact number of his victims is uncertain, but he's suspected of a total 48 violent crimes across the USA. In the early 1980s, he was pursued by the federal authorities. The court found Morin sane and sentenced him to death by lethal injection. In 1985, he was executed at the Huntsville Unit. Early life Little is known about Morin's childhood. He was born on February 19, 1951, in Providence, Rhode Island, into a poor family. He dropped out of school early, and in his teenage years, Stephen began to use narcotics and delved into the criminal lifestyle. In the mid-1960s, Stephen was arrested in Florida for car theft. He was convicted and spent some time in an institution for juvenile delinquents. Freed in 1968, Morin left Florida and wandered around the country. For the majority of the 1970s, he resided in Northern California, specifically in the San Francisco Bay Area, constantly changing his places of residence and using various pseudonyms while committing crimes. For some time, he lived in San Francisco, where he worked as a car mechanic and builder. Murders Since the 1970s, Stephen became addicted to drugs and led a transient lifestyle. In 1976, in San Francisco, Morin attacked a 14-year-old girl, abducting and then raping her. After this crime, he was put on a federal wanted list. During this period, he committed a series of murders against young women and girls in different states. In January 1980, he abducted 19-year-old Susan Bilot in Las Vegas, Nevada. Four months later, her body was found in Utah. In June 1980, he abducted 20-year-old Cheryl Ann Daniel from Las Vegas, whose corpse was also found in Utah six months later. Like Bilot, she had been shot dead. Near Daniel's body, a credit card belonging to Morin was found, which allowed the investigators to connect these killings back to him. At the end of 1981, he found himself in Colorado, where in the fall of 1981, he killed 23-year-old Sheila Whalen in Golden. After Whalen's murder, Morin moved to Texas, attacking 21-year-old Janna Bruce in Corpus Christi, whose strangled body was found on December 2nd. On December 11, 1981, Morin attempted to abduct 21-year-old Carrie Ann Scott while attempting to steal her car. Initially, he said that he'd had no intentions to kill her, but claimed to have been overcome with something, and subsequently shot her in the parking lot of Maggie's Restaurant in San Antonio. After that, he abducted Margy Mayfield and held her hostage for 10+ hours in a car. Arrest Following Scott's murder, the motel in San Antonio, where Morin had been staying for the past few days, was surrounded by the SAPD's SWAT team and searched, during which 32-year-old Sarah Clark, his accomplice, was arrested, and 23-year-old Pamela Jackson, another victim abducted on November 30th, was rescued. During the search of the motel room, several false IDs, credit cards and social security cards were located, which would lead to suspicions that Morin committed other murders in a multitude of states. On the afternoon of December 12th, Stephen Morin was arrested at a bus station in Austin. At the time of his arrest, he surrendered without resistance. Upon arrival in Austin, Morin had released Mayfield. Despite his peaceful surrender, Morin refused to cooperate with investigators and claimed to be innocent. Trials Morin was charged with the murders of Carrie Ann Scott and Janna Bruce, since there was a lot of evidence supporting his guilt in those cases. After withdrawing his appeals and pleading guilty, he was convicted and sentenced to death in February 1984. Later on, he was additionally convicted of killing Daniel, before being extradited to Colorado on charges of killing Sheila Whalen, for whose killing he was also sentenced to death at the end of 1984. Morin was also supposed to be later extradited to Utah to stand trial for other killings he supposedly committed there, but for reasons unknown, this never occurred. In total, Stephen Morin was investigated for 48 violent murders committed in the states of Utah, Colorado, Nevada, Washington, Idaho, Indiana, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Texas, New York and California. In Nevada alone, Morin was tested for involvement in 8 murders. Imprisonment After his conviction, Morin converted to Christianity. His execution date was scheduled for March 1985. Shortly before this, the convicted stated that he did not want to appeal for a new trial or postpone the execution, which conflicted with his lawyer David Goldstein, whom filed a petition for a forensic examination on his client, since he showed signs of mental retardation. The application, however, was rejected. Execution Morin was executed by lethal injection on the afternoon of March 13, 1985, at the Huntsville Unit in Texas, in the presence of his victims' relatives and his girlfriend. On the day of his execution, for his last meal, Stephen ordered steak, baked potatoes, butter, green pea salad, banana pudding and coffee. His final words were the following: Before his execution, Morin was described as being in a happy mood. Due to his history of drug abuse, the execution technicians were forced to probe both of Morin's arms and legs with needles for nearly 45 minutes before they found a suitable vein, a first-time occurrence at that time. He was pronounced dead at 12:55 AM, becoming the sixth man to be executed by lethal injection in Texas since the method was introduced in 1982.

At least 3000 men of the Scottish Royal Army led by Tam Dalyell of the Binns opposed about 900 armed Covenanter insurgents. The Dalry Covenanter Sculpture marks the start of the uprising The Pentland Rising was in the context of the long-running government campaign to impose episcopalianism upon Scotland. The spontaneous uprising began in St. John’s Town of Dalry, where troops were beating an elderly man who had defaulted on a fine for not attending the government's mandatory episcopal services. The troops were interrupted by four Covenanters and then supported by the local populace, who disarmed the soldiers. Robert McClellan of Barscobe led the Rising; he gathered some men in Dalry, led them to Balmaclellan, where after a skirmish with other troops, he raised more men. McClellan led them to Dumfries, and there they captured the local commander, General James Turner, at 5.30 in the morning, still in his nightshirt, in his lodgings on the Whitesands. McClellan, aided by Neilson of Corsock, took the gathering force up to Ayrshire, thence to Lanarkshire, and then to Colinton near Edinburgh, on their way to present their petition to the Parliament. Many deserted the group following bad weather, a poor choice of routes and the news received at Colinton that they could not expect a sympathetic reception in Edinburgh. From a peak of perhaps 3000 men the force had diminished by half at Colinton, and then further dispersed as the group headed home towards Galloway. The Covenanters were mostly \\"unbred, illiterate men\\" with some landowners with a third group being field preachers; they included very few experienced professional soldiers. They were commanded by Colonel James Wallace of Auchens, seconded by Major Joseph Learmont. The insurgent forces decided to hold a parade and review by Colonel Wallace at Rullion Green in the Pentland Hills. General Tam Dalyell of the Binns was with a force in Currie, and cut through the Pentland Hills to confront them. The survivors were treated with cruelty; 15, including Neilson of Corsock, were hanged, drawn and quartered, and several, including two boys of 18, were tortured first with the boot. The battlefield was added to the Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland in 2011. Historic context map of Pentland Rising Carnethy Hill and Rullion Green map of Battle of Rullion Green A Court of High Commission was again established under the auspices of Sharp, consisting of nine prelates and thirty-five other members. But a bishop with four others constituted a quorum, and the times and places of meeting were left entirely to the discretion of the judge. The method of proceeding was altogether arbitrary, disdaining all the usual formalities and maxims of law. The persons brought before it were generally seized without being informed for what cause; they were often prosecuted without any written indictment, and when a specific accusation was brought against them, the judges did not think it necessary to adhere to it, but admitted new matter at the time of the trial. Witnesses were sometimes suborned by the judges; and in many cases no witnesses were called at all. Ensnaring and captious questions were put, and if these were answered satisfactorily, or if the allegations of their adversaries were disproved, the accused might still be condemned for refusing to take the oath of allegiance, or for hesitating to acknowledge the spiritual supremacy of the King. In many cases the questions were such as could not be answered to the satisfaction of the judges by any honest man, \\"What think you of the government?\\" was one of these puzzling interrogations. No person was allowed to offer any defence till he took the oath of supremacy, or some other engagement which his conscience disapproved. The consequence of refusal was either imprisonment or banishment, or a heavy pecuniary fine. Conviction of the offence libelled was invariably followed with the utmost severity of punishment, even when the accused was induced to confess by the promise of being dismissed with impunity. upper part of the Covenanters' Memorial Some of the parishioners of Ancrum, after the banishment of their minister, because he declined taking the oath of supremacy, except with an explanation, remonstrated against the admission of a curate of infamous character, who at the same time enjoyed two other livings. They were brought before the High Commission, and confessed that they had expressed their dissatisfaction at the intrusion of a man whom they thought unworthy of the charge. The Commission immediately sentenced them, as contemners of the ordinances, to be scourged through the town, stigmatised (that is, branded with a red-hot iron), and thereafter imprisoned, and with the first ship conveyed to Barbadoes. For the same opposition to the entry of the curate of Ancrum, two brothers were soon afterwards transported to Barbadoes, and their sister barbarously scourged through the town of Jedburgh. This is but a slight instance of their procedure at an early period, during which this Court of High Commission and the Privy Council divided the exercise of illegal oppression. At length the lay commissioners, shocked at the excessive cruelty of the bishops, refused to take any part in the proceedings; the people, preferring the risk of being outlawed, refused to obey the summons of the judges; and the Commission, in the course of two years, was allowed to expire. From one point of view these 'interesting times' might be regarded as the \\"teething troubles\\" of Charles II's new regime. The abolition of this court, however, was not the dawn of better times. The western part of Scotland was exposed to all the fury of military violence. Sir James Turner, an Englishman, was sent with a considerable body of troops into Dumfriesshire, Galloway, and Ayrshire. Wherever the people deserted their parish churches, they were fined, imprisoned, plundered, beaten, wounded, and hunted through the mountains like wild beasts. The clergy stimulated the soldiers to all these acts of oppression and inhumanity; and the soldiers were allowed to act both as judges and executioners. Though innumerable families were dispersed and ruined, though the prisons were crowded with the victims of clerical jealousy, and though comfort and peace was banished from the whole country, Turner declared afterwards that he was never able to satisfy the bishops that his severities were sufficient. The monument outside Dreghorn Barracks at Colinton near Edinburgh, which commemorates Rullion Green After a time the peasantry, driven to distraction, began to resist, and obtained possession of the person of the commander under whose violence the country had groaned for two or three years; but on discovering that with all his harshness, he had been far from acting up to the full measure of his instructions, they spared his life. They now marched towards Edinburgh, without disorder, under the command of two military officers, and, increasing in numbers as they advanced, they renewed the Covenant, and published a declaration that they did not rise in arms against the King, but that they only desired deliverance from the tyranny of the bishops, and the restoration of their own ministers, and the form of Church government established by the Covenant. Kirkton records that even at the beginning the insurgents drank the king's health and M'Crie, over about 8 pages, argues repeatedly that although they rose in arms, they were not rebels. He says those involved in the rising regarded it as \\"sinless self- defence\\" and they were wanting justice rather than seeking to overthrow the king or his government. Their force at one time amounted to two thousand; but when they arrived at Colinton, two miles from Edinburgh, more than one-half of the number had withdrawn, probably in obedience to the proclamation which required them to lay down their arms within twenty-four hours, though it contained no assurance of indemnity. General Dalziel, who commanded the royal forces at Glasgow, advanced to meet them, and agreed upon a cessation of arms till the following day, that they might have an opportunity of presenting their petition to the Council. In the meantime, an attempt was made to surprise them, while they were worn out with fatigue, watching, and hunger. They began to retreat; but when they found the enemy pressing close upon them, they drew up their diminished line of eight hundred men on the south of Pentland Hills, and in successive attacks repulsed their opponents. The sun had set in a cold frosty evening at the end of November, when the last encounter took place. The insurgents were completely broken and routed, forty were killed, and one hundred and thirty taken prisoners. Almost all the rest escaped unhurt; but the prisoners were condemned without mercy at the instigation of the unmanly prelates. Above twenty were executed in Edinburgh, thirty-five were hanged at their own doors in the country, and many of them were tortured before their death, to compel them to discover the authors of the rebellion; the other prisoners were banished. The numerous and frequent executions at length shocked and alarmed the Court, and an order came down to the Council to proceed no further. This order was withheld by Sharp and the Archbishop of Glasgow till their bloodthirsty vengeance was satiated with the torments and death of a youth named Mackail, who had left the insurgents before they reached Colinton, and whose real offence was an expression in a sermon, which was supposed to allude to the oppressions of the government. He had said that in former times the Church had suffered from a Pharaoh on the throne, a Haman in the State, and a Judas in the Church; and as Sharp began very early to be known by the name of Judas, the application was understood to be made to him. The west was now again surrendered to military outrage. The country was burdened with heavy contributions to support the cavalry, and at the same time the soldiers were permitted to take free quarter, and to demand whatever they chose. Many persons were put to the sword, — others were crowded together in dungeons, so that there was not room for them even to stand, — some were shot or hanged without even the form of a trial, — some were tortured to death because they would not inform where their nearest relations were concealed, — and the brutal agents of these horrid atrocities were allowed by their commanders to commit every revolting crime which licentiousness, or avarice, or malice could dictate. The judges partook of the iniquitous rigour which disgraced the army. In opposition to the laws of the land, they tried and condemned many gentlemen of property in their absence, and conferred their estates on the military leaders or the officers of state; and knowing that these proceedings were illegal, they applied to Parliament for their confirmation. Every prisoner against whom there was no proof, was required to abjure the Covenant, and if he refused, he was transported to the English plantations, and condemned to slavery. There was no statute authorising such a penalty; but the King's instructions were at that time equivalent to law.

It is the sole school in the Community High School District 94. History From 1904-1926, the old junior high school (since torn down and now the present location of the West Chicago Fire Department) and various buildings in the city of West Chicago were used as high school classrooms. On December 28, 1924, the citizens voted to construct a high school at the present site. The opening date of the new high school was September 23, 1926. The 21st annual commencement (the first at the new high school) was held on June 11, 1927. The graduating class consisted of 27 students (20 girls and 7 boys). In 1954, Community High School experienced its first addition to the building. That addition is the area that now includes the cafeteria, small gym, and some classroom facilities. In 1964 another major addition was approved by the Board of Education. This area includes the Bishop Gymnasium and all of the new classroom facilities in the northern part of the building. In 1978 additions were added to the north and south ends of the building providing a swimming pool, fieldhouse, greenhouses, library, commons, and administrative offices. In the summer of 1998 ground was broken for the addition of twenty-eight classrooms, a fitness center and dance studio, and the construction of a new sports stadium. The new classrooms, fitness center and dance studio are located on the west side of the building. In addition to new construction, the building referendum passed in 1997 included monies for the installation of new heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning systems for the remaining parts of the building. The referendum allocated 1.8 million dollars for technology. Technology has been integrated into all classrooms in the school. The high school now has 12 fully equipped computer labs, an Online College and Career Center,a Yearbook Production Lab, and laptop computers. Academics In 2008, West Chicago had an average composite ACT score of 20.4 and graduated 96.1% of its senior class. West Chicago has not made Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) on the Prairie State Achievements Examination, which with the ACT comprise the assessment tools used in Illinois to fulfill the federal No Child Left Behind Act. Four of the school's five student subgroups did not meet minimum expectations in reading, while three did not meet minimum expectations in mathematics.Class of 2008 school report card; Information begins on p. 8 of this report; accessed 23 June 2009 Athletics As of the 2013-14 school year, West Chicago will compete in the Upstate Eight Conference (UEC or U8C) and is a member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA), which governs most interscholastic sports and competitive activities in Illinois.Upstate Eight invites three DVC schools accessed 1 March 2013 Press Release: Upstate Eight Conference Affiliation accessed 1 March 2013West Chicago formerly competed in the DuPage Valley Conference (DVC), where it was one of the smallest schools.

Advertising that \\"every woman is different,\\" by the 1950s, the shampoo was available in three expressions, color-coded for easy identity:Full page magazine advertisement for Breck Shampoos, 1960. * D (red label) \\"For Dry Hair\\" * O (yellow label) \\"For Oily Hair\\" * N (blue label) \\"For Normal Hair\\" In 1963, Breck was sold to Shulton Division of American Cyanamid, a chemical company based in New Jersey. Breck was sold to The Dial Corporation in 1990. In 2001, Dial licensed Breck to The Himmel Group and in 2006 it was licensed to Dollar Tree. Dial Corporation (now Henkel North American Consumer Goods) continues to market Breck shampoo in the institutional market. Breck Girls In 1936, son Edward J. Breck (1907–1993) assumed management of Breck Shampoo and hired commercial artist Charles Gates Sheldon (1889 – 1961) to draw women for their advertisements. Sheldon's early portraits for Breck were done in pastels, with a soft focus and halos of light and color surrounding them. He created romantic images of feminine beauty and purity. He preferred to draw \\"real women\\" as opposed to professional models. In 1957 Ralph William Williams succeeded Sheldon as the Breck artist. Unlike Sheldon, he often used professional women. Breck advertisements ran regularly in magazines such as Ladies Home Journal, Woman's Home Companion, Seventeen, Vogue, Glamour, and Harper's Bazaar. They were most often on the back cover of the magazine. During these years, Breck Girls were identified through the company's sponsorship of America's Junior Miss contests. After Williams' death in 1976, the advertising tradition stopped. It was relaunched in 1987 with portrait artist Robert Anderson. Celia Gouge from Atlanta was chosen as the 1987 Breck Girl. Joanne DeLavan O'Donnell, also from Atlanta, was chosen as the 1988 Breck Girl. In 1988, the then owner of the brand changed the name of the campaign spokesperson to The Breck Woman.

Manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard and designed by Werner Stengel at a cost of $13 million, Talon opened to the public in 2001 and was marketed as the tallest and longest inverted coaster in the Northeast. It stands tall, reaches a maximum speed of , and features four inversions. History On April 28, 2000, Dorney Park announced that a four inversion inverted roller coaster would be built for the 2001 season. No further details were given until August 30, 2000 when Dorney Park announced the full details of the new $13 million roller coaster and its name, Talon. The ride would be the Northeast's longest inverted roller coaster and would be built on a portion of land set aside for a major attraction by Cedar Fair when they purchased the park in 1992. Construction began on September 5, 2000 and continued through the winter. The first parts of Talon to be put into place were the brake run and transfer track in October 2000. The roller coaster was topped off (the highest piece of the lift hill) on November 21, 2000 and the track was completed in early 2001. After testing was complete, Talon opened on May 5, 2001. Experience Talon's first drop Talon's Immelmann loop Having dispatched from the station, the train immediately begins to climb the lift hill. Once at the top, the train goes through a pre-drop before making a sharp downward right turn. The train then enters a tall vertical loop. After exiting the loop, the train goes through a zero-gravity roll before dropping back to the ground and entering an immelmann loop. The train then makes a full 360-degree upward right turn followed by a left turn leading into another drop. After the drop, the train makes highly banked right turn into a flat spin. Next, the train makes a left turn (extremely close to the ground) before heading to an airtime, and back up which leads into the brake run. After exiting the brake run, the train makes a right turn into a second, shorter, set of brakes before entering the station. One cycle of the ride lasts about 2 minutes. Characteristics Trains Talon operates with two steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has eight cars that can seat four riders in a single row for a total of 32 riders per train. The train structure is coloured blue and turquoise, the seats are black, and the over-the-shoulder restraints are yellow. Track The steel track of Talon is approximately long, the height of the lift is approximately high, and the entire track weighs just under . It was manufactured by Clermont Steel Fabricators located in Batavia, Ohio. Unlike other B&M; coasters, the track is filled with sand to reduce the noise produced by the trains. The tracks are painted orange and yellow while the supports are blue. Slogan & theme The entrance sign has a mini- slogan as \\"The Grip Of Fear. The word \\"Talon\\" is named after a claw, which is specifically found on birds of prey and mythical creatures. The ride is themed as a bird of prey.

It has a characteristic sweet odor that resembles gasoline and kerosene. It is toxic and is a powerful oxidizing and fluorinating agent. It is the acid fluoride of perchloric acid. In spite of its small enthalpy of formation (ΔHf° = −5.2 kcal/mol), it is kinetically stable, decomposing only at 400 °C. It is quite reactive towards reducing agents and anions, however, with the chlorine atom acting as an electrophile. It reacts explosively with reducing agents such as metal amides, metals, hydrides, etc. Its hydrolysis in water occurs very slowly, unlike that of chloryl fluoride. Synthesis and chemistry Perchloryl fluoride is produced primarily by the fluorination of perchlorates. Antimony pentafluoride is a commonly used fluorinating agent: : + 3 HF + 2 -> \\\\+ + 2 reacts with alcohols to produce alkyl perchlorates, which are extremely shock-sensitive explosives. In the presence of a Lewis acid, it can be used for introducing the group into aromatic rings via electrophilic aromatic substitution. Applications Perchloryl fluoride is used in organic chemistry as a mild fluorinating agent. It was the first industrially relevant electrophilic fluorinating agent, used since the 1960s for producing fluorinated steroids. In the presence of aluminum trichloride, it has also been used as a electrophilic perchlorylation reagent for aromatic compounds. Perchloryl fluoride was investigated as a high performance liquid rocket fuel oxidizer. In comparison with chlorine pentafluoride and bromine pentafluoride, it has significantly lower specific impulse, but does not tend to corrode tanks. It does not require cryogenic storage. Rocket fuel chemist John Drury Clark reported in his book Ignition! https://library.sciencemadness.org/library/books/ignition.pdf that perchloryl fluoride is completely miscible with all-halogen oxidizers such as chlorine trifluoride and chlorine pentafluoride, and such a mixture provides the needed oxygen to properly burn carbon-containing fuels. It can also be used in flame photometry as an excitation source. Safety Perchloryl fluoride is toxic, with a TLV of 3 ppm. It is a strong lung- and eye-irritant capable of producing burns on exposed skin. Its IDLH level is 100 ppm. Symptoms of exposure include dizziness, headaches, syncope, and cyanosis. Exposure to toxic levels causes severe respiratory tract inflammation and pulmonary edema.

() is a Russian fairy tale. Andrew Lang included it in The Crimson Fairy Book. Synopsis Everyone in a king's country had to say \\"To your good health!\\" whenever he sneezed, but a shepherd with the staring eyes would not say it. The king summoned him and demanded it, but the shepherd would only say, \\"To my good health.\\" The chamberlain told him he would be killed if he did not, and the shepherd said that he would say it only if he married the princess. The princess thought him handsome enough to marry, but the king was enraged. He had the shepherd thrown in the white bear's pit, but the shepherd's eyes scared it off. Then he had him thrown into a pit of wild boars, but the shepherd played a pipe and made them dance, so they did not harm him. Then he was to have him thrown into a well of scythes, but the shepherd told the guard to give him a minute to look down the well, he might decide to say it after all, and in that minute, he whipped up a dummy that the soldier threw down instead of him. Then the king offered him a silver wood, a golden castle, and a diamond lake to say it, but the shepherd still said he would say it only he had the princess to wife. The king married him to the princess. At the wedding feast, he sneezed, and the shepherd said, first of all, \\"To your good health!\\" which so delighted the king that he did not mind the marriage. In time, the shepherd succeeded the king. He did not order his people to wish him well against their wills, but everyone did wish him well because he was a good king.

Fought on 1 December 1299 between the forces of Frederick II of Sicily and Philip I of Taranto of the Kingdom of Naples, it was a momentous victory for Frederick and a disaster for Philip, who was captured. Prelude Philip had been named, on 12 July 1294, as vicar-general of the Kingdom of Sicily by his father, Charles II of Naples. As such, he took over preparations for a general invasion of the island, which invasion was realised in November 1299. He landed with about fifty galleys and numerous militia and noblemen and besieged Trapani. Frederick lost no time in assembling the able-bodied citizenry and his own troops at Castrogiovanni and marching to relieve Trapani. On the plain of Falconaria, between Marsala and Trapani, the two armies met. Philip assembled his army in traditional feudal fashion: three battles abreast. He himself commanded the right, while the centre was under the command of the marshal, Broglio dei Bonsi, and the left Thomas II Sanseverino, count of Marsico. Frederick too followed typical medieval tactics and aligned his forces in three columns side-by-side. Frederick commanded his own centre, composed entirely of infantry. The left he put under command of Blasco I of Alagona, with a little cavalry and some Almogàvers. The right was composed mainly of cavalry under the direction of Frederick's premier vassals, the victors of Montaperti. Battle The battle started when the Sicilian left marched against Sanseverino. In response, Philip ordered his crossbowmen to bombard the Almogàvers. Philip himself then led his men against Blasco and the Sicilian left, but meeting strong resistance, he moved against the weak Sicilian centre under Frederick himself. This move was fatal. Broglio was impeded from entering at that moment and this gave the opportunity to Blasco to turn his Almogàver mercenaries on Philip, whose cavalry, the flower of Neapolitan chivalry, was completely disordered. Philip fought bravely until he was unhorsed and taken prisoner. Aftermath With their leader captured, the Neapolitan attack melted away and Frederick marched victoriously into Trapani.

The development of the countryside, the changes in customs and manners during this period of time as well as the growth of the Bayard family and their accumulation of property sums up vividly a wide aspect of American life. It is a serious play lightened with humor of character; it has a human, tender, moving quality both appealing and forceful. Performance history It was first performed jointly by the Yale Dramatic Association and the Vassar Philaletheis Society. Currently, Samuel French, Inc., owns the rights to The Long Christmas Dinner. Adaptation In 1963, an operatic adaptation, with music by Paul Hindemith to text by Wilder, entitled The Long Christmas Dinner, was premiered at the Juilliard School of Music. Influence The Long Christmas Dinner inspired a famous scene in Orson Welles's 1941 film Citizen Kane — the breakfast-table montage in which the nine-year deterioration of Kane's marriage is told through a conversation seen in five vignettes. Several breakfast scenes were to be filmed, but during shooting Welles had the idea of simply photographing it as a continuous scene without dissolves, with the camera whipping back and forth. \\"[The idea] was stolen from The Long Christmas Dinner of Thornton Wilder!\\" Welles told filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich. \\"I did the breakfast scene thinking I'd invented it. It wasn't in the script originally. And when I was almost finished with it, I suddenly realized that I'd unconsciously stolen it from Thornton and I called him up and admitted to it.\\" When Bogdanovich asked how Wilder reacted, Welles replied, \\"He was pleased.\\" Welles and Wilder were good friends.Welles, Orson, and Peter Bogdanovich, edited by Jonathan Rosenbaum, This is Orson Welles.

A planetary reduction drive is a small scale version using ball bearings in an epicyclic arrangement instead of toothed gears. Reduction drives are used in engines of all kinds to increase the amount of torque per revolution of a shaft: the gearbox of any car is a ubiquitous example of a reduction drive. Common household uses are washing machines, food blenders and window-winders. Reduction drives are also used to decrease the rotational speed of an input shaft to an appropriate output speed. Reduction drives can be a gear train design or belt driven. Planetary reduction drives are typically attached between the shaft of the variable capacitor and the tuning knob of any radio, to allow fine adjustments of the tuning capacitor with smooth movements of the knob. Planetary drives are used in this situation to avoid \\"backlash\\", which makes tuning easier. If the capacitor drive has backlash, when one attempts to tune in a station, the tuning knob will feel sloppy and it will be hard to perform small adjustments. Gear-drives can be made to have no backlash by using split gears and spring tension but the shaft bearings have to be very precise. Reduction gear in light aircraft Rotax 582 pusher installation on a Quad City Challenger II, showing a toothed-belt reduction drive. Piston- engined light aircraft may have direct-drive to the propeller or may use a reduction drive. The advantages of direct-drive are simplicity, lightness and reliability, but a direct-drive engine may never achieve full output, as the propeller might exceed its maximum permissible rpm. For instance, a direct- drive aero engine (such as the Jabiru 2200) has a nominal maximum output of 64 kW (85 bhp) at 3,300 RPM,http://www.jabiru.net.au/engines/4-cylinder but if the propeller cannot exceed 2,600 rpm, the maximum output would be only about 70 bhp. By contrast, a Rotax 912 has an engine capacity of only 56% of the Jabiru 2200, but its reduction gear (of 1 : 2.273 or 1 : 2.43) allows the full output of 80 bhp to be exploited. The Midwest twin-rotor wankel engine has an eccentric shaft that spins up to 7,800 rpm, so a 2.96:1 reduction gear is used. Aero-engine reduction gears are typically of the gear type, but smaller two-stroke engines such as the Rotax 582 use belt drive with toothed belts, which is a cheap and lightweight option with built-in damping of power surges.  Reduction Drives on Marine Vessels  Most of the world’s ships are powered by diesel engines which can be split into three categories, low speed (<400 rpm), medium speed (400-1200 rpm), and high speed (1200+ rpm). Low speed diesels operate at speeds within the optimum range for propeller usage. Thus it is acceptable to directly transmit power from the engine to the propeller. For medium and high speed diesels, the rotational speed of the crankshaft within the engine must be reduced in order to reach the optimum speed for use by a propeller. Reduction drives operate by making the engine turn a high speed pinion against a gear, turning the high rotational speed from the engine to lower rotational speed for the propeller. The amount of reduction is based on the number of teeth on each gear. For example, a pinion with 25 teeth, turning a gear with 100 teeth, must turn 4 times in order for the larger gear to turn once. This reduces the speed by a factor of 4 while raising the torque 4 fold. This reduction factor changes depending on the needs and operating speeds of the machinery. The reduction gear aboard the Training Ship Golden Bear has a ratio of 3.6714:1. So when the two Enterprise R5 V-16 diesel engines operate at their standard 514 rpm, the propeller turns at 140 rpm. A large variety of reduction gear arrangements are used in the industry. The three arrangements most commonly used are: double reduction utilizing two pinion nested, double reduction utilizing two-pinion articulated, and double reduction utilizing two-pinion locked train. The gears used in a ship's reduction gearbox are usually double helical gears. This design helps lower the amount of required maintenance and increase the lifetime of the gears. Helical gears are used because the load upon it is more distributed then in other types. The double helical gear set can also be called a herringbone gear and consists of two oppositely angled sets of teeth. A single set of helical teeth will produce a thrust parallel to the axle of the gear (known as axial thrust) due to the angular nature of the teeth. By adding a second set opposed to the first set, the axial thrust created by both sets cancels each other out. When installing reduction gears on ships the alignment of the gear is critical. Correct alignment helps ensure a uniform distribution of load upon each pinion and gear. When manufactured, the gears are assembled in such a way as to obtain uniform load distribution and tooth contact. After completion of construction and delivery to shipyard it is required that these gears achieve proper alignment when first operated under load. Some shipbuilders will have the gears transported and installed as a complete assembly. Others will have the gears dismantled, shipped, reassembled in their shops and lowered as a complete assembly into the ship. While finally others will have the gears dismantled, shipped and reassembled in the ship. These three methods are the most common used by shipbuilders to achieve proper alignment and each of them work based upon the assumption that proper alignment was correctly achieved at the manufacturer. Because of the involvement in the process of aligning reduction drives, there are two main sources of responsibility to achieve proper alignment. That of the shipbuilder and that of the gear manufacturer. The shipbuilder must provide a foundation that is sufficiently strong and rigid so that the gear mounting surface does not deflect greatly under operating conditions, a shaft alignment drawing that details the positions of line bearing and the method for aligning the forward piece of line shafting to the reduction gear coupling and the location of stern tube being such that the normal wear down of the stern tube will not induce significant movement of the reduction gear coupling from its proper alignment. The gear manufacturer is then responsible for ensuring basic gear alignment, such that the final assembly measurements are taken carefully and recorded for the reduction drive to be installed correctly, proper tooth contact in the factory, where the manufacturer accurately and precisely assembles the gears and pinions, and denoting all steps performed, making measurements of parts at the different steps and final assembly then forwarding this data to the shipbuilder so that they may assure the degree of accuracy required by the gear designer in the resulting shipboard assembly. Thrust bearings do not commonly appear on reduction drives on ships because axial loading is handled by a thrust bearing separate from the reduction drive assembly. But on smaller reduction drives attached to auxiliary machinery or if the design of the ship demands it, one can find thrust bearings as a part of the assembly. In order to ensure a reduction drive's smooth working and long lifetime, it is vital to have lubricating oil. A reduction drive that is ran with oil free of impurities like water, dirt, grit and flakes of metal, requires little care in comparison to other type of engine room machinery.

A fish tank at the Oklahoma Aquarium The Oklahoma Aquarium is public aquarium built in 2002 and opened on May 28, 2003 in Jenks, a southern suburb of Tulsa. The Oklahoma Aquarium is home to the world's largest exhibit of bull sharks, as well as a loggerhead sea turtle, zebra shark, and humphead wrasse. As of 2020, the aquarium has more than 500 species and 10,000 animals. The original concept of the idea was brought to the forefront by Tulsa and abandon. The City of Jenks' former Mayor Mike Tinker, former City Manager Randy Ewing, P.R. Ramey and several other Tulsa philanthropists pitched their money alongside tax dollars to fund the project. The facility, designed by the architecture firm SPARKS and constructed by Ross Group, features eight exhibits including sites that focus on invertebrates, Oklahoma species, Ozark habitats, a coral reef, and sharks. The aquarium also formerly housed the Karl and Beverly White National Fishing Tackle Museum, a major collection of 30,000 pieces of antique fishing tackle donated by Karl White. Mr. White withdrew his collection in 2010. In July 2003, Discovery Channel's naturalist and filmmaker Nigel Marven (along with crew) documented four bull sharks at home in the architecturally innovative tank. The resulting shots and commentary were featured in the 2003 edition of Discovery Channel's Shark Week series. The Oklahoma Aquarium receives part of the funding of the one-cent county sales tax approved in 2005 by voters under Vision 2025. The state legislature has authorized a specialty Oklahoma Aquarium license plate option with some of the fees going to support the facility.

This main line extends from Hopkins, Minnesota (a Western suburb of the Twin Cities) to Appleton, Minnesota. The line was originally built between Hopkins and Cologne Minnesota in 1876 by Hastings and Dakota Railroad. In 1913, the Milwaukee Road rerouted it, reducing the curves. The line was eventually extended to the Pacific. As of 1991, the TCWR also has trackage rights over the BNSF Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 2012, the TCWR purchased the Sisseton Milbank Railroad and it now operates as a subsidiary of the Twin Cities and Western Railway.\\"Sisseton Milbank Railroad Overview.\\" Twin Cities & Western Railroad Company. Retrieved: 22 March 2015. The company is also affiliated with the Red River Valley and Western Railroad in North Dakota, and the Minnesota Prairie Line, which has a junction with the Twin Cities and Western in Norwood Young America, Minnesota. Current routing Until Hiawatha Avenue (Minnesota State Highway 55) was reconstructed in the 1990s and plans for the Hiawatha Line light rail service entered late stages, the Twin Cities and Western operated on Canadian Pacific's Bass Lake Subdivision through the 29th Street railway trench in Minneapolis, now known as the Midtown Greenway. The tracks continued along the former Milwaukee Road Short Line into Saint Paul, where TC&W; would access rail yards operated by Canadian Pacific, the Minnesota Commercial Railway, and others. As part of the Hiawatha project, the railroad's route to St Paul was moved from the 29th Street Corridor to the Kenilworth Corridor (former M&STL;/C&NW; track) to Cedar Lake Junction onto the BNSF just west of downtown Minneapolis. The re-route occurred August 1998. After the re-route onto to Kenilworth Corridor occurred in 1998, HCRRA constructed the Kenilworth Trail adjacent to the railroad track, using railroad right-of-way acquired from the Chicago North Western Railway by the Hennepin County Regional Railroad Authority. The Kenilworth alignment had first been built as part of the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway and eventually became part of the Chicago and North Western Railway. The Hennepin County Regional Rail Authority acquired the land (1984?) prior to when C&NW; abandoned the line (1993?) . The existing freight operation shares the corridor with the Kenilworth Trail. The temporary alignment was only expected to last five years and was proposed as a way to preserve the route for future transit. It has been more than a decade since this alignment opened. The connection is reaching the end of its lifespan and requires rehabilitation. Planned changes A rerouting of the line was re-examined in 2009 for the planned Southwest Corridor light-rail line. Building the connection to the MN&S; Subdivision was expected to cost about $48 million. A more detailed analysis was expected to be completed by the end of 2010. Because there was no freight rail engineering study done on the planned re-route of the freight rail route, and once the freight rail engineering study was completed in 2013, the impact of a safe re-route of freight rail was determined to negatively impact the local community, therefore the local community rejected freight rail reroute plans to the MN&S; Subdivision in 2014. Rolling stock and other properties TC&W; has 9 Caterpillar Generation II locomotives (4 GP20Cs, 3 GP30Cs, 2 GP15Cs), 2 ex-KCC GP39-2s, 1 CF7 slug unit, 1 Paducah rebuilt GP10, 1 SW1200, and 6 GP38-2s. Trains typically run six days per week between the Twin Cities and Renville with two- or three-day-per-week service west of Renville to Milbank, SD.

Biography Early life Yisrael Mendel Kaplan was born in 1913 in Baranovich, Poland (now Baranavichy, Belarus) to Avraham and Esther Kaplan. Avraham was a lawyer and Esther was involved in community service: Raising funds for the Yeshiva, feeding the poor and so forth. After his bar mitzva, he was enrolled in the yeshiva of Rabbi Elchonon Wasserman. He was considered a very promising student and was assigned Wasserman's son, Naftali, as a study partner. He later studied in the Mir yeshiva as well. Marriage and children While studying in Mir, he married Sarah Baila Gutman (b. Navahrudak, 1910 – d. New York City, March 12, 2008 ), the daughter of Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch Gutman, the administrator of the yeshiva in Baranovich. When Rabbi Gutman was looking for a match, he asked Rabbi Elchonon Wasserman about a number of prospects. Reb Elchonon recommended Kaplan. When Rabbi Gutman pressed him \\"Isn't your own son, Naftoli, a little better?\\" Reb Elchonon answered \\"My Naftoli is a good boy, but he doesn't measure up to Mendel.\\" (Greenwald 1995:31) They had six children: *Tzirel, Wife of Rabbi Haim Benoliel *Rachel, Wife of Rabbi David Lopian *Rabbi Yerucham Kaplan *Chaim Ozer Kaplan (born c.1942, died in Shanghai) *Shimon Kaplan *Esther, Wife of Rabbi Shaul Hutner Escape from the Nazis In late 1939, the German's Invasion of Poland overtook Poland and the Jews of Baranovich fled for their lives. Wasserman advised his yeshiva students to regroup in then-independent Vilna, Lithuania. Kaplan and his family moved there and Kaplan studied there under Rabbi Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik. In June 1940, when the Soviet Union occupied Vilna, Jewish life became unbearable. Like the members of the Mir yeshiva and other refugees there, Kaplan sought visas to allow him to escape Nazi and Soviet rule. He obtained a de facto destination visa from the Dutch consul but was unable to obtain the necessary transit visa from Japanese Vice-consul, Chiune Sugihara that would allow his family to detour through Japan while awaiting some final, true destination. (Greenwald 1995:38) The family nevertheless boarded the trains to the Russian port city of Vladivostok. His son, Chaim Ozer, was born on the train ride. After entering Japanese territory by boat, Kaplan expected deportation back to Russia and eventually Siberia. Japanese officials goaded him to produce any kind of visa and he reluctantly showed them an obviously tampered Japanese transit visa. Inexplicably, it was stamped and accepted and the family continued on to Kobe and then later to Shanghai. (Greenwald 1995:39–40) His son Shimon was born in Shanghai, while his middle son, Chaim Ozer grew sick and died there. Chicago Kaplan arrived in America after the war and moved to Chicago, where his brother, Rabbi Hertzl Kaplan was teaching at the Chicago yeshiva that was to become the Hebrew Theological College. Reb Mendel accepted a teaching position there, though his students were English-speaking and his English was not yet mastered. He won the students over by offering to \\"teach them to read the Chicago Tribune if they taught him to read English.\\" His insights into world affairs and reading between the lines of the daily paper (even while needing help with the language) earned him his student's respect. (Greenwald 1995:44) When his girls were old enough for high school, his wife moved with them to Brooklyn New York, so they could attend a Jewish girls high school in Williamsburg. Kaplan started Kaplan's Winery Corporation, producing traditional Kosher Concord wine, in an effort to supplement his income to cover his daughter's tuition costs. (Greenwald 1995:47) Philadelphia By 1965, Kaplan had joined his family in New York and was invited to start teaching the first-level post-high school class in the Talmudical Yeshiva of Philadelphia. He accepted the position, lived in the dormitory and commuted each weekend to his wife and family in Brooklyn. He stayed at the school and taught the same level until his death on April 4, 1985.

History   Early years  Postcard marking 75th anniversary The Forbes and Wallace Store was constructed by partners Alexander B. Forbes and Andrew Brabner Wallace in 1873 at the corner of Main and Vernon (now Boland) Streets, Springfield, Massachusetts. In 1896 Forbes retired and Wallace became sole proprietor. In 1905 the Store consisted of eight floors and had grown into a complex of six buildings, taking up the entire city block. Forbes & Wallace was considered Springfield's leading retail establishment.  Expansion  In the 1940s through the early 1970s, Forbes & Wallace also ran several other department stores in Massachusetts and New York State under their original nameplates. In Massachusetts, stores were operated in nearby Holyoke as McCauslan Waklen, and in Northampton as McCallum's. McCallum's former location is now the site of the successful indoor Thornes Marketplace, which took over the vacant space in the late 1970s. The Boston Store in downtown North Adams, MA was also part of the Forbes & Wallace chain. In New York State, Wallace's department store in downtown Schenectady, NY, with branches in Kingston and Poughkeepsie, NY was also operated by Forbes & Wallace until it closed in 1975. Forbes & Wallace also operated store at Fairfield Mall, now the site of Home Depot, in Chicopee, MA. Forbes & Wallace and the now-defunct Two Guys were the low-rent mall's two anchor stores. The Forbes & Wallace at Fairfield Mall was closed in the mid-seventies, replaced by now-defunct Caldor. Two Guys, at the opposite end of the mall, also closed and it was replaced by now-defunct Bradlees. The mall, then faced with competition from the new and massive Holyoke Mall at Ingleside, went into a long period of decline. It closed in 2001 and was eventually torn down. The site is now a successful plaza featuring Home Depot, Staples, Sleepy's, a party shop and some other stores, anchored on the Bradlees side of the old mall with a Wal-Mart Super Center and ringed by Friendly's, Applebee's and a 99. Forbes & Wallace also had branch stores at the Eastfield Mall in Springfield, MA and opened a small store at the Manchester Parkade in Manchester, CT. The Eastfield Mall location served Springfield's affluent eastern and southeastern suburban areas and was a very popular shopping destination. The Manchester, CT location was not as successful, as it was located in a small shopping center some distance from Forbes & Wallace's normal trading area, and it competed unsuccessfully with the established Hartford, CT department stores G.

Förster-Nietzsche was two years younger than her brother. Their father was a Lutheran pastor in the German village of Röcken bei Lützen. The two children were close during their childhood and early adult years. However, they grew apart in 1885 when Elisabeth married Bernhard Förster, a former high school teacher who had become a prominent German nationalist and antisemite.See e.g. Nietzsche, Nice, end of December 1887: Draft of letter to Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche: ::In the meantime I've seen proof, black on white, that Herr Dr Förster has not yet severed his connection with the anti-Semitic movement. [...] Since then I've had difficulty coming up with any of the tenderness and protectiveness I've so long felt toward you. The separation between us is thereby decided in really the most absurd way. Have you grasped nothing of the reason why I am in the world? [...] Now it has gone so far that I have to defend myself hand and foot against people who confuse me with these anti-Semitic canaille; after my own sister, my former sister, and after Widemann more recently have given the impetus to this most dire of all confusions. After I read the name Zarathustra in the anti-Semitic Correspondence my forbearance came to an end. I am now in a position of emergency defense against your spouse's Party. These accursed anti-Semite deformities shall not sully my ideal!! Nice, end of December 1887: Draft of letter to Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche As his caretaker, Förster-Nietzsche assumed the roles of curator and editor of her brother's manuscripts. She reworked his unpublished writings to fit her own ideology, often in ways contrary to her brother's stated opinions. Through Förster-Nietzsche's editions, Nietzsche's name became associated with German militarism and National Socialism, while later 20th-century scholars have strongly disputed this conception of his ideas. Later in life, she became a member of the Nazi Party. When she died in 1935, Adolf Hitler attended her funeral.  Nueva Germania  Bernhard Förster planned to create a \\"pure Aryan settlement\\" in the New World, and had found a site in Paraguay which he thought would be suitable. The couple persuaded fourteen German families to join them in the colony, to be called Nueva Germania, and the group left Germany for South America on 15 February 1887. The colony did not thrive. The land was not suitable for German methods of farming, illness ran rampant, and transportation to the colony was slow and difficult. Faced with mounting debts, Förster committed suicide by poisoning himself on 3 June 1889. Four years later his widow left the colony forever and returned to Germany. The colony still exists as a district of the San Pedro department.  Nietzsche Archive  Friedrich Nietzsche's mental collapse occurred in 1889 (he died in 1900), and upon Elisabeth's return in 1893 she found him an invalid whose published writings were beginning to be read and discussed throughout Europe. Förster-Nietzsche took a leading role in promoting her brother, especially through the publication of a collection of Nietzsche's fragments under the name of The Will to Power.Martin Heidegger, 1930s courses on Nietzsche (parts of which have been published under the name Nietzsche I (1936-1939), ed. B. Schillbach, 1996, XIV, 596p. and Nietzsche II (1939-1946), ed. B. Schillbach, 1997, VIII, 454p.  note that these publications are not the exact transcription of the 1930s courses, but were done post-war), and Mazzino Montinari, 1974 (Montinari made the first complete edition of Nietzsche's posthumous fragments, respecting chronological orders, whilst Elisabeth Förster's edition was partial, incomplete and arbitrarily ordered, as Heidegger had already noted. Montinari's edition has provided the basis for all further scholarship on Nietzsche's work).  Affiliation with the National Socialist party  In 1930, Förster-Nietzsche, a German nationalist and antisemite, became a supporter of the National Socialist Party. After Hitler came to power in 1933, the Nietzsche Archive received financial support and publicity from the government, in return for which Förster-Nietzsche bestowed her brother's considerable prestige on the régime. Förster-Nietzsche's funeral in 1935 was attended by Hitler and several high-ranking German officials.

Its license was canceled and call sign deleted on December 23, 2010. History The station signed on in April 2002 as KBNM under the ownership of Sunbelt Communications Company. The station displaced K07HC, a translator for CBS affiliate KTVQ in Billings, Montana, to channel 9 as K09XK; in its earliest months, KBNM served as a temporary satellite of KTVQ, but with plans to become an NBC affiliate. After joining NBC, the station, which was renamed KSWY on November 1, 2002, served as a pass-through for NBC programming, with virtually no local content (including commercials); this ended on September 1, 2003, at which point it became a satellite of sister station KCWY in Casper, Wyoming (which joined NBC that same day). In 2008, Sunbelt exchanged KSWY to Western Family Television in exchange for KJCW-LP (channel 29), which had previously been listed as a JCTV affiliate. When the sale closed on May 9, 2009, KSWY went silent due to the loss of its tower site; its programming then moved to channel 29, renamed KSWY-LP. The KSWY callsign remained on channel 7 as well until May 4, 2010, when it took the KJCW callsign abandoned by KSWY-LP a year prior. The station proposed to return to the air (with the JCTV programming previously seen on KJCW-LP/KSWY-LP) from a temporary site as it continued to seek a permanent transmitter location. On December 23, 2010, the FCC canceled its license and deleted the KJCW call sign; its records indicated that the station did not return to the air within a year of May 9, 2009, triggering the automatic expiration of the KJCW license. As an affiliate of KTVQ, the station's transmitter was co-located with KPRQ 88.1 FM just off Red Grade Road southwest of Sheridan.

He had many celebrity clients, including Zsa Zsa Gabor, Errol Flynn, Chuck Berry, Muhammad Ali, The Rolling Stones, Jim Bakker and Tammy Faye Bakker, Martha Mitchell, Maureen Connolly, Lana Turner, Tony Curtis, and Mae West. During his legal career, he won over $600 million in damages for his clients. He was also the attorney for Jack Ruby, who shot Lee Harvey Oswald for the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Early life Belli was born in the California Gold Rush town of Sonora, California, in the Sierra Nevada foothills. His parents were of Italian ancestry from Switzerland. His grandmother, Anna Mouron, was the first female pharmacist in California. By the 1920s, the family had moved to the city of Stockton, California where Belli attended Stockton High School. Belli graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1929. After traveling around the world, he received his law degree from the Boalt Hall School of Law at Berkeley in 1933.http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/100002246806 Career Following his admission to the California bar, his first job was posing as a hobo for the Works Progress Administration and riding the rails to observe the Depression's impact on the country's vagrant population. His first major legal victory came shortly after graduation, in a personal injury lawsuit representing an injured cable car gripman. Over insurance lawyers' objections, Belli brought a model of a cable car intersection, and the gear box and chain involved in the accident, to demonstrate to jurors exactly what had happened. Besides his personal injury cases, which earned for him his byname \\"King of Torts,\\" Belli was instrumental in setting up some of the foundations of modern consumer rights law, arguing several cases in the 1940s and 1950s that formed the basis for later lawsuits and landmark litigation by such figures as Ralph Nader. Belli argued (in cases such as Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., in 1944, which arose from an incident in which a restaurant waitress from Merced, California was injured by an exploding Coca-Cola bottle) that all products have an implied warranty, that it is to be foreseen that products will be used by a long chain of people, not just the direct recipient of the manufactured product, and that negligence by a defendant need not be proven if the defendant's product is defective. Clown Alley, 1964 In his book Ready for the Plaintiff, Belli noted examples of negligence cited by himself and other personal-injury lawyers to win in court—for example, a colleague in Florida, who showed how a builder violated a building code in Miami Beach concerning the use of wooden shims in construction of outside walls (forbidden by the municipal code because of the effect of the ocean salt and air). The facing was a slab of Vitreous marble, whose adhesion was eventually weakened by the climate; it fell off the side of the building and injured a passerby, who sued the builder. After winning a court case, Belli would raise a Jolly Roger flag over his Montgomery Street office building in the Barbary Coast district of San Francisco (which Belli claimed had been a Gold Rush-era brothel) and fire a cannon, mounted on his office roof, to announce the victory and the impending party. In his best-known case, Belli represented Jack Ruby, for free, after Ruby shot and killed Lee Harvey Oswald. Belli attempted to prove that Ruby was legally insane and had a history of mental illness in his family. On Saturday, March 14, 1964, Ruby was convicted of \\"murder with malice\\", and received a death sentence. Immediately thereafter, Ruby and his siblings fired Belli as they also hired and fired several other lawyers during the case. In late 1966, Ruby's conviction was overturned with help from other defense lawyers on the grounds that he did not receive a fair trial and a retrial was scheduled outside of Dallas, but Ruby died of cancer before the retrial could take place. Belli became very critical of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. In 1969 a man called San Francisco police, identifying himself as the serial killer known only as The Zodiac, and agreed to call talk show host Jim Dunbar on Dunbar's morning television talk show, A.M. San Francisco if either Belli or attorney F. Lee Bailey were present on air. The police contacted Belli and Dunbar to arrange this in the hopes of capturing the individual. As promised, the suspect called, spoke a few words, and then hung up, repeating this activity 54 times over the next two hours.Whiting, Sam (June 27, 2000). \\"Last Call / Innovator Jim Dunbar retiring after 37 years at KGO Newstalk radio\\". San Francisco Chronicle. Belli received a letter from the Zodiac that same year. Belli's firm filed for bankruptcy protection in December 1995. Belli was representing 800 women in a class action lawsuit against breast implant manufacturer Dow Corning. Belli won the lawsuit, but when Dow Corning declared bankruptcy, Belli had no way to recover the $5 million his firm had advanced to doctors and expert witnesses. In the 1960s, Belli was among the leading members of the California plaintiffs bar who helped establish the California Trial Lawyers Association, which in the mid-1990s was renamed the Consumer Attorneys of California. The organization was established to help set standards and foment on-going legal education to help consumers have a better chance in court against the powerful legal teams amassed by the insurance companies and big corporations that typically were the defendants in accident, personal injury and other consumer lawsuits. In media Belli executive produced Tokyo File 212 (1951), Hollywood's first film to be shot entirely in Japan. It featured Florence Marly and Robert Peyton in key roles. Belli enjoyed his frequent television and movie appearances; in 1965, he told Alex Haley, interviewing him for Playboy, that he \\"might have been an actor\\" if he had not become an attorney. Belli appeared in \\"And the Children Shall Lead\\", a 1968 episode of the original Star Trek series. In it he appears as \\"Gorgan, the Friendly Angel\\", an evil being who corrupts a group of children, one of whom was played by his son Caesar. He appeared in the Albert and David Maysles documentary Gimme Shelter (1970), which featured his representation and facilitation of The Rolling Stones' staging of the disastrous December 6, 1969, Altamont Free Concert. In 1986 he played a criminal defense lawyer in an episode of the TV series Hunter entitled \\"True Confessions.\\" David Woodard and Belli rehearsing oratory for \\"The War Prayer\\" in 1996 In 1996 Belli recited the oratory to David Woodard's brass fanfare setting of Mark Twain's \\"The War Prayer\\" at Old First Church in San Francisco.David Woodard—\\"The War Prayer\\" Belli was played by Brian Cox in the 2007 film Zodiac, in the scene that depicted Belli's conversation with the Zodiac suspect on A.M. San Francisco. Author Belli was the author of several books, including the six-volume Modern Trials (written between 1954 and 1960) which has become a classic textbook on the demonstrative method of presenting evidence. Belli's unprecedented — and some thought undignified — use of graphic evidence and expert witnesses later became common courtroom practice. His autobiography, My Life on Trial is an account of his life and the noteworthy events he was involved in during his career. He also wrote the introduction to \\"847.0 The Whiplash Injury\\" by L. Ted Frigard, D.C. published in 1970. Dr. Frigard had helped Belli with his pain through chiropractic care. Personal life Belli was married six times and divorced five. His marriage to his fifth wife, the former Lia Georgia Triff, ended with a scandalous and acrimonious divorce proceeding in 1991. Belli accused his ex-wife of having an affair with archbishop Desmond Tutu and of throwing one of his dogs off the Golden Gate Bridge. He was fined $1,000 for repeatedly calling her \\"El Trampo\\". At one point, Belli was ejected from the courtroom after accusing the judge of sleeping with his former wife's lawyer.Melvin Belli: Court Lion Fighting in His Own Lair - New York Times He was ultimately compelled to pay her an estimated $15 million. She later married a self-styled Romanian prince, Prince Paul of Romania. Belli married his sixth wife, Nancy Ho, on March 29, 1996. His youngest child, Melia, from fifth wife Lia, became an art history scholar, and is currently an assistant professor of Asian art history at the University of Texas at Arlington. Death Belli died of complications from pancreatic cancer, at his home in San Francisco, on July 9, 1996, aged 88. His death came suddenly, and in the presence of his wife Nancy. The New York Times' quoted his publicist Edward Lozzi saying, \\"He was sitting; he just stopped breathing\\". At the time of his death, he had three sons, three daughters, twelve grandchildren, and two dogs. He is buried in Odd Fellows Cemetery in Sonora, California, his birthplace.

On March 22, 1906, the first passenger train from Cobre to Currie was operated. Between 1906 and 1941, approximately 4.6 million passengers passed through Currie on rail. The Ely copper smelters were closed on June 20, 1983 and the railroad closed one day later. The major portion of the town, the business district (20 acres), is owned by Glenn, Robert, and wife Brenda Taylor, who now reside in Utah. It consists of Goshute Mercantile, the bar, adjoining house, cabins, RV park, garage, historic buildings, and corrals. There is also the Nevada Northern Railway, Elko County School District - Currie Elementary school, Lear Ranch and the Nevada Highway Department. The Taylors wish to sell their part of the town.

It was founded as a German settlement on 23 August 1887 by Bernhard Förster, a German nationalist, who was married to Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, sister of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Förster's idea was to create a model community in the New World and to demonstrate the supremacy of German culture and society. Förster committed suicide after the settlement's initial failure. It is located about 297 kilometres from Asunción, capital of the Republic of Paraguay.  History  Nueva Germania was founded in 1886 on the banks of the Aguaray-Guazú River, about 250 kilometres from Asunción by five, later fourteen, largely impoverished families from Saxony. Led by Bernhard Förster and his wife, Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, the German colonists emigrated to the Paraguayan rainforest to put to practice utopian ideas about the superiority of the Aryan race. It was the declared dream of Förster to create an area of Germanic development, far from the influence of Jews, whom he reviled. The colony's development was hampered by the harshness of the environment, a lack of proper supplies and an overconfidence of the colonist's own supposed aryan supremacy. Most settlers soon died of starvation and disease. Those who survived malaria and the sand-flea infections rushed to flee Nueva Germania. Those who stayed, convinced of their founder's teachings, married among themselves as to preserve the racial stock. To this day the consequences of inbreeding are visible, with high incidence of mental problems and physical malformations. Förster, who had negotiated the town's titles of property with General Bernardino Caballero, committed suicide in 1889 in the city of San Bernardino after abandoning the settlers. Elisabeth Nietzsche returned to Germany in 1893. According to Gerard L. Posner, writing in Mengele: The Complete Story, Josef Mengele, a major German war criminal, spent some time in Nueva Germania while a fugitive after World War II; however, evidence that Mengele even passed through is shaky at best. Nueva Germania became a quiet community of San Pedro, dedicated to agriculture, specializing in the cultivation of yerba mate. Beginning in 2004 the American writer David Woodard embarked on a series of expeditions to the erstwhile colony.Epstein, J., \\"Rebuilding a Home in the Jungle\\", San Francisco Chronicle, Mar 13, 2005.Kracht, C., & Woodard, D., Five Years (Hanover: Wehrhahn Verlag, 2011). As of 2013 pockets of German culture remained. Most of the population in the area still only speak a mix of German and Guaraní.  Economy  Cassava plant One of the most important products of the district is yerba mate, along with sugarcane, cotton, manioc (cassava), tobacco, sunflower, soy, wheat, banana, sweet and sour orange, Paraguayan lemon verbena and sesame.  Transportation  A branch of Route No. 3 General Elizardo Aquino, a paved road, is the main access to the town, which connects it with Asunción and other localities of the department. Also, Route No. 11 Juana Maria de Lara, an unpaved road, connects the town with the Amambay Department. Other unimproved roads (of sand or pebbles) connect with different districts and the capital of the department.  Climate  The climate is tropical, with abundant rains, a maximum temperature of about 35 °C, a minimum of 10 °C and an average of 23 °C, with a humidity of 80%. Precipitation exceeds 1300 millimeters, especially in summer.  Language  The Guaraní language is predominant; about 80% of the population speak it; the rest speak a combination of German and Guaraní.  Population  Nueva Germania town (1891) The General Directorate of Statistics, Polls and Census reports the following numbers with regard to population: * In 1992 the district had 17,148 inhabitants, the majority of whom lived in the Town of Santa Rosa del Aguaray. In 2002 Santa Rosa del Aguaray became a municipality in its own right. Consequently, the District of Nueva Germania lost most of its population and territory, though it retained the Mennonite colony Rio Verde to the north of Santa Rosa del Aguaray. * The population is mostly rural and occupied in agricultural activities. * The projected net population by gender for 2002 is 4,335 inhabitants (2,323 men and 2,012 women). As of 2002, about 10% of Nueva Germania's inhabitants were of mainly German origin.Evangelische Gemeinde Düren Brochure by the Protestant Parish of Düren (in German), contains pictures.  Borders  Nueva Germania borders: * At North: on Tacuatí district. * At South: on Lima district, separated from it for the Aguaray Guazú River. * At East: on Amambay department and the Santa Rosa del Aguaray district. * At West: on San Pedro de Ycuamandiyú district and the Tacuati district.  Hydrography  Nueva Germania district is watered by the rivers Aguaray Guazú and Aguaray mí and the streams Tutytí and Empalado.  Demographics  Main social and demographic indicators: * Total fertility rate: 3.4 * Percentage of illiteracy in the district: 15.4% * Percentage of housings that have power: 82.0% * Percentage of housings that have running water: 39.6% * Percentage of population that are under the age of 15: 39% * Percentage of population that have access to modern housing: 41.2% * Percentage of population that have access to modern sanitation: 20.9% * Percentage of population that have access to modern educational programs: 13.5% * Percentage of population that are employed in the primary sector of the economy: 60.1% * Percentage of population that are employed in the secondary sector of the economy: 14.3% * Percentage of population that are employed in the tertiary sector of the economy: 25.0%  See also  * Germans in Paraguay  References   External links and further reading  * Ben Macintyre, Forgotten Fatherland: The True Story of Nietzsche's Sister and Her Lost Aryan Colony, Broadway (April 5, 2011), trade paperback, 304 pages * New York Times, Nueva Germania, 1991 * New York Times, Nueva Germania, 2013 * Brochure by the Protestant Parish of Dueren (in German), contains pictures * Blog on Nueva Germania with photos * World Gazeteer: Paraguay - World- Gazetteer.com * Dialog International — \\"Dick Cheney and Nueva Germania\\" * (article deleted) * The Walrus article has been deleted, but has been reproduced in this Word Press Blog * Sussman, Nadia and Simon Romero, 2013, \\"A Lost Colony in Paraguay\\" Video: \\"A Lost Tribe in Paraguay\\" * Kraus, Daniela, Bernhard und Elisabeth Försters Nueva Germania in Paraguay.

Stevens attended Wesley College, Perth and played in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) with Perth before being recruited to the Sydney Swans. He failed to play a match in his first two seasons with Sydney and finally made his AFL debut in 2002. After four years on Sydney's list, Stevens was traded to the Adelaide Crows for the 2004 season. After a solid first year at his new club, foot and shoulder injuries kept him sidelined for the entire 2005 season and 2006 pre-season. He returned to the side in Round 2 but did not perform and was dropped again. In round 7, however, he was given another chance and this time succeeded in becoming a regular player, playing all bar one of the remaining games and averaging over 18 disposals at centre half-back. Stevens played every game in 2007, stationed in a variety of positions. However, former Adelaide coach Malcolm Blight criticised Stevens' skills when under pressure. In 2008, Stevens capped off another consistent season by coming eighth in the AFC Club Champion award, and kicking six goals in the elimination final loss to Collingwood. In 2009, Stevens continued to be a reliable member of the Adelaide side. The absence of regular centre half-back Nathan Bock through suspension and injury led to Stevens being played more in defence, a role that Stevens performed admirably, and he was able to kick goals when required in the forward line. In round 3 of the 2011 season Stevens suffered a concussion injury. Stevens retired on 21 June 2011 due to the cumulative effects of numerous concussions. Due to his unpredictable and unconventional playing style, Stevens was immensely popular among most AFC fans. Many considered him to be a cult hero at the time of his retirement in 2011.

Missions Rudger Clawson (left) and Joseph Standing (right) 1879. Standing's first mission call, in 1875, was to the Eastern United States where he primarily served in Illinois and Indiana. In March 1878 he was again called to missionary service, this time to the church's Southern States Mission, headquartered in Chattanooga, Tennessee. During an August mission conference in Haywood Valley, Chattooga County, Georgia, Standing, along with fellow missionary Matthias F. Cowley, were sustained as the 'traveling Elders' of the Southern States Mission.\\"Southern States Conference,\\" Editorial Notes, Deseret News, September 11, 1878 p. 7 By April 1879 Standing was the presiding Elder of the Georgia Conference, responsible for overseeing all church affairs in the state. That same month, at a general conference of the church in Salt Lake City, 22-year-old Rudger Clawson was called with seven other men to serve in the Southern States Mission. Clawson was assigned by mission president John Hamilton Morgan to be Standing's companion. Clawson may have been aware of the church's situation in Georgia prior to his arrival. By at least 1876, Standing's letters were periodically published in the Deseret Evening News. One published on April 30, 1878 provides insight into his experiences in the post-Reconstruction South; > A person traveling among the Southern people realizes that though they have > been whipped by the North, yet there is a feeling of enmity existing in > their bosoms, which only needs a little breeze to inflame their passions to > deeds of carnage and strife.Standing, Joseph \\"The Work in the South, Haywood > Valley Georgia\\", Deseret Evening News, April 30, 1878. For additional > letters see \\"Last Letter from Elder Joseph Standing\\", Deseret News, August > 13, 1879. Local opposition to Mormonism increased as Standing and other elders increasingly gained converts in rural areas in North Georgia. Mormon missionaries were seen by some as spiritual carpetbaggers, deceivers who preyed on the poor and uneducated.\\"In Brigham's Bosom,\\" The Atlanta Constitution, August 7, 1879. The majority of those who were baptized into the faith followed the church's council to \\"gather with the Saints\\" and left their homes for Mormon settlements in Utah and Colorado. Joseph Brown, former Georgia Governor (1857–1865) and future U.S. Senator (1880–1891), told the New York Herald; > In traveling through the section about Dalton, embracing particularly the > lower part of Chatooga, the upper part of Floyd and Walker, Catoosa and > Murray counties, I was astonished to find what a hold the Mormons have on > various communities.

Colquitt on June 12, 1879 briefly outlining the activities of armed mobs in Whitfield County and requesting assistance. > I am fully aware dear Sir, that the popular prejudice is very much against > the Mormons, and that there are minor officers who have apparently winked at > the condition of affairs above referred to.

Mobbing and death On July 21, 1879, Standing and Clawson were leaving Varnell for Rome, Georgia (approximately south of Varnell) when they were accosted by an armed mob of a dozen men. Most were on foot; at least three were on horseback. When Standing asked by what authority they were stopped on a public road, one member of the mob reportedly told them; > The government of the United States is against you, and there is no law in > Georgia for Mormons. The mob led them into woods and stopped at a spring. It does not appear that it was the intention of all in the mob to kill them. James Faucett told them; \\"I want you men to understand that I am the captain of this party, and that if we ever again find you in this part of the country we will hang you by the neck like dogs.\\" According to Clawson, after an hour of \\"desultory conversation… of which the vilest accusations were laid against the \\"Mormons,\\" [and] the beastly talk of the mobbers,\\" three men who had left on horseback returned and directed Standing and Clawson to go with them. Although it is not clear where they intended to take them, all accounts agree that Standing resisted by turning towards the mob and in a loud voice commanded them to \\"Surrender.\\" When he made this declaration he was holding a pistol a member of the mob had left unguarded on a nearby tree stump.\\"The Murder of Elder Joseph Standing.\\" Millennial Star, August 25, 1879. In response, Standing was immediately shot in forehead \\"directly above the nose\\". Another member of the mob then pointed to Clawson and said \\"Shoot that man.\\" Clawson folded his arms and said \\"Shoot.\\" Although he appeared calm and maintained composure, he nearly passed out in the anxiety of the moment. For reasons unknown, the same man who moments ago told the mob to shoot Clawson now said \\"Don't shoot.\\" As Clawson examined Standing, one man said; \\"This is terrible; that he should have killed himself in such a manner,\\" claiming that Standing accidentally shot himself \\"while bringing his weapon into position.\\" Clawson convinced the group that he should leave for help to remove Standing's body. He contacted Henry Holston, two miles (3 km) away, and Holston agreed to go to the site of the incident and look after Standing's body while Clawson rode a horse to Catoosa Springs to contact the coroner (approximately from Holston's home). Before returning with the coroner, Clawson sent the following telegram to Governor Colquitt in Atlanta; \\"Joseph Standing was shot and killed to-day, near Varnell's, by a mob of ten or twelve men.\\" He sent the same message to John Hamilton Morgan in Salt Lake City with the additional line; \\"Will leave for home with the body at once, Notify his family.\\" When they reached the spring, the mob had dispersed and a crowd of spectators were gathered around Standing's body. The body now had more than 20 bullet wounds in the face and neck. It is believed this was done by the mob to protect the original shooter from conviction by having each man participate in the crime. Following the shooting the Atlanta Constitution called Standing \\"fat and beardless, and with not a very bright look, judging from his picture\\" and reported that those in the community became \\"alarmed for fear some member of their family might fall a victim to the seductive arguments and pleadings of the young Mormon[s]… [their] services were regularly attended by those who every week became more and more inoculated with the pernicious creed.\\"\\"In Brigham's Bosom,\\" The Atlanta Constitution, August 7, 1879. In spite of this perception Clawson told a reporter he believed the actions of the mob were not in harmony with the sentiments of the general population. Funeral Salt Lake Tabernacle, 1870s. Clawson accompanied Standing's body back to Utah by train and funeral services were held in the Salt Lake Tabernacle on Sunday, August 3, 1879. Speakers included John Taylor and George Q. Cannon. Approximately 10,000 attended the service.\\"The Funeral Services of Elder Joseph Standing\\", Deseret News, August 6, 1879 reported 10,000. \\"In Brigham's Bosom\\", The Atlanta Constitution, August 7, 1879, reported 5,000. In 1879 seating capacity in the Tabernacle was 12,000.

Standing was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery. Trial On August 1, 1879, eleven days after the shooting, Governor Colquitt offered a $500.00 reward for \\"the capture of the murders of the Mormon elder\\" accompanying the thirteen warrants for arrest issued by the local Sheriff.\\"Standing's Assassins $500 Reward for their Capture\\", Salt Lake Herald, August 9, 1879. Andrew Bradley, Jasper P. Nations, and Hugh Blair were indicted by a grand jury for first degree murder and riot. Accompanied by John Morgan, Clawson returned to Dalton, Georgia for the trial in October. Henry Holston, Mary Hamlin, and Jonathan Owensby testified in behalf of the prosecution. The latter two interacted with the mob while Standing and Clawson were in the mob's custody prior to the shooting. Numerous witnesses testified for the defense, and it was widely understood that most of them were lying. On October 19, three days after the trial began, the accused were acquitted of murder.\\"Participating in the Crime,\\" Deseret News, October 22, 1879 p. 8. On October 29 the Deseret News reported that the accused had also been acquitted of \\"riot.\\"\\"Murderers Encouraged,\\" Deseret News, October 29, 1879 p. 8. The Atlanta Constitution reported that seven of the twelve men were Christians and at least one a member in good standing in a local church. John Morgan wrote to the paper; \\"If these men are Christians; if they and their advisers and abettors are to be admitted into the city that \\"lieth four square,\\" we beg the privilege of locating in the other place, as we think it much preferable.\\" The paper replied; > We agree with Elder Morgan in his sentiments about the pious \\"Christians,\\" > recognized members and communicants of churches who imbrue their hands in > the blood of innocence and mutilate the dead. If heaven is to be their place > of abode in the great hereafter region, we shall prefer a home in another > region, where murders cannot enter and hypocrites find no rest.\\"Comments > from Georgia,\\" Deseret News, November 5, 1879 p. 8. Standing's legacy The story of Standing's murder lived on in the life of Rudger Clawson. In 1898, Clawson was appointed to the church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the second highest ecclesiastical body in the church, a position he held until his death in 1943. Clawson's high profile life in Utah, and among Mormons generally, gave opportunity for commentators to look to the events in his life that may have shaped his faith in a God and his commitment to the church. He was regularly asked to tell the story of Standing's death, and references were made to the event by church leaders in conferences of the church for decades. The story of Rudger Clawson can not be separated from the story of Standing. In 1880, the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association of Salt Lake City placed a monument of Italian marble over Standing's grave in the Salt Lake City Cemetery. By the 1980s the obelisk had cracked in half and rested beside the grave. It was replaced in 2001 with a new marker, a replica of the original, including iron fencing around the base.Joseph Standing grave , Online Collections at BYU; see also \\"The Standing Monument\\" Deseret News, July 30, 1880.

In a 2019 critical study, Beat scholar Raj Chandarlapaty revisits and examines Woodard's “idea-shattering” approach to the near-forgotten Dreamachine.Chandarlapaty, R., \\"Woodard and Renewed Intellectual Possibilities\\", in Seeing the Beat Generation (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Company, 2019), pp. 98–101. The Dreamachine is the subject of the National Film Board of Canada 2008 feature documentary film FLicKeR, by Nik Sheehan.Official film promo website. Use A Dreamachine is \\"viewed\\" with the eyes closed: the pulsating light stimulates the optic nerve and thus alters the brain's electrical oscillations. As users adjust to the experience, they see increasingly complex animated yantra-like patterns of color behind their closed eyelids (similar effects may be seen when travelling as a passenger in a car or bus; close your eyes as the vehicle passes through the flickering shadows cast by regularly spaced roadside trees, streetlights or tunnel striplights—these were the hypnagogic effects Brion Gysin said he sought to recreate with the device). It is claimed that by using a Dreamachine meditatively, users enter an alphawave, or hypnagogic state. This experience may sometimes be quite intense, but to escape from it, one needs only to open one's eyes. The Dreamachine may be dangerous for persons with photosensitive epilepsy or other nervous disorders. It is thought that one out of 10,000 adults will experience a seizure while viewing the device; about twice as many children will have a similar ill effect. See also *Brainwave entrainment *Jan E.

They have a total land area of 78 km2. The main island is known as Karimun (2,700 ha), while the second-largest island is Kemujan (1,400 ha). In 2011, the population of the island group was about 9,000 who lived on five of the islands. The population is largely Javanese, with pockets of Bugis and Madurese inhabitants. Javanese culture is dominant in the islands which are the only islands off Java where Javanese is the lingua franca.Peter Milne, 'Karimunjawa: Java's One and Only Island Paradise', The Jakarta Post, 8 January 2012. Twenty-two of the islands have been declared 2001 as a marine reserve, the Karimunjawa National Park. Five more islands are either privately owned or are under the control of the Indonesian Navy. The archipelago is served by Dewadaru Airport which provides scheduled airline services to Semarang and Surabaya. Islands and administration The Karimunjawa islands comprise a district (kecamatan) which is made up of five villages (Karimun, Kamagin, Kemujan, Digimon, and Parang) and forms a part of the Jepara Regency (kabupaten) of Central Java province. The island of Bawean lies east of this group, and is part of Gresik Regency, in East Java province. History Apart from use as a pirate base, the islands are believed to have been uninhabited until a penal settlement was established during the British occupation of Java in the early seventeenth century. Archeological finds of Chinese ceramics on the seabed near the islands which date from around the 13th century suggest that the islands were once part of a trade route to Java.Suherdjoko, 'Karimunjawa part of an ancient trade route: Archeological find', The Jakarta Post, 3 August 2009. The settlement was abandoned by the Dutch during the Java War of 1825–1830, but the former convicts remained as settlers. Cotton plantations set up during the convict period became a major source of income, as did goldsmithing. The islands were declared a national park in 1988.Tifa Asrianti, 'Charm of the Karimun Jawa Islands', The Jakarta Post, 9 December 2012. Geology and climate The archipelago consists predominantly of pre- Tertiary continental islands primarily of quartzites and shales covered by basaltic lava. Geologically, the islands are part of Sundaland. The islands have extensive fringing and patchy coral reefs. The best time to visit the islands is during the dry season, generally from April to October. Economy The main source of income for the local population is fishing, followed by services and commerce. Travel to the islands from Java is sometimes limited during the rainy season around the January–March period during bad weather which can bring large waves to the area.Suherdjoko, ' There are a number of snorkeling spots. There is pressure on local environmental resources because of the rapidly expanding tourist industry.

Canopy Meg (born December 23, 1953) is an American biologist, educator, ecologist, writer, explorer, and public speaker. Her expertise involves canopy ecology, canopy ecology canopy plant-insect relationships, and constructing canopy walkways. Nicknamed the \\"real-life Lorax\\" and \\"Einstein of the treetops\\", Lowman pioneered the science of canopy ecology. She is known as the \\"mother of canopy research.\\" For more than 30 years, she has designed hot-air balloons and walkways for treetop exploration to solve mysteries in the world's forests, especially insect pests and ecosystem health. She works to map the canopy for biodiversity and to champion forest conservation around the world. Lowman's academic training includes Williams College (BA, Biology) in 1976; Aberdeen University (MSc, Ecology) in 1978; Sydney University (Ph.D, Botany); and Tuck School of Business (Executive Management). Research Lowman has authored more than 100 peer-reviewed scientific publications and several books including Life in the Treetops (1999) and It's a Jungle Up There (2006). From 1978-1989 Lowman lived in Oofsquad and worked on canopy research in rain forests and dry forests. She was instrumental in determining the cause of Eucalypt Dieback Syndrome in Australia, and worked with forest conservation and regeneration. She taught at Williams College in Massachusetts, pioneering many aspects of forest canopy research. During her time there she spearheaded the construction of the first canopy walkway in North America. Work Lowman currently serves as the Director of Global Initiatives and Senior Scientist for Plant Conservation at the California Academy of Sciences. Her role is to strategize and promote the Academy’s mission for sustainability science, and to disseminate her team’s accomplishments to groups ranging from elementary classes to corporate executives to international conferences. Lowman previously served as Chief of Science & Sustainability at the California Academy of Sciences. In this role, Lowman was responsible for the Academy's programs of scientific research and exploration as well as its programs addressing the challenge of sustaining life on earth. She led their twenty-first century strategy of integrating research with sustainability initiatives both local and global. As the Academy’s inaugural Chief of Science and Sustainability, she re-organized internal operations to prioritize relevant science, sustainability, collections and efficient financial practices. Prior to this Lowman was a Research Professor at North Carolina State University and the founding director of North Carolina’s innovative Nature Research Center at the NC Museum of Natural Sciences. Lowman oversaw the creation, construction, staffing, and programming of this research wing in partnership with the NC University system. She was then promoted to Senior Scientist/Director of Academic Partnerships & Global Initiatives for the entire Museum. She served as the primary advocate for NRC and aimed to promote its mission. She has served as Vice President of the Ecological Society of America; Treasurer of the Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation; Executive Director of the TREE Foundation; Board of Directors for The Explorers Club and Earthwatch; and former Climate Change Adviser to Alex Sink, CFO of the Florida cabinet. Previously, she served as Director of Environmental Initiatives at New College of Florida, CEO of The Marie Selby Botanical Gardens, and Professor of Biology and Environmental Studies at Williams College. Lowman believes in conservation through education which is a very strong theme in her most recent book It's a Jungle Up There. She has been involved in several JASON Project education programs and numerous other conservation education initiatives. Her books on canopy ecology are not just about her field work but add dimensions in what it's like to be a woman in a male dominated profession, and what it's like to be a single parent mom. Her sons co-authored It's a Jungle Up There and added their insights on how their mother's career and their family not only survived, but thrived. Her youngest son, James Burgess, went on to co-found the organization OpenBiome. Organizations In 1999 Lowman became the Executive Director of Marie Selby Botanical Gardens in Sarasota, Florida where she helped raise donations over 100 percent and increased membership by \\"friend-raising\\". The Selby Garden's lecture series \\"Tuesdays In The Tropics\\" was well attended by the community with topics such as \\"Does Money Grow on Trees? Challenges of Rain Forest Conservation\\". During her tenure, the Gardens' budget shifted into the black from previous years and the membership more than doubled. When the board shifted away from a botanical and conservation-oriented mission, Lowman accepted an offer at New College of Florida as Professor of Biology and Environmental Studies. The Center for Canopy Ecology relocated from Selby Gardens to New College following Lowman. Lowman co-founded the TREE Foundation, along with Sarasota non-profit accountant Mike Pender and community leader, Bob Richardson. She still serves as its Executive Director, and the Foundation supports Tree Research, Exploration, and Education (hence, TREE). The Foundation has supported scholarships for students from developing countries to learn about forest conservation in the U.S., built the Myakka River canopy walkway (America's first public treetop walk), conserved valuable forest fragments in Ethiopia with a unique science-religion partnership, and continuously promotes education of youth about forest conservation. Canopy access Lowman has developed an expertise for using different canopy access techniques such as slingshot fired ropes, hot air balloons with sleds, canopy cranes, and canopy walkways. In 2000 the Myakka River State Park canopy walkway opened after a 1997 proposal from Lowman. It includes a walkway through Florida Oak-Palm Hammock and a tower that reveals a \\"sea of green\\" above the treetops. It has given visitors a view of the trees that changes people's perspective on the importance of forest conservation.

Hell. 1.2. 18: Diod. 12.77, 15.57; Ἡρακλεῶται οἱ ἐν Τραχῖνι, Thuc. 5.51; Ἡ Ἡράκλεια ἡ Τραχὶν καλουμένη πρότερον, Strab. ix. p.428; Heraclea Trachin dicta, Plin. Nat. 4.7. s. 14; H. Φθιώτιδος, Ptol. 3.13.46. was a colony founded by the Spartans in 426 BC, the sixth year of the Peloponnesian War. It was also a polis (city-state). Situation Originally called Trachis (Τραχίς), or by Strabo, Trachin (Τραχίν), the city was in the region of Malis, in the district called after, it Trachinia. It was located on a rocky plateau above the left bank of the Asopos River, at the point where it leaves Mount Oeta for the plain of Lamia. It stood in a little to the north or rather west of Thermopylae, thus commanding the approach to Thermopylae from Thessaly, and was, from its position, of great military importance. The entrance to the Trachinian plain was only half a plethrum [] in breadth, but the surface of the plain was 22,000 plethra [], according to Herodotus. The same writer states that the city Trachis was 5 stadia from the river Melas, and that the river Asopus issued from a gorge in the mountains, to the south of Trachis. According to Thucydides, Trachis was 40 stadia from Thermopylae and 20 from the sea. Trachis (as Trachin) is mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad by Homer as one of the cities subject to Achilles, and is celebrated in the legends of Heracles as the scene ofthis hero's death.Sophocles, Trach. passim. History It became a place of historical importance in consequence of the colony founded here by the Lacedaemonians in the sixth year of the Peloponnesian War, 426 BC. The Trachinians (a tribe of the Malians) and the neighbouring Dorians, who suffered much from the predatory incursions of the Oetaean mountaineers, solicited aid from the Spartans, who eagerly availed themselves of this opportunity to plant a strong colony in this commanding situation. They issued an invitation to the other Dorian states of Greece to join in the colony; and as many as 10,000 colonists, under three Spartan oecists (Leon, Alcidas, and Damagon), built and fortified a new town, to which the name of Heraclea was given, from the great hero, whose name was so closely associated with the surrounding district. It was usually called the Trachinian Heraclea, to distinguish it from other places of the same name, and by later writers Heraclea in Phthiotis (Ἡράκλεια Φθιώτιδος), as this district was subsequently included in the Thessalian Phthiotis. Thucydides also tells us that the Spartans thought the town would \\"lie conveniently for the purposes of the war with Athens.\\" From Heraclea the Spartans could ready a fleet to threaten Euboea, and the town would be \\"a useful station on the road to Thrace.\\" The new colonists also built a port with docks near Thermopylae. It was generally expected that this city. under the protection of Sparta, would become a formidable power in Northern Greece; however, soon after the town was founded, things began to go quite badly. It was attacked from the beginning by the Thessalians, who regarded its establishment as an invasion of their territory; and the Spartans, who rarely succeeded in the government of dependencies, displayed haughtiness and corruption in its administration. Hence the city rapidly dwindled down. Six years after its founding a battle took place between the inhabitants of Heraclea and the assembled forces of the Aenianes, Dolopes, Malians, and Thessalians who were directly menaced by the colony. Sparta was unable at the time to send assistance to their colony; the Heracleots were defeated, and the town so reduced that in the following year, the Boeotians occupied it to prevent it falling into Athenian hands, and dismissed the Lacedaemonian governor, on the ground of misconduct. Thucydides tells us that the Spartans were \\"offended at the Boeotians for what they had done.\\" The Lacedaemonians, however, regained possession of the place; and in the winter of 409-408 BC, they experienced here another disaster, 700 of the Heracleots being slain in battle, together with the Lacedaemonian harmost (military governor). But, after the Peloponnesian War, Heraclea again rose into importance, and became the headquarters of the Spartan power in Northern Greece. In 399 BC, Herippidas the Lacedaemonian, was sent there to repress some factious movements in Heraclea ; and he not only put to death all the opponents of the Lacedaemonians in the town, but expelled the neighbouring Oetaeans and Trachinians from their abodes.Polyaenus, 2.21; In 395 BC, the Thebans, under the command of Ismenias, wrested this important place from the Spartans, killed the Lacedaemonian garrison, and gave the city to the old Trachinian and Oetaean inhabitants. The walls of Heraclea were destroyed by Jason of Pherae, lest any state should seize this place and prevent him from marching into Greece. At a later time Heraclea came into the hands of the Aetolians, and was one of the main sources of their power in Northern Greece. After the defeat of Antiochus III at the Battle of Thermopylae (191 BC), Heraclea was besieged by the Roman consul Acilius Glabrio, who divided his army into four bodies, and directed his attacks upon four points at once; one body being stationed on the river Asopus, where was the gymnasium; the second near the citadel outside of the walls (extra muros), which was almost more thickly inhabited than the city itself; the third towards the Maliac Gulf; and the fourth on the river Melas, opposite the temple of Diana. The country around was marshy, and abounded in lofty trees. After a siege of twenty-four days the Romans succeeded in taking the town, and the Aetolians retired to the citadel. On the following day the consul seized a rocky summit, equal to the citadel in height, and separated from it only by a chasm so narrow that the two summits were within reach of a missile. Thereupon the Aetolians surrendered the citadel. William Martin Leake, who visited the site in the early 19th century, remarks that it seems quite clear from this account of Livy that the city occupied the low ground between the rivers Karvunariá (Asopus) and Mavra-Néria (Melas), extending from the one to the other, as well as a considerable distance into the plain in a south-eastern direction. There are still some vestiges of the citadel upon a lofty rock above; and upon its perpendicular sides there are many catacombs excavated. \\"The distance of the citadel above the town justifies the words extra muros, which Livy applies to it, and may explain also the assertion of Strabo,[] that Heraclea was six stadia distant from the ancient Trachis; for, although the town of Heraclea seems to have occupied the same position as the Trachis of Herodotus, the citadel, which, according to Livy, was better inhabited in the Aetolian War than the city, may very possibly have been the only inhabited part of Heraclea two centuries later.William Martin Leake, Northern Greece, vol. ii. pp. 26-29. The city is attested at least until the 6th century, when Procopius of Caesarea mentions it as part of Justinian I's efforts to fortify the nearby pass of Thermopylae. According to Procopius, a wall was erected across the valley of the Asopos, and the town was strengthened with an otherwise unidentified fortress called Myropoles. Traces of Byzantine fortifications, as well as a cistern, survive on the site. The town was apparently abandoned in the following decades. Some modern scholars have tried to identify it with the later medieval settlements of Ravennika or Siderokastron, but these identifications are generally rejected as incompatible with the literary evidence.

Heylin, The Act You've Known For All These Years: the Life, and Afterlife, of Sgt. Pepper (London: Canongate Books, 2007), , p. 85.) is a wide range of popular music styles and genres influenced by 1960s psychedelia, a subculture of people who used psychedelic drugs such as LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, mescaline and DMT to experience visual and auditory hallucinations, synesthesia and altered states of consciousness. Psychedelic music may also aim to enhance the experience of using these drugs. Psychedelic music emerged during the 1960s among folk and rock bands in the United States and the United Kingdom, creating the subgenres of psychedelic folk, psychedelic rock, acid rock, and psychedelic pop before declining in the early 1970s. Numerous spiritual successors followed in the ensuing decades, including progressive rock, krautrock, and heavy metal. Since the 1970s, revivals have included psychedelic funk, neo-psychedelia, and stoner rock as well as psychedelic electronic music genres such as acid house, trance music, and new rave.  Characteristics  \\"Psychedelic\\" as an adjective is often misused, with many acts playing in a variety of styles. Acknowledging this, author Michael Hicks explains: A number of features are quintessential to psychedelic music. Exotic instrumentation, with a particular fondness for the sitar and tabla are common.R. Rubin and J. P. Melnick, Immigration and American Popular Culture: an Introduction (New York, NY: New York University Press, 2007), , pp. 162–4. Songs often have more disjunctive song structures, key and time signature changes, modal melodies and drones than contemporary pop music. Surreal, whimsical, esoterically or literary- inspired lyrics are often used.G. Thompson, Please Please Me: Sixties British Pop, Inside Out (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), , p. 197.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop and Soul (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), , pp. 1322–3. There is often a strong emphasis on extended instrumental segments or jams.Hicks 2000, p.64-66 There is a strong keyboard presence, in the 1960s especially, using electronic organs, harpsichords, or the Mellotron, an early tape-driven 'sampler' keyboard.D. W. Marshall, Mass Market Medieval: Essays on the Middle Ages in Popular Culture (Jefferson NC: McFarland, 2007), , p. 32. Elaborate studio effects are often used, such as backwards tapes, panning the music from one side to another of the stereo track, using the \\"swooshing\\" sound of electronic phasing, long delay loops and extreme reverb.S. Borthwick and R. Moy, Popular Music Genres: an Introduction (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), , pp. 52–4. In the 1960s there was a use of electronic instruments such as early synthesizers and the theremin. Later forms of electronic psychedelia also employed repetitive computer-generated beats. 1960s: Original psychedelic era Timothy Leary, a major advocate of the use of LSD in the 1960s, photographed in 1989.

Worth, Illegal Drugs: Condone Or Incarcerate? (Marshall Cavendish, 2009), , p. 30. In the early 1960s the use of LSD and other psychedelics was advocated by new proponents of consciousness expansion such as Timothy Leary, Alan Watts, Aldous Huxley and Arthur Koestler,Anne Applebaum, \\"Did The Death Of Communism Take Koestler And Other Literary Figures With It?\\", The Huffington Post, 26 January 2010. and, according to Laurence Veysey, they profoundly influenced the thinking of the new generation of youth.L. R. Veysey, The Communal Experience: Anarchist and Mystical Communities in Twentieth-Century America (Chicago IL, University of Chicago Press, 1978), , p. 437. The psychedelic lifestyle had already developed in California, particularly in San Francisco, by the mid-1960s, with the first major underground LSD factory established by Owsley Stanley.J. DeRogatis, Turn On Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock (Milwaukie, Michigan: Hal Leonard, 2003), , pp. 8–9. From 1964 the Merry Pranksters, a loose group that developed around novelist Ken Kesey, sponsored the Acid Tests, a series of events involving the taking of LSD (supplied by Stanley), accompanied by light shows, film projection and discordant, improvised music by the Grateful Dead (financed by Stanley),https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/11/10/grateful-dead-at- center-of-bio-on-acid-king-owsley-stanley/ then known as the Warlocks, known as the psychedelic symphony.M. Hicks, Sixties Rock: Garage, Psychedelic, and Other Satisfactions Music in American Life (Chicago, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2000), , p. 60. The Pranksters helped popularise LSD use, through their road trips across America in a psychedelically-decorated converted school bus, which involved distributing the drug and meeting with major figures of the beat movement, and through publications about their activities such as Tom Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (1968).J. Mann, Turn on and Tune in: Psychedelics, Narcotics and Euphoriants (Royal Society of Chemistry, 2009), , p. 87. San Francisco had an emerging music scene of folk clubs, coffee houses and independent radio stations that catered to the population of students at nearby Berkeley and the free thinkers that had gravitated to the city.R. Unterberger, Eight Miles High: Folk-Rock's Flight from Haight-Ashbury to Woodstock (London: Backbeat Books, 2003), , pp. 11–13. There was already a culture of drug use among jazz and blues musicians, and in the early 1960s use of drugs including cannabis, peyote, mescaline and LSDT.

Shepherd, Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Media, Industry and Society (New York, NY: Continuum, 2003), , p. 211. One of the first musical uses of the term \\"psychedelic\\" in the folk scene was by the New York-based folk group The Holy Modal Rounders on their version of Lead Belly's 'Hesitation Blues' in 1964.M. Hicks, Sixties Rock: Garage, Psychedelic, and Other Satisfactions (University of Illinois Press, 2000), , pp 59–60. Folk/avant-garde guitarist John Fahey recorded several songs in the early 1960s experimented with unusual recording techniques, including backwards tapes, and novel instrumental accompaniment including flute and sitar. His nineteen-minute \\"The Great San Bernardino Birthday Party\\" \\"anticipated elements of psychedelia with its nervy improvisations and odd guitar tunings\\". Similarly, folk guitarist Sandy Bull's early work \\"incorporated elements of folk, jazz, and Indian and Arabic-influenced dronish modes\\". His 1963 album Fantasias for Guitar and Banjo explores various styles and \\"could also be accurately described as one of the very first psychedelic records\\". The Beatles filming a segment for their psychedelic song \\"I Am the Walrus\\" (1967) Soon musicians began to refer (at first indirectly, and later explicitly) to the drug and attempted to recreate or reflect the experience of taking LSD in their music, just as it was reflected in psychedelic art, literature and film.M. Campbell, Popular Music in America: And the Beat Goes on (Boston, MA: Cengage Learning, 3rd edn., 2008), , pp. 212–3. This trend ran in parallel in both America and Britain and as part of the interconnected folk and rock scenes.C. Grunenberg and J. Harris, Summer of Love: Psychedelic Art, Social Crisis and Counterculture in the 1960s (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2005), , p. 137. As pop music began incorporating psychedelic sounds, the genre emerged as a mainstream and commercial force.[ \\"Psychedelic pop\\"], Allmusic, retrieved 27 June 2010. Psychedelic rock reached its peak in the last years of the decade. From 1967 to 1968, it was the prevailing sound of rock music, either in the whimsical British variant, or the harder American West Coast acid rock. In America, the 1967 Summer of Love was prefaced by the Human Be-In event and reached its peak at the Monterey Pop Festival.W. E. Studwell and D. F. Lonergan, The Classic Rock and Roll Reader: Rock Music from its Beginnings to the mid-1970s (Abingdon: Routledge, 1999), , p. 223. These trends climaxed in the 1969 Woodstock festival, which saw performances by most of the major psychedelic acts, including Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Santana.A. Bennett, Remembering Woodstock (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2004), . By the end of the 1960s, the trend of exploring psychedelia in music was largely in retreat. LSD was declared illegal in the US and UK in 1966.I. Inglis, The Beatles, Popular Music and Society: a Thousand Voices (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2000), , p. 46. The linking of the murders of Sharon Tate and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca by The Manson Family to Beatles songs such as \\"Helter Skelter\\" contributed to an anti-hippie backlash.D. A. Nielsen, Horrible Workers: Max Stirner, Arthur Rimbaud, Robert Johnson, and the Charles Manson Circle: Studies in Moral Experience and Cultural Expression (Lanham MD: Lexington Books, 2005), , p. 84. The Altamont Free Concert in California, headlined by The Rolling Stones on December 6, 1969, did not turn out to be a positive milestone in the psychedelic music scene, as was anticipated; instead, it became notorious for the fatal stabbing of a black teenager Meredith Hunter by Hells Angels security guards.J. Wiener, Come Together: John Lennon in his Time (Chicago IL: University of Illinois Press, 1991), , pp. 124–6.  Revivals and successors  Rock and pop Progressive rock and hard rock By the end of the 1960s, many rock musicians had returned to the rootsy sources of rock and roll's origins, leading to what Barney Hoskyns called a \\"retrogressive, post-psychedelic music\\" development; he cited the country rock and blues/soul-inspired rock of the Rolling Stones, The Band, Delaney & Bonnie, Van Morrison, and Leon Russell. At the same time, a more avant-garde development came with the contingent of artists associated with Frank Zappa, including The Mothers of Invention, Captain Beefheart, Wild Man Fischer, The GTOs, and Alice Cooper. According to musicologist Frank Hoffman, post-psychedelic hard rock emerged from the varied rock scene, distinguished by more \\"cinematic guitar stylings and evocative lyric imagery\\", as in the music of Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Robin Trower. Music scholar Edward Macan notes that the \\"post-psychedelic hard rock/heavy metal styles\\" that emerged had \\"a weaker connection to the hippie ethos\\" and \\"strongly emphasized the blues progression\\". Psychedelic rock, with its distorted guitar sound, extended solos, and adventurous compositions, had been an important bridge between blues-oriented rock and the later emergence of metal. Two former guitarists with the Yardbirds, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page, moved on to form key acts in the new blues rock-heavy metal genre, The Jeff Beck Group and Led Zeppelin, respectively.B. A. Cook, Europe Since 1945: an Encyclopedia, Volume 2 (London: Taylor & Francis, 2001), , p. 1324. Other major pioneers of the heavy metal genre had begun as blues-based psychedelic bands, including Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Judas Priest and UFO.J. DeRogatis, Turn on Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock (Milwaukie, MI: Hal Leonard, 2003), , p. 212. According to American academic Christophe Den Tandt, many musicians during the post-psychedelic era adopted a stricter sense of professionalism and elements of classical music, as evinced by the concept albums of Pink Floyd and the virtuosic instrumentation of Emerson, Lake and Palmer. \\"Early-1970s post-psychedelic rock was hatched in small or medium-sized structures\\", he adds, naming record labels such as Virgin Records, Island Records, and Obscure Records. Many of the British musicians and bands that had embraced psychedelia moved into creating the progressive rock genre in the 1970s. King Crimson's album In the Court of the Crimson King (1969), has been seen as an important link between psychedelia and progressive rock.J. DeRogatis, Turn on Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock (Milwaukie, MI: Hal Leonard, 2003), , p. 169. While some bands such as Hawkwind maintained an explicitly psychedelic course into the 1970s, most bands dropped the psychedelic elements in favour of embarking on wider experimentation.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), , p. 515. As German bands from the psychedelic movement moved away from their psychedelic roots and placed increasing emphasis on electronic instrumentation, these groups, including Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, Can and Faust, developed a distinctive brand of electronic rock, known as kosmische musik, or in the British press as \\"Krautrock\\".P. Bussy, Kraftwerk: Man, Machine and Music (London: SAF, 3rd end., 2004), , pp. 15–17. Their adoption of electronic synthesisers, along with the musical styles explored by Brian Eno in his keyboard playing with Roxy Music, had a major influence on subsequent development of electronic rock.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), , pp. 1330–1. The incorporation of jazz styles into the music of bands like Soft Machine and Can, also contributed to the development of the emerging jazz rock sound of bands such as Colosseum.A. Blake, The Land Without Music: Music, Culture and Society in Twentieth-Century Britain (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1997), , pp. 154–5. Another development of the post- psychedelic era was more freedom with marketing of the artist and their records, such as with album artwork. Tandt identifies a recording artist's preference for anonymity in the economic market through the design of record sleeves having limited information about the musician or the record; he cites Pink Floyd's early 1970s albums, the Beatles' 1968 album (unofficially known as The White Album), and Led Zeppelin's 1971 album, for which \\"there is up to this day no consensus about the title\\". According to him, post-psychedelic musicians like Brian Eno and Robert Fripp \\"explicitly advocated\\" this disconnection between the artist and their work or stardom. \\"In so doing\\", he adds, \\"they laid the foundations for a central tendency of post-punk\\" in the late 1970s, as evinced by the first four albums by The Cure (featuring blurry photographs of the band members) and Factory Records' dark-colored covers with serial numbers. By the mid-1970s, post-psychedelic music's emphasis on musicianship had \\"laid itself bare to an iconoclastic rebellion\\", as Tandt described: \\"Mid-1970s punk rock, with its genuine or feigned ethos of musical crudeness, reinscribed rock's autonomy through cultural means opposite to those developed 10 years earlier.\\" Along with the psychedelic, folk rock, and British rhythm and blues styles that preceded it, the music of the post- psychedelic era later became associated with the classic rock category. Stoner rock, also known as stoner metal or stoner doom, is a rock music fusion genre that combines elements of heavy metal and/or doom metal with psychedelic rock and acid rock. The name references cannabis consumption. The term desert rock is often used interchangeably with the term \\"stoner rock\\" to describe this genre; however, not all stoner rock bands would fall under the descriptor of \\"desert rock\\". Stoner rock is typically slow-to-mid tempo and features a heavily distorted, groove-laden bass-heavy sound, melodic vocals, and \\"retro\\" production. The genre emerged during the early 1990s and was pioneered foremost by Monster Magnet and the California bands Fu Manchu, Kyuss and Sleep.Brief History of Stoner Rock and Stoner MetalArticles @ Ultimate- Guitar.Com Post-punk, indie rock and alternative rock Neo-psychedelia (or \\"acid punk\\") is a diverse style of music that originated in the 1970s as an outgrowth of the British post-punk scene. Its practitioners drew from the unusual sounds of 1960s psychedelic music, either updating or copying the approaches from that era. Neo-psychedelia may include forays into psychedelic pop, jangly guitar rock, heavily distorted free-form jams, or recording experiments. Some of the scene's bands, including the Soft Boys, the Teardrop Explodes, and Echo & the Bunnymen, became major figures of neo-psychedelia. The early 1980s Paisley Underground movement followed neo-psychedelia. Originating in Los Angeles, the movement saw a number of young bands who were influenced by the psychedelia of the late 1960s and all took different elements of it. The term \\"Paisley Underground\\" was later expanded to include others from outside the city. The Stone Roses in concert in Milan in 2012. Madchester was a music and cultural scene that developed in the Manchester area of North West England in the late 1980s, in which artists merged alternative rock with acid house and dance culture as well as other sources, including psychedelic music and 1960s pop.Echard, William (2017). Psychedelic Popular Music: A History through Musical Topic Theory. Indiana University Press. pp. 244–246 The label was popularised by the British music press in the early 1990s, and its most famous groups include the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, the Charlatans and 808 State. The rave-influenced scene is widely seen as heavily influenced by drugs, especially ecstasy (MDMA). At that time, the Haçienda nightclub, co-owned by members of New Order, was a major catalyst for the distinctive musical ethos in the city that was called the Second Summer of Love. Screamadelica is the third studio album by Scottish rock band Primal Scream released on 1991. The album marked a significant departure from the band's early indie rock sound, drawing inspiration from the blossoming house music scene and associated drugs such as LSD and MDMA. It won the first Mercury Music Prize in 1992, and has sold over three million copies worldwide. AllMusic states: \\"Aside from the early-'80s Paisley Underground movement and the Elephant 6 collective of the late 1990s, most subsequent neo-psychedelia came from isolated eccentrics and revivalists, not cohesive scenes.\\" They go on to cite what they consider some of the more prominent artists: the Church, Nick Saloman's Bevis Frond, Spacemen 3, Robyn Hitchcock, Mercury Rev, the Flaming Lips, and Super Furry Animals. According to Treblezines Jeff Telrich: \\"Primal Scream made [neo-psychedelia] dancefloor ready. The Flaming Lips and Spiritualized took it to orchestral realms. And Animal Collective—well, they kinda did their own thing.\\" Hypnagogic pop, chillwave, and glo-fi The Atlantic writer Llewellyn Hinkes Jones identified a variety of music styles from the 2000s characterized by mellow beats, vintage synthesizers, and lo-fi melodies, including chillwave, glo-fi, and hypnagogic pop. These three terms were described as interchangeable by the Quietus, along with other terms \\"dream-beat\\" and \\"hipster-gogic pop.\\" Altogether, they may be viewed as a type of synth-based psychedelic music. The term \\"chillwave\\" was coined in July 2009 on the Hipster Runoff blog by Carles (the pseudonym used by the blog's author) on his accompanying \\"blog radio\\" show of the same name. Carles invented the genre name for a host of similarly sounding up-and-coming bands. In August 2009, \\"hypnagogic pop\\" was coined by journalist David Keenan to refer to a developing trend of 2000s lo-fi and post-noise music in which artists from varied backgrounds began to engage with elements of cultural nostalgia, childhood memory, and outdated recording technology. By 2010, albums by Ariel Pink and Neon Indian were regularly hailed by publications like Pitchfork and The Wire. The terms \\"hypnagogic pop\\", \\"chillwave\\", and \\"glo-fi\\" were soon adopted to describe the evolving sound of such artists, a number of which had songs of considerable success within independent music circles. Originally, it was common for the three terms to be used interchangeably, but chillwave later distinguished itself as a combination of dream pop, new age, muzak, and synth-pop. A 2009 review by Pitchforks Marc Hogan for Neon Indian's album Psychic Chasms referenced \\"dream-beat\\", \\"chillwave\\", \\"glo-fi\\", \\"hypnagogic pop\\", and \\"hipster-gogic pop\\" as interchangeable terms for \\"psychedelic music that's generally one or all of the following: synth-based, homemade-sounding, 80s-referencing, cassette- oriented, sun-baked, laid-back, warped, hazy, emotionally distant, slightly out of focus.\\" Funk, soul, and hip hop Following the late 1960s work of Jimi Hendrix, psychedelia began to have a widespread impact on African American musicians.\\"Psychedelic soul\\", Allmusic, retrieved 27 February 2017. Black funk artists such as Sly and the Family Stone borrowed techniques from psychedelic rock music, including wah pedals, fuzz boxes, echo chambers, and vocal distorters, as well as elements of blues rock and jazz. In the following years, groups such as Parliament-Funkadelic continued this sensibility, employing synthesizers and rock-oriented guitar work into open-ended funk jams. Producer Norman Whitfield would draw on this sound on popular Motown recordings such as the Temptations' \\"Cloud Nine\\" (1968) and Marvin Gaye's \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" (1969). Influenced by the civil rights movement, psychedelic soul had a darker and more political edge than much psychedelic rock. Building on the funk sound of James Brown, it was pioneered by Sly and the Family Stone with songs like \\"Dance to the Music\\" (1968), \\"Everyday People\\" (1968) and \\"I Want to Take You Higher\\" (1969) and The Temptations with \\"Cloud Nine\\", \\"Runaway Child, Running Wild\\" (1969) and \\"Psychedelic Shack\\" (1969).G.

Electronic  House, techno, and trance  The rave scene emphasized house, acid house and techno. The rave genre \\"hardcore\\" first appeared amongst the UK acid movement during the late 1980s at warehouse parties and other underground venues, as well as on UK pirate radio stations.AllMusic The genre would develop into oldschool hardcore, which led to newer forms of rave music such as drum and bass and 2-step, as well as other hardcore techno genres, such as gabber, hardstyle and happy hardcore. In the late 1980s, rave culture began to filter through from English expatriates and disc jockeys who would visit Continental Europe. American raves began in the 1990s in New York City. A Roland TB-303 Bassline sequencer Acid house originated in the mid-1980s in the house music style of Chicago DJs like DJ Pierre, Adonis, Farley Jackmaster Funk and Phuture, the last of which coined the term on his \\"Acid Trax\\" (1987). It mixed elements of house with the \\"squelchy\\" sounds and deep basslines produced by the Roland TB-303 synthesizer. As singles began to reach the UK the sound was re-created, beginning in small warehouse parties held in London in 1986–87. During 1988 in the Second Summer of Love it hit the mainstream as thousands of clubgoers travelled to mass raves. The genre then began to penetrate the British pop charts with hits for M/A/R/R/S, S'Express, and Technotronic by the early 1990s, before giving way to the popularity of trance music.[ \\"Acid house\\"], Allmusic, retrieved 27 June 2010. Trance music originated in the German techno and hardcore scenes of the early 1990s. It emphasized brief and repeated synthesizer lines with minimal rhythmic changes and occasional synthesizer atmospherics, with the aim of putting listeners into a trance-like state. A writer for Billboard magazine writes, “Trance music is perhaps best described as a mixture of 70s disco and 60s psychedelia”. Derived from acid house and techno music, it developed in Germany and the Netherlands with singles including \\"Energy Flash\\" by Joey Beltram and \\"The Ravesignal\\" by CJ Bolland. This was followed by releases by Robert Leiner, Sun Electric, Aphex Twin and most influentially the techno- trance released by the Harthouse label, including the much emulated \\"Acperience 1\\" (1992) by duo Hardfloor. Having gained some popularity in the UK in the early 1990s it was eclipsed by the appearance of new genres of electronic music such as trip hop and jungle, before taking off again towards the end of the decade and beginning to dominate the clubs. It soon began to fragment into a number of subgenres, including progressive trance, acid trance, goa trance, psychedelic trance, hard trance and uplifting trance.[ \\"Trance\\"], Allmusic, retrieved 27 June 2010. In the 2010s, artists such as Bassnectar, Tipper and Pretty Lights dominated the more mainstream psychedelic cultures. \\"Raves\\" became much larger and grew to mainstream appeal.  New rave  New rave band the Klaxons in concert in 2007 In Britain in the 2000s (decade), the combination of indie rock with dance-punk was dubbed \\"new rave\\" in publicity for Klaxons, and the term was picked up and applied by the NME to a number of bands.K.

Bruner's music combined elements of traditional string band music, improvisation, blues, folk, and popular melodies of the times.All Music Guide to Country — The Experts' Guide to the Best Recordings in Country Music, edited by Michael Erlewine, Vladimir Bogdanov, Chris Woodstra, & Stephen Thomas Erlewine, San Francisco: Miller Freeman Books, 1997 The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Third edition, eight volumes, edited by Colin Larkin, London: Muze, 1998 The Harmony Illustrated Encyclopedia of Country Music by Fred Dellar, Allan Cackett, & Roy Thompson, New York: Harmony Books, 1987 (biography contains portrait) The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Country Music, by Fred Dellar, Roy Thompson, & Douglas B. Green, New York: Harmony Books, 1977 (biography contains portrait); Biography Bruner was born in Texas City, Texas, and spent most of his childhood near Houston. He learned to play fiddle, and traveled with medicine shows to begin his musical career. Milton Brown's Musical Brownies drafted Bruner in 1935. Bruner played with the ensemble's classically trained fiddler Cecil Brower to create the memorable double fiddle sound of Milton Brown's group. Bruner recorded with Brown's group on the Decca music label, until Brown was killed in an automobile accident in 1936. This ended Bruner's involvement in the group. That same year (1936), Bruner moved to Houston and formed The Texas Wanderers, a band that included Lee Bell (de) on electric guitar, Bob Dunn on electric steel guitar, Leo Raley on mandolin, J. R. Chatwell on fiddle, Dickie McBride on guitar and vocals, and Moon Mullican on vocals and piano. The Wanderers recorded on the Decca and Mercury Records labels. His songs had a special southern characteristic including songs about truck driving, lost love, the draft, and ill repute. Cliff Bruner is an unsung star of the little-noted Country music charts that appeared in Billboard prior to 1944. His hit \\"It Makes No Difference Now\\" spent twenty weeks atop the chart. Other hits in 1939–1942 included \\"Sorry,\\" \\"Kelly Swing\\", \\"I'll Keep On Loving You\\", and \\"When You're Smiling\\". Perhaps his most famous hit was \\"Truck Drivers' Blues,\\" the first truck driving song. Many of these recordings featured future singer piano star, Moon Mullican, on vocals. Bruner's big band disbanded in the 1950s, however, he continued to play music, and his trio appeared in the 1984 Sally Field movie Places in the Heart.

Her husband was Xiao Zhaoye, who is commonly known by his posthumously demoted title of Prince of Yulin.Women Shall Not Rule: Imperial Wives and Concubines in China from Han to Liao By Keith McMahon page 157 Life He Jingying's father He Ji (何戢) was a high-level official during the reigns of Xiao Zhaoye's great-grandfather Emperor Gao and grandfather Emperor Wu of Southern Qi. Her mother Lady Song was He Ji's concubine. He Ji's wife Liu Chuyu the Princess Kuaiji was the daughter of Emperor Xiaowu of Liu Song; later, because He Jingying was adulterous, just as Liu Chuyu was, some historians erroneously reported Liu Chuyu as He Jingying's birth mother, but that was not true. Crown Princess In 484, when Xiao Zhaoye's father Xiao Zhangmao the Crown Prince was considering whom to take as a wife for his oldest son Xiao Zhaoye, he considered a number of daughters of nobles, and initially he rejected He Jingying on account of He Ji was sonless and therefore did not have a strong household. The prime minister Wang Jian pointed out that since Xiao Zhaoye would be in line to inherit the throne in the future, he only needed a wife of noble birth, not necessarily one with a strong clan. Xiao Zhangmao agreed and took He Jingying as Xiao Zhaoye's wife. As Xiao Zhaoye carried the title of Prince of Nan Commandery, He Jingying received the title of Princess of Nan Commandery. He Jingying was known for her adulterous activities, as she had on affairs with others while she was princess. The most known affair she carried out was with Xiao Zhaoye's attendant Yang Min (楊珉): it was said that they spent day and night together, just like husband and wife. However, He Jingying was also very loving in her relationship with Xiao Zhaoye and they had a happy marriage, and so Xiao Zhaoye turned a blind eye to the affair. Some historians indicate that there could have also been a sexual relationship between Xiao Zhaoye and Yang Min, suggesting a ménage à trois. In 493, after Crown Prince Zhangmao died, Xiao Zhaoye became crown prince; Princess He became crown princess. Outwardly, he mourned his father's death and was worried about his grandfather Emperor Wu's health, as Emperor Wu was also in ill health at the time, but when he wrote to the Crown Princess, he wrote one large character of Xi (喜, meaning \\"happiness\\") surrounded by 36 smaller Xi characters. Empress Later that year, Emperor Wu died. Xiao Zhaoye succeeded him as emperor, and he created Crown Princess He empress. He took her family members into the palace and set up quarters for them in Yaoling Palace (耀靈殿) - a major breach of protocol at the time. As empress, Empress He continued her affair with Yang Min. In early 494, Xiao Zhaoye's granduncle, the prime minister Xiao Luan sent the trusted general Xiao Tanzhi (蕭坦之) to advise Xiao Zhaoye to execute Yang Min, and initially, Xiao Zhaoye refused, and Empress He tearfully pleaded for Yang's life. Xiao Tanzhi, however, pointed out how the news of the affair between Empress He and Yang had become widespread. Xiao Zhaoye was forced to agree, and he issued an edict for Yang's execution. When he subsequently tried to withdraw the verdict after Xiao Tanzhi left, it was too late; Yang had been executed. In fall 494, with Xiao Zhaoye despising Xiao Luan for his constant curbing of his activity, Xiao Luan became apprehensive, and he assassinated the young emperor, posthumously demoting him to the title of Prince of Yulin.

According to a 14th-century Tendai source, he helped to determine boundaries by drawing the shape of the country as a one-‐pointed vajraMax Moerman, Demonology and Eroticism: Islands of Women in the Japanese Buddhist Imagination. (Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture, 2009) 357. (the vajra is a symbol for both a thunderbolt and a diamond). Gyōki is also often considered Japan’s first civil engineer, as he literally paved the way for infrastructure and the creation of places of worship. .\\"Sellers, Erica. GYOGI-TYPE MAPS THE HISTORY AND SIGNIFICANCE OF JAPANESE CARTROGRAPHY IN RELATION TO CONTEMPORARY MAPPING SYSTEMS. \\"Even though no proof exists that Gyogi ever made a map himself, the term 'Gyogi type maps' has come to be applied to early provincial maps he inspired. ... Their most notable feature ... was the way in which they depicted the provinces in balloon shapes (round or oval) clustered around Kyoto, the capital. The main purpose of Gyogi-type maps seems to have been to show the relationships of the provinces with one another and the capital.\\"Waters, John K. 1999. \\"Ten Thousand Rare and Valuable things.\\" Mercator's World. Volume 4 (1) January/February 1999. Pages 16-17. \\"A scheme of outline loops showing land ownership and boundaries, with South generally at the top, characterized this form of map-making, a response to the government's need for feudal information. Examples of such estate surveys surviving from the Nara period in the eighth century (named after the ancient Japanese capital city). They are legible and informative, but unrelated to other aspects of accuracy. Although none of Gyogi's own maps survive today, cadastral maps in his style still exist in the Shosoin, an imperial archive from that time, and are shown occasionally in the city of Nara. The Gyogi style represented loyalty to a valid tradition. These schematic loops of information, rather than realistic shapes, continued well into the nineteenth century, as did the complex Buddhist world maps, which were also unrelated to knowledge of the world's shapes of land and sea, but rather, maps of a spiritual landscape.\\"Franklin, Colin. 1997. \\"A Western View of Japanese Mapmaking.\\" Mercator's World. Volume 2 (1). January/February 1997. . Pages 29-30. During the construction of Tōdai-ji, the major temple in Nara, the government recruited Gyōki and his fellow ubasoku monks to organize labor and resources from the countryside. He also oversaw the creation of several ponds around the temple. He died on February 2, 749, at the age of 80, and was buried at Chikurin-ji, a temple now in Ikoma, Nara. The Imperial Court in Kyoto posthumously granted him the title of Bosatsu in 751, so in Japan he is often referred to as Gyōki Bosatsu.

Japanese-built VIP style Toyota Crown Majesta at the 2016 Osaka Auto Messe. American-built VIP style Lexus GS alt= VIP style () is a car modification trend that translates from the Romanised Japanese term 'bippu.' It refers to the modification of Japanese luxury automobiles to make them lower and wider in stance, with more aggressive wheels, suspension, and body kits. VIP Style cars are typically large, expensive, rear-wheel drive sedans, although automotive enthusiasts sometimes use other cars such as minivans and kei cars. VIP cars were once associated with the Yakuza; however, VIP style modifications are now a subset of their own as automotive modifications. As a trend, it differentiates itself from the traditional origins of the term VIP otherwise associated with the concept of a \\"very important person\\". The VIP style has become a loose appropriation of the term perpetuated amongst enthusiasts that goes beyond traditional VIP cars. History VIP modifications and their history have often been linked to the Yakuza. By using JDM cars with modifications associated with limousines, gangsters could avoid detection by the police and rival gangs.Scott Tsuneishi, Keepin' it Gangsta Homie-san, Import Tuner, December 2006 (#93). Both Osaka street racers and Kanto-area bōsōzoku gangs adopted styles in different ways. Osaka street racers, after suffering numerous police crackdowns on the Hanshin Expressway in the early 1990s, turned to sedans, after police targeted sport compacts, as a way to cruise while remaining incognito. The bōsōzoku in Kanto took a somewhat different approach by modifying sedans with cut coils and mufflers. The resulting cars were often bold and loud and known as \\"Yankee Style\\". Their styling cues were actually taken from Super Silhouette race cars of the 1970s and 1980s. They also drove recklessly, such as causing traffic jams and avoiding paying tolls. To mimic their Yakuza counterparts, they used large black sedans.  Characteristics  Cars associated with VIP style modifications usually have common characteristics, such as flashy \\"deep dish\\" wheels with low offsets that sit flush with the fenders, exhausts that stick out past the rear bumper, a body kit, glossy paint, and a lowered ride height. It is not uncommon to see significant negative camber on many VIP style cars. Traditional VIP style colours are usually black, white, grey and silver. The appearance of these vehicles is regarded in Japan as conspicuous and attention-seeking, as owning this type of vehicle is expensive with regards to Japan's annual road taxes. Cars used The majority of VIP cars are Japanese Luxury sedans from major Japanese corporations such as Nissan Cedric/Gloria/Fuga, Cima/President, Leopard/Laurel, Nissan Cefiro from Nissan, the Toyota Aristo, Celsior, Century, Crown Majesta, Toyota Windom Mark X and Crown from Toyota, the Mitsubishi Proudia/Dignity, Diamante/Magna from Mitsubishi, the Mazda Sentia/929/Luce, Millenia, MS-8 from Mazda and the Honda Legend, Vigor/Inspire from Honda. As automotive enthusiasts began to put their own spin on VIP, everything from minivans like the Toyota Estima and Honda Odyssey, to smaller cars like the Suzuki Cappucino and Toyota bB, have received similar modifications. United States enthusiasts use USDM Japanese sedans, such as the Lexus GS, Lexus LS, Infiniti Q45, Infiniti M45, and Acura RL. Motorsport and aftermarket firm Impul is also well known for building kits for owners of VIP-style cars. Junction Produce is also one of the most popular producers of VIP style parts, and their accessories are most commonly used in VIP-type builds.

The weapons were intended to be used by engineers to clear obstacles including bunkers and barbed wire, that longer range artillery would not be able to target accurately. Development The Germans studied the Siege of Port Arthur, where heavy artillery had been unable to destroy defensive structures like barbed wire and bunkers. The German Military Ingenieurkomitee (\\"Engineer committee\\") began working with Rheinmetall to study the problem in 1907. The solution they developed was a short-barrelled rifled muzzle-loading mortar, built in three sizes. In 1910, the largest of these was introduced as the 25 cm schwerer Minenwerfer (abbreviated \\"sMW\\"; English: \\"25 cm heavy mine launcher\\"). Despite weighing only 955 kg (2,193 pounds), it had the same effect on targets as the 28 cm and 30.5 cm mortars, which weighed ten times as much. At the outbreak of the First World War, 44 had been delivered. They were used successfully in Belgium at Liege and Namur, and against the French fortress of Maubeuge. The medium version, the 17 cm mittlerer Minenwerfer (mMW; \\"17cm mid-sized mine launcher\\"), was introduced in 1913. At the outbreak of the war one year later, 116 were fielded. The light version of the weapon, the 7.58 cm leichter Minenwerfer (LMW; \\"light mine launcher\\"), was still at the prototype stage when the war started, but rapidly entered production. The weapon was far more efficient than its artillery counterpart: in comparison, the 7.7 cm FK 96 n/A needed to be towed by a team of six horses, compared with a single horse for the LMW; additionally, the LMW could be moved around the battlefield by four men. The minenwerfer was cheaper, costing only one seventh as much as the artillery gun, as did its ammunition. Since the muzzle velocity, and thus firing shock, of minenwerfers was low, a variety of explosives that would usually be unsuitable for use in artillery was used to fill the shells. In any case, TNT explosive was reserved for use in artillery shells. Typically, the explosives used in minenwerfer shells were ammonium nitrate-carbon explosives. However, the sensitivity of the explosives occasionally made them detonate in the tube. There were a large number of these incidents, one of which claimed the life of Karl Völler, head designer of Rheinmetall, in 1916. These problems, however, were eventually overcome. Recognizing the numerous advantages of the minenwerfer in trench warfare, production was stepped up and, by 1918, the numbers had increased dramatically to 1,234 heavy, 2,361 medium and 12,329 light minenwerfer. A 38 cm calibre sehr schwerer Minenwerfer (ssMW; English: \\"very heavy mine launcher\\") was also developed.

The events are attended by fathers and their teenage daughters in order to promote virginity until marriage. Typically, daughters who attend a purity ball make a virginity pledge to remain sexually abstinent until marriage. Fathers who attend a purity ball make a promise to protect their young daughters' \\"purity of mind, body, and soul.\\" Proponents of these events believe that they encourage close and deeply affectionate relationships between fathers and daughters, thereby avoiding the premarital sexual activity that allegedly results when young women seek love through relationships with young men. The practice has faced criticism from women's organizations.  Origins  In 1998, the first purity ball was organized by Randy and Lisa Wilson in Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States of America. This event was created for the Wilsons' five daughters and the fathers that he viewed as not having a place in their daughters' lives.  Ceremony  The ceremony is a formal event as daughters get dressed up in ball gowns, and the evening typically consists of dinner, a keynote speaker, ballroom dancing and a vow for fathers and daughters. The girls can range in age from their college years to four years old; however, the majority of girls are “just old enough… [to] have begun menstruating” as purity ball guidelines advise. Some ceremonies state a minimum age requirement. Although the chastity pledges differ between organizations, the purity balls held by the creator of the concept, Pastor Randy Wilson, follow a symbolic ritual. Each father or mentor pledges to shield and protect his daughter; to live a pure life himself as a man, husband, and father; and, to be a man of integrity and responsibility as he acts as a role model for his family. The father's protecting role over the daughter's virginity is emphasized throughout the night, as Wilson states “Fathers, our daughters are waiting for us… They are desperately waiting for us in a culture that lures them into the murky waters of exploitation. They need to be rescued by you, their dad.” One widely used pledge for fathers reads: “I, (daughter’s name)’s father, choose before God to cover my daughter as her authority and protection in the area of purity. I will be pure in my own life as a man, husband and father. I will be a man of integrity and accountability as I lead, guide and pray over my daughter and my family as the high priest in my home. This covering will be used by God to influence generations to come.” Remembrance gifts are given at some ceremonies to represent the girl's promise of chastity and the father's oath to protect her and guide her in her lifestyle. One form of token is a charm bracelet or necklace in the shape of a heart for the girl and a key for her father, which symbolizes the father's duty to protect the young girl's heart, only giving away the key to her husband on her wedding day. The ceremonies close with a father-daughter waltz which aims to solidify the bond between father and daughter and elucidate the promoters' concept of a \\"proper date\\". Lisa Wilson, wife to Randy Wilson and co-founder of Generations of Light, a popular Christian ministry in Colorado Springs, states “We wanted to set a standard of dignity and honor for the way the girls should be treated by the men in their lives”. Wilson advises fathers to praise their daughters' physical attractiveness: \\"I applaud your courage to look your daughter in the eye and tell her how beautiful she is.\\" Participants are described as \\"dates\\", and, according to Glamour magazine, could be mistaken for heterosexual romantic partners in the absence of information about their parent-child relationship.  Beliefs and rationale  Advocates of purity balls assert that they promote physical, psychological, and spiritual integrity. Randy Wilson, one of the co- founders of the purity ball, states that \\"The idea was to model what the relationship can be as a daughter grows from a child to an adult. You come in closer, become available to answer whatever questions she has.\\" Wilson did not want virginity pledges to become characteristic elements of purity balls as he questions the wisdom of such promises: \\"It heaps guilt upon them. If they fail, you've made it worse for them.\\" In an interview with Anderson Cooper, Wilson said that purity balls encourage fathers to participate in their daughters' lives, provide guidance, and teach coping skills.  Criticism  Writer and feminist Eve Ensler criticizes purity balls for implying that fathers, rather than young women themselves, have the freedom to control whether and with whom the young women engage in sexual intercourse.Would you pledge your virginity to your father? ; Glamour; January, 2007; Jennifer Baumgardner. Glamour claims that National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health data supports the conclusion that teenagers making virginity pledges, including those promulgated through purity balls, usually do not adhere to the required standard of chastity, and are less prepared to utilize safe sex practices to mitigate the risks when engaging in sexual activity. Furthermore, Glamour states that the percentage of teenagers in a given area who have made virginity pledges is positively correlated with the frequency with which sexually transmitted infections occur. An article in Time magazine says that there is a scientific controversy as to the efficacy of the virginity pledges at purity balls.The Pursuit of Teen Girl Purity ; Time Magazine; July 17, 2008; Nancy Gibbs Opponents of purity balls claim that they encroach upon women's freedom of choice to date whom they please and to make their own independent decisions without the help of men. In this view, the philosophy of purity balls implies that young girls are not capable of making their own choices. Jennifer Freitag, a Southern Illinois University Carbondale doctoral student, argues that, from a feminist perspective, the purity ball ritual can be considered sexist discrimination as it rarely applies to men, and ignores whether women desire heterosexual marriages. Freitag further asserts that the purity balls and virginity pledges give women fewer opportunities to explore their future mates and presume that the girls will marry men, ignoring lesbianism, bisexuality, and transsexualism. Also, Freitag claims that purity balls have psychological elements of father-daughter incest. Conservative journalist Betsy Hart supports the idea of sexual abstinence prior to marriage. However, she has expressed concerns that purity balls are pervaded by a preoccupation with physical chastity which may inadvertently imbue the social construction of girls attending them with erotic attributes. She claims that this \\"sexualizing\\" shifts attention away from maintenance of the internal moral and spiritual virtue which she believes is required by the tenets of the Christian faith.

History The original Papaya King was opened in 1932 on the corner of 86th St. and Third Ave. on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Although the restaurant originally only served drinks made from fresh tropical fruits, it soon expanded to serving hot dogs due to the influence of its neighborhood, which at the time was populated predominantly by German-American immigrants. It now also serves crispy curly fries, onion rings, fried pickles, fried Oreos, fried Twinkies, tater tots, knishes, cheese steaks and corn dogs. Papaya King was founded and run for many years by the late Constantine \\"Gus\\" Poulos, and later by his son Peter, who first managed their second store (with seating) at 87th Street and Third Avenue. In the 1930s, there was also a store in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania. During the 1970s, the Pouloses attempted to franchise the restaurant, and one franchise briefly opened in midtown. A company-owned store opened (and closed) in the 1980s at 59th Street and Third Avenue. In 2001, another company-owned store opened in Philadelphia, this time on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania at 40th and Locust Streets; it closed in 2004. In 2006, another attempted franchise opened briefly in the food court at Roosevelt Field Mall on Long Island, in Garden City, New York. The Poulos family sold the business in the early 2000s. Expansion Papaya King opened a restaurant at 1645 Wilcox Ave. in Hollywood (Los Angeles) California in 2011, but it had closed by the beginning of 2013. In May 2013, Papaya King opened a concept store on St. Marks Place, a historical and cultural crossroads in New York City’s East Village neighborhood. The store featured a recessed patio area in front, widely referred to as “the stoop,” where customers and locals gathered. The store featured many of the classic elements that characterize the 86th Street location, with additional experiences such as vintage arcade games, a projector screen, a sound system, and branded merchandise. This location closed in November 2017 when the building was sold to a real estate developer. During the summer of 2014, Papaya King opened its first food truck that is parked throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn. In May 2016, Papaya King expanded to Brooklyn and opened their third restaurant on the corner of Nevins Street and Flatbush Avenue in Downtown Brooklyn. This location mirrors the look of the original location in the Upper East Side. In 2016, Papaya King started franchising with two locations in Las Vegas. The first opened on November 14, 2016 across from the Hard Rock Hotel, and a second 24-hour location opened at the Hawaiian Marketplace in March 2017. The Las Vegas locations were much larger than the counter-service-only restaurants in New York, and had full liquor licenses and waiter service.

Jungle Habitat, which was in West Milford, in Passaic County, New Jersey, United States, was a Warner Bros.-owned theme park that opened in the summer of 1972, and closed in October 1976. By November 1972, the park had 500,000 paid visitors. The park contained over 1,500 animals; it consisted of a drive-through section and a walk-through section. The drive-through section was an animal safari park and the walk-through area was called Jungle Junction. History The park featured a drive-through safari section, which allowed for wild animals to roam free and approach vehicles as they slowly drove through. Drivers and their passenger(s) could observe peacocks, baboons, camels, elephants, llamas, giraffes, and Siberian tigers in this section, either in their cars or on a Jungle Habitat bus. Many of the animals would climb atop the cars, and/or walk in front of vehicles, bringing them to a halt. Signs were posted along the route to warn visitors to keep their windows closed. Great Adventure in Jackson Township, New Jersey, approximately to the south, also had (until recently) a similar type of drive-through safari attraction (theirs has now been converted to a ride-through attraction as part of the amusement park, so it is still viewed by vehicle but not by car). The walk-through section was a small theme park which included a petting zoo, camel and elephant rides, snack bars, gift shop, a reptile house, a dolphin show, and \\"Bugs Bunny and Friends\\" live shows including Warner Bros. Looney Tunes characters, including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Yosemite Sam, Tweety Bird, Sylvester the Cat, Speedy Gonzales, Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. Guests could have their photographs taken with the characters. The shows occurred three times a day on weekdays, and four on weekends. A small tram station here was called Jungle Junction. The park did not have amusement- style rides, although there were plans (which never materialized) to add them in the spring of 1977. Plans The park was initially profitable. However, business declined gradually as it failed to attract repeat business without changing its attractions or adding new ones. In 1975, Warner Bros. proposed a $20 million expansion project to the site. The project would include a large wooden roller coaster, a steel junior coaster, a carousel, log flume, plus adult spinning rides, and a few \\"kiddie\\" rides. The township's residents were divided on whether or not to approve such a project. The potential for further traffic congestion was a major issue. Closure and current status The park opened as usual during the summer of 1976, with rumors of a big expansion planned for the following summer. The park's last weekend in operation was Halloween weekend. On November 2, township residents narrowly voted against the expansion. Following the vote, Warner Bros. decided to shut the park down and sell the land. After the park closed, newspapers reported that several animal carcasses, including an elephant, had been left there to decay. Competition from Great Adventure, combined with poor management and the park's inability to easily expand, may have contributed to the demise of Jungle Habitat. For years after it closed, the site's deteriorated buildings remained, and rumors of animals still roaming the property attracted curiosity seekers. Accounts of such explorations were published in Weird NJ magazine, and on its website. None of the animal-based rumors are true; the animals were sold to buyers across the country. The Jungle Habitat property, containing of paved roads, was purchased by the state in 1988 for $1.45 million. The property, adjacent to Norvin Green State Forest and Greenwood Lake Airport, is part of Long Pond Ironworks State Park and is administered by Ringwood State Park. In 2007, under the direction of Ringwood State Park, the Ramapo Valley Cycling Club (a chapter of the Jersey Off Road Bicycle Association JORBA) performed a cleanup of the park, with 70 volunteers contributing. Brush was cleared and trash was removed. More recently, under the management of Ringwood State Park, JORBA built single-track trails designed for bicycle, equestrian, and foot traffic. There were 11 to 12 miles of single-track trails by 2008. There was negotiation between West Milford and New Jersey to lease the macadam parking lot for recreational use. In recent years, the property was used to host West Milford's Fourth of July celebrations (known as \\"Thunder in the Highlands\\") under a special-use permit. A local bicycle shop sponsors \\"Rumble in the Jungle\\", an annual mountain bike race.Rumble in the Jungle bike race, sponsored by Town Cycle. The area has become popular with dog walkers, mountain bikers, trail runners, equestrians, and American black bears. Conservation efforts As a zoological park, Warner Bros. Jungle Habitat was engaged in conservation efforts involving its species. The park was equipped with a state of the art hospital, nursery and had a full veterinary staff on site. Since the park's opening in 1972, the Siberian tiger streak produced three tiger cubs, with births in May and June 1974. The births excited the park \\"because Siberian tigers were an endangered species and births in captivity were unusual.\\" Former attractions * Safari Car Ride - The main attraction of Warner Bros.

History The history of the town begins in 1886 when Ali bin Said, an Islamic scholar from Parit Sakai, was appointed Orang Kaya (noble lord) officer by Sultan Abu Bakar of Johor. Ali was sent by his father, Orang Kaya Said, the first Muar District headman (penghulu) appointed by Temenggong Ibrahim, to Mecca upon the completion of his religious study in Malacca at the age of 15. At that time, the resident of \\"Padang\\" area which also included the area of Parit Sakai up to Parit Samsu; with its administration centre in Parit Bakar, is said to have a common ('wakaf') house in Mecca in the \\"Village of Shuib Ali\\" in the 19th century. The house was to put the children of officers and dignitaries of Padang acquiring religious knowledge and studies upon the end of their study in Malacca. It was the wish of many peoples in Padang to send their children to further their study of religion in Mecca or Egypt so that they can become a pious and religious scholar. Some parents even accompanied their son during their study and stay until they died in the Holy Land in those days. According to an account, Orang Kaya Ali returned to Padang after his father Orang Kaya Said died in Mecca. He then demanded that the position the headman of Muar that was temporary given and being held by his cousin named Omar Junid acting in that position, during a time in the absence of the late Omar. However the request was rejected by Sultan Ali of Johor because his age is still young and unsuitable to hold the position of the headman, a position as the royal government officer and the Muar representative of the Sultan. To find solutions, Sultan Ali appointed him as a minister but the appointment failed to satisfy Ali and his followers because the position does not give any meaning in the administration in the region of Muar. Thus, disputes arose between the Ali's followers and Omar's supporters causing the two groups to fight and raise the flag of their group, red for Ali and white for Omar that continued for several months and forced the Sultan to come to Muar to handle and settle the situation between the followers of the two groups. To avoid bloodshed, the Sultan gave approval to the followers of Ali to open a new area in the southern part of Muar to enable Ali to be appointed headman. Orang Kaya Ali retreated to the south coast in the Malacca Strait riding a big boat weighing about one ton bringing together adequate ration of food for 30 days and 16 followers to find new areas suitable opening a villages. After landing in an area about 30 km from Muar, followers of Ali opened a village and planted various trees and crops like durian, 'talas' and paddy . Eventually the new villages were developed and became prospererous and famous across Muar. Ali along with his followers sailed along the coast of the Malacca Strait which was infested with a lot of pirates to the harvested crop to the sultan. The name \\"Sungai Balang\\" was immortalized for the village as the bravery and successes of Orang Kaya Ali and his followers opening the new areas and sailing along the coast to present the agricultural products had successfully eliminated piracy in the Malacca Strait which inspired Sultan Ali's decree in naming Sungai Balang after their courage against the pirates in the Malacca Straits which were considered as great prowess achieved only by warlords (Hulubalang in Malay). According to history, Mukim Sungai Balang was a gazetted areas including Sarang Buaya Kiri, Sarang Buaya Kanan and Sungai Balang and administered by a headman titled \\"Orang Kaya\\" and the two vice- headman. This administration ended in 1954 when the three areas were merged into a county (mukim) and given the name Mukim Sungai Balang. Among the historic reminiscences in Sungai Balang existing today is the grave of Orang Kaya Ali in the Muslim cemetery in the town and the village primary school named Sekolah Kebangsaan Orang Kaya Ali after the founder of Sungai Balang. One of the descendants of Orang Kaya Ali is his grandson who still living, Abdul Manaf bin Abu Bakar, owner of Toko Buku Manaf, the already closed famous bookstore in Jalan Abdullah, Muar. While the descendants of Orang Kaya Omar (headman Muar) is the cousin of Orang Kaya Ali, is the former Speaker of the Parliament-Dewan Rakyat, the late Tan Sri Mohamad Noah bin Omar, father of Tun Rahah Mohd Noah (the widow of Tun Abdul Razak, Malaysian 2nd Prime Minister and mother of Dato Seri Najib Abdul Razak, current Malaysian 6th Prime Minister) and Tun Suhaila Mohd Noah (the widow of Tun Hussein Onn, Malaysian 3rd Prime Minister and mother of minister Dato Seri Hishammuddin Hussein).

She was never empress, but as she was the wife of Xiao Zhangmao, the oldest son and crown prince of Emperor Wu, who was posthumously honored as an emperor, and the mother of his son Xiao Zhaoye, who later became emperor, she was considered an empress. Biography Early life Wang Baoming's grandfather, Wang Shaozhi (王韶之), and father, Wang Yezhi (王曄之), were mid-level officials during Liu Song. During the reign of Emperor Houfei of Liu Song, when Xiao Daocheng was a Liu Song general, Xiao Daocheng had already taken her as his grandson Xiao Zhangmao's wife, and in 473 she gave birth to Xiao Zhangmao's oldest son Xiao Zhaoye. In 474, when Xiao Daocheng's mansion was being ransacked by pillagers during the rebellion of Emperor Houfei's uncle Liu Xiufan (劉休範) the Prince of Guiyang, Xiao Zhangmao and his brother Xiao Ziliang (蕭子良) took Wang Baoming, Xiao Zhangmao's mother Pei Huizhao (裴惠昭), and Lady Yu, the wife of Xiao Zhangmao's uncle Xiao Ni and took refuge in the house of Wang Baoming's Wang Bing (王昺), and did not leave until Liu Xiufan's rebellion had been suppressed by Xiao Daocheng. During Southern Qi After Xiao Daocheng took over the throne in 479, ending Liu Song and establishing Southern Qi (as its Emperor Gao), Xiao Zhangmao, as his oldest grandson, was created the Prince of Nan Commandery, and Wang Baoming became the Princess of Nan Commandery. After Emperor Gao died in 482 and was succeeded by Xiao Zhangmao's father Xiao Ze (as Emperor Wu), Xiao Zhangmao was created crown prince, and Princess Wang became crown princess. She was not favored by Xiao Zhangmao, and it was said that while the luxury-loving crown prince gave many of his concubines new clothes and jewelry, the crown princess was using old items. After Xiao Zhangmao died in early 493, Xiao Zhaoye was created crown prince, and Crown Princess Wang carried the title of crown princess dowager. After Emperor Wu died later that year, Xiao Zhaoye succeeded him as emperor, and he honored her as empress dowager, setting her household at Xuande Palace (宣德宮), thus giving rise to her later semi-formal title. In a rather unusual action, he gave her 30 male attendants who were not eunuchs; however, whether they were serving as her lovers is not clear. Whether truthful or not, they have, however, been referred to as her male concubines.Keith McMahon: Celestial Women: Imperial Wives and Concubines in China from Song to Qing In 494, Xiao Zhaoye was assassinated by the prime minister Xiao Luan, who, issuing an edict in Empress Dowager Wang's name, posthumously deposed him and demoted him to the title of Prince of Yulin. Xiao Luan continued to honor her as empress dowager, and initially made Xiao Zhangmao's son by his concubine Lady Xu, Xiao Zhaowen, emperor, although he himself controlled the regime. Later that year, he deposed (again in the name of Empress Dowager Wang) and killed Xiao Zhaowen as well, taking over the throne personally (as Emperor Ming). Empress Dowager Wang, while still carrying her title, vacated the palace and took up residence at the old mansion of Emperor Wu's brother Xiao Qiang (蕭鏘) the Prince of Poyang, whom Xiao Luan had killed as well, and the residence became known as Xuande Palace as well. Death Empress Dowager Wang's activities during the reigns of Emperor Ming and his son Xiao Baojuan are not completely clear. In 501, after a military rebellion by the general Xiao Yan had led to the death of Xiao Baojuan, Xiao Yan formally had Empress Dowager Wang become regent, even though he was actually in power, and it was in an edict issued in her name that Xiao Baojuan was demoted to the title of Marquess of Donghun. In 502, Xiao Yan had Xiao Baojuan's brother Emperor He, whom he had put on the throne in 501 during his rebellion, yield the throne to him, and Empress Dowager Wang issued an edict confirming the transfer as well, formally ending Southern Qi and starting Liang Dynasty. Empress Dowager Wang was given a convoluted title of \\"Princess of Emperor Wen of Qi.\\" She died in 512 and was posthumously honored as empress and buried with her husband Xiao Zhangmao, with imperial honors.

Due to varying definitions of the term \\"circumnavigation,\\" debate has arisen as to whether or not the route travelled fulfilled the strictest criteria (for further discussion, see World Circumnavigation). As part of the circumnavigation, Angus and his then fiancé Julie Wafaei (now Julie Angus) made the first rowboat crossing of the Atlantic Ocean from mainland Europe to mainland North America, and Wafaei became the first Canadian woman to row across any ocean. Colin and Julie have two sons: Leif, born September, 2010, and Oliver, born June, 2014. Colin rowing across the Atlantic Ocean Other expeditions Angus has completed include the first descent of the Yenisei River (the world's fifth longest river); a complete descent of the Amazon River from source to sea; from Scotland to Syria by bicycle and rowboat; and sailing from Spain to the Middle East investigating the domestication of the olive tree. Angus has written four books: Lost in Mongolia (2003), Amazon Extreme (2004), Beyond the Horizon (2007), and Rowed Trip (2009). He has co-produced two films for National Geographic Television. These include \\"Boiling Water and Bullets\\" covering the Amazon River, as well as a film on the Yenisey River in Mongolia . Outside Magazine included Colin Angus in a compilation of 25 people changing the world in its December 2005 issue. Colin and Julie are active speakers , and were participants in Canada's ideacity . Colin is a rowboat advocate and designer, and was recognized by Carl Cramer, Publisher for Wooden Boat Magazine, for a unique \\"camper\\" rowboat that allows for a sleeping berth yet has very low wind resistance . In 2011 Colin rowed the 1,100 km (683 miles) around Vancouver Island in 15 days, 11 hours, and 47 minutes, setting a new record for the fastest human powered circumnavigation of the island . Colin also writes a monthly column for the magazine Explore , addressing a wide range of subjects such as fund raising, camping, diets, exercise, and his philosophy of rowboats and long distance rowing. On this last point he advocates sliding seat rowing as an efficient way of propelling a boat, since it promotes a full body workout, uses all the major muscles, and is also conducive to two person, continuous travel. Colin and Julie have also modeled clothing for Helly Hansen, and did a catalogue photoshoot with them in Chamonix, France. Adventures Pacific Ocean Colin Angus began his adventuring lifestyle at nineteen with a five-year sailing odyssey in the Pacific Ocean, half of it done with his best friend Dan Audet. Amazon River In 1999, along with Australian Ben Kozel and South African Scott Borthwick, he was among the first to raft the Amazon river from source to sea. The trio retraced the route of Polish kayaker Piotr Chmieliński's 1986 historic first-ever descent of the Amazon River from source to sea, which used a kayak. Yenise River To follow up the rafting of the Amazon, Angus put together a team which would accomplish the same task on the previously untraversed Yenisei River in Asia. Around the World Colin Angus's trip around the world by bike, canoe, rowboat and foot Angus traveled around the world using exclusively human power, walking and biking across land and rowing across water, completing his journey in July 2004. The expedition began with partner Tim Harvey. However, in Siberia the pair parted ways due to interpersonal conflict. Harvey continued and eventually circled the planet, but on a longer route than Angus, including Africa and South America . Angus was joined bicycling in Europe by his then fianceé Julie Wafaei, who purchased a rowboat for them to cross the Atlantic. The British adventurer Jason Lewis, claims that Angus' journey was not a circumnavigation, because it did not pass through two antipodal points on the globe, although this is not required by Guinness World Records . The ship's log on the Russian research vessel Professor Khromov cite a high-seas rescue in support of the expedition. Angus had to fly to Canada for medical treatment during the expedition, but flew back to Russia to continue from the point he had left beforehand. Julie and Colin's route from Scotland to Syria via rowboat and bicycle Scotland to Syria In 2008 Colin and his wife, Julie Angus, completed a trip from northernmost Scotland to Syria, covering 7,000 km (4,350 miles) of rivers and roads. Each used a separate rowboat on the water sections, and portaged using bicycle-trailer systems between waterways. This expedition was described in their book \\"Rowed Trip, From Scotland to Syria by Oar\\" published in 2009, as well as a film titled \\"Rowed Trip.\\" Vancouver Island Circumnavigation In 2011 Colin rowed the 1,100 km (683 miles) around Vancouver Island in 15 days, 11 hours, and 47 minutes, setting a new record for the fastest human powered circumnavigation of the island . The previous record was held by Joe O'Blenis, set in 2010, who circumnavigated in 16 days, 12 hours and 14 minutes in a kayak . Colin's record was broken in June, 2014 by Kayaker Russell Henry in 12 days, 23 hours, and 45 minutes. Colin and Julie's route from Spain to Syria Olive Odyssey Also in 2011, Colin, his wife Julie Angus, and their young son Leif sailed from Spain to the Middle-East, retracing the domestication of the olive tree. Their adventure is described in Julie's most recent book, \\"Olive Odyssey: Searching for the Secrets of the Fruit that Seduced the World\\". Yukon River In 2013 Colin and partner Steven Price attempted to set a human-powered only record for the fastest time down a 440-mile stretch of the Yukon River between the towns of Whitehorse and Dawson City, Yukon, Canada. The previous record was set in 2008 during the Yukon River Quest,http://www.yukonriverquest.com/ with a total elapsed time of 49 hours 32 minutes set by a 6-person canoe. Colin and Steven took 50 hours 50 minutes in a rowboat with one rowing station, missing the record by 1 hour 18 minutes, making them the fourth fastest in history for total elapsed time, and the only recorded non-stop river trip between these two towns.http://www.whitehorsestar.com/Sports/paddling-duo-completes-personal- quest-in-rowboathttp://newsok.com/article/3862277 Race to Alaska For the 2016 Race to Alaska (R2AK), a 750-mile all-water race from Port Townsend to Ketchikan, Alaska, Colin placed first in the solo category as well as first in boats under 20 feet in length. Colin sailed and rowed a ketch rigged rowboat. Colin's time for the 2016 R2AK was 13 days one hour and 59 minutes. Open Ocean Robotics With Julie Angus Colin has launched a new company called Open Ocean Robotics . The purpose of the company is to develop autonomous boats powered by wind and/or solar power capable of deep ocean travel.

His feature film debut, it was his second film after the short The Dead Father. Tales from the Gimli Hospital was shot in black and white on 16 mm film and stars Kyle McCulloch as Einar, a lonely fisherman who contracts smallpox and begins to compete with another patient, Gunnar (played by Michael Gottli) for the attention of the young nurses. Maddin had himself endured a recent period of male rivalry and noticed that he found himself \\"quite often forgetting the object of jealousy\\" and instead becoming \\"possessive of my rival.\\" The film was originally titled Gimli Saga after the amateur history book produced locally by various Icelandic members of the community of Gimli (Maddin himself is Icelandic by ancestry).Vatnsdal, Caelum. Kino Delirium: The Films of Guy Maddin. Winnipeg: Arbeiter Ring Publishing, 2000. Print. Maddin's aunt Lil had recently retired from hairdressing, and allowed Maddin to use her beauty salon (also Maddin's childhood home) as a makeshift film studio (Lil appears in the film briefly as a \\"bedside vigil-sitter in one quick shot [taken] just a couple of days before she died\\" at the age of 85. After Maddin's mother sold the house/studio, Maddin completed the remaining shots of the film at various locations, including his own home, over a period of eighteen months. Maddin received a grant from the Manitoba Arts Council for $20,000 and often cites that figure as the film's budget, although also estimates the actual budget between $14,000 and $30,000.  Plot  The film opens on two young children whose mother is dying in the present-day Gimli, Manitoba hospital. During a visit to see her, the children's Icelandic grandmother launches into the grim and convoluted tale of Einar the Lonely, a patient in a far-distant-past version of the same hospital—in \\"a Gimli we no longer know,\\" as the grandmother puts it. The rest of the film consists of Einar's story. Einar (Kyle McCulloch) succumbs to a smallpox epidemic and is admitted to the Gimli hospital for treatment, where he meets his neighbor Gunnar (Michael Gottli). While both are at first pleased to have a friend nearby in their time of illness, the two men soon begin competing for the attentions and affections of the hospital's beautiful young nurses. Gunnar outperforms Einar in this regard, given his storytelling abilities and his skill at carving birch bark into the shape of fish. The hospital is built above a stable (for heat from the animals) and director Maddin appears in a cameo as a surgeon who operates while patients are told to observe a badly-acted puppet show as a sort of anesthesia. Gunnar borrows Einar's fish-carving shears and recognizes the decorated pair of shears as uncannily similar to those he buried with his wife Snjófridur (Angela Heck). Gunnar recalls the story of their courtship and her death from smallpox she contracted from Gunnar. His aboriginal friend, despite Gunnar's protests, then laid her body to rest in the traditional aboriginal manner, on a raised platform with tokens and gifts including the shears. Einar relates to Gunnar the story of how he came to possess the shears: while wandering in the dark one night he discovered the corpse of a beautiful woman on a raised burial platform (who he now realizes must have been Snjófridur). Einar stole the tokens buried with her and had sex with her corpse. Gunnar is furious but too weak to take immediate revenge on Einar, and coincidentally a fire breaks out on the hospital roof. The Icelanders put out the fire by pouring milk over it, which then drips down into Gunnar's face and blinds him. A blackfaced minstrel is buried and Einar contemplates further destroying Gunnar through carving him up with the selfsame shears stolen from his wife's corpse. Einar and Gunnar exit the hospital and wander around feverishly. Einar observes Lord Dufferin giving a public speech. Einar hallucinates that Lord Dufferin is the mythical Fish Princess. The men end up in a field together along with a Shriners Highland Pipe Band and begin to Glima Wrestle—a traditional competition where fighters graps each other's buttocks and take turns lifting one another up until one collapses. They tear each other's clothes and claw at each other's buttocks until they bleed, then both collapse. Einar is later back in his small shack/fish smokehouse and is visited by a recovered and no-longer-blind Gunnar and his new fiance. They happily saunter along the beach of Lake Winnipeg while Einar regards them jealously, still Einar the Lonely. The scene returns to the present-day Gimli where the children are informed that their mother has died. They ask the storytelling Amma to be their mother and she says \\"no\\" but that she will still visit \\"if your father lets me.\\" They ask about heaven and she prepares to tell another story as the film ends.

Nevertheless, it became a cult success and established Maddin's reputation in independent film circles. The film garnered the attention of Ben Barenholtz, who had successfully distributed other cult films such as the John Waters film Pink Flamingos and David Lynch's debut feature Eraserhead. Tales from the Gimli Hospital consequently screened for a full year as a midnight movie at the Quad Theatre in New York's Greenwich Village. Maddin received a Genie Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay as well, although the script consisted of a series of Post-it notes. Along with Maddin's debut short film, The Dead Father, Tales from the Gimli Hospital was released to home video on DVD.Tales from the Gimli Hospital. Dir. Guy Maddin. Kino Video, 2000. DVD.  Critical reception  The film received generally positive reviews, with review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reporting a 71% approval rating based on 7 reviews. Reviewers, although generally positive, also seemed perplexed by the film: Jonathan Rosenbaum commented on its \\"moment-to-moment invention and genuine weirdness\\" and Noel Murray of the Onion A.V. Club similarly noted that \\"[Maddin] self-consciously borrows from dozens of sources, including radio dramas, Our Gang shorts, hygiene films, school plays, stag pictures, Universal horror, ethnographic documentaries, and the indie weirdness of John Waters and David Lynch.\\" The 1989 review in The New York Times referred to its \\"midnight-cult status\\" and lengthy run at New York's Quad Cinema, and noted that \\"Many bits of [the film's] seemingly surreal business supposedly draw on ancient Icelandic customs, like using oil squeezed from fish as a hair pomade, cleaning the face with straw, and sleeping under dirt blankets.\\"  Awards and nominations  Genie Awards: *Nominated: Best Original Screenplay – Guy Maddin  References   External links   * 1988 films Canadian black-and-white films Canadian films English-language films Films directed by Guy Maddin Icelandic-language films Gimli, Manitoba Films set in Manitoba 1988 directorial debut films ","title":"Tales from the Gimli Hospital"},{"id":"5792915","text":"Sungai Panjang is a mukim in Sabak Bernam District, Selangor, Malaysia.http://apps.water.gov.my/jpskomuniti/dokumen/profile%20daerah%20sabak%20bernam%2028%20Nov%202014.pdf Notable residents *Dato Seri Dr Mohammad Khir Toyo former Menteri Besar (Chief Minister) of Selangor References Mukims of Selangor ","title":"Sungai Panjang"},{"id":"5792927","text":"Padang Jawa is a kampung and a suburb of Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia.

Located on the corner of Broadway and Vesey Street in what is now the Civic Center and Tribeca neighborhoods of Lower Manhattan, it opened in 1836 and soon became the best known hotel in America. History and description The Astor House was built by John Jacob Astor, who assembled the lots around his former house until he had purchased the full block in the heart of the city's most fashionable residential district. Construction began in 1834,Stone, May N. \\"Astor House\\" in , p.73 and the hotel opened in June 1836 as the Park Hotel. It was located on the west side of Broadway between Vesey and Barclay Streets, across from City Hall Park and diagonally across from the offices of the New York Herald. The building was designed by Isaiah Rogers, who in 1829 had designed the first luxury hotel in the United States, the Tremont House, in Boston. The large four-square block\\" The simple, square, unornamented architecture of the Astor House, makes to my notion, the best appearance of any building in New York, observed Walt Whitman (Whitman, Whitman in 1850: Three Uncollected Articles R.G. Silver, ed, (1951). was detailed in the Greek Revival style, faced with pale granite ashlar with quoined corners treated as at Tremont House, as embedded Doric pillars, and a central entrance flanked by Greek Doric columns supporting a short length of entablature.\\"The Astor House in 1900\\"; \\"Bootblacks before the entrance of Astor House, 1896\\", photograph by Alice Austen. Astor House contained 309 rooms in five stories, with servant's rooms on the sixth floor, whose mezzanine windows opened in the frieze below the building's cornice. It had gaslights - the gas was produced in the hotel's own plantBurrows & Wallace (1999), pp.600-601 - and bathing and toilet facilities on each floor, with the water pumped up by steam engines. Its tree-shaded central courtyard was covered over in 1852 by an elliptical vaulted cast-iron and glass \\"rotunda\\" designed by James Bogardus,Gayle, Margot and Gayle, Carol, Cast-iron architecture in America p. 117f, 1901 photograph of the \\"rotunda\\", p. 118. that under the direction of its proprietor \\"Col.\\" Charles A. Stetson (1837–1877) was the city's most stylish luncheon place for gentlemen. It featured a curving bar, and side dining rooms entered from Vesey Street or Barclay Street. Guests could order from 30 meat and fish dishes offered daily. Although by the 1850s some restaurants allowed men and women to dine together, and others had special ladies' dining room with separate entrances to reserved drawing rooms, the Astor House would not admit unaccompanied women to enter, a policy which prevented prostitutes from nearby brothels from plying their trade in the hotel.Burrows & Wallace (1999), p.814 Guests to the hotel could take a horsecar directly there from the Madison Square Depot of the New York and Harlem Railroad.Burrows & Wallace (1999), p.656 St. Paul's Chapel, Astor House, U.S. Post Office, c.1905 Notable guests and events alt= For decades, the Astor House was the best known and most prestigious hotel in the countryGray, Christopher \\"Streetscapes: Where Lincoln Tossed and Turned\\" The New York Times (September 24, 2009)Burrows & Wallace (1999), p.436 and had an international reputation as the place where renowned literary figures and statesmen met. Mathew Brady lived there in the 1840s, and William James was born there in 1842. In 1843, the Astor House hosted the recently married Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his wife. The couple, who renewed their friendship with fellow patron Fanny Kemble, also dined there with Nathaniel Parker Willis and his wife during their stay.Tharp, Louise Hall. The Appletons of Beacon Hill. Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1973: 241–242. The Norwegian violinist Ole Bull was a returning patron at the hotel on his American tours in the 1840s, 50s, and 60s. Abraham Lincoln stayed there in February 1861 on his way to his inauguration and gave an impromptu speech, and in 1864 Thurlow Weed ran Lincoln's re-election campaign from the hotel.Burrows & Wallace (1999), p.902 Afterwards, on November 25, 1864, Confederate sympathizers set fires in 13 major hotels in the city, many of them along Broadway, including the Astor House; the fires were soon put out.Burrows & Wallace (1999), p.903 American Civil War Confederate Admiral Raphael Semmes stayed at Astor House twice. His first stay was in March 1861, on the eve of the war, when he was searching for ships to buy for the fledgling Confederate Navy. Nearly five years later, on December 27, 1865, he again spent the night, this time as a prisoner of the North, while being escorted to the Washington Navy Yard where Federal authorities would decide whether to put him on trial. The hotel was used as a safe haven during the Great Blizzard of 1888. In 1916, Charles Evans Hughes stayed there while his presidential bid stood in the balance. Marc Eidlitz & Sons Competition and decline The success of the Astor House invited competition. The 1853 St Nicholas Hotel on Broadway at Broome Street was built for $1 million and offered the innovation of central heating that circulated warmed air through registers to every room. It was said to have ended the Astor House's preeminence in New York hostelry. The Metropolitan Hotel, opened in 1852 just north of the St Nicholas at Prince Street, was equally luxurious. But the new hotel to put all others in the shade was the Fifth Avenue Hotel facing Madison Square.Morris, Lloyd R. Incredible New York 1975:5. In the face of its competitors, by the early 1870s the Astor House was considered old-fashioned and unappealing, and was principally used by businessmen. Still, it remained such a seemingly permanent fixture of New York, that it was included in a fantasy short story by J. A. Mitchell, \\"The Last American\\", set in the far future, when Persian explorers in the ruins of New York come upon \\"an upturned slab\\" inscribed \\"Astor House\\": \\"I pointed it out to Nofuhl and we bent over it with eager eyes ...

Biography Farberman studied percussion at Juilliard, and composition at the New England Conservatory and at Tanglewood with Aaron Copland. In 1951, he joined the Boston Symphony Orchestra as the youngest player ever to become a full-time member of the orchestra. Farberman's conducting positions included principal guest conductor of the Denver Symphony Orchestra in 1963, and music director and conductor of the Colorado Springs Orchestra from 1967 to 1970, and the Oakland Symphony Orchestra (later reorganized as the Oakland East Bay Symphony) from 1971 to 1979, where he gave a rare concert performance of Scott Joplin's folk opera Treemonisha. During Farberman's tenure with the Oakland Symphony, there were concerns about his work as music director, and his difficult relationship with the orchestra. When his contract was to be renewed in 1977, the Players' Committee expressed its profound dissatisfaction with his work and the majority voted that his contract should not be renewed, but the orchestra board decided to renew it against the musicians' wishes.Beene, Mitchell and Johnson, Autopsy of an Orchestra: an Analysis of the Factors Contributing to the Bankruptcy of the Oackland Symphony Orchestra. © 1988, 2012 Melanie Beene He championed the work of Charles Ives, having recorded more of his works than any other conductor, including all four of his symphonies. He also recorded the complete symphonies of Gustav Mahler and Michael Haydn with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Bournemouth Sinfonietta, respectively. Farberman founded the Conductors' Guild in 1976, and was founder and director of the Conductors' Institute, a summer conducting program initiated at the Hartt School, and now located at Bard College. Marin Alsop, a graduate of this program, was one of his most notable students. Farberman was also the author of The Art of Conducting Technique. Farberman's compositions included three operas; many works for orchestra and chamber ensembles; the film score to the Academy Award–winning documentary, The Great American Cowboy; and music for dance companies.

It is located in the Tankerness area of Orkney, Scotland, about 5 miles (8 km) southeast of Kirkwall, the capital of Orkney. The origin of the howe (from Old Norse word haugr meaning barrow) is not perfectly understood. Experts believe that it was built roughly 2000 years ago during the Iron Age. There is some similarity to the well inside the Iron Age Broch of Gurness. Description Mine Howe excavations Its walls are lined with stones fitted to form an arch over the cavity and 29 steps lead to a rock floor. The entrance is at the top of the small hill and there are indications of other Iron Age and earlier activity around the site. A flight of stone steps descend to a half-landing where they turn back on themselves and further steps descend to a chamber. This chamber is only about in diameter but is over four metres high with a corbelled roof. The bottom step into this chamber is high and gives it a cistern-like appearance. At the half-landing two subsidiary chambers/passages open out, one above the other. Most of the structure is lined with beautifully built dry-stone walling.Minehowe - The Earth mound in Tankerness Discovery It was first explored in 1946 and misidentified as an Iron Age broch. After the 1940s excavations were finished, Mine Howe was covered over and left untouched and nearly forgotten for almost 50 years. Douglas Paterson, a farmer who owned the land at the time, rediscovered the site in 1999. He removed material that had filled in during the intervening years and built a small wooden entrance over the opening. He built stairs leading down into the chamber and allowed visitors inside.Mine Howe, Orkney In June 2000, the archaeological television programme Time Team came to Mine Howe to help with further excavations and explore the structure. In order to work out how it had been built, Time Team had a small replica built nearby. Sections of a ditch surrounding the mound were also excavated, along with what was apparently an earthen path allowing visitors access to the site.

Criticism of the Center and its director The Awareness Center drew sharp criticism for publishing and publicizing rumors, accusations and allegations without verification. The Center routinely relied on anonymous blogs and other sources of dubious credibility to profile alleged sexual predators. Some who were listed by name were never sued or charged with any offense, or even accused by a verifiable source. Rabbi Mark Dratch, chair of the Rabbinical Council of America's Task Force on Rabbinic Improprieties and founder of the organization JSafe, which addresses domestic violence and child abuse in the Jewish community, withdrew his support from the Center because its use of unreliable sources was victimizing the falsely accused. \\"I wasn't satisfied with the threshold of verification. There are people who've been victimized and others who've been subject to false reports also being victimized.\\" Rabbi Avi Shafran, spokesman for the Orthodox Agudath Israel of America group, also criticized the Center for using material from anonymous blogs. \\"The blogorai, as I call it, is the new way of making irresponsible accusations,\\" he said. \\"Using a blog is a very easy and effective way of casting aspersions on people.\\" Despite his words of general support for the Center, Rabbi Yosef Blau agreed, saying \\"since they are anonymous, they can say almost anything.\\" Rabbi Tzvi Hersh Weinreb, executive vice president of the Orthodox Union and a trained psychologist, said that while the Awareness Center and the blogs \\"have served the purpose of keeping this in the public spotlight and keeping the pressure on established institutions to police their constituencies... I read everything with a grain of salt.\\" Jeff Bell, writing in the July 2008 issue of Catalyst magazine, went further, accusing the center's director of misusing the organization as a tool for defamation: > She now claims to be a victim’s advocate; but her advocacy seems to have > taken all the aspects of vigilante misanthrope, and the power of the blog is > her weapon. Polin has a singular focus to not only expose, but to destroy > the life and reputation of whatever person that falls into her sights, > regardless of facts.

Appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show  In 1989, before founding the Center, Polin was a guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Appearing under a pseudonym, she claimed that she was a survivor of a secret, Jewish Satanic cult, in which she, her family, and others had sacrificed babies to the devil. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and a host of other Jewish organizations sharply criticized Winfrey for publicizing an obviously false blood libel and thereby helping to perpetuate anti-Semitism.Gerard, Jeremy, Winfrey Show Evokes Protests, New York Times, (1989-05-06). Rabbi David Saperstein of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism criticized Winfrey in the New York Times for \\"insensitive manipulation\\" of someone who was \\"clearly mentally ill.\\" He said the result \\"can only inflame the basest prejudices of ignorant people.\\" Footage of the video has been posted to YouTube and used by anti- Semitic websites to \\"prove\\" the existence of Jewish Satanic cults. In 2009, Polin addressed the controversy directly: > I have never made it a secret that I am a survivor of child sexual abuse, > nor have I hidden the fact that I appeared on several television and radio > shows back in the 1980s sharing my story in hopes of reaching out to other > survivors and educating the general public about the issues and > ramifications child abuse plays on its victims. > Back on May 1, 1989, I appeared on the Oprah Show.

The town is located about 20 minutes from the Sepang International Circuit and about 25 minutes from the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The town is near Bagan Lalang beach and Golden Coast Sepang. It has numerous mangrove forests and the local clay supports a thriving brick-making industry. Etymology Local legend has it that Sungai Pelek got its name from the temporary river formed by the overflow of the Sungai Sepang and Sungai Sepang Kecil during high tide. In the local Malay dialect, \\"sungai\\" meant \\"river, and \\"pelek\\" meant \\"strange\\" or \\"unusual\\". This \\"strange/unusual\\" river lasted only for as long as the high tide, as most of the water would have drained out to sea by low tide. History During the Second World War, Sungai Pelek was under the control of the Japanese. There was active local resistance to the Japanese occupation. Some British military personnel were trapped in Sungai Pelek by the advancing Japanese forces. These British soldiers were aided in their escape by Mr Lim Yee Ko and his friends. The Communist insurgency during the 1950s, also known colloquially as \\"The Emergency\\", saw the building of a chain-link fence around the village. Up until the 1970s, remnants of the fence could still be seen around the village but these are now largely overgrown or have been torn down to make way for the burgeoning population growth. Notable Village Headman Ong Eng Siang, PJK (born 1910 - 1989) A natural leader and highly looked up to by most of the villagers. He was often being sought to help solve problems faced by individuals or families in Sungai Pelek. Ong Eng Siang was given a walking stick by Sir Gerald Templer as a symbol of respect and \\"authority to cane\\" the Assistant District Officers (ADOs) should they not do their job well. Sir Gerald Templer was in Sungai Pelek with his military trucks to evict and remove the villagers to other locations just to overcome the British frustrations of Sungai Pelek being heavily infested with communist guerillas and their sympathisers. The villagers were suspected to be frequent suppliers of food and medicine materials to the communist guerillas. In order to eliminate this chain, Sir Gerald Templer was adamant to evict and re- distribute the villagers to other areas. Ong Eng Siang was among the then village community leaders to convince and appeal to Sir Gerald Templer to change his decision and to understand the problems faced by the villagers who had to scratch for a living at the fringes of the forests, risking their lives daily should they be confronted by communist guerillas. The villagers knew too well that the security forces of the government could never protect them every day from the communist guerillas. Therefore, they had to oblige reluctantly with fear for their lives and family members, to supply rations whenever the villagers were asked to do so by the communist guerillas. Communist guerillas also did do their rounds, knocking on doors in the village, in the wee hours of the night to source for rations. Therefore, Sir Gerald Templer had to acknowledged the legitimate fears and dilemma faced by the villagers of Sungai Pelek. In order to reduce constant contact between the villagers and communist guerillas, Sir Gerald Templer ordered the village to be completely fenced-up around its perimeters, leaving a few gates strategically located as entrances. These gates were heavily guarded by police and home guards. Demographics The population of the village are predominantly Chinese of Hokkien origin. There are also ethnic Malays, who are mainly of Javanese/Sumatran descent, and Indians, who are a mixture of Tamils, Singhalese and Bengalis, in this small town. The Chinese are distributed amongst the New Village and various housing developments known collectively as Taman-taman. A large number of the Chinese are still connected to the land as land farmers. Pig farming was devastated by the JE virus. Around the village are some smaller settlements like Bukit Bangkong, Batu Empat, Batu Dua, Teluk Merbau, and Sepang Kecil. Bukit Bangkong was a small aboriginal settlement, which now houses a predominantly Javanese Malay population. Batu Empat and Batu Dua are small Malay settlements on the road to Sepang town from Sungai Pelek. There are few small Indian settlements built by the local palm oil company. The settlements consisted of dwellings mainly occupied by Tamil-speaking Indians, with some Malays and small number of Chinese. Religion The main religious communities in Sungai Pelek are split between Buddhists, Taoists, Hindus, Methodist Christians and Muslims. There are also a small number of Catholic Christians and Sikhs. In Sungai Pelek, there are several Chinese temples like Long Shan Ting Temple (雙溪比力龙山亭) and Boo Teck Tong Temple (雙溪比力武德堂-元帥爺公). Xuan Tian Gong Temple (雙溪比力玄天宫) is located inside the main town. Bodhivana Monastery (Buddhist Education Centre) is located at Sungai Pelek, Sepang near the Avani Sepang Gold Coast Resort. The centre is guided by Bhante Dhammapala, and it is to promote Buddhism and to benefit the community through Buddhist Education, Meditation, Arts and Community Engagement. There are also other Buddhist groups like Sungai Pelek Buddhist Association (双溪比力佛教会) and their youth group, Sg Pelek Young Buddhist Society (双溪比力佛教会青少年团). Sungai Pelek also consist of other places of worship like a small Methodist church preaching in Chinese, a Catholic chapel situated behind the Post Office building, a mosque for the local Muslims. Sri Ganesha Indian temple is located approximately 300 meters from the main town, neighbouring Taman Sri Sungai Pelek. The Dewi Sri Karumariamman temple also located 150 meters from the main town, neighbouring Taman Aman and Taman Sentosa. Education Sungai Pelek has several schools which serve the local community. These schools provide educational instruction in Chinese, Indian, Malay and English. The educational level of these schools ranges from primary education to secondary education. The first headmaster of the private Chinese primary school, Wah Lian Chinese School, the Tamil school which served the local Indian population were set up by the government which is located near Taman Teluk Merbau. Economy Besides its thriving brick-making and clay products industry, Sungai Pelek has numerous small plantations of rubber trees, coffea plants and oil palms. It is home to the prized teka, tawa and pinoh durians. Recently, dragon fruit has also been planted widely here. The people of Sungai Pelek are active in the bird's nest industry as well.

It was originally opened by the Great Central Railway, as The Hotel Great Central. As one of London's railway hotels it declined after the advent of the motor car, and served as a military convalescent home during the Second World War, and later the headquarters of the British Railways Board. It reopened as a hotel in 1993. Early history The hotel was originally one of London's Victorian era railway hotels, The Hotel Great Central. It was first proposed by Sir Edward Watkin of the Great Central Railway who envisaged Marylebone station, which the hotel was to serve, as the hub of an international railway which would run through a channel tunnel. Sir Edward's aspirations proved to be overambitious (not for the only time as he was behind the Watkins' Tower, which was a failed attempt to outdo the Eiffel Tower), and after the Great Central ran into financial difficulties the site of the hotel was sold to Sir John Blundell Maple of the furniture company Maples, who opened his hotel in 1899. Marylebone station is one of the smallest of the central London termini, but its hotel was among the grandest of the London railway hotels. It had a clock tower and was built around a large central courtyard. There were two main entrances, one on the northern side facing the station and the other on the southern side towards Marylebone Road. The architect was Colonel Sir Robert William Edis and the style was eclectic and opulent. The Ladies' Alpine Club rented rooms in the hotel and held its annual dinner there. Decline and military usage In the 1920s the central courtyard became a winter garden, but the building's first period as a hotel was drawing to a close. With railway traffic falling due to the advent of the motor car, London's railway hotels were among the most vulnerable of the city's grand hotels as they were not in the most fashionable districts. The Great Central fell out of hotel use for over forty years. It was a convalescent home during the Second World War and served as a military office building for many years afterwards as well as the headquarters of the British Railways Board, and was referred to by railway staff as \\"The Kremlin\\".Dr John Prideaux at Alycidon Railtalk May 2002 Return to prominence In a pattern which was followed by several of the railway hotels it later returned to its original use, as demand for luxury hotels in London grew and the city centre expanded in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The building was purchased by a Japanese company in 1986 and reopened as a hotel in 1993, under the name of The Regent, London. In 1995, it was purchased by the Lancaster Landmark Hotel Company Limited, and renamed The Landmark London. The Landmark Group is a Thai company which opened its first hotel in 1987 and owns several other hotels in London. The hotel now has 300 rooms and suites.

Construction of the basilica, built over the historical site of the Circus of Nero, began during the reign of Emperor Constantine I. The name \\"old St. Peter's Basilica\\" has been used since the construction of the current basilica to distinguish the two buildings. An early interpretation of the relative locations of the Circus of Nero, and the old and current Basilicas of St. Peter A map, circa 1590, by Tiberio Alfarano of the interior of Old Saint Peter's, noting the locations of the original chapels and tombsReardon, 2004 .p.274 Fontana della Pigna (1st century AD) which stood in the courtyard of the Old St. Peter's Basilica during the Middle Ages and then moved again, in 1608, to a vast niche in the wall of the Vatican facing the Cortile della Pigna, located in Vatican City, in Rome, Italy. History Construction began by orders of the Roman Emperor Constantine I between 318 and 322,Marian Moffett, Michael Fazio, Lawrence Wodehouse, A World History of Architecture, 2nd edition 2008, pp. 135 and took about 40 years to complete. Over the next twelve centuries, the church gradually gained importance, eventually becoming a major place of pilgrimage in Rome. Papal coronations were held at the basilica, and in 800, Charlemagne was crowned emperor of the Holy Roman Empire there. In 846, Saracens sacked and damaged the basilica.Davis, Raymond, The Lives of the Ninth-Century Popes (Liber pontificalis), (Liverpool University Press, 1995), 96. The raiders seem to have known about Rome's extraordinary treasures. Some holy—and impressive—basilicas, such as St. Peter's Basilica, were outside the Aurelian walls, and thus easy targets. They were \\"filled to overflowing with rich liturgical vessels and with jeweled reliquaries housing all of the relics recently amassed\\". As a result, the raiders destroyed Saint Peter's tomb and pillaged the holy shrine.Barbara Kreutz (1996). Before the Normans: Southern Italy in the Ninth and Tenth Centuries. University of Pennsylvania Press pp. 25–28. In response Pope Leo IV built the Leonine wall and rebuilt the parts of St. Peter's that had been damaged.Rosemary Guiley, The Encyclopedia of Saints, (InfoBase Publishing, 2001), 208. By the 15th century the church was falling into ruin. Discussions on repairing parts of the structure commenced upon the pope's return from Avignon. Two people involved in this reconstruction were Leon Battista Alberti and Bernardo Rossellino, who improved the apse and partially added a multi-story benediction loggia to the atrium facade, on which construction continued intermittently until the new basilica was begun. Alberti pronounced the basilica a structural abomination: At first Pope Julius II had every intention of preserving the old building, but his attention soon turned toward tearing it down and building a new structure. Many people of the time were shocked by the proposal, as the building represented papal continuity going back to Peter. The original altar was to be preserved in the new structure that housed it. Design Bronze statue of Saint Peter by Arnolfo di Cambio, dating to the 13th century The design was a typical basilica form with the plan and elevation resembling those of Roman basilicas and audience halls, such as the Basilica Ulpia in Trajan's Forum and Constantine's own Aula Palatina at Trier, rather than the design of any Greco-Roman temple. The design may have been derived from the description of Solomon's Temple in 1 Kings 6. Constantine went to great pains to build the basilica on the site of Saint Peter's grave, and this influenced the layout of the building, which was erected on the sloped Vatican Hill, on the west bank of the Tiber River. Notably, since the site was outside the boundaries of the ancient city, the apse with the altar was located in the west so that the basilica's façade could be approached from Rome itself to the east. The exterior, unlike earlier pagan temples, was not lavishly decorated. The church was capable of housing from 3,000 to 4,000 worshipers at one time. It consisted of five aisles, a wide central nave and two smaller aisles to each side, which were each divided by 21 marble columns, taken from earlier pagan buildings. It was over long, built in the shape of a Latin cross, and had a gabled roof which was timbered on the interior and which stood at over at the center. An atrium, known as the \\"Garden of Paradise\\", stood at the entrance and had five doors which led to the body of the church; this was a sixth-century addition. The altar of Old St. Peter's Basilica used several Solomonic columns. According to tradition, Constantine took these columns from the Temple of Solomon and gave them to the church; however, the columns were probably from an Eastern church. When Gian Lorenzo Bernini built his baldacchino to cover the new St. Peter's altar, he drew from the twisted design of the old columns. Eight of the original columns were moved to the piers of the new St. Peter's.  Mosaics  The great Navicella mosaic (1305–1313) in the atrium is attributed to Giotto di Bondone. The giant mosaic, commissioned by Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi, occupied the whole wall above the entrance arcade facing the courtyard. It depicted St. Peter walking on the waters. This extraordinary work was mainly destroyed during the construction of the new St. Peter's in the 16th century, but fragments were preserved. Navicella means \\"little ship\\" referring to the large boat which dominated the scene, and whose sail, filled by the storm, loomed over the horizon. Such a natural representation of a seascape was known only from ancient works of art. The nave ended with an arch, which held a mosaic of Constantine and Saint Peter, who presented a model of the church to Christ. On the walls, each having 11 windows, were frescoes of various people and scenes from both the Old and New Testament.\\"Old Saint Peter's Basilica.\\" Encyclopædia Britannica. 2006. According to combined statements by Ghiberti and Vasari, Giotto painted five frescoes of the life of Christ and various other panels, some of which Vasari said were \\"either destroyed or carried away from the old structure of St. Peter's during the building of the new walls.\\" The fragment of an eighth-century mosaic, the Epiphany, is one of the very rare remaining bits of the medieval decoration of Old St. Peter's Basilica. The precious fragment is kept in the sacristy of Santa Maria in Cosmedin. It proves the high artistic quality of the destroyed mosaics. Another one, a standing madonna, is on a side altar in the Basilica of San Marco in Florence.

Since the crucifixion and burial of Saint Peter in 64 A.D., the spot was thought to be the location of the tomb of Saint Peter, where there stood a small shrine. With its increasing prestige the church became richly decorated with statues, furnishings and elaborate chandeliers, and side tombs and altars were continuously added. The structure was filled with tombs and bodies of saints and popes. Bones continued to be found in construction as late as February 1544. The majority of these tombs were destroyed during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries demolition of Old St. Peter's Basilica (save one which was destroyed during the Saracen Sack of the church in 846). The remainder were translated in part to modern St. Peter's Basilica, which stands on the site of the original basilica, and a handful of other churches of Rome. Along with the repeated translations from the ancient Catacombs of Rome and two fourteenth century fires in the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, the rebuilding of St. Peter's is responsible for the destruction of approximately half of all papal tombs. As a result, Donato Bramante, the chief architect of modern St. Peter's Basilica, has been remembered as \\"Maestro Ruinante\\". Stefaneschi Triptych The Stefaneschi Altarpiece is a triptych by the Italian medieval painter Giotto, commissioned by Cardinal Giacomo Gaetani StefaneschiHis name is also often found as Jacopo Caetani degli Stefaneschi. to serve as an altarpiece for one of the altars of Old St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. It is a rare example in Giotto's work of a documented commission, and includes Giotto's signature, although the date, like most dates for Giotto, is disputed, and many scholars feel the artist's workshop was responsible for its execution.Gardner, 57-8, gives the documentation from the obituary book of St. Peter's. Most scholars date the altarpiece to c. 1320; Gardner dates it to c. 1300; Anne Mueller von den Haegen dates it to c. 1313; Kessler dates it to between 1313 and 1320. It had long been thought to have been made for the main altar of the church; more recent research suggests that it was placed on the \\"canon's altar\\", located in the nave, just to the left of the huge arched opening into the transept.Kempers and De Blaauw, 88-89; Kessler, 91-92.

The river and tributaries are important sources of water supply not only for the state itself but also for neighbouring Singapore. Syarikat Air Johor, SAJ (or Johor Water Company) and the Public Utilities Board of Singapore (PUB) each draws about 250,000 cubic metres/day of water from the Johor River near Kota Tinggi. Both water supply schemes have been operational since the mid-1960s. In addition, the Linggui Dam completed and impounded in 1993 also supplements the water supply to both Johor and Singapore. Wildlife Evidence of the presence of a viable breeding population of dugongs in the waters of the Johor River estuary was collected between 1974 and 1989.

A number of his male and female models were also painted by Eugène Delacroix, with whom he was friends. Biography Durieu was born in Nîmes, and became known for making studies of nudes for Delacroix. During his career Durieu was a lawyer. His last job was inspector for education and culture. In 1849 he went into early retirement and devoted himself to the newly developing technology of photography. In 1853, Durieu worked with Delacroix on a series of photographs of different male and female nude models. On 15 November 1854, Henri Victor Regnault founded the French Société française de photographie (SFP), one of the earliest photographic societies in the world, and was its president. Regnault wanted to see notable individuals with strong scientific expertise in fields such as chemistry, physics, optics, photographic techniques in positions of the association, on the basis that the scientific component is an important aspect of photography. Between 1854 and 1855, Durieu played a key role in the organisation of the association; and other notables involved included Olympe Aguado, Hippolyte Bayard, Alexandre Edmond Becquerel, , Jean-Baptiste Louis Gros, and Gustave Le Gray. Durieu resigned in 1856, after a case of forged documents. Durieu died in Paris in 1874. Collections and exhibitions Durieu's works are found or have been exhibited in a number of galleries, including: * Getty Center - 2007-2008 Exhibition * Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York * Musée d'Orsay, Paris * Museum of Modern Art, the San Francisco * National Gallery of Art, Washington References * Coke, Van Deren. \\"Two Delacroix Drawings Made from Photographs\\".

It folded in 1848. History Formation The first local rival of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the New Board emerged in 1835 among the rough and tumble conditions of the very speculative curb-side trading during the down- turn in the market in general.Sloane, Leonard 1980 The Anatomy of the Floor, Doubleday: Garden City, New York, p. 22. The \\"curb\\" or \\"outside\\" trading the exchange used was a system in which \\"brokers and dealers traded directly with each other in the street near the exchange.\\" This board grew out of a failed attempt of these brokers to work with the Wall Street board. Bloomberg writes that it formed \\"in response to an economic boom and the formation of the first railroad corporations.\\" According to historian Robert Sobel, the New Board was the first of a number of alternative set-ups that occurred in New York trading during periods of high volume, succeeding at first, setting up rival organizations and then succumbing during ensuing less bullish times. Boom and decline At first, the new organization was very successful, growing, while Wall Street was in a general decline. To compete, the NYSE quickly began offering a second daily opportunity to buy or sell securities. After its immediate success and strong rivalry, it declined, with most members going bankrupt within three years of its founding. Nevertheless, it remained larger than the older board until 1845. The New Board's brokers were \\"crushed\\" by the Panic of 1837 and the recession that followed. The exchange then faded before folding in 1848.

Powers stepped it up in 2001, running sixteen races. On the downside, his team was low-budget and struggled throughout the entire season. However, he did have a best finish of 16th at Chicago Motor and had two other top-20 finishes: at Nashville and Kentucky. Powers' main problem was finishing races. His team only finished half of the races they started, leading the team to 21st in 2001 points. Powers' team still ran on a limited schedule and budget in 2002, only managing to make ten starts.

He played left tackle at the University of Notre Dame in the early 1900s. He is often identified in official university histories as the team's head coach for the 1902–1903 season. This claim remains controversial among sports historians, some of whom assign this honor to Farragher's teammate, All-American Louis \\"Red\\" Salmon, who served as team captain during the 1902–1903 season.Sperber (1993), p. 29. Both men are routinely credited as acting coaches in official histories of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team. Early years Farragher was born in Youngstown, Ohio, a steel-production center near the Pennsylvania border. He was raised in the working-class district of Brier Hill, on the city's near west side, and his family belonged to St. Ann's Roman Catholic Church. One brother, Mike Farragher, gained a reputation as a bare-knuckle boxer. Little else is known about James Farragher's years in Ohio. Before arriving at Notre Dame, Farragher played for a number of other college teams, including Nebraska, Duquesne, and West Virginia. During his stint with the Nebraska Cornhuskers, he played under coach Fielding H. Yost. At some point, he lost an eye as a result of an athletic injury.Executive Journal, vol. xviii, no. 9, p. 16. Notre Dame Farragher, despite his disability, proved a standout on Notre Dame's football team and was widely praised for his versatility. In 1901, the Notre Dame Scholastic observed that Farragher \\"made possible many gains for our backs by his ready way of opening up a hole in the line\\".Notre Dame Scholastic, South Bend, Indiana, December 14, 1901 The yearbook added: \\"Farragher was one of the mainstays of the team both on offensive and defensive work. In his position as tackle he has but few equals in the West. Jim rarely failed to gain when given the ball, and was a hard man to down when once started\\". When his career on the gridiron ended, he remained in South Bend, Indiana, where he became a popular campus police officer. While it remains unclear whether Farragher ever served as head coach of the Notre Dame football team, his name began to appear in official school histories in the 1930s. Controversy Chroniclers of Notre Dame sports history disagree on the validity of this claim. One skeptical observer, Murray Sperber, author of Shake Down the Thunder, speculates: \\"...when N.D. publicists began compiling the history of Notre Dame football, no one could ascertain who had coached in 1902 and 1903. Because Farragher had played on the team at the turn of the century and was a popular police officer on the Notre Dame campus in the 1930s, the publicists inscribed his name on one of the most prestigious lists in American sports–head football coach at Notre Dame\\".Sperber (1993), pp. 28-29. Despite questions surrounding Farragher's status as coach, he was evidently a major participant in one of Notre Dame football's early \\"golden ages\\". As Sperber's text notes: \\"After the mediocre 1905 season–5–4 including bad losses to the in-state rivals–the Notre Dame Scholastic announced: 'The time has come when Notre Dame should take her rank in the old football world. The rank she had when Fortin and Farragher and Farley were playing here; the rank she had when Salmon, the invincible, tore through the opposition'\\". James Farragher spent his last years in South Bend. He died in Youngstown, Ohio, on February 22, 1949, at the age of 75, after a three-month illness.

In April 1967, they were invited to show at the Pitti Palace in Florence. Rosita told the models to remove their bras, supposedly because they were the wrong color, and showed through the thin lamé blouses. The material became transparent under the lights and caused a sensation. The Missonis were not invited back the following year, but the business grew; a new factory in Sumirago was built in 1969. Missoni designs were championed in the US by Diana Vreeland, editor of American Vogue, and a Missoni boutique was opened in Bloomingdales. Missoni reached the peak of its influence in the fashion world in the early 1970s (though has since been the subject of revivals in interest as new generations of fashion writers discovered the appeal of its core knitwear). Tai Missoni then became more interested in other projects, designing costumes for La Scala, carpets and tapestries. Rosita Missoni lost interest in fashion in the 1990s and was succeeded by her daughter Angela in 1998 while Rosita took over Missoni Home. On 13 September 2011, Missoni made headlines briefly when Target Stores offered low-cost variants of Missoni products in their stores and on their website. Most items sold out within 24 hours, there were long queues outside stores and the Target website was overloaded. Some items appeared at higher prices on eBay within hours and Target did not restock.Sandra M. Jones (13 September 2011). Target hits it big with Missoni collection: Demand dries up 6-week supply in 1 day. Chicago Tribune. Accessed May 2014. In February 2014, Angela Missoni hired Rossella Jardini, former creative director of Moschino, as a consultant. In 2017, Jennifer Lopez teamed up with Missoni along with Women's Cancer Research Fund and Saks Fifth Avenue to set a fund raise for cancer research. Lopez will help promote the $35 limited-edition Missoni tees, and the profits will go to 12 different cancer charities. Brands A Missoni coat and dress in 2010 Pellegrino mineral water bottle with a Missoni-style label, 2010 Missoni brands include Missoni Sport, which was initially licensed out, brought in- house in January 2002, and is now discontinued; and M Missoni, a less expensive line introduced in 1998, manufactured and distributed by Marzotto. Margherita Maccapani Missoni, granddaughter of Rosita Missoni, is the creative director of M Missoni. Missoni Home has its roots in furnishing fabrics produced in 1981 in collaboration with Rosita's family firm. They launched their first perfume in 1982, although the license is now held by Estée Lauder. In November 2005, Missoni and the Rezidor Hotel Group signed an agreement to create Hotel Missoni, with plans to have 30 hotels open or in development by 2012. Their Edinburgh hotel has been rebranded as Radisson Collection Edinburgh. The hotel agreement ceased in 2014. In 2017, Missoni Baia, Missoni's first venture into residential real estate development, broke ground in Miami, Florida. The 249 unit complex will be completed by the end of 2020. Family In 1996 the Missonis transferred control of the business to their three children: Vittorio Missoni became marketing director; Luca (born 1956) was menswear designer until 2008; Angela (born 1958) was womenswear designer, and took over menswear in 2008 when Luca became responsible for the Archive and Events. Margherita Missoni used to both design accessories and model for Missoni as well. Today she runs her own line of children's clothing, which is not associated with Missoni SpA. Death of Vittorio Missoni On 4 January 2013 a plane carrying Vittorio Missoni, then CEO of Missoni, went missing off the coast of Venezuela. On 27 June 2013, the Venezuelan government announced that remains of the aircraft had been found north of Los Roques archipelago. Vittorio's body was recovered along with those of the other passengers.

The name \\"whistling tarantula\\" comes from its ability to produce a hissing noise when provoked, a trait it shares with other Australian theraphosids. This hissing is produced by the spider stridulating a patch of setae associated with its chelicerae. It has also been called the \\"eastern tarantula\\".Townsville Bulletin: Spider invasion in Bowen The species name crassipes is Latin for \\"fat leg\\" referring to the relatively fat front legs. Selenocosmia crassipes can attain legspans of up to . Its body length, from eyes to the rear of its abdomen, measures between , making it the largest Australian tarantula. Description The thick footed tarantula has powerful long venomous fangs that can grow up to long. Its body is with a leg span of or larger than the size of man's hand. Identification is relatively simple as this very large spider has thicker front legs than back legs. It is recognized as the largest spider in Australia. Due to the hissing sound the spider makes when approached, it has acquired the nickname \\"barking spider\\", sometimes “hissing spider”.Times Online: Giant spiders invade Australian Outback townBrisbane Times: Web of lies: UK press plays up spider 'invasion' This species is quite shy and normally does not wander far from its burrow.News.com.au: Giant bird- eating spiders invade town Females live up to thirty years, males up to eight years.SkyNews: Tarantulas Spin Web Of Terror In Oz Town Venom The bite from an Eastern tarantula is not fatal to a human, but can cause up to six hours of vomiting. The venom can cause death to a dog or cat within thirty minutes.Queensland Museum (2000), p. 40. In May 2010 a scientist living near Cooktown, Queensland, was bitten on her right index finger and experienced symptoms never reported before in research literature. The finger became swollen and very sensitive to touch within one hour. \\"The pain was so intense that sleep that night was impossible. Fifteen hours post-bite, the adjoining finger and upper hand were also swollen and painful.\\" The pain and swelling were limited to the hand and lower arm only (and not systemic as previously reported) and she reported that they had both eased after 26 hours. Photos were taken at various stages of the swelling.Raven and Covacevich (2012), pp. 19-22. Food Despite the sometimes used common names bird-eating spider and bird spider, this nocturnal ground dwelling species is not likely to ever encounter or feed on birds. These spiders predominately feed upon invertebrates including insects and other spiders. Small vertebrates such as geckos, skinks and frogs are also part of the diet. Taxonomy Selenocosmia crassipes was first described by Ludwig Koch in 1874, as Phrictus crassipes. It was subsequently transferred to Phlogius by Simon in 1887 and then to Selenocosmia by the Australian arachnologist Barbara York Main in 1982. In 1995, Günter Schmidt transferred the species back to the genus Phlogius. This transfer is not accepted by the World Spider Catalog, which does not recognize the genus Phlogius. Distribution and habitat Selenocosmia crassipes is found throughout North Queensland and is a burrowing arachnid, living underground in burrows, which can be up to deep, but might be forced into the open during periods of heavy rain. Young spiders find natural burrows under rocks or roots. Adults expand their burrows up to lined with silk with a tunnel off the main tunnel going upwards to a chamber with an air pocket sufficient to last a few days. It lives in rainforests and gullies or other sheltered cooler spots in open forests along the Queensland Central coast. It is also found in and around gardens or other plant life. As a pet Selenocosmia crassipes is a fast-growing spider and widely sought after as a pet. It is harvested from the wild, often illegally, a threat to its natural population.

The most famous monk of his time, he is also known as (\\"national Zen teacher\\"), an honorific conferred on him by Emperor Go-Daigo.Musō Soseki, Kyoto University His mother was the daughter of Hōjō Masamura (1264-1268), seventh Shikken (regent) of the Kamakura shogunate. Biography Originally from Ise Province, now part of modern-day Mie Prefecture, Soseki was a ninth-generation descendant of Emperor Uda.Papinot (1972:602) At the age of four he lost his mother and was therefore put in the temple of Hirashioyama under the guidance of priest Kūa. He entered a mountain temple in 1283, where he studied the Shingon and Tendai sects of Buddhism. In 1292 he took his vows at Tōdai-ji in Nara, and was given the name Chikaku. In 1293 he dreamed that, while visiting two temples in China called in Japanese and he was given a portrait of Daruma Daishi (the introductor of Chan Buddhism in China, commonly called Zen Buddhism in English) and told to keep it safe. When he awoke, he concluded that Zen must be his destiny, so he converted and went to study Zen at Kennin-ji Temple in Kyoto under , , and others. For the most part, however, he practiced alone. Kennichi confirmed Soseki's enlightenment after a period of time.Kirchner, Thomas Yuho, and Shizuteru Ueda 上田閑照. Entangling Vines : Zen Koans of the Shumon Kattoshu 宗門葛藤集. Saga Tenryuji (Japan): Tenryu-ji Institute for Philosophy and Religion, 2004, pp. 184–185. Later, in remembrance of the dream, he composed a new name for himself, forming his family name from characters meaning dream and window, and his given name from the first characters of the names of the two temples appearing in his dream; it was this new name, Musō Soseki, by which he was to become famous.Reikizan Tenryū-ji. Retrieved February 8, 2009. In 1325 Emperor Go- Daigo requested that he come to Kyoto to become head priest of the great temple of Nanzen-ji. The following year he founded Zen'o-ji in his native Ise He was later invited by Kamakura's regent Hōjō Takatoki so, the following year, after establishing a temple in Ise province he went to Kamakura and stayed at Jōchi-ji and Engaku-ji. In 1327 with Nikaidō Dōun's support he founded Zuisen-ji, a temple destined to become an important cultural center in the region. Afterwards, he stayed at Kyūkō-ji in Kōchi Prefecture. He acquired creeds from both Hōjō Takatoki and Hōjō Sadaaki. After the fall of the Kamakura shogunate, he was ordered by the Emperor Go-Daigo to go back to Kyoto, where he founded Saihō-ji and Rinkawa-dera. It was in this period that he was given by imperial decree the name Musō Kokushi. In 1345 of Muromachi period, he founded Tenryū-ji in Kyoto, that is his most important work. After that, six years passed, and he died. Musō Soseki and the Ashikaga After Go-Daigo's Kenmu Restoration failed and Ashikaga Takauji became shōgun, like many other men of his time Soseki switched sides. He was ambitious and sensitive to power shifts, so he allied himself with the Ashikaga brothers, becoming their intimate and serving them well.Sansom (1977:101–102 He stayed with them for the rest of his long life, enjoying the support of both the shōgun and his brother Tadayoshi, who played a pivotal role in his career. Musō helped the two Ashikaga organize a network of Zen monasteries, the so- called Five Mountain System, and its subsidiary, the Ankoku-ji network of temples, across Japan. This helped create a national religious movement and solidify the shōgun's power. In 1339, at Go-Daigo's death he opened Tenryū-ji in Kyoto to ensure the Emperor a prosperous afterlife. The garden in front of the chief abbot's residence is one of his works, incorporating elements of the landscape in Arashiyama near Kyoto. It is considered evidence of his genius as a landscape designer. Musō, together with Ashikaga Tadayoshi and a merchant named Shihon are considered responsible for the reopening of trade between Japan and China.Collcutt, Martin.

Cambridge, Mass. : Published by Council on East Asian Studies, Harvard University : Distributed by Harvard University Press. As a result of the trading mission, the construction of Tenryū-ji was completed. The Kyoto Five Mountain Zen temple network was being established.  Musō Soseki's intellectual legacy  The temples of the Five Mountain System network of Zen temples were centers of learning of Confucian metaphysics, Chinese poetry, painting, calligraphy, printing, architecture, garden design, and ceramics,Dumoulin (2005:310) and as such have left an indelible mark on the country's history and culture. At the very center of their birth stands Musō Soseki. Soseki was an abbot at Zenrin-ji, Tenryū-ji, Zuisen-ji and many other temples. He taught Zen to a great number of disciples (the estimated number is over 10 thousand), also leaving an enormous body of poetry and other writings. One of his best known zen teachings is . Among his students are Gidō Shūshin and Zekkai Chūshin, literary figures who had a central role in the development of the Japanese Literature of the Five Mountains. Even though none survives in its original form, Soseki's Zen gardens have proven to be one of his most lasting contributions to the country's culture and image. To Soseki designing new gardens and altering existing ones was an integral part of the practice of Zen.Johnson (1993:214) Soseki died in 1351 at the age of 77.

The railroad is co-owned by KBN Incorporated and Independent Locomotive Service and is headquartered in Crookston, Minnesota. As of 2006, the Minnesota Northern Railroad employed 11 people and handled approximately 11,000 carloads per year. The primary commodities hauled included grain, seeds, sugar and sugar by-products, coal, animal feeds, and fertilizers. The Minnesota Northern Railroad interchanges with the BNSF Railway, the Canadian Pacific Railway, and the Northern Plains Railroad. History The Minnesota Northern Railroad was created in December 1996 when the railroad’s former owner, RailAmerica, purchased of track from the newly created Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway. Also included in the sale were of trackage rights on the BNSF's Grand Forks Subdivision from Crookston, Minnesota to Erskine, Minnesota and the Canadian Pacific's Detroit Lakes Subdivision from Erskine, Minnesota to Thief River Falls, Minnesota. The of track initially sold to the Minnesota Northern Railroad consisted of: * A portion of the P Line Subdivision from Perley, Minnesota to Crookston, Minnesota * The Fertile Subdivision from Crookston, Minnesota to Fertile, Minnesota * The Ada Subdivision from Crookston, Minnesota to Ada, Minnesota * The Warroad Subdivision from St. Hilaire, Minnesota to Warroad, Minnesota * A spur of the Grand Forks Subdivision from Tilden Junction, Minnesota to Red Lake Falls, Minnesota. Shortly after the Minnesota Northern Railroad acquired its track, it abandoned the dilapidated Fertile Subdivision and most of the spur from Tilden Junction to Red Lake Falls. In addition, it acquired approximately of trackage rights over the BNSF Railway near Erskine, Minnesota. Later abandonments would include the portion of the Ada Subdivision from Beltrami, Minnesota to Ada, Minnesota, the portion of the P Line Subdivision from Shelly, Minnesota to Perley, Minnesota, and the portion of the Warroad Subdivision from Roseau, Minnesota to Warroad, Minnesota. Prior to coming under the control of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, the of track initially purchased by the Minnesota Northern Railroad belonged to the Burlington Northern Railroad. Before being owned by the Burlington Northern Railroad, the P Line, Ada, and Warroad Subdivisions were owned by the Great Northern Railway. The Fertile Subdivision and spur from Tilden Junction to Red Lake Falls, meanwhile, had been owned by the Northern Pacific Railway. The portion of the Fertile Subdivision sold to the Minnesota Northern Railroad was once a part of the Northern Pacific Railway’s mainline from Hawley, Minnesota to Winnipeg, Manitoba. Though the line was an important route for passenger and freight trains to and from Winnipeg in its heyday, currently only a few portions have been spared from abandonment. A segment of the abandoned grade between Crookston, Minnesota in the north and Ulen, Minnesota in the south has been converted to a multi-use trail known as the Agassiz Recreational Trail Ownership of the Minnesota Northern Railroad was turned over from RailAmerica to KBN Incorporated and Independent Locomotive Service in 2001. Both companies are based in Minnesota and also co-own two other short line railroads: the St. Croix Valley Railroad in eastern Minnesota and the Dakota Northern Railroad in eastern North Dakota. Locomotive and Freight Car Fleet Minnesota Northern Railroad co-owner Independent Locomotive Service supplies the railroad with a fleet of various locomotives, primarily rebuilt four-axle \\"general purpose\\" locomotives and switchers from EMD. The locomotives are sent from an Independent Locomotive Service shop in either Bethel, Minnesota or Holt, Minnesota. The majority of the Minnesota Northern Railroad’s locomotives contain maroon paint with gold lettering. The colors are reminiscent of the school colors used at the University of Minnesota. Besides possessing locomotives, the Minnesota Northern Railroad also leases 80 covered hoppers.

The total area drained by the Nan and its tributaries is . Much of the lower basin has perfect soil for farming. Nan Basin Most drainage analyses, however, divide the Greater Nan Basin into the Nan Basin and the Yom River Basin. Using this convention, and subtracting the of land drained by the Yom and its tributaries, the Nan basin drains a total of of land in the provinces of Phitsanulok, Phichit, Nan and Uttaradit. History Early civilizations Ancient civilizations lived in the fertile land along the Nan River and its tributaries, as is evidenced by Stone Age tools unearthed near Phitsanulok. However, these early hunter-gatherers are not likely to be ancestors of the Tai who presently inhabit the Nan basin. The human population around the Chao Phraya River and its tributaries, such as the Nan, remained sparse until late in the region’s history. A History of Thailand The settlement of the indigenous populations of the region began around the advent of rice agriculture during the Bronze Age, and continued through the Iron Age. Archaeologists suspect that Mon–Khmer speaking tribes spread through the region, bringing rice agriculture, metalworking, domestic animals. The main course of migration during the metal ages probably ran along the coast of Thailand, but migrants also travelled inland along the Chao Phraya to the Nan Basin and other areas, where it was relatively easier to establish settlements. The next major wave of migration into the Nan Basin came not from the coast along the Chao Phraya, but rather from the mountainous areas of northern Thailand. These migrants were the Tai. Their course of immigration probably began south of the Yangzi River. As the Han Chinese spread south of the Yangzi around the sixth century BC, the ancestors of the Thai retreated into the high valleys and, over many centuries, migrated west along an arc from the Guangxi to the Brahmaputra Valley. The Thai brought rice-farming expertise to the mountainous areas of Northern Thailand, and eventually to the Nan Basin and the other lowland regions of Thailand. Some of the Nan River Mon-Khmer retreated into the hills as the Thai expansion continued, while others generally adopted dialects of the Tai language and blended into the culture of the new settlers. The Tai language spoken in the area was heavily influenced by the Khmer culture as well, and evolved into the language we now call Thai, which is considerably different from other Tai dialects. Even after this Thai migration, the population in the Nan Basin, other than along the banks of the Nan River and its major tributaries, was sparse. predator animal species, as well as malaria, tropical temperatures and other hardships, kept the population from expanding far from the river, despite the region's extremely fertile soil. As the population grew during these ancient times, settlements along the Nan eventually became more urban, as populations of larger scale were better able to survive the hardships of the heavily forested region. The earliest urban developments along the Nan were modelled after the Mon-Khmer capital at Angkor in Cambodia, which was already quite advanced by the time the Nan Basin had significant population to support urban settlement. Along with the positive effects of urbanization (e.g., development of art and specialization of labor), however, came slavery, war and other societal problems associated with urban culture in the forecoming city-state period. Even in spite of urbanization along the river banks, most of the Nan Basin (aside from the river-side settlements) consisted of virgin forests until around the turn of the 20th century. One of the early river-side urban areas of the Nan emerging during the era of the Khmer Empire was Song Khwae, which over the years developed into the modern city of Phitsanulok. Houseboats River houses in Phitsanulok Phitsanulok is the only place in Thailand where houseboats are legal, as they have been an important aspect of regional culture since long before the drafting of modern municipal law. People of Phitsanulok still gather on houseboats and raft houses along both sides of the Nan River in the city, and adhere to a traditional way of life.Phitsanulok on ThaiWebsites.com There is even a floating houseboat museum along the Nan in Phitsanulok, which allows tourists to experience the Nan houseboat culture first-hand.

Pultenaea is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae-Faboideae that are native to Australia. They are known commonly as bush peas. The genus is found in south west Western Australia and the eastern states. It is not considered to be monophyletic with suggestions of splitting it into six separate subgenera, under a larger genus of Pultenaea sensu lato, which would include 19 out of 25 genera included in the former tribe Mirbelieae. The genus underwent explosive starburst radiation, with biogeographical divisions due to the Nullarbor Plain and the winter/summer rainfall boundary. Some species rely on fire regimes for germination, and are an understorey dominant and nitrogen fixer. Taxonomy and Phylogeny The genus was first formally described by botanist James Edward Smith in 1794 in A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland, with Pultenaea stipularis nominated as the type species. The latter was described from a living specimen which was raised in Stockwell, England from seed obtained from New South Wales in 1792. Smith named the genus in honour of Richard Pulteney, an English surgeon and botanist, who also was the biographer of Linnaeus. Phylogeny Pultenaea belongs to the Mirbelioid clade of the legume subfamily Faboideae. Pultenaea is paraphyletic with respect to several of the other mirbelioid genera. Molecular phylogenetics supports 7 clades within the current circumscription of Pultenaea: * Western Australia  Pultenaea quaerita clade  Pultenaea ericifolia–Pultenaea indira clade  Pultenaea skinner–Pultenaea reticulata clade  Pultenaea brachytropis (monotypic) * Eastern Australia  subgenus Chaodes  subgenus Pultenaea  subgenus Corrickosa Speciation The Mirbelioids have had long isolation in Australia from other Fabaceae families. Pultenaea Sm. underwent explosive starburst radiation during the late Miocene, due to aridity. Geographic speciation factors include east vs. west endemism due to increased aridity and the development of the Nullarbor Plain; subgenera Pultenaea and Corrickosa of eastern Australia split along the Winter–Summer rainfall boundary; subclades within Corrickosa diverged due to marine incursions between South Australia and Victoria. Western Australian species include disjunctions between north and south, and Esperance/Cape Arid. Recent extinctions, possibly due to changed fire regimes and grazing pressure, include P. elusa and P. maidenii. Species Species include: *Pultenaea daphnoides Wendl.—Large-leaf bush- pea *Pultenaea densifolia F.Muell.—Dense-leaf bush-pea *Pultenaea flexilis Sm.—Graceful bush-pea *Pultenaea gunnii Benth.—Golden bush-pea *Pultenaea juniperina Labill.—Prickly bush-pea *Pultenaea muelleri Benth.—Mueller's bush- pea *Pultenaea pauciflora M.B.

They are found in sclerophyllous vegetation types varying from forests to heath lands, but absent from arid interior and rainforest regions. Its distribution indicates that the genus is limited by water (arid regions) and sunlight/competition (tropical regions). Eastern Australia contains 87 species,while Western Australia contains 27 species. Four species are found in both regions. Ecology Pultenaea species are understorey dominants, play a role of nutrient cycling as nitrogen fixers, and are an important food source for invertebrates. Like many species of Fabaceae, hard-seeded Pultenaea species require fire for germination and recruitment e.g. P. williamsoniana. A periodic fire regime of at least ten years is needed to allow for maturity. Pultenaea species can be locally abundant, and are abundant along roadsides, possibly due to increased light or disturbance. Threats include clearance and fragmentation of habitat, inappropriate fire regimes, weed invasion, and grazing, which may have led to extinctions of P. elusa and P. maidenii Cultivation A number of species are cultivated for their spring flower display. Most of these are fast-growing and adaptable to diverse growing conditions. Propagation is from semi-mature cuttings or seed pre-treated by soaking in hot water. Three cultivars are registered with the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority: *Pultenaea pedunculata 'Pyalong Gold' *Pultenaea pedunculata 'Pyalong Pink' *Pultenaea villosa 'Wallum Gold'—a prostrate form References Fabales of Australia Mirbelioids ","title":"Pultenaea"},{"id":"5793351","text":"Romeo Benetti (; born 20 October 1945) is a former Italian footballer, who played as a defensive midfielder. A tenacious player, Benetti played for several Italian clubs throughout his career, winning titles with A.C. Milan, Juventus and Roma. At international level, he represented the Italy national football team on 55 occasions between 1971 and 1980, and took part at the 1974 and 1978 FIFA World Cups, as well as UEFA Euro 1980, achieving fourth-place finishes in the latter two tournaments. Club career After winning the 1967–68 Serie B title with Palermo, Benetti started his Serie A career in 1968 with Juventus, making 24 appearances and scoring a goal during his first season with the club. However, he did not remain at the club for long, and he joined Sampdoria on loan during the next season. His breakthrough came in the 1970–71 Serie A season, after joining A.C. Milan in 1970, helping the club to three consecutive second-place finishes in the league between 1970 and 1973. During his time at the club, he won the 1972–73 European Cup Winners' Cup, as well as two Coppa Italia trophies during the 1971–72 and 1972–73 seasons, later being named the club's captain, inheriting the armband from teammate Gianni Rivera. He also scored a memorable long-range goal in the Milan Derby against rivals Inter in March 1973. In 1976, he returned to Juventus and won the 1976–77 and 1977–78 Serie A titles, as well as the 1976–77 UEFA Cup, and the Coppa Italia during the 1978–79 season. As his career came to an end he transferred to Roma in 1979, where he remained until 1981, winning two more consecutive Coppa Italia titles before retiring. International career Benetti won 55 caps for Italy between 1971 and 1980, scoring 2 goals throughout his international career. He made his debut on 25 September 1971 against Mexico. He was member of the Italian squads that took part in the 1974 FIFA World Cup, and also in the 1978 FIFA World Cup, where he wore the number 10 shirt as Italy finished in fourth place; Benetti scored a goal from outside the area in the first round of the tournament, in a 3–1 victory over Hungary. He also took part at the 1980 UEFA European Championship with his country, on home soil, where he helped his team to the semi-finals, eventually finishing the tournament in fourth place once again; he made his final international appearance in the third-place match, which ended in a penalty shoot-out defeat to Czechoslovakia following a 1–1 draw after extra-time, although Benetti was able to net his penalty in the shoot-out. He was voted into Italy's all-time world cup team by website PlanetWorldCup.com and its members. Style of play Nicknamed Panzer (tank), El Tigre (the tiger), and Roccia (rock), Benetti was a tenacious, mobile, athletic, and complete midfielder, who was known in particular for his physical strength, stamina, charisma, determination, consistency, and leadership as footballer, as well as the trademark moustache that he bore for most of his career. Although he was initially deployed as a winger, he usually played as a central or defensive midfielder, and his hard-tackling style of play in this role epitomised the catenaccio tactics made famous by Italy during the 1970s. Despite being a predominately defensive-minded player, he was also known for his goal-scoring ability from midfield, due to his powerful and accurate striking ability from distance. Furthermore, Benetti also possessed good technique and distribution, which enabled him to function as a deep-lying playmaker at times, and start attacking plays and create goalscoring opportunities after winning back the ball, in particular when playing in teams that lacked a true midfield playmaker. In 2007, he was voted in at number 30 in a list of Football's 50 Greatest Hardmen by The Times online. The British tabloid The Sun instead placed Benetti in their list of the ten hardest footballers ever, quoting one of his opponents, who described him as \\"a true animal, wherever you find him, he is always ready to roar.\\" Honours Club ;Juventus * Serie A: 1976–77, 1977–78 * UEFA Cup: 1976–77 * Coppa Italia: 1978–79 ;Milan * Coppa Italia: 1971–72, 1972–73 * UEFA Cup Winners Cup: 1972–73 ;Roma * Coppa Italia: 1979–80, 1980–81 ;Palermo * Serie B: 1967–68 International ;Italy * FIFA World Cup: 1978 (Fourth place) * UEFA European Championship: 1980 (Fourth place) References External links Profile and Statistics at the FIGC website 1945 births Living people Italian footballers Italy international footballers Taranto F.C. 1927 players Robur Siena players Palermo F.C. players Juventus F.C. players U.C.

His father was Miyaō Saburō, who was a resident of Sakai and was a master at playing the Japanese hand drum (tsutsumi). Circumstantial evidence indicates that Miyaō Saburō probably died around the year 1553. Shōan's mother, the wife of Miyaō Saburō, was known as Sōon. She became the second wife of Sen no Rikyū. Shōan was adopted into the Sen family and became the son-in-law of Rikyū when he married Rikyū's daughter Okame.Entry on Miyaō Saburō in Rikyū Daijiten (Japanese encyclopedia about Sen Rikyū). Tankosha, 1989. The oldest boy born between Shōan and Okame was Sen Sōtan, the third generation in the Sen family tradition of Japanese tea ceremony.URASENKE TRADITION OF TEA Shōan was the same age as Rikyū's oldest son, Sen Dōan, but his skill at Japanese tea ceremony was much more highly reputed than was Dōan's. Rikyū left the Sen estate in Sakai for Dōan, and had Shōan and family set up a new Sen household in Kyoto. The exact year of the move is unknown, but it represented the origin of the so-called Kyoto Sen Family (Kyō- Senke),Entry on Sen Shōan in Rikyū Daijiten which evolved into the present san-Senke (lit., three Sen houses/families) (see Schools of Japanese tea ceremony). Following Rikyū's seppuku (ritual suicide) by order of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the Kyoto property where Shōan and family resided was confiscated. Shōan went to Aizu Wakamatsu (present-day Fukushima Prefecture) where he lived under the protection of the warrior Gamō Ujisato. Some years later, Hideyoshi pardoned the Sen family and arranged for the restoration of the Kyoto household. Sen Dōan in Sakai, similarly, was pardoned and allowed to reestablish the Sen household in Sakai, but that household eventually died out, as Dōan had no successor. When the Kyoto Sen household was reestablished, it was decided between Hideyoshi and Shōan that Sōtan, Rikyū's blood descendant who had been living as a young Buddhist trainee at Daitoku-ji temple during this period of family upheaval, should become acting head of the family. It is believed that Shōan therefore retired early and moved to a small cottage called Shōnantei at Saihōji temple (see Kokedera), in western Kyoto.Tsutsui Hiroichi, \\"Sen Sotan,\\" in Chanoyu Quarterly no. 46 (1986) References *Daijirin, 2nd Ed. *Kōjien, 5th Ed. 1546 births 1614 deaths ","title":"Sen Shōan"},{"id":"5793362","text":"John Joseph Fina (born March 11, 1969) is a former American football offensive lineman, who spent eleven years in the National Football League, ten of those with the Buffalo Bills, and a one-year stint with the Arizona Cardinals.

It is now a country house known as Herrevad Castle (, ).  History  Herrevad Abbey was founded from Cîteaux Abbey in 1144 as Denmark's first Cistercian monastery with the support of Archbishop Eskil of Lund. Legend has it that Eskil fell ill while he was a student at Hildesheim University in Germany and was told he was near death. The Virgin Mary appeared to him in a dream and he promised her that if he was spared he would establish five monasteries from different orders. Eskil went on to become the provost of the chapter at Lund Cathedral, the Bishop of Roskilde, and succeeded his uncle, Asser Svendsen, as Archbishop of Lund, and from these important offices was able to fulfil his promise. Some Danish Benedictine monasteries had become unruly during his tenure, and the Cistercians were seen as reformers who would bring existing religious houses back to the original rigour of the Rule of St. Benedict. The original name, Herivad, meant the \\"army ford\\", referring to a ford over the Rønne River. After the construction of the abbey it became known as Herrevad, or \\"the Lord's ford\\", most likely because of the fee payable to the abbey for using the ford, and later the bridge, for commerce. Eskil wrote to Bernard of Clairvaux requesting twelve Cistercian monks from Cîteaux Abbey under the leadership of Robert, the first abbot of Herrevad, to come to Denmark to establish a new monastery. Later an additional nine lay brothers were also despatched to instruct the Danes in the crafts and agricultural practices associated with the Cistercian Order. Archbishop Eskil gave the land for the site of the abbey and paid for its construction out of his own pocket. It was built near the village of Lyngbyhed, now Ljungbyhed, on the above- mentioned ford, which was of importance because of its position on the main road between Sweden and Denmark, and the resulting access to markets in both. The abbey was consecrated in 1150, though it was far from complete; the original dedication was probably to the Blessed Virgin Mary (). The church was begun in 1158 and built in the Romanesque style out of sandstone. Construction extended over several decades and for reasons of expense was continued in brick. The original monastery complex was severely damaged by a fire in 1291. The original sandstone was ruined by the heat of the fire, and so a new and larger Brick Gothic church was begun, second in size only to Lund Cathedral itself. It was 53 meters long, with two naves, one 19 meters wide and the other 28 meters wide. The abbey precinct consisted of the large church and three ranges which served as a dormitory, a refectory and cellars, a range for the housing of the lay brothers who did the farm work and administered to the abbey's temporal affairs, and a small library and scriptorium where religious texts were copied. Though there is some dispute, some scholars believe the Codex Runicus, a medieval attempt to use runes for writing the Law of Skåne (), was produced there. Herrevad Abbey over time became one of the largest and wealthiest monastic houses in Denmark, and certainly in Skåne, then part of Denmark. At its height, the abbey owned more than 400 income-producing properties. It enjoyed the support of the nobility and Denmark's royal family for generations. Herrevad established three daughter houses in Denmark - Holme Abbey, Tvis Abbey and Løgum Abbey - as well as several in Sweden.  Dissolution  A depiction of the estate in 1680 In 1513 the final addition to the abbey church was completed when the choir was expanded. The Cistercian commitment to hard work and good land use practices resulted in the abbey being of great value to the crown. In 1536 during the Protestant Reformation Denmark became a Lutheran kingdom, and all religious houses and their property fell to the crown. In an unusual move the abbey with its farms was secularized but went on functioning much as it had as a monastery. The monks and lay brothers were permitted to remain until the site was turned over to the crown in 1565 by Abbot Laurids, whose tombstone has been preserved inside the chapel at Herrevad Castle. The date of his death, 30 October 1572, is certainly among the latest of surviving heads of any religious house in Skåne. The abbey school continued to function until 1575. The abbey church continued to hold Lutheran services until 1585 when it was determined that the church was superfluous. Herrevad was given to Sten Bille, a prominent nobleman, and his wife for their lifetimes. Bille was the uncle of Tycho Brahe and after Brahe's studies abroad suggested that he live at Herrevad. Bille paid for the construction of a laboratory in one of the old monastery buildings for Brahe to use. He used the laboratory to invent an improvement for the manufacture of paper. By 1570 Brahe was producing paper in Scandinavia for the first time at the Klippan Mill near Herrevad. At his request a glassworks was also constructed at Herrevad, the first in the country. Tycho Brahe became a world- famous astronomer at Herrevad when on the night of 11 November 1572 he recorded a new star \\"brighter than Venus\\" located in the constellation Cassiopeia. He called others to witness it and gave it the name \\"Stella Nova\\", the new star. With a sextant he constructed himself, he studied and recorded what is now called a supernova, for almost an entire year. Brahe published his findings at Copenhagen in 1573 and these became the basis for his fame as an astronomer. He later moved onto the island of Hven in the Sound and built Montebello Observatory and manor house. Herrevad passed to several other nobles until 1658 when Skåne was united with Sweden. Herrevad was then given to the Swedish Count Corfitz Ulfeldt and afterwards passed to several other Swedish nobles, but eventually reverted to the Swedish crown. The abbey was sacked by the Danish army in the wars between Denmark and Sweden in 1709-1710. Karl XI of Sweden ordered the ruined abbey buildings to be demolished and the materials transported to Malmö to build his German Church. The only existing remnant of the abbey is part of the old sacristy of the church which was used as a shed.  Later history  Herrevad was put at the disposal of the Northern Skåne Cavalry Regiment in 1691 after the demolition of the monastery complex. By 1727 a new building for the regimental headquarters had been raised from building materials left over from the demolition of the abbey. It later became a residence for the commander, but retained the name Herrevad Abbey. In 1745 the residence was expanded and nicknamed \\"Herrevad Castle\\" () by the soldiers. Two wings were added in 1816-1819 in the Empire style, and the name Herrevad Castle formally adopted. The buildings were used by various military units until 1994 when Herrevad Castle passed into private ownership. It is currently undergoing restoration. In the 1980s an excavation located the foundations of the choir and parts of the nave, which may still be seen.

Biography  His birth name was Sannosuke Dōmoto. At a young age, he started working for Heizo Tatsumura I. At the age of 28, he was exhibited with his work \\"Landscape of Fukakusa\\". His 1961 \\"Symphony\\" is considered one of his most famous paintings. Dōmoto painted 600 interior screens and ceilings for Buddhist temples and shrines, amongst them Tōfuku-ji in Kyoto's Higashiyama district. In 1933 he painted the large and vivid \\"Blue Dragon\\" ceiling painting for one of the halls. He painted it in 17 days. He received a commission from the monastery Chishaku-in, that has a garden said to be a favourite of Sen no Rikyū, to paint new sliding doors facing it. \\"Ladies at Tea\\" from 1958 shows a more western-style painting of two women enjoying tea. The left side is a woman in kimono, while the lady to the right is in western dress. The four sliding doors were a departure from the traditional style. Dōmoto received a commission from the temple Hōnen-in for two rooms. Normally the rooms had paintings by the Kano school. Two rooms that he painted in 1971 \\"Soft breeze approaching\\" depict the Pure Land. An abstract painting, it shows willows or trees swaying in the wind. He also designed furoshiki fabrics. Initially they were of designs that did not use much colour, but as the colour dying techniques evolved, towards the end of his life he designed more colourful designs.  School  When he was 45 years old, he established a painting school which still exists today. One of the teachers there is Nihonga painter Masaki Ukai. The Inshō Dōmoto Art Museum in Kyoto is dedicated to his work and regularly holds exhibitions about him and other painters.  Awards  He was made an Imperial Household Artist in 1944 and received the Order of Culture in 1961.

He worked with Eddie Condon, Art Hodes, Gene Krupa, Benny Goodman, Jack Teagarden, Tommy Dorsey, often leading his own bands. He was married to pianist Marian McPartland. Music career Austin High School Gang McPartland was born in Chicago, Illinois. His father was a music teacher and baseball player. He and his siblings for some time lived in orphanages. After being removed from one orphanage for fighting, he got in further trouble with the law. He credited music with turning him around; he started violin at age 5, and took up the cornet at age 15. McPartland was a member of the Austin High School Gang with Bud Freeman (tenor sax), Frank Teschemacher (clarinet), his brother Dick McPartland (banjo/guitar), brother-in-law Jim Lanigan (bass, tuba and violin), Joe Sullivan (piano), and Dave Tough (drums) in the 1920s. They were inspired by the recordings they heard at the local malt shop, the Spoon and Straw. They studied and tried to duplicate what they heard on recordings by the New Orleans Rhythm Kings and others, and would frequently visit Louis Armstrong, who was a few years their senior, and King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band. New York City bands After playing through high school, their first musical job was under the name the Blue Friars. In 1924, at age 17, McPartland went to New York City to take Bix Beiderbecke's place in the Wolverines band. Beiderbecke sat at the back of the club during the audition. They became friends and roomed together. At that time, Beiderbecke picked out the cornet for McPartland that he played throughout his career. From 1926 to 1927, McPartland worked with Art Kassel. Also in 1927, he was a part of the McKenzie-Condon's Chicagoans recording session that produced \\"China Boy\\" and \\"Nobody's Sweetheart\\". Finally, in 1927 he joined Ben Pollack's band for two years, and was one of the main soloists (with Benny Goodman, Bud Freeman, Jack Teagarden and Glenn Miller). McPartland played on the 1928 recording of \\"Room 1411\\". He also moonlighted in Broadway pit bands. McPartland then went to New York City, and played with a number of small combos. He co-wrote the song \\"Makin' Friends\\" with Jack Teagarden. In 1930, McPartland moved back to Chicago, working with his brother Dick, in a group called the Embassy Four. He was then a bandleader, singer, and master-of-ceremonies at the Three Deuces nightclub. He worked with Russ Columbo (1931–1932) and the Harry Reser band (1933–1935). During this period, he married singer Dorothy Williams, who along with her sister Hannah (who later married boxer Jack Dempsey), performed as the Williams Sisters, and they had a daughter, Dorothy. They soon divorced and McPartland spent time in South America. Meeting Marian During 1936–1941, McPartland led his own bands and joined Teagarden's Big Band until he was drafted into the army during World War II (1942–1944). After participating in the invasion of Normandy, he met his future wife in Belgium, the English pianist Margaret Marian Turner, who became better known as jazz pianist Marian McPartland. They married in Aachen, Germany and moved back to Chicago, where McPartland appeared on Windy City Jamboree before settling in New York City. Soon, he was part of the Willie 'The Lion' Smith band with Jimmy Archey, Pee Wee Russell, George 'Pops' Foster, and George Wettling. The band won a Grammy Award for the soundtrack to the 1954 film After Hours. McPartland encouraged Marian her to develop her own style and form her own group, which led to the establishment of her long residency at the Hickory House with a trio including drummer Joe Morello. In 1948 he and Marian performed at the Brass Rail in Chicago. The stage was so small it barely held the trio and they grew a large following. TV work and late career McPartland's outgoing personality and stage presence led him to try acting, resulting in a featured role in The Alcoa Hour episode \\"The Magic Horn\\" in 1956 with Sal Mineo, Ralph Meeker, and other jazz musicians. He also later performed in a production of Show Boat. In 1961, he appeared on a DuPont Show of the Month musical extravaganza called Chicago and All That Jazz, featuring Gene Krupa, Jack Teagarden, Eddie Condon, Pee Wee Russell, and Lil Armstrong. McPartland performed as guest star with many bands and at festivals during the 1970s in the US and out of the country. The McPartlands divorced in 1970. They continued to work together, remained friends, and remarried a few weeks before Jimmy's death. He died of lung cancer in Port Washington, New York in 1991, two days before his 84th birthday. Honors In 1992, Jimmy McPartland was inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame.

Early life He was born in Fürth, in southern Germany, but when he was four, his family moved to the city of Bamberg, today a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its medieval cathedral and many other gems of art and architecture from the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Baroque. It was there that he spent his childhood and youth, and the beauty of that city and its surrounding area, the region of Germany known as \\"Franconian Switzerland,\\" inspired him from his boyhood to the end of his life. Soon after the Nazis came to power, Zwiebel and his family left Germany; he and his four siblings were raised as Lutherans by their mother, but his father was Jewish, as well as politically active against the Nazis. In 1935, Zwiebel immigrated to the United States, living first in Milwaukee and then settling in New York City, where in 1941 he married Clara Fried, a portrait painter who had studied with American Realist artist Tully Filmus. They had one child, a daughter. Zwiebel served in the U.S. Army during World War II and became an American citizen in 1944. For the next 20 years he worked at a variety of \\"day jobs,\\" painting whenever he had free time. Among other things, he worked as a baker, ski salesman, and commercial artist. From 1949-1953, he was a radio personality in New York City, where he had a weekly program, \\"Music From Alfred Zwiebel's Collection,\\" on station WABF,http://www.jjonz.us/RadioLogs/pagesnfiles/logs_files/1950s/1952/52_10Oct/%5Bn%5D52-10-22-(Wed).pdf. playing opera and classical music recordings from his own extensive collection (opera was another of his lifelong passions). He also occasionally wrote articles on music for publication.See, for example: Alfred Zwiebel, \\"Whatever Happened to Heldentenors?\\", MUSIC JOURNAL magazine, Vol. XXI, No. 7/October 1963, pp. 26-28. Two singers engaged at the Metropolitan Opera in the 1950s and '60s, Lisa Della Casa and Anneliese Rothenberger, studied painting with him while in New York.,Debeljevic, Dragan (1975), Ein Leben mit Lisa Della Casa (A Life with Lisa Della Casa), Atlantis Verlag, Zürich, , p. 151: \\"As long as we lived in Forest Hills, we socialized with a couple, both of whom were painters, Clara and Alfred Zwiebel. [They] painted in different styles, [she] in a more academic manner, [he] very impressionistically; we took a lively part in the discussions about this, and my wife often watched the prolific Alfred while he painted. ... She discovered painting; Clara and Alfred initiated her into the techniques, and she painted in every free minute. She was often urged to exhibit her pictures, but she declined.\\" (The original German reads: \\"Solange wir in Forest Hills wohnten, verkehrten wir mit einem Malerehepaar, Clara und Alfred Zwiebel. [Sie] malten verschieden, [sie] eher akademisch, [er] ungestüm impressionistisch; wir beteiligten uns lebhaft an den Diskussionen darüber, und meine Frau sah oft dem produktivten Alfred bein Malen zu. ... Sie entdeckte das Malen; Clara und Alfred weihten sie ins Handwerkliche ein, sie malte in jeder freien Minute. Mehrmals wurde sie aufgefordert, ihre Bilder auszustellen, aber sie lehnte es ab.\\")\\"Die schönsten 'Zwiebeln' hängen an der Wand\\" (\\"The most beautiful 'Zwiebels' are on the wall,\\" [N.B.: a play on words, as \\"Zwiebel\\" in German can mean \\"flower bulb,\\" and Mainau is an island famous for its floral gardens]), Mainau- Inselpost magazine, Nr. 1, April 1977, p. 6: \\"... We mean the exhibition of paintings by Alfred Zwiebel of New York in the Castle's Hall of Heraldry. From April 1st to May 8th, visitors to Mainau will be able to see paintings by this noted artist. Alfred Zwiebel, incidentally, was Anneliese Rothenberger's painting and drawing teacher when she was in New York for a protracted stay.\\" (The original reads, \\"...

Rothenberger later made a successful career as a painter after she retired from singing. Artistic Career and Exhibitions By the 1960s, he was able to devote himself to painting full-time. In the ensuing decades, his work was shown in galleries and museums across the United States, and in England, Austria and his native Germany, where he achieved particular critical acclaim. (Excerpts from some reviews are included below.) When in 1977 Countess and Count Lennart Bernadotte opened a public art gallery in their castle on Mainau Island, a popular tourist site on Lake Constance (Bodensee) because of its spectacular gardens, Zwiebel was invited to give the inaugural exhibition.Exhibition entitled,\\"Malerische Impressionen von Alfred Zwiebel, New York\\" (\\"Painterly Impressions by Alfred Zwiebel, New York\\"), Mainau Castle, Mainau Island, Germany, April 1-May 8, 1977.

See also Note 20. Work Zwiebel worked in oil, pastel, and oil pastel (also called oilstick). Some of his work was done using rather dark values, especially a number of landscapes painted largely in blue and purple tones. Generally, however, Zwiebel was known for the vibrancy of his palette, as evidenced, for example, in the following press review (entitled \\"Optimism Expressed in Color\\"): Style and Influences Zwiebel was artistically somewhat out of sync with many of the artists of his own and subsequent generations, as he felt alienated by, and rejected, much of 20th-century modernism, particularly Abstract Expressionism. He felt the deepest affinity for Impressionism. The individual artists by whom he was most strongly influenced were Claude Monet (like Monet, he was fascinated by water lilies and made a great number of paintings of them), Camille Pissarro, Vincent van Gogh, and, in his flower paintings, Odilon Redon. When asked to which stylistic movement he felt he most belonged, he replied, \\"An artist must be free to work in whatever style the moment calls for, but if anything, I would call myself a modern impressionist.\\" Although some of his paintings are more post-impressionistic or even expressionistic in style, most art critics who reviewed his work also called him an Impressionist: \\"Zwiebel is an 'admitted romanticist' and adds he's quite proud of this fact. Many of his canvases have the lyrical beauty of the French Impressionists. Looking over the walls of the Zwiebel home, soft pastels shimmer about. Paintings of a Long Island pond, a cabbage patch in Scarsdale, have much of the beauty of the great landscapes of Monet and Pissarro.\\" William A. Raidy, \\"'Ape and Worm' School of Painting Appalls Long Island Artist,\\" Long Island Sunday Press, New York, Second News Section, November 9, 1958. \\"Zwiebel has a capacity of feeling as turbulent as van Gogh, as soft as Turner, and as impressionistic as Monet.\\" \\"Aus Münchner Galerien/Prominenz bei Schumacher\\" (\\"From Munich Galleries/Celebrities at Schumacher's\\"), Süddeutsche Zeitung, Munich, Germany, 16 January 1968. The original German text reads: \\"Zwiebel hat die Fähigkeit, gleichzeitig so wild wie van Gogh, so weich wie Turner und so impressionistisch wie Monet zu empfinden.\\" \\"Alfred Zwiebel uses the impressionistic technique with all its wealth of light, nuanced play of color, and open palette, and this breathes life into what he paints. ...

The original German text reads: \\"Alfred Zwiebel bedient sich der impressionistischen Technik, mit allen Möglichkeiten der Lichtfülle, des nuancierten Farbenspiels und der offenen Palette. So bringt er Leben in die Darstellung... Man könnte Zwiebel einen verspäteten Pissarro nennen, jedoch mit dem Beding, daß er ein Pissarro für heutige Augen ist. Chri.\\" \\"Zwiebel, whose models have always been the great Impressionists, has intentionally remained apart from the 'Moderns'... He stayed with Impressionism. But he has achieved, as the paintings exhibited here prove, mastery in this style. His landscapes are imbued with life; his flower still lifes have an almost tropical opulence of colors and forms. To view these works gives one great pleasure.\\" Karl Lemke, \\"Sonderausstellung Alfred Zwiebel\\" (\\"Special Exhibit of Alfred Zwiebel\\"), Münchner Jüdische Nachrichten, Munich, Germany, 12 January 1968, p.2, Nr.2. The original German text reads: \\"Zwiebel, dessen Vorbilder stets die großen Impressionisten waren, hält sich bewußt abseits der 'Moderne' ... Er blieb beim Impressionismus. Hier aber erreichte er, wie die ausgestellten Werke beweisen, Meisterschaft. Seine Landschaften sind von eindringlicher Lebendigkeit, seine Blumenstilleben zuweilen von einer fast tropischen Üppigkeit der Farben und Formen. Man verweilt vor ihnen mit Freude.\\" \\"Zwiebel has often been called a 'modern impressionist.' His works, with all their nuances of light and richness of palate [sic], are predominantly impressionistic in style although they also have a uniquely individual expressionist character, wherein the inner essence of a subject is more important than its outward form.\\"\\"Gallery Highlights: Alfred Zwiebel at Mary Anthony Gallery,\\" The Nouveau Magazine (New Hope, PA), Vol. XII, No. 7, August 1992, p. 17. Later Years and Death Zwiebel continued to paint until the end of his life, although in his later years he had to struggle with failing eyesight and loss of color perception due to cataracts, as well as with Alzheimer's disease. He died of pneumonia in New York City at the age of 90.

Soldierfish, Baker Island NWR Grey reef sharks, Pacific Remote Islands MNM The Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument is a group of unorganized, mostly unincorporated United States Pacific Island territories managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service of the United States Department of the Interior and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United States Department of Commerce.Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents: Monday, January 12, 2009 Volume 45—Number 1, Page 14 These remote refuges are \\"the most widespread collection of marine- and terrestrial-life protected areas on the planet under a single country's jurisdiction\\". They protect many endemic species including corals, fish, shellfish, marine mammals, seabirds, water birds, land birds, insects, and vegetation not found elsewhere. History The Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument was proclaimed a national monument on January 6, 2009, by U.S. President George W. Bush and follows his June 6, 2006, creation of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. It was expanded on September 25, 2014 by U.S. President Barack Obama. The monument covers , spanning areas to the far south and west of Hawaii: Kingman Reef, Palmyra Atoll, Howland Island, Baker Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, and Wake Island. At Howland Island, Baker Island, Jarvis Island, Palmyra Atoll, and Kingman Reef the terrestrial areas, reefs, and waters out to (radius) are part of the National Wildlife Refuge System. For Kingman Reef and Palmyra Atoll and Howland Island and Baker Island, fishery- related activities seaward from the refuge boundaries out to the NMM boundary (about square across) are managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. For Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, and Wake Island fishery- related activities seaward from the refuge boundaries out to the NMM boundary (U.S. EEZ waters) are managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The land areas at Wake and Johnston Atolls remain under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Air Force, but the waters from 0 to are protected as units of the National Wildlife Refuge System. The entire monument is closed to commercial fishing and other resource extraction activities, such as deep sea mining.Whitehouse.gov (25 Sept 2014) \\"FACT SHEET: President Obama to Designate Largest Marine Monument in the World Off-Limits to Development\\". Retrieved 25 Sept 2014. The monument includes endemic trees, grasses, and birds adapted to life at the Equator; the rare sea turtles and whales and Hawaiian monk seals that visit Johnston Atoll; and high-quality coral reefs. U.S. federal law prohibits resource destruction or extraction, waste dumping, and commercial fishing in the monument areas. Research, free passage, and recreation are allowed. On June 17, 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama proposed using his executive powers to expand the marine protected area to . Sport fishing is exempt and public comments were solicited.Eilperin, Juliet. (17 June 2014) \\"Obama proposes vast expansion of Pacific Ocean sanctuaries for marine life\\". Washington Post. Retrieved 17 June 2014. He then signed a proclamation on September 25, 2014, expanding the monument to six times its original size, resulting in 490,343 square miles (1,269,982 square kilometers) of protected area around these tropical islands and atolls in the south-central Pacific Ocean. Expanding the monument protected the deep coral reefs, seamounts, and marine ecosystems unique to this part of the world, which are also among the most vulnerable areas to the impacts of climate change and ocean acidification. In September 2017, Trump Administration U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke recommended that the boundaries of the monument be reduced by an unspecified amount.  Geography  Location and area The following islands form the basis of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument: *Baker Island, an atoll in the North Pacific Ocean southwest of Honolulu, coordinates , about halfway between Hawaii and Australia. The atoll has a total area of 129 km², of which 2.1 km² is land and 127 km² is water. *Howland Island, an island in the North Pacific Ocean southwest of Honolulu, coordinates , about halfway between Hawaii and Australia. The island has a total area of 139 km², of which 2.6 km² is land and 136 km² is water. *Jarvis Island, an island in the South Pacific Ocean south of Honolulu, coordinates , about halfway between Hawaii and the Cook Islands. The island has a total area of 152 km², of which 5 km² is land and 147 km² is water. *Johnston Atoll, an atoll in the North Pacific Ocean southwest of Honolulu, coordinates , about one-third of the way from Hawaii to the Marshall Islands. The atoll has a total area of 276.6 km², of which 2.6 km² is land and 274 km² is water. *Kingman Reef, a reef in the North Pacific Ocean south of Honolulu, coordinates , about halfway between Hawaii and American Samoa. The reef has a total area of 1,958.01 km², of which 0.01 km² is land and 1,958 km² is water. *Palmyra Atoll, an atoll in the North Pacific Ocean south of Honolulu, coordinates , about halfway between Hawaii and American Samoa. The atoll has a total area of 1,949 km², of which 3.9 km² is land and 1,946 km² is water. * Wake Island Climate Susan White, Operations Superintendent, holding a young red-footed booby, 2014 Because the islands are scattered throughout the ocean, the climate is different on each island. Baker, Howland, and Jarvis Islands have an equatorial climate, with scant rainfall, constant wind, and burning sun. Johnston Atoll and Kingman Reef have a tropical climate, but are generally dry, with consistent northeast trade winds with little seasonal temperature variation. Palmyra Atoll has a hot, equatorial climate. Because the atoll is located within the low pressure area of the Intertropical Convergence Zone where the northeast and southeast trade winds meet, it is extremely wet with between of rainfall each year.  Population  Although the islands have no permanent residents, the seven islands that make up the Pacific Remote Islands are stepping stones that connect Hawaii to Micronesia, and other Polynesian sea voyaging cultures. The voyage from Hawaii to neighboring Marshall Islands once included a stop at Johnston Atoll. Wake Atoll is geographically, culturally, and historically linked to the people who live in the Republic of the Marshall Islands.

Wake has a current transient population of ca. 125 military personnel and contractors. Johnston Atoll had a peak population of 1,100 military and civilian contractor personnel in 2000, but it was evacuated by 2007. Since 2010, volunteer biologists live and work on the island in groups of 5. Four to twenty Nature Conservancy and U.S. Fish and Wildlife staff live at Palmyra Atoll at any one time. The four other islands are usually uninhabited. Public entry to the islands is by special-use permit from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and is generally restricted to scientists and educators. Only Wake Island, Palmyra Atoll and Johnston Atoll have serviceable runways; Jarvis, Baker and Howland Islands had airstrips in earlier times but they have long been abandoned and are no longer operational.

Pork and duck are the most common animal used to create this raw blood pudding. The most popular is tiết canh vịt, made from freshly killed duck blood and duck meat. Typical preparation The freshly drawn blood is collected in a bowl, and prevented from premature coagulation (hãm huyết), by mixing it with some fish sauce of certain proportions, usually three to five soup spoons of fish sauce for one quart (approximately 1 liter) of blood. Finely chopped meat such as cooked duck innards (gizzards, for example) and duck meat are put in a shallow dish along with a sprinkling of crushed peanuts and chopped herbs such as Vietnamese coriander, mint, etc. The blood and fish sauce mixture is then diluted with some watery broth left from cooking the meat and/or gizzards to promote blood coagulation, then quickly poured into the prepared meat dish. The finished dish can be kept cool in the refrigerator, which allows the blood to maintain its coagulated state, when immediate consumption is not called for right away. If the dish is removed from the refrigerator and left to sit at room temperature for a while the blood will return to a liquid state. Health risk Raw pig's blood often contains swine bacteria, and ingesting them may cause severe bacterial infections. For example, a streptococcus bacterium infection may cause respiratory decline, blood contamination, and severe necrosis in arms and legs, and is potentially fatal. In Vietnam, there are reports of human casualties after eating raw blood pudding.

His real name was . Early life Osaragi Jirō was born in Yokohama. His father was a temple carpenter originally from Kii Province, who had rebuilt the main halls and main gates of a number of noted Buddhist temples. His older brother Hōei Nojiri, was a noted scholar of English literature and an astronomer. He graduated with honors from Shirogane Jinjo Elementary School, and later wrote in his memoirs that he first became interested in becoming a writer in the sixth grade, where the daughter of Kosugi Tengai was a classmate. He then attended the Furitsu Daiichi Junior High School. While still in high school, he published his first work, Ichiko Romance, which described life in the school dormitory. He also became interested in the theatre. Osaragi attended Tokyo Imperial University’s Department of Political Science, where he developed a strong sense of resistance to authoritarianism. After graduation, he obtained a posting as a teacher at the Kamakura Higher Girls' School (present-day Kamakura Jogakuin High School), located in Kamakura, Kanagawa prefecture. Because of his language skills, he was recruited by the Foreign Ministry in 1922, and worked for about a year in the Treaties Bureau. However after the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, he decided to devote himself full time to writing. Literary career In 1924 Osaragi Jirō published his first popular historical novel, Hayabusa no Genji which was serialized in the magazine, Pocket. At this time he was living in Kamakura behind the famous . The kanji for Daibutsu can also be read Osaragi which became the source of his pen-name, Osaragi Jirō. However, his choice of pen name of Osaragi was not mere whimsy: The Osaragi branch of the Hōjō clan descended from Hōjō Tokifusa, were prominent warriors mentioned in the Kamakura period chronicle Taiheiki. Their estates were located near the Great Buddha. Osaragi's popular fiction novels with historical settings such as Kurama Tengu (1924–1959), Teru Hi Kumoru Hi (\\"Sunny Days Cloudy Days\\", 1926–1927), and Ako Roshi (\\"Loyal Retainers of Ako\\", 1927–1928), were serialized in newspapers and magazines, and gained him a tremendous following. Many were later made into movies and television series, with Kanjūrō Arashi, for instance, making a name for himself playing Kurama Tengu. However, Osaragi also wrote works of contemporary fiction such as Shiroi Ane (\\"White Sister\\") and Kiribue (\\"Misty Flute\\"). Kikyō (\\"Homecoming\\", 1948) described the author's anger at petty attitudes which surfaced after World War II, and was awarded the Japan Art Academy Prize in 1950. Osaragi also won the Asahi Prize in 1952. In 1964, he was awarded the Order of Culture by the Japanese government. Osaragi was deeply influenced by French literature and culture, and wrote a number non-fiction pieces displaying his deep understanding of controversial events in Europe: Dorefyus jiken (\\"The Dreyfus Affair\\"), Buranje Shogun no Higeki (\\"The Tragedy of General Boulanger\\"), and Pari Moyu (\\"Paris is Burning\\"; a history of the Paris Commune). When he died in 1973 at the age of 75, he was still writing Tennō no Seiki (\\"Century of Emperors\\"), a historical chronicle based on the spiritual history of the Japanese people. Private life Osaragi lived in Kamakura, Kanagawa prefecture from 1921 to his death in 1973. Osaragi was a central figure in Kamakura's literary life, and he also campaigned avidly for the protection of Kamakura's scenic beauty. When housing developers threatened the mountainside behind Kamakura's famous Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū, he banded together with a number of famous literati and artists (including Hideo Kobayashi, Nagai Tatsuo, Yasunari Kawabata, Riichi Yokomitsu, Itō Shinsui, Kiyokata Kaburagi), residing in Kamakura to oppose the development. This led to the foundation of the Japan National Trust, modeled after the National Trust in Great Britain, and which has been successful in preserving the historical ambience of Kamakura and parts of other cities around Japan. Osaragi Jirō was a noted cat lover. Friends and neighbors claimed that he fed at least 500 semi-feral cats at his house in Kamakura. Osaragi also served for two months in the cabinet of Prime Minister Prince Higashikuni Naruhiko as a councillor. Osaragi died of liver cancer in 1973 at the age of 75. His grave is at the temple of Jufuku-ji in Kamakura. Despite Osaragi's long association with Kamakura, due to a dispute over inheritance taxes, his manuscripts and artifacts were donated to the city of Yokohama by his heirs, where they now form the collection of the Osaragi Jirō Commemorative Museum. His former house in Kamakura remains in private hands, and is open (occasionally) to the public. After his death, the Asahi Shimbun established a literary prize, the Osaragi Jiro Prize, which is awarded for the best book published in Japan in the field of social sciences.

It is known for the direct-to- video series Puppet Master, Trancers, and Subspecies, as well as the film Castle Freak and the VideoZone featurette through 1989 to 2013. History Full Moon Productions era (1988–1995) 100px After the collapse of Band's previous film studio Empire Pictures, he moved back to the United States from Rome and opened Full Moon Productions. Band's goal with Full Moon was to create low-budget horror, sci-fi, and fantasy films while retaining a somewhat \\"big-budget\\" look. In the United States, Full Moon teamed with Paramount Pictures and Pioneer Home Entertainment for direct-to-video releasing on VHS and LaserDisc and the first release was the feature film directed by David Schmoeller, Puppet Master in 1989. Puppet Master turned out to be a huge hit for Full Moon. Following the film on VHS and LaserDisc was a featurette entitled No Strings Attached, which documents the making of Puppet Master. It featured interviews with cast and crew members, including actor Paul Le Mat and Charles Band himself. The next three releases—Shadowzone, Meridian: Kiss of the Beast, and Crash and Burn (changing to Full Moon Entertainment with the release of the latter)—all featured a making-of presentation after the film. Paramount, however, didn't believe in the making-of concept and forced Band to pay for all of the additional tape needed. At the same time, Band also reissued two catalog titles, Tourist Trap and Parasite through Paramount. Some controversy arose, however, many years after the release of Puppet Master. In an interview on the website The Terror Trap, Puppet Master director, David Schmoeller, says that Charles Band owes him residuals, as well as stating that Charles Band doesn't give credit to directors. Schmoeller continues, saying that Band didn't want him on the director's commentary on the DVD release of Puppet Master, because \\"it would reveal that someone else shared in the creation of Full Moon's biggest and most successful franchise.\\"Terrortrap.com With the fifth Full Moon release Puppet Master II in 1991, Full Moon introduced VideoZone, a behind-the-scenes video magazine. The average VideoZone featured an introduction by Charles Band, the making-of the \\"movie you just watched,\\" an interview with someone involved in a future Full Moon release, merchandise (such as Full Moon T-shirts, posters and other assorted goods), trailers, and contact information. VideoZone tied together the \\"comic book feel\\" that Band insisted with the Full Moon product. 125px Full Moon continued producing its releases throughout the early '90s (sometimes as many as twelve releases a year) and in 1993 founded two more labels: Torchlight Entertainment, specializing in softcore pornographic sci-fi comedies and Moonbeam Entertainment, specializing in family orientated sci-fi and fantasy films. Torchlight's first release was Beach Babes From Beyond; Moonbeam's was Prehysteria!, which actually became a high seller for distributor Paramount and was one of the first Full Moon films to be sold as an inexpensive sell- through product (as most Full Moon features were sold on VHS as rental items with prices upwards of $100 for each tape). Full Moon Studios era (1995–2002) In 1995, due to the direct-to-video market losing interest and financial ground with the rental market in addition to internal issues, Full Moon Entertainment separated from distributor Paramount. Full Moon's Halloween 1995 production Castle Freak was released on video unrated. After the releases of Castle Freak and Oblivion 2: Backlash, Band renamed Full Moon Entertainment, Full Moon Studios for the feature Vampire Journals and used the name Full Moon Pictures for the following film Hideous!. Band continued to distribute all films on his own under then name of Amazing Fantasy Entertainment until around 1999 when some of the films were distributed by The Kushner-Locke Company. With the release of Shrieker in 1998, Band enlisted the help of Ohio-based filmmaker and Tempe Entertainment founder, J. R. Bookwalter, who had recently relocated to California. Bookwalter was commissioned by Band to begin editing features, including Curse of the Puppet Master. Curse of the Puppet Master created due to demand from video retailers for a new installment of the Puppet Master franchise isn't held in high regards with fans of the genre. To conserve costs (as most Full Moon features were being made for much less than the Paramount-distributed films), the film was put together using footage from the first five Puppet Master files, as well as some new footage. However, Bookwalter's work got Full Moon noticed on Apple.com where a story was published about Bookwalter's editing of Curse of the Puppet Master on his iBook in a hotel room in Ohio. Over the next several years, Full Moon continued its releases and even introduced more labels: *Alchemy Entertainment/Big City Pictures – specializing in urban horror and science-fiction films. *Surrender Cinema – replacing Torchlight Entertainment, specializing in the same soft-core science fiction as Torchlight. *Cult Video – mainly used to re-release old pre-Empire and Empire-era Band films. *Pulp Fantasy Productions – New films that don't fit the usual Full Moon mold. *Pulsepounders – Replacing Moonbeam Entertainment, specializing in science fiction and fantasy films for families. Bookwalter would eventually get the chance to direct a Full Moon film with the sequel to Witchouse, Witchouse 2: Blood Coven. It was Bookwalter's first film on 35 mm and with it opened a new door for Bookwalter's Tempe Entertainment. Starting with Horror Vision, Tempe Entertainment was hired to produce several Full Moon films for Band. All of these films were shot on DV, a first for Full Moon and were primarily made for under $60,000 (with Witchouse 3: Demon Fire completed for $26,000). The films were produced under very tight schedules, some being shot in as little as nine days. While the production drawbacks were high in each situation, this opportunity gave new exposure to Bookwalter and Tempe who was accustomed to producing films on shoestring budgets. Once again, the industry changed and Band decided to end the Full Moon label with the 2002 release of Jigsaw. During this era of Full Moon, Band secured a weekly television series on the Sci Fi Channel called William Shatner's Full Moon Fright Night. Veteran actor, William Shatner, hosted Full Moon films with wraparounds, as well as interviews with many of sci-fi's most notable personalities, including Stan Lee and Jeffrey Combs. Tempe also received exposure here as HorrorVision was included in this short-lived series. With the release of 2000's The Dead Hate the Living!, Band dropped the VideoZone name and produced behind-the-scenes featurettes without a masthead. Shadow Films era (2002–2004) 150px Blockbuster Entertainment, a longtime supporter of the Full Moon brand requested the company produce a slasher film, due to the late '90s resurgence of this subgenre, thanks to Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. With the help of an uncredited Tempe Entertainment, Band produced Bleed and acquired Keith Walley's Scared, renaming it Cut Throat. Band produced only two more films \\"officially\\" under the Shadow name: (Birthrite, Delta Delta Die!). Another Keith Walley film Speck was acquired. William Shatner's DV science- fiction movie Groom Lake, produced by J.R. Bookwalter became notorious as one of the most-expensive films of the modern era of Full Moon. 175px Band also decided around this time to bring back an old label used in the Empire era named Wizard Video, which distributed cult-like films. This modern rendition saw the release of Tempe's Skinned Alive and Ozone (renamed Street Zombies for the Wizard release). However, due to low sales, another Tempe film Bloodletting (which was also renamed: I've Killed Before) was dropped from the release schedule. In 2003, Charles Band entered into a deal with 20th Century Fox to produce a low budget horror movie. Fox would distribute the movie and Band would retain copyrights. The film was directed by J.R. Bookwalter and named Deadly Stingers. In the tradition of the giant killer bug movies, Deadly Stingers was about giant scorpions taking over a town. However, after the film was completed, it was shelved due to a decline in the industry and low sales of another similar project at Fox (excluding Full Moon) entitled Dark Wolf. The film was shown at the Frightvision Horror Festival in 2003, but while it has surfaced on Full Moon Streaming as of December 2013 under the name of Mega Scorpions, it has yet to see a release on DVD or Blu-ray. A teaser trailer for the film does exist on J. R. Bookwalter's Tempe Entertainment website. The second Full Moon Pictures era (2004–present) In late 2003, Band began work on his first 35 mm film in years, Dr. Moreau's House of Pain. The film released in January 2004 also marked the official return of the name Full Moon Pictures. However, the film's video releases all contain the name of Shadow Entertainment, but the film's trailer contains the Full Moon Pictures logo. Quickly before the release of Dr. Moreau's House of Pain, Full Moon released Puppet Master: The Legacy, a \\"greatest hits\\" film that contained the best scenes from all (hitherto) seven Puppet Master films with about 20 minutes of a wrap-around story and very bad puppet effects (string rods can be seen in almost every scene featuring the puppets). Once again, all video releases said Shadow Entertainment, but the trailer contained the Full Moon Pictures logo. On the heels of Puppet Master: The Legacy, Band quickly cut together Tomb of Terror, Horrific, and Urban Evil. These three films edited by HorrorVision director, Danny Draven, were clip shows that showed off the best in Full Moon's library. After the release of those films, Band re-christened the Full Moon name to Full Moon Features. Full Moon Features intends to take more time making films with considerably higher budgets and on 35 mm film and as of July 2006 has focused on that with the exceptions of When Puppets and Dolls Attack!, Monsters Gone Wild!, and Aliens Gone Wild! (all clip shows). In 2005, Charles Band embarked on the Full Moon Horror Roadshow, a traveling, live Full Moon-inspired show featuring Band and actors/actresses from past Full Moon films. Some shows also featured his son, Alex Band. At all shows, Band offered a contest for a chance for a member of the audience to have a part in a future Full Moon feature. As of 2009, none of these winners had received their roles. However, on August 27, 2009, Band blogged that those who were chosen would have the opportunity to be cast in his next project.Charlesband.com Band continued the roadshow in 2006, this time putting it in smaller venues. A similar contest offering a part in a movie was held at these events. In 2011, contest winners were contacted for the chance to be extras in the movie Gingerdead Man 3: Saturday Night Cleaver. Available winners who could make it to the set were featured as extras in the movie during a mass electrocution scene at a roller rink. Full Moon uploaded pictures of the contest winners onset on its official Facebook page.Facebook In 2009, Band hopes to expand Full Moon to a similar release schedule more like the mid-1990s with a new release every month. Additionally, the company plans to add sequels to many franchises, including Puppet Master, Demonic Toys, and Head of the Family. In 2012, the Videozone was brought back, making its return on the DVD release of Puppet Master X: Axis Rising. In addition, the Moonbeam Entertainment brand label was revived under the name Moonbeam Films. The studio's nearly thirty- year history is covered in the book It Came From the Video Aisle written by Dave Jay, William S. Wilson, and Torsten Dewi and published by Schiffer Publishing in October 2017.

In 2012, it was the second most popular fetish search on Google as per their global monthly averages. Stimuli Licking the navel is one of the primary turn-ons. A navel fetishist can be sexually aroused by a variety of stimuli, including key words, thoughts or specific forms of physical interaction with the navel. Ice on the navel region can produce erotic sensations. Physical activity Some navel fetishists find physical acts involving the navel to be turn-ons. Physical acts can include licking the navel with the tongue or rubbing body lotion or suntan oil. Some fetishists get a turn-on from pouring drops of champagne, honey, chocolate sauce, whipped cream, etc., into and around the navel and then licking or sucking it up. Similarly, licking or rolling the tongue into the navel while underwater can produce erotic sensations. An ice cube when rubbed over or rested over the navel can produce erotic sensations. The navel is an erogenous zone with a heightened sensitivity.A celebration of sex - Douglas E. Rosenau - Chapter 3 - Your Erogenous Zones.

Fingering the navel is also a common act. A Belly dancer with a navel piercing. Some prefer to perform navel torture, a series of pain-inflicting acts such as sucking or pulling the navel out (often with a syringe), dripping hot oil or wax into the navel, poking pins into the navel, and stabbing the navel. This attention is usually directed at a partner's navel, but may include a fixation on the fetishist's own navel. A sex worker in Turkey stated that some men have attempted to have sexual intercourse by inserting their penis into her navel. Viewing and fantasizing activity Some navel fetishists can be aroused by viewing a navel. In the case of a heterosexual man, women in bikini is one such example. Also women dressed in low-rise clothing like jeans, shorts etc., that reveals the navel is also considered sexually arousing. Indian journalist Bachi Karkaria once commented, \\"The navel is an erogenous zone. This is the reason why its exposure is always in fashion. Women have flashed it through the ages because men are turned on by it. It is shown because it wants to be seen\\". Videos featuring above said physical acts are very common and are viewed worldwide. Their popularity has become more compared to regular porn videos. Fetish model Wonderhussy stated in her blog that she had performed in belly button fetish videos in which she laid back and played with her belly button, poking her finger in it and stretching it out. Other models such as Elan kane, Indica etc., have also featured in similar videos. Belly dancers often have navel piercings or insert sequins into their navels to make it look attractive when they perform. Not only them, many young everyday women also have them to add a charm to their navels. Such decorations also arouse when seen. Sometimes just the thought of the navel is enough to stimulate. Some navel fetishists sexually fantasize about the above physical acts on a person's navel to attain sexual pleasure. The Samoan tribe people find the sight of the navel sexually arousing.Cultural variations on sex Literature Sometimes literary works focusing on navels or which sexually symbolize navels can also act as stimuli to navel fetishists. One such work is Navel Revue by author Jay Hahn-Lonne which is an autobiographical study of a man's obsession with navels. In the Song of Songs, a book in the Hebrew Bible, there are allusions to exotic things in nature, with frequent interweaving of nature with erotic imagery. In Solomon's lavish praise of his love – the country girl, Sulaimi – the navel is mentioned as follows: \\"thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies.\\" (7:2). American poet May Swenson in her poem \\"Little Lion Face\\" wrote, \\"Now I'm bold to touch your swollen neck, put careful lips to slick petals, snuff up gold pollen in your navel cup.\\" and poem \\"August Night\\" wrote, \\"Your navel a little pool in pulsing tide an aura round your knees\\". Czech-born writer Milan Kundera in his 2015 book The Festival of Insignificance conveys about the eroticism of exposed female navels. Alain, one of the characters in the book, observes to his friend how most of the young women in Paris wear T-shirts or blouses that expose their midriffs, displaying their navels for all to see. The navel has become, in effect, the new locus of desire. Robert W. Service in his short poem \\"Navels\\" wrote, \\"Men have navels more or less;....Woman's is a pearly ring,....So dear ladies, recognise The dimpling of your waist Has approval in my eyes,Favour in my taste......How a rosebud navel would Be sweet to kiss!\\" In Ancient Indian Sanskrit literature, writers like Adi Shankara, Kālidāsa etc., have symbolized and referred to the navel while describing the beauty of Hindu Goddesses. Erotica During 1970, a short lived \\"Belly Button Magazine\\" having only two issues recovered by The Kinsey Institute had descriptions of penetrative belly button intercourse and sexual images of physical acts towards belly buttons. In 2011, MTJ Publishing which publishes adult comics released a bellybutton focused series, \\"Navel Maneuvers 1: Bellybutton-Tickling Erotica\\" In 2014, a Kindle erotica eBook titled \\"Bellybutton Fetish: Erotic and naughty stories for bellybutton lovers\\" was published online through Amazon Digital Services, Inc. In the same year, MTJ Publishing released a second edition of the Navel Maneuvers series. Film The 2006 film Super Heroine Witch Hunter SAYAKA, starring actress Hikari Gonoi, features an iconic scene where Gonoi has her belly button violently fingered for almost three minutes, and an additional scene where Gonoi's character gets poisonous rose-thorns shoved into her deep navel. Connections to other fetishes Navel fetishism often co-exists with stomach fetishism or alvinolagnia. Navel fetishism may co-exist with sadomasochism since some navel fetishists prefer to perform or receive navel torture. Some prefer to engage in physical intercourse, which is commonly linked to weight-related stomach fetishes like BBW, feederism, and belly expansion. Prevalence on the Internet During the late nineties, there was a small but thriving online group of belly button fetish sites. These sites were maintained by individuals and usually hosted on third-party forum sites like ProBoards or InsideTheWeb. Each forum catered to a unique variation on the fetish, but were mostly the same in that they had individual boards for celebrity photos, candids, erotica, and personal stories. As the internet outgrew forums in favor of social networks and corporate porn sites, these sites began shutting down one by one. Subsequently, the site The Original Bellybutton Forum (OBF) became popular but got shut down due to admin-related problems. It reconvened with the name BellyLove but met the same fate as OBF. Celebrities Madonna Billie Piper Rebecca Romijn The following are some celebrities who have a fixation for navels. * Renowned singer Madonna in an interview for the May 1985 edition of Spin had said, \\"My favorite button is my belly button. I have the most perfect belly button: an inny, and there's no lint in it. When I stick my finger in my belly button, I feel a nerve in the center of my body shoot up my spine. If 100 belly buttons were lined up against a wall, I could definitely pick out which one is mine.\\"Confessions Of A Madonna - May 1985 . Displaying her bare navel during performances became her trademark. * American actor Sal Mineo had a fetish for navels. His partner Courtney Burr had once commented in an interview that he came to know about Sal Mineo's navel fetish. In the book Sal Mineo: A Biography, author Michael Gregg Michaud wrote, \\"Sal had an insatiable sex appetite.

History Crystal Cave was discovered on November 12, 1871, while John Gehret and William Merkel were in the process of extracting limestone from a steep hill near Kutztown, Pennsylvania for use by neighboring farmers to improve the quality of their fields. After setting off a dynamite charge to free the limestone, they noticed that they had created a hole large enough to walk through. Almost immediately after word broke about their find, locals began entering the cave to explore it, frequently removing the calcite and aragonite crystals and rock specimens they found there as prized souvenirs. Frustrated by the damage being done to the cave, Greenwich Township farmer Samuel D. F. Kohler purchased the cave and surrounding land (a total of for $5,000 in early 1872, and erected a wooden door to prevent prospectors and other trespassers from entering without permission. On May 25, 1872, six months after the cave's discovery by Gehret and Merkel, Kohler then held a public ceremony in which he formally opened the cave for business.

Steele was also the first Governor of Oklahoma Territory and was instrumental in developing the state's public education system and its two largest universities. Early life and the American Civil War Steele served in Sherman's March to the Sea. Steele was born to Asbury and Marie Louise Steele in Fayette County, Indiana, on December 13, 1839. He received an education from Indiana's public school system and then earned a law degree from Ohio Wesleyan University. Following the completion of his education, Steele passed the bar exam and set up a practice in Hartford City, Indiana.Everett, Dianna. Steele, George Washington , Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture (accessed May 15, 2013) Steele continued his law practice until 1861 with the outbreak of the American Civil War. Indiana stayed loyal to the Union, and Steele joined the 12th Indiana Regiment in the Union Army as a volunteer on May 2, 1861. He later transferred to the 101st Indiana Regiment, in which he served until the conclusion of the war. Steele served under Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman in his famous March to the Sea. Following the Carolinas Campaign and the end of the war, Steele was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in July 1865. After the Civil War ended in the Union's favor and with the United States restored, Steele transferred from the volunteer army to the Regular Army. Steele was promoted to the rank of major and served in the 14th U.S. Infantry. His commission lasted for ten years, from February 23, 1866, to February 1876. Political career President Benjamin Harrison appointed Steele Governor of Oklahoma Territory. Following his retirement from the army, Steele returned to Indiana, where he settled in Marion and established a business that engaged in agricultural pursuits and pork packing. Steele's loyalty to the Union led him to join the Republican Party. He became active in local politics and gained enough support to win the race to serve as a Congressman from Indiana's 11th District in 1880. Steele was inaugurated on March 4, 1883. He retained his post for eight years, winning reelection in 1882, 1884, and 1886. After officially leaving office on March 3, 1889, Steele returned home to Marion. Within a year's time, on May 2, 1890, the western portion of the unorganized territory of modern-day Oklahoma became the Oklahoma Territory. Upon hearing reports of disorder and chaos in the new territory, President Benjamin Harrison wanted a former military officer to serve as the territory's first governor. Harrison appointed Steele to the office,Oklahoma Territory , Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture (accessed May 15, 2013) and on May 22, 1890, Steele was inaugurated in Guthrie, Oklahoma Territory. Governor of Oklahoma Territory Immediately upon entering office, Governor Steele declared a state of emergency throughout the Territory. This allowed him to best use his experience as a military officer. Steele supplemented the orderly processes of government for the Territory's disorderly situation. Unfortunately for the Governor, much of his time was occupied with a dispute with the Oklahoma Territorial Legislature. The Legislature wanted to move the capital from Guthrie, first to Oklahoma City then to Kingfisher. All of these bills were vetoed by the Governor. Steele also urged the creation of a public school system and universities of higher education in the Territory. Through his work, the Legislature approved and established two universities: one in Norman and another in Stillwater. The Norman Territorial University would become University of Oklahoma, with the Stillwater A&M; College becoming Oklahoma State University. After only seventeen months in office, Governor Steele resigned the governorship effective October 18, 1891. In his place, President Harrison appointed Abraham Jefferson Seay to the governorship. Robert Martin, Secretary of Oklahoma Territory, served as Acting Governor from October 18, 1891, until February 1892, when Governor Seay took the oath of office. National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, Marion Branch Returning to Marion, Steele remained a private citizen until he reentered state politics in 1894 when he was elected to once again represent Indiana's 11th District in the United States House of Representatives. His term officially began on March 4, 1895. While in the House, Steele served as the Chairman for the House Committee on Manufactures, during the 57th United States Congress. Steele remained in office as a Congressman until 1903, after serving eight years. The existence of the Marion Branch was due, in great part to the leadership of George Steele, Sr. of Marion, who represented the 11th Congressional District of Indiana from 1880 to 1890. During his last term, he introduced legislation to establish a branch home in Grant County in the fiftieth session of congress, the measure coming up in December, and for seven months he watched the proceedings. The bill was approved by an Act of Congress and signed by President Grover Cleveland on July 23, 1888, entitled: \\"An Act to authorize the location of a Branch Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers in Grant County, Indiana, and For Other Purposes\\". Approval of Steele's bill was received with great enthusiasm in Marion, where the local newspaper predicted that the expenditure for the branch would total at least $500,000. News of the bills passing was favorably received in Grant County and on July 30, 1888 a celebration took place and it was estimated that the streets of Marion were thronged with the largest assemblage ever reported in Marion.Historical Files, Indiana Room of the Marion Public Library: Marion Daily Chronicle, The Soldiers' Home, October 8, 1888 In early 1890 Steele became the first President of the First National Bank in Marion. However, at the request of President Benjamin Harrison, he took the position of governor of the Oklahoma Territory from mid 1890 to late 1891. Upon his return to Marion in 1894, he was elected Congressional representative for four more terms. Steele also served on the Board of Managers of the National Military Home at Marion from April 21, 1890, to December 10, 1904. On December 11, 1904, Steele became the third director of the Marion Branch, moving to the Director's House on the grounds and serving until his retirement on May 31, 1915. Death and legacy Steele once again returned to life as private citizen in Marion. At the age of 83, Steele died on July 12, 1922 in Marion. He is buried there in Odd Fellows Cemetery. Steele's most enduring legacy would not be found in his home state of Indiana or in national politics, but in Oklahoma. He instituted Oklahoma Territory's first public school system, as well as to help establish Oklahoma's premier universities: University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University. One observer noted his tenure as Governor: \\"He was a most capable executive and his unafraid service to the territory must not be minimized.\\"Dan W. Peery, \\"George W.

Guinsa is the administrative center of over 140 sub-temples and hermitages of the Cheontae sect.\\"Explore Korea - Essence of Culture and Tourism\\" p202 Although the architecture of Guinsa follows that of many other Buddhist temples in Korea, it is also markedly different in that the structures are several stories tall, instead of the typical one or two stories that structures in many other Korean temples have. This may be due to the restraints of the valley in which it is located and to modern construction techniques, but it creates a visual experience that is both beautiful and unique from what one sees at other temples. Up to 10,000 monks can live here at any one point while the kitchen can serve food for twice that number when needed.Paxton, Norbert \\"Korea\\" p343 The temple maintains and operates a large farm system covering over 60,000 pyeong/0.198 km2/0.0765 sq MI and provides much of the food prepared and consumed at the temple. As with many Korean temples, free simple vegetarian meals are served for all visitors in Guinsa at setting time (about 6:30-7:00 for breakfast, 11:30-13:30 for lunch, 18:30 for dinner), no matter your race or religion. But as Buddhism believing everything people enjoy now comes from karma of their past acts and thoughts, they have to finish their meals, whatever they have taken. The ubiquitous black slate roof tiles found commonly on Korean temples is occasionally replaced by orange glazed tiles reminding one of those seen on the roofs of Beijing's Forbidden City. Some buildings resemble the Potala Palace in Lhasa with their use of height and vertical lines.Paxton, Norbert \\"Korea\\" p343&344 Guinsa operates Geumgang University between Nonsan and Daejeon. The 2 days Temple Stay Program, twice a month, includes getting up at 3am for the morning ceremony, can be booked via internet or phone.http://temple.cheontae.org History Unlike many of Korea's temples, Guinsa is fairly new, dating only back to 1945. The temple is strikingly located, squeezed into a narrow valley surrounded on all sides by mountains, and its location was decreed by head monk Sangwol Wongak's (上月圓覺) interpretation of the Lotus Sutra. Guinsa halls fill the valley below The original temple was burned down during the Korean War, but the reconstruction of the first building was completed in 1966 and the complex, which now incorporates over 50 buildings, is still expanding. In 1967 the Cheontae school is reestablished at Guinsa and registered with the Korean government as the Cheontae Order. Master Sangwol assumes his position as the First Patriarch of the Order. The 5-Story Dharma Law Hall (5층대법당 Ocheung Daebeoptang) is completed and becomes the largest building of its kind on Korea. 1982 brings the establishment Geumgang Buddhist College at the Geumgang Institute. Early History Early history leading to the establishment of Guinsa: Cheontae Sect Logo *594 AD - The Chinese Sui Dynasty Master Zhiyi completes the Three-part Lotus Sutra and establishes the Cheontae school. *581~597 AD - Master Yeongwang of the Silla Dynasty studies the \\"Sublime Contemplation of the Lotus\\" under Master Zhiyi in China later returning to Silla to teach the Cheontae Doctrine. *730 AD - Silla monks Peopyung, Ieung and Sunyeong study the Cheontae teaching under Grand Master Chwagye Hyeonrang and return to Korea to transmit the Cheontae doctrine. *1097 AD - The Cheontae school of Korea is founded by National Master Daegak Guksa at Gukcheonsa (temple). *1424 AD - The Cheontae school is consolidated into the Zen (Seon) school as part of the Yi Dynasty's anti- Buddhist policy. This resulted in the Cheontae teachings being merged with folk Buddhism. *1855 AD - Layman Weolchang Kim Taehyeon writes \\"Seonhak Lumun (Gateway to Zen)\\", an exposition of Cheontae meditation practices, to help preserve the Cheontae traditions. Structures Notable structures include: Daejosajeon (대조사전) or Great Teacher Hall near the top of the valley. * The Great Teacher Hall (대조사전 Daejosajeon), a shrine erected in the memory of Sangwol Wongak, a large statue of whom can be found inside. * The Four Heavenly Kings Gate (사천왕문 Sacheonwangmun) is a two story stone structure, containing statues of the Four Heavenly Kings, marking the start of the temple complex. * The 5-Story Dharma Law Hall (5층대법당 Ocheung Daebeoptang), also referred to as the 5-story Grand Dharma Hall, completed in 1980 is reputedly one of the largest temple buildings in Korea, and like so many of the other buildings on the temple complex, is elaborate in both terms of painting and structural design. The first and second floors contain meditation halls for the monks. The third and fourth floors have shrine rooms for devotees wishing to offer prayer. The fifth floor contains the huge Dharma Hall housing a large gilded altar of the main Buddha Shakyamuni, Supreme Budda of the present, flanked by his attendants. On the left sits Avalokitesvara, Bodhisattva of Compassion, and on the right sits Mahasthamaprapta, Bodhisattva of wisdom.

In the past Beaulieu used mainly Jackson guitars such as the Jackson KV-2 Black Ghost Flames finish (as seen in Roadrunner United bonus DVD) and DX10D series occasionally using a B.C Rich Warlock and a Blue Ibanez guitar, until Rita Haney, partner of 20 years to Dimebag Darrell gave him and Matt Heafy each one of Dimebag's signature Dean guitars in the same year, later spawning a three-year-long endorsement with Dean Guitars, with Beaulieu sporting a black 7 string Razorback V with silver bevels. He also had a signature model V. This V is metallic red with the Trivium circle logo placed between the bridge and neck pickups and is also fitted with a Floyd Rose Locking Tremolo and a Seymour Duncan Dimebucker. He left Dean guitars in the summer of 2009, and later signed with Jackson Guitars. He has recently been seen playing various custom Jackson V guitars and is in talks with Jackson regarding the development of a signature guitar. At the 2013 Winter NAMM Show, Jackson officially released Beaulieu's Signature Guitar, available in 6- and 7-string variants, all made in the US.

Education and career Born in Gainesville, Georgia, to Thomas M. Elliott, a Methodist minister, and Mamie Glenn Elliot, Elliott received a Bachelor of Philosophy degree from Emory University in 1930. He taught school to earn money for his legal education. He received a Bachelor of Laws from Emory University School of Law in 1934. He entered private practice of law in Columbus, Georgia from 1934 to 1943. He was a member of the Georgia House of Representatives from 1937 to 1943. He was in the United States Navy as a Lieutenant from 1943 to 1946, serving in the Pacific. He returned to private practice in Columbus from 1946 to 1962. He was again a member of the Georgia House of Representatives from 1947 to 1949. He was also a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1948 and 1952. Federal judicial service Elliott was nominated by President John F. Kennedy on January 23, 1962, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia vacated by Judge Thomas Hoyt Davis. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 7, 1962, and received his commission on February 17, 1962. He served as Chief Judge from 1972 to 1980. His service was terminated on December 31, 2000, due to his retirement. He was the last federal court judge in active service to have been appointed by President Kennedy. He died on June 27, 2006, in Columbus. Notable cases In his first year on the bench, Elliott issued an order halting a civil rights demonstration led by the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. in Albany, Georgia. He later said that the decision — subsequently overturned on appeal — was made due to a threat of violence against Rev. King and his supporters. But King biographer Taylor Branch wrote that Judge Elliott was a \\"strident segregationist.\\" In 1974, Elliott gained notoriety for overturning the conviction of Army Lt. William Calley for killing 22 people during the 1968 My Lai massacre, a decision later overruled by the appeals court. In his later years, Elliott was rebuked by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals for his decisions in cases where defendants failed to produce requested evidence to the Court's satisfaction.

The first Chebyshev function or is given by :\\\\vartheta(x)=\\\\sum_{p\\\\le x} \\\\log p with the sum extending over all prime numbers that are less than or equal to . The second Chebyshev function is defined similarly, with the sum extending over all prime powers not exceeding : \\\\psi(x) = \\\\sum_{k\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}}\\\\sum_{p^k\\\\le x}\\\\log p=\\\\sum_{n \\\\leq x} \\\\Lambda(n) = \\\\sum_{p\\\\le x}\\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\log_p x\\\\right\\\\rfloor\\\\log p, where is the von Mangoldt function. The Chebyshev functions, especially the second one , are often used in proofs related to prime numbers, because it is typically simpler to work with them than with the prime-counting function, (See the exact formula, below.) Both Chebyshev functions are asymptotic to , a statement equivalent to the prime number theorem. Both functions are named in honour of Pafnuty Chebyshev. Relationships The second Chebyshev function can be seen to be related to the first by writing it as :\\\\psi(x)=\\\\sum_{p\\\\le x}k \\\\log p where is the unique integer such that and . The values of are given in . A more direct relationship is given by :\\\\psi(x)=\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\vartheta \\\\left(x^\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right). Note that this last sum has only a finite number of non-vanishing terms, as :\\\\vartheta \\\\left(x^\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right) = 0\\\\quad \\\\text{for}\\\\quad n>\\\\log_2 x\\\\ = \\\\frac{\\\\log x}{\\\\log 2}. The second Chebyshev function is the logarithm of the least common multiple of the integers from 1 to . :\\\\operatorname{lcm}(1,2,\\\\dots, n)=e^{\\\\psi(n)}. Values of for the integer variable is given at . Asymptotics and bounds The following bounds are known for the Chebyshev functions: (in these formulas is the th prime number , , etc.) :\\\\begin{align} \\\\vartheta(p_k)&\\\\ge k\\\\left( \\\\ln k+\\\\ln\\\\ln k-1+\\\\frac{\\\\ln\\\\ln k-2.050735}{\\\\ln k}\\\\right)&& \\\\text{for }k\\\\ge10^{11}, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8px] \\\\vartheta(p_k)&\\\\le k\\\\left( \\\\ln k+\\\\ln\\\\ln k-1+\\\\frac{\\\\ln\\\\ln k-2}{\\\\ln k}\\\\right)&& \\\\text{for }k \\\\ge 198, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8px] \\\\vartheta(x)-x&\\\\le0.006788\\\\frac{x}{\\\\ln x}&& \\\\text{for }x \\\\ge 10\\\\,544\\\\,111, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8px] \\\\psi(x)-x&\\\\le0.006409\\\\frac{x}{\\\\ln x}&& \\\\text{for } x \\\\ge e^{22},\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8px] 0.9999\\\\sqrt x&<\\\\psi(x)-\\\\vartheta(x)<1.00007\\\\sqrt x+1.78\\\\sqrt[3]x&& \\\\text{for }x\\\\ge121. \\\\end{align} Furthermore, under the Riemann hypothesis, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\vartheta(x)-x&=O\\\\left(x^{\\\\frac12+\\\\varepsilon}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi(x)-x&=O\\\\left(x^{\\\\frac12+\\\\varepsilon}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} for any . Upper bounds exist for both and such that, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\vartheta(x)&<1.000028x \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi(x)&<1.03883x \\\\end{align} for any . An explanation of the constant 1.03883 is given at . The exact formula In 1895, Hans Carl Friedrich von Mangoldt proved an explicit expression for as a sum over the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function: : \\\\psi_0(x) = x - \\\\sum_{\\\\rho} \\\\frac{x^{\\\\rho}}{\\\\rho} - \\\\frac{\\\\zeta'(0)}{\\\\zeta(0)} - \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\log (1-x^{-2}). (The numerical value of is .) Here runs over the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function, and is the same as , except that at its jump discontinuities (the prime powers) it takes the value halfway between the values to the left and the right: : \\\\psi_0(x) = \\\\tfrac12\\\\left( \\\\sum_{n \\\\leq x} \\\\Lambda(n)+\\\\sum_{n < x} \\\\Lambda(n)\\\\right) =\\\\begin{cases} \\\\psi(x) - \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\Lambda(x) & x = 2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,13,16,\\\\dots \\\\\\\\\\\\ [5px] \\\\psi(x) & \\\\mbox{otherwise.} \\\\end{cases} From the Taylor series for the logarithm, the last term in the explicit formula can be understood as a summation of over the trivial zeros of the zeta function, , i.e. : \\\\sum_{k=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{x^{-2k}}{-2k} = \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\log \\\\left( 1 - x^{-2} \\\\right). Similarly, the first term, , corresponds to the simple pole of the zeta function at 1. It being a pole rather than a zero accounts for the opposite sign of the term. Properties A theorem due to Erhard Schmidt states that, for some explicit positive constant , there are infinitely many natural numbers such that :\\\\psi(x)-x < -K\\\\sqrt{x} and infinitely many natural numbers such that :\\\\psi(x)-x > K\\\\sqrt{x}. In little- notation, one may write the above as :\\\\psi(x)-x e o\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{x}\\\\right). Hardy and Littlewood prove the stronger result, that :\\\\psi(x)-x e o\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{x}\\\\log\\\\log\\\\log x\\\\right). Relation to primorials The first Chebyshev function is the logarithm of the primorial of , denoted : :\\\\vartheta(x)=\\\\sum_{p\\\\le x} \\\\log p=\\\\log \\\\prod_{p\\\\le x} p = \\\\log \\\\left(x\\\\\\\\#\\\\right). This proves that the primorial is asymptotically equal to , where \\"\\" is the little- notation (see big notation) and together with the prime number theorem establishes the asymptotic behavior of . Relation to the prime-counting function The Chebyshev function can be related to the prime-counting function as follows. Define : \\\\Pi(x) = \\\\sum_{n \\\\leq x} \\\\frac{\\\\Lambda(n)}{\\\\log n}. Then : \\\\Pi(x) = \\\\sum_{n \\\\leq x} \\\\Lambda(n) \\\\int_n^x \\\\frac{dt}{t \\\\log^2 t} + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\log x} \\\\sum_{n \\\\leq x} \\\\Lambda(n) = \\\\int_2^x \\\\frac{\\\\psi(t)\\\\, dt}{t \\\\log^2 t} + \\\\frac{\\\\psi(x)}{\\\\log x}. The transition from to the prime-counting function, , is made through the equation : \\\\Pi(x) = \\\\pi(x) + \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\pi\\\\left(\\\\sqrt x\\\\right) + \\\\tfrac{1}{3} \\\\pi\\\\left(\\\\sqrt[3] x\\\\right) + \\\\cdots Certainly , so for the sake of approximation, this last relation can be recast in the form : \\\\pi(x) = \\\\Pi(x) + O\\\\left(\\\\sqrt x\\\\right). The Riemann hypothesis The Riemann hypothesis states that all nontrivial zeros of the zeta function have real part . In this case, , and it can be shown that : \\\\sum_{\\\\rho} \\\\frac{x^{\\\\rho}}{\\\\rho} = O\\\\left(\\\\sqrt x \\\\log^2 x\\\\right). By the above, this implies : \\\\pi(x) = \\\\operatorname{li}(x) + O\\\\left(\\\\sqrt x \\\\log x\\\\right). Good evidence that the hypothesis could be true comes from the fact proposed by Alain Connes and others, that if we differentiate the von Mangoldt formula with respect to we get . Manipulating, we have the \\"Trace formula\\" for the exponential of the Hamiltonian operator satisfying : \\\\left. \\\\zeta\\\\left(\\\\tfrac12+i \\\\hat H \\\\right)\\\\rightn \\\\ge \\\\zeta\\\\left(\\\\tfrac12+iE_{n}\\\\right)=0, and : \\\\sum_n e^{iu E_{n}}=Z(u) = e^\\\\frac{u}{2}-e^{-\\\\frac{u}{2}} \\\\frac{d\\\\psi _0}{du}-\\\\frac{e^\\\\frac{u}{2}}{e^{3u}-e^u} = \\\\operatorname{Tr}\\\\left(e^{iu\\\\hat H }\\\\right), where the \\"trigonometric sum\\" can be considered to be the trace of the operator (statistical mechanics) , which is only true if . Using the semiclassical approach the potential of satisfies: : \\\\frac{Z(u)u^\\\\frac12}{\\\\sqrt \\\\pi }\\\\sim \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{i \\\\left(uV(x)+ \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} \\\\right)}\\\\,dx with as . solution to this nonlinear integral equation can be obtained (among others) by :V^{-1} (x) \\\\approx \\\\sqrt {4\\\\pi}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{d^\\\\frac12}{dx^\\\\frac12} N(x) in order to obtain the inverse of the potential: : \\\\pi N(E) = \\\\operatorname{Arg} \\\\xi \\\\left(\\\\tfrac12+iE\\\\right).

The colliery areas have a rest house each and at the first of these a weekly bazar is held on Sundays. There are three caves in the rocky ground near Ghugus, one of which contains an idol of Bhairavdev with broken legs. The local tradition regarding this is that in former times while thefts and dacoities used to take place elsewhere, none could be committed at Ghugus, and consequently the thieves and dacoits cut off the legs of the idol. In front of this idol there is a stone standing erect called Bahi or the sleeve of Sita. Not far off there is another small cave containing a stone, which the people say is the mother of Bhairavdeva. The idol of Bhairavdeva was said to be increasing in height. Ghugus is now a coal mining town. The first colliery known as Mayo Colliery was opened in 1870 by Lord Mayo.

It is also referred to as Steel City of Punjab or \\"Loha Mandi\\" due to its large number of steel factories. History According to local knowledge (and authenticated by the Shiromani Gurudwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC)), the sixth Sikh Guru, Guru Hargobind, stayed along the bank of Lake Barhi Dhab for 40 days in 1646. He was accompanied by his followers and warriors. A skirmish developed between his men and a contingent of Mughal forces. Their weapons sustained damage. The Guru's men pleaded before him that they could not continue to fight, as there was no available steel in the area to repair their weapons. Guru Hargobind replied, : \\"Someday this place will be a large steel-producing center in the country. Why do you say no steel is available to repair your weapons?\\" Henceforth, Barhi Dhab was known as \\"Gobindgarh\\" as named after Guru Hargobind Ji. To date, a Gurudwara remains situated near the town's railway station to commemorate Guru Hargobind in his holy memory. Industrialization in Mandi Gobindgarh began at the start of the 20th century. In 1902, the Maharaja Hira Singh of Nabha, where Gobindgarh then lay, ordered the building of industrial units in the town. Maharaja Partap Singh conducted further industrial development. In 1928, Gobindgarh became a free trade zone for steel. As a center for steel, the town experienced growth. The land was made available to local blacksmiths at nominal rates in early 1940, leading to the establishment of a number of workshops on both sides of the G.T. Road at Gobindgarh. Mandi Gobindgarh began as a walled town with four gates, which neighbored Modi Mills, Munilal Om Prakash, the main post office (present to this day), and Krishna Mandir. All the gates were closed by sunset. In 1950, the gates were demolished. Demographics India census, Gobindgarh has a population of 55,416. Males constitute 56% of the population, while females 44%. Gobindgarh has an average literacy rate of 69%, considerably higher than the national average of 59.5% (72% for males and 67% for females). 12% of the population is under 6 years of age. Economy The economy of the town has been based primarily on steel and its allied industries. It has nearly 200 steel-rolling mills serving 25% of the secondary steel market of the country. There are approximately 48 induction furnaces producing raw material for the rolling mills, 12 forging units catering to the needs of the steel-rolling mills, sugar and paper industry, around 40 foundry units, 90 scrap-cutting units, and 12 oxygen plants catering to the local requirements of the industry. In addition, there are another 67 industrial units associated with the steel industry. There is a vibrant trading community that ensures steel products manufactured are sold throughout India. The most famous lead producing industry of Mandi Gobindgarh is New Power Metal and Alloy situated near Focal Point, Mandi Gobindgarh. The steel economy attracts workers from all of India, especially from Bihar, Delhi and U.P. Financial crisis from 2008 The industry of Mandi Gobindgarh was affected by the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent global recession. From 2012 to 2015, tax duties on imports and exports were increased, hurting profits of the Gobindgarh steel mills. Thousands of people became unemployed and were forced to return home after the closure of several factories within a short span of time.

It can be likened to speakers resorting to impromptu speech while reading from their prepared texts. Every carnatic concert has one or many music pieces that showcases the singer's prowess and intellect in the form of Manodharma sangeetham. It serves as an important and integral aspect of Carnatic music. Background Based out of Manodharma, Individual styles are developed. Manodharma has many aspects and performers develop distinct styles based on his/her musical values, interpretation and understanding. There is ample scope for manodharma when rendering raga alapana, tanam, neraval, pallavi, swaram and also kritis. The manodharma is cultivated after several years of constant learning, assimilating and experimenting with various forms of compositions like varnams, kritis, javalis, etc. and also by listening to consummate artistes. Manodharma plays such a significant role that a capable artiste may never render a raga the same way twice. To bring out the quintessence of a raga, one has to resort to the exclusive and distinct raga prayogas of the raga which are mostly taken from the 'set compositions' like varnams, kritis etc. Unless, these prayogas are brought out in the raga alapana, the identity of the ragam can seldom be established. For a beginner to identify a raga, these \\"exclusive\\" prayogas are of immense assistance. Keeping in mind, the \\"lakshana\\" (swarupa) of the raga, its jeeva swaras and also the special prayogas, the artistes develop the raga, weaving patterns after patterns, using various combinations of swaras. The caliber and finesse of a musician is often judged by his/her ability to bring out the excellence of a raga. Many musicians of the recent past, such as G. N. Balasubramaniam, Madurai Mani Iyer, Rajarathnam Pillai, Karukurichi Arunachalam, excelled in their application of manodharma bringing in many a sweet combination of notes of melodies, while limiting themselves to the confines of the raga concerned, embellishing the raga with their ability to produce melodic prayogas.

Gauchar is situated on the left bank of river Alaknanda and is en route to the celebrated holy destination of Badrinath. It is well known for being one of the cleanest place in country. It has previously topped Swachta sarvekshan best ganga town award. Situated at an altitude of above the sea level, Gauchar is surrounded by seven mountains. Gauchar is well known for its historic trade fair and airstrip. Gauchar town known for its great work to curb loss of lives in 2013 flood disaster of Uttarakhand. This town is unique in terms of its geographical location and topography. Gauchar is located on one of the largest pieces of flatland in this mountainous region of Uttarakhand. Education institution in Gauchar includes a beautiful Kendriya Vidyalaya adjacent to the main playground. Geography Gauchar is located at . History Nature has endowed Gauchar with a large flat area, one of the largest such open spaces in the mountainous areas of Uttarakhand and this field has played a major role in its history. This field has served as an airstrip and played host to several dignitaries in the past. It has also been the venue of one of the largest trade fairs in the area. This flat land was the property of the Panwar kings of Garhwal and it was donated by them to the Badrinath Temple at some point in history. It still belongs to the Badrinath Temple and as such is not supposed to be used for agriculture or any other purpose. (Gauchar's new airstrip has come up on agricultural land as a result and also because a much larger area was needed for the strip and the administrative buildings.) Gauchar Town at night Gauchar first attained recognition in the 1920s when Lady Willingdon, wife of the then Viceroy of India landed here by air. Then, in 1938, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru along with his sister Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit also came here by air on the way to a personal visit to Badrinath. At that time cow dung used to be burnt on the field to gauge the direction of air currents! Since 1943, Gauchar has played host to one of the largest trade fairs in Uttarakhand. The Bhotias of Chamoli District, residing in the border regions of Garhwal Himalayas, are well known for their traditional expertise in making a range of woollen garments and materials, besides processing and colouring of wool. Before 1962, there was trans-border trade between India and former Tibet, and the import of wool was the major source of income for the Bhotia's woollens-based, indigenous cottage industry. But after 1962, trade was stopped due to conflicts between China and India. The Gauchar Mela served as huge market for the Bhotias to sell their ware including woollen products, precious jewels and heeng (asafoetida), and to buy good for daily necessity such as cloth and salt to carry back with them. This fair was not merely a local fair, but people travelled here from as far as Bijnaur and Kotdwar to participate in the brisk trade. At a macro level, approximately 1000 AD to 1803, Gauchar – in common with the rest of Garhwal – was ruled by the Pal dynasty which later came to be known as the Shah dynasty. In 1803, taking advantage of the devastating earthquake that killed one-third of the region's population, the Gorkhas advanced towards Garhwal. Pradyuman Shah was the king at that time, and he lost his life and kingdom in the ensuing battle. In common with the rest of Garhwal, Gauchar came under Gorkha rule from 1803 to 1815. In 1815, the British who merged the eastern part of Alaknanda and Mandakini along with the capital Srinagar into British Garhwal. Initially, this area was administered from Dehradun and Saharanpur. However, later the British established a new district in this area and named it Pauri. Today's Chamoli – and Gauchar – was a tehsil of Pauri. On 24 February 1960, Tehsil Chamoli was upgraded to a new district in independent India's state of Uttar Pradesh. Gauchar became a Nagar Panchayat in 1994. Gauchar Mela Gauchar Mela of Uttarakhand Gauchar Mela of Uttarakhand is a great attraction for the local people and the traders and merchants from every corner of the state. Held every year on 14 November, Uttrakhand's Gaucher mela is fundamentally an industrial and traditional fair. It is attended widely by tourists and inhabitants (villagers people mostly) of the state alike. This fair hold two kinds of thems, in day time sports and evening time cultural programs by schools and state level artist. These are major attraction of Gauchar mela at Uttarakhand. Gauchar Mela in Uttarakhand was first organized in 1943 and has since taken place every year on the same dates. Trade between India and Tibet was open at that time. On this side, the trade was largely carried out by the Bhotias, who inhabit the frontiers of Chamoli Garhwal, bordering Tibet. But these high-altitude regions were covered with snow throughout winter, and the inhabitants used to migrate to lower altitudes for six months. The Gauchar Mela at Uttarakhand helped the Bhotias to sell their woolen handicrafts and buy the raw materials for the next summer trade across the borders. It was not only a local fair; people from across north India, especially, Uttar Pradesh, attended it. After India's independence, Gauchar Mela is being organized by the government as a developmental, industrial, and cultural fair. It is considered as one of the major fairs in the region for promotion of trade and culture. All the state government departments participate in this annual event, which is a platform to showcase modern agricultural methods.

Eisenhower. Intended to be worn on its own or as an insulating layer beneath the M-1943 Field Jacket, it featured a pleated back, adjustable waist band, fly-front buttons, bellows chest pockets, slash side pockets, and shoulder straps. Background All-purpose service coat issued to enlisted soldiers at the onset of World War II Until the late 1930s, the United States Army’s field uniform consisted of a wool flannel shirt, matching trousers, a mid-hip-length \\"all-purpose service coat\\" and wool overcoat. Save for its belted waist, the single-breasted service coat resembled a suit or sport coat. Little changed since the mid-1920s, it featured notched lapels and four metal buttons from its open collar to its belted waist. Made of wool fabric, it touted two flapped and button-through patch pockets at the breast and two identically styled patch pockets below its waist – its four pockets either box-pleated or bellows-styled-pleats. M-41 Field Jacket or \\"Parsons' Jacket\\". Finding the service coat to be impractical for field use, the army began a four-year study in 1935 to develop a more practical and effective combat jacket to replace the service coat. The service coat was relegated to garrison and parade duty, and the enlisted soldiers' version was simplified to eliminate the belt. In 1940, it first adopted the first pattern field jacket, the \\"Parsons jacket\\" named for Major General James K. Parsons who helped with its development. This was quickly followed by an updated pattern, using the same nomenclature. Simply designed and modeled after a civilian windbreaker made by John Rissman & Sons of Chicago, it was a short, button-front weatherproof jacket with a tight fitting waist and two flapped and button- through front pockets. M-43 field jacket By 1943, front-line skirmishes in North Africa and Europe proved the Parsons jacket insufficient and it was replaced by a completely redesigned field jacket. Built around the layering principle, the M-1943 became the basic building block of a multi-environment, all-season combat uniform being developed by the Office of the Quartermaster General (OQMG) for worldwide combat. The Air Transport Command (ATC) recommended development of a waist-length wool field jacket that could be worn under the M-1943 jacket as an added insulating layer. During autumn 1943, the Army Air Corps' prototype jacket was sent to Chief Quartermaster of the European Theater of Operations for review and possible adoption by ETO commanding general, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Eisenhower had already requested a waist-cropped style stemming from his appreciation of the functionality of the British Battle Dress jacket. According to Carlo D’Este in his book, “Eisenhower: A Soldier’s Life” (citing an eyewitness account by James Parton) while visiting the VII Bomber Command in England in 1942, Eisenhower openly admired a uniform jacket worn by Major General Ira C. Eaker which Eaker had specially made by a London tailor modeled loosely after the standard dress of the British armed forces. Eaker gave Eisenhower the jacket, which fit Eisenhower. Thereafter Eisenhower had similar jackets made in the same style. D’Este credits Eaker for actually creating the Eisenhower jacket. Design and construction Eisenhower, wearing his M44 jacket, with some Allied commanders following the signing of the German Instrument of Surrender at Reims. The M-44 jacket that emerged was waist-length, and made of olive drab 18-ounce wool serge. It featured notched lapels, a closable \\"storm collar\\", snag-free fly front buttons and flapped, bellows breast pockets, shoulder straps for gear retention, and roomy sleeves to accommodate insulating layers. Staggered cuff buttons adjusted for layering or allowed a loose fit in warmer conditions, as did adjustable waist buckles. A pair of \\"action-back\\" pleats extended from shoulder to waistband, providing freedom of movement with a slim fit. Intended to be worn on its own or underneath the M-43, the \\"Ike jacket\\", was classified standard issue in November 1944, and additionally designated as the Army’s dress and parade uniform. According to Paul Fussell’s Uniforms, \\"Eisenhower had a reputation among his troops as an eminently decent man, friendly and sympathetic\\", an admiration that Ike elevated even further, tells Fussell, by having the bravado to casually rest his hands inside his pocket and \\"violate the sacred Army injunction.\\" That anecdote, Fussell says, explains why Eisenhower refused to adorn his personal jacket with gilded buttons: He considered his jacket an every-warrior’s combat uniform. Eisenhower died in 1969 and was buried dressed in his famous short green jacket. US Marine Corps and the \\"Vandegrift jacket\\" Following the Guadalcanal Campaign, the 1st Marine Division under Major General Alexander Vandegrift were posted to the cooler climate of Melbourne, Australia. As the Marines only had their utility and tan summer uniforms, they were issued Australian army battle dress with the Marines calling the short jacket the \\"Vandegrift jacket\\". An American-made, forest green version was issued to officers in December 1944 and to enlisted Marines in August 1945.p.31 Rottman, Gordon L.

Fisher wearing the Border Patrol's version of the Ike Jacket with peaked lapel In 1947, the Army introduced a more closely tailored version of the Eisenhower jacket which was designated solely as a dress and parade uniform; the jacket was again modified in 1950 without button cuffs. With the later introduction of the \\"Army green\\" service uniform in 1957, the Ike jacket gradually began to disappear domestically but was still a uniform option for troops stationed in international theaters. In 1949, the United States Air Force (USAF), which had been spun off as a separate service in 1947, included an Eisenhower jacket in its new \\"Air Force blue\\" uniform color; it remained in use by the USAF until being retired in 1964.United States Air Force Dress Ike Jacket Thanks to its greater comfort and the unobstructed ease it offered while operating a vehicle or brandishing a side-arm, the Ike jacket design became a popular post-WWII uniform staple among Federal and state law enforcement agencies as well as with countless numbers of municipal and civilian police departments throughout the United States. To this day, uniforms of the U.S. Border Patrol, along with most allied agencies within its broader, umbrella department, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency (USCBPA) and the National Park Service (NPS) have a dress jacket that is nearly identical to the original Ike jacket.

Mythological significance  During the great war of Ramayana in Treta Yuga Ravana pleased Lord Shiva with his penance so that he could win the war against Lord Rama. Lord Shiva took the shape of a Shiv-ling and directed him to install that Shiva-ling in Lanka. But Lord Shiva proposed the condition that Shiv-Ling should not be put on the Earth on its way to Lanka. But on the way back, Ravana had to give the Shiva-ling to a shepherd to attend nature's call. Shiva increased the weight of the Shiva-ling, so the shepherd had to give up and put the Ling on the ground. This made Ravana very angry as he understood the trickery of Lord Shiva. Ravana realised that Lord Shiva did not want the Ling to be carried to Lanka and let Ravana win the war. Enraged Ravana pressed the Ling with his thumb resulting in an impression which looked like a cow's ear (गौ-कर्ण). It is on this basis that the place was named Gola Gokaran Nath.

People of this town organize a week-long fair in Railway Football Ground starting from 11 March every year in remembrance of the assassinated 'Labour Leader' Sadanand Jha. There are two big playgrounds in Gomoh.  Geography  Location Gomoh is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Gomoh It has an average elevation of 245 metres (803 feet). Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the area. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. Gomoh is a largely dust-free area (unlike its polluted surroundings owing to numerous coal mines) surrounded by hills. Overview The region shown in the map lies to the north of Dhanbad city and is an extensive rural area with villages (particulalrly in the northern areas) scattered around hills. One of the many spurs of Pareshnath Hill (1,365.50 m), situated in neighbouring Giridih district, passes through the Topchanchi and Tundi areas of the district. The Barakar River flows along the northern boundary. The region shown in the map covers several CD blocks – Topchanchi, Govindpur, Tundi, Purbi Tundi and a small part of Baghmara. The Kolkata-Agra National Highway 19 (old number NH 2)/ Grand Trunk Road cuts across the southern part of the region.  Demographics  As per the 2011 Census of India, Gomoh had a total population of 31,495 of which 16,443 (52%) were males and 15,052 (48%) were females. Population below 6 years was 3,956. The total number of literates in Gomoh was 23,233 (84.36% of the population over 6 years). India census, Gomoh had a population of 28,576. Males constitute 54% of the population and females 46%. Gomoh has an average literacy rate of 70%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 78%, and female literacy is 60%. In Gomoh, 14% of the population is under 6 years of age.  Social structure  Gomoh consists of people from diverse religious and professional backgrounds. The major role in development of Gomoh was of Netaji. For the peoples living in Gomoh there are many problems like lack of education, worst electricity supply and many more. Religious diversity is the hallmark of Gomoh. A number of Anglo-Indians can be found here since the British era as a result of which Christians are here from a long time. The Sikh community settled here before Independence as businessmen. A gurudwara at Loco Bazar is visited by many Sikhs from surrounding areas every day. Bengalis form a large part of the population and have contributed largely to the culture of this place. However, their population has been dwindling for the last few decades. On Durga Puja one can get a glimpse of Kolkata in Gomoh, especially at Durga Para, which is home to the oldest Durge Puja in the area. Muslims also contribute substantially to the population and culture of this region. There is also a masjid and a madarsa at Purana Bazar and a Jama Masjid at Loco Bazar. Id-Gah and graveyard of Muslims is in Laludih area. A majority of the people are railway employees (different grades) since Gomoh is a railway-based town. These people do not belong to the city but got transferred from different parts of the country. After retirement, a good number of these employees choose to settle down in Gomoh giving rise to the population of the city. There is a strong business class also in Gomoh. Businesses ranging from food grain wholesaling to clothing and apparel to building material (cement, bricks, iron rods, etc.) to confectionery and bakery products etc. can be found. Though Marwaris are dominating the business scenario, one can find the representation of all the religious groups. Some people are also engaged in agriculture, growing certain cereals and vegetables. Main festivals celebrated include Durga Puja (Dussehra), Dipawali, Holi, Chatth Puja, Id, Gurunanak Birthday, and Christmas. Infrastructure Gomoh has an area of 8.96 km2. It is 37 km from the district headquarters Dhanbad. It has a railway station. Buses are available in the town. It has 50 km roads and both open and closed drains. The two major sources of protected water supply are hand pumps and tap water from treated source. There are 5,313 domestic electric connections and 60 road lighting points. Amongst the medical facilities it has 1 hospital with 30 beds and 12 medicine shops. Amongst the educational facilities, it has 17 primary schools, 13 middle schools, 9 secondary schools, 1 senior secondary school and 1 general degree college. Amongst the recreational and cultural facilities, it has 2 cinema theatres and 1 auditorium/ community hall. It has the branch offices of 3 nationalised banks, 1 cooperative bank and 1 agricultural credit society.  Education  As Gomoh is a small town, only a few educational institutes up to the Secondary level exist. Notable among them is The Kendriya Vidyalaya Gomoh (K.V. Gomoh) which is a school managed by the Railways. There are some more CBSE schools up to Standard X such as Blossom Public School and Guru Nanak Public School , Sarswati Shishu Vidya Mandir and the St. Mary's day school . There are other high schools which are affiliated to Jharkhand Academic Council(JAC) i.e. Azaad Hind High School, Bishop Rockey High School & St. John de Brito High School. Girls High School is an all- female school. Perhaps this is why female literacy is higher here than in many prominent cities of Jharkhand and than the national female literacy rate. Pandit Nehru Memorial (PNM) College caters to graduation level studies. However, these facilities are not sufficient since students have started taking up various specialized courses in diversified fields. For all such advanced courses students from this area either depend on Bokaro Steel City (33 km) or Dhanbad (20 km) or go to any metro city. Many students have shown their thread of talent in Olympics, National-level sports, quiz and talent shows. Many youngsters from this place have even participated in various events abroad. For junior kids, a good school exists at Jeetpur, Nurture kindergarten Play School. Healthcare Healthcare facilities are also grossly inadequate. Even to this date Gomoh lacks a good doctor as well as a nursing home. Though there are some government and private nursing homes, they fail to provide even the most basic treatment. The medical units operating in the area are: # PHC Gomoh at Jitpur # Railway Hospital (set up by railways for its employees, they also cater to non-railway patients unofficially) # A few other privately run small clinics  References  Cities and towns in Dhanbad district ","title":"Gomoh"},{"id":"5793849","text":"Beatrice Nicoleta Câșlaru (also Coadă, born 20 August 1975 in Brăila) is a former medley swimmer from Romania, who competed in three consequentive Summer Olympics for her native country, starting in 1996.

Habel in the icefield. The Peyto Glacier is situated in the Canadian Rockies in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada, approximately northwest of the town of Banff, and can be accessed from the Icefields Parkway. Peyto Glacier is an outflow glacier from the Wapta Icefield, which rests along the Continental divide. The glacier snout is subject to high melt rates from season to season and there is marked surface lowering on several parts of the glacier. Glacial silt, which is carried from the glacier by streams, ensures a turquoise appearance to Peyto Lake, a popular touring destination. As is true for the vast majority of glaciers worldwide, Peyto Glacier has been retreating rapidly, especially since the last half of the 20th century, and has reportedly lost 70% of its mass since it was first researched (Demuth and Keller, 2006). Between 1896 and 1966, the total volume loss of the Peyto Glacier was 1088.5 x 106 m3 (Wallace, 1995). In 1987, an automatic weather station was constructed near the glacier that monitors temperature changes, radiation and precipitation.

It ran from 1987 to 1991 on Showtime in the United States and the Global Television Network in Canada. The character made his first appearance on the 1972 TV series The John Byner Comedy Hour. Einstein then regularly played the character on the short-lived 1976 variety series Van Dyke and Company, starring Dick Van Dyke. Einstein revived the character for the 1980-1986 sketch comedy series Bizarre, which spun off his own series in 1987. After the last season, Einstein won a 1992 CableAce Award for Best Actor in a Comedy Series. An animated spinoff, Super Dave: Daredevil for Hire, aired for one season on Fox TV from 1992 to 1993. The show Super Dave took place in a theater with an audience. The stage featured his signature \\"bulb wall\\" - a movable wall lined with red, white and blue light bulbs, which would act as a curtain. He would often do an introductory monologue, and introduce guest performers there. The studio was located at the fictional \\"Super Dave Compound\\" - a combination resort/theme park/learning center/etc. (anything needed for a particular episode). In the first season, in 1987, the compound was often referred to as the \\"stunt compound\\" or \\"Super Dave Complex\\". In the second season, the show moved to a different studio. It featured the same stage setup - the bulb wall and the billboard sign behind it; however, the studio was much larger. In the original studio, the stage was at the lowest point in the studio and was surrounded by a semicircle of bleacher-style seats (It was the same studio where Bizarre was taped, the Glen Warren Studios at CFTO-TV in the Toronto suburb of Scarborough.). The new studio was a typical theater with a raised stage, a balcony of seating and private boxes. This was the Markham Theatre in Markham, Ontario. Super Dave's personal \\"racetrack\\" (where he drove a \\"specialized\\" race car and crashed) was the Riverside International Raceway in Moreno Valley, California, and you can see the name Riverside International Raceway and Winston Western 500 on the wall at turn 9https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trvuRn0mMw0. A typical episode consisted of a teaser scene of Super Dave outside the studio, often somewhere else within his compound; his theme and introduction in the studio, usually featuring one or more artistic performances; followed by another remote scene, usually a stunt. Musical guests on the show included Ray Charles, Celine Dion, Doug and the Slugs, k.d. lang, Jerry Lee Lewis, Colin James, Bobby McFerrin, Kenny Rogers, and Sonny Bono. Other types of performances were also featured, including ventriloquist Ronn Lucas, ventriloquist Jeff Dunham, impressionist André- Philippe Gagnon, comedian Steve Allen, talk show host Regis Philbin, and the Smothers Brothers, whose variety show Einstein got his start writing for. Besides simply bringing performers onstage normally, a false reason was often given for the performer's appearance - for instance, they might be introduced as a member of the show or compound's staff that Super Dave would allow to perform, or an audience member who suddenly revealed a talent. When a performer was introduced with such a fake background story, Super Dave would often go to thank the performer after a short simple performance, only to have them continue with a more elaborate performance before he could do so; this would repeat several times. Super Dave's signature was to perform outrageous daredevil stunts which invariably went awry and resulted in his grievous injury - usually at the end of an episode. These included such things as riding inside the hub of a giant yo-yo suspended from a crane (the yo-yo broke free of its string and rolled off a cliff into a ravine) and being flung inside a giant football (the catapult malfunctioned and \\"spiked\\" the football instead of throwing it). After an injury occurred, Super Dave would usually appear torn apart, stretched, or otherwise injured. One of his signature logos is a drawing of his head (in a helmet or his baseball cap) on top of a pair of shoes with no body. This was occasionally how he appeared after a stunt resulted in something falling on top of him. The compound concept was explored as the seasons went on, and he would increasingly forgo a stunt in order to demonstrate a new feature of the compound, or a new piece of technology they were working on at the compound. These demonstrations would usually have the same results as his stunts, and he would be injured. Sometimes he planned to go to a stunt, but ran out of time, and would be injured in some other way. There were rare episodes in which he had been injured before the show began, and was already in the hospital, or in which he was not injured at all. Recurring characters Super Dave was accompanied by several recurring characters including: * Mike Walden, Super Dave's announcer, whose loud suits were frequently the subject of mockery. He was almost always present in the remote segments. Walden would often say \\"Get that thing out of here!\\" after a failed stunt using dangerous machinery. * Fuji Hakayito (Art Irizawa), Super Dave's barely comprehensible stunt coordinator. * Donald Glanz (Don Lake), the manager of the Super Dave Compound. * A Trinidadian steel drum band led by Pan Man (Pat McNeilly) that only knew how to play Barry Manilow's song \\"Copacabana\\". They were always sent as a replacement for The Super Dave Band, who were unable to appear on the show when scheduled, usually due to a bar mitzvah (making them unseen characters). The Super Dave Band reportedly had a vast repertoire, which was featured in a game where audience members would try to stump the band by naming songs they would have to play. The steel drum band's leader would confirm they knew the song, but then play \\"Copacabana\\", frustrating Super Dave. A similar bit was \\"Name That Song\\", where the audience members would have to name a song played by the band. * Michel Lauzière, a supposed backstage worker who often came on to the stage unannounced to do an interesting performance or magic trick, much to the chagrin of Super Dave. After being told not to come back until he had something \\"unique\\", he would usually return seconds later with a different trick. * Robert Gruenberg, an unfortunate resident of the \\"Super Dave Confidence Building Area\\", where subjects are interred in underground chambers to overcome their fears. He is afraid to juggle bowling pins due to stage fright, but amazingly is able to juggle more dangerous items such as chainsaws and machetes. After he does so, he sadly states that he still cannot juggle pins, which leads to him being locked back underground. * Bernie Weinthal, Super Dave's midget attorney. * Tony Cox, the president of the network, who always ended up getting Super Dave irritated somehow. * Danny Menendez, a seldom seen camera man who is often mentioned by Super Dave. Running gags * An early joke that appears to have been abandoned was Mike Walden mispronouncing Fuji's surname differently every time he mentioned him. As a later gag, Walden is unable to understand Fuji's explanations of stunts, though, despite his heavy accent, the explanations are quite understandable. * Mike Walden would often comment that safety equipment included \\"genuine Saskatchewan seal-skin bindings\\" (even though Saskatchewan is landlocked). * The stunts/injuries were usually done with the use of dummies, and Super Dave would often do overdubs both during and after the stunt. * Super Dave would often ask for help, requests which Mike, Donald, and Fuji usually ignored or misunderstood, and leave him alone injured. If they did realize he was hurt, their attempts to help him would usually result in further injury. * Super Dave would often overdub a \\"goodnight\\" speech while waiting injured. * Super Dave would often comment on his associates' incompetence; he would often refer to Mike Walden as a \\"putz\\". Every now and then, he would swear, but it was always bleeped out with a duck's quack or a horn honk, both from Bizarre. * Super Dave did utter \\"Holy Chim\\" in reaction to sudden pain from stunts starting to go wrong, like his barefoot firewalking stunt, which he collapsed at the end of, after yelling \\"Holy S\\" * Scenes would often continue after the characters believed the cameras were turned off. * Super Dave would often be hit or run over by a vehicle, even when the sequence had nothing to do with them, and often including ambulances after he had already been hurt. * Some of Super Dave's common catchphrases on the show included noting that something great would \\"knock your socks off\\", and exclaiming \\"new pain!\\" or \\"no pain!\\" when he was being injured. * Super Dave was often portrayed as self-serving, especially in scenes where he believed he was off-camera. * The show was often said to be running late, and Super Dave would often chide people for wasting time. * When naming famous people or other two-word proper names, Super Dave often mistakes one of the names and is corrected by Mike or someone near him, though he seems not to notice. For example, \\"tennis great Johnny Connors\\", corrected quickly by Mike to \\"Jimmy\\". * Super Dave was often presented with honors and awards, and then reminded his staff that he did not like to be embarrassed by doing so on the air. He would often receive a trophy, say how much it meant to him, then casually toss it away. * Super Dave would usually arrive at his stunt and tour segments in a vehicle, often with Donald or Fuji, to a waiting Mike Walden. He would sometimes arrive in unique vehicles including a personal hovercraft and an amphibious car. * Super Dave would often respond to critics in a disreputable or trashy news source; he would often reveal the name of the source, a reputable source such as 60 Minutes. * Many Super Dave commercial products were shown, and some were shown to have inflated prices. * Other services at the Super Dave Compound were shown to have inflated prices. * He would often invite audience members to participate in contests where they would be winning until the last question, and then be faced with an impossible final requirement, and lose a big prize in favor of Super Dave hats and shirts. * If Fuji was being exceptionally annoying, Super Dave would usually hand Fuji a small dumbbell, asking him \\"Here, hold this\\". Upon grabbing the dumbbell, Fuji would promptly fall to the floor due to its weight. * Donald is frequently stated to be celebrating a special event in his life, be it a promotion, a special award, or the birth of one of his children. On-air promotion Weekly 30-second promos were produced by Showtime Networks to promote the series. The announcer was Doug Jeffers, who abandoned his typical breathy relaxed style for one that was more ringmaster-like in tone and emphasis. The music bed for each promo was a generic track called \\"Circus, Circus, Circus\\". The producer of the bulk of these promos was Steve Kolodny, who was given a yearly appearance on the show as \\"a film student who has produced a Super Dave music video\\". Syndication Reruns started airing on Comedy Gold on September 6, 2011. The show was dropped from its schedule in September 2015.

Known as the village of Rajputs, Gurha Slathian is located 30 km south of Jammu city in the Samba district of Jammu and Kashmir, India. It is the only village in Jammu and Kashmir whose population is above 4,600 (4,629 according to census in 2011). In 1975, 90% of the families had at least one member in the Indian Army. Gurha Slathian is more urban than surrounding villages with well-maintained double lane roads, Stadiums (playgrounds), hospitals, and schools. There are 8 wards in Gurha Slathia which may be referred to as \\"Mandi\\": Grota Mandi, Udh Mandi, Garh Mandi, Sani Mandi, Rajgarh Mandi, Paddar Mandi, Dabbar Mandi and Andrarh Mandi. The Slathias are Suryavanshi Rajputs that belong to Dogra region and are mainly found in Jammu, Samba and Udhampur. The Jamwal Clan has the following sub-clans formed by brothers of the reigning Maharajahs. They settled at various places around Jammu as Rajahs after they were allotted Jagirs. They are: Jandi Wala; Panjgrain Wala; Bhalwal Wala; Saruinsar Wala; Raipuria; Kahna Chak Wala; Panchor Wala; Jandria; Purani Mandi Wala; Sohal Wala; Agore Wala; Jagti Wala; Painthal wa Dansal Wala; Sahanu wa Taru Wala; Dalpatia; Narania; Shobilia; Birpuria; Balbadria; Ram Gharia; Fateh Khania; Tambar Dahojia; Manalia; Kapur Dyalia; Markalia; Ala Khania; Raduwal; Bahu Wala; Slathia;Surkhania; Dagoria; Jasrotia; Lakhanpuria; Samyal; Sangramia; Mankotia; Udhamolia Jamwalas; Chillhals; Deonias. History Slathia's Raja Hamir Dev ruled the Jammu kingdom between Bikarmi 1456 and Bikarmi 1483. He had two sons, Ajaib Dev and Hasil Dev. The younger son, Hasil Dev, became the Wazir of Raja Ajaib Dev of Jammu kingdom. Raja Ajaib Dev died in Bikarmi 1514, leaving the young Prince Beeram Dev behind in the care of his brother, Wazir Hasil Dev. Wazir Hasil Dev assisted the young prince with the administrative duties. Legend says that one day Badshah of Delhi, belonging to the Lodhi or Sadat dynasty, called Beeram Dev and, finding him very handsome, he offered him to marry his daughter who had fallen in love with the Raja of Jammu at first sight. Wazir Hasil Dev also accompanied Raja Beeram Dev. The Badshah ordered Raja Beeram Dev to baptize himself to Islam before the marriage but the Raja refused to change his religion although still agreed to marry Badsha’s daughter. The Badshah became furious at Raja Beeram Dev’s refusal to change the religion and after conferring with the Qadi ordered his killing. Atthis Wazir Hasil Dev came to Raja Beeram Dev’s rescue and asked the Badshah to hand the Raja to him for the said change and marriage to his (Badshah’s) daughter. Sensing the sensitiveness of the situation Wazir Hasil sent Raja Beeram Dev back to Jammu in the night along with a few sepoys. At this Badsah caught hold of Wazir Hasil Dev and ordered to kill him scrapping his skin alive. Then Badshah sent his forces to capture Raja Beeram Dev who was also killed later. Wazir Hasil Dev had two sons, Data Ram and Owali. The descendants of Data Ram got Jagir in Mangla (Manawar) and sobriquet as Mangalia Rajput. The descendants of the younger brother, Owali settled in village Gurha that was later named as Gurha Slathian and the descendants are known as Slathia Rajputs. Maharaja Gulab Singh later allotted Jagirs in Kashmir to Manglia Rajputs The Slathia community was also given Jagris in Kashmir and still few were given Jagir in Dada Seeba.

Characters  ;Kiko Himemaya : :Kiko is a four- year-old (five in the end of the series) girl who attends a private kindergarten in Tokyo. She is capable of doing many things most four-year-olds are not capable of; these include cooking, unassisted grocery shopping, limited acrobatics. Despite the title of the series, it is very rare to actually see Kiko smile and almost as rare for her to speak. Despite this, Kiko is quite popular with her classmates. She also has a wide variety of interests, including ballet, learning English, playing video games and interfering with her teacher's love life. ;Makiko and Tarou : (Mama) and (Papa) :Kiko's parents. Papa is a salaryman, Mama is a housewife, and both find their daughter a source of much puzzlement and frustration. Still they are devoted parents. ;Megumi-sensei : :Kiko's kindergarten teacher. She is twenty years old, and this is her first job out of teaching college. Kiko's eccentricities nearly make it her last, but Kiko is fond of her and turns her happiness into a personal project. Kiko also interferes with her love life, and helped her to find a boyfriend whom she married in the last episode. She hates carrots, to the point of fainting when she sees one. But carrots are her boyfriend's family's favourite food, so she often had to ask Kiko for help on the dates. She is extremely careless, even losing her wedding ring. ;Tenshi : :An angel who has come to Earth in the form of a black cat on a mission to spread happiness throughout the world. Unfortunately he is unable to communicate with humans (who hear his speech as cat noises), and even more unfortunately for him Kiko adopts him.

His nickname is Neko-chan. ;Tenshi's litters :They're named 'pa','pi','pu','pe',and 'po' by Kiko based on the only words that they can pronounce. They are also angels (even though Rosa, their mother, is just a regular cat), and they are able to use supernatural powers. Like normal kittens, they are mischievous and energetic, and they proved themselves to be smarter than Neko-chan, such as the time when Kiko wanted a hippo, Tenshi went to Africa by holding onto a plane, while the kittens just went to the local zoo. They like chocolate and are able to sing. ;Akuma : :A devil who is the Tenshi's rival and has come to Earth in the form of a siamese cat on a mission to spread chaos throughout the world.

The director is Dario Argento, and it based on a short story by F. Paul Wilson. The film is a story about supernaturally beautiful raccoon pelts (called \\"pine lights\\") that cause anyone who seeks to profit by them to commit horrendous acts. Meat Loaf stars as fur trader Jake Feldman, who finds these beautiful raccoon pelts and makes a coat out of them as a gift for the beautiful dancer Shanna (Ellen Ewusie), in order to fulfill his fantasy of sex with her. As a result, people end up committing brutal murders and suicides appropriate to their positions in relation to the pelts whenever around them.The Cult TV Book  Plot  Jake Feldman is a fur trader who desperately wants to have sex with a stripper named Shanna, who has no interest in him. One of his suppliers, Jeb Jameson and his son, go onto private land owned by an old woman known as \\"Mother Mater,\\" to trap animals. They find each trap containing a raccoon, and Jameson schools his son on the proper way to kill them: crush their windpipes with a boot, and if they survive, crush their skulls with a baseball bat. After processing, all of the raccoon pelts are perfect, and Jameson calls Feldman to arrange a sale. However, after Jameson goes to bed, his son Larry becomes mesmerized by the hanging furs, then pulls out the baseball bat and beats his father to death. Larry then opens a trap and sticks his face in, ripping it off. Feldman and his assistant arrive the next day to discover the beautiful pelts and both Jameson and his son dead. They steal the pelts and proceed to make a coat, which Feldman asks Shanna to model at the furriers expo. Inspired by his assistant, Feldman figures out where the Jamesons got the pelts by finding Jeb's map to Mother Mater's land, and visits Mother Mater to ask for a few raccoons to breed for fur. Mother Mater states the reason she warns people off her land is because the raccoons have taken up guardianship of the lost city's ruins on them. She rages and chases him off, screaming that they have not yet had their say. The fur trimmer, Sergio, disembowels himself with his scissors after cutting the pelts. The seamstress, Sue Chin Yao, sews her nose, eyes and mouth shut after finishing the coat, then suffocates. Feldman is only concerned that the coat is finished, and takes it to Shanna's apartment. She is entranced by the coat and eager to model it, but Feldman says he is still considering other models. Shanna sees this as a request for sex, and agrees. After they have sex, during which Shanna is wearing the fur coat, Feldman says he needs the bathroom and something sharp. Taking a knife with him, Feldman skins his own torso and creates a vest, bringing it out to Shanna. She panics and runs to the elevator, managing to take it down one floor before Feldman falls down the elevator shaft after her. She tries to escape, but Feldman grabs her leg and her hand is caught and crushed in the doors. Police find their bodies, and the film ends on one of the cops making a bloody footprint.  Themes  The story can be seen as a dark satire on the fur industry; the means of the victims' deaths all being based on what the furriers do to the racoons. This is unusual for a film by Dario Argento, since he normally avoids political overtones in his films.  DVD  The film was released on DVD on 13 February 2007. It was the nineteenth episode to air and the fourteenth to be released on DVD.

Miller (February 19, 1929 – November 25, 1992Per Social Security Death Index search on rootsweb. Retrieved November 21, 2010) was a broadcaster and television personality in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. Miller worked for Atlanta television station WXIA-TV (then known by call letters including WLWA-TV and WQXI-TV) from the 1950s to the 1970s.http://www.11alive.com/company/history/default.aspx His greatest exposure and notoriety came in the years following, for his role on the announcing team of professional wrestling programs broadcast on another Atlanta station, WTBS. Miller is best remembered by wrestling fans as Gordon Solie's co-host on Georgia Championship Wrestling, which was later renamed World Championship Wrestling. When Vince McMahon, Jr. bought GCW's time slot, Solie left the promotion to remain with Ole Anderson and his renamed Championship Wrestling from Georgia, but Miller stayed on until McMahon sold the promotion and time slot to Jim Crockett, Jr. of Jim Crockett Promotions. Miller conducted some interviews, but his primary duties were to announce upcoming house shows in the segue to commercial breaks, in much the same fashion as was done in the WWF at the time by Howard Finkel. McMahon also used Miller on his flagship show WWF Championship Wrestling for conducting backstage interviews into 1985. Miller is also remembered for his trademark phrase \\"Don't miss it...BEEE THERE\\" (emphasis intentional) when advertising upcoming house shows. He was also the subject of ribbing by the boys for his over-enthusiastic pronunciation of \\"STOOOOOBENVILLE OHIO\\", one of the stops on the Georgia circuit. During McMahon's ownership of Georgia Championship Wrestling, Miller served double duty as co-host of Gorilla Monsoon and as ring announcer for in-studio matches. On Black Saturday, July 14, 1984, Miller opened the program, and briefly described the new programming which would be offered through the WWF, then introduced McMahon. This moment has been featured on numerous WWE Home Video releases, most notably The Rise and Fall of WCW. Miller is also remembered as the host of Stars of Tomorrow and Dance Party – both locally produced shows which featured local talent. He also hosted local showings of horror films on WXIA's version of the Dialing for Dollars franchise. After leaving GCW, he retired as an on-air personality and later did voice-overs for WCW house shows into the 1990s.

It was intended to study the temporal and spatial distribution of the electron density, the electron temperature, the ion concentration, the ion mass, the micrometeorite distribution, and the micrometeorite mass in the ionosphere at altitudes between 400 and 1600 km and their variation from full sunlit conditions to full shadow, or nighttime, conditions. The payload was in the form of two truncated cones with the bases attached to a cylindrical equator. The outer shell was aluminum and had a diameter of 76 cm and a height of 76 cm. The 108.00 MHz transmitter had 100 mW average power, and it functioned for the life of the battery pack (54 days). The data system included telemetry consisting of continuous operation with real-time transmission. To avoid the possibility of effects on the experiments by asymmetrical charging on solar cell surfaces, solar cells were not used. Experiment instrumentation included an RF impedance probe, an ion current monitor, a retarding potential probe, a two-element and a three-element electron temperature probe, an electron current monitor, a photomultiplier-type and a microphone-type micrometeorite detector, an electric field meter, a solar horizon sensor, and thermistor temperature probes. Simultaneous measurements of electron and ion concentration were used to resolve the question of neutrality of the medium. Battery power failed on December 27, 1960. Considerable difficulty was encountered with decommutating the telemetered data to make machine processing possible. As a result of these difficulties, the data were mostly processed by hand. In spite of these difficulties, considerable new knowledge about the ionosphere was gained from operation of the satellite. Explorer 8 decayed from orbit on 28 March 2012.

It was active for over 200 years. The state is known to modern Chinese from the idiom, \\"Yelang thinks too highly of itself\\" (Yèláng zì dà).Wade, Geoff, \\"The Polity of Yelang and the Origin of the Name 'China'\\", Sino-Platonic Papers, No. 188, May 2009. Name The inhabitants of Yelang called themselves Zina. This may be source of the Sanskrit word Cīna (चीन). The English word China is derived from this Sanskrit word. Geography Expanse Situation map of Han dynasty in 2nd century BC; Yelang is shown in the southwest. The Yelang were believed to have been an alliance of agricultural tribes covering parts of modern-day Guizhou, Hunan, Sichuan and Yunnan. Location The ancient Chinese historian Sima Qian described Yelang located west of the Mimo and Dian, south of Qiongdu (in what is now southern Sichuan), and east of the nomadic Sui and Kunming. Some people have identified the seat of the kingdom as Bijie () in today's Liupanshui area, in modern Guizhou province, whilst others suggest the capital moved throughout the region over time. Culture Subsistence The Yelang were a primarily a confederation of agricultural farming tribes. Appearance and dress Yelang people wore their hair up and decorated themselves with jewellery such as bracelets and necklaces. Material culture Archaeologists have retrieved relics from Yelang graves including \\"bronze swords, U-shaped bronze hairclips, turquoise bracelets and jade necklaces\\", as well as \\"various bronze, porcelain and stone vessels visibly different from those belonging to other cultures studied in China, like the Han, Dian and Bashu cultures\\". Burial rites Tomb excavations show a unique burial custom in some Yelang tombs, in which the head of the deceased is placed into a bronze pot. This custom is unknown elsewhere in China. Military According to Chinese records the Yelang had strong armies. Government In 2007 a Miao man publicly disclosed his possession of an ancient seal, said to be that of the Yelang kingdom, and claimed to be the 75th descendant of the King of Yelang. Political Relations Nanyue Yelang had a close relationship with Nanyue (\\"Southern Yue\\") kingdom and used the Zangke River (now known as the Beipan River) as a means of inter-polity communications. The kingdom of Yelang declared their allegiance to Nanyue rule from the start of 183 BC until the end of 111 BC. The Yi people are possibly modern-day descendants of the Yelang kingdom.http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-GZMZ200501007.htm http://www.dictall.com/indu57/51/575155902FE.htm In Chinese culture Yelang is best known to modern Chinese because of an incident said to have occurred in the 120s BC. According to the story the king of Yelang, convinced that his kingdom was the greatest in all the world, inquired rhetorically of the Han emperor's envoy, \\"Which is greater, Yelang or Han?\\" This gave rise to the Chinese idiom, \\"Yelang thinks too highly of itself\\" (). Other sources suggest that Yelang's king was simply copying an earlier statement by a ruler of the adjacent Kingdom of Dian. Other Chinese sources describe the Yelang people as possessing supernatural powers.

Gudibande Fort was built by a yogi and a local chieftain called Byre Gowda some 400 odd years ago in the 17th century. It was believed that he belonged to the Tuluva dynasty of the Vijayanagar empire. It can be said as a concise replica of the Madhugiri fort. The fort has seven levels with interconnecting escape routes which would help soldiers to flee in case of emergency. On the top of the fort is a Shiva temple known as \\"Sir Rameshwara Temple\\", established by Sage Vishwamitra and Lord Rama which is believed to be one of the 108 Jyotirlingas . The strong pillar with a square base has well sculpted images. One can also have a good view of the Byrasagara reservoir. The fort’s main feature, is the rain water harvesting. It is said that there were around 19 rock ponds at different levels of the fort. However, the water channel system devised by Byre Gowda was said to be unique. Linking nineteen water bodies and tanks called dhones they could in all hold nearly 3 lakhs litres of rain water.  Byre Gowda  Byre Gowda was known as the “Havali” or menace among the rich.

The 18-span, concrete girder bridge carries road traffic, as well as a grade-separated pedestrian footpath and cycleway, across Wilfred Barrett Drive as part of the Central Coast Highway. The bridge is maintained by Roads & Maritime Services, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. History Opened in 1934, the inaugural Entrance Bridge was originally a wooden single lane bridge with bypass bays at intervals that allowed traffic travelling in the opposite direction to pass. The original bridge was adequate until 1965 as it only served traffic travelling as far as The Entrance North. Around 1955, the Number 11 bus operated by Red Bus Services crashed through a wooden retaining wall and landed in The Entrance Channel after its brakes failed while turning onto The Entrance Bridge. The driver and three passengers were uninjured, although the boat that the bus landed on was heavily damaged. In 1965, Wilfred Barret Drive was opened by the Deputy Premier, the Hon. Pat Hills. The road was named after Councillor Wilfred Barret who was a member of the first Wyong Shire Council. The road continues to be an important link between The Entrance and Toukley, passing through Wyrrabalong National Park. By the end of 1965 the bridge was dangerous and too costly to maintain. The traffic flow over the old bridge at The Entrance increased to such an extent the structure was under constant repair. Work began on the current two lane, concrete structure on 17 July 1967 after a successful tender by Transbridge Pty Ltd. The bridge was opened to traffic on 20 December 1968 and officially opened by the NSW Premier, the Hon. Robert Askin on 18 April 1969.

It has a membership of over 17,000 labourers; most of whom work for the United Bus Company of Tehran (Sharekat-e Vahed). Initially established in 1958, its activity has been intermittent throughout the years. The union gained notoriety after the 1979 Islamic Revolution after it openly engaged a regime that is often hostile towards independent worker organizations.  Background  Iran’s rapid industrialization under the rule of Iran’s final monarch, Mohammad Reza Shah, spawned many worker organizations, including the Syndicate. Labour movements in Iran have been influential participants in the country’s social and political transformation during the 21st century. Like many other sectors of Iranian society, labour unions participated in the 1979 Revolution that eventually led to the Shah’s exile and the inception of the ruling theocracy. Contrary to many of the political aspirations held by the Syndicate during the height of the revolutionary period, the union was placed in an evermore dire position by being banned from all activity. Being replaced by a state- sponsored Islamic Labour Council, bus operators lost the independent representation they once had. Operating in an underground capacity, the Syndicate had been relatively ineffective until their resurgence in 2004.  2004 resurgence  Because of the illegality of unions, the Syndicate maintained its network of workers through informal means. The latter half of 2004 symbolized a more organized Syndicate, giving it an aura of legitimacy not seen since its pre-1979 condition. Worker grievances once concealed by anti-union institutions, were now surfacing through the aid of union leaders such as Mansour Osanlou. After Osanlou was dismissed from the United Bus Company of Tehran along with seventeen other activists in mid-2005, the bus operators movement started to gain momentum. Osanlou’s popularity amongst workers and his charismatic appeal were important factors in making him the rallying point for alienated labourers. Worker disdain led to rumblings of strike action and revolt, but such thoughts were quelled by reactionary security forces organized by the company and the government itself. During one of the many engagements in May, Osanlou was taken into custody after being treated for injuries. He was later released. Pressure from the theocratic regime to dissolve future activities by the union was largely unsuccessful. An internal constitution was ratified by union executives on June 3, essentially cementing the efficacious role this organization would play in future disputes. 8,000 of the 17,000 workers participated in the election that led to the constitution’s approval. The notion of an established trade union was in direct conflict with the Islamic regime's labour policies. Incarceration for workers and their representatives within the Syndicate was a regular occurrence. Fighting against unpaid wages, hazardous working conditions, and the restriction of collective bargaining procedures (among others), placed the union in a morally superior position amongst workers. In a show of solidarity, bus operators left the lights on to their vehicles throughout their shifts in protesting the September 7 arrests of colleagues and union leaders. One of the latter, Mansour Osanlou, was sent to ward 209 of Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison. Osanlou’s calls for medical aid have been largely ignored by prison administrators. The biggest job action to result from this high-profile arrest came in the form of a planned demonstration on January 28, 2006. The demo never commenced because security forces were able to trace pervading pamphlets about the upcoming strike back to the Syndicate’s leadership. The union’s board of directors were arrested, essentially crippling the organizational framework of the impending job action. They included: Ebrahim Madadi, Mansour Hayat Ghaybi, Seyed Davoud Razavi, Sa’id Torabian, Ali Zad Hossein and Gholamreza Mirza’i. Aside from the detained union executives, hundreds of activists and strikers were also arrested (approximately 1200). Others have been detained in varying capacities. A couple dozen were said to have been released under strict conditions. They were excluded from organizing and/or participating in any strikes and other union activities. As a result, the crackdown attracted international attention. Along with widespread protests from worker and non-profit organizations across the world (Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, among others), the United States State Department also released a statement condemning the arrests. According to eyewitness accounts, Mansour Osanlou was arrested on Sunday, November 19, 2006 along with the vice-president of SWTSBC, Ibrahim Madadi under very suspicious circumstances. Osanlou and Madadi were beaten by a group of armed militia and were taken away after shots were fired into the air. This is his second arrest. Oslanou had been recently released on bail after being kept in solitary confinement for months. This seems to be another case where special police and state sponsored undercover militia of “Ansar-e Hezbollah” are used in arresting and silencing social and political activists. Osanlou was again released from detention, with the posting of additional bail money, on 19 December 2006. Another union officer who was arrested is Reza Shahabi, treasurer of the syndicate. Shahabi has been imprisoned since June 2010 in Evan prison and in 2012 was sentenced to six years imprisonment by the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran for “gathering and colluding against state security”, and “spreading propaganda against the system.”Document - Iran: Trade unionist given six-year prison sentence: Reza Shahabi Amnesty International9 May 2012 According to the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and other rights groups Shahabi’s state of health has deteriorated in custody, but prison authorities have not granted him appropriate medical treatment.IRAN: Trade unionist Reza Shahabi sentenced to six years of prisonInternational Federation for Human Rights (FIDH)19 April 2012]  2020  Rasoul Taleb Moghaddam, a member of syndicate of Tehran's bus drivers, received 74 lashes, the Syndicate of Tehran and Suburbs Bus Company Workers reported on 1 June 2020.

History Guskara railway station The area between the Damodar and Ajay was previously known as Gopbhum, where the Sadgope kings ruled for many centuries, before the advent of the Muslims. The Sur kings also occupy a somewhat mythical position in the region. Adi Sur of this dynasty is credited with having brought the five Brahmins and Kayasthas (two important upper castes in Bengal) from Kannauj in what is now Uttar Pradesh.Chattopadhyay, Akkori, pp. 150-151 Damage to embankments of the Ajay and consequent flooding was a regular problem in the Ausgram and Mangalkot area. The devastating flood of 1943 caused immense suffering and lead to a mass movement for restoration/repair of the embankments. A massive meeting was organized at Guskara in 1944, with Udaychand Mahtab, Maharaja of Bardhaman. However, the government did not take any action. Ultimately, the Communist Party, which had been at the forefront of agitations for some years, provided a huge workforce for the purpose and completed the repair work. That laid the foundation for the party’s popularity in the area.Chattopadhyay, Akkori, p. 482 Geography  Location Guskara is located at . It has an average elevation of 38 metres (125 feet).
