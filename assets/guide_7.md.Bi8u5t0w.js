Moreover, the species also in northern North America from Alaska and Qu√©bec across the United States to Wyoming. It is the only species in the family in northern Central Europe outside of the Alps. Alydus calcaratus is a large (10.0 to 12.0 mm), oblong and mainly blackish-coloured bug. The head is as wide as the pronotum, the rear corners of the pronotum are rounded. The hind leg (femora) of the males are thickened and have several strong spines on the underside. As with all the other species of the family (Alydidae), the antennae have four segments, of which the fourth is curved. The body is blackish, the dorsum of the abdomen has a bright orange patch, which is visible only in flight. They resemble spider-hunting wasps such as Arachnospila. Alydus calcaratus is phytophagous, the imagines and the nymphs feeding mostly on fallen seeds of various legumes (Fabaceae) especially species of the genera Sarothamnus, Cytisus, Genista and Ulex. Feeding on vertebrate carrion and faeces has also been observed. In Germany, imagines can be observed from the middle or end of June at the earliest, most occur in early August to mid-September, and the last observations are in October. The animals mate from July to September, nymphs were found from May to August. Information on the way of life of the nymphs is contradictory. The nymphs are said to live in ant nests but the nature of the relationship of the nymphs to ants is still unclear. The habitat is heaths, dry grassland, dry places with light soils and sand dunes.

Metallosphaera sedula can be roughly translated into ‚Äúmetal mobilizing sphere‚Äù with the word ‚Äúsedulus‚Äù meaning busy, describing its efficiency in mobilizing metals. M. sedula is a highly thermoacidophilic Archaean that is unusually tolerant of heavy metals. Significance Due to its ability to oxidize pyrite (FeS2), M. sedula has the potential to be used for coal depyritization. With increased awareness of the environmental impact of the combustion of coals, the idea of coal pollution mitigation or ‚Äúclean coal‚Äù was born. While there are several focuses of mitigation, one of which is the removal of impurities, such as sulfur found in pyrite, prior to combustion. The combustion of sulfur leads to the formation of SO2, which has adverse health effects, and contributes to acid rain. Abiotic removal of pyrite from coal is currently the preferred method, as opposed to biotic extraction via microorganisms; however, the process is feasible. Other organisms have been studied for the purpose of coal depyritization (for example, Thiobacillus ferrooxidans); however, the process occurs at a slower rate than traditional abiotic removal. M. sedula, being thermophilic, is tolerant of higher temperatures, which results in faster extraction rates than with other organisms, making it a strong candidate for future use in coal depyritization. Genome structure M. sedula contains a single, circular chromosome which is approximately 2.2 million base pairs in length. It encodes for approximately 2,300 proteins, some of which are necessary for metal tolerance and adhesion. The function for 35% of the proteins is currently unknown and for this reason they are called hypothetical proteins. Based on sequence comparisons, M. sedula is most closely related to members of the genus Sulfolobus. Cell structure, metabolism and life cycle M. sedula is a coccus, roughly 1 Œºm in diameter with pilus-like structures protruding from its surface when viewed via electron microscopy. That is an obligate aerobe that grows best at 75 ¬∞C and pH 2.0. The high level of physiological diversity it displays is relatively unique amongst extremophiles. It is capable of heterotrophic growth using complex organic molecules (with the exception of sugars), autotrophic growth by the fixation of carbon dioxide in the presence of H2 through a proposed modified 3-hydroxypropionate cycle, and its highest rates of growth are seen when grown mixotropically on casamino acids and metal sulfides. The dissimilatory oxidation of iron and sulfur in M. sedula, driven by its membrane oxidases, is key to the ability of M. sedula to mobilize metals and bioleach. When grown in the presence of H2, the ability of M. sedula to leach copper from chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), is reduced. Ecology M. sedula can be found in sulfur rich hot springs, volcanic fields, and acid mine drainage (AMD) communities. These communities are characterized by high metal ion concentrations, low pH and high temperatures. Though the dissolution of pyrite in AMD is a natural process, it is accelerated in the presence of acidophiles such as M. sedula that are found in these environments, leading to increased rates of acidification of water draining for active and abandoned mines. AMD communities are characterized by a diverse composition of microorganisms that fill available niches depending on their tolerance to temperature, metal resistance and pH. These communities display a complex symbiosis through the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur, iron, carbon and nitrogen. At high temperatures, M. sedula fills the niche of iron and sulfur oxidizer, a role that is filled by other acidophiles such as the mesophilic Ferroplasma spp. and Leptospirillum spp. at lower temperatures. M. sedula can also grow on meteorites in a lab. References #Huber, G. ,Spinnler, C. , Gambacorta , A., and Stetter, K. ‚ÄúMetallosphaera sedula gen. and sp. nov.

Specifically, the evolutionary history of coalitional aggression between groups of men may have resulted in sex-specific differences in the way outgroups are perceived, creating ingroup vs. outgroup tendencies that are still observable today. According to this hypothesis, intergroup conflict represents an opportunity for men to gain access to mates, territory, and increased status. As such, conflicts may have created selection pressures for psychological mechanisms in men to initiate intergroup aggression. In women, intergroup conflict substantially increases the risk of sexual assault by outgroup men, and may have created selection pressure for psychological mechanisms that bias women against outgroup men.  Overview   Violence and warfare  Violence and aggression are universal across human societies, and have likely been features of human behavior since prehistory. Archaeologists have found mass graves dating to the late Pleistocene and early Holocene that contain primarily male skeletons showing signs of blunt force trauma, indicating the cause of death was by weapons used in combat. Violence among humans occurs in distinct patterns, differing most obviously by sex. Ethnographic findings and modern crime data indicate that the majority of violence is both perpetrated by and targeted at males, and males are the most likely to be victims of violence. This male-male pattern of violence has been observed so repeatedly and in so many cultures that it may qualify as a human universal.  Tribal behavior  Men preparing for a raid. Humans are a social species with a long history of living in tribal groups. The psychological mechanisms that evolved to handle the complexities of group living have also created heuristics for quickly categorizing others as ingroup or outgroup members, with different behavioral strategies for each: treat ingroup members (those in one‚Äôs own group) favorably, and react to outgroup members (those who belong to a different group) with fear and aggression. These tendencies arise with little motivation, and have been provoked over superficial groups in lab studies‚Äîfor example, by showing paintings to participants and creating groups based on which painting participants prefer. Ingroup and outgroup preferences have also been observed in other social primates, such as the rhesus macaque. The male warrior hypothesis suggests that the ease with which individuals discriminate against members of other groups is an adaptation resulting from a long history of being threatened by outgroup males, who are in competition for resources.  Sex differences in parental investment  The MWH argues that the sex differences in attitudes towards outgroup members may be a result of the different reproductive strategies used by males and females‚Äîspecifically, the greater competition among males for mates. In mammals, males and females have distinct reproductive strategies based on the physiology of reproduction. Because females gestate, birth, feed, and invest more overall resources in each of their offspring, they are more selective with their mates but have greater certainty of being able to reproduce. Males, in contrast, can mate at a very low energetic cost once they have found a partner, but are only able to attract a female if they have physical or social characteristics that can be converted into resources‚Äîe.g., territory, food resources, status, power, or influence‚Äîor the strength and alliances to coerce females to mate. As a result, there is typically much greater variability in the reproductive success of males within a species and higher competition among males for mates. The strongest, best adapted, and most powerful males may have a harem, while less fit males never reproduce. For more details on this topic, see Trivers' theory of parental investment.  Male attitudes towards groups  The male warrior hypothesis predicts that because males may have historically remained in the groups in which they were born rather than moving away at adulthood (see patrilocality), they have a higher overall relatedness to their group than the female members, who would have moved to their new husbands‚Äô group upon marriage. Males may have a stronger interest in defending their group, and will be more likely to act aggressively towards outgroup males they encounter who may be attempting to steal resources or weaken the group with violence. For men at risk of never finding a mate, the fitness benefit to engaging in aggressive, violent behavior could outweigh the potential costs of fightings, especially if fighting alongside a coalition. Furthermore, the groups with more individuals who formed coalitions and acted altruistically to in-group members but aggressively to outgroup members would prosper (see multi-level selection).  Observational evidence/studies   Sex differences  Consistent with the expectations of the male warrior hypothesis, several studies have shown more ethnocentric and xenophobic beliefs and behaviors among men (compared to women), including the more frequent use of dehumanizing speech to describe outgroup members; stronger identification with their groups; greater cooperation when faced with competition from another group; a greater desire to engage in war when presented with images of attractive (but not unattractive) members of the opposite sex; greater overall rates of male-male competition and violence (as shown in violent crime and homicide statistics); and larger body size correlating with quicker anger responses. Studies have also tested the responses of women to outgroups, and have shown that women are most likely to fear outgroup males during the periovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, when fertility is at its peak. Women also have more negative responses around peak fertility when the males belong to an outgroup that the woman associates with physical formidability, even if the group was constructed in the lab. Overall, women who feel most at risk of sexual coercion are more likely to fear outgroup males, which aligns with the predictions of the MWH.  Non- human evidence  Coalitionary violence has also been observed in social species besides humans, including other primates. Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) males demonstrate similar violent behavior: groups of males form coalitions that patrol the borders of their territory and attack neighboring bands. Chimpanzees also have patrilocal living patterns, which aid with forming close coalitions, as all males are likely kin.  Prepared learning studies  In studies of prepared learning, conditioned fear responses to images of outgroup males were far more difficult to extinguish than conditioned fear responses to outgroup females or ingroup members of either sex, as measured by conductivity tests of perspiration on the skin. These results held true whether the participant was male or female. Because the neural circuitry for fear responses are more developed towards stimuli that have posed a larger threat for most of human history (snakes and spiders, for example, which were dangers frequently encountered by foragers), these findings suggest that outgroup males may have been more of a threat to physical safety than outgroup women or ingroup members, supporting the male warrior hypothesis.  Criticism/conflicting findings  While the male warrior hypothesis is supported by a number of experimental studies in neuroscience and social psychology, the effects of war and aggression on human psychology are still up for debate. General questions include: A) why are sex differences found in some laboratory experiments or field studies but not in others? (B) do females prefer warrior behavior in males regardless of its risk? and (C) is female sexual selection for male peacefulness also conceivable?

Text The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 22 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 72 (3rd/4th century) *Papyrus 81 (4th century; extant verses 1, 4‚Äì12). *Codex Vaticanus (325‚Äì350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330‚Äì360) *Codex Alexandrinus (400‚Äì440) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (c. 450; complete) *Papyrus 74 (7th century; extant verses 4‚Äì5) Old Testament references * : Psalm . * 1 Peter 3:14: Isaiah 8:12 Attitude to the family (3:1‚Äì7) Wives, just as slaves in the last part of chapter 2, were two vulnerable groups which is indirectly employed as examples of proper submission for Christians. However, 'Christianity gave dignity to the status of both', and here Peter teaches 'the spiritual equality of man and wife as heirs together', just as Paul also teaches married couples to 'mutual submission' where 'the wife's submissiveness is to be matched by the husband's self-giving love' (), thus complementing each other. Attitude to the fellowship (3:8‚Äì12) Peter concludes the sections of special relationships with the exhortation of the attitudes Christian should display to one another. Verse 9 :Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing. ESV *\\"Bless\\" (, ', a verb in present participle form;Greek Text Analysis: 1 Peter 3:9. Biblehub KJV: \\"blessing\\"): means 'the calling down of God's gracious power and love on all people', including those doing evil to us. *\\"May obtain\\" (ESV; Greek: , '; an active verb): or \\"should inherit\\" (KJV) *\\"A blessing\\" (Greek: , '; a noun): a promise given in . Suffering for doing good (3:13‚Äì17) To follow Christ's example of unjust suffering does not mean 'passivity', but an 'active doing of good' (='doing right'). Verse 14 :But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed. \\"And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled.\\" NKJV Cited from Isaiah 8:12b Verse 15 :But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear; NKJV * \\"Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts\\": Referring to Isaiah 8:13; not by making God holy (which is unnecessary), but by proclaiming and declaring His holiness (cf. the seraphim in the Book of Isaiah, or the four living creatures in the Book of Revelation). The Arabic version reads, \\"bless the Lord God in your hearts.\\" The Alexandrian, and one of Stephens's manuscripts, read, \\"sanctify the Lord Christ\\", as also in the Latin Vulgate and Syriac versions; for Christ is apparently the one intended in Isaiah 8:13 as concluded from compared with Romans 9:33; 1 Peter 2:8 *\\"Defense\\" (Greek: apologia): Christians should always be ready to give a defense, in word as well as action, for Christian faith (summarized here as \\"hope\\", cf. ,,). * \\"A reason for the hope that is in you\\": Theologian John Gill regards the \\"hope that is in the saints\\" (the Syriac version here calls the \\"hope of faith\\") as \\"the Gospel\\" or the whole Christian doctrine, that is, the doctrine of faith, and the profession of Christianity (cf. \\"the profession of hope\\" in ), in which Christians profess their hope of eternal life and happiness through Christ. As a \\"reason\\" for this \\"hope\\" is to be given, believers should know well the ground and foundation of the Christian religion. *\\"With meekness and fear\\": The giving of a defense is to be done with \\"meekness\\", in an humble modest way; not to provoke or irritate, and with \\"fear\\" of God (the Ethiopian version reads, \\"with the fear of the Lord\\") considering the subject and importance of the argument, and how much the honor of God is concerned in it, that no part of truth be dropped or concealed in order to please men, as was displayed before the Sanhedrin by Stephen, or before Antonius Felix, Porcius Festus, and Agrippa, by the Paul the Apostle. This reason, or answer, is to be given to everyone, who asks in a modest manner and with respect appropriate to the subject; as the phrases, \\"with meekness and fear\\", can be for the person who asks the reason, as well as the one who gives the answer; so that 'which is holy is not to be given to dogs', to impudent persons, mockers and scoffers, nor are 'pearls to be cast before swine', to irreverent persons (see Matthew 7:6). The Alexandrian manuscripts and some others, including the Vulgate Latin version, read, \\"but with meekness and fear\\".John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible ‚Äì 1 Peter 3:15 This is in agreement to the advice of R. Eleazar:Pirke Abot, c. 2. sect. 14. apud Gill, 1 Peter 3:15 ::be diligent to learn the law, and know what thou shouldest answer to an Epicure. Christological grounding (3:18‚Äì22) Jesus really died in his humanity when being 'put to death in the flesh', so 'made alive in the spirit' does not mean that a \\"part\\" of Christ survived death, but that 'God raised Christ to a new life in the divine realm' (cf. ; ; ). Verse 18 :For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, ESV David Wheaton regards this verse as one of the 'most succinct and yet profound statements in the New Testament on the doctrine of the atonement', in which Jesus has repaired the broken relationship between God and the humanity in three ways: # by being the perfect offering for sins (cf. ; ), fulfilling the requirements of the law. # by enduring the death penalty imposed on sinners due to unrighteousness according to the law (cf. Romans 6:23; ) # by removing the barrier caused by sins and opening for humans a way back to God (John 14:6). Jesus is the one person whose perfect righteousness means that he never deserves to die, but he endured the punishments (the pains of death) and took the place for (lit. \\"on behalf of\\") all the unrighteous (KJV: \\"unjust\\") people, who did deserve to die, so thereby satisfying all God's own demands for reconciliation (an act of propitiatory and also vicarious; cf. ). Verse 19 :By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; KJV *\\"The spirits in prison\\" refers to the days of Noah, whose 'experience of salvation' is very similar to \\"baptism\\".

Discovery  The tick was discovered in 1975 by James E. Kierans and Carleton M. Clifford in a cave located in Campeche, Mexico. The tick is very similar to those of the genus Antricola, but Nothoaspis reddelli is the only tick species with a false shield on the anterior (front) half of its body, showing it to be both a new genus and a new species.  Life cycle  The most common host of Nothoaspis reddelli is the insectivorous bat Mormoops megalophylla. A member of the Argasidae family, N. reddelli, has a multi-host life cycle (feeding on two or more hosts), feeding off each host to reach adulthood. After hatching, the instar finds its first host to feed upon and grows into a larva. The larva molts and develops into a nymph, which finds the second host. After feeding off and leaving its second host, N. reddelli molts once more. The nymph then feeds on a third host. This cycle is repeated for up to seven days, after which the nymph leaves its final host and molts to reach a sexually mature form. Mating and hatching of eggs occurs away from hosts. Mated females oviposit frequently, leaving multiple eggs (though fewer than 500 eggs per cycle).  Morphology  Females and males differ greatly in their hypostomal dentition. Males have two pairs of setae on the pedipalps, and females have one pair. The female hood is large, spherical, and can be seen from above. Females also have an oval-shaped plate with spiracles (holes that are used to breathe), located on the underside of the abdomen near the lungs. They have a hard, smooth outer coating on the front half of their dorsal surface composed of three large pieces positioned in a triangle: one in the front and two in the back. Each of these parts has two smaller parts on each side. The back of the dorsal surface is arranged in structures similar to cells. Adult and nymphal N. reddelli have a \\"false shield\\" over the anterior half of the body. Feeding N. reddelli, like all other ticks, must consume the host's blood as food. It cannot jump or fly, so it latches onto the ghost- faced bat and makes a hole in the bat's epidermis to drink blood. N. reddelli releases a numbing agent to keep the bat from becoming aware of the ticks presence, and releases an anticoagulant to keep the blood from clotting. When the tick is finished feeding, it unlatches from the bat and disembarks, where it will prepare for its next feeding.  Range and habitat  At first, it was believed that N. reddelli was endemic to Mexico. It was originally discovered in the guano of the ghost-faced bat in the Grutas de Xtacumbilxunam caves in Campeche, and was later observed in Yucat√°n and Tabasco. However, in 2015, N. reddelli was also found Nicaragua. The ghost-faced bat, and thus Nothoaspis reddelli, live in hot and humid caves. The environment within the cave is more important to the tick than the distribution of the ghost-faced bat, which is not much of a limiting factor. The cave in which the tick was first discovered is grimy, small, moist, and dark; it also contained a cenote. The Mayans once lived in the cave, but it is no longer inhabited by humans. N. reddelli thrives in temperatures ranging from .  Diseases  It is currently unknown whether Nothoaspis reddelli feeds off humans or carries diseases that humans are susceptible to.

Its headquarter is in Nairobi and it is run by the Department of Information, Ministry of Information Communication and Technology. News reports are created by KNA reporters in 72 county and sub-county offices and disseminated from the National Editorial Desk (Press Office) in Nairobi to subscribers made up of news media companies in Kenya and around the world. Their services also include Electronic/TV News Unit, Mobile Cinema and Photographic Services.Kenya News Agency: Products and Services  Pre- Independence  The work of the Kenya News Agency as a national news gathering operation began decades earlier with the Kenya Information Service (KIS) formed in 1939 to disseminate information on World War II. In 1945, after the war, the service changed its name to the African Information Service (AIS) and it served as an information unit mainly for the white settlers of the colonial British government. Between 1953 and 1954 the African Information Services became the Department of Information with the appointment of the first Director of Information and the first press officers. The new Department consisted of several sections ‚Äì Administrative, African, Press, Films and Photographs, Provincial Organizations and Information and Reference. It was administered from the Office of the Chief Secretary, at the time Richard Turnbull. The Department of Information served mainly as a propaganda machine especially during the state of emergency between 1954 - 1960.  After Independence  In 1962 in the lead up to independence, the Department was moved to the Ministry of State for Constitutional Affairs and Administration under then Hon. Mr. Ronald G. Ngala. On December 5, 1963, the Kenya News Agency was created. On December 12, 1963 Kenya attained self-rule and the Office of the Prime Minister was established with Hon. Mzee Jomo Kenyatta as the first Prime Minister of Kenya. Kenyatta convened his cabinet with the Hon. R. Achieng Oneko as the first Minister for Information, Broadcasting and Tourism. The Ministry‚Äôs functions then included Information Service (including Publications & Photographic Services) and the then newly created Kenya News Agency and Press Office. As a state-owned agency the Kenya News Agency was expected to project a positive image of Kenya and promote the work of the Government. With a national network, the Agency was initially the primary source of news report from outside the capital Nairobi, but as the road networks expanded and internet infrastructure improved, access to the rural areas became easier and more affordable for private sector news organisation to send their own reporters to cover news outside Nairobi. In 2016 Kenya News Agency made its historic image collection (more than 50,000 images) available online through a public portal Urithi. Urithi also includes audio and video content sourced from the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation.

It was one of the first architectural firms in the United States founded by married partners. Background on partners Victorine du Pont was born November 27, 1900, in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, to Antoine Biderman (or Bidermann) du Pont, Jr., and Mary Ethel (Clark) du Pont. The Du Ponts were an old and well-to-do family; her great- grandfather was the industrialist Alfred V. du Pont. She attended Wellesley College, where she earned her undergraduate degree in 1923. She went on to get her certificate in architecture in 1925 from the Cambridge School of Domestic and Landscape Architecture for Women (which was not yet a degree-granting institution); ten years later, after the school became affiliated with Smith College, she was awarded the M. Arch degree. After leaving the Cambridge School, she worked as a draftsperson at the firm of Allen and Collens in Boston (1926‚Äì27), and there she met Samuel Homsey, whom she married in 1929. In 1928‚Äì29, she moved to another Boston firm, P. Patterson Smith, where she also worked as a draftsperson. Samuel Eldon Homsey was born August 29, 1904, in Boston, Massachusetts, to Elias S. and Margaret (Sabbag) Homsey. He earned both his B.S. and his M.S. Arch degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, graduating with his master's degree in 1926. He later studied painting informally and painted landscapes in watercolor, several of which are in the collection of the Biggs Museum of American Art. Architectural practice Victorine and Samuel moved to Wilmington, Delaware, and in 1935 opened a firm known as Victorine & Samuel Homsey (later Victorine & Samuel Homsey, Inc.). They are thought to have been the first Delaware architects to work in the International Style, and one of their early house designs was chosen by New York's Museum of Modern Art to represent International Style in a 1938 Paris exhibition. In general, however, their style was more eclectic, and in part because they began their careers during the Great Depression, they felt it was important for architects to work on developing ways to work economically and with new materials. In 1950, one of their house designs for small sites was included in a \\"Five-Star\\" series developed by Better Homes and Gardens magazines, the working drawings and specifications for which could be bought by mail for $5. The firm of Victorine & Samuel Homsey is considered one of Wilmington's most influential architectural practices of the mid 20th century, designing residences, schools, churches, and other buildings. Some of the team's commissions came from Du Pont-sponsored institutions such as Longwood Gardens and the Winterthur Museum, for which they designed the visitor's pavilion, lecture hall, and an office block. Other notable commissions include the Delaware Art Museum (1955) and a later expansion thereto; the American Embassy in Tehran, Iran (1964); the Cambridge Yacht Club in Maryland, which won a design award from the Maryland Association of Architects; and the Dover Public Library. A 1938 Colonial Revival‚Äìstyle house that they built has since been placed on the National Register of Historic Places and today serves as the administrative building for Mt. Cuba Center, a historical preserve and botanical garden not far from Wilmington. Victorine was also in demand as a landscape architect and designed a number of Delaware gardens. She was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1967. She held a number of appointments in her field, including serving on the Washington Fine Arts Commission and the advisory board of the Historic American Buildings Survey; and she chaired the Restoration Committee for the Octagon House, the AIA's headquarters in Washington, D.C. During World War II, they moved to Washington, D.C., where Samuel served in the Naval Reserve for four years as a commander in the office of research and inventions. During the war, Victorine partnered with architect Eugene H. Klaber to design an elementary school and a large federal public housing development in Greenbelt, Maryland. Samuel was a Fellow of the AIA and also held the post of vice-president for two years (1965‚Äì67). He served on a number of different Delaware zoning commissions and planning boards. Both Homseys retired in 1979; they turned the firm over to the younger of their two sons, the architect Eldon du Pont Homsey, and it became known as Homsey Architects, Inc. Samuel died in 1994 on May 22, 1994, and Victorine died four years later on January 6, 1998. Records of their practice from 1937 on are held by the Hagley Museum and Library in Wilmington.

The beeswax wreck is an as-yet- undiscovered shipwreck somewhere off the coast of the U.S. state of Oregon, near Neahkahnie Mountain and the mouth of the Nehalem River in Tillamook County. The ship, thought to be a Spanish Manila galleon that was wrecked in the late-1600s, was carrying a large cargo of beeswax, lumps of which have been found scattered along Oregon's north coast for at least two centuries. Early history The earliest written reference to the wreck dates from 1813, when fur trader Alexander Henry, of Astoria, noted that the local Clatsop tribe had \\"great quantities of beeswax\\" to trade, which they told him had come from a shipwreck near Nehalem Bay. Chunks of beeswax continued to be discovered along the shoreline throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, leading to much speculation about its origin. In the early 1900s, some scientists suggested, erroneously, that the substance was in fact a mineral residue left behind by petroleum which had been forced up to the surface from some underground reservoir ‚Äì at least one drilling project was undertaken in the area on the basis of this theory. Identity Although efforts to locate the wreck have so far met with no success, researchers have found clues to its identity in the debris that has washed ashore. In addition to the beeswax, teak timbers and shards of Chinese porcelain have been found, suggesting that the wreck is that of a Spanish Manila galleon, which would have made regular trips from Manila, Philippines, to Acapulco, Mexico, in the days of the Spanish Empire. Such ships were often constructed from teak, and would have been carrying luxury Chinese goods such as porcelain to trade ‚Äì along with beeswax, which would have been needed by churches in the Spanish colonies for making candles. The theory is strengthened by the fact that much of the beeswax is marked with Spanish shipping symbols, and the wings of bees native to the Philippines have been found trapped inside the wax. It is not known, however, why a Manila galleon would be sailing off the coast of Oregon, far north of the usual trade route; it is possible that it was disabled in a storm and drifted off course. By studying the designs on the porcelain shards, a team of researchers led by Scott Williams concluded in 2011 that the wreck must date from the late 17th century. According to the comprehensive records kept by the Spanish government of the time, only two Manila galleons went missing during that period ‚Äì the Santo Christo de Burgos, in 1693, and the San Francisco Xavier, in 1705. The San Francisco Xavier was initially considered the more likely candidate, partly because it was thought that a tsunami which struck the Oregon coast in 1700 would have destroyed any evidence of an earlier shipwreck; however, after conducting further surveys, Williams' team now believes that the tsunami played a key role in dispersing the debris along the coastline, and that the wreck's true identity is therefore the Santo Christo de Burgos. They also believe that the wreck is probably located further north than previously thought, close to Neahkahnie Mountain. In July 2018 a special issue of the Oregon Historical Quarterly was devoted to the wreck. Titled ‚ÄúOregon's Manila Galleon\\", the issue features articles describing the ongoing research as of 2018. According to the issue's articles the galleon was probably the Santo Cristo de Burgos, voyage of 1693. Oral histories of the Tillamook and Clatsop are described, as well as the archaeology efforts and results as of 2018. Additional articles provide information about the crew, passengers, and cargo that was aboard the Santo Cristo. See also *Cronin Point Site *Augustus C.

The Nelson Street Cycleway is a cycleway (and in some sections, a shared pathway for walking and cycling) in Auckland, New Zealand. The most well-known section of the path is , translated as, and commonly known as Lightpath (also known as the Pink Path), which is located on the old Nelson Street motorway off-ramp. The cycleway then continues on to the Nelson Street arterial road into the City Centre. Stage 1 of the project was opened on 3 December 2015, and Stage 2 opened in December 2017. The last part of the route to the waterfront remains incomplete as of 2019. Once completed, the route will give access from Upper Queen Street to the Auckland CBD and the cycleway along the waterfront. Stage 1 utilises an unused off-ramp in the Central Motorway Junction (CMJ) where State Highway 1 and 16 cross - this is the section that is called Lightpath - plus the first three street blocks of Nelson Street up to Victoria Street West. Unique features of the old offramp are the hot-pink colour of its surface, and its LED mood lighting system that constantly changes; the latter feature inspired the MƒÅori name. Route The chosen route starts at Upper Queen Street, linking there with the Northwestern Cycleway that has been extended to descend into Grafton Gully via the Symonds Street Cemetery. Turning off Upper Queen Street into Canada Street, a new bridge connects to the old Nelson Street off- ramp. The motorway infrastructure links into the urban road network at traffic lights at Union Street. From here, a protected cycleway runs along the left side of Nelson Street for three blocks, crossing Cook Street and Wellesley Street West at traffic lights. The route currently finishes at Victoria Street West, where the facility crosses the signalised intersection diagonally to the north-east quadrant. History Nelson Street old off-ramp (highlighted) in 2007. Night works lifting in the prefabricated final (and biggest) Canada Street span over State Highway 1. In 2005, the motorway off-ramp that made a connection from the CMJ to Auckland's Nelson Street was closed and replaced with an upgraded ramp. The old Nelson Street off-ramp was difficult to reach for drivers coming from the Northwestern Motorway, as they had to weave to the right within the CMJ. The new Nelson Street off-ramp was opened on 3 July 2005 and allowed for the principle of keeping left when leaving the motorway. The concept of using the old off-ramp as a cycleway appears to first arise in the Central Motorway Junction Walking and Cycling Masterplan 2012 by the NZTA. Max Robitzsch, a transport engineer and member of Bike Auckland, is credited with helping turn this idea into reality, inspired by New York's High Line. In May 2014, he organised a walking tour on the off-ramp for members of Cycle Action Auckland and the Auckland Transport Blog, and followed up with a blog post in which he proposed to link the off-ramp to the road network south of the city centre via a ramp build from scaffolding with Karangahape Road. In a follow-up meeting with Transport Agency staff, the idea found their support. When the National government announced a NZ$100 million package for cycling infrastructure in August 2014 during the campaign for the , the Nelson Street Cycleway was added to the list of projects in January 2015 by the Minister of Transport, Simon Bridges. The partners in this project were the NZ Transport Agency, Auckland Transport, and Auckland Council. GHD and Novare Design were the designers of the Lighpath with Monk Mackenzie Architects responsible for the urban and architectural design components. Canada Street bridge A bridge weighing connects Canada Street to the former off-ramp. The bridge, designed by Novare Design was built in a workshop in Hamilton in eight sections and transported to Pukekohe for corrosion protection and painting. The southbound motorway lanes were closed overnight on seven occasions between 20 August and 10 September 2015 for preparations and to lift the bridge sections into place. Opening of stage 1 In a video released by the NZ Transport Agency before the opening of stage 1 of the project, the Nelson Street Cycleway was called \\"New Zealand's most ambitious piece of cycling infrastructure\\". The project was opened 3 December 2015by Ernst Z√∂llner (Regional Director Auckland/Northland for the Transport Agency), transport minister Bridges, Chris Darby (elected member of Auckland Council), and Barbara Cuthbert (chair of Bike Auckland, recently renamed from Cycle Action Auckland). Stage 2 Stage 2 opened in December 2017 and extends along Nelson Street from Victoria Street West to Fanshaw Street, and then a short section down Market Place until Pakenham Street East intersection. Stage 3 There is a proposal to install a bi-directional cycleway on Market Place, Customs Street West and then the western side of Lower Hobson Street; completing the city centre loop. Consultations were held in late 2017.  Usage  After less than a year, path usage (cycle counts only, without pedestrians) was at approximately 750 per day.

In 1989, he graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar with highest honors. Career Ubi√±as spent 18 years at McKinsey & Company as a consultant in the areas of telecommunications, technology and media. He helped found the Media Practice at McKinsey, where as a Senior Partner he led the Practice on the West Coast; his work centered on the introduction and development of the underlying technologies and applications of internet technologies, both wired and wireless. Ubi√±as was also president of the Ford Foundation for six years. He is now an investor and entrepreneur. Ford Foundation Ubi√±as served as president of the Ford Foundation from January 2008 through 2013. During his tenure as president, Ubi√±as significantly restructured the organization. The restructuring effort focused the foundation's number of program areas from over 200 to 35, and defined eight major issues, including access to education, economic opportunity and human rights, as its core objectives. Ubi√±as increased the Ford Foundation's focus on social justice issues. He also reinvested over 80% of the Foundation's endowment, moving its endowment performance from bottom quartile to top quartile performance among endowments over $3 billion, renovated the network of international offices and modernized the Foundation's systems. During his tenure operating costs fell 33%, while grantee satisfaction rose. Restructuring during the 2008/9 financial crisis was not without controversy, since, a few months after announcing $22 million in budget cutbacks in spring 2009, Ford announced the closure of field offices in Vietnam and Russia and offered voluntary severance packages to some New York staff to trim an additional $14 million from the budget, despite its earlier mention that no staff cuts would occur. Some employees claimed that only 3% in management were given the severance offer, that Ubi√±as \\"had rejected a proposal that management take a pay cut instead,\\" and that many who were offered the severance were women, single parents and/or from minority groups. A Ford spokesperson noted that, \\"'29 percent of the staff members receiving the severance offer were African-American. Seven percent of the offers went to managers...,adding that the discrepancy between that number and the figure offered by the critics could have come from different definitions of who is a manager.'\\" Pan American Development Foundation From 2015 to 2019, Ubi√±as served as the president of the Board of Trustees of the Pan American Development Foundation, an organization that works with governments, non-profit organizations and corporations to fund and administer development projects in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Other activities Ubi√±as is Chairman of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation and the New York Public Library, where he is a member of the Executive Committee and Chair of the Finance Committee. He serves as an Advisory Committee Member for the United Nations Fund for International Partnerships which overseas the United Nations' relationships with non- governmental partners, where he is in his fourth term, appointed by two Secretaries General. He has also served on the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiation, the Advisory Committee for the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and as Northwest Regional Chair for White House Fellows. He has held top-secret national security clearance. In the private sector, Ubi√±as is a board member of Aura Financial, which provides ethical credit to unbanked communities; GFR Media, the largest media company in Puerto Rico; and EBSCO industries, the leading provider of full text academic content to libraries, universities and private sector entities.

A capitalistic economy must expand to survive and find new markets to support this expansion. Capitalist systems are often thought to be destructive to the environment as well as certain individuals without access to proper representation. However, sustainability provides quite the opposite; it implies not only a continuation, but a replenishing of resources. Sustainability is often thought of to be related to environmentalism, and sustainable capitalism applies sustainable principles to economic governance and social aspects of capitalism as well. The importance of sustainable capitalism has been more recently recognized, but the concept is not new. Changes to the current economic model would have heavy social environmental and economic implications and require the efforts of individuals, as well as compliance of local, state and federal governments. Controversy surrounds the concept as it requires an increase in sustainable practices and a marked decrease in current consumptive behaviors. This is a concept of capitalism described in Al Gore and David Blood‚Äôs manifesto for the Generation Investment Management to describe a long-term political, economic and social structure which would mitigate current threats to the planet and society.https://www.genfound.org/media/pdf-wsj-manifesto-sustainable- capitalism-14-12-11.pdf According to their manifesto, sustainable capitalism would integrate the environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects into risk assessment in attempt to limit externalities. Most of the ideas they list are related to economic changes, and social aspects, but strikingly few are explicitly related to any environmental policy change.  Governance and economic aspects  Economic aspects are clearest, perhaps because the economy is most easily associated with capitalism. Sustainable capitalism, as a policy outline, is an attempt to address and tackle the use of admittedly insufficient tools used today to measure the economic growth and the real value of countries, such as GDP or GO. Criticism of this form of growth measurement is centered on the fact that GDP fails to account for labor conditions and other environmental factors which have a long-term influence on the value which it measures.http://www.investopedia.com/exam-guide/cfa- level-1/macroeconomics/limitations-gdp-alternative.asp?header_alt=c This concept follows recent trends that see forms of sustainable business as the preferred method for development, because of the way that these types of businesses offer a positive influence to their environment. Many of these stem from business-led corporate responsibility coalitions which aim to mitigate ESG impacts through mobilization of resources. These business are not limited to the traditional non-profits we associate with corporate responsibility, but also can be independent, non-profit, for-profit, led by a board of directors or core-funded. The wide spectrum of business types shows the gradual turn towards socially and environmentally responsible corporate governance. Sustainable capitalism challenges the common model of the capitalist economy by its linear frame. Raw materials, either natural resources or intellect, when combined with a capital increasing mechanism, like worker power, create marketable products that are sold for money and waste. In the concept of sustainable capitalism, it appears to be necessary to shift to a more circular economy where the end product would be reinvested not only to the capitalist business or financial institution but into the basis for raw materials, and people who support this business. This type of circular economy would require more responsibility on corporate governance to reduce externalities. China has made advances in this area, increasing renewable energy industries, with an estimate that fossil fuels will no longer be the main source of energy by 2030; these steps toward change were forced in part by high pollution and population. In their manifesto, Gore and Blood propose key economic measures to change from the current form of capitalism:. # Identify and incorporate risks from stranded assets. # Mandate integrated reporting. # End the default practice of issuing quarterly earnings guidance. # Align compensation structures with long-term sustainable performance. # Encourage long-term investing with loyalty-driven securities. # Reinforce sustainability as a fiduciary issue. # Create advisory services for sustainable asset management. # Expand the range and depth of sustainable investment products. # Reconsider the appropriate definition for growth beyond GDP. # Integrate sustainability into business education at all levels. The first five items are most related to economic changes, while the last five are actions more related to social aspects. Of these ten, only two are directly related to environmental aspects, and none explicitly suggest environmental policy changes.  Environmental aspects  As explained by Bruce Ledewitz, sustainable capitalism is the adoption and development of sustainable practices that protect natural resources, instead of spending it as capital. Ledewitz claims that in traditional capitalism, ‚Äúnatural capital,‚Äù meaning natural resources, will continue to decline and will limit monetary capital success, lifting the value of natural resources and replacing the definition of prosperity. He proposes that sustainable capitalism would institute policies and regulations to protect natural resources in addition to investing back into the environment in attempt to reverse the degradation.  Social aspects  Social aspects of sustainable capitalism involve a positive reception toward climate change. Author Mohan Munasinghe explains that two specific ways that humans can respond to climate change are through adaptation and mitigation. First, adaptation is aimed at reducing the vulnerability of human and natural systems in the face of climate change stresses, while mitigation is aimed at lowering or removing GHG emissions to reduce radiative forcing of the atmosphere and the intensity of future climate change. Economist John Ikerd claims that environmental degradation happens under modern capitalism because the economy is divorced from ethics. According to him, classical economists like Adam Smith had always intended for market economics to be tempered by property owners' moralities, and neoclassical economists put undue faith in the ability of markets to automatically adjust to physical and moral imperatives. Ikerd concludes that a system of environmental regulations founded on a popular, ethical consensus is necessary and sufficient to prevent excessive climate change. Sustainable capitalism is also viewed as a non-transcendent, regulated commodity to humanity due to the ever-increasing demands of environmental regulation. Geoffrey Strickland emphasizes that current discussions on economic development are led by the notion that human reproduction is a commodity that must be regulated and improved in order to encourage market efficiency, which is a phenomenon that counteracts the growth of capitalism.  Criticism   Marxist view  According to the Marxist understanding of capitalism as production for profit, it is impossible to prioritize environmental sustainability without abolishing capitalism. Ernest Mandel claims that when profit maximization requires a business to pollute the air, \\"the simple right to clean air is abolished\\". Under his conception of capitalism, profit necessarily subjugates the environment, and properly accounting for the social costs of production requires some form of socialist planning. Any attempt to adequately protect the environment within such a capitalist framework is doomed to fail, so the argument goes, because society simply is not structured to be willing to sacrifice private profits for public endeavors on this scale.  Sustainable capitalism as an oxymoron  The Capital Institute describes the concept of sustainable capitalism as an oxymoron. They argue that modern capitalism is not designed for cooperation and much of the proposed measures in the manifesto are insufficient. Regeneration, cooperation, and well-being are aspects of sustainability that do not coincide with what capitalism has evolved to be. Efforts may be made to reform current capitalistic practices, but mass movements focusing on environmental concerns that do not create a radical change of the system are not likely to succeed as they go against what capitalism was designed to achieve. Capitalism and sustainability are mutually exclusive ideas given the current model.  Government reluctance  Critics such as Neil E. Harrison argue that the government would likely be resistant to sustainable changes for the current capitalist model. Since the capitalist government was built upon capitalist ideals and business interests, he argues, the government is dependent on the system. Often, the government is most focused on overt crises rather than long-term solutions to problems that are not readily apparent. His main argument is that beyond the current structure, authority is not enough to control the social and economic aspects enough to truly impact the environmental needs.

The Pampean orogeny took place near the right border of the area marked as \\"R√≠o Plata\\". Terranes and microcontinents such as Cuyania, Pampia and Chilenia are omitted. The Pampean orogeny () was an orogeny active in the Cambrian in the western margin of the ancient landmass of Gondwana. The orogens remains can now be observed in central Argentina, in particular at the Sierras de C√≥rdoba and other parts of the eastern Sierras Pampeanas. It is uncertain if the orogeny involved at some point a continental collision. The Pampean orogen can be considered both part of the larger Terra Australis orogen and of the Brasiliano orogeny. The Pampean orogeny was succeeded by the Famatinian orogeny further west. Magmatic belts The Pampean orogen contains a magmatic belt including granodiorites, monzogranites, and volcanic rocks, all of them of calc-alkaline chemistry. The igneous rocks of this belt formed at various times in over the period from 555 to 525 million years ago. From 525 million years ago onward another magmatic belt of peralumineous and mafic rocks developed further amidst gneiss, schist, amphibolites and carbonate rocks. The igneous rocks of this belt formed in the period from 525 to 515 million years ago. Tectonic interpretation The Pampean orogeny can be considered part of the larger Terra Australis orogeny or of the Brasiliano orogeny. The Pampean orogeny developed at a similar time as the Paraguai Belt of the Brasiliano Orogeny, but in difference to the Paraguay Belt that ended up in the interior of Gondwana the Pampean Orogen remained at a continental margin. The orogen eventually ceased activity and was succeeded by the Famatinian orogeny further west. The eastern magmatic belt of the Pampean orogeny is interpreted as the remains of a volcanic arc associated with an east-dipping subduction zone while the western one is thought to represent a younger volcanic arc that developed on what was once the accretionary prism of the orogen. There have been differing views among geologists on the tectonic and paleogeographic position of the Puncoviscana Basin in relation to the events of the Pampean orogeny. The Pampean orogeny is believed by some geologists to be associated with the accretion of a \\"Pampia Terrane\\" to the R√≠o de la Plata Craton, resulting from the closure of a sea that existed in-between. This sea would have been the Puncoviscana Basin. V√≠ctor Ramos proposes instead that the Puncoviscana Basin was a foreland basin located west of a \\"Pampia block\\" that collided with R√≠o de la Plata Craton. Contrasting to this view Ace√±olaza and Toselli claim instead that the Puncoviscana Basin originated from an aulacogen splitting Arequipa-Antofalla Craton from R√≠o de la Plata and Guapor√© Craton. Following this interpretation the aulacogen would have closed during the Pampean orogeny.

She was the second woman to be admitted to a Greek university and was a trained physiotherapist prior to taking up her religious calling at the age of 60. Biography Avrilia Papayannis was born on 15 October (2 October O.S.) 1897 N.S. in Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire as the youngest child of Helias and Victoria Papayannis, a wealthy Greek family. She grew up in Constantinople and lived there until her family was deported during the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey and sent to Thessaloniki. She entered the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, becoming the second woman ever admitted to a Greek university, where she earned a degree in philosophy. She had previously graduated with a degree in botany at a Swiss university. In 1932, she moved to Athens and cared for nursing home residents until 1938 when she moved to England to study podiatry and physiotherapy, where she remained until the end of World War II. Career In 1945, Papayannis returned to Greece and began working with the American Farm School and Friends Relief Service in Thessaloniki, until 1947, when she moved to Athens and opened a physiotherapy practice. For a decade she operated her office using funds from her paying clients to provide assistance to the poor. Upon the death of her mother, in 1954, she took a vow of poverty and gave all her worldly possessions away. The following year, she moved to India to work with the poor and assist Baba Amte in his work with leper communities in India. After four years of providing free physiotherapy to the poor, Papayannis went to the Himalayan Mountains, spending eleven months in solitude as a hermit. She then traveled to Landour where she met an American woman, who arranged for her to go to the monastery headed by Father Theodosius in Bethany, in the Holy Land in 1960. She arrived at the Bethany Community of the Resurrection of the Lord and after accepting tonsure became a nun. After her three-year novitiate, Papayannis took the name Gavrielia. Sister Gavrielia was sent to the Taiz√© Community in France by the Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople, though her assignment there was brief. She was then sent to the United States, where she toured ethnic Greek communities in seventeen states and accompanied many mentally ill patients to psychiatric hospitals in Europe. After nearly a decade of touring, speaking, and helping the sick, she was sent to East Africa for three years to do missionary work. Following a brief assignment in Germany, Sister Gavrielia was sent back to India, where she remained for three years. In 1979, she was given use of an Athens apartment and became a \\"Gerontissa\\" (elder), counseling disciples and helping the sick over the next ten years. Near the end of her life, she retreated to a hermitage in Aegina, but when she developed Hodgkin's disease she returned to Athens. After a miraculous healing, she left Athens two years before her death and moved to the island of Leros. Gerontissa Gavrielia died on Leros on 28 March, 1992.  Legacy  In 1996 a biography of her life entitled I Askitiki tis Agapis was published in Greek, in 1999 the book was translated into English, and in 2000 into Russian. It has since had 14 Greek editions, 2 English editions, and has been translated into Arabic, French and Serbian.

They are nonflammable and more easily recycled than batteries that employ toxic or flammable materials.  History  In 2008 Carnegie Mellon professor Jay Whitacre founded Aquion Energy and received venture funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers. He won the 2015 Lemelson‚ÄìMIT Prize, an award worth $500,000, for inventing the company's salt water battery. They are the first and only battery manufacturer to have met all the stringent criteria to obtain Cradle-to-Cradle (Bronze) certification. The company raised $190 million in equity and debt before going bankrupt in 2017, then being acquired by a Chinese company later that year for slightly under $10 million. Design  Aquion Energy  Aquion Energy's batteries are classified as standard goods with no special handling required in shipment. It has no life-reducing side reactions while not in use. It is robust to any variable cycling profiles and long duration intervals while partially charged. Maintenance cycling to maintain performance/life is unnecessary. Its optimal operating temperature range is -5 ¬∞C to 40 ¬∞C and are little affected by operational temperature swings. It operates without auxiliary loads or an external power supply. Its chemistry is not susceptible to thermal runaway. Active thermal management is generally not required, except given extreme ambient temperature. Its mechanical materials can be recycled in normal recycling streams. Chemical materials can be disposed of without special equipment or containers.  Water in salt  A different design used an electrolyte that has a salt to water ratio of six to one, nearly saturated, such that it could also be called a water in salt battery.  Solid- electrolyte interphase  In November 2015, researchers from the University of Maryland and the Army Research Laboratory claimed that they had induced the cell to form a Solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), a first for an aqueous electrolyte. The SEI allows the aqueous lithium-ion battery to operate at higher voltages and self-discharge more slowly. The high salt concentration allows the interphase to form. It raised the maximum voltage for such a battery from 1.23 V to around 3 V. At 2.4V, the battery's specific energy was approximately 100 watt-hour/kg and it displayed consistent performance over 1,000 charge/discharge cycles. The device operated with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency at both low (0.15 C) and high (4.5 C) discharge and charge rates. In September 2017, researchers stated they were able to raise the voltage to 4.0 volts. In May 2019, researchers published an article where the voltage increased to 4.2 volts. High specific capacity from a densely packed stage-I graphite intercalation compound of C3.5[Br0.5Cl0.5] can form reversibly in water-in-bisalt electrolyte. By coupling this cathode with a passivated graphite anode, a cell can achieve an energy density of 460 watt-hours per kilogram of total composite electrode and about 100 per cent coulombic efficiency.

His writings appeared in the press, both in Israel and abroad. While living in Hungary, he wrote mostly poetry and drama but after moving to Israel, he discovered a new writing genre and started creating prose: short stories and short novels. His critics attest to his short stories, diverse style, a realistic vision combined with poetic symbolism, dealing with lyrical and philosophical themes. A recurring motif in many of his stories is the eternal longing of man for joy and beauty, while helplessly swept in the torrent of blind fate, in the terrifying shadow of war. At the same time, his satirical writings, interspersed with fine humor, bear testimony to Lad√°nyi‚Äôs zest for life and to his faith in the victory of humanism and common sense.Article about Lad√°nyi's works, his literary style, themes and his book \\"T≈±z√∂z√∂n\\" (Fireflood) ‚Äì Tam√°s Acz√©l, \\"Irodalmi √öjs√°g\\" (Paris) September 15, 1968. page 5.Literary Criticism about Lad√°nyi's book ‚Äì \\"A l√°ngol√≥ √∂zvegy\\" (Hot Widow). \\"Newyorki figyel≈ë\\" (New York), July 24, 1980.Article about Lad√°nyi's poems, his literary style and his book ‚Äì \\"≈êszi ver≈ëf√©ny\\" (Bright Autumn Sun).

Caricature of L√°szl√≥ Lad√°nyi His life and work in Hungary In 1925, Lad√°nyi graduated from the high school of the Budapest Academy of Commerce. His writing talent became evident in his early youth. He published his first poem in 1923 in the literary paper \\"√öj Sz√°zadok\\" (New Centuries), after which his poems were frequently printed in the Budapest periodicals. Between 1936 and 1949 he became a regularly published poet in the literary weeklyHungarian art and literature weekly, first published in 1894. Became the most widely distributed literary periodical in Hungary. It printed the works of some of the best Hungarian authors and poets. It closed down in 1949. \\"√öj Id≈ëk (1894-1949)\\" (New Times)List of poems published in \\"√öj Id≈ëk\\" and was included in several anthologies. Lad√°nyi‚Äôs first volume of poems, \\"Az √©jszaka csod√°ja\\" (Mystery of the Night) came out in 1940. In the same year, he was forced to join the Hungarian labour service, where he languished almost continuously until 1944. In February 1943 he received a one-day leave to marry Edit Utassy, with whom he lived until his death. He described these hard times in his autobiographical novel \\"My Life‚Äôs Carousel\\", as well as in numerous poems. While yearning for home and his wife - the love of his life - he was subjected to years of humiliation by his commanders, to hard labour, hunger and devastating cold. At the end of 1944, after the Nazis had occupied Hungary and his company was stationed in Romania, he managed to escape and hide in Romanian villages, thereby saving his life. Upon returning home in 1945 after the war, he found out that his parents and many of his relatives had been murdered. Only his sister and wife survived. In 1945 Lad√°nyi became a member of the newly established Hungarian Writers‚Äô Association. He published poetry, articles, plays and children‚Äôs stories. His three-act rhymed play was successfully produced in a Budapest theatre in 1953. The radio broadcast many of his works, including a three-act musical play, a rhymed satirical drama, several short plays, poems and dramatized stories.Hungarian Radio LexiconHungarian Radio Lexicon In May 1957, in the wake of the Hungarian Revolution, he emigrated to Israel with his wife and daughter and lived there until his death. The Israeli period During his first years in Israel, Lad√°nyi made a living as a photographer. His photos won prizes and participated in exhibitions in the building of the Israeli Journalists‚Äô Association. Between 1967 and 1977 he worked at the Ministry of Communications as a technical draftsman. At the same time, he continued writing in Hungarian. His short stories and serial novels were regularly published in the Israeli Hungarian press: the daily \\"√öj kelet\\" (New East), the weekly \\"A h√©t\\" (The week) and the literary quarterly \\"K√∫tf≈ë\\" (Source).Periodical review of literature, art and society He also translated short stories from Hebrew and English for the Hungarian press.

For spiritually pioneering the 1956 Hungarian revolution, it was closed down and its editors, together with many other writers, had to relocate to Western Europe and continue their activities in exile. In 1957 the periodical was resumed first in Vienna, later in London, supported by the American Congress for Cultural Freedom. It became the mouthpiece of the Hungarian writers in exile. In 1962 it moved to Paris. In 1989 it was published in Budapest again but closed down after two issues. As a foreign correspondent of the periodical, in 1961 he documented the Eichmann Trial in a series of articles. His short stories were also printed in the London \\"N√©pszava\\" (People's Voice),Hungarian paper published in London.

The term ‚Äúplant strategy‚Äù has existed in the literature since at least 1965, however multiple definitions exist. Strategies have been classified as adaptive strategies (through a change in the genotype), reproductive strategies, resource allocation strategies, ecological strategies, and functional trait based strategies, to name a few. While numerous strategies exist, one underlying theme is constant: plants must make trade-offs when responding to their environment. These trade- offs and responses lay the groundwork for classifying the strategies that emerge.  Background  The concept of plant strategies started gaining attention in the 1960s and 1970s. At this time, strategies were often associated with genotypic changes, such that plants could respond to their environment by changing their ‚Äúgenotypic programme‚Äù (i.e., strategy). Around this same time, the r/K selection theory was introduced, which classifies plants by life history strategies, particularly reproductive strategies. In general, plants alter their reproductive strategies (i.e., number of offspring) and their growth rate to respond to their ecological niche. The theory is still popular in the 21st century and frequently taught in science curricula. However, plant strategies really gained notoriety in 1977 with the introduction of Grime‚Äôs C-S-R Triangle, which categorizes plants according to how they respond under varying levels of stress and competition. According to Grime, plants develop strategies that demonstrate resource trade-offs between growth, reproduction, and maintenance. The association between genotypic change and strategies was also still present in Grime‚Äôs theories, as he noted that the ‚Äúgenotypes of the majority of plants appear to represent compromises between the conflicting selection pressures‚Äù that generally classify plants into three strategy types. The C-S-R Triangle remained the dominant plant strategy for several decades. However, in the early 1980s David Tilman introduced the R* theory, which focused on resource partitioning as strategies to deal with competition. More recently, additional strategies have been introduced. In 1998, the L-H-S strategy scheme was introduced as an alternative to Grime's C-S-R scheme. The L-H-S strategy focuses on leaf and seed mass traits to classify plant strategies, noting that these traits can be measured and compared between species, which cannot easily be done with Grime's abstract categories. The goal of the L-H-S scheme was to develop an international network that could provide quantifiable comparisons between plant strategies. This started a movement towards incorporating functional traits in plant strategies, and understanding how plant functional traits and environmental factors are related. While Grime's C-S-R Triangle is still frequently referenced in plant ecology, new strategies are being introduced and gaining momentum in the 21st century.  Grime's C-S-R Triangle / Universal Adaptive Strategy Theory (UAST)  J. P. Grime identified two factor gradients, broadly categorized as disturbance and stress, which limit plant biomass. Stresses include factors such as the availability of water, nutrients, and light, along with growth-inhibiting influences like temperature and toxins. Conversely, disturbance encompasses herbivory, pathogens, anthropogenic interactions, fire, wind, etc. Emerging from high and low combinations of stress and disturbance are three life strategies commonly used to categorize plants based on environment: (1) C-competitors, (2) S-stress tolerators, and (3) R-ruderals. There is no viable strategy for plants in high stress and high disturbance environments, therefore categorization for this habitat type is absent. Each life strategy varies in trade-offs of resource allocation to seed production, leaf morphology, leaf longevity, relative growth rate, and other factors, which can be summarized as allocation to (1) growth, (2) reproduction, and (3) maintenance. Competitors are primarily composed of species with high relative growth rate, short leaf-life, relatively low seed production, and high allocation to leaf construction. They persist in high nutrient, low disturbance environments, and ‚Äúrapidly monopolize resource capture by the spatially-dynamic foraging of roots and shoots.‚Äù Stress-tolerators, found in high stress, low disturbance habitats, allocate resources to maintenance and defenses, such as anti-herbivory. Species are often evergreen with small, long-lived leaves or needles, slow resource turnover, and low plasticity and relative growth rate. Due to high stress conditions, vegetative growth and reproduction are reduced. Ruderals, inhabiting low stress, high disturbance regimes, allocate resources mainly to seed reproduction and are often annuals or short-lived perennials. Common characteristics of ruderal species include high relative growth rate, short- lived leaves, and short statured plants with minimal lateral expansion.  Tilman‚Äôs R* Rule  G. David Tilman developed the R* rule in support of resource competition theory. Theoretically, a plant species growing in monoculture, and utilizing a single limiting resource, will deplete the resource until reaching an equilibrium level where growth and losses are balanced. The concentration of the resource at the equilibrium level is termed R*; this is the minimum concentration at which the plant is able to persist in the environment. Population growth is indicated by values greater than the R*. Conversely, population decline is associated with values lower than the R*. If two species are competing for the same limiting resource, the superior competitor will have the lowest R* value for that resource. This will eventually lead to the displacement of the inferior competitor, regardless of initial plant densities. Displacement rate depends on the magnitude of the difference in R*. Greater differences lead to a faster exclusion. Every plant species differs in R* values due to differences in plant morphology and physiology. The realized R* level is dependent on physical factors that vary by habitat, such as temperature, pH, and humidity.  Westoby‚Äôs L-H-S Strategy  In 1998, Mark Westoby proposed a plant ecology strategy scheme (PESS) to explain species distributions based on traits. The dynamic model incorporated a three axes trade-off among specific leaf area (SLA), canopy height at maturity, and seed mass. SLA is defined as the area per unit dry mass of mature leaves, developed in the fullest natural light of the species. These traits were selected for incorporation because of their trade-off functionality. Resource allocation to one trait is only possible by diverting resources from the others. Similarly to Grime's C-S-R triangle, each gradient represents different strategic responses to the environment; variation in disturbance adaptation is represented by canopy height and seed mass (Grime's R-axis), whereas SLA reflects variation in growth in response to stress (Grime's C-S axis). The L-H-S strategy avoids the assumption that high disturbance, high stress environments lack viable plant strategies, unlike Grime's model. However, Westoby's model is at a disadvantage when predicting potential variation in plant strategies since the axes only include single variables, compared to Grime's multivariable axes.  r/K Selection  This linear model, first introduced by MacArthur and Wilson (1967), has been commonly applied to both plants and animals to describe reproductive strategies. Representing opposing extremes of a continuum, r-species commit all energy into maximizing seed production with minimal input to individual propagules, whereas K-species allocate energy into a few, highly fit individuals; this is a spectrum of quantity versus quality. The model assumes that perfect r-species function under competitive-free environments with no density effects and K-species under maximum competitive and density saturation. Most species are categorized as intermediates between both extremes.  Summary  The term ‚Äúplant strategies‚Äù has many definitions, and includes several different mechanisms for responding to one's environment. While different strategies focus on different plant characteristics, all strategies have an overarching theme: plants must make trade-offs between where and how to allocate resources. Whether that's allocation to growth, reproduction, or maintenance, plants are responding to their environment by employing strategies that allow them to persist, survive, and reproduce. Plants may have multiple strategies to survive at different life-stages and therefore be subject to multiple trade-off throughout their life-cycle .

Having earned her degree in Switzerland, she briefly worked in Germany before becoming the first female physician in the Bosnian town of Banja Luka. She received highest decorations for her service during the First World War and social activism in Austria afterwards, but was deported to a Nazi concentration camp, where she died, during the Second World War.  Early life and education  Gisela Januszewska was born on 22 January 1867 in the Moravian village of Drnovice, then part of Austria-Hungary and now in the Czech Republic. She was one of five children of Leopold Rosenfeld, an estate manager in the Slavonian town of Grubi≈°no Polje. The family was Jewish, and were informally called Roda (Serbo-Croatian word for stork). Januszewska's younger brother Alexander, a satire writer, legally adopted that name. After attending a private school in Brno, she married the much older Joachim Kuhn. Feeling trapped in the marriage, she filed for a divorce within a few years. Januszewska then moved to Switzerland, where she took matura and enrolled the University of Z√ºrich. She received a degree in medicine as Gisela Kuhn on 12 April 1898. Career Having gained her first experience in the obstetrics volunteering at the Women's Hospital in Z√ºrich, Januszewska moved in June 1898 to Remscheid, German Empire, and became an insurance doctor for Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse. In March 1899, she was appointed Amts√§rztin, a public health official, in the Bosnian town of Banja Luka, becoming its first female physician. During her career in Banja Luka, Januszewska was one of few physicians who strove to ensure that Bosnian Muslim women had proper access to healthcare. Her initial supervisor there, the 20 years older Ladislaus Januszewski, became her second husband in 1900. Upon their marriage, Januszewska had to abandon her post as public health official. Instead she served as head of an outpatient clinic for Muslim women of Banja Luka. She performed minor surgeries and gained fame treating patients with smallpox, typhoid, typhus and syphilis, but most of all osteomalacia (the last being especially rampant among Muslim women, according to Teodora Krajewska, another physician in Bosnia at the time). Following Januszewski's retirement, the couple moved to Graz. She took up doctoral studies shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, enrolling the University of Graz. Widowed in 1916, she volunteered to enter the military medical corps as the only physician available to the Milit√§rkommando. Januszewska received several medals for her services, including German Red Cross Decoration and the Austrian Order of the Civil Merit. After the war, in 1919, she opened her own practice in Graz. Until 1933, she functioned as a panel physician for Styria and Carinthia's Association of Health Insurance. She was widely respected for her social responsibility: not only did she treat the underprivileged for free, she also financially supported some of them. She was the second Austrian physician to be awarded the title Medizinalrat, an award for outstanding contributions to medicine. Later life By the end of 1935, Januszewska had closed her practice, but continued her social work. In 1937, her work was rewarded with the Knight's Cross of the Order of Merit, Austria's highest honour. Within a year, however, Austria was invaded and annexed by Nazi Germany. Januszewska found herself a victim of its racial policy. Her Graz apartment was confiscated in 1940, and she was forced to move to Vienna, from where she was deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. She died there on 2 March 1943, aged 76.

It is a shrub with heart-shaped to round leaves and usually white flowers with purple spots inside the petal tube. Description Prostanthera prostantheroides is a small shrub that typically grows to a height of up to and has stems that become spiny with age. The leaves are heart-shaped to round, long and about wide on a very short petiole. The flowers are arranged at the ends of the branches on pedicels long with bracteoles long at the base but that fall off as the flower develops. The sepals form a tube long with two lobes, the upper lobe about wide and the lower lobe about wide. The petals are long, white with purple, mauve to violet or red spots inside, and form a tube about long. The lower middle lobe is about wide and the side lobes are about long and wide, the upper lobes long and wide. Flowering occurs in August, September or October. Taxonomy This species was first formally described in 1876 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Wrixonia prostantheroides in his book Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae, based on plant material collected from the vicinity of Mount Churchman by Jess Young. In 2012, Trevor Wilson, Murray Henwood and Barry Conn changed the name to Prostanthera prostantheroides in the journal Telopea.

Built in 1926, it was the lifelong home of environmentalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas (1890-1998), who was nationally known for her efforts to preserve the Everglades of southern Florida. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2015. Description and history The Douglas House is located in Miami's Coconut Grove neighborhood, on the south side of Stewart Avenue, a short way west of Southwest 37th Street. It is a single story wood frame structure, its exterior finished in a variety of surfaces, including half-timbered stucco, brick, and wooden timbering. It has a T-shaped plan, and stylistically resembles an English country cottage, with a curving roof made of steam-shaped wooden shingles. Exterior wood is typically cypress, and windows are irregularly placed. The house is set in a densely-planted yard, designed to afford some shade to the structure, and frequently obscuring its shape. The interior is finished in hardwood flooring, with plaster walls, and plaster ceilings with exposed beams. The house was built in 1926 to a design by architect George Hyde, creating what Douglas described as \\"a workshop, more than a house\\". It was here that she did much of her intellectual work and writing, including important works such as The Everglades: River of Grass, a seminal 1947 work describing the declining quality of the Everglades, even as some preservation actions were taking place, including the formation of Everglades National Park, a move that she championed. Douglas' home was a frequent meeting point for area conservationists. It was purchased by the state in 1991, as the home of \\"one of Florida's most distinguished citizens.\\" See also *List of National Historic Landmarks in Florida *National Register of Historic Places listings in Miami, Florida References National Historic Landmarks in Florida Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Florida Houses completed in 1926 Houses in Miami National Register of Historic Places in Miami 1926 establishments in Florida ","title":"Marjory Stoneman Douglas House"},{"id":"48765074","text":"Pauline Croft is an English historian, professor, and writer.

It is internationally renowned as one of the finest cannabis strains in Asia. This is a hybrid strain of cannabis which includes 80 percent India and 20 percent foreign, probably Amsterdam. History The strain landed in India during the '80s when various strains of cannabis landed in the area of Idukki in Kerala-Tamil Nadu border due to migration. The climate of the Western Ghats was ideal and the strain soon started spreading. Later, the strain received the name Idukki Gold. Known as Neelachadayan (blue locks) or Neelam in the native tongue. The strain was cultivated and first sold in various parts Kerala and Tamil Nadu. However, it soon found its way all the way to north India and many other countries. Extinction Throughout the years, there has been a gradual decline in its production. This is because of the continuous depletion of forests in that region due to rise in population and constant interference by law enforcement of Kerala and Tamil Nadu as the region is near to the border of both the states. Currently, the plantation occurs along the Andhra-Odisha border, an area controlled by Naxalism. However, the quality of this strain is much inferior.

Born in Nigeria to British expatriate parents, Guite earned degrees from Cambridge and Durham universities. His research interests include the intersection of religion and the arts, and the examination of the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, Owen Barfield, and British poets such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge. He is currently a Bye-Fellow and chaplain of Girton College, Cambridge and associate chaplain of St Edward King and Martyr in Cambridge. On several occasions, he has taught as visiting faculty at several colleges and universities in England and North America. Guite is the author of five books of poetry, including two chapbooks and three full-length collections, as well as several books on Christian faith and theology. Guite has a decisively simple, formalist style in poems, many of which are sonnets, and he stated that his aim is to \\"be profound without ceasing to be beautiful\\". Guite performs as a singer and guitarist fronting the Cambridgeshire-based blues, rhythm and blues, and rock band \\"Mystery Train\\".Mystery Train (official website). Retrieved 20 July 2015.  Early life and education  Guite was born on 12 November 1957 in Ibadan, Oyo State, in Nigeria. At birth, he was given the first name Ayodeji which is a Yoruba tribal name meaning \\"the second joy\\".Nathaniel Darling, Interview: Reverend Dr Malcolm Guite, Girton, The Cambridge Student (25 April 2014).

According to Guite, the name was suggested to his mother by the Yoruba nurse who attended to her through a difficult childbirth and whom Guite states probably saved both his and his mother's life. His parents were British expatriates living in Nigeria where his father was a Methodist lay preacher who travelled around the country proselytizing. His father also taught as lecturer in Classics at the University of Ibadan. According to Guite, after ten years in Nigeria, his father \\"ever the wanderer, went and got a job in Canada, where we then moved\\". Although his family had settled in Canada, his parents thought he was losing his British identity and decided to enroll him in boarding school in England where he spent his teenage years. He attended the Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School in Elstree, Hertfordshire. He would describe the boarding school experience as terrible, an \\"atmosphere of guilt, oppression and general alienation\\" where he strayed from his childhood Christian faith. In its place, Guite embraced a \\"rational scientific materialism\\" coloured by B.F. Skinner's behaviourism and the existentialism of Jean-Paul Sartre and Samuel Beckett. During these years, Guite states that he was not sure whether he belonged in England or in Canada, having questions about how he identified himself. In the end, however, he decided that he belonged in England after winning a scholarship to Pembroke College, Cambridge to read English and after discovering \\"real ale\\"‚Äîsomething he says \\"they don't have properly in Canada at all\\". Guite adds that after these two events he \\"fell in love with Cambridge, and I've never quite escaped its gravitational pull\\". Guite returned gradually to his Christian faith, first under the influence of beauty in the poetry of John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley and visits to historical sites that had deep religious significance‚ÄîRome, Glen Colmcille, and Scotland's Iona. After delving into the works of Keats and Shelley, Guite decided to begin writing poetry. In his final year of undergraduate study, Guite states that he had a religious experience writing a literary paper analysing the Psalms that he likened to a conversion experience. He chose to be confirmed in the Church of England shortly after. Guite graduated from Cambridge with a Bachelor of Arts (BA)‚Äîlater automatically upgraded to Master of Arts (MA (Cantab))‚Äîin English Literature in 1980.Girton College, University of Cambridge, Malcolm Guite, Chaplain (faculty page). Retrieved 19 July 2015. After graduating, Guite taught for several years as a secondary school teacher before deciding to seek a doctoral degree, and obtained his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) from Durham University degree in 1993.

Concerning Guite's collection Sounding the Seasons, poet and literary critic Grevel Lindop remarked: \\"using the sonnet form with absolute naturalness as he traces the year and its festivals, he offers the reader‚Äîwhether Christian or not‚Äîprofound and beautiful utterance which is patterned but also refreshingly spontaneous\\". Guite has stated that his aim is to \\"be profound without ceasing to be beautiful\\". Further he has argued that a poet can discuss emotions like sorrow without having to lose form, and specifically that the goal of his style contrasts a lot of modern poetry which he states tends to be \\"quite difficult, jagged and rebarbative; a lot of modern poetry deliberately eschews form or beauty, and is almost deliberately trying to put the reader off.\\" Citing these difficulties, Guite recounted that his entry into poetry was aided by engaging the lyrics of singer-songwriters Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen.

WIA has chapters in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York City, Dublin, Pune, and Toronto. WIA states that the lack of an equal number of women and men in the animation profession is because \\"there has been very little work to intentionally change the status quo.\\" In order to help women enter the animation profession, WIA has created a mentorship program, a voice over group, a scholarship, talks, and events. The organization is currently led by its president, Margaret Dean.  History  WIA was founded in 1995 by producer and journalist Rita StreetSpeaker, Kidscreen Summit 2015 and animator Phyllis Craig. Craig had worked in several animation studios like Disney, Hanna-Barbera and Marvel, taking numerous roles as a painter, inker, and color key artist. She spoke about having difficulty becoming an animator in Disney, due to the common belief that only men can be animators, and women be strictly painters and inkers. After Craig's death in May 18th, 1997, WIA created a scholarship called \\"The Phyllis Craig Scholarship Fund\\". Margaret Dean and Kristy Scanlan took over as co-presidents of WIA in 2013, increasing the membership from 120 to 800 active members in January 2015. Currently, Dean is the president of WIA. WIA has since created more programs, one called ‚Äú50/50 by 2025‚Äù, a pledge people can sign to show support for closing the job gap for women in the animation industry. Another pledge called the ‚ÄúAnimation Studio Anti-Harassment Pledge‚Äù (ASAP), advocates for safer and nondiscriminatory workplaces for women animators. WIA also holds yearly mentorship programs, where mentees can apply to learn from animators experienced in the industry.  Gender Disparity in the Animation Industry  Although female animators have come a long way from the time when Disney sent out rejection letters stating, ‚ÄúWomen do not do any of the creative work in connection with preparing the cartoons for the screen, as that work is performed entirely by young men‚Äù, the climate shift within the animation industry is progressing very slowly. During the 1930s, women were only employed as inkers and painters at Disney. They were discouraged from being animators and were not permitted inside the animation building unless it concerned business. It was not until 1941, with the outbreak of war, that Disney started training women in animation to maintain a pool of workers while the men had gone to war. Today, according to Los Angeles Magazine, 70% of animation students from CalArts Valencia campus, 66% of animation students from UCLA, and 55% of animation students from USC are all female. Despite the rapidly growing female population studying animation, industry statistics still reflect poorly from achieving gender parity. The Animation Guild, I.A.T.S.E. Local 839, is a union representing over 4000 animation artists, writers, and technicians in Los Angeles. Based on its data, in 2015, 20.6% of Guild workers were women. The number increased to 23.2% in 2016, and finally hit the quarter milestone of 25.6% in 2018. While there appears to be an uprising number of female professionals in the industry, a closer look into 2015 statistics in key areas of animation shows only 1% of women were art directors, 3% were directors, and 5% were writers. As of 2019, the number of female executives in animation has risen to more than half, and 39% in TV. However, female directors make up 3% for animated films, while women of color make up to only 1%.  Events  WIA has hosted over 100 events. Examples of some of the events hosted by WIA include: \\"WIA Conversations\\" (Tara Strong gave this talk on Nov. 19, 2015), \\"Voices in the Room\\", \\"The WIA Mentorship Experience\\", as well as many other kinds of events and talks. WIA also has hosted movie screenings, panels, workshops, and \\"Monthly Networking Mixers\\". In 2014, WIA kicked off its first mentoring program, which was open to members of WIA in the Los Angeles area. The mentoring program has continued into the present. The program is intended to help mentees have greater \\"industry knowledge and access to information through relationships with experienced professionals. WIA hosts various activities and efforts aimed at raising awareness of women in the animation industry. In 2015, WIA hosted a panel on women in animation, presenting such statistics as while 60% of students studying animation in several Los Angeles animation schools are women, only 20% of working animators are content creators, rather than support staff. On November 22, 2015, WIA had a booth and a talk at the CTN Animation Expo. People interested in WIA signed their names on a huge poster featuring their logo behind their booth. Floyd Norman also showed his support for WIA by signing his name on the poster. The subject of the discussion of the talk at CTN was ‚Äú50/50 by 2025‚Äù (#5050by2025) which discussed the subject of getting the ratio of female to male animators working in the industry to 50% (equal) by the year 2025. Another goal of 50/50 by 2025 is to \\"bring about more varied and positive representations on screen.\\"  Scholarships  Phyllis Craig's death inspired the creation of an annual $1,000 scholarship fund called \\"The Phyllis Craig Scholarship Fund\\" (PCSF) in her honor, the deadline being April 29, Craig's birthday. WIA has also created an annual \\"Women in Animation Scholarship Program\\" to financially support students pursuing animation. Out of 83 applicants from 44 schools, the scholarship was given to eight students. The 2020 scholarship pool totaled $15,000, while also providing a program reward from Animation Mentor and Toon Boom.  List of famous female animators  List of famous female animators includes some of the world's most prominent and top-ranked female animators. Today, the number of females in the animation sector has increased rapidly. However, this list includes the names some of the best female animators like Sophie Merry, Faith Hubley, Arlene Klasky, Kate Sullivan, Janet Perlman, Caroline leaf, Nina Paley, Emily Hubley, and so on.

The burial ground was expanded twice. In 1820, Daniel Stuart (died 1822) deeded a 0.4-acre (0.16 ha) parcel along the graveyard's northeast. In 1837, Job and Ann Halstead conveyed a parcel of to the town's Presbyterian church \\"for a place of interment of the dead free for all persons desirous of Burying upon the said lot of land\\". In that year, the entire graveyard was enclosed by a stone wall (previously it was bound by \\"wooden coping\\"). Approximately of this wall was removed in 1966 and replaced with chain-link fence. The cemetery's entrance is through a gate on the Main Street featuring double-leaf cast-iron entry gates. The gates were decorated with \\"medallions, bearing a bas-relief of Father Time with scythe and hourglass\\" of which one of the two survive. The burial ground contains the graves of the members of several families who were involved in the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century settlement and growth of Newton and the surrounding areas.

He envisioned having all of these ancient burial grounds cleared with a sign placed in them designating the name of the cemetery and conveying the impression that someone cared about it and those laid to rest. Eventually a plan was presented to the sheriff and jail warden to have the cemeteries cleared by prisoners. Prior to any work performed in the cemeteries, however, ownership of them needed to be established. With that requirement, Longcore spent countless hours in the hall of records in an attempt to discover who owned the cemeteries and to contact the next of kin if possible to secure their permission to have the prisoners clean out the cemeteries. Under this plan, about 30 cemeteries were cleared by the SWAP (Sheriff's Work Assistance Program) with daffodils planted in many of them.\\" The burial ground is adjacent to the Negro Burial Ground, a property bequeathed by Thomas Ryerson.Note: The Negro Burial Ground is also overseen by the Newton Cemetery Company.

Prior to this post he served as the agha (local commander) of Ma'arrat al-Nu'man and steadily moved up the ranks to become the governor of the districts of Ma'arrat al-Nu'man, Hama and Homs in 1719 and then governor of Tripoli in 1721 before being assigned to the Damascus governorship. His consistent promotion was attributed to his successes in restoring order to the Syrian countryside after a period of high instability, protecting Syria's farmlands from Bedouin raids and ensuring the safety of the annual Hajj pilgrim caravan to Mecca. Although he was deposed from the governorship in 1730, he established his family, al-Azm, as a major political household in Syria whose members were frequently appointed as the governors of the Damascus, Tripoli and Sidon provinces and who often served longer than typical terms. Early career in central Syria Ismail was the son of a professional Ottoman soldier, Ibrahim al-'Azm, \\"a rural notable possibly of Turkish stock\\", who was sent to Ma'arrat al-Nu'man to restore order in the mid-seventeenth century;Barbir 1980, p. 59. Ismail was known as \\"Ibn al-Azm\\" (Son of al-Azm) and early in his career as \\"Ismail Agha\\".Douwes 2000, p. 45. He is first mentioned in the history records in 1717, when, as the agha (local military commander) of Ma'arra, he sent wheat and barley provisions to Homs after that city faced a food shortage following an attack by Bedouin raiders. In 1719, he was appointed the mutasallim (district governor) of the Ma'arra, Homs and Hama sanjaks (districts); Ma'arra was part of Aleppo Eyalet, while Homs and Hama were part of Tripoli Eyalet. Ismail was charged with repopulating villages that had been abandoned due to Bedouin raids and restoring order in the districts. In late 1719, the central authorities commanded him to forcibly settle the nomadic and frequently rebellious Turkmen tribesmen of the region in villages in his territory.Douwes 2000, pp. 46‚Äì47. Al-Azm was able to bring order and peace to the districts through forming local alliances and with the support of Aleppo's wali (provincial governor). The latter used his influence to persuade the Sublime Porte (Ottoman imperial government) to send Ismail imperial troops to rein in the nomadic Turkmen and Mawali tribes. The Sublime Porte also granted Ismail and his family certain privileges that guaranteed them significant income. Ismail's restoration of order amid instability marked by frequent Bedouin raids, infighting among various military forces and the brutality of local administrators, gained him a \\"reputation as a resolute but just and even generous ruler\\", according to historian Dick Douwes. The 18th-century Homs- based chronicler Muhammad al-Makki praised Ismail's rule and prayed that \\"God give him strength and make him stand firm and prolong his rule and deliver him and his troops from his enemies\\". Although his appointment was for seven years, by his second year in office, in 1721, Ismail was promoted as wali of Tripoli Eyalet, and was thereafter known as \\"Ismail Pasha\\". During his term, he successfully protected Muslim pilgrim convoys on their way to Damascus, from where they would begin their departure to Mecca to perform the Hajj. Ismail Pasha also ensured that the towns of Tripoli Eyalet had sufficient food supplies and he protected the province's farmlands from harvest thieves.Douwes 2000, p. 48. This contrasted with the other governors of Tripoli, who typically neglected their duties in the Homs and Hama districts due to the challenge posed in those regions by frequent Bedouin depredations. During Ismail Pasha's time in office, the central authorities granted him a malik√¢ne (leasehold for life) over the sanjak of Hama, while the town of Hama became the countryside headquarters of the al-Azm family after they moved there from Ma'arra.Douwes 2000, p. 49. Wali of Damascus Ismail Pasha was transferred to the governorship of Damascus Eyalet in 1725, after a revolt in the city against Wali √áerkes Osman Pasha.Barbir 1980, p. 85. He was replaced by his brother Sulayman Pasha al-Azm in Tripoli, while one of his sons was appointed mutasallim of Hama. As wali of Damascus, he was tasked with bringing order to the Syrian interior from Ma'arra in the north to the eastern bank of the Jordan River in the south. He was also concurrently appointed amir al-hajj and was thus responsible for the safety and provisioning of the annual Hajj caravan from Damascus to Mecca. In his first four years (1725‚Äì1729) as amir al-hajj, Ismail Pasha successfully countered four attempted Bedouin raids against the caravan.Barbir 1980, p. 177. Throughout his term in Damascus, Ismail Pasha appointed members of his family or their close associates as the mutasallims of Hama, Homs and Ma'arra. He established lucrative monopolies as governor,Burns 2005, p. 240.Bidwell 1998, p. 58. including on sheep from Hama, and was responsible for a number of building works in the city of Damascus. Ismail Pasha was dismissed from the governorship in late 1730 when the Sublime Porte accused him of embezzling money slated for provisioning the Hajj caravan. However, this charge was deemed \\"dubious\\" by historian Karl Barbir.Barbir 1980, p. 157. Ismail Pasha was likely dismissed due to the ousting of Sultan Ahmed III in a coup and the consequent dismissal of provincial governors appointed under Ahmed's administration. In addition to his imprisonment in the Citadel of Damascus, Ismail Pasha's properties were seized by the authorities, while his brother Sulayman Pasha was dismissed from the Tripoli governorship. However, in 1731, Ismail Pasha and Sulayman Pasha were pardoned.Douwes 2000, p. 50. Ismail Pasha was appointed wali of Crete Eyalet in 1731 and served until 1732. Sulayman Pasha would later succeed Ismail as wali of Damascus in 1734.Barbir 1980, p. xv. Legacy Ismail Pasha established the foundations of the al-Azm family's prominence in Syria as the most powerful political household in the provinces of Damascus, Sidon and Tripoli in the 18th century. Between 1725 and 1757, the al-Azm family nearly monopolized the offices of wali of Damascus and amir al-hajj.Douwes 2000, pp. 48‚Äì49. The frequent and consecutive appointments of al-Azm members to Damascus contrasted with the traditionally short, typically one-year-long, terms that most governors of Damascus served. The fact that the al-Azms were from Syria also differed from the mostly non-Syrian officials who traditionally filled the post of wali of Damascus.Abi-Mershed 2010, p. 43. During those years, the al-Azm family was able to prevent Bedouin raids against Syrian villages and maintained the protection of grain harvests and the grain supply to Damascus. Among the al-Azm governors that succeeded Ismail Pasha was his son As'ad Pasha al-Azm, who ruled longer than any other wali of Damascus, serving for 14 consecutive years.

Designed by Philippe Prost and inaugurated on November 11, 2014, the 96th anniversary of Armistice Day, the memorial honors the 576,606 soldiers of forty different nationalities who died at Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The memorial is located at the site of the national cemetery of Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. The monument consists of 500 metal panels that are arranged in an ellipse pattern, each 3 meters (almost 10 ft) in height. Each panel contains approximately 1200 names of fallen soldiers, listed alphabetically by last name. The 500th panel remains blank so that any newly discovered names may be inscribed. The most noteworthy aspect of the Ring of Memory is that it is the first memorial to list alphabetically, with no regard to rank nor nationality.  Description  The memorial consists of an 1132-foot perimeter ellipse (about the length of 3.75 football fields) constructed out of stainless steel panels and concrete, with a 200-foot portion elevated off of the ground. The panels are arranged facing inwards on the ring and list the 579,606 casualties in Nord-Pas-de-Calais between 1914 and 1918. Each of the 500 panels is 10 feet in height, and is engraved with the names of approximately 1,200 men, with the 500th panel remaining blank so that any newly discovered names may be inscribed. The names are listed alphabetically, rather than by nationality, starting with ‚ÄúA, Tet‚Äù and concluding with ‚ÄúZschiesche, Paul‚Äù. It resides around 550 feet away from France‚Äôs largest military cemetery at Ablain Saint-Nazaire, the site of the three Battles of Artois  History  The monument was built in Nord-Pas-de- Calais, on a plot of 5.4 acres of land on a hill 541 feet high, which was commonly referred to as the ‚Äúbloody hill‚Äù. Nord-Pas-de-Calais is historically a strategic military location in both World Wars. Not only was it a major component of the Western Front, but is also rich in resources such as coal. The monument accurately names 579,606 of the soldiers who died on this front from 1914 to 1918. The names on the monument were compiled from mainly German, British, and French archives. It sits 180 yards from Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, France‚Äôs largest military cemetery.  Inauguration  The monument was chosen in a public contest and was set to be built on April 13, 2011. It was designed by French designer, Philippe Prost. The monument was inaugurated in an Armistice Day celebration on November 11, 2014 by French president, Fran√ßois Hollande. The Nord-Pas-de-Calais r√©gion pr√©sident, Daniel Percheron and the German Minister of Defense, Ursula von der Leyen, were also in attendance of the inauguration ceremony. Neither the German Chancellor nor the British Prime Minister were in attendance.  Significance  On the source of his inspiration, Prost explains, ‚ÄúI was thinking about the rings you make when you‚Äôre a child, or a human ring when everyone holds each others‚Äô hands in a sign of fellowship, and that seemed to me like the image, the form best suited to speaking about these 600,000 soldiers killed in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region, and who today are brought together all in one place.‚Äù The elliptical shape of the monument captures this sentiment and evokes a sense of ‚Äúposthumous fraternity‚Äù and unity among countries that were once enemies. It draws no lines, makes no distinctions, and instead recognizes a common and inclusive humanity. The memorial invokes a sense of European loss rather than strictly national loss. The ring symbolizes eternity and the continuous cycle of birth and death. The materials used to construct the ring, stainless steel and concrete, are materials that will withstand the passing of time, which further reinforces the sense of eternity. While the ring is a symbol of the current peace in Europe, part of it hangs precariously over the hillside, reminding the visitors that peace is not always stable and conflict can return at any time. Hanging over a slope ¬© Carolin Hahnemann The Ring of Memory is the only memorial that lists names alphabetically with no distinctions in rank, nationality, or allegiance. Prost stresses, ‚ÄúNo ranks, no nationalities: just a dizzying list of the human stories that ended on France‚Äôs northern battlefields.‚Äù The names of friends and foes are engraved together in order to establish a theme of forgiveness and reconciliation after the conflict.  Related Memorials  In its design, the Ring of Memory is both similar and different to other famous war memorials. Like the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., it lists the soldiers without distinction for rank or nationality, although the Vietnam Veterans Memorial lists the names chronologically, not alphabetically. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial is also made of black granite, not steel, so the polished surface reflects the memorial‚Äôs surroundings and those standing in front of it. The National World War II Memorial, also located in Washington, D.C., is similarly shaped like a ring, but it is sunken below ground level instead of above it, and uses golden stars to denote the number of casualties instead of lists of names. Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, an art installation constructed in the Tower of London to commemorate the centenary of World War I, also used symbolism to represent the number of casualties sustained by the British Empire and the Commonwealth, but also did not make distinction for rank or nationality. The Arc de Triomphe, another French war memorial, is distinctly different from the Ring, as it only lists high-ranking officers from the French army according to their rank, and not any enlisted men. The Arc de Triomphe also only denotes a casualty by underlining the dead soldier‚Äôs name.

It was also considered the \\"best journal of its kind in the world market\\" after the First World War. The lifestyle magazine began in 1911 and ended in 1943. Die Dame consisted of essays, illustrations, and photography. The magazine was most active during the shift from the early 1920s, when the magazine celebrated the independent The New Woman, to the mid 1920s when women were portrayed as cold and masculine uniformity.  History  In 1912, the Berlin publishing House Ullstein bought out Illustrierte Frauen-Zeitung (English: Illustrated Women's Newspaper) because the company founder Leopold Ullstein's five sons had already recognized that many women were affluent consumers but that Ullstein had no products specifically for them. The newspaper's content was thrifty advice on fashion and housekeeping. In 1912, the Illustrierte Frauen-Zeitung became Die Dame. 1920-1925 In the early 1920s, the magazine promoted independent and career driven women. Most of the original fashion layouts and cover pages were created by mostly female designers and artists such as Erica Mohr, Hanna Goerke, Martha Sparkuhl, Julie Haase-Werkenthin, Gerda Bunzel, and Steffie Nathan. Renowned male commentators such as writer Friedrich Freksa and costume historian Max von Boehn were granted a large amount of space in Die Dame. The article discussed the phenomenon of fashion within a broader and cultural-historical frame in hopes of enlightening women. In 1923, Petra Fiedler, the daughter of the well-known modernist architect Peter Behrens, joined Die Dames design team which caused the magazine to become more popular.  1925-1930  In 1925, a Viennese designer, Ernst Dryden, was named chief artistic director of Die Dame , which caused a shift from the previous positive tone of modernity. In 1925-26, Arthur Schnitzler's Traumnovelle (English: Rhapsody: A Dream Novel) was serialized in Die Dame before being published in book form. By 1927 the photographs of female fashion editors and illustrators disappeared from the pages. Their work was given less and less visible space in the magazine, while Dryden's drawings and essay took over the magazine. His fashion layouts denied the individualization of the modern women, showing geometrical silhouettes arranged in a chorus line. In his works illustrated that women's experience of fashion are completely detached from the understanding of everyday life. They carried the markers of self-centered arrogance that invited many critics of the New Woman to misunderstand the New Woman.  After 1930  In 1930, Dryden produced a cover design showing an elegant woman clutching a dog and standing in front of a Bugatti. His cover for November 1928 showing a languid beauty in the middle of a vast circle of sports cars all pointed lustfully towards her, is an image of the Jazz age Woman to match celebrity, Tamara's iconic self-portrait. Die Dame continued to be published under Nazi rule even though their publishing house, Ullstein, was expropriated because it was a Jewish family enterprise. Helen Grund was one of the few fashion journalists of the 1920s whose careers remained. Die Dame was finally discontinued two years before the end of the war because, as the edition stated, \\"manpower and material need to be freed up for other purposes in the interests of the war economy.\\"  Readership  There is no reliable information about the magazine's readership, but the publisher's concept and price suggest that it circulated among women of the middle and upper-middle classes. A single issue of the journal, which by 1939 had reached a circulation of 32,870, cost 1.50 Reichmarks in the 1920s, ten times the cost of a copy of the popular daily newspaper Berliner Tageblatt. Die Dame was publicized by Ullstein as \\"the society magazine with an international reputation\\" and the German luxury magazine with the highest circulation (50,890) in 1929.  Historical context  In World War I, the men had gone to the battlefields and women had to take over the men's jobs. They worked in war factories, hospitals, farms, shops, and single-handedly cared for the children. When the men came back from the war, some of the women resented being pushed back into domestic jobs. By early 1921, there was a labor shortage and the women were enticed to go back to work. Women's labor and female workers had become widely noticeable since World War I. This caused social disruption and gender recasting. In addition, women were granted the right to vote.  Challenging gender roles  In 1926, Die Dame introduced the spring fashion season with a manipulation of traditional gender roles: sketches of female models in smoking jackets and short masculine haircuts and are accompanied by male models who dress in a similar fashion. Although this representation of the New Woman was frequently condemned for reinforcing the \\"masculinization\\" of female gender identity, it considered sexual mobility between femininity and masculinity to be the distinguishing feature of women's fashion. In a fashion layout in 1926, the female figures retain feminine styles in their ruffled shirts and ribbon bow ties but appropriate at the same time as excess of masculine styles in their dinner suits and waistcoats which deemphasize the body.

It lives in warm waters in the Caribbean Sea and off the south and southeastern coast of the United States, where it feeds on seaweed. Description Aplysia morio is a bulky sea slug that can grow to a length of or more. It is usually dark chocolate brown to blackish in colour, and sometimes dark lines are visible on the head and flanks. The tentacles are curled and shaped rather like rabbit's ears. They are rich in nerve cells and are equipped with receptor organs. The shell is a fragile disc, hidden within the mantle, and the foot has large flaps at the side called parapodia which are used for swimming. Distribution and habitat This species is found in the semi-tropical western Atlantic Ocean. Its range includes the eastern coast of the United States, Bermuda, the West Indies, Florida, the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and Venezuela. It typically lives in shallow water, down to depths of about in areas where there is little wave action. It is usually found on rocky surfaces among the algae that it feeds on, but is also found on sandy seabeds. Ecology Aplysia morio feeds on algae. In Bermuda juveniles seem to feed almost exclusively on species of the red alga Laurencia, even though there is a wide range of algae to choose from. Adults widen their diet slightly to include Palmaria palmata. The animal either crawls over the seaweed or rears up to grasp the fronds with its radula and the odontophore (cartilage) that supports it. It may also swim, in a manner reminiscent of a manta ray, when looking for food. An adult is a hermaphrodite that can act as a male and a female at the same time. As the penis of one individual is inserted into the genital opening of another, chains or clusters of mating sea hares can form. The initially spawning individual releases chemical signals that can trigger spawning in others, which may culminate in a mass spawning event. Fertilized eggs hatch and develop into veliger larvae, which drift with the plankton for at least a month and settle onto Laurencia seaweed.

Isar-Damu fought a long war with Mari which ended in Eblaite victory; he was probably the last king of the first kingdom. Reign Isar-Damu succeeded his father Irkab-Damu as a young child; his mother, Dusigu, seems to have taken advantage of her position as her husband favorite consort and her probable familial relation to the powerful vizier Ibrium in order to elevate her son to the throne, despite him being one of Irkab-Damu youngest sons. The first years of Isar-Damus's reign were dominated by his mother and the vizier; texts from Ebla show that Isar-Damu's name appeared on official documents after that of his mother. Ibrium was the commander of the army and he conducted multiple campaigns against rebellious vassal-rulers or neighboring kingdoms. Isar-Damu concluded an alliance with Nagar and the relations progressed toward a dynastic marriage between princess Tagrish-Damu, Isar- Damu's daughter, and prince Ultum-Huhu, Nagar's monarch's son. In year seven of Ibrium's term, Nagar was defeated by Mari, causing the blockage of trade routes between Ebla and southern Mesopotamia via upper Mesopotamia. Ibrium became vizier two years prior to Isar-Damu reign and kept his office for 20 years dying in Isar-Damu's 18th regnal year; three years later, queen mother Dusigu died. Following Ibrium's death, an Eblaite campaign was sent against Alalakh. Isar-Damu concluded an alliance with Nagar and Kish against Mari, and the campaign was headed by the Eblaite vizier Ibbi-Sipish, Ibrium's son, who led the combined armies to victory in a battle near Terqa. Afterwards, the alliance attacked the rebellious Eblaite vassal city of Armi.

She became the first Lithuanian woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest, on 22 May 2013.  Biography  Edita Horrell is a humanitarian aid worker employed by the World Food Programme (WFP), whom she has worked for since 2010. She has been deployed to Haiti, Niger, the Philippines, South Sudan, Zambia, Guinea, Nepal, Ecuador, Chad and the Central African Republic. She began her career as a mountaineer following her ascent of Kilimanjaro in 2010. She has made successful ascents of three 8000m peaks - Cho Oyu, Manaslu and Everest. She survived an avalanche on Manaslu in 2012, when she was catapulted for several metres inside her tent. She made two unsuccessful attempts on a fourth 8000m peak, Lhotse, in 2014 and 2015. Both of these expeditions were cut short by major tragedies. In 2015 she narrowly avoided another avalanche at Everest Base Camp, when a 7.8-magnitude earthquake caused a serac to collapse on nearby Pumori. After the earthquake, she spent two months in Nepal working on the emergency response for the World Food Programme. In 2014 she was part of an international team which measured and identified Mafinga Central as the highest point in Zambia. In 2016 she was mountaineering in Ecuador when another 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck. Once again she remained in the country to assist with the humanitarian response for WFP. In September 2017 she made what is believed to be the first ever ascent of Chimborazo from sea to summit, starting from Guayaquil, then completing a full circuit of the mountain before climbing to the summit.

It was released digitally on November 18, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux, and was released for the Nintendo Switch on March 7, 2019. Setting Hard West takes place in a heavily fictionalized version of the American Old West following standards of the Western genre but with the addition of supernatural elements, taking inspirations from XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Themes typical of the Western genre, such as bank robberies, lynching and the gold rush are commonplace in the game's world but also metaphysical beings such as Death and the Devil directly influence the lives of the local population. Creatures such as demons, ghosts and undead gunslingers are present in the game's vision of the old west.  Gameplay  The game is divided into two strictly separate modes, turn-based tactical encounters and a strategic exploration map where the player can travel a map and visit locations. Location visits on the strategic map are presented via simple text panels accompanied by static illustrations and allow the player to perform actions by picking entries from a list. This way players can interact with characters, perform a variety of custom actions, hire new characters into the player character's posse or initiate trade or combat. Hard West's tactical gameplay largely follows the standards set by XCOM: Enemy Unknown. During combat every character starts each turn with two action points which can be spent on either a move or shot each, although most weapons instantly end a character's turn upon being fired. The game also uses a cover system based on two cover types which lower the chance to get hit and damage received. Low barriers constitute \\"half cover\\" and barriers taller than a character constitute \\"full cover\\", the latter providing more protection. A major difference from most other turn-based tactical games is the absence of randomness in Hard West's core gameplay. Rather than relying on random number generation to determine hits, characters are given a luck attribute. Luck is reduced by the hit chance of a shot and a character is hit if a shot depletes his luck. Luck is replenished upon getting hit. At point-blank range every shot automatically hits. Over the course of the game characters can be improved and given special abilities, some of which are active and can be used instead of moving or firing while others are passive. Instead of relying on experience points and skill trees Hard West uses a custom system based on poker cards. After every tactical encounter or performing pre-defined actions on the strategic map the player is rewarded with unique poker cards which can be assigned to characters, each of them providing a different bonus. Arranging cards in poker hands yields additional bonuses. A controversial aspect of Hard West's gameplay is the reaction shot which replaces the overwatch mechanic of XCOM. Approaching an enemy up to point-blank range makes him automatically fire at the approaching player character if he could already see the player character before executing the move. Player characters are not protected from enemies by a reaction shot.  Development  Development on Hard West began before the release of CreativeForge Games' previous game, the sci-fi RTS game Ancient Space, and was first publicly announced in the context of its crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter in August 2014 which quickly found support from well-known game developers such as John Romero and Brian Fargo. It had a goal of $70,000 CAD and reached $94,183 CAD pledged by 4,398 backers. On July 30, 2015 the developers announced that Gambitious Digital Entertainment would publish the game and soon-after announced a release set for November 4. On October 30 Gambitious announced that the release would be delayed by two weeks and the game was ultimately released on Steam on November 18, 2015. A limited physical release distributed by CDP.pl, including the soundtrack and a comic book, followed in early 2016. In February 2016 development of DLC titled Scars of Freedom was announced which would move away from the supernatural themes of the base game towards Frankenstein-esque Gothic horror. It was also announced that the character customization system would be replaced with a new one based on harvesting organs and ether. The DLC was released on Steam and GOG.com on March 3, 2016. Reception Aggregate review website Metacritic assigned it a score of 73/100 based on 42 critic reviews. Vince Ingenito from IGN awarded it a score of 7.3/10, saying \\"Hard West trades some tactical grit for a touch of mystical fun, and a flair for the supernatural.\\" Tyler Wilde of PC Gamer awarded it a score of 6.1/10, saying \\"The presentation is aced, but Hard West's turn-based combat is too rote to be engrossing.\\" Zack Fumiss from Destructoid awarded it a score of 5/10, saying \\"What I'd really like to see is a tabletop game in this setting, because it honestly feels like it might be better suited in that realm. Either way, I hope there'll be a reason to come back. Brett Todd of GameSpot awarded it 7/10, saying \\"Tactical combat fans and horror buffs alike will find a lot to like here in both the spooky surroundings and the shoot-em-up scenarios.\\" References 2015 video games Crowdfunded video games Kickstarter-funded video games Linux games MacOS games Nintendo Switch games Single-player video games Turn-based tactics video games Unity (game engine) games Video games developed in Poland Western (genre) video games Windows games ","title":"Hard West"},{"id":"48765647","title":"Duncan Robinson (basketball)"},{"id":"48765666","text":"Revenge of the Dreamers II is the second compilation album by American record label Dreamville Records and was released on December 8, 2015.

Mission DSPD's stated mission is \\"to promote opportunities and provide supports for persons with disabilities to lead self-determined lives.\\" To accomplish this mission, DSPD has outlined six goals: # Promote and recognize excellence # Continue a person-centered philosophy # Promote public awareness of disability issues # Work collaboratively to dissolve barriers to quality service # Support a full spectrum of service options # Support self- determination by assisting persons to exercise and develop their ability to make choices and to experience: #* Freedom to make informed choices from among available options of services and support #* Authority to control a defined amount of dollars to purchase only what is needed and valued #* Support to nurture informal relationships that might augment, if not replace, some purchased services #* Responsibility to give back to the community  Services  DSPD provides support for people with disabilities in many different categories. These can include, but are not limited to: # Behavior supports # Companion services # Financial management services # Professional parent supports (e.g., group homes) # Respite care # Supported employment # Transportation services  Eligibility  Persons eligible for these services have qualifying disabilities in one of four areas: # Intellectual disabilities or related conditions # Acquired brain injury # Physical disabilities # Autism The majority of services are outsourced to Private Contractors, however the DSPD also manages the Utah State Developmental Center (USDC). The USDC, an intermediate care facility for people with intellectual disabilities, provides services in recreation, psychology, social work, and work programs. This 24-hour facility is primarily for people with more severe intellectual disabilities and is focused on active treatment and vocational programs.  History  The Utah Division of Health established the Office of Handicapped Services in 1979. Four years later, the Department of Social Services merged that office with the Department of Developmental Disabilities and Mental Retardation to form the currently named Division of Services for People With Disabilities. For the next 34 years, major changes occurred in DSPD in the form of waivers and legislation. These changes and a brief description are listed below: # Waiver Authority (1981) ‚Äì allows the agency to provide community-based programs instead of institutions and still be in compliance with federal statutory requirements. # Community Supports Waiver (1986) ‚Äì allows the agency to provide home and community-based services at home and not just in institutions. # Acquired Brain Injury Waiver (1995) ‚Äì allows the agency to provide home and community-based services for people with an acquired brain injury. # Physical Disability Waiver (1998) ‚Äì allows the agency to provide home and community-based services for people with physical disabilities. # Lisa P. v. Angus (1993) ‚Äì a lawsuit filed seeking community placement in \\"least restrictive and most enabling environment\\" for residents of the USDC. # Portability of Funding for Health and Human Services (1998) ‚Äì legislation enables individuals with disabilities to receive funding to move them out of institutions and into the community. # Olmstead v. L.C. (1999) ‚Äì the outcome led to the removal of many individuals with disabilities from institutional settings to community-based programs.

Design and construction Designed in Florence for the Rete Adriatica by engineers such as Enrico Plancher and Giuseppe Zara, the Class 600 was meant to pull both passenger and freight trains on the steep and curvy Italian lines at a reasonable speed. It introduced several novelties in Italian locomotive practice, the most notable of which is undoubtedly the Italian bogie: a derivation of the German Krauss-Helmholtz bogie, it was meant to ensure good performance in curves without requiring a four-wheel bogie; it proved very successful, and it would become a staple of Italian steam locomotives. Another notable feature was the application of the Walschaerts valve gear on a locomotive with internal cylinders but outside piston valves, coupled with a compound engine. The arrangement would return on other locomotive classes such as the Class 630 and the Class 745. The first 50 locomotives were built with a boiler that allowed for a power output of ; the remaining locomotives were built with bigger boilers (also refitted to some of the earlier locomotives over the years) that gave them a higher value of . Some of the first locomotives were numbered under the RA and the SFM (Strade Ferrate Meridionali) ownership, until they were absorbed by the Ferrovie dello Stato respectively in 1905 and 1906; two more, built for the Valsugana valley railway, were taken over by the FS in 1912. In all, 248 locomotives were built between 1904 and 1908. All were fitted with a standard six-wheeled tender. Service and conversions The Class 600 proved very successful in service, and paved the way for their simple-expansion and superheated derivatives of the Class 625. In 1927, the 600.168 was rebuilt with a superheated 625 boiler, and was reclassified as 601.168. However, the experiment was not followed on, and it was preferred, starting from 1929, to outright convert the locomotives to Class 625 status. In all, 153 locomotives were converted to 625.3XX until 1933. The remaining unrebuilt Class 600 locomotives were gradually withdrawn before 1940.

A friend of Amalie Sieveking, whose charitable work she continued, she is regarded as a figure typical of the Erweckung, the socially active Christian revival sweeping through Germany in the 19th century. The first half of her life she was a teacher, a writer, and a nurse; only in the second half of her life did she become a deaconess and led a small community of like-minded women. Averdieck grew up in a Hamburg where poverty had increased greatly since the beginning of the 19th century, and although there were both state-supported and private initiatives to alleviate the fate of the poor, these efforts were not well coordinated and were frequently based on completely different ideas on what caused poverty, and what it meant. For Averdieck, poverty came from God and was thus a blessing in its own right. Though she considered the experience of poverty to be educational, she did not feel the plight of poverty needn't be improved, and among those who, like her, came to social work through Lutheran piety, this was a strong imperative to act.  Biography  Averdieck was the second daughter of the wealthy Hamburg merchant Georg Friedrich Averdieck (1774‚Äì1839). Her brother Edward (1810‚Äì82) was an architect. Besides two years spent in Berlin (1813‚Äì1825), she lived in Hamburg all of her life. Born on 26 February 1808, she was educated at home, at two private schools, and at one of Hamburg's H√∂here T√∂chterschule, where she received religious instruction from Johann Wilhelm Rautenberg, who had also influenced Amalie Sieveking. While she seemed not to have turned to piety immediately after encountering Rautenberg, he remained a spiritual adviser and contributed toward her conversion in 1835. He also helped her in opening up a boys' school in St. Georg, Hamburg (1838), the populous suburb of Hamburg where Rautenberg was active, and got her to teach in the Sunday school he had founded in 1825. In 1856, she started her own school: in a rented building, she educated poor children‚Äîwho paid tuition‚Äîin reading, writing, and math, preparing them for further education. She taught English and religion herself. She was especially fond of teaching the youngest children, and wrote a Bible-based alphabet book for the purpose, whose narrative arc spanned from Creation to Eternal life and whose texts included reference to the Ten Commandments, the Apostles' Creed, and the Lord's Prayer; Mein erstes Lesebuch was thus also a catechism. In 1860, Averdieck opened a Christian home for nursing the sick called \\"Bethesda\\" that operated in coordination with the deaconess at Kaiserwerther.

The Paisano Grant was also a key grant in the area, with 11070 acres given to Ramon Garza in 1830. Though many of the families receiving grants settled along the Rio Grande River instead of the isolated area near Jim Wells County, Garza kept livestock on the land, and settled the area near Los Olmos, or present day Falfurrias, Texas. The original grant consisted of 6184 acres in Jim Wells County, 3456 acres in Kleberg County, and 1430 acres in Brooks County. These grants were intended to help colonization of the area by Mexican and Spanish nationals, and strengthen frontier towns along the Texas border. The Paisano Grant succeeded with Garza building a ranch and settling the area. Though Garza was granted the land in 1830 and had livestock on it, he was not given ownership until he petitioned the local City Council in July 1835 to secure the title for El Paisano.

Shin and Choi displayed respect for Kim's film knowledge and perspective. Eventually, Kim shared how he wanted Shin to direct a film and enter it into an international contest. Shin would have an office at Choson Film Studios in Pyongyang. Kim was aware that the internal propaganda slant of his films might not appeal to an international audience and garner spots in international contests, so he allowed Shin to broaden the subject material and select themes that would be more acceptable abroad.

The final and most expensive film that they made under Kim Jong-il was called Pulgasari, which was heavily influenced by the recently popular Godzilla films. Their films included the following: #An Emissary of No Return (Doraoji annun milsa, 1984): Based on a stage play called Bloody Conference written by Kim Il-sung. In the film, Ri Jun, a Korean emissary at The Hague International Peace Conference in 1907 tries to convince the international community to help reverse the Japanese-Korean Protective Treaty of 1905, which left Korea under Japanese leadership. Ri Jun delivers a speech at the conference and when he doesn't win support from the Western powers, he commits hara-kiri in front of the diplomats.

While he is gone, a new governor takes over the province and falls for Chunhyang. When rejected, he imprisons her. Just before she is about to be executed, Mongnyong returns to save her. #Runaway (Talchulgi, 1984): A story set in the 1920s in the Japanese colonial period. Protagonist Song-ryul and his wife (played by Choi Eun-hee) live in poverty. The family moves to the Gando area of Manchuria looking for a better life, but their suffering persists. Song-ryul joins the ranks of the Kim Il-sung group and once he is with the guerrillas, he blows up a Japanese army train. #Salt (Sogum, 1985): A story set in Gando in the 1930s.

It is about a farmers' uprising in medieval Korea. A little girl pricks her finger while sewing, and the blood falls on a little dragon toy made out of rice, causing it to come to life as a monster. It fights for the farmers and smashes the emperor's palace. Nevertheless, his appetite is so big that he starts eating the farmers' tools, so the girl who spawned it decides to sacrifice herself by disguising herself as Pulgasari's food. When the monster accidentally eats the girl, he explodes and dies. Escape To defend themselves should they ever escape North Korea, Choi and Shin decided to sneak in a tape recorder to their conversations with Kim Jong-il so they would have proof that they didn't willingly leave the South. In one conversation recorded on October 19, 1983, Kim spoke openly about his plot to kidnap Shin and Choi to upgrade North Korea's film industry. He told Shin and Choi that it would be best if they spoke to the press saying that they came to North Korea voluntarily. Shin and Choi attended a press conference on April 12, 1984 in Belgrade, Yugoslavia where they said they were in North Korea by their own choosing. After finishing Pulgasari, the two were in talks with Kim about another film when they took a trip to Vienna in 1986. Kim had requested Choi and Shin travel to the Austrian city to find someone that would finance a biographical film about Genghis Khan. On March 12, 1986, the couple checked into the InterContinental Vienna to meet journalist Akira Enoki under the pretense of an interview, and convinced their North Korean bodyguards to leave the room. After telling a hotel employee to let the United States embassy know that they were both seeking asylum, Choi and Shin got into a taxicab with Enoki at 12:30pm and sped away. After being chased by the North Koreans into traffic congestion, the pair got out of the taxi and sprinted into the embassy. The New York Times posted an article on March 22, 1986 announcing that the couple got away from their North Korean caretakers and sought political asylum in the US embassy. Following their escape, Shin lived in the United States for many years working in the film industry before returning home to South Korea. North Korea issued a statement denying the claims that Shin and Choi had been kidnapped and instead maintained that Shin and Choi had voluntarily defected to North Korea and when they left they had embezzled a large amount of North Korean money intended to finance the Genghis Khan film.

Protagonists   Richard Cypher/Rahl  Richard Rahl is introduced to the series as Richard Cypher, the adopted son of George Cypher and the younger stepbrother of Michael Cypher. He learns that his real father is named Darken Rahl (in the television series, Darken Rahl is Richard's brother). He has five known siblings: three half-brothers, one stepbrother, and one half-sister. He grew up as a woods guide in Westland, leading travelers safely through the Hartland forests, and spent most of his life in the woods so that he would know all the plants by name or by sight. He is friends with First Wizard Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander. Over the course of the series, he learns more about his heritage and his gift, facilitating his role as the Seeker of Truth and the master of D'Hara. Throughout the series, he also grows and learns a lot of High D'Haran (the language of ancient D'Hara). He reads the Journal of Kolo to understand and learn this language. Richard is described as having gray eyes (brown in the television series), a piercing raptor-like gaze, dark hair, and a tall, muscular form. In Debt of the Bones, it is revealed that he got his gray eyes from his mother, and it has been quoted by several women in the books that he is the most handsome man they have ever seen. Richard is in love with Kahlan Amnell and sees her as the only reason he lives. Richard is known in many prophecies, but in one prophecy he is mentioned as a death-wielding, but he is a war magician and is the only living war magician in the world, although he cannot be fully specialized at the same time  Kahlan Amnell  Kahlan Amnell is the Mother Confessor and the last living Confessor after Darken Rahl hunted all the others down. A woman of true grace and beauty, she has green eyes (blue in the television series), long brown hair (dark brown or black in the television series), and typically wears a flowing white dress when acting as the Mother Confessor. In the television series, she sometimes wears a green dress, and later a brown and black one, that she uses as traveling clothing. Indicative of her position as the Mother Confessor, her Confessor's power is the strongest among the Confessors. Unlike most Confessors, who typically need one to a few days to restore their power after it has been used, Kahlan recovers far more quickly, requiring only a couple of hours to do so. It is for this reason that she was chosen as the Mother Confessor at an unusually young age. Kahlan is the ongoing love interest and eventual wife of the Seeker, Richard Rahl. She has a kind and generous soul, remarkable for its resolution and devotion to her people, but only the brutal Mord-Sith have less pity for their enemies than does the Mother Confessor. In her fight against the Imperial Order (Stone of Tears), Kahlan declares war against the Order, with no quarter. When she comes across the \\"children\\" (as she calls them), of the Galean Army, it is quoted that she is not much older than the 18-year-old Captain. She is seen entering the order's camp by herself, where she kills the wizard Slagle, and over 100 men. She then leads the Galean men into battle. She fearlessly leads them in the night while painted with white paint, and completely naked, and they are able to deal serious damage the Order's numbers. She is an extremely modest person. When she returns from the initial fight, she leads the captain to believe that she was not really of any assistance in battle. Captain Bradley Ryan caught her in a lie, when one of the soldiers praised her for saving their lives by putting herself between her men, and the enemy troops (nearly getting her killed in the process). Kahlan later becomes Richard's queen and fights with her against the imperial order.  Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander  Zeddicus \\"Zedd\\" Zu'l Zorander is one of the main characters in the series. He is the grandfather of Richard Rahl and thinks of Kahlan as something of a daughter. He is a wizard of the First Order, the most powerful class of wizards. Zedd is the one who sparked Richard's hunger to learn and know as much as he could. Zedd's wizard powers are restricted to the additive side of magic and as a result, he is limited to adding to elements that are already present in the world (i.e. he can change one coin into 10 coins). He cannot negate elements; for example, he cannot make a coin disappear into true nothing; he can only move it to another location thereby making the coin only appear to disappear. He has always been an explorer and as a child often found himself in trouble with the elder wizards by exploring the restricted areas of the Wizards Keep. When traveling incognito, Zedd prefers to use the alias \\"Ruben Rybnik\\". Murdered by Irena, the sorceress of Stroyza (Severed Souls). He lives on as a magical spirit.  Cara  Cara, called Cari as a child before she became a Mord-Sith, is described as a woman of remarkable beauty, with ice-blue eyes and long, blond hair that is kept up in the traditional Dutch braid worn by all Mord-Sith. Within the show, she wears her hair down and it is shorter, her long braid having been cut by her Mord-Sith \\"sisters\\" in an act of betrayal. In the books, she is also described to be tall, and nearly the same height as Kahlan Amnell; she is also nearly the same height as Kahlan in the television series. Her training as a Mord-Sith has provided her with a thin and very muscular form. She was taken to be trained as a Mord-Sith at a very young age, as was customary, and is still haunted by her fears of rats from early childhood training when they used to let the rats in the dungeons nibble on her and other girls' appendages every night. One of Cara's more characteristic functions is her comic relief, through her sharp wit and sense of humor, that manifests itself in quick-witted remarks of sarcasm and wryness. Cara is often quick to state the obvious nature of their predicament and lament the fact that if Richard had listened to her, \\"none of this would ever have happened.\\" As with most Mord-Sith, Cara usually wears her red leather, as she seems to always be expecting trouble. In one of the later books, Cara tries to conceal that she was one of the Mord-Sith that had tortured Richard when he was held captive by Darken Rahl; she is crushed to find he already knew. She often risks her life and almost dies in multiple attempts to save Richard, most notably being tortured in a horrific way involving rats that brings out her unbridled terror in Temple of the Winds. She cares deeply for Richard as his bodyguard, and would die for him, not simply because he is the Lord Rahl, but because he is her friend and she understands and agrees with what he stands for and why he fights. Having earned that respect and trust from Richard, she has become the closest protector to Richard, due to her ability to travel in the sliph after taking the magic of the messenger, and is considered the unofficial leader of the Mord-Sith. Cara, having proven her loyalty and sincere respect not only for Richard, but for Kahlan as well, has come to be considered not so much a friend as a member of the family. She carries great respect for Kahlan, who wears the Agiel of Denna, Richard's former Mord Sith mistress. She is the only Mord-Sith at Richard and Kahlan's wedding, and unreservedly moves to Westland in Faith of the Fallen when Richard gives up hope. Cara is among the most affected by Richard's new rule, in that she has learned to truly love others and to be willing to openly show her affection - after a lot of trial and error by using Richard and Kahlan as practice. At the end of the last book in the series Confessor, Cara finally admits openly that she is in love with the D'Haran army's commanding officer General Benjamin Meiffert and becomes the first Mord-Sith ever to get married. At her wedding, Cara wears white leather in commemoration of their fight, of hope and of new life, of the pride of being a Mord-Sith, and out of respect for customs and a sense of equality to her new husband. After her husband Ben's death (The Third Kingdom) she leaves Richard and Kahlan, but in order to return Richard back to life (Warheart) she comes back to them and sacrifices her own life as she always has wanted. Within the television series, she is portrayed as bisexual and remains unmarried.Note: It was originally reported that Berdine and Raina would appear. The screencaps are actually of Cara and Triana, and a Cara and Dahlia storyline takes place later in the season.Note: Author speaks of how Cara and Dahlia become sexually intimate.  Rahl family   Darken Rahl  Darken Rahl is the primary antagonist in the first book of the series Wizard's First Rule. He is a wizard, the leader of D'Hara and the son of Panis Rahl, a ruthless dark wizard who was killed by wizard of the First Order Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander. He is also revealed to be the father of Richard Rahl, the primary protagonist in the story. (In the television series, he is instead revealed to be Richard Rahl's brother.) After succeeding his father Panis, he became very interested in commanding both additive and subtractive magic, becoming an agent of the Keeper. He is known to rule with an iron fist, and use the Mord- Sith to carry out his torturous commands. He fathers several Rahl children, with all but Richard being \\"ungifted\\". After his father is killed by Zedd, he is driven mad and vows revenge, seeking to align with the Keeper and learn the secrets to opening the boxes of Orden to command its power to do his bidding. He spends many years building an army and overtaking the midlands, crushing all who oppose him. He hunts down all spellcasters and confessors, outlawing magic in his attempt to take total control of all. As his knowledge of subtractive magic grows, so does his yearn for power. Eventually, Richard, after learning the evils of his father, journeys through the perilous lands and made his way to the People's Palace in D'Hara, tricking him into opening the incorrect Box of Orden, thus ending his life. Later, it is discovered that without the Sword of Truth, he was doomed from the start. While Richard accidentally brings his spirit back from the underworld in the second book, Stone of Tears, and Rahl attempts to tear the veil between the underworld and the living world, he is again stopped by Richard and continues to plot against him from the underworld. He is briefly seen in Temple of the Winds where, in the Temple, Richard finds that he has hidden away there and finally banishes him for good.  Jennsen Rahl  Jennsen is the half-sister of Richard Rahl, and has spent her whole life fleeing from Darken Rahl with her mother, knowing that if captured, she would be tortured and killed. She is what ancient texts refer to as a \\"pillar of creation\\" or \\"a hole in the world\\", meaning that Jennsen is completely magically ungifted. Unlike everyone else who has at least a spark of the gift, Jennsen does not have that spark and therefore is not affected by any magic or spell. In addition, she cannot see magic being used and cannot use it herself. Jennsen was first alluded to in the novel Temple of the Winds and was subsequently introduced in the novel The Pillars of Creation. After finding a dead D'Haran soldier, she encounters a man named Sebastian who says that he is the strategist for Emperor Jagang of the Imperial Order. After the murder of her mother, Sebastian takes Jennsen to meet the Emperor Jagang and then through D'Hara to the Old World to help defeat Richard Rahl, whom she believes is seeking to kill her just as her father, Darken Rahl, was. At the end of the story, Jennsen meets up with Richard, who tells her not to blame him for his father's actions. Jennsen learns that the dead D'Haran she encountered at the beginning of the novel was really an Imperial Order soldier who was disguised and then murdered by Sebastian. Furthermore, she learns that Sebastian sent the quad, also dressed as D'Haran soldiers, to kill her mother. In the end, Sebastian kills himself. After realizing that the Imperial Order was the real enemy and that Richard was nothing like her father, Jennsen joins Richard and Kahlan Amnell in their fight against Jagang. She also has a love interest, revealed to be the big D'Haran Tom. In the novel The Law of Nines, Alexander Rahl is believed to be a descendant of Jennsen in the modern world.  Drefan Rahl  Drefan Rahl is Richard's half brother, the son of a prostitute who was concealed from Darken Rahl's gaze so as to spare him his life since he was born as an ungifted son. His mother thought she would fall into Darken Rahl's good favor if she were to bear him a gifted heir. Drefan is said to have exactly the same build as Richard, and almost the exact face as Darken Rahl. He shares the \\"raptor gaze\\" that is common with the Rahl family and he has blue eyes, and was left by his mother with a community of healers called the Raug'Moss or \\"Divine Wind\\" in High D'Haran. In Temple of The Winds, Drefan arrives after Jagang has terrorized the Confessor's Palace in the body of a wizard. Jagang had tortured Cara and left her to die. Drefan healed Cara after the bout and presents himself to Kahlan and Richard as the High Priest of the Raug'Moss. As the plague sweeps through the Midlands in the fourth book, Drefan is used to aid the people the best he can with his knowledge of healing. When the message from the winds comes, Kahlan is forced into marriage with Drefan. Cara, acting as the protector to Kahlan and Richard, leads Kahlan to Richard's room to consummate the marriage between Drefan and Kahlan. Not knowing that Drefan is actually Richard due to the darkness of the hut they are in, Kahlan feels forced to make love to him so that Richard can be allowed to enter the Temple of the Winds and stop the plague that was started by magic stolen from the Temple. Due to Kahlan enjoying the consummation with the man she believes to be Drefan, she is able to fulfill a prophecy saying that she would betray Richard. Richard walks off into the Temple of the Winds and Kahlan is left with Drefan as her husband. Drefan soon claims control of the D'Haran empire and he begins to show his unstable nature. He beats Kahlan, Cara and Berdine and forces everyone to refer to him as \\"Lord Rahl\\" even though he is not the true master of D'Hara due to his being born without the gift. Upon Richard's return to the world of the living, Drefan attempts to kill him so as to maintain his place of power. He is revealed to be the murderer behind several deaths described earlier in the book and he tortures Kahlan and Cara in the room holding the Sliph, until he is stopped by Richard and killed by the Sliph. In the end, it is discovered that Drefan was always an unstable child and he was not truly the High Priest of the Raug'Moss, as he had claimed to be.  Oba Rahl  Oba Rahl is Richard's, Jennsen's, and Drefan's half brother, the son of a woman working in the people's palace of D'Hara during the lifetime of Darken Rahl. He is roughly the same age as Jensen, and was born with absolutely no spark of the gift and magic cannot be directly used against him. With the help of a sorceress, Oba was concealed from his father at birth. His father, Darken Rahl, would hunt down and kill any ungifted children. Due to the influence of the Keeper's voice, Oba came to believe that he was Darken Rahl's rightful heir.  Nathan Rahl  Nathan Rahl is a powerful wizard and an ancestor of Richard Rahl. He is tall, has broad shoulders, and has shoulder length white hair. Despite being nearly a 1000 years old, he is still a handsome man, and is in excellent physical condition due to living at the Palace of the Prophets which has a magical spell that slows down a person's aging while they are within the walls of the complex. Nathan is clever, witty, and sometimes deceitful, but his intentions are always pure. He is also a Prophet, a type of wizard with the power to partially see the future and pinpoint ways that events could occur. Because of this power, Nathan had been kept prisoner in the Palace of the Prophets for nearly a thousand years. This changes when he and the Prelate of the Sisters of the Light fake their deaths and escape, due to Richard destroying the Palace of the Prophets to keep it from falling into the hands of the Imperial Order. Nathan appears in different places, such as the People's Palace in D'Hara, throughout the course of the series, apparently following his own path dictated by the prophecies he envisions. In Phantom, he is appointed as Lord Rahl because Richard has his gift sealed by Six and Violet. Nathan mainly stays at the People's Palace in D'Hara, assisting Richard in his quest, and subsequently makes the Palace his permanent home, living with the rest of the Rahl family and aiding Richard and the others where he can with his magical abilities. He is currently traveling the Old World with Nicci as Richard's ambassadors to D'hara, and searching for a way to fix his gift after Richard removed all prophecy from the world of the living.  Panis Rahl  Panis Rahl appears in Debt of Bones, a prequel to The Sword of Truth series, as a ruthless ruler of D'Hara. Using power and treachery, he turns his attention to seizing control of the Midlands. Panis Rahl throws the might of D'Hara against the Midlands and war rages for many years. As his legions are finally slowed and halted, Panis becomes more ruthless and brutal in his use of magic, killing thousands and wiping out whole villages, towns, and cities. He uses Mord-Sith to capture wizards and sorceresses, and extract everything they know about his enemies' plans. He knows of the boxes of Orden and the Book of Counted Shadows, but is not well enough studied to use them. Instead, he grooms his son, Darken Rahl, to take and open the Boxes of Orden. At the time, the great wizard Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander sides with the Midlands against Rahl and is able to hold Rahl's magic in check. Zedd casts a spell that holds Panis Rahl in his palace in D'Hara, blunting his magic. Enraged by Zedd, Rahl sends a quad after Zedd's wife, Erilyn, and eventually captures Zedd's daughter. Rahl continues to send all kinds of vile people to kill Zedd, even Mord'Sith. Rahl's legions are driven back into D'Hara. An impassable boundary is put up by Zedd between the Midlands and D'Hara to keep the forces of D'Hara at bay. Panis Rahl dies from a blast of Zedd's wizard fire infused with the underworld when he is fifty-seven years old, just as the boundary is going up. His son, Darken Rahl, who was also injured in the blast, succeeds him on the throne of D'Hara. Alric Rahl Little is known about Alric other th–∞n he was the one to find a way to deny the dream walkers access to the minds sworn to him. He also ensured the gift would be passed down to one male Rahl every generation, assuring the continued magical protection of \\"the bond\\".  Mord-Sith  The following characters are Mord-Sith, an elite group of women warriors, who subdue others by capturing their magic, created to protect the Lord Rahl of D'Hara. Berdine Whereas Cara purportedly has sapphire blue eyes, Berdine's are a clear, light blue. She has thicker hair than her Mord-Sith 'sisters' ‚Äî long, wavy, and smoky brown. Although muscular and fit, she is more voluptuous and curvaceous than any of the other Mord-Sith with large breasts. Her face has a square jawline and she banters with Richard in a lively sort of humor. Whereas Cara is sarcastic and dry, Berdine is purposefully provocative in order to fluster Richard with the Mord-Sith's favorite game of testing (Blood of the Fold). She is the only known Mord-Sith to understand High D'Haran, a little known dialect of the language spoken in Old D'Hara and was chosen because she was taught High D'Haran by her father. When Darken Rahl discovered her talent, he sent an envoy to take her and destroy her family, covetous of knowing the highly magical language. She helps Richard translate journals written by a wizard they nicknamed Koloblicin (which means 'wise advisor' in High D'Haran), Kolo for short, that lived nearly 3000 years ago when they found his fragile bones in a crypt. Berdine is revealed to be a lesbian in the third book of the series Blood of the Fold. Beforehand, she consistently worries that Richard will find her repulsive. She has considered being lesbian a devastating secret because Darken Rahl often exploited it in order to amuse himself, having left Berdine and Raina barren from his harsh rapes. Berdine consistently comes onto Richard through overtly sexualized innuendos and innocent questions that set Richard's teeth on edge. When she tells Richard that she and Raina are in love and tries to explain homosexuality to him, he plays the \\"midwestern\\" and incredulous farm boy, which helps illustrate the acceptance of her sexuality that he develops. Berdine goes on to explain to him that she has always taken more of a liking to girls since childhood and saying, \\"Boys didn't interest me that way.\\" Richard, flabbergasted, assures her that they can still be friends on the basis that friends do not need to have everything in common. He asks if she likes peas, she responds affirmatively and Richard says, \\"Well I hate peas, do you still want to be friends?\\" With a watery laugh, Berdine protests that it is not exactly the same situation. After her 'confession' the two become good friends, despite Berdine's flamboyant attitude and Richard's prudish ability to be flustered. Though Cara becomes head of the Mord-Sith, she constantly travels with Richard and Berdine wanes as a major character in the later novels after book six, but she stays behind in the People's Palace of D'Hara to help run the country while Richard travels. She is head of the coalition of Mord-Sith there and acts as a general with far reaching orders to help Richard when he needs enforcement the most. Crushed by Raina's untimely death, she retreats into believing Raina's presence is always there with her. As she reappears in the latter books, she finds companionship once again with another Mord-Sith named Nyda, although her connection with Raina is still intact and profound. Denna Denna is described as having long, auburn hair (blond in the television series), height almost equaling Richard's, and brown eyes with the hardness of steel in them. Denna is assigned to torture Richard by Darken Rahl so that he will be compliant and provide the text from the Book of Counted Shadows, which will allow Rahl to open the Boxes of Orden and unleash the Keeper, thus granting himself immortality. Denna falls in love with Richard, due to his insistence on showing her compassion despite the way she treated him. She eventually asks him to kill her to free both himself from Darken Rahl's clutches and herself from her role as a Mord-Sith. She gives Richard her agiel as a token of her love right before he kills her. After the second tearing of the veil of the underworld, Denna returns as a spirit to save Richard from both his own gift and from the mark of the Keeper placed on him by Darken Rahl. She removes the mark by taking it on herself, meaning that she will suffer for eternity at the hands of the Keeper of the underworld. However, her act of sacrifice on Richard's behalf \\"disgusts\\" the Keeper and he refuses to take her, thus allowing her to join the ranks of the good spirits. When Richard and Kahlan are later separated and seek to know if the other is alright, Denna appears and causes a rift in time to briefly reunite the lovers. After Richard enters the Temple of the Winds, he is visited by many spirits; Denna is one of them. She helps Richard finally decide to leave the temple and return to world of the living. She does this by forcing him to remember the events and emotions of what it was like to be under her control during the events in the first book, Wizard's First Rule. Her last appearance in the series occurs in the book Confessor, when Richard summons her to the Garden of Life to begin his journey into the Underworld as a step to reversing the effects of Chainfire, where she acts as his spirit guide, but is sent away by Richard when they are subdued by the Beast. Raina Along with Berdine, Cara, and Hally, Raina follows Richard to Aydindril in order to protect him. Raina is strong and lean. Although her partner Berdine has more curves than the other Mord-Sith, Raina's muscular lean frame is referred to by Kahlan who (tongue-in-cheek) comments: \\"Well my breasts aren't as large as yours, Berdine. I think Raina's hands would fit mine better.\\" Raina has a sheet of very long dark brown hair, and almond shaped black, piercing eyes that seem to examine someone for every nuance of strength, weakness, and power. Although it is not explicitly stated, her tan skin and dark coloring allude that Raina might be a more exotic blend than the usual Aryan-typed race of the other Mord-Sith native to D'Hara; Multiple Mord-Sith have pale skin, blond hair and blue eyes, as Darken, Drefan and Panis Rahl did. Raina never is as outspoken as either Berdine or Cara. It has been posited that Terry Goodkind knew from the beginning which character he was going to kill. Raina was purported to be a more reserved woman than her two counterparts. Although she is not shy, she is not as pig-headed as the other two. Raina is revealed to be a lesbian in the third book of the series Blood of the Fold when Berdine tells Richard that she and Raina are in love. During Richard's stay in Aydindril, Raina continues to serve as Richard's bodyguard along with Cara and Berdine until her untimely and ultimately inglorious death from the plague. In a heartbreaking turn of events, she dies laughing in Richard's arms, and one of the most notable moments of Richard's rule was that he wept for her, despite her bloody past. Rikka Rikka is described as tall, attractive, with piercing blue eyes and long blond hair. One of twelve Mord-Sith who came to Aydindril at the end of Temple of the Winds, she is surprised that a Lord Rahl is in love. Rikka first appears in Faith of the Fallen when she joins Kahlan at the D'Hara camp during Warren and Verna's wedding. Rikka also appears in Naked Empire, where she helps rescue Zedd from Jagang's camp. She then follows Zedd back to the Wizard's Keep and helps take back the keep. She and Rachel get very close during this time. When Richard comes to The Keep with Cara and Nicci, she stays loyal to him, like Cara, even wanting to leave with them. She ends up staying at the Keep because they use the Sliph to leave and deliver a message to Zedd from Richard. Constance Constance is the Mord-Sith who helps Denna to train Richard in Wizard's First Rule. She is killed by Richard when he leaves the People's Palace. She has brown hair, and has known Denna for some time due to them meeting during the training process of the Mord-Sith. Constance told Denna how she could kill her trainer. Constance betrays Denna to Lord Rahl. Shortly after Richard's release from Darken Rahl, Richard kills Constance with Denna's agiel. Vika Mord-Sith that was captured by Hannis Arc and became his servant. Serves Richard after the death of Hannis Arc of her own free will, having been offered freedom of choice. Her story with Richard continues in the Children of D'hara series. Cassia, Vale and Laurin These three Mord-Sith were captured by Hannis Arc and served him until Richard freed them. After that they became his bodyguards like others.  People from the New World  Adie Adie is an old and powerful sorceress, long-time friend of Chase and is one of Richard and Zedd's most trusted allies. She is described to be a tall fine-looking woman with a strong jaw line. She wears the simple tan robe of a coarse weave denoting her high station as a Sorceress. She has a mix of fine straight black and gray hair of medium length cut in square fashion about her face. Her eyes are completely white having been blinded while being held captive by the Blood of the Fold. She later learns to use her gift to see and with the help of her gift can see more than a sighted person. Her voice is harsh and raspy because the Blood of the Fold poured acid down her throat to keep her from telling her husband, Pell, that she was not the one who named him a Baneling. She speaks in broken language with a strong accent. In the television version, she refers to herself in the third person. She travels to the Old World and studies with the Sisters of the Light. She also travels the Midlands and learns a great deal about her gift of magic from other sorceresses and soon learns of how rare her strength of power is. For a good part of her life, she uses a crutch, because she has to sever her own foot when a Gripper attaches itself to her. Her foot is later restored by Zedd, although he does not grow it quite long enough, so she still walks with a limp. Adie was born in Nicobarese under the shadow and rule of the Blood of the Fold. Most recently, she has lived at the mouth of the pass in King's Port, Westland. Many call her the \\"bone woman\\" because of the extensive collection of bones she has gathered from her travels in both the New and the Old World. Adie claims that she lived in the mouth of the pass because she became tired of people coming to her all the time wanting spells and potions. She wanted to be left alone to study her \\"higher summons\\". The actual reason was to hide from the Keeper. Adie's home in King's Port is destroyed when Zedd attempts to use his magic to study a special bone intricately carved from a dead Skrin. The bones of a Skrin Adie had battled in the past came to life, destroying Adie's home in an attempt to capture her and Zedd and take them into the Underworld.  Duchess Cathryn Lumholtz  A Keltish Duchess who is captured by Tobias Brogan in the Blood of the Fold. She is enchanted and sent on a mission to assassinate Richard. She is killed by a mirswith after handing over Kelton to Richard. She is described as very attractive and fond of luxurious clothing.  Dell \\"Chase\\" Brandstone  Dell Brandstone, commonly referred to as Chase, is the leader of the boundary wardens of Westland and an old friend of Richard's. He is also a long-time friend of George Cypher, Zedd, and Adie. He is a big man with a large frame, clean-shaven, with a head of light brown hair that shows no sign of receding but instead gives way to age by going gray at the sides. Despite his size, he is quick when there is need. When outfitted to travel near the boundary or when expecting conflict, he wears a chainmail shirt and is strapped with enough armaments to supply a small army. Chase lives outside of Hartland with his wife, Emma Brandstone, and his large number of children. He has a hobby of collecting stones of unique shape, color, and texture during his travels, and would tell anyone who would listen where each had come from, and what sort of trouble he had encountered in retrieving it. Chase is rarely flustered or surprised. While he is feared by most people with the exception of children, he treats everyone he meets with respect. After learning that Richard has been appointed as the Seeker of Truth, he dedicates himself to the defense of the Seeker. He continues to fulfill this role, with Richard saving him and his loved ones lives a number of times, until he goes home to Westland to be with his family with his adopted daughter, Rachel.  Rachel  Rachel is a young girl and is introduced in the series as a playmate of Princess Violet, the daughter of Queen Milena of Tamarang. She had short hair, like most non- royalty in the Midlands, which was cut jagged by Princess Violet while she lived in the palace. Rachel originally grew up in an orphanage with many other children, including her brother. It was at the orphanage that Rachel met Brophy. After Rachel's brother was murdered by Demmin Nass, Queen Milena took her to the palace to be the playmate of her daughter. After she had been living in the palace for a time, the wizard Giller entrusted Rachel with the third Box of Orden and instructed her to flee Tamarang, which she did. Rachel was later found by Richard and Kahlan. She is eventually adopted by Chase. In Stone of Tears, Rachel is given the important job of holding onto the Stone of Tears, a powerful magical object sent into the world by the Boxes of Orden. Zedd instructs her to give it to Richard. Zedd also orders Chase to train her to be a fighter. Rachel does not appear again in the series until Naked Empire, the eighth book in the series. After Zedd is taken from the Wizard's Keep and brought to Jagang, Rikka, Chase, and Rachel appear to save Zedd shortly after he activates the sunset spell to destroy the Imperial Order camp. Rachel and Chase return to the Keep afterward, where Zedd offers to let them stay. Though she appears in Chainfire, Rachel has a significantly greater role in Phantom. She is captured by Samuel and taken to Tamarang under Princess Violet where she is returned as her \\"playmate\\". She escapes and takes the Box of Orden which Samuel stole from Tovi and goes with Chase back to the Keep to give Nicci the Box of Orden. In Confessor, Rachel is forced to return to Tamarang by Princess Violet. She alters the pictures Violet has drawn on the caves resulting in Violet dying and Richard Rahl recovering his gift. She is captured by Six and escapes with the aid of Shota (disguised as Rachel's mother) and Gratch. In the book's final chapter, it is revealed that Rachel's ability to alter drawn spells is indicative of her royal blood, and she becomes the Queen of Tamarang.  Shota  Shota is a powerful and feared witchwoman who resides in Agaden Reach. She can take on many different forms, and has the ability to look and sound exactly like any woman, which she uses many times throughout the series to guide or help Richard without him knowing it. She says that her natural form is of an average height attractive brunette that wears a very thin, light, grey dress with many different levels of flaps. She apparently loves Richard and wanted him to stay with her. While the mountains and the swamp around her home are dangerous and full of deadly creatures and objects, her home is actually a grand castle in a beautiful valley that seems to be stuck in the season of spring. For the majority of the series, she keeps Samuel with her in her valley as her servant/follower. Zedd snuck into her valley right before he crossed the boundary into Westland to steal the Sword of Truth from Samuel, who was not named Seeker of Truth by a wizard, therefore he was not a true Seeker, like Richard, and his appearance was horribly altered when the sword was taken away. For this reason, Shota and Zedd do not trust or like each other. Throughout the series, Shota helps Richard and Kahlan through very indirect methods involving her unique form of prophecies. Some of the most notable are giving him the knowledge he needs to obtain the book left for him by the last living War Wizard, the drive to kill Darken Rahl, killing Six, and telling Rachel how to have the Mud People save him from dying in the Underworld.  Princess Violet  Princess Violet is introduced to the series as a little girl with stubby fingers, a plump neck, a big nose, and long, dull, brown hair. She is the daughter of Queen Milena and the heir to the throne of Tamarang. She often wore pink or pale blue satin dresses and jewelry that was too large for her. She enjoyed causing pain and misery to her playmate Rachel while she was in the palace, as well as modeling her mother's fine jewelry. She had a high, squeaky, snorting laugh. After being injured by Richard in Wizard's First Rule, Violet does not appear in the series again until Phantom, where it is revealed that she survived and was later healed by the witch woman Six. She is also revealed to have the gift of using magic in drawings. It is revealed several years after the events in Wizard's First Rule that Six entered Tamarang's royal castle posing as a healer and regrew Violet's tongue and repaired her jaw. Since then, Violet and Six ruled Tamarang together with an iron fist, despite the fact that the Imperial Order had conquered most of the Midlands. Eventually, Six grew exasperated with Violet's ingratitude and ill-temper and seized the throne herself, reappointing Violet to the position of court artist. In the caves in Tamarang, Rachel is lured inside where she finds out the \\"ghosty gobblies\\" are going to kill her thanks to the drawing made by Violet. With a Rachel making a quick alteration to make the drawing of Rachel look like Violet, Violet is killed by those phantoms. Irena The sorceress of Stroyza. Samantha's mother. Was killed by Richard for her crimes. She's responsible for Zedd's death. Samantha Irena's daughter, a teenage girl, resident of Stroyza. Gifted. Potentially very powerful sorceress. Helped Richard to save his friends and her mother from the Third Kingdom. After Richard killed her mother she claimed vengeance. Tried to kill Kahlan and succeeded (almost). After that tried to kill Richard and his friends, but accidentally died doing it.  People from the Old World   Annalina Aldurren  Prelate Annalina \\"Ann\\" Aldurren is a main character in The Sword of Truth series. Ann has been the Prelate of the Sisters of the Light for nearly eight-hundred years and is a sorceress of rare power. She is a short, stout woman who looks to be in her seventies but is actually close to one thousand years old, after living under the spell at the Palace of the Prophets. She often wears plain, black or grey wool dresses, which marks her as the leader of the Sisters of the Light. She and the prophet Nathan Rahl are in love. In the book Blood of the Fold, she fakes her death after an attack of three Sisters of the Dark. Ann is murdered by a few Sisters of the Dark in the presence of Nicci. This occurs in the tomb of Rahl ancestors, where normally the gift would be muffled but when the Sisters linked their gifts, they succeeded in killing Ann and taking Nicci hostage for Jagang.  Jagang  Jagang is the main antagonist in books 3-11. He is a Dreamwalker and has the power to take over others' minds. However, those sworn to the Lord Rahl, Master of D'Hara, are protected from the Dreamwalkers' powers by an ancient enchantment. With this power, Jagang managed to become emperor of the Imperial Order, which controls all of the Old World. His most striking and noticeable feature is his eyes, which contain no pupil or iris; only inky black eyes devoid of any color. He is described to be a short, but very muscular man with a shaved head and a braided beard. He wears a wool vest and multiple piercings including a gold chain from his left nostril to his left ear. Despite Jagang's fearsome appearance and prodigious strength (with many characters in the book believing he could crush a human skull with one hand), is it a mistake for anyone to believe Jagang to be unintelligent. He is in fact very intelligent and well read. Whenever he captures a new city, he has teams of servants who bring him any books that he believes are of note, and has read many, if not all, of the books he has captured. Also, by reading books through the minds of the Sisters of the Light and Sisters of the Dark that he has enslaved, he also knows quite a lot about magic and magic theory, despite being unable to utilize the knowledge himself. He frequently questions his sorceresses about matters of magic that he already has the answers, well before they do, simply to determine if they will lie to him.  Nicci  Nicci is introduced as one of Richard's teachers at the Palace of the Prophets and a Sister of the Dark. She is described as an extremely beautiful and very powerful sorceress with long blond hair and blue eyes, who most people in the Imperial Order come to know as \\"Death's Mistress\\" or Jagang's \\"Slave Queen.\\" Jagang has an ongoing obsession with Nicci. In the television series, she is initially portrayed by dark-haired Jolene Blalock, but her spirit is later resurrected in the body of a blond woman. Nicci grew up in a fairly wealthy home, with a hard working father who owned his own armor producing factory. Her mother was ensconced with the ideas of The Order and fell sway to the teaching of people such as Brother Narev. Nicci was emotionally abused as a young girl by her mother, who made her believe she was never good enough or appreciative of her life under the reign of the Order. Later, at a relatively young age, she was taken to the Palace of the Prophets where she remained for many years. Upon meeting Richard, Nicci's personality changes. To understand this change, she kidnaps Richard, bringing him to the Old World in a futile attempt to make him accept the ways of the Order. By her own volition, she becomes his quasi-wife. As time passes, Richard begins teaching Nicci what life is about and why it is so valuable. Upon seeing the statue Richard carved, named \\"Life\\", she knows that her beliefs and life in the past have been a sham, and she is forever changed. She accepts Richard's philosophy of the sanctity of life and humanistic potential and swears fealty him and his wife, Kahlan. From that moment on, Nicci becomes one of Richard's closest allies and friends. She is the only person on Richard's side, besides Richard himself (and Kahlan to a certain extent), to possess Subtractive magic, and plays a vital role in the conclusion of the series. Nicci is in love with Richard, but has resolved to never act on her feelings due to her respect and loyalty towards Kahlan.  Six  Six is a witchwoman from the Old World, introduced in the tenth book of the series, Phantom. She is one of the few people not affected by the Chainfire spell and her abilities are similar to Shota's. She appears to be even more feared than Shota. She collaborates with Princess Violet, later Queen Violet, to capture Richard Rahl. She concocts an elaborate plan to use the artisan ability introduced in Wizard's First Rule to deprive Richard of his gift. At the end of Confessor, Six is killed by Shota, who took the appearance of her mother. For witchwomen, the seventh daughter is special. Her mother's choice of the name Six for her sixth daughter is meant to be derisive. Six kept the name as a display of power.  Verna Sauventreen  Verna Sauventreen is a main character in the series. She is a Sister of the Light and the only Sister, of the three who set out, to return to the Palace of the Prophets after discovering Richard. She helps him escape and fulfill prophecies and becomes one of his closest friends and advisors. She later becomes Prelate of the Sisters after Ann fakes her death and then becomes in charge of the gifted forces with the D'Haran Army.  Warren  Warren is a wizard and later prophet from the Old World who lives at the Palace of The Prophets in Tanimura. Richard meets Warren not long after coming to the Palace, who is interested in him because he is the Seeker of Truth and \\"The Bringer of Death\\" as described in several prophecies Warren has been studying. Over the duration of Richard's time at the Palace, Warren and Richard became fast friends. After leaving the Palace, Warren, along with the Sisters of Light, helps Richard's fight against the Imperial Order. In Faith of the Fallen, he marries Verna. Near the end of Faith of the Fallen, Warren is killed by Gadi, an assassin from the old world. Creatures Brophy Brophy was born a human but was transformed into a wolf after he was found innocent by the Mother Confessor of the crime he was accused of. When Brophy was a man, he sometimes used his large size to persuade people to do as he wished. He also had a bad temper but it only came out when he was wronged and being cheated. He was a trader in things of dubious nature at the gray edges of law - things of magic, such as artifacts, books and living creatures of magic. His business and wealth allowed him to support various orphanages and see to it they had what they needed to take care of the children. Brophy was wrongly accused by Demmin Nass of the murder of a young boy, who was Rachel's brother. Because of his reputation and being seen around orphanages, no one was surprised when he was accused of the murder of a little boy. Brophy submitted to the Mother Confessor, Kahlan Amnell, to prove his innocence. Kahlan's wizard, Giller, then turned Brophy into a wolf in order to allow him to continue to live his life. The change took away some of the magic of the Confessor, and gave him enough concern for himself to start over with a new life. As a wolf, Brophy is huge with fierce yellow eyes and thick, charcoal-colored fur from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail. He has a mate, the leader of his pack, in the forest near the Rang'Shada Mountains. Together, they have a litter of six pups, who are almost grown. After sensing Kahlan's presence, Brophy leaves his pack to follow Kahlan and is later killed by Nass after trying to protect Kahlan.  Gratch  Gratch is a short- tailed gar who Richard befriends while Richard is traveling to the Palace of the Prophets. Gratch's mother attacked Richard, presumably intending to feed herself and Gratch. Richard kills Gratch's mother in self-defense, but, despite believing that he should, cannot bring himself to kill Gratch. He leaves baby Gratch to fend for himself, not expecting to see the gar again. However, Gratch follows Richard, and, along the way to the Old world, they become friends. Even after arriving and settling in, when Richard leaves the palace, he finds that Gratch is waiting for him. Richard then secretly cares for and feeds the young gar while he continues his training as a wizard. Richard continues this care until Gratch has grown to a respectable age; in the meantime, Richard and Gratch build a stronger friendship. Eventually, fearing for Gratch's life, Richard is forced to send Gratch away. Because Gratch has a very limited vocabulary, he cannot understand why Richard wants him to go. It is through this action that Richard finally realizes why Kahlan sent him away to the palace. Gratch and Richard are later reunited and fight alongside each other until Gratch finds a gar that he loves. Richard discovers that Gratch and the other short-tailed gars were created as a defense against the mriswith, and so is able to see and fight successfully against the mriswith. As a short-tailed gar, Gratch is quite intelligent and is, to a limited extent, able to communicate with Richard and his friends. While people sometimes refer to Gratch as Richard's pet, Richard insists that Gratch is a friend. Gratch appears primarily in Stone of Tears and performs several important tasks for Richard. He delivers a letter to Kahlan, transports Zedd (with the help of a lightness spell) and Rachel, and serves as a military commander for the gars (a status obtained by virtue of his relationship with Richard). Gratch passionately loves both food and wrestling. Samuel Samuel is a smart, hot, horrid creature with a small head, bright yellow eyes, red lips, sharp teeth, a shrill scream, and fetid breath who is obsessed with obtaining the Sword of Truth. Despite his size, Samuel is overwhelmingly strong (stronger than Richard) with big, powerful hands, long, sinewy fingers, and sharp nails. Spaces between his teeth are packed with spongy, gray debris. His heavy breath reeks of rot. Dark patches cover his hairless, waxy head. His feet are as disproportionately large as his hands and arms. His arms are so long that even as he stands erect, he often casually draws lines and circles in the dirt of the road with his fingers. His belly is round and full. There is no hair on him anywhere, and his skin looks like it has not seen sunlight in years. Short dark pants held up with straps is all he wears as he bounds along in his odd, skittering gait. Samuel can speak a basic form of the common language, although his voice is often more of a hissing sound, and his laughter is more of a gurgling sound. Samuel's yellow eyes often change quickly between a taunting grin, greed, fierce hate and wide-eyed fear. They shine like twin lanterns in the dark. From time to time, when left alone, Samuel will occasionally snatch up a stick or rock or any other item and say, \\"Mine! Gimme!\\" to no one in particular, only to soon lose interest and drop his latest find. If given the chance, Samuel will slit the throat of those he dislikes without a second thought. Samuel was the former Seeker of Truth, the direct predecessor of Richard. Samuel was brought to his current abject state by the strength of the Sword of Truth's magical manipulation of his anger. He lives in the Agaden Reach with his mistress, the witchwoman, Shota. He came to her many years before the start of the series, desperate for help, but she could do nothing for him, besides take pity on him. Zedd traveled to the Agaden Reach and took the Sword of Truth from Samuel and Shota and brought it with him to Westland. He was later bewitched by the witchwoman Six, after having the Sword of Truth returned to him when Shota demanded it as payment for helping Richard. He used this to rescue Kahlan from Sisters of the Dark, and was later Confessed and killed, in the final novel.  Scarlet  Scarlet is a powerful red dragon, who is much larger than her depiction on the cover of Wizard's First Rule. Originally, she is the unwilling mount and enforcer of Darken Rahl, who stole and hid her only egg in order to control her. In an effort to find his friends, Richard takes an enormous gamble and seeks her help. A sentient, magical, talking creature, she ambushes Richard, eats his horse and proceeds to 'toy' with him before attempting to eat him as well. Richard saves himself by informing the dragon that he knows the whereabouts of her stolen egg, and will rescue it if she promises to help him find his friends. They agree, though the dragon states Richard's reprieve is only temporary, and that she may later decide to eat him. Richard is released, rescues the egg, and for that she became his friend, and has helped him several times later, both as a ride and with firepower (literally). She gives Richard a magical tooth, which he wears around his neck, and with it he can summon her, but only when he is in great need of her help, she warns. Despite her friendship with Richard, she is still a dangerous predator and thought nothing of devouring the whole village of Mud People if she felt like it. She has the greatest respect for Richard as a Seeker, though frequently teased at each subsequent meeting that she might still eat him. She eventually had her son, Gregory, from the rescued egg and she is mentioned in the concluding book, by the same Gregory, though she was weak and ill because of the world's loss of magic. Her ultimate fate is never revealed.  The Sliph  The Sliph is a being of magic that was created in the great war between the Old World and the New World 3,000 years before the series takes place. This is referred to numerous times throughout the series. The Sliph was a product of this war. The Sliph is housed inside wells located throughout the new and old world. One such well is in the bowels of the Wizard's Keep in Aydindril. The Sliph is a liquid metallic substance that bears the face of a woman. The Sliph is used by wizards and other people who have the gift to travel over great distances. The only price to travel is to have both additive and subtractive magic. If a person without magic is to travel in the Sliph, they will die. In order to travel in the Sliph, the traveler must breathe in the silvery liquid that makes up the Sliph. Breathing in the Sliph is said to be pure rapture and upon exit from the Sliph, many of the travelers find it a true horror to breathe her out and inhale the air. It is never said how long it takes to travel in the Sliph for every time she is asked she replies, \\"I am long enough to travel.\\" The Sliph came to being in the war 3,000 years before Richard Rahl's time and was created by the wizards in the Wizard's Keep. She had been a prostitute that was used by the wizards often. One wizard thought to use her in a different way and created the Sliph by twisting her with his magic. After the Towers of Perdition are created to close off the New and the Old Worlds, the room holding the Sliph was closed and she was put to sleep until a new master (one controlling both additive and subtractive magic) could awaken her. After destroying the Towers of Perdition, Richard finds the door sealing the Sliph's room blasted open and he awakes her during The Blood of The Fold to travel to the Old World. The Sliph holds no true alliances; she allows anyone to travel with her and she does not reveal who her \\"clients\\" are until they are no longer living. Even though she appears neutral, Richard is the Sliph's true master and she therefore serves him.  Lucy  Another creature absolutely identical to the Sliph (first appears in Warheart) but she can travel only between Stroyza and the Wizard's Keep .  Shar  A 'Night Wisp', Shar helps Kahlan cross the Boundary into the Westlands the first time. In her talk with Richard she drops a hint that the Wisps are looking after The secrets of a war wizard's power. She is the first creature who alludes to Kahlan's title of 'Mother Confessor'. She asks for Kahlan to touch her so that she will die feeling loved. Kahlan accedes to the request.

In a racing career which lasted from April 1999 until September 2000 she won two of her ten races. As a two-year-old she was one of the best juvenile fillies of her generation, recording a victory over a strong field in the Cheveley Park Stakes after finishing second in the Sirenia Stakes. She failed to win in the following year but finished second in the Fred Darling Stakes and fourth in both the 1000 Guineas and the Irish 1,000 Guineas. Since her retirement from racing she has had some success as a dam of winners in Japan. Background Seazun is a bay mare with no white markings bred in Ireland by the County Kilkenny-based Lodge Park Stud. She was sired by the Middle Park Stakes winner Zieten out of the mare Sunset Cafe. Zieten was not a notable success as a stallion although he had an excellent first season and has been described as \\"a good source of fast two-year-olds\\". Sunset Cafe, also bred by Lodge Park, was a moderate racehorse who won one minor race at Downpatrick Racecourse in 1993, but her dam, Cafe Au Lait was a half-sister to Hanina, who produced the 1000 Guineas winner Mrs McArdy. In October 1998 the still unnamed yearling filly was sent to the Tattersalls sales and was bought for 62,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent Charlie Gordon-Watson. She entered the green and white colours of Scottish businessman John Breslin and was sent into training with Mick Channon at West Ilsley in Berkshire. Racing career 1999: two-year-old season Seazun began her racing career by finishing sixth in a five furlong maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse on 14 April 1999. Two weeks later the filly started 7/2 joint favourite over five and a half furlongs at Brighton Racecourse. Ridden as on her debut by Richard Quinn she accelerated away from her thirteen rivals in the final furlong and won by two and a half lengths from Blue Velvet. Seazun was off the course for more than four months before returning in the Listed Sirenia Stakes over six furlongs at Kempton Park Racecourse on 8 September. Ridden by Steve Drowne, she finished well to take second place behind Primo Valentino, a colt who went on to win the Middle Park Stakes. Twenty days later, Quinn was back in the saddle when Seazun was one of fourteen fillies to contest the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket. The French-trained Moon Driver (winner of the Prix d'Arenberg) started favourite ahead of Elaflaak (St Hugh's Stakes), Torgau (Cherry Hinton Stakes) and Mall Queen (Prix Yacowlef), with Seazun next in the betting on 10/1. The other runners included Crimplene, Kalindi (Windsor Castle Stakes) and Jemima (Lowther Stakes). Seazun raced down the centre of the wide Newmarket straight as Torgau set the pace, before moving up to challenge approaching the final furlong. She overtook Torgau in the closing stages and won by a head, with a gap of two and a half lengths back to Crimplene in third place. After the race Channon said \\"I was expecting a big run from [Breslin's] filly. She just needed the run last time\\" and added \\"This filly is just quality. She has only had four runs now, we haven't been hard on her\\". 2000: three-year-old season On her three-year-old debut Seazun was partnered by Frankie Dettori when she contested the Nell Gwyn Stakes (a trial race for the 1000 Guineas) over seven furlongs at Newmarket. Before the race Channon admitted that the filly had been slower to reach full fitness than he had hoped. After being hampered two furlongs out, she recovered to take second place, but was no match for Petrushka, who won by four lengths. On 7 May she started at odds of 10/1 in an 18-runner field for the 1000 Guineas and finished fourth behind Lahan, Princess Ellen and Petrushka. In the Irish 1,000 Guineas at the Curragh three weeks later she finished fourth of the fourteen runners behind Crimplene, Amethyst and Storm Dream. In the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot she suffered a broken blood vessel and finished eighth of the nine runners behind Crimplene. After a two-month break, Seazun returned in the Celebration Mile at Goodwood Racecourse in which she was matched against colts and older horses. Before the race she had been bought by the Japanese owner Katsumi Yoshida. Ridden by Craig Williams she finished fourth of the six runners behind Medicean, Observatory and Cape Town. On her final racecourse appearance, the filly finished seventh behind Danceabout in the Sun Chariot Stakes at Newmarket on 30 September, Breeding record Seazun was retired from racing to become a broodmare in Japan. To date (2015) she has produced at least ten foals and five winners: *Hadid, a bay colt, foaled in 2002, sired by Dubai Millennium. Unraced. *B of the Bang, bay colt, 2003, by King's Best.

History  Grimsby is an ancient town which was hugely invested in and enlarged by the railways - notably the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway - in the third quarter of the 19th Century. Specialist sources agree that the date the shed opened is unknown. It first appears on an OS map published in 1888, where it seems to have had six \\"roads\\" (tracks), though all later maps show three tracks under the same general layout. Another source, with local knowledge, states that the shed had six tracks. In 2019 the matter was settled as six roads by a published map and photographs. It had a coaling stage, a turntable and a water tank. In 1898 a water softening plant was installed, the first of its kind on the Great Central Railway. The shed was eclipsed by the opening of Immingham engine shed in 1912. Despite being five miles away, Immingham soon took over providing long-distance locomotives, leaving Grimsby to service (notably rake out ash, top up with coal and water and give the once-over) locomotives which had come into the docks and were getting ready to go out again and to meet the day-to-day needs of the port's large fleet of \\"pilot\\" (shunting and short distance) locomotives. At some point in or after 1912 - again agreed as unknown - Grimsby shed became a sub-shed of Immingham. Grimsby shed building deteriorated over the years. By 1932 its western gable had gone. In the 1950s the coaling stage and shed roof were demolished, as well as the eastern gable. Thereafter locomotives were stabled in the open. Locomotive types particularly associated with the shed were ex-GNR Class K3, ex-GCR Class J63, ex-GNR Class J50 and, latterly, LNER Class J94 until dieselisation around 1957. Lack of clarity surrounds the shed's closure. One source gives 1957, another gives 1961, with demolition by 1962 yet a 1963 ABC Combined Volume still shows both New Holland and Grimsby as subsheds of Immingham. In 1958 a fourth source wrote \\"..there is no motive power depot in the town.\\" By 2015 the shed had been demolished and the site built over as part of the Railway Street Industrial Estate.

On June 25, 1950, The Korean People's Army (KPA) crossed the 38th parallel between North and South Korea. The KPA advanced at incredible speed, capturing Seoul on June 28, 1950. Thus began the three-month North Korean occupation of South Korea. This occupation ended beginning with the UN counter-offensive in Inchon (September 15, 1950 ‚Äì September 19, 1950) - otherwise known as the Inchon Landing. North Korean system in the South The attempt at a North Korean \\"revolution\\" in the South similar to the one in the North from 1945 to 1950 was organized and disciplined for the most part. Although the process did include violence against those considered traitors or enemies of the people, the \\"three-month KPA occupation of Seoul and a large part of South Korea was far from a reign of terror\\". This was reflected in the ways the North Koreans implemented land reform, formed the women's and youth organizations, re-established the people's committees, and structured indoctrination efforts through propaganda. Getting rid of the \\"enemies of the people\\" Once the North Koreans entered Seoul, they initiated mass killings of actual or suspected anti- communists, and the more important political figures were taken to jail. Those specifically targeted were \\"former Japanese collaborators, high ranking members of the Rhee regime, the National Police, and members of right-wing youth groups\\". Executions were at times conducted by hastily organized \\"people's courts\\"; otherwise, those considered resistors to the North Korean regime were shot on the spot. Around 3,000 citizens died due to such organized round-ups. Apart from these executions, the KPA and their associates were \\"careful, at least in the initial occupation, to avoid arbitrary and brutal dispensation of justice.\\" The people's committees The North Koreans re- established people's committees. Upon the end of the Second World War and Korea's liberation from Japan, Koreans had formed local governing bodies, called \\"people's committees,\\" to maintain order in many different localities. When the Americans entered the South on September 8, 1945, they immediately sought to disband the people's committees. The restoration of the people's committees was declared in Kim Il Sung's first radio address after the Korean War broke out. The North Korean occupation's revival of people's committees was seen to symbolize independence from the Americans. In Seoul, the Seoul's People's committee, led mostly by southerners, was organized swiftly. The committee sought to confiscate all Japanese property, and that of the ROK (Republic of Korea) government, Seoul's government officials, and \\"monopoly capitalists.\\" Although many political figures were either killed or put to jail, some avoided this fate by joining Seoul's people's committee, such as O Man-sop, Cho So-ang, and Kim Kyu-sik. Yi Sung-yop, a southerner, was given the position of chairman of the Seoul People's Committee by the KPA (Korean People's Army). Land reform The North Korean system of land reform began in early July. These land reform measures might have further spurred the implementation of land reform in South Korea after the Korean War. Land was taken away from prominent landlords and redistributed to tenants and landless farmers. Families received land based on the number of labor points each family obtained, and the \\"newly redistributed land would be taxed at the rate of about 25 percent of the annual harvest.\\" Southern landowners were able to keep more land than northern landowners ‚Äì they were allowed 20 chongbo (about 50 acres); in the North, nothing over 5 chongbo was permitted. The people's committees were given the authority to execute the land redistribution, under the oversight of North Korean party cadres. The redistribution of land was eventually carried out in every province outside the Pusan perimeter. North Koreans claimed that \\"by the end of August 1950, land reform was accomplished in the provinces of Gyeonggi, North and South Chungcheong, North Jeolla, and in most of South Jeolla.\\" It is also estimated that, by the time the North Korean Army left South Korea, 573,000 jeongbo, or 95%, of the land targeted for redistribution (that was projected in the government land bill) had been fully redistributed. Women and youth Women and youth played a large role politically and socially during the occupation, as in the North. Southern supporters of the North's occupation were mostly from the working class, university and high school students, and females. Equal rights were promised to women, and this was one of the few policies that made a positive impression on the southerners. Many women became involved in the Women's Alliance, which was organized in every district. There was also a focus on the young, as they were seen to be more malleable towards communism. The youth were forced to attend political meetings, whereas the aged were not required to. Also, school was used as an important source for propagandistic efforts towards the youth, and the young Communists (the Youth Alliance) were meticulously and extensively organized through the schools. For example, the Youth Alliance members were assigned to various sections. There was an education section, cultural section, registration section, and accounting section, with the focus on organization and indoctrination. Like the Women's Alliance, the Youth Alliance had district, country, and city headquarters. According to historian Charles Armstrong, a US Air Force survey found that approximately \\"two-thirds of the students actively supported the KPA.\\" Propaganda Propaganda was spread through the use of printed documents, and reeducation meetings. Some of the main goals were to \\"promote aggression toward the United States,\\" turn the South Koreans against their government, and show the citizens the benefits of living under the North Korean system. Radios were confiscated because of the concern that people would listen to international news about the war, then were replaced with domestic radios \\"sealed to the Pyongyang wavelength.\\" These radios were used to repeat newspaper content, and the music played were either Party songs, odes to Stalin, or classical music composed by Soviet composers. However, some people often hid short wave radios in their ceilings or floors to listen to the UN broadcasts, even with the knowledge that they may be killed or jailed for doing so. Printing of existing newspapers were halted and were replaced by new papers from the Party. The articles were written by Party dignitaries and officials, and thus the content tended to be official statements, letters, and speeches . Although the content might have been repetitive and boring, the North Koreans made sure that the press was accessible to the masses, because they viewed this medium to be effective in agitation. Posters, books, mass rallies, pamphlets, theatrical performances, and even comic books were all used for propaganda. Many prominent southern writers such as No Chonmyong, a female poet, joined the communist Writer's League and performed actively in propagandistic activities, such as writing poems or books for the Northern government. Parades and festivals seemed to have been North Korea's favorite use of propaganda. Even on September 15, 1950, the day of the Incheon Landing, the northerners planned a festival, scheduled to be in Seoul, and ironically celebrating \\"communist victory and the reuniting of the country.\\" Notable composers and performers were to participate in this event but ended up fleeing. Community meetings or organizational meetings were also used for indoctrination and reeducation of the South Korean populace. These included reading meetings, in which the people collectively read the newspaper or a Communist text, and self-criticism meetings, which consisted of public confessions of actions or practices against the Communist regime, followed by the audience voting whether or not to accept his or her confession. Also, people were encouraged to accuse others around them who held antagonistic sentiments toward the occupying regime, or those who didn't follow the established laws. Aftermath After the Incheon Landing on September 15, the somewhat organized and disciplined form of administration fell apart. \\"Widespread killing and destruction of property took place\\" as the KPA retreated against the advancing forces. The Communists removed about 20,000 of their prisoners of war on a \\"death march\\" northward and killed many other South Korean political and military prisoners. However, after the re-occupation of Seoul by the UN and South Korean forces, many of those who had joined Committees or supported the Northern regime would again be purged, this time by the South Koreans.

He had a long and varied career, lasting about sixty-five years. He produced at least eight hundred canvases and eight thousand works on paper and board.As of 2016, the Milton Resnick and Pat Passlof Foundation owns 8003 paintings on board and paper, and 402 on canvas, only forty of which are dated before 1980. The rest are in public and private collections‚ÄîGeoffrey Dorfman, Trustee, Milton Resnick and Pat Passlof Foundation. He also wrote poetry on a nearly daily basis for the last thirty years of his life. He was an inveterate reader, riveting speaker and gifted teller of tales, capable of conversing with college audiences in sessions that might last three hours.

His remaining estate is held in trust by the Milton Resnick and Pat Passlof Foundation. Beginning in 2017, the centenary of his birth, the Foundation plans to open his former residence and studio, at 87 Eldridge Street in Manhattan as a public exhibition space to showcase his work, that of his wife Pat Passlof, and other Abstract Expressionist painters.  Childhood  Milton Resnick was born of Jewish parentage in the village of Bratslav, now in the Ukraine. His given name was Rachmiel. Both his parents came from wealthy families: the Resnicks builders and the Mutchniks flour merchants. In the immediate aftermath of the Russian Revolution, Bratslav was repeatedly terrorized by Cossack gangs and the town‚Äîlike so many others‚Äîdecimated. Under duress, Resnick's father abandoned his business and property, and emigrated along with his wife's family to America in 1922. They settled in Brooklyn where Milton Resnick lived for the next ten years. Disobeying his father, the boy left home at seventeen to become an artist., part one, pages 14-15. In order to survive he sold his blood, modeled, and worked at the American Artists School, 131 West 14th Street, as the elevator boy, in exchange for tuition. In 1938 Resnick met Willem de Kooning, likely introduced to him by his sweetheart, Elaine Fried. She married de Kooning in 1943. Resnick was enrolled in the Federal Art Project of the WPA in 1939. He became immersed in the art world after meeting many of the artists at Stewart's cafeteria, where they would congregate after collecting their WPA checks. Drafted into the army in 1940, he served in Iceland, Normandy, Northern Europe and the Rhineland. In 1945 at the age of twenty-eight, Resnick was finally discharged from the armed forces. Willem De Kooning, a faithful friend, had stored some of his art for that period. The rest was lost.  Early Years: Abstract Expressionism  Resnick spent two years painting in Paris (August 1946 ‚Äì 1948). His studio, at 21 Rue de Seine, was fortuitously located for engaging post-war French art. There he befriended the artist Wols, who lived next door. He also met Giacometti, Gruber, as well as dealers Katia Granoff and Pierre Loeb. He observed Artaud, Matisse, Picasso, and Derain at close range, and spent an afternoon with Brancusi in his studio. John Graham visited him there several times.Oral Interview conducted 7/20/88 by Cynthia Nadelman for the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC., (part two, pgs. 14-16, and pg. 26). \\"Out Of the Picture: Milton Resnick and the New York School,\\" by Geoffrey Dorfman, Midmarch Arts Press, 2003, Interview with the artist, page 22. Resnick was one of the founding members of the artist's club, known simply as 'The Club,' in 1949. It became known as the den of what was later to be called the Abstract Expressionists. Other founding members included Franz Kline, Willem de Kooning, Ad Reinhardt, and Jack Tworkov. The Club became famous, a venue for intellectuals and luminaries like Dylan Thomas, Hannah Arendt, John Cage, Joseph Campbell, Buckminster Fuller, Paul Goodman, William Barrett, Edgar Varese and the young Pierre Boulez. In 1951 he participated in the 9th Street Art Exhibition, the first of many organized group exhibitions of Abstract Expressionism in New York City. After a 1949 debut exhibit at Charles Egan Gallery was cancelled, due to a dispute over missing paintings, Resnick did not have a solo show until 1955. As a consequence, his reputation was compromised for several decades. Labeled a second generation Abstract Expressionist, his immersion in the Abstract Expressionist idiom directly after the war remained unacknowledged. Resnick's public reputation increased through the late 1950s and early 1960s. With the new decade, his work, previously characterized by muscular, sometimes chunky interlocking forms that seemed to function as a byproduct of a generalized aggressive attack, began to be replaced with a less fraught, loose and dispersive handling of paint. His paintings simultaneously began to assume a massive size, the largest of which, 'Swan' (1961) reached 25 feet in length. In 1961 he married Pat Passlof, an accomplished painter and former private pupil of de Kooning. For the greater part of their forty-four year long marriage, they lived apart but nearby each other.  Maturity  Night, oil on canvas, 93 x 104 inches, 1977 With the rise of Pop Art and optical painting, not to mention Neo-Dada and Conceptualism, Resnick withdrew somewhat from the art world. Increasingly tending his own garden, he turned inward and began to produce‚Äîin complete disregard and perhaps defiance‚Äîthe dense and rigorous all-over abstractions that would make his reputation.\\"Milton Resnick: Paintings 1945 - 1985,\\" published by Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston, Texas, Essay by Linda L. Cathcart, page 10. An indefatigable worker, these paintings often took months to accomplish before they were realized to his satisfaction. In 1971 he was awarded a large scale exhibition featuring paintings from 1958 to 1970 at the Fort Worth Art Center Museum in Texas. It traveled to the Milwaukee Art Center later that year. In 1985 the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston mounted a retrospective exhibition. He also taught during these years, serving in a visiting capacity at several universities, but never joined any faculty. In 1976 he bought a synagogue on the lower East Side of Manhattan‚Äîan earlier one being turned over to his wife‚Äîand lived and worked in it until his death in 2004.  Later life  In the 1980s along with many canvases, he painted more than one hundred and forty small abstractions on stiff planks of cardboard.As of 1016, one hundred and twenty six of these boards still reside with the Milton Resnick and Pat Passlof Foundation. In 1986 he started to introduce into his pictures proto-human figures often in a cruciform or slingshot gestalt, and nearly interchangeable with his sign for a tree. They remained largely abstract in feeling and tone. No inviting space beckons the viewer nor compromises the quite distinctive agitation of the surface that, along with a preference for mineralized color, characterizes much of Resnick's work for the last forty years of his life. He also painted numerous strange hermetic insignia's. The X, a sign of negation, frequently decomposed into two elbows that often didn't align properly. The attitude towards symmetry and order remained light-heartedly derisive. He always maintained that ideas and narratives were just grist for his mill; nothing more. Content had no significance to him other than to provide an occasion to paint. He didn't generate ideas but made use of them as a subject if it pleased him to.Oral Interview conducted 10/11/88 by Cynthia Nadelman for the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC (part three, pgs, 26, 31). Much of the late work was painted on rag or mold made paper, often with acrylic or gouache. His written poetry became increasingly important to him in the last ten years of his life.

In January 1990 it was secured by a team led by Ralph Molnar. In 1996, in a provisional description, Molnar concluded that it could be referred to the genus Minmi as a Minmi sp. Subsequently, the specimen was further prepared by an acid bath and investigated by a CAT scan. The new information led to the conclusion that the species could be named in a separate genus of ankylosaur. In 2015, Lucy G. Leahey, Ralph E. Molnar, Kenneth Carpenter, Lawrence M. Witmer en Steven W. Salisbury named and described the type species Kunbarrasaurus ieversi. The genus name is derived from Kunbarra - the word for 'shield' in the Mayi language of the local Wunumara people. The specific name ieversi honours Mr Ian Ivers, the property manager who originally found the fossil. The description was limited to the skull. Kunbarrasaurus was one of eighteen dinosaur taxa from 2015 to be described in open access or free-to-read journals. Skull from above and below The holotype, QM F1801, was found in a layer of the Allaru Formation, marine sediments dating from the late Albian, or possibly the early Cenomanian. It consists of an almost complete skeleton with skull, containing the vertebral column up to the middle tail, the left shoulder girdle, the left arm minus the hand, the pelvis, both thighbones and most of the body armour. Both the bones and the armour are largely articulated. In the belly region remains have been found of the animal's last meal. The specimen represents the most complete dinosaur skeleton ever found in Eastern Gondwana (Australia, Antarctica, Madagascar and India) and the most complete ankylosaurian skeleton from the entirety of the Gondwanan continents. Five specimens earlier referred to a Minmi sp. were not referred to Kunbarrasaurus by the 2015 description.  Description  Model, National Dinosaur Museum Kunbarrasaurus was a small armoured dinosaur, that was quadrupedal and had a long tail. In 2015, some distinguishing traits of the skull of Kunbarrasaurus were established. The roof of the skull is almost perfectly flat, apart from a limited convex profile of the postorbital bone and the nasal bone. The edges of the skull top, formed by the prefrontal, supraorbital and postorbital bones, make a right angle with the skull sides. The supraorbital is made up of one bone instead of two or three. The prefrontal is only exposed on the skull roof and does not reach the eye socket. The nasal bone does not reach the snout side and is limited to the snout top and the large, more centrally placed, opening around the nostril. This opening, which is completely located in the nasal bone, is large compared to the maxillary part of the snout and fully accessible from above and the side. The maxilla vertically attains the full height of the skull, reaching to the prefrontal on the skull roof. The hindmost tooth is positioned under the rear edge of the eye socket. The lacrimal bone is directed vertically. The pterygoid bones do not touch each other with their rear ends at the braincase, totally separated by the basisphenoid. The quadrate is vertically oriented. The coronoid process of the lower jaw is strongly protruding. The side of the braincase largely consists of cartilage instead of bone, so that many brain nerves must have had their exits in a single large opening, rather than separate small ones. The inner ear is very large compared with the skull as a whole and differs from that of all other known Dinosauria in the ear vestibule not being separated from the brain cavity, the floor for the cochlea not being made of bone and the vestibule being so large that the semicircular canals are shortened. The skull osteoderms are flat or at most have a low keel. There are no squamosal or quadratojugal horns or bosses on the upper skull corners or the cheeks.  Osteoderms  Kunbarrasaurus had bony protrusions, also known as body armour, in the skin on its head, back, abdomen, legs and along the tail. Several types of armour are known in place in Kunbarrasaurus, including small ossicles, small keeled scutes on the body ordered in parallel longitudinal rows, large scutes without keels on the snout, large keeled scutes on the neck, shoulders, and possibly tail, spike-like scutes on the hips, and a combination of ridged and keeled scutes and triangular plates on the tail. There was one preserved ring of scutes around the neck. A sacral shield is absent. The arrangement of armour is unclear on the tail, although the triangular plates may have run on the sides of the tail, with long scutes forming a row along the top of the tail.  Phylogeny  Kunbarrasaurus was in 2015 placed in the Ankylosauria. The same year Victoria Arbour e.a. had entered QM F1801 and the Minmi holotype as separate operational taxonomic units in their analysis. Whereas Minmi was recovered as a basal member of the Ankylosauridae, QM F1801 had a basal position in Ankylosauria, i.e. was too \\"primitive\\" to be included in either the Ankylosauridae or Nodosauridae.Arbour VM, Currie PJ. 2015. Systematics, phylogeny and palaeobiogeography of the ankylosauriddinosaurs. Journal of Systematic Palaeontology In the 2015 description of Kubarrasaurus on qualitative considerations such a position was indeed deemed likely.  Paleobiology  CT scan of the skull, showing internal components As with other ankylosaurians, Kunbarrasaurus was herbivorous. Unlike most herbivorous dinosaurs, there is direct evidence of the diet of Kunbarrasaurus: gut contents are known from the well-preserved nearly complete holotype specimen, found in the abdominal cavity in front of the left ilium. The gut contents consist of fragments of fibrous or vascular plant tissue, fruiting bodies, spherical seeds, and vesicular tissue (possibly from fern sporangia). The most common remains are the fibrous or vascular fragments, which are typically rather uniform in size at long and have clean cuts at their ends, perpendicular to a given fragment's long axis. Because of the small size of the fragments, they have been interpreted as having been nibbled from plants or chopped in the mouth, evidence of some method of retaining food in the mouth. These small fragments may have come from twigs or stems, but their size is more suggestive of vascular bundles in leaves. The clean cuts and lack of gastroliths suggest that the animal relied on oral processing instead of gastroliths or grit to grind food. The seeds (0.3 mm [0.01 in] across) and fruiting bodies (4.5 mm [0.18 in] across) were apparently swallowed whole. Comparisons with gut contents and scat from other modern herbivores like lizards, emus, and geese indicate that this Kunbarrasaurus individual had a more sophisticated process for cutting up plant material.

The text at the bottom explains the position and costume of the Four Daughters of God The Four Daughters of God are a personification of the virtues of Truth, Righteousness/Justice, Mercy, and Peace in medieval Catholic religious writing. History and development of the motif The most important contributors to the development and circulation of the motif were the twelfth- century monks Hugh of St Victor and Bernard of Clairvaux,Michael Murphy, 'Four Daughters of God', in A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature, ed. by David Lyle Jeffrey (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1992), pp. 290-91 (p. 290). followed by the Meditations on the Life of Christ, which Bernard's text inspired.Klinefelter, R.

The motif is rooted in Psalm 85:10, 'Mercy and Truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other'. The use in Christian thought seems to have been inspired an eleventh-century Jewish Midrash, in which Truth, Justice, Mercy and Peace were the four standards of the Throne of God.Rebecca Moore, ‚ÄúJewish Influence on Christian Biblical Interpretation: Hugh of St. Victor and the Four Daughters of God.‚Äù In Of Scribes and Sages: Studies in Early Jewish Interpretation and Transmission of Scripture vol. 2, ed.

The motif was influential in European thought. In 1274-76, Magnus VI of Norway introduced the first \\"national\\" law-code for Norway, known now as Magnus Lagab√∏tes landslov. Chapter 4.18 of the code, which was key to introducing a new model of procedural law to Norway and was to be read out to judges, makes prominent use of the allegorical four daughters of God, Mercy, Truth, Justice, and Peace. They have the important role there of expressing the idea‚Äîwhich was innovative in the Norwegian legal system at the time‚Äîof equality before the law.J√∏rn √òyrehagen Sunde, 'Daughters of God and Counsellors of the Judges of Men: Changes in the Legal Culture of the Norwegian Realm in the High Middle Ages', in New Approaches to Early Law in Scandinavia, ed. by Stefan Brink and Lisa Collinson, Acta Scandinavica, 3 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2014), pp. 131-83 . The motif changed and developed in later medieval literature, but the usual form was a debate between the daughters (sometimes in the presence of God) > about the wisdom of creating humanity and about the propriety of strict > justice or mercy for the fallen human race. Justice and Truth appear for the > prosecution, representing the old Law, while Mercy speaks for the defense, > and Peace presides over their reconciliation when Mercy prevails.Michael > Murphy, 'Four Daughters of God', in A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in > English Literature, ed. by David Lyle Jeffrey (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, > 1992), pp. 290-91 (p. 290). However, some versions, notably Robert Grosseteste's Chasteu d'amour, the Cursor Mundi, the English Gesta Romanorum, and The Court of Sapience > develop it along the lines of a medieval romance. They place the story in a > feudal setting and give to a great king four daughters, a son, and a > faithless servant. Because of a misdemeanor the servant has been thrown into > prison.

She was one of the first Malay women in Singapore to fight for modern women's rights, according to journalist, Hajah Halizah Mohd Som. Che Zahara is the founder of the first Muslim women's welfare organization in Singapore, the Malay Women's Welfare Association (MWWA). Over the course of thirteen years, she \\"looked after over 300 women and orphans regardless of race or religion.\\" She not only gave people a home, but also taught them religious knowledge and basic economic skills, such as sewing.  Biography  Che Zahara was born into an \\"illustrious family in Singapore.\\" Her father, Noor Mohamed, was an important man and one of the first Malay people to learn English, which he taught his daughter. Her husband, Alal Mohamed Russull, was an advocate of social welfare and justice. After World War II, she and her husband housed orphans and women in need in their own home, which was located on Desker Road in the middle of the \\"red-light district.\\" Che Zahara founded MWWA in October 1947 and used the group to focus on issues surrounding marriage reform. MWWA attracted eighty members, about fifty of which were teachers almost immediately after its founding. In 1948, she wrote four short plays to be performed as a protest against traditional Malay marriage customs, which included the ability of a man to divorce his wife without legal inquiry. In addition, she fought for husbands to pay alimony to divorced wives until she remarried. Che Zahara also supported the Laycock Marriage Bill which created a minimum age for marriage in Singapore. Another initiative that Che Zahara supported was to encourage women to give blood in order to help the Singapore Hospital meet demands for blood transfusions. After the Singapore Council of Women (SCW) was founded in 1952, Che Zahara had a \\"wider network and more resources available to the MWWA.\\" In 1955, she represented Singapore at the World Congress of Mothers which took place in Switzerland. In 1961, Che Zahara, along with the SCW, helped establish the Women's Charter of Singapore. Che Zahara was inducted into the Singapore Women's Hall of Fame in 2014.

Schedule Game summaries Week 6: Michigan On November 9, 1901, undefeated Ohio State, having allowed opponents to score only five points in five prior games, faced an undefeated Michigan team coached by Fielding H. Yost that had not allowed opponents to score in six previous games. The 1901 game was the third meeting in what would become the Michigan‚ÄìOhio State football rivalry, with the two teams having played to a scoreless tie in their previous match in 1900. The Buckeyes lost the 1901 game to the Wolverines by a 21‚Äì0 score in front of 4,000 spectators at Ohio Field. Prior to the game, the head coaches argued over the length of the game, Yost of Michigan insisting on regulation halves of 30 minute and Ohio State's Eckstorm insisting that the first half be limited to 25 minutes. When the umpire threatened Ohio State with a forfeiture, coach Eckstrom agreed to play regulation halves of 30 minutes. The Detroit Free Press noted that Ohio State's players sought to slow the pace of the game. The paper noted: \\"On almost every scrimmage some Ohio man would stretch out on the ground and take his full time. This playing for wind was so apparent that the Michigan players finally burlesqued it. The Ohio men could not stand the gaff, and their doctors and trainer ran more yards than both teams put together.\\" After the game, coach Yost commented on Ohio State's tactic: \\"Their laying down for time took much of the vim out of our team, and rested their tired out players.\\" Ohio Governor George K. Nash attended the game and said afterward: \\"Football is a great game for young men who are physically fit for such a contest, and I enjoyed the game immensely, although I regretted to see our state team lose, but Michigan is entitled to the victory, and I think she was aware she had a game on her hands.\\" References Ohio State Ohio State Buckeyes football seasons Ohio State Buckeyes football ","title":"1901 Ohio State Buckeyes football team"},{"id":"48767469","text":"The 1902 Ohio State Buckeyes football team was an American football team that represented Ohio State University during the 1902 college football season.

Early life  Born and raised in Belfast, where his father Daniel was a machinist and his mother a cleaner, Mornin left school at 15, taking a variety of jobs before joining the Royal Navy. After leaving the navy in 1977 he travelled extensively through France, Austria, Turkey, Nepal and North Africa. He moved to London in 1969. After taking English and economics A-levels he turned down a teachers' training course instead opting for a theatre workshop.  Career  Mornin's first play, Mum and Son, produced at the Riverside Studios, West London, in 1981 (and subsequently at the Lyric Theatre, Belfast, in 1984) opened a rich seam of original drama in the 1980s that included Resting Time (Tring), Kate (the Bush, West London), Short of Mutiny (Theatre Royal Stratford East), and the radio play Scuttling Off (BBC Radio 3). Comrade Ogilvy was staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Barbican in 1984. The Murderers (1985), set in East Belfast at the beginning of the 1970s, directed by Peter Gill at the National Theatre was called by Irving Wardle \\"the work of an able and impassioned writer\\" and for which he won the George Devine award for most promising playwright. This was followed in 1987 by Built on Sand at the Royal Court directed by Lindsay Posner and by Weights and Measures, a black comedy based on the Dennis Nilsen murders, was enthusiastically received by an invited audience at the National Theatre studios in 1987 but considered too dark for a full-scale production. His novel, All Our Fault (Hutchinson, London, 1991), \\"a strong, tragic story of torture and death\\", was set against the backdrop of the Troubles in 1969. In the same year Channel 4 showed Mornin's In the Border Country directed by Thaddeus O'Sullivan and starring Sean Bean, Brendan Gleeson and Juliet Stevenson and for which he was awarded a Banff Award. His second play for the National, At Our Table (1991), was a compelling study of the banality of evil, inspired by Primo Levi and with haunting music by Mornin's close friend Stephen Warbeck. All Our Fault was later adapted for the film Nothing Personal (1995 film) directed by Thaddeus O'Sullivan and for which Mornin was screenwriter and starred Ian Hart, John Lynch and Michael Gambon. Hart won best supporting actor at the 52nd Venice International Film Festival for his part. Mornin also worked as an IT consultant to support himself and his family.  Personal life  Mornin was married to Aine whom he met at the first night of his first play Mum and Son and with whom he had two children.

A part of barracks was burnt down by the Irish Republican Army in spring 1922 before the site was secured by the forces of the Irish Free State in summer 1922.

It is a very sticky shrub covered with many glandular hairs which produce a resin that often obscures the hairs that produce it. The plant is usually found in stony places on ridges and slopes in the Queensland Channel Country. Description Eremophila alatisepala is a rounded, highly branched shrub, sometimes growing to a height of or more with rough branches with many resin glands, making the stems very sticky. The leaves are arranged alternately and are mostly long, wide, linear to narrow lance-shaped often with wavy or blunt serrations on the margins. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on stalks long. There are 5 green or yellowish sepals which are of different sizes and are usually more brightly coloured than the petals. The three upper sepals are longer and wider, curve outwards and have wings which partly cover the sides of the flower stalk. The petals are long and are joined at their bases to form a bell-shaped tube. The tube is cream-coloured but pink or dark orange on the top and the inner surface of the petal lobes and the inside of the tube have darker spots. There are four stamens which are about the same length as or slightly longer than the tube. The fruit is an oval shape, flattened sideways and is about long. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 1979 and the description was published in the Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden. Chinnock derived the specific epithet from the Latin alati-, 'winged' and sepala, 'sepal', referring to the very prominent wings on the upper pedicel and sepals of this species. Stearn lists sepalum as the Latin word for 'sepal'. Distribution and habitat This eremophila is only found in south-west Queensland where it grows in hard stony ground, often with Senna and Triodia species. Conservation status Eremophila alatisepala is a rare species but is currently classified as of \\"least concern\\" under the Queensland Nature Conservation Act 1992. Use in horticulture This eremophila is an attractive shrub with its creamy pink flowers contrasting with the shiny, dark green leaves. It can be propagated from cuttings, although they take a few months to form roots and it can be grafted onto Myoporum. It grows best in full sun in a well-drained soil and is drought tolerant but susceptible to frosts.

It was built from 1870s to 1941. It is also known as Milton Goldfield. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 October 2006.  History  The Norton Goldfield was originally part of the Milton pastoral run that had been taken up by William Henry Walsh, who had named the property for his childhood English home. Walsh was elected a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1859. His opposition to the separation of Queensland from New South Wales ensured that he did not become a member of the first Queensland Parliament. George Williams and Charles Lett discovered gold on the Milton (Norton) Goldfield in 1871. Proclaimed on 12 May 1879 the field comprised 107.6 square kilometres and extended west from the Many Peaks Range to the Boyne River. The field is located approximately south of Calliope and is said to have been named after Albert Norton, a member of the first Calliope Divisional Board. No information appears to be available on the goldfield until 1878 - 1879 when it was reported that there were 60 miners and two three-head stamper batteries in operation on the field. Carmichael who was to be active on the field for many years had set up these batteries. Most of the gold extracted from the Norton field came from reefs although some alluvial gold was won from a gully running through the township of Norton and from Naylor's Gully. Norton goldfield reefs were located to the north and south of the Norton Creek; to the north the principal reefs were the Advance, Who'd-Have-Thought-It, Hickey Claim, Carmichael's Gully, Marodian, Rands and Emu, while to the south the reefs included Frampton's (also known as Martin's), All Nations, Never Never, Little Wonder, Chandlers, Bald Hill, Brigham Young, Hans Big Dyke, New Constitution, Old Welcome and Galena Reefs. Silver was also mined at Norton. The ores at Norton were complex; they contained gold, silver, lead, copper and zinc in varying concentrations, and various methods were explored and tried to maximise gold retrieval, or to retrieve the other minerals. In 1884 the Frampton United Company was formed in an attempt to establish a chlorination plant but the following year Wattle Creek on which the crushing operations depended dried up and crushing operations were halted. In 1886 five reverberatory furnaces were set up at the Frampton United Company lease, to be operated in conjunction with a chlorination plant for gold retrieval. Frampton United Company then erected a barrel chlorination plant and with the 5 reverberatory furnaces achieved a throughput capacity of per week at a cost of . Because the miners did not like the smelting work, Kanaka labour was employed to operate the furnaces. It appears likely the furnaces were used to roast the ores, rather than actually smelt them, as the ore would have had to be friable to be chlorinated successfully. The ore was first crushed in a \\"dry crusher\\" and a 10-head battery, before roasting. This chlorination works was closed down in 1891, possibly because the nature of the ore changed and the components absorbed too much chlorine. No further reference is made to roasting ore. In 1888 a 10-head stamper and a \\"dry crusher\\" were installed but these proved a failure. In 1889 the Advance Company went down and erected roasting and chlorination plant but following an unsuccessful attempt to treat of ore this plant was abandoned in 1890. The continued failure was probably due to a high amount of calcite in the ore. The Conran Gold Mining Company took over from Frampton United Company in 1891 and the chlorination works were suddenly shut down possibly because of a change in the composition of the ore. By 1893 only minimal work was being undertaken including surface collection. In 1895 Carmichael again tried chlorination but failed once again. Still further attempts were made to make the field payable and in 1899 Carmichael erected a water-jacket blast furnace but the results were not satisfactory probably because a qualified metallurgist was not employed to manage the blast furnace. Although an application was made for a further 2 leases no work carried out until 1902 following the opening of the road to Bororen that provided direct access to the North Coast Railway. In 1903 Marodian Gold Mining Company acquired a lease of but by 1904 had ceased operation. In 1906 Carmichael erected a water-jacket blast furnace to drive off lead and zinc which would leave a copper matte containing the gold and silver. Between 1906 and 1918 several small groups worked the mines with the ore being sent to Port Kembla for treatment. It was during this period that German army engineer Johan Gundolf erected a water- driven crushing mill (known as an arrastra) and a water-race along the banks of Norton Creek. In 1918 Frampton Mine, one of the more consistent operations at Norton employed four men to work the mine and although a 10-head stamper battery had been acquired this was not set up until 1923. In 1924 tramlines were laid down connecting the mine and the battery. In 1927 it was reported that a good crushing plant was available but the owners were unable to proceed with crushing. In 1928 a crushing of of ore was sent to Port Kembla for treatment. The return from this was of gold and of silver. The last Norton Goldfield returns appear to have been in 1941, when the Frampton mine was re- opened by TH Smith and the ore sent to Chillagoe for treatment. While official reports of the returns are patchy available figures show that of gold were mined on the Norton Goldfield during the period 1879 -1941.  Description  Surviving chimney on the Norton Goldfield, 2009 The Norton Goldfield is accessed via Norton Road which exits the village of Nargoorin to the east. Travel along this roadway in a northeast direction for approximately . The gold roasting furnace site consists of four parallel brick plinths with collapsed brick arched roofs, interpreted as being roasting furnace bases. The plinths are separated by approximately spaces between them, one of which at least is paved (the others are largely covered with soils and rubble). The furnaces fed in pairs into two chimneys via brick and stone flues, interconnected with a cross flue between each pair. The furnace bases have flat floors that appear to have been wide internally, with arched roofs about high, and the floors step up towards the flue-end by one course of brick every . There are vaulted tunnels/boxes under two of the furnaces about from the end opposite the flues, but there are no apparent fireboxes. The furnace bricks are not firebricks, and there is no vitrification or slag deposit in them, suggesting they were used for roasting rather than smelting. One chimney remains upslope of the furnaces, to height. Downslope of the furnaces is a brick paved area, with water tanks and machinery footings stepping down the slope from it. Close to the creek are footings and base-logs that may have been the footings for a water pump. The remains of another furnace is located some to the east. This furnace is approximately long, with a rubble plume extending another , possibly indicating a fallen chimney and the extension of the kiln itself. The four conjoined furnaces, together with the separated one, are interpreted as being the five \\"reverberatory\\" furnaces built in 1886. On the banks of Norton Creek are the remains of a long water-race that is said to have been associated with the arrasta. The water-race appears to have been lined along its sides with bricks as remains of these can be seen in some sections. The 10-head stamper battery with steel frame is located about from the creek. A concrete engine footing is located adjacent to the battery to the southeast. The posts for a partly-collapsed gantry, level with the top of the battery, lead south , then in a series of separate low embankments back to a mine adit to the south. This appears to be the support embankment for a tramway linking the mine and is not demonstrated. Some small brick rubble piles around the area may indicate other buildings. The area is also dotted with more recent core-drilling pads, is quite eroded and an upgrade of the access road to the adjacent opencut mine tends to confuse the interpretation of the historical remains. A concrete-lined brick tank is embedded deep into the hillside, and may be a header tank for battery water.  Heritage listing  Norton Goldfield was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 October 2006 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Norton Goldfield is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's mining and settlement patterns from the late 1870s through to the 1940s; its success, failures and eventual abandonment closely linked to the difficulties encountered in treating the ore. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Norton gold roasting works is an unusual aspect of gold mining, not represented at any other known sites in southern and central Queensland. The operational association between the battery and the mine is uncommon and rare. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The technological evidence of the attempts to treat difficult ore bodies has the potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's mining history and metallurgy.

She advocates using itjihad (informed independent thought). The author has criticized some English translations of the Qur'an, and she argued that the document may be explored in any language.

It was built from 1873 to 1926. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Langmorn Homestead is the residence and associated outbuildings of a pastoral property located in the Port Curtis Hinterland and was established in 1869 by Thomas Creed and his family. The region in which Langmorn is located was first explored by Charles and William Archer in 1853. Two years later, William Landsborough also explored the region, taking up the run of Raglan in the same year. It was managed by Landsborough‚Äôs sons, James and John, with James occupying the property with his family. By 1862, he had acquired sole ownership of Raglan which then comprised 200 square miles on which sheep were run. By 1865, Raglan had been sold and passed wholly into the ownership of the Bank of New South Wales by 1868. In this year the Crown Land Alienation Act was passed which enabled the Government to resume half the area of large runs to permit closer settlement. The Bank consolidated the property in 1869, selling the south western portion to brothers Thomas and George Creed. They named the new property Langmorn and operated it as a cattle run. From accounts in Thomas Creed's diaries, there appears to have been a continuing relationship between the two properties, with landmarks on Raglan also being used by Langmorn as meeting and resting points. Thomas Creed first arrived in Australia from England in 1853. He unsuccessfully prospected for gold at Ballarat, later entering a partnership in the farming industry. In 1857 he returned to England where he married Edith Allen. The new Mrs Creed's parents had left her a property in Jamaica which the Creeds took over in 1859. However, in 1868 they returned to England and then sailed for Brisbane with their two small sons, arriving in Moreton Bay on 23 January 1869. When George Creed arrived by a later boat, the brothers travelled north in October to inspect Langmorn Station before purchase. On 14 December 1869, the family moved to Langmorn. At first the Creeds lived in an existing house, presumably built for Raglan, but in May 1873 a homestead was constructed for them by a Mr Pershouse. In 1877 this was substantially enlarged by William Semfel with assistance from station workers. Timber for the construction and additions to the homestead was cut on the property, although pine planks were ordered for the later work from the Calliope Sawmill. The area of Langmorn's land was substantially reduced during the late 19th century due to resumptions in relation to the various Land Acts of the period. In 1905 the residence was enlarged by building a new timber structure adjacent to the old; the space where the verandahs of the two abutted becoming an open living area. The addition had four rooms and provided a new formal entrance for the house. This effectively reorientated the residence because the new entrance faced north, while the front of the first house looked east. In 1910 Thomas and George Creed secured ownership of the homestead block at auction. Thomas Creed died at Langmorn in 1911, at the age of 85. Four of his five sons remained on the property, dividing it into four parts, each with its own homestead. The additional three homesteads being named Prior Park, Cecilwood and Cleveden. Further work continued on the Langmorn homestead building until 1917, when the verandahs were partially enclosed. A large concrete stable building was constructed in 1926. The current owners, members of the Creed family, have owned the property since 1998. The buildings are very intact and new sheds on the site have been constructed using bush pole frames and corrugated iron roofs in a similar manner to the original buildings. New work has been dated, continuing a family tradition begun in 1873.  Description  Graveyard, 2009 The Langmorn homestead complex is sited on a hill and can be seen from a distance because the specimen trees around the homestead and along the drive serve as visual markers. The complex comprises the main house, cottage, a number of outbuildings, a family graveyard and mature plantings. The residence consists of a rectangular 1870s building looking north east with a 1900s extension adjoining it on the north west. This later structure provides a formal front entrance to the house and is approached by a circular drive around a lawn with trees and a rockery fountain. It is constructed of timber with exposed studs. The gambrel roof is clad with corrugated iron. The verandah to the front and north eastern side has balustrading formed of cast iron panels, that on the south west has been built in to create a bedroom, bathroom and toilet. The central entrance opens on to a hall from which bedrooms open out on either side. To the rear there is a third bedroom and a library. A large open area is formed between the two buildings which comprise the residence where their roofs touch. This building has a hipped roof clad originally with shingles which can still be seen under the roofing iron. The core structure of the earlier building is timber with exposed studs. It comprises three main rooms and has French lights opening onto a verandah which surrounds it. This is now enclosed and has small rooms to what was formerly the rear. The section along the former is built in with fibrous cement panels in the lower section with windows in metal frames above. Kitchen cabinets have been built into the south east corner of the verandah. The post at this corner is carved with the inscription \\"TC GC 1873\\". That on the northern corner is similarly carved with \\"T Creed 1877\\". Behind the main building is a courtyard area which has a small slab building, formerly a staff bathroom, now used as a toilet for visitors. There is a weatherboard clad cottage to the south of the main building. It is set on low stumps, has a gabled roof with new metal cladding and has verandahs all round, sections at the front having been built in. It has 12 pane windows and the interior walls are to partition height only. It is currently used as a souvenir shop. There is an L shaped concrete stable building behind the house which is marked with the date \\"1926.\\" It has a hipped, metal clad roof and large timber doors. The walls are rough cast and have metal framed multiple-panel windows set within moulded concrete surrounds. Situated to the west of the stables is a small building constructed of timber slabs on a pole frame with a gabled roof. This is believed to be the oldest building on the site. To the south east of the stables and behind a large modern vehicle shed is a small timber building which the family believe to have been the original homestead. This has a frame clad with weatherboards and a gabled roof extended out to form a verandah supported on timber posts. The interior is divided into two by a partition extending only to wall height. Situated on a rise to the south of the homestead is the family graveyard. It the highest point in the complex and commands a fine view across the valley. The earliest burial is that of Edith Augusta Creed who died on 21 May 1873 aged 1 year and 8 months. It also contains the burials of several generations of the Creed family including those of Thomas (1826-1911) and Edith Creed (1838-1881) Creed. The memorials are inscribed slabs and the area is encircled by a timber fence with a pair of metal gates.  Heritage listing  Langmorn Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Langmorn homestead illustrates the pattern of early European exploration and settlement of Queensland where the development of pastoral properties preceded agriculture and the establishment of towns. As an early homestead in central Queensland which has remained in continuous use, it has important associations with the development of the pastoral industry in Queensland. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Because Langmorn has continued in the ownership of one family and is well documented, the homestead complex provides an uncommonly good and intact record of an evolving pastoral property established in the mid 19th century. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. Due to its age and intact nature, Langmorn has the potential to yield information on the way in which such properties were run and evidence for the building techniques used over several generations, thus contributing to an understanding of Queensland's history. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is a demonstrates the principal characteristics of a 19th-century homestead well, including the residential buildings, associated outbuildings, graves, fences and mature trees. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The homestead complex contains structures which are well designed and made examples of traditional buildings which are pleasing in form, materials and detail and mature trees which contribute visually to the setting and provide a landmark in the area. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Langmorn homestead has a special association with the life and work of the Creed family, who, as early pastoralists contributed to the development of the area.

The boundaries were formalised in January 2000 for the long established name for the area. There was a railway siding at Hart on the Gladstone railway line. The major industry in the area is cereal crop growing. Name The Hundred of Hart (part of the cadastral system in South Australia) was proclaimed in 1864 and named after Captain John Hart, a member of the colony's parliament and the Treasurer at the time (and later Premier). Geography The Hundred of Hart lies on the plains and western slope of the Yackamoorundie Range (known as the Middle Range at the time the Hundred was proclaimed). The eastern boundary of the Hundred is about along the crest of the range, mostly above altitude, running roughly north‚Äìsouth. The southern boundary is part of the northern boundary of the Hundred of Blyth. The northern and western boundaries were arbitrary straight lines running true west and true south. The northern boundary is about long. The western boundary is now mostly followed by a road, which includes the main street of Brinkworth and is below altitude. The current Bounded Locality of Hart occupies almost the southern half of the Hundred. There was a Government Town named Anama surveyed in 1865, which was not fully developed, and officially ceased to exist in 1924. It was named for a local property owned by George Charles Hawker, near what is now the boundary of Hart and Rochester, both in the Hundred of Hart. The railway station may have been named for this Government Town on some maps, rather than for the Hundred district it was in. School and church Hart previously had a school which operated from 1895 to 1922. One of the notable former pupils was Sir Lyell McEwin, who had been born in the area.Judith Raftery, 'McEwin, Sir Alexander Lyell (1897‚Äì1988)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mcewin-sir-alexander-lyell-15104/text26305, published first in hardcopy 2012, accessed online 9 December 2015. The residents of the district had been petitioning the government to provide a school, however they eventually erected a stone building to serve as a community hall, for uses including a public school and religious worship. The Annie McEwin Snow Presbyterian Memorial Church opened in 1923. It was named in honour of Alexander Lyell McEwin Snr's daughter who had died after a brief illness, aged only 30. Construction was funded by him and her father-in-law. It stands adjacent to the Hart hall which had also been the school. It closed in 1976 and is now a private residence.https://www.flickr.com/photos/82134796@N03/22514905311 Hart Field Site Hart Field Site is a agronomic field trial site where broadacre crops and cropping techniques are tested. The site is owned by the Hart Field-Site Group, established as a committee in 1982.

It was built from to 1913. It is also known as Raglan Station. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Raglan Station, located just north of Larcom (earlier Larcombe) Vale Creek in the Port Curtis hinterland, was established in 1857 by James Landsborough. The present main residence at Raglan Homestead was erected in 1913, but there are other earlier structures within the complex, including a slab hut that may date to the establishment of the station, and a timber cottage. The area was explored by Charles and William Archer in 1853 and in 1856 by William Landsborough (who in 1861-1862 was to lead one of the official relief expeditions in search of the missing explorers Burke and Wills). It was incorporated within the Port Curtis Pastoral District, proclaimed in January 1854, which included the County of Raglan, named in honour of Lord Raglan, a British hero of the Crimean War (1853-1856). Frontier violence ensued as squatters moved into the district and in 1855 five persons on Mount Larcom Station were killed by Aborigines. The brothers James and John Landsborough, originally from Stevenston in Scotland, had taken up sheep-raising in the New England district of New South Wales in the 1840s, but in the 1850s decided to search for better pastures to the north. Between 1854 and 1858 James and John in partnership, and their younger brother William in partnership with others, took up a number of Wide Bay- Burnett pastoral leases. From the late 1850s they began transferring their interests to the Port Curtis district, commencing with James Landsborough overlanding sheep onto Raglan run in 1857. The run was situated on Raglan Creek midway between Gladstone and Rockhampton, in the County of Deas Thompson. James had just reached the station and was constructing the first slab hut on the Raglan Homestead site, above the Larcom Vale Creek crossing, when John Macartney visited him on 30 December 1857. The first Raglan wool clip was ready by February 1859, when the Archer's boat the Jenny Lind sailed up Raglan Creek to move the cargo to Gladstone. A mail service between Port Curtis (Gladstone) and Rockhampton via Raglan Station commenced in 1859. Coaches subsequently used this route, and a change station operated at Raglan Head Station until Parson's Inn was opened near Black's Crossing on Raglan Creek . John and James Landsborough gained the official lease of the Raglan run in January 1860. About this time James, who had married Georgiana Sothers in Maitland in 1849 and had a young family, erected a new dwelling on Raglan: an exposed-stud timber building of two rooms with a wide surrounding verandah and a detached kitchen at the south-west corner. In 1862 James acquired sole interest in Raglan and Larcom Vale runs and by 1863 the Raglan Station he had developed comprised at least seven runs - Raglan, Larcom Vale, San Jose, Stevenston, Trafalgar, Meringo and Lodi - approximately in total, bounded to the north by the Bajool Scrub and Gracemere station, to the south by the Bracewell Scrub and Mount Larcom station, to the west by the Dee Range, and to the east by coastal mudflats. He continued to run sheep at Raglan, cared for mainly by recent Chinese immigrants. However, in 1865 he relinquished his interest in Raglan to take up Sonoma station near Bowen Downs (held by William Landsborough and others) in the Kennedy pastoral district. The leases to Larcom Vale, San Jose, No.2 Stevenston, and Trafalgar were transferred in mid-1865 to AH Richardson, General Manager of the Australian Joint Stock Bank. By February 1867 John Ward was occupying Raglan station, raising cattle. By March 1868, White and Ronald held the leases to Raglan (30 square miles) and Marengo (25 square miles) in the Port Curtis Pastoral District, and AH Richardson still held Larcom Vale, Trafalgar, and San Jose. The telegraph line between Rockhampton and Port Curtis Island in Keppel Bay was constructed via Raglan Station in 1867 and in the same year the Raglan and Langmorn goldfields were proclaimed, resulting in a small, brief \\"rush\\" on the station. A few shops and hotels were constructed to service these goldfields, but little evidence of these survives. In 1868 the Raglan leases passed to the Bank of New South Wales, which in 1869 consolidated the property under the provisions of the Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1868 and sold the south-western portion to brothers Thomas and George Creed, who named their property Langmorn, which they operated as a cattle station. From accounts in Thomas Creed's diaries, there appears to have been a continuing relationship between the two properties, with landmarks on Raglan also being used by Langmorn occupants as meeting and resting points. At the time of the 1 September 1871 Queensland census, there were four houses on Raglan Station accommodating 20 persons (16 males and 4 females), and at Langmorn there were 2 houses sheltering 10 persons (7 males and 3 females). Part of the resumed portion of Raglan was thrown open to selection as homestead areas in 1876. Between and Raglan was occupied as a cattle run by David Wilson, initially in partnership with Richard Elliot Palmer, but obtaining sole interest early in 1873. His DW2 remains a station brand. He applied for the Raglan Head Station block, located on the north side of Larcom Vale Creek, as a pre-emptive selection of , but did not obtain title and in June 1874 the freehold was purchased by Archibald Menzies of Melbourne, who also acquired the Raglan leasehold of about . At this time improvements at Raglan Homestead were valued at over and comprised: a dwelling house () and garden, store, kitchen, bachelors' quarters, men's hut (possibly the original 1857 hut), fowl house, sheep classing yard, wool shed, other stockyards and extensive fencing. Between late 1878 and mid-1885 Raglan Station was managed by John A Menzies, who erected a small weatherboard school at Raglan Homestead, where his children were tutored. In mid-1885 the Raglan lease and the head station freehold were transferred to Thomas McKellar of Melbourne whose agent, JA McKellar, managed the property and applied in September 1885 to bring Raglan under the provisions of the Crown Lands Act 1884. For this purpose the consolidated Raglan Station was assessed as comprising available for subdivision, with the land capable of running 37 head of cattle to the square mile. In June 1887, of the run (much of this marine plains and scrub lands) was resumed for closer settlement, although this was not opened for selection until 1899. The remainder was leased to Thomas McKellar. About 1886 McKellar added a two-roomed cottage wing to the house. By December 1892 Thomas McKellar had returned permanently to Scotland and in March 1893 transferred his interest in Raglan, including the head station freehold, to his brother Ernest Edward McKellar, who initially resided on the property. By April 1898 John N Menzies, whose father had managed Raglan station from 1878 to 1885, had returned to Raglan as manager, a position he held for eleven years. Following the devastating drought of 1902, EE McKellar was left with a run reduced to five-sixths of its original area and in 1909 made the decision to dispose of Raglan Station, selling to John Murray Macdonald on 18 February 1910 JM Macdonald (only he chose this spelling of the family name McDonald) had sold his Ben Ean vineyard, cellar and distillery in New South Wales to Lindeman's Wines Ltd with a four-year management contract to early 1912, allowing him \\"cash in hand\\" to travel north in search of a cattle property. On purchase of Raglan he still had two years of his contract to fulfil with Lindemans, so an agreement was made with Frederick William Tyrrell, who acted as managing partner until John and his wife Harriet (Hettie), arrived at Raglan in May 1912. Title to the Raglan Homestead block was transferred to JM Macdonald in June 1912. In 1913 a new residence was constructed at Raglan Homestead for the Macdonalds, just south of the cottage wing and house, overlooking Larcom Vale Creek. The substantial timber residence was designed by Fredrick Eckersley Boddington, an architect based in Rockhampton from 1911 to 1915, and was constructed by contractors Taylor and McKenzie. A sawmill was set up on the creek below the house where all the hardwood timber was milled. The house was built on high timber stumps and comprised 42 squares, over half of which were taken up by a deep encircling verandah. The front (southern) elevation had a centrally-positioned divided stair leading to the verandah. Both the verandah and the stair had a simple slatted timber balustrade with some cross-braced timber panels for a decorative effect. The hipped roof, which extended in bungalow fashion over the verandahs, had gablets to the eastern and western ends and was clad with corrugated galvanised iron. The internal layout of the 1913 house incorporated two large living spaces in the centre: a front (southern-facing) dining room and the only room in the house to contain a fireplace; and behind this, on the northern side of the building, a tropical lounge , separated from the rear verandah by lattice timber panels and walk-through openings. On the western side of this room, steps led to the sub-floor. The eastern side of the building contained a main bedroom at the front, small office, and another bedroom at the rear; the western side was the service wing, with maid's bedroom at the front (separated from the dining room by a hall leading to the front verandah), pantry and kitchen. Ceilings throughout were in height, to encourage air circulation. With the exception of the office and the pantry, all the other rooms opened via French doors to the verandahs. Interior partitions were of vertically-jointed tongue-in-groove timber boards. During John and Harriet Macdonald's ownership of Raglan, John's nephew Hector McDonald worked on Raglan between 1920 and 1924. Three other overseers were employed: Eric White, who came from Ben Ean in New South Wales; Charlie Mayne who was at Raglan from the 1920s to 1931; and Archie Stewart who stayed for over 32 years from October 1931. The house was demolished about 1930. After Hettie's death in 1938 John Macdonald, who had no children, relied increasingly on Archie Stewart and his wife Jane. On his death on 26 December 1957 at the age of 94, John Macdonald left a portion of Raglan Station to the Stewarts but the bulk of his estate, including Raglan Homestead, passed as the John and Hettie Macdonald Trust to the Presbyterian Church of New South Wales, to be used to build homes for the aged. The trust was divided when the Uniting Church was formed in Australia in the 1970s, and is now known as the Macdonald Homes for the Presbyterian Church and McDonald Homes for the Uniting Church, with over 70 houses built in Sydney. In February 1961 the Presbyterian Church sold Raglan Station to John's nephew and executor, Hector McDonald and his wife Betty and eldest son Ian, who had completed a degree at the Gatton Agricultural College in 1958. The family took up residence there in April 1962. In 1969 Hector and Betty retired to a property near Warwick, leaving Ian and his family on Raglan. In the 1970s Ian McDonald made a number of changes at the homestead, including demolition of the school house and relocation of part of the old kitchen to the north-east corner of the cattle yards in 1970, and relocation of the slab hut (possibly dating to 1857) from in front of the 1913 house to beside the horse yard, to function as a saddle shed. In 1983 Raglan Station passed out of the McDonald family and was acquired by the Olive family in 1986. The roof and verandah of the main residence were reconstructed following a severe storm on 7 November 2000.  Description  Slab hut, 2009 Raglan Homestead is located to the north-east of Raglan Creek and just north of Larcom Vale Creek, approximately halfway between Rockhampton and Gladstone on the old coach road, which is now by-passed by the Bruce Highway. The complex is located six kilometres from the highway in an easterly direction. Early structures within the complex include a slab hut (possibly dating to 1857), a timber cottage, a 1913 residence, sheds and stables. The main residence (1913) is a high set, timber-framed house (exposed stud) lined with vertically-jointed tongue-in-groove timber boards. French doors with breezeways and timber-framed sash windows are located along each elevation and open to the verandah which surrounds the building on all sides and offers sweeping views of the surrounding country. Internally, the homestead retains much of its original vertically-jointed timber partition walls and timber ceilings. A low-set, timber-framed cottage () clad with weatherboards, with a stepped verandah and a hipped roof clad with corrugated iron, is located just north of the main house. There are back-to-back fireplaces with timber surrounds in the wall between the two rooms, but the chimney is no longer extant. The slab hut (possibly dating to 1857) is a single-storeyed, timber- framed structure with a gable roof clad with corrugated iron, set on the ground a short distance from the main house. The building has a timber floor and walls constructed of vertical slabs, the tops of which are set in morticed top bearers. The upper sections of the side elevations are clad with corrugated iron. A stepped verandah with a skillion roof is located to one side of the hut. Two nine-pane windows are located in the front elevation. The entrance to the hut, a panelled timber door, is located in this elevation. A large, two-storey volume shed constructed with bush timbers and clad with corrugated iron is located near the slab hut. Also located near the slab hut is a stables, which is timber-framed and clad with corrugated iron, with large double timber doors located along one elevation. Attached to the stables is a timber-framed shed and set of timber yards. Other later sheds and holding yards have been constructed on the homestead site. These are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. A large tamarind tree remains, originally central to the front garden of the house.

Informally, a code is non-malleable if the message contained in a modified code-word is either the original message, or a completely unrelated value. Non-malleable codes provide a useful and meaningful security guarantee in situations where traditional error-correction and error-detection is impossible; for example, when the attacker can completely overwrite the encoded message. Although such codes do not exist if the family of \\"tampering functions\\" F is completely unrestricted, they are known to exist for many broad tampering families F.  Background   Tampering experiment  To know the operation schema of non-malleable code, we have to have a knowledge of the basic experiment it based on. The following is the three step method of tampering experiment. # A source message s is encoded via a (possibly randomized) procedure Enc, yielding a code-word c = Enc(s). # The code-word is modified under some tampering-function f\\\\in F to an erroneous-code-word c^*=f(c). # The erroneous-code-word c^* is decoded using a procedure Dec , resulting in a decoded-message s^*= Dec(c^*). The tampering experiment can be used to model several interesting real-world settings, such as data transmitted over a noisy channel, or adversarial tampering of data stored in the memory of a physical device. Having this experimental base, we would like to build special encoding/decoding procedures (Enc,Dec), which give us some meaningful guarantees about the results of the above tampering experiment, for large and interesting families F of tampering functions. The following are several possibilities for the type of guarantees that we may hope for.  Error correction  One very natural guarantee, called error-correction, would be to require that for any tampering function and any source-message s, the tampering experiment always produces the correct decoded message s^* = s.  Error detection  A weaker guarantee, called error-detection, requires that the tampering-experiment always results in either the correct value s^* = s or a special symbol s^* = \\\\perp indicating that tampering has been detected. This notion of error-detection is a weaker guarantee than error- correction, and achievable for larger F of tampering functions.  Algorithm description A non-malleable code ensures that either the tampering experiment results in a correct decoded-message s^* = s, or the decoded- message s^* is completely independent of and unrelated to the source-message s. In other word, the notion of non-malleability for codes is similar, in spirit, to notions of non-malleability for cryptographic primitives (such as encryption2, commitments and zero-knowledge proofs), introduced by the seminal work of Dolev, Dwork and Naor. Compared to error correction or error detection, the \\"right\\" formalization of non-malleable codes is somewhat harder to define. Let Tamper^f_s be a random variable for the value of the decoded- message, which results when we run the tampering experiment with source- message s and tampering-function f, over the randomness of the encoding procedure. Intuitively, we wish to say that the distribution of Tamper^f_s is independent of the encoded message s. Of course, we also want to allow for the case where the tampering experiment results in s^* = s (for example, if the tampering function is identity), which clearly depends on s. Thus, we require that for every tampering-function f\\\\in F, there exists a distribution D_f which outputs either concrete values s^* or a special same * symbol, and faithfully models the distribution of Tamper^f_s for all s in the following sense: for every source message s, the distributions of Tamper^f_s and D_f are statistically close when the * symbol is interpreted as s. That is, D_f correctly simulates the \\"outcome\\" of the tampering-experiment with a function f\\\\in F without knowing the source-messages s, but it is allowed some ambiguity by outputting a same * symbol to indicate that the decoded-message should be the same as the source-message, without specifying what the exact value is. The fact that D_f depends on only f and not on s, shows that the outcome of Tamper^f_s is independent of s, exempting equality.  Relation to error correction/detection  Notice that non-malleability is a weaker guarantee than error correction/detection; the latter ensure that any change in the code-word can be corrected or at least detected by the decoding procedure, whereas the former does allow the message to be modified, but only to an unrelated value. However, when studying error correction/detection we usually restrict ourselves to limited forms of tampering which preserve some notion of distance (e.g., usually hamming distance) between the original and tampered code-word. For example, it is already impossible to achieve error correction/detection for the simple family of functions F_{const} which, for every constant c^*, includes a \\"constant\\" function f_{c^*} that maps all inputs to c^*. There is always some function in F_{const} that maps everything to a valid code-word c^*. In contrast, it is trivial to construct codes that are non-malleable w.r.t F_{const}, as the output of a constant function is clearly independent of its input. The prior works on non-malleable codes show that one can construct non-malleable codes for highly complex tampering function families F for which error correction/detection can not be achievable.  Application over tampering functions   Bit-wise independent tampering  As one very concrete example, we study non- malleability with respect to the family of functions f which specify, for each bit of the code-word c, whether to keep it as is, flip it, set it to 0, set it to 1. That is, each bit of the code-word is modified arbitrarily but independently of the value of the other bits of the code-word. We call this the ‚Äúbit-wise independent tampering‚Äù family F_{BIT}. Note that this family contains constant functions F_{const} and constant-error functions F_{err} as subsets. Therefore, as we have mentioned, error-correction and error-detection cannot be achieved w.r.t. this family. Nevertheless, the following can show an efficient non-malleable code for this powerful family. With F_{BIT} we denote the family which contains all tampering functions that tamper every bit independently. Formally, this family contains all functions f_i: \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{0},{1}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}^n \\\\to \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{0},{1}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}^n that are defined by n functionsf_i: \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{0},{1}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\to \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{0},{1}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} (for i=1...n) as f(c_1..c_n)=f_1(c_1)..f_n(c_n). Note that there are only 4 possible choices for each f_i (i.e. how to modify a particular bit) and we name these ‚Äúset to 0‚Äù, ‚Äúset to 1‚Äù, ‚Äúflip‚Äù, ‚Äúkeep‚Äù where the meanings should be intuitive. We call the above family the bit-wise independent tampering family.  All families of bounded size  * Probabilistic Method Approach For any \\"small enough\\" function family F, there exists a (possibly inefficient) coding scheme which is non-malleable w.r.t. F. Moreover, for a fixed \\"small enough\\" function family F, a random coding scheme is likely to be non-malleable w.r.t. F with overwhelming probability. Unfortunately, random coding schemes cannot be efficiently represented, nor is the encoding/decoding function likely to be efficient. Therefore, this result should merely be thought of as showing \\"possibility\\" and providing a target that we should then strive to match constructively. Moreover, this result also highlights the difference between \\"error-correction/detection\\" and \\"non-malleability\\" since a result of this form could not be true for the former notions. * Random Oracle Model Approach It is not clear what the bound from the theorem of this type actually implies. For example, it does tell us that non-malleable codes exist with respect to all efficient functions, but this is misleading as we know that efficient non- malleable codes (and ultimately we are only interested in such) cannot be non- malleable w.r.t. this class. Nevertheless, the result by the probabilistic method does give us codes which are non-malleable w.r.t. very general classes of functions in the random oracle model.  Model of tamper-resilient security  In this model, we consider two ways of interacting with the system: Execute(x): A user can provide the system with Execute(x) queries, for x\\\\in \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{0},{1}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}^u, in which case the system computes (y,s^') \\\\gets G(x,s), updates the state of the system to s :=s^' and outputs y. Tamper(f): We also consider tampering attacks against the system, modeled by Tamper(f) commands, for functions f: \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{0},{1}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}^n \\\\to \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{0},{1}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}^n. Upon receiving such command, the system state is set to s := f(s). An attacker that can also interact with the system via Tamper queries can potentially learn significantly more about the secret state, even recover it entirely. Therefore, we would like to have a general method for securing systems against tampering attacks, so that the ability to issue Tamper queries (at least for functions f in some large family F) cannot provide the attacker with additional information. By using non-malleable code for this purpose we have the conclusion: Let (Enc,Dec) be any coding scheme which is non-malleable w.r.t F, then (Enc,Dec) can also be tamper-simulate w.r.t. F.  Capacity of non-malleable codes  # For every family F with |F|\\\\leq 2^{2^{\\\\alpha n}}, there exist non-malleable codes against F with rate arbitrarily close to 1 ‚àí \\\\alpha (this is achieved w.h.p. by a randomized construction). # For families of size exp( n^{O(1)}2^{\\\\alpha n}) against which there is no non-malleable code of rate 1 ‚àí \\\\alpha (in fact this is the case w.h.p for a random family of this size). # 1 ‚àí \\\\alpha is the best achievable rate for the family of functions which are only allowed to tamper the first \\\\alpha n bits of the code-word, which is of special interest.

It was the last Ferrari racing sports car with a front-mounted engine and the last of a series of Ferrari race cars known as the Testa Rossas. The \\"I\\" in its designation indicates that the car has an independent rear suspension (indipendente in Italian). Beginning in 1960 as a 250 TRI/60 Fantuzzi Spyder (chassis 0780TR), the car was badly damaged in a crash during a practice session for the 1960 Targa Florio road race (its debut). It was rebuilt, failing to finish at the 1960 24 Hours of Le Mans then finishing second at the 1961 12 Hours of Sebring, before being damaged again in its second Targa Florio outing. After finishing second at the 1961 N√ºrburgring 1000km and 1961 24 Hours of Le Mans, it won at the 1961 Pescara 4 Hours. Following Pescara, regulatory changes allowed Ferrari to rebuild 0780TR into its final form as the 330 TRI/LM (chassis 0808), with a larger 4.0 liter V12 engine and a new body. The 330 TRI/LM won the 1962 24 Hours of Le Mans, the last front-engine car to win the race. It was then sold to Luigi Chinetti's NART, competing in North America with some success before returning to the 1963 24 Hours of Le Mans. The car was running in third place into the night against newer, factory-mid-engine Ferrari prototypes when it crashed and dropped out of the race. The 330 TRI/LM's racing career ended after the 1963 24 Hours of Le Mans and it was subsequently repaired and rebuilt as a road car. Since then, it has been owned by several different collectors and restored back to 1962 specification. The car most recently sold to Gregorio P√©rez Companc, who paid ‚Ç¨7,000,000 in 2007. Background The Testa Rossa family began in 1956 with a customer request for a two-liter, four-cylinder sports car capable of defeating arch-rival Maserati's 200 S. This resulted in the creation of the 500 TR, a two-seater spider with engine and suspension based on the Tipo 500 Formula Two car. The 500 TR first raced at the 1956 1000 km Monza, where Peter Collins and Mike Hawthorn took it to its maiden win, with 500 TRs also placing 2nd and 4th. The unlimited-displacement class of the World Sportscar Championship was ended in response to the accident at the 1957 Mille Miglia, as the ruling bodies of motor racing attempted to make racing safer by reducing engine power and thus overall speed. The World Sportscar Championship then imposed a three-liter displacement limit, which Ferrari supported to accommodate American racer-customers. In response, Ferrari developed the 1957 250 TR, based on the 500 TR chassis but now powered by a highly tuned version of the 250 series Colombo-designed V12. The 250 TR achieved great racing success from 1957 though 1961, although by the end of the 1961 season the 3 liter engine and front-engine, rear-wheel-drive chassis were showing their age. The 330 TRI/LM was the final development of the Testa Rossa platform, before mid-engined cars such as the 250 P took over this racing category. History  Origin as a 250 TRI60  The car was originally built as a Fantuzzi-bodied 250 TRI60 (0780TR), leaving the factory in March 1960. The car debuted with Scuderia Ferrari at the 1960 Targa Florio, where it was badly damaged by Cliff Allison during a practice session following a tire blowout. The car was rebuilt with parts from a wrecked 250 TR59/60 (0772TR) and subsequently raced at the 1960 24 Hours of Le Mans. Driven by Willy Mairesse and Richie Ginther, it retired with a broken driveshaft in the Sunday morning. The car returned to the factory to be modified with a TRI61-style high rear body with Kamm tail, retaining its 250 TRI/60 front end. In this form the car was used as an aerodynamic test bed by Carlo Chiti and Giotto Bizzarrini to develop the new 1961 TRI61 body. It returned to racing in the 1961 season for the 12 Hours of Sebring, driven by Giancarlo Baghetti, Mairesse, Ginther and Wolfgang von Trips, finishing second overall behind teammates Phil Hill and Olivier Gendebien. At the Targa Florio it was team's sole front-engine entry, with Mairesse and Pedro Rodr√≠guez driving. They retired after one of the drivers crashed during practice. 0780TR returned to the factory for repairs and modification of its nose to TRI/61 style. This was completed in time for the car to be run by the factory- supported North American Racing Team in the 1961 1000 km N√ºrburgring. Driven by Pedro Rodr√≠guez and his younger brother Ricardo, the car finished second behind the Maserati Tipo 61 of Lloyd Casner and Masten Gregory. The Rodriguez brothers had to pit late in the race after destroying a front wheel, eliminating any chance of a win. The car then was entered by Scuderia Ferrari in the 1961 24 Hours of Le Mans, driven by Mairesse and Mike Parkes. After a poor start, they finished second, again behind Hill and Gendebien. They ran third for much of the race, achieving second when the Rodr√≠guez brothers' 250 TRI61 retired with broken pistons with two hours to go. In the season-ending Pescara 4 Hours 0780TR was driven to victory by Scuderia Ferrari's Lorenzo Bandini and Giorgio Scarlatti, despite an oil leak that saw Bandini fall back to 27th. From this position, he regained second place with his rapid pace and won when the leading Camoradi Maserati Tipo 61 retired. Rebirth as 330 TRI/LM Ferrari had dominated sports-car racing since 1958, with three World Sportscar Championships and three 24 Hours of Le Mans victories in four attempts. In 1962, the CSI (Commission Sportive Internationale) and ACO (Automobile Club de l'Ouest) restructured their rules and classifications to emphasize GT cars and make the three-litre sports-racing class (dominated by cars like the 250 TR) obsolete. The displacement limit for GT cars and the new experimental class was raised to four litres. At this time, Ferrari replaced its sports racers with mid-engine designs and V6s or V8s and decided to rebuild chassis 0780TR as the 330 TRI/LM for the experimental class. This chassis was to be the only 330 TRI/LM ever built. The transformation of 250 TRI60 0780TR to the 330 TRI/LM involved significant changes to the engine, body and chassis. The 3 liter 250 series engine was replaced by a Tipo 163 4-litre Colombo V12 with free-breathing cylinder heads, larger valves, six twin-barrel Weber 42DCN carburetors and dry sump lubrication. This engine provided at 7500 rpm, 50 bhp more than the 250 TR and with a power/displacement ratio of almost 100 hp/liter. The five-speed transaxle was modified with strengthened gears to handle the additional power. The new 4-liter V12 was longer than the 250TR's 3-litre Colombo engine, necessitating a new chassis frame to suit the engine and to comply with the new regulations. The frame was longer to the 250 TR's for better balance, strengthened to accommodate the increased power and torque and accommodated the TRI/61's independent coil-spring suspension system. The transformation was completed with a new body by Fantuzzi with aerodynamic roll hoop as well as a new chassis number, 0808. 1962 24 Hours of Le Mans The 330 TRI/LM made its debut on the second day of the Le Mans test sessions in April. Driven by defending winners Phil Hill and Olivier Gendebien for Scuderia Ferrari, it recorded the fastest lap of the day (4 minutes, 10.8 seconds) despite the wet weather. The 330 TRI/LM skipped the next two World Championship races in favor of further in-house development. During the race's practice session, the car was seconds quicker than the competition when Hill broke Mike Hawthorn's lap record. It was not difficult to drive, as Hill said in Road & Track: The 330 TRI/LM did not have the aerodynamic lift which had caused steering problems at high speed that plagued earlier Ferraris. According to Hill, \\"It didn‚Äôt exhibit that schizophrenic nature\\" of being pleasant to drive on slow, tight portions of the circuit but unpleasant on faster portions (for example, the White House turn). He concluded that \\"[without the] strange nose or tail liftings the 330 was a nice, almost pleasant car to drive.\\" Co-driver Gendebien had a different opinion of the car, describing it as: The drivers had problems with a slipping clutch since the first practice session, when the engine was at peak torque as the car accelerated. This was resolved by \\"treat[ing] the car as gently as possible\\" and correct shift timing requiring the drivers to shift \\"a gear higher\\" than usual). Hill and Gendebien did not expect the car to last the entire duration of the race. Despite a slow start by Gendebien and ongoing clutch slippage, the 330 TRI/LM's speed enabled him to gain the lead, fending off the Ferrari 246 SP of the Rodr√≠guez brothers and briefly, the Aston Martin DP212 of Graham Hill and Richie Ginther. When the Rodr√≠guez brothers retired at 4.30 am with gearbox issues, Hill and Gendebien inherited a four-lap lead which they increased to five by the end. They thus became the first triple winner driver pairing, with Gendebien becoming the first four-time winner. The 330 TRI/LM was the last front-engine car to achieve an overall win at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Racing history after 1962 Le Mans Following its victory, the 330 TRI/LM was ineligible to compete in any more European races as intended by Ferrari that season. Chinetti's NART, responsible for Ferrari's North American operations, acquired it as a middle man for Don Rodr√≠guez to enable his son Pedro to race in North America. Upon receiving the car, NART mechanics immediately removed the aerodynamic roll hoop as Chinetti believed it increased drag. The younger Rodr√≠guez won the 1962 Bridgehampton Grand Prix at Bridgehampton and finished second in the 1962 Canadian Grand Prix at Mosport. For the 1962 Nassau Trophy, Masten Gregory substituted for Rodr√≠guez, who was unable to drive after his brother fatally crashed at the Mexican Grand Prix. Gregory finished fourth. In 1963, Graham Hill and Rodr√≠guez drove the 330 TRI/LM to a third-place finish at the 12 Hours of Sebring behind newer Scuderia Ferrari mid-engine 250 P prototypes. At one point, they held a 3-lap lead over the 250 Ps until mechanical and electrical problems slowed the car down, as well as the driver having to deal with exhaust fumes caused by split exhaust manifold. NART entered the 330 TRI/LM in the 1963 24 Hours of Le Mans to defend its title, upgraded with wider tires. Pedro Rodr√≠guez and Roger Penske drove. They started the race from the pole position but trailed in second place against the Scuderia Ferrari entries until the ninth hour when the engine threw a connecting rod. Oil spilled on the rear tires, causing the car to crash and taking along Jo Bonnier's Porsche 718/8 GTR with it. Driver Penske was uninjured but the car was severely damaged and never raced again.  Collector ownership  Following the crash at the 1963 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 330 TRI/LM was sent to the Ferrari factory for repair. At this time a new coup√© body was made by Fantuzzi and the car was subsequently returned to Chinetti in the United States as a road car. Hisashi Okada of Long Island brought the car in 1965 and drove it daily on the streets of Manhattan before trading it for a 250 LM in 1974. The car was then sold via Stanley Nowak to Pierre Bardinon. Like Okada, Bardinon also drove the car in New York City up through 1993. In 1974, he commissioned Fantuzzi to restore the car back to its 1962 form, whilst the coup√© body was transferred to a 250 GT Coup√© (chassis 1087GT). The car was later sold by Bardinon on June 12, 2002 to Rob Myers for US$5,800,000. It was then put up for auction by RM Sotheby's in Monterey, CA on August 17, 2002. It sold at this auction for US$6,500,000 including buyer's premium to Jim Spiro, a money manager from New Orleans. Spiro drove it in road rallies and frequently used it to commute in city traffic. The car narrowly avoided the 2005 devastation of Hurricane Katrina when, two days before the storm, Spiro drove it west of New Orleans to his friend's garage. The 330 TRI/LM was last sold at RM Sotheby's 2007 Maranello auction, after an unsuccessful auction attempt two years earlier. The buyer was Gregorio P√©rez Companc, who paid ‚Ç¨7,000,000 including buyer's premium.

Male forms of P. shiozawai have a body length 24.3-28.4 mm and a maximal width of 0.084-0.104 mm. The esophagus is approximately 0.248-0.280 mm long and 0.028-0.036 mm wide. The males have a short bursa. The female forms of P. Shiozawai have a posterior body measuring 19mm in length, and a width of approximately 0.104-0.125mm long. Its esophagus measures 0.318-0.326mm long.  Host  The relationship between serow and Protostrongylus shiozawaiis highly specific. In a study done by Murakami et al., P. shoizawai were found in over 70% of all wild serows. Upon examination, those infected had had pulmonary lesions caused by this nematode. The lesions were found to be granulomas caused by the serow's immune system. There is concern about the overlapping serow habitat with sheep. Many other parasitic nematodes belonging to the same genus also parasitize sheep-like animals i.e. P. stilesi and P. rushi in bighorn sheep, P. rufescens in mouflons, and P. rupicaprae in chamois. Though since 1975 P. shiozawai have only been found in serows, further studies are required to study the relationship of P. shiozawai in other animals.

It was founded by Thomas Strangeways in 1905 as the Cambridge Research Hospital and acquired its current name in 1928. Organised as an independent charity, it was historically funded primarily by the Medical Research Council and is currently managed by the University of Cambridge, also its sole trustee. Formerly a site of research on rheumatic arthritis and connective tissue disorders, it has since 1997 focused on the study of genetic epidemiology. History Honor Fell working at a microscope The institution was founded in 1905 as the Cambridge Research Hospital by physician Thomas Strangeways, who sought to study patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and related conditions. Funded by a combination of Strangeways' own contributions, support from noted doctors of the time, and donations from patients, the hospital began modestly with only six beds, and with research equipment located in renovated coal sheds. It closed briefly in 1908 due to lack of funding, but quickly reopened and moved to its current site in 1912 thanks to the support of Otto Beit. It was temporarily repurposed as a hospital for military officers in World War I but returned to use as a research site in 1917. Subsequently, in 1923, Strangeways moved the clinical aspects of his work to St Bartholomew's Hospital in order to focus research efforts at the laboratory on then-emerging technologies in tissue culture and cell biology. Honor Fell's work area at Strangeways, ca. 1950 Following Strangeways' death in 1926, the laboratory's future and finances were in doubt; advocates of keeping the laboratory open included F.G. Spear and Strangeways' protege Honor Fell, a scientist employed there at the time of Strangeways' death. Funding was obtained largely from the Medical Research Council and the name was changed to Strangeways Research Laboratory in honour of its founder. Fell became the new director of the laboratory and served in that position from 1928 to 1970, while also maintaining an active research program in tissue and organ culture throughout her directorship. Fell was succeeded as director by Michael Abercrombie in 1970, but returned to Strangeways as a scientist in 1979 and continued work until shortly before her death in 1986. A rare example of a woman in a senior management position at the time, Fell is noted for her work supporting scientific careers for women at Strangeways during her tenure as director. The laboratory was never well-funded, and Fell described the funding situation as \\"something of a nightmare\\". Nevertheless, it developed a reputation for excellence in the fields of cell biology, tissue culture, and radiobiology that attracted a wide range of visiting scientists. In the 1930s, the laboratory described itself as a center for development of tissue culture work and of basic research with potential applications to human medicine. The laboratory hosted the first scientific research position held by Francis Crick, who performed part-time research in the late 1940s, supported by Fell. Present In 1997 the laboratory was restructured, shifting research focus to genetic epidemiology. It is currently managed by the Department of Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge under the directorship of epidemiologist John Danesh.

The formal proposal for the Valley of Peace initiative began with a joint proposal in 2008 to build a canal between the Red and Dead Seas, desalinating the water, producing hydroelectric power and yielding profits, clean water, jobs and potentially unprecedented regional cooperation. The study concluded in 2013, and an agreement was signed in 2013 by Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority to move ahead with the plan. In February 2015, Israel and Jordan signed an agreement to exchange water and jointly convey Red Sea brine to the shrinking Dead Sea. The agreement was reported to be worth about $800 million. It was the result of a memorandum of understanding signed among Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian officials on December 9, 2013, in Washington. Under this agreement, Jordan and Israel will share the potable water produced by a future desalination plant in Aqaba, while a pipeline will supply saltwater to the Dead Sea.Israel, Jordan sign historic plan to save Dead Sea, By Sharon Udasin, jpost.com 02/27/2015.Israel Desalinization Technology Leads to ‚ÄúHistoric‚Äù Agreement with Jordan, israelideas.org, April 22, 2015. In December 2015, Israel and Jordan formally released the technical plans to move ahead with this project. A new desalination plant to be built near the Jordanian tourist resort of Aqaba would convert salt water from the Red Sea into fresh water for use in southern Israel and southern Jordan; each region would get eight billion to 13 billion gallons a year. This process would produces about as much brine as a waste product; the brine would be piped more than 100 miles to help replenish the Dead Sea, already known for its high salt content. This would reinforce the status of the Dead Sea as an important economic resource to both nations, in multiple areas including tourism, industry and business, to create up to a million new jobs in Israel and the West Bank.

The company G.ho.st has offices in both Modiin and Ramallah. Palestinians have benefited from large amounts of venture capital available through Israeli contacts. Israeli involvement began by benefiting from the labor costs and salary levels in Palestinian society, where various Israeli business have already outsourced some business. Over time, the project became a partnership, owing to a large number of new Palestinian college graduates who studied information science and needed new business opportunities.Israelis and Palestinians Launch Web Start-Up By DINA KRAFT, New York Times, May 29, 2008. Investors as individuals and companies, such as Michael Eisenberg of Benchmark Capital have sought to invest funds based on G.ho.st's long-term goals to create a totally web-based computer environment, free of any need for traditional software applications. Another significant connection has been through Noa Rothman, granddaughter of Yitzchak Rabin, whose organization promotes joint dialogue.

Production Prior to working on Ch≈çsh≈çjo Reiko, director Takao Okawara worked as an assistant director at Toho often pitching ideas for a script that were ignored. Okawara decided to develop a story and enter it into a competition and if he would win, it would get better attention from upper staff at Toho. Okawara developed a story that he stated had a \\"sellable script\\" aimed at teenage audiences which persuaded him to include a fantasy element of Extrasensory perception. He submitted his story to the Kido Awards which it won second place. This influenced Toho to allow Okawara to direct it. The films cast included Arisa Mizuki who was an unknown actress at the time and would be known as a super model by 2000. Okawara described the shooting of the film as difficult, stating that the films low budget did not allow him to have a special effects director for the film, making him do both. Release Ch≈çsh≈çjo Reiko was distributed theatrically in Japan by Toho on November 16, 1991. Norman England of Fangoria stated the film failed to find an audience in Japan referring to it as a \\"box-office dud.\\" The films producer Shogo Tomiyama felt that despite the film not being strong in the box office, he thought the film was good enough that they would allow Okawara to direct later films in the Godzilla film series.

Early life  John Lundie Michie was born on 4 June 1882 in Lochnalair, Crathie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. He attended Robert Gordon's College in Aberdeen, Scotland winning a Classics Gold Medal in 1899. He graduated with an M.A. and first class honours in classics in 1904 from the University of Aberdeen. He was awarded the Ferguson classical scholarship in his final year at Aberdeen. He was an equally enthusiastic athlete as he was a scholar, with skills in the hammer and shot put, and in mountaineering. He would continue his studies at Trinity College, Cambridge, earning a double first in the classical Tripos and his B.A. from Cambridge in 1907. This would be followed by his M.A. in 1911.  Career  In 1908, Michie returned to the University of Aberdeen, and became an assistant to the Professor of Humanity, Sir William Ramsay. He would become lecturer in Roman history at Cambridge in 1909. In 1910, Michie applied for and was appointed to the chair in Classics at the newly established University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. He would travel to Australia with another of the new appointments, Henry Priestley and his wife. Both Priestley and Michie would become strong supporters of the athletics events of the new University. Michie's presence at the university occurred at a key time in debate within the Queensland government and the university's establishment, as he and then Governor Sir William MacGregor would take the side of recommending that classics be a prerequisite for enrolment in the Arts program. Others would take the line that this was not appropriate to the needs of a modern Queensland. Michie was kept busy in his first years at the university, designing the Classics Honour program and doing much of the teaching of classes. His design of the courses in Classics would remain the template for the next 40 years. His nickname was \\"Michie Mouse\\", in reference to his quiet nature rather than stature, as he was very tall and had trouble fitting around tables during class. His shy nature and lack of confidence in public speaking was noticed, but he was generally thought of as the \\"rock\\" of the university. Michie would become chairman (1911‚Äì1922) and dean of the Faculty of Arts (1928‚Äì1932 and again 1939‚Äì1946), a member of the University Senate (1916‚Äì1923 and 1926‚Äì1932) and president of the Board of Faculties (1917‚Äì1922), demonstrating his commitment to the administration and teaching of the new University. He was well liked by his students, being kind, courteous and shy, but rarely spoke at public events, and had little time to publish. He did give public lectures in the 1920s on Greece, Rome and Crete. His energies were directed entirely at his teaching and administrative duties. He and fellow Professors Alcock and Lusby were also involved in the university's extension courses in 1922, offered at five shillings a meeting. Michie sat on the Library Committee, which struggled to achieve the funding needed to improve the library's facilities. In 1935, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws for his service to the university. He was also president of the UQ Athletic Club and a judge at many events. In February,1946, Michie took leave from the university due to ill health. He died 23 June 1946.  Personal life  Michie married Isabella Sword in 1926 in the Presbyterian Church of Stanthorpe, Queensland. He was survived by his wife and two daughters.  Legacy  Michie left an estate of ¬£33, 753, and from this bequests were made to the University of Queensland and University of Aberdeen. The J.L. Michie memorial scholarship fund was created by former students and colleagues to benefit honours students in classics, and prizes continue to be offered today. The Michie building, a building that faces the Great Court of the University of Queensland was named for him in the 1970s, in recognition of his dedication to humanities and classics in particular. It features the RD Milns Antiquities Museum and the UQ Anthropology Museum. A stone grotesque in his likeness was also carved in the university's Great Court. Two of his most distinguished students included writer, Jack Lindsay and Eric Partridge.

Marietta Walker (1834‚Äì1930) is an American credited as the \\"mother\\" of Graceland University. Early life and education Marietta Hodges was born to Curtis and Lucy Clark Hodges on April 10, 1834, in Willoughby, Ohio. Curtis was from New York and Lucy from Vermont; their involvement in the Church of the Latter Day Saints led them to move to Ohio. The Hodges joined other church members as they moved from Ohio to Far West, Missouri, where they purchased a 320-acre farm. Armed conflict later broke out between the Latter Day Saint group and other Missouri settlers, and when Marietta was just four years old, her father was shot in this conflict. On October 27, 1838, Missouri Governor Lilburn W. Boggs issued the Mormon Extermination Order, which led Latter Day Saints to leave the state. Walker and her family were among the thousands who fled and settled in Nauvoo, Illinois. Walker was nearly ten when church president Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were murdered; in a later article entitled \\"A Picture From Memory's Wall\\", Walker would recall seeing their dead bodies. Later, Walker's three brothers were falsely accused of committing a series of robberies that had occurred in Lee County, Iowa. Her brothers were executed; half a century later it was determined that they had been innocent. After this event, Curtis and Lucy Hodges took the remainder of their family to Pennsylvania, where Walker's father died of illness and distress. Later, Walker was enrolled in a school for girls, she and her mother Lucy lived with one of Lucy‚Äôs married daughters. After she graduated, Walker became an assistant teacher. During this time, she converted to the Methodist Church. Walker subsequently returned to Ohio, where she graduated from Oxford Female College in 1859. After learning that her sister Elizabeth Lyons had died, leaving behind two small daughters, she moved to Texas to care for the girls and became principal of the San Antonio Female College. In 1860, Walker married Confederate soldier Robert Falconer. To them, a daughter Lucy was born. Shortly after their daughter's birth, Falconer died. Walker returned to Illinois when it appeared that her mother was nearing the end of her life. She learned that her mother had converted to the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS), and Walker herself subsequently converted as well. She decided to do what she could to help with the growth of her new church. Involvement in the church Walker prepared the Inspired Version of the Holy Scriptures for printing. She later helped to copy the manuscript. On November 7, 1869, she married Samuel Frye Walker, a philosopher, student, writer, and rancher. They moved to Nevada where they had two daughters, Francis and Lois. They then moved to what became known as Lamoni, Iowa, in 1877 to participate in building an RLDS community. While living in Lamoni, they secured land for a farm and went into the dairy business, raising large herds of cattle. In October, 1881 the Herald Publishing House was moved to Lamoni. The Walker family left their farm and moved into town. Samuel Frye Walker died soon after. Following her husband's death, Marietta devoted her time and literary talents to the church. Marietta Walker wrote to the \\"Mothers' Home Column\\" in pursuit of raising money for a boat to use in the French Polynesian islands. In less than three years enough money was collected from offerings and a book of poetry Walker wrote entitled Afterglow. Involvement in the school Within the RLDS Church, Walker advocated for a college or school of advanced study in Lamoni. She donated 25 acres of her own farmland for the project and secured a donation from a W. A. Hopkins for an adjoining parcel of 13 acres. The school, which would be called Graceland University, was completed in the winter of 1896 and opened with three faculty members and 21 students. The first dormitory was for boys and was built in 1899. The girls' dormitory was built in 1906 but burned down in 1926. After a period in which the recitation hall served as a temporary residence for the girls, a new girl's dormitory was opened in 1929. It was named Walker Hall in her honor. For all of her efforts in founding Graceland University, Walker is referred to as the \\"mother of Graceland.\\" Marietta never wanted recognition, she often wrote under the name of Frances. She encouraged others to work for the service they could give and not for the honor they might receive. Walker's life motto was, \\"Get thy spindle and thy distaff ready, and God will send thee flax,\\" With the coming of old age, vision, and hearing loss, Walker died in California on April 12, 1930, at the age of ninety-six. She was buried with her husband in Rose Hill Cemetery in Lamoni, Iowa.

Public Domain. The minutes of their meetings shed important light on the oft- debated question of the Puritan ministers influence on the witchcraft trials.  Membership  When they joined, ministers signed the book. The record-book suggests Charles Morton and Cotton Mather were the two important founding members of the group. Together with the bylaws, the two men's names give the appearance of sharing the same ink, and at the first (or second) organizational pre-meeting, on October 13, 1690, Cotton Mather is listed as the one who will tell Harvard that the group will have their first official meeting in the library a week later, on October 20. Charles Morton was the most senior and placed his name at the top and Cotton Mather signed lower, perhaps leaving space in between for other designated members to sign in order of seniority, including James Allen (Boston First Church), Michael Wigglesworth (HU 1651), Joshua Moodey (H.U. 1653), Samuel Willard (HU 1659, Boston South Church), John Bailey, and Nathaniel Gookin (HU 1675, d. Aug 15, 1692). Four of these men -- Morton, Allen, Moodey, and Willard-- had also signed an introduction to Cotton Mather's book Memorable Providences the year before in 1689. Increase Mather did not return from London until May, 1692, and likely signed the book, next to James Allen's name, soon after his return and he is first listed as definitely present on June 27, 1692. Nehemiah Walter (HU 1684) was Increase Mather's son-in-law and doesn't seem to have been present until around the time Increase Mather joined. Jonathan Pierpont (HU 1685) is also first noted as present on August 1, 1692. Others joined later, sometimes years later, and they seem to have eventually begun to sign the designated page of the book in a jumbled order, where space permitted, including: Jabez Fox and John Fox, James Sherman, Benjamin Woodbridge, Benjamin Wadsworth (H.U. 1690 and future President), Benjamin Colman (HU 1692), William Brattle (HU 1680), Ebenezer Pemberton (HU 1691), Samuel Angier (HU 1673), John Fox, Henry Gibbs, and Thomas Bridge. Although some these men worked at Harvard as tutors, fellows, and library-keepers, and thus may have been present in some capacity at meetings in the library, it is unlikely any joined officially before being ordained as a minister.  Advising Salem  Advice regarding Salem in 1692 One of the first orders of business taken up by the new group of ministers was to discuss a letter from Rev. Samuel Parris in Salem Village concerning his troubles there. Parris visited the Harvard Library for another meeting scheduled only one week later on October 20, 1690. See above photo and Cambridge Association Minutes. On June 27 1692, during the height of the witchcraft trials, Cotton Mather proposed a question for the group, \\"Whether the devils may not sometimes have permission to represent an innocent person as tormenting such as are under diabolical molestations?\\"See photo and minutes are also reprinted, Cambridge Association Minutes. In other words, Mather is contemplating whether it is possible for someone accused of witchcraft to be innocent, a position that is nearly the opposite of presumed innocence. The question was discussed at the next meeting August 1, and in Increase Mather's handwriting the conclusion was recorded, \\"All did agree to the affirmative... [that false accusations can happen]... but that such things are rare and extraordinary especially when such matters come before civil judicature.\\" ibid. Numerous executions of accused persons followed this go- ahead to the court. In 1694, when apologizing to his congregation, Rev. Parris seems to refer to the same Mather question, but by this time Parris comes down definitively on the side of presumed innocence. Parris writes, \\"I question not but God sometimes suffers the Devil, as of late, to afflict in shape of not only innocent, but pious persons, or so to delude the senses of the afflicted, that they strongly conceit their hurt is from such persons, when indeed it is not.\\" Parris \\"Acknowledgements\\" recorded by Robert Calef in a book sent to England in 1697 and printed in 1700, p 58. Parris also transcribed the same into the Salem Village church records and these were later reprinted by Upham, Vol II, Appendix IV. In contrast to the Mather's \\"rare and extraordinary,\\" Parris has increased the frequency to \\"sometimes.\\" Parris' use of the word \\"delude\\" is also notable because this was a term long associated with skepticism and the Calvinistic doctrinal view opposed to a belief in the validity of acts of witchcraft. \\"And we should remember that Satan has his wonders, which, though they are juggling tricks rather than real miracles, are such as to delude the ignorant and inexperienced.\\" Jean Calvin's Institutes, 1559, prefatory address to the king.  Arrangements & By-laws  The group met mid-morning on Mondays ‚Äú...once in six weeks, or oftener if need shall be.‚Äù At the end of each meeting the date of the next was chosen. A moderator was also chosen to keep the minutes at the next meeting and he also chose the next question for the group to ponder and discuss. \\"Our work at the said meetings shall be 1) to debate any matter relating to ourselves. 2) To hear and consider any cases which shall be proposed to us from any other associations or private persons. 3) To answer any letters directed to us from any other associations or persons. 4) To discourse of any question proposed at the former meeting.

Despite its availability in the archives, important Salem historians Charles W. Upham and George Lincoln Burr do not seem to have been aware of it, perhaps because it was filed under Morton's name and begins in Cornwall, England. Neither historian cites the record book though it would have supported their arguments.  Later Developments and Offshoots  The group has been claimed as the first formal association of Congregational ministers in America.

It was built from to 1950s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 31 July 2006.  History  The former Parson's Inn buildings are timber vernacular structures located approximately south of Raglan on the old coach road, now bypassed by the Bruce Highway. The proprietor of this wayside inn from 1885 until the early 1900s was Edwin Parson and the property has remained in the possession of members of his family. The area in which the inn is situated was surveyed for pastoral settlement in 1855 and most of County of Clinton was soon taken up as runs producing wool. This included Raglan which was selected by William Landsborough and by 1857 was occupied by James and John Landsborough. By 1865 cattle were established in the district and soon replaced sheep. By 1867 there were over 180 runs in the district and a goldfield was proclaimed at Raglan, just south of Mount Holly. Miners from this field were later to frequent Parson's Inn, paying for their rations in gold. Following the Crown Lands Alienation Act in 1868, the huge early runs were broken up and resumed for selection as smaller grazing properties. The numbers of cattle being raised and transported in the Port Curtis area increased following the setting up of the Lakes Creek meatworks in 1871. Edwin Parson's name first appears in the Post Office Directory of 1874 as being at Long Morn. He selected at Black's Crossing, Raglan, in 1873 and an adjoining selection of in 1874. On 5 May 1979, a mention is made in the diary of Stephen Creed of Langmorn station of an E Parsons \\"in charge of 169 fat bullocks to be delivered to Brisbane by road\\", which may well refer to Edwin Parsons. The purchase of his selections was finalised in 1881. Black's Crossing was the local name for a section of Raglan Creek crossed by a stock route. The places where major routes crossed watercourses were often used as camps by drovers and carriers and were excellent locations for inns which catered to travellers. These were places where one could obtain food and accommodation for people and horses, where it was usually possible to obtain the services of a blacksmith, leave or collect messages and gain information on the condition of the road ahead. The inns were also a social amenity as a source of company and conviviality on the road. Their services made the development of regular supply routes possible, which in turn made a major contribution to the way in which areas were opened up for European settlement. Parson obtained a license for a hostelry named the Raglan Hotel at Black's Crossing in 1885. Although his name appears in most documents as Parsons, it is spelt on the hotel's signboard on a 19th-century photograph without the \\"s\\". He had not held a publican's license before and the license was in his name until 1902. It then passed to Joseph Jones and was held briefly by David Parsons in 1905, after which no further licenses were issued. It is probable that the inn operated only during the period when there was sufficient traffic on this road to support it. The route was also used for mail, a post office having opened in Raglan in 1879, although the mail was carried on horseback until 1887 when a weekly coach served the route. It is not certain whether the building was constructed as an inn, or whether an existing building was modified, but it had both slabs and sawn boards for wall cladding at an early stage of its existence. A saw pit is still visible behind the building. In the use of bush pole frames for the building and window openings, pit sawn weatherboards, pegged floorboards, adzed slabs and other details, the inn provides examples of a range of early building techniques and demonstrates what could be achieved in a remote spot using the materials available to hand. The hotel is described in a diary of Lady Lamington, wife of the Governor of Queensland Lord Lamington between 1896 and 1901. In 1897, while travelling privately to meet her husband at Rockhampton on his return from New Guinea, her boat encountered bad weather and it was agreed that she, her husband's secretary and his wife should hire a vehicle and driver and travel the last section overland. They stayed one night at the Raglan Hotel \\"a wooden hut with some small trees nearby.\\" The hotel was run by a woman and her children, one of whom had recently died and who she had buried, presumably in the vicinity of the inn. Lady Lamington remembered that: > \\"We were shown into the house, one rather small centre room with a sort of > counter on one side for a bar, and behind this room were two or three > bedrooms. The floor and walls were of planks which had shrunk after being > put up, so we could with little effort, see what was going on in the next > room, and as the floor was the same, I used to see the chickens scratching > the ground under the floor between the short wooden piles on which the > little Hotel!!! was built. The walls had coloured and uncoloured > illustrations from different newspapers stuck on them in places, which made > one's room a little more private. There was only one bedroom and a sort of > press with a bed in it. We had only one very small basin between us for our > ablutions. It was easy to empty it by just opening a wooden window, but not > so easy to get the water to fill it again. I have seen a good deal during my > travels but sitting there in the little Bush shanty listening to this good > woman's stories was very touching. Next morning I was woke up by hearing the > children bringing in the cows for milking\\" A photograph, which survives, was taken of the inn on this occasion by Pascoe Stuart, the Governor's secretary. Since then, rooms have been added to the ends of the building, but the simple rectangular form and open area at the front remain. In 1904, some of Parson's land was resumed for the railway which opened in 1910. A new certificate of title was issued to him in 1904 for giving his address as Sunnyside, Raglan. Although the inn was no longer licensed, it appeared as a hotel in the Post Office Directory until 1909 and may still have been used to accommodate travellers. The introduction of the railway no doubt cut traffic considerably on the old road and Edwin Parson was listed in the Post Office Directory as a selector before he died in 1911. The property was left to Walter Parsons who leased it to John Patrick Mitchell in 1912 for 21 years. The Port Curtis Dairy Association was formed in 1906 and opened a dairy co-operative in Gladstone and in Rockhampton in 1928. This provided the opportunity for the development of the dairy industry in the area. For many years, until the late 1950s, the property on which Parson's Inn was located was run as a dairy farm. Walter Parsons lived in a 2 storeyed house nearby, the frame of which is still standing, while a family who worked on the farm occupied the inn. The property passed to Edwin Miles Parsons in February 1961. In 1970 it was surrendered to the Crown and a new Deed of Grant issued on 31 March 1971 for to allow for road resumptions. The land passed to the current owner, also a family member, in 1982. It is over 35 years since the building was occupied and it was used until recently for storing hay. A storm is said to have removed much of the cladding from the rear about 10‚Äì15 years ago. The stables behind the inn recorded in the National Trust's survey of 1981 have gone with no visible trace. The small pole-framed building standing in yards near the house is said to have been used as a dairy. Its age is unknown, but it may be contemporary with the inn as similar construction techniques have been employed. No family documentation relating to the inn is known to survive.  Description  Parsons Inn is located a little south of Raglan Creek, halfway along the old coach road between Gladstone and Rockhampton, which has been bypassed. The former inn is set parallel with the road and is a single-storeyed timber building on low stumps. The building has a frame of bush poles and was originally clad at least partially with slabs, although most of these seem to have been replaced many years ago with weatherboards. The broken back roof is clad in corrugated iron. The front has an open verandah section in the centre and rooms on either side of this. These rooms have been extended. Behind this is a large room with lined walls and ceiling. At the rear are small rooms and a veranda which has lost most of its cladding and a section of roof. The windows are between uprights of bush timber, as are the doors. The floors are of pit-sawn boards fastened to the bearers in places with large rectangular wooden pegs cut from pieces of pit- sawn timber. The sawpit is still visible close behind the building, though it has been filled in for safety reasons. Some sections originally open have been built in. The front wall, most interior walls and the ceilings of the main section are clad with beaded boards. The main room is lined with wide plain boards and has a stencilled dado on the end walls. The upper wall is pale blue and the lower wall pinkish grey, divided by a pink line and a grey/pink stencilled anthemion pattern above. Some boards which carried part of this design have been removed. The former residence is a two-storeyed timber-framed building clad with weatherboards, with verandahs to both levels at each end and a galvanised iron roof. This building is now little more than a frame and is leaning precariously. Beyond this house is a small weatherboard clad building with a pole frame standing in the remains of a post and rail enclosure. A roofed open area adjoins the building and leads into the yard section. There is a windmill and a water tank on stumps alongside. It is thought that there are graves some distance behind the inn, but these were not located. The area around the inn is of value as an archaeological site which may yield further information on the way in which such early wayside inns were operated.  Heritage listing  Parson's Inn was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 31 July 2006 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Raglan Hotel, or Parson's Inn, illustrates the pattern of European settlement in Queensland as a wayside inn serving early an early route for the movement of livestock, essential supplies and mail. Such inns were an important element in the settlement of remote areas. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The inn is rare in Queensland, as although many such travellers' inns were built, few examples using local materials, such as this one, have survived. It is thought that no other example of the technique used to peg the floor boards to the bearers has been identified in Queensland. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The inn, its subsidiary structures and the area around them which formed part of the inn yards have the potential to reveal information about the operation of early hotels in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former Parson's Inn is a good example of its kind and preserves many examples of early building techniques. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The inn has associations with several generations of the Parsons family, who were early settlers in the area.

It is so named because Captain Cook landed there on 24 May 1770. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 March 1996.  History  The town of Seventeen Seventy is so named because on 24 May in that year, Lieutenant James Cook, captain of His Majesty's barque HMS Endeavour, came ashore and landed on the beach of Round Hill Creek in the vicinity of the present village. In the morning of Thursday May 1770, the Lieutenant in his pinnace (with Mr Joseph Banks and Dr Daniel Solander) and Second Lieutenant John Gore in the yawl left the ship for the shore and made their first landing in what is now Queensland and their second landing in Australia. Cook made eleven landings on the eastern seaboard and ten of these were in Queensland. Cook's landing spot at Bustard Bay was in the vicinity of the present caravan park (developed in 1978), where a stream at the southern end enters the beach just north of the remaining mangroves. Cook described the countryside as \\"visibly worse\\" than at Botany Bay, with dry and sandy soils, woods free of undergrowth, the same sort of numerous \\"birch\\" tree (coastal ironbark), mangroves skirting the lagoon and palm trees on low, barren, sandy places. He also noted bustards, black and white ducks, small oysters and other shell fish - mussels, pearl oysters and cockles. Botanist Joseph Banks, who accompanied Cook on his \\"little excursion in to the woods\\", noted the great variety of plants even though the plant cover was not thick. He recognised plants already seen in the Tropics, and described many birds on shore including one species of Bustard. Some of the 55 specimens collected in the general area were illustrated and described in Banks' Florilegium, which was printed from copperplates under Banks' direction from Parkinson's unfinished sketches. (Parkinson died of dysentery on the voyage home.) As the woods behind Round Hill Head and adjacent to Round Hill Creek are the locality of the first botanical type-specimens collected in Queensland, they are of great scientific value. This was recognised in 1989 with the gazettal of Joseph Banks Environmental Park. In August 1802 Matthew Flinders in HM sloop Investigator, accompanied by the Lady Nelson under the command of Lt John Murray, resurveyed Hervey's Bay. They reached the south head of Bustard Bay (Round Hill Head) on 2 August and anchored in nearly the same spot where the Endeavour had lain in 1770. Subsequent early mariners visited Bustard Bay and noted the prominent landmark of Round Hill from Round Hill Head: Captain Phillip King in the Mermaid 1819, Captain Stokes in HMS Beagle in 1839 and 1841, and Colonel Barney in the steamer Cornubia in 1846, when he was looking for a site for northern settlement. Port Curtis was proclaimed a district in January 1854. Most European settlement by-passed Bustard Bay and Round Hill Head, but pastoral runs were taken up in the hinterland. In 1867 a lighthouse was erected at Bustard Head because of increased coastal shipping, and a sawmill was established at Eurimbula Creek. By 1894, Agnes Water beach was a popular weekend resort for sawmill employees. There was a timber shoot down Round Hill and pine logs were hauled by teamsters to the rafting grounds on Oyster Creek and Round Hill Creek. The first cottage at Round Hill was erected in 1915. In July 1925, the Royal Geographical Society of Queensland resolved to erect a monument at Bustard Bay to commemorate the first landing of the British on the Queensland coast. With the support of the Governor of Queensland, Sir Matthew Nathan, a public appeal for funds was launched on 1 September 1925, and proved so popular that a cairn was ordered the following month. This was erected early in 1926, on the point of land overlooking Bustard Bay to the north. In response to a request from the RGSQ for the reservation of an area of land surrounding the Cook Memorial, the Department of Public Lands set aside an area of as a Recreation Reserve under the control of the Miriam Vale Shire as trustee, February 1927. This did not include the site of the actual landing in Bustard Bay. An area was surveyed adjacent to Round Hill Creek for the site of a township in the mid-1930s. It was named Seventeen Seventy, re-emphasising that this was Cook's first landing place in Queensland in May 1770. The significance of Round Hill Head, at the time considered the birthplace of Queensland, drew the attention of those planning the 1970 Bi-Centenary Celebrations. The Queensland Government made available $2,000 for a monument additional to the cairn, to be erected and maintained by the Department of Local Government. The site selected for the new monument was about a mile nearer the tip of Round Hill Head on the western or inshore side, overlooking the spot where the Endeavour had lain. The new monument was not to imitate the existing cairn as simply a marker for the site of Cook's landing, but was intended to symbolise that in landing at this place, the British first opened the door of opportunity in Queensland. A four-sided concrete portico in classical style was erected, with the words Doorway to Destiny on the top- piece. In 1975, the area surrounding the monument was gazetted as the Captain Cook Memorial and Park Reserve. The monument later developed concrete cancer, and was demolished in August 1994. In 1989 the Joseph Banks Environmental Park was gazetted. It covered about , but did not include Cook's actual landing site.  Description  Round Hill Head is a distinctive granite landform at above sea level, a landmark for mariners as the north west extreme of Hervey Bay and the bluff termination of hills, well covered with wood and grass, sloping down around Round Hill, which is high due south. The headland has naturally grassy areas running from the ocean on the east to the sheltered creek on the west and this swathe has been referred to as \\"Mrs Cook's Drive\\" since the turn of the century. Round Hill Creek on the western side of the headland has a very narrow channel, which has maintained its depth at soundings taken since 1770, but is encumbered with shifting sandbanks. The sandy beach is fringed by mangroves and backed by cotton woods, paperbark and palms in the wetter gullies, with ironbark on the drier slopes. From Monument Point extensive views may be obtained of the picturesque inlet with boats at anchor, wisps of smoke from the cottages screened in the bush, distant blue mountains and across the sand spits to the west the dense lowland vegetation of Eurimbula National Park with the jagged Munro Range towering in the distance. At night the Bustard Head lighthouse flashes its warning presence across Bustard Bay. When viewed extensively, European occupation of the land has not altered the landscape irretrievably. Very few of the recent houses intrude into the landscape, mature trees have been retained, and the bush has regenerated on the lower slopes. Very few clumps of mangroves remain in the lower reaches of Round Hill Creek along the western margin but the caravan park developed in 1978 has a cover of mature native trees while the unreserved Crown land along the foreshore adjacent to Captain Cook Drive has an impressive covering of mature tall Cabbage palms, probably predating Cook's landing. The spring which fed a streamlet rising on the slope above Captain Cook Drive and running out on the beach only stopped flowing in 1992. It had yielded a bucket of water every 25 seconds at peak flow in 1989. This was probably the stream mentioned by Cook. The nearby area of houses and the 95 site caravan park is now sewered to prevent ground water contamination. The road reserve retains its vegetation and the picnic area opposite the shop is shaded and attractive. Murgard's marina and the public boat ramp in the \\"lagoon\\" of the upper reaches of the creek are not intrusive but the approach to the township is messy, despite driving through tall forest along the base of the ridge immediately before entering Seventeen Seventy. The upper reaches of Round Hill Creek are meandering, shallow, mangrove fringed, and backed by tall paperbark forest.

It was built in 1920. It is also known as Hecstanvale. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 September 2001.  History  The soldier settlers house is a high-set, timber building constructed in 1920, on property owned by RS Davies. An ex- serviceman from the First World War, Davies had acquired title to Portion 115 (as it was known) under the Ubobo Soldier Settlement Scheme. In the 1960s, the Davies family purchased Lot 114 (formerly Portion 114), on which another soldier settler's house is located. Non-Indigenous exploration of Boyne Valley area commenced with Captain James Cook in 1770, Matthew Flinders (who named Port Curtis) in 1802 and John Oxley in 1823. More systematic inland exploration in the area had been led from the mid-1840s by Ludwig Leichhardt and Thomas Mitchell. By the early 1850s there were many squatters seeking to take up pastoral properties on the northern frontier of the Burnett District. In June 1853, a government survey party under Francis McCabe was established at the Port Curtis harbour to lay out a township and to initiate a survey of the hinterland in preparation for its development as a pastoral district. When McCabe's labours had resulted in the partial survey of the town, a Government Residency was established at Gladstone in 1854 to oversee civil development in the Port Curtis Pastoral District. Closer settlement in the Boyne Valley and the surrounding district occurred in a number of waves. The first wave was the periodic resumption of the original leasehold runs into smaller leases, which were then let as grazing properties. This was the common pattern from the 1870s through to the end of the First World War. In later years, more intensive settlement occurred with the reduction of the grazing blocks into agricultural and dairy selections. The Port Curtis Dairy Company Ltd (the PCD) was formed at Gladstone in 1904, with its first timber factory buildings erected at Gladstone in 1906. Later developments included the construction of the Gladstone-to-Monto railway line from Byellee to Many Peaks through Ubobo, which opened on 25 July 1910. Along the Boyne River, the major development in the pattern of land use occurred with the creation of the so-called \\"soldier settlements\\" to assist veterans of the First World War. In 1920, the 21-year leases on the pastoral properties of Ubobo, Hybla, Melrose, Degalgil and Cluden expired. When the 1914-1918 war ended the Government sought to compensate those members of the services who were being discharged from the Army, Navy or Air Force, by making available land under the soldier Settlement Schemes. One such scheme was the Ubobo Soldier Settlement Scheme. These areas were resumed by government legislation, leaving a homestead block as an option to the original selectors. The selections were available by perpetual lease, with Agricultural Bank assistance up to approximately $1400 available to develop the property and purchase stock. The Settlement Supervisor was WA Collins. He was later succeeded by ET Wannop. The money provided by the Agricultural Bank as advances on development work, was paid following the inspection of the work, and the endorsement of the payment by the Supervisor. All of the farms were to be used as dairy farms and associated farming. William P (Bill) Spencer, a carpenter at Nagoorin, had a contract to build all the soldier settler houses. The selectors were from every walk of life. There were shop assistants, bank tellers, a plantation manager, drovers, Englishmen, a Scottish champion ploughman and local residents of the Port Curtis District. One of the first properties in the Ubobo area, Portion 115, was taken up by Robert Sydney Davies in 1920. The portion number contained 95 acres. Davies was born in England in 1883, and aged sixteen years, he stowed away in a troopship for South Africa. Once there, Davies joined an Essex Regiment with which he fought during the three years of the Boer War (1899-1901). He remained in the British Army for eight years, serving in India and Burma. In the years preceding the First World War, Davies was a rubber plantation manager for Burns Philp in Choisuel, in the British Solomon Islands. He also oversaw the Japanese pearl divers working for Burns Philp. Davies enlisted in the war on 5 October 1914, joining the Queensland 9th Battalion. The 9th Battalion, which served in the First World War with honour, was the first to leave Queensland and among the first Australian troops to land at Gallipoli on the morning of 25 April 1915. Davies, as a member of a boat carrying twelve men, went ashore ahead of the main force. Some months later, Davies was wounded, losing one of his eyes. He returned to Australia on 5 July 1915. The Ubobo soldier settlement brought back, for a short while, encouragement for the future, which had fallen away with the ending of the mining era, and the closure of the Many Peaks mine. The dairy industry developed, agriculture was encouraged, and much farm land was opened up on which were grown good cotton crops finding employment for cotton pickers. During the 1910s dairying expanded in the surrounding districts, particularly at Mount Larcom and Bracewell, and the Port Curtis Dairy Company (PCD) made steady progress. Following the appointment in January 1916 of Joseph W Rigby as Manager and Secretary, the area from which the Company received cream was extended and the Company's growth was greatly accelerated. In the period 1916 to 1923, suppliers increased from 216 to 502 and manufactured butter from 179 to 539 tons. By the 1920s, the PCD was one of the largest co-operative dairy companies in Queensland. The activities of the PDC at Gladstone and in surrounding districts stimulated the expansion of commercial dairying in Central Queensland. State wide, dairying was an important economic activity for the first half of the 20th century. The township of Ubobo first appears in the Queensland Post Office Directory [Country] in 1926. The majority of those listed in the area are farmers (39 out of 54), including RS Davies. The other listings are for labourers, graziers and stockmen as well as a storekeeper/postmaster and a teacher. There are numerous changes in ownership/tenure over the years in the first ten years of the town appearing in the Directories, seventeen farmers left the area and eleven new names appeared. Later with the years of the depression, falling prices and not being able to meet liability that looked so attractive in the beginning, many others left. While initially providing future prospects, for the most part the soldier settlement schemes were generally disastrous because the resumed land was cut into small, uneconomic blocks, Added to this was the inexperience of most soldier settlers, or an inadequate capital base, and the result was social and economic disaster. At Ubobo, the resumed leases were cut up into fifty-four farms: twenty-seven in the parish of Wietalba and twenty-seven in the parish of Ubobo. Virtually every block was taken up. These fifty-four households (most including children) were expected to make a living as dairy farmers where five families had formerly grazed cattle and in good years make a modest profit and in bad years a loss. Many properties were surrendered by the original selectors, most of whom left the district with a degree of bitterness. Following the Second World War, with the economic depression of the butter section of the dairy industry, the properties were gradually bought by others to amalgamate with their holdings, thus providing a larger and more viable area. Excepting the actual river frontage with the good agricultural land thereabout the settlement has again reverted to its former purpose, the grazing of cattle. RS Davies' property is now occupied by Hector (son of RS Davies and Gloria Davies), who established a modern piggery as well as lucerne growing on the site. The property taken up by RS Davies is the only block still occupied by descendants of the original soldier settler. The Davies family purchased Portion 114 (now Lot 114), in the 1960s. This block, originally taken up by RJ Metten, has a soldier settlers house constructed on the property. It is in a more deteriorated state than the house constructed by RS Davies. When constructed, the soldier settlers house comprised three rooms, a bedroom, a dining room and a kitchen. A verandah opened on the eastern end of the southern side of the building and another verandah on the northern side. At a later date, the verandahs on both sides of the house were enclosed to provide more space. The house is currently unoccupied.  Description  The soldier settler house is a single storey, timber building set on high timber stumps clad with weatherboards. The gable roof building is clad with corrugated galvanised iron. Timber framed, casement windows, with metal window hoods, are located along all elevations of the building. These windows have replaced the original sash windows. Some of the window hoods have star patterns, a common design and occurrence in the buildings constructed in the Boyne Valley. The original staircases located in the northern and southern elevations have been removed. The stove recess in the north-west corner of the building is still extant. Internally, the building comprises three rooms [a bedroom, dining room and a kitchen]. Later, the eastern side of the northern verandah was enclosed and the southern verandah was enclosed to provide for more rooms in the house. A modern water tank is located in the north-western corner near the building. The south-west corner of the undercroft has been enclosed with weatherboards. The verandah on the southern side of the house appears to have been enclosed. Further, it would seem that additions have been constructed on the westerns side in the form of an extension to provide for another room, as well as the enclosing of the verandah on the northern side as well as the addition of a porch and staircase. The house is not in as good condition as the house on Lot 114 and was not inspected internally. A single storey timber building is located to the rear of the house. The building has sash windows, with metal window hoods with a star pattern. The hipped roof is clad with corrugated galvanised iron. The former soldier settlers house is located on a working farm. The house is surrounded by mature vegetation, with views south to the Boyne River.  Heritage listing  Soldier Settler House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 September 2001 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The soldier settlers house is significant for its association with the major redevelopment of the Boyne Valley area, and the establishment of the soldier settlements in the Ubobo area in particular, following the First World War, which led to closer settlement of the area generally. The soldier settlers house is significant as a surviving building remaining on the property on which it was taken up. Significantly, it was taken up by one of the earliest soldier settlers in the area, RS Davies, and is the only remaining property which is still being worked by the descendants of the original soldier settler. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. As a substantially intact, extant structure, located on its original block and associated with the development of the soldier settlement schemes, the soldier settlers house is significant for its rarity. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Designed to a standard government plan, the soldier settlers house is significant as an example of a typical type of construction. Like the majority of soldier settlers' homes, the small, high-set, timber cottage originally comprised a core of four rooms with verandahs opening to both the front and the rear of the building. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The soldier settlers house is significant for its association with those who took up property under the soldier settlement schemes and their descendants, and with their experiences, in the majority of cases, ultimately unsuccessful, with the scheme.

Background  His ancestors - namely his great-grandfather Mahammadhuseyn bek and grandfather Heybet bek arrived from Iran to Baku in 1592 and held various commanding posts. His father Dargahqulu bek was a landlord in Mashtaga who seized the city and killed sultan who was appointed by Safavids, then began to call himself khan, appointing Selim khan as naib of Absheron. He defeated forces of Surkhay khan of Qaziqumuq and later Haji Davud of Shirvan and extended his rule to Shabran and Gobustan. He surrendered castle to Mikhail Matyushkin with 700 soldiers in 1723 and was acknowledged by Russian Empire as local ruler.  Life  He was born in 1727, in Baku. His father ruled at least till 1731.Bakikhanov (2010), pp. 157 However he was charged with treason and relieved of duty in unknown year. He rejoined Nadir Shah and was killed in 1738 in a battle. After Treaty of Ganja, Nadir Shah appointed a certain Galem from Gilan as a sultan of Baku, also awarded Ashur khan Afshar with lands in Absheron peninsula, including Sabunchu, Keshla and Zabrat.Ashurbeyli (1992), p.218 His grandson, son of Malik Muhammad Khan, is named after him. He also acknowledged his grandson Mirza Muhammad as khan at age of 11.  Reign  Taking advantage of Nadir's fall, he seized the city and killed the sultan, appointing former naib Selim khan's grand Muhammed Selim bek as new sultan in 1747.Ashurbeyli, p. 274 His first action was to rebuild navy, as he was also a former admiral of Nadir Shah and chief of shipyard of Langarud.Lerch J.

The Baku Khanate, Baku: √áa≈üƒ±oƒülu, 1999, p.68 Khanates of Karabakh, Shaki, Baku, Salyan and Sultanate of Gabala trying to keep their independence, invaded Shamakhi in alliance, forcing Hajji Muhammad to swear that he won't submit to Afsharids. Hajji Muhammad soon was deposed and replaced by a yuzbashi appointed by Haji Chalabi. Another player in regional politics was adventurer Ahmed khan Shahsevan, a chief of Shahsevan tribe. He urged khans to end Haji Chalabi's supremacy. Mirza Mahammad sided with Ahmed khan, however battle was a disaster and Mirza Muhammad barely escaped with his life. In order to escape newly crowned Shahrukh Afshar's invasion, he sent his ambassador Haji Fehim to Astrakhan, to ask for Russian protection. He later allied to khan of Quba Huseynali khan in 1758. In 1756, he engaged his son to the daughter of Ahmed Khan of Shahsevan. However the Salyan khan Ibrahim khan Rudbar seized her before marriage, taking advantage of the death of Ahmed Khan. Mirza Muhammad Khan decided to fight with the Salyan khan and even made two bridges to cross Kura. We do not have information about the results of this campaign, apparently it did not take place, since in 1757 the crown prince of Guba, Fatali and his army attacked the Salyan khanate, expelled Ibrahim Khan and annexed Salyan to Guba.Iskenderova, p.71 Next year, another threat from Persia - Muhammad Hasan khan landed in Azerbaijan. Mirza Muhammad unsuccessfully tried to establish with Shahverdi khan against him at first, but seeing the odds, sent his Haji Abdul Ali with tributes to Muhammad Hasan. As further precaution, he employed a naval company under leadership of John Elton, now having 3 warship and 3 merchant ships at his disposal. He soon acknowledged suzerainty of Fatali khan of Guba and started to join his military campaigns, such as capturing of Muji castle. He cemented this alliance by marrying his son to Fatali khan's sister, after when he was practically absent from politics. He died on 17 October 1768. His body was taken and buried in Karbala.

It was located at an elevation of 5,832 feet in Mountain Meadow in western Washington County, Utah, United States. History Jacob Hamblin started a ranch and built a house for his family in 1856 overlooking Mountain Meadow soon after the building of the 1855 Leach Cutoff of the Mormon Road, a wagon road that passed from Mountain Meadow to Pinto, through Leach Canyon to Cedar City was built nearby. This saved 15 miles from the older route from Cedar City through Iron Springs, Antelope Springs, Pinto Creek (at modern Newcastle, Utah), to the north end of Mountain Meadow, in Holt Canyon. Other settlers soon came to ranch or farm, forming a settlement with homes that were built along a street with the church and school at the far end. It was called Fort Hamblin, later shortened to Hamblin. Drinking water for the town came from Hamblin Spring, a clear spring near the village at . Farms were irrigated springs in the Meadow. These settlers sold food and supplies to drovers of herds using the meadow, and immigrants, and teamsters passing along the wagon road. At the time of the 1857 Mountain Meadows Massacre, the seventeen children who survived, were brought to the town and were cared for there before they were returned to their relatives in Arkansas. In 1869, Jacob Hamblin received a call from Brigham Young to establish an Indian mission at Fort Kanab and left with his family. After the railroads came to Utah in 1869 the Mormon Road ceased to be a major thoroughfare and Hamblin became a backwater. Over the decades since 1847 when the wagon road was established, the 16 mile long, lush spring fed meadow Fremont described was overgrazed by the passing herds, pack and wagon teams, causing increasing floods and consequent erosion, that also lowered the water table and dried up the springs that watered the meadow. Eventually this caused the people of Hamblin to relocate, many going to Enterprise, and the site became mostly deserted by 1890.John W.

Materials she used in her concoctions included nails, earthworms, coffee grounds, chicken feathers, red pepper, and beef tongue. The instructions for her \\"To Kill Someone: Formula I\\" were to kill a rattlesnake and hang it out to dry in the sun. Then the person's name was written on a piece of paper and placed in the snake's mouth. Jackson was feared by the brothel madams of Storyville for her \\"sealing power\\". By 1946, Jackson had purchased half of the property on her block. She also owned a car and traveled extensively in the country. New Orleans musician Dr. John mentioned Jackson in his song \\"Jump Sturdy\\" on his 1968 album Gris-Gris. In the song he says that Jump Sturdy got tangled up with Queen Julia Jackson and died after Jackson \\"dropped a Zozo la Brique\\". Jackson confronted him backstage in 1972 and told him that what he had said about her in his song was \\"a goddamned lie.\\" Literary figure Ishmael Reed recognized Jackson as a theoretician of Neo-Hoodoo for her role in stripping Hoodoo of its oppressive Catholic influences.

Nanzo-in temple was originally located on Mt. Koyasan, but local anti-Buddhist authorities threatened to destroy the temple in 1886. Public outcry lead to a decade-long effort to have the temple transferred to Sasaguri. It was moved in 1899, under the leadership of Sasaguri priest, Hayashi Satoshiun. Nanzo-in temple is the main location among the 88 temples that make up the Sasaguri pilgrimage route, one of the three famous walking pilgrimages in Japan. Today, the temple and its surrounding grounds receive more than 1 million visitors annually. Lottery A chief priest of Nanzo-in temple once won the lottery after laying his ticket next to a statue of Daikoku. The temple claims that others who have made a similar effort have also won the lottery, bringing the temple associations with luck and lottery tickets. Reclining Buddha The reclining Buddha statue, known as either Nehanzo or Shaka Nehan (\\"Nirvana\\") is 41 meters long, 11 meters high, and weighs nearly 300 tons. The statue depicts Buddha at the moment of death, or entrance into nirvana. The interior holds ashes of Buddha and two Buddhist adherents, Ananda and Maudgalyayana. Those relics were a gift from Myanmar as thanks for the sect's donations of medical supplies to children in both Nepal and Myanmar. In 1995, 1,300 monks from Myanmar and Nepal attended the unveiling of the reclining Buddha statue. Inside the sculpture, sand from each of the 88 shrines that make up the Shikoku pilgrimage are stored below bricks within a narrow hallway. Every year, hundreds of Buddhists come together to clean the statue using bamboo leaves tied to five-meter poles.

Less than two weeks after the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Swiss government started studying the possibility of building nuclear weapons, and continued its military nuclear program for 43 years until 1988. It has since signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Switzerland never possessed biological weapons, but did have a program of the Swiss Army high command to develop and test chemical weapons.  Military nuclear program  Paul Scherrer in the late 1940s. He played an important role in the Swiss nuclear program. On 15 August 1945, Hans Frick, a colonel in the Swiss military, sent a letter to Federal Councillor Karl Kobelt requesting that Switzerland study the possibility of acquiring nuclear weapons in order to defend itself. The Federal Council authorized the creation of a commission to do such in November 1945. Efforts \\"were well under way\\" in 1945. On 8 June 1946, the Study Commission for Nuclear Energy ( ‚Äì SKA) was created by the Swiss government under the leadership of Dr. Paul Scherrer, a physicist and professor at ETH Zurich. The commission had the objective of studying the civil use of atomic energy and the secret objective of studying the scientific and technical basis for building nuclear weapons. The activity of this group was low and only slow progress was made; however the events of the Cold War, especially the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 and the nuclear arms race of the mid-1950s, provided new impetus. While his specific role is questioned, Scherrer played an important role in the Swiss nuclear program. The secret Study Commission for the Possible Acquisition of Own Nuclear Arms was instituted by Chief of General Staff Louis de Montmollin with a meeting on 29 March 1957. The aim of the commission was to give the Swiss Federal Council an orientation towards \\"the possibility of the acquisition of nuclear arms in Switzerland.\\" The recommendations of the commission were ultimately favorable. The Federal Council released a public statement on 11 July 1958 stating that although a world without nuclear weapons was in Switzerland's interest, its neighboring countries adopting nuclear weapons would force it to do likewise. On 23 December 1958 the Federal Council instructed the Military Department to study the logistics and execution of attaining nuclear arms. However, efforts remained focused on study and planning rather than implementation. In a referendum held in April 1962, the Swiss people rejected a proposal to ban nuclear weapons within the country. The next year in May, Swiss voters again rejected a referendum that would have required Swiss voters to approve of the Armed Forces being equipped in nuclear weapons if it chose to do so. By 1963, planning had proceeded to the point that detailed technical proposals, specific arsenals, and cost estimates were made. On 15 November 1963, Dr. Paul Schmid prepared a 58-page report laying the theoretical foundations for Swiss nuclear armaments. On 28 November 1963, the Deputy Chief of the General Staff estimated that the costs of building a uranium bomb at 720 million Swiss francs over 35 years, initially including 20 million francs for pure research, that would be needed for planning. It also calculated that, should the decision be for plutonium instead of highly enriched uranium, then the estimate would be 2,100 million francs over 27 years. On 4 May 1964, the military joint staff issued a recommendation to have about 100 bombs (60‚Äì100 kilotons), 50 artillery shells (5 kt), and 100 rockets (100 kt) within the next 15 years, at costs of about 750 million Swiss francs. There were plans for 7 underground nuclear tests in \\"uninhabited regions\\" of Switzerland ‚Äì a location with a radius of \\"that can be sealed off completely.\\" In addition to this, Switzerland purchased uranium and stored it in nuclear reactors purchased from the United States, the first of which was built in 1960. Between 1953 and 1955, Switzerland procured around of enriched uranium from the Belgian Congo with the authorization of the U.S. and United Kingdom (Switzerland had also considered purchasing from the Republic of China and the Union of South Africa). were stored in the Diorit reactor in W√ºrenlingen, while a stockpile of of uranium and of uranium oxide was stored at Wimmis until 1981, and it was not covered by the international safeguards meant to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. Additionally, in 1969, the Swiss government unsuccessfully tried to purchase of weapons-grade plutonium from Norway. In the spring of 1964, a group working within the Military Department, which approved of nuclear tests in Switzerland, presented a secret plan for the attainment of nuclear weapons to the Federal Council. In the first phase of the plan, 50 bombs from 60‚Äì100 kt would be procured. In phase two, another 200 bombs would be procured. To clarify definitively whether nuclear tests should be carried out in Switzerland, the military chief of staff Jacob Annasohn requested of Federal Councillor Paul Chaudet, head of the Military Department, to obtain authorization for the total budget of 20 million Swiss francs from the Federal Council. A Swiss Mirage IIIS in 1988. Besides having a main military goal of deterrence, strategists envisioned the Swiss nuclear strike capability as part of a preemptive war against the Soviet Union. The Swiss Air Force Mirage III jet would have been able to carry nuclear bombs as far as Moscow. They also suggested the weapons could be used on Swiss soil against a possible invading force. Switzerland possessed of separated plutonium coming from reprocessed spent fuel of the heavy water research reactor DIORIT. It was stored for several decades under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards at the Paul Scherrer Institute, but this supply was not directly suitable for building nuclear weapons. In February 2016, nearly three decades after the end of its nuclear program and in time for the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit, the Swiss government shipped this excess plutonium to the United States for disposal. Financial problems with the defense budget in 1964 prevented the substantial sums required from being allocated. Continuing financial short-falls prevented the proposed effort from getting off the ground. This, as well as a serious accident in 1969 which caused a partial meltdown in the small Lucens pilot reactor, strengthened opposition against the Swiss nuclear program. Switzerland signed the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NTP) on 27 November 1969, and its process of ratification first met with the resistance of the Federal Department of Defense. After signing the treaty, Switzerland's policy of pursuing acquiring nuclear weapons was replaced by one of studying acquisition to provide options in case the treaty broke down. Switzerland ratified the treaty on 9 March 1977. Soon after that, Switzerland ratified the Seabed Arms Control Treaty. On 30 April 1969, the Working Committee for Nuclear Issues (AAA) was created. It met 27 times between 26 September 1969 and 25 October 1988. However, the committee had only a preparatory role. As the Cold War started coming to an end, the AAA became less relevant. On 1 November 1988, Federal Councillor Arnold Koller signed the dissolution order, and the AAA ceased to exist on 31 December of that year, thus ending the 43-year Swiss nuclear weapons program. Nuclear weapons ban On July 7, 2017, Switzerland voted in favor of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the first such international treaty to ban nuclear weapons. However, in 2018, the Swiss government changed its position and opposed signing the treaty because of security concerns.  Biological and chemical weapons  Switzerland did not possess biological weapons, nor did they see it as in their interest to acquire them. Thus the banning of such weapons was in the country's interest. Switzerland signed the Biological Weapons Convention in April 1972 and ratified the treaty in 1976 with three reservations. The country also signed the Chemical Weapons Convention in January 1993 and ratified it in March 1995. In 1937, General Henri Guisan and the Swiss Army high command commissioned a secret program to develop and utilize chemical weapons. From 1939 onwards, the contact poison sulfur mustard was manufactured, as well as phenacyl chloride.http://www.hls- dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D43555.php In the summer of 1940, extensive exercises were held in several cantons using mortars with polychlorinated naphthalene gas. In the Canton of Uri alone, 14,000 farm cows were poisoned, which the Swiss Army then euthanized. The program also produced 330 tons of mustard gas, which proved difficult to store and thus the program was halted in 1943 by General Guisan, who ordered the chemical weapons to be burned on the grounds of the Munitionsfabrik Altdorf, known today as RUAG Ammotec.

Through his work with the United States Department of State, he offered advice and insight to several countries across the globe as they rewrote some or all of their legal codes. Early Years and Education Hall was born in 1901 and grew up in Chicago, Illinois. He studied at the University of Chicago and was a Fulbright scholar, earning both his bachelor's in philosophy and his law degrees. He graduated from law school with honors in 1923.\\"Citation: Jerome Hall,\\" 35 N.D. L. Rev. 89 (1959). Career Hall became a member of the Illinois Bar in 1923, and began his legal career practicing corporate law in Chicago from 1923 to 1929. Even during this early stage of his career, the allure of teaching manifested itself, and he began teaching classes in public speaking and business law at the Indiana University Extension (now IU Northwest) in Gary, Indiana.Dorothy Mackay-Collins. \\"Oral History with Professor Jerome Hall.\\" University of California Hastings College of the Law (June 17, 1987). These early teaching experiences fostered a love of teaching, and in 1929, he left his legal practice behind to teach full time, beginning at the University of North Dakota from 1929 to 1932.Mackay- Collins at 9.

He next moved to Louisiana State University and taught as a professor of law from 1935-1939, before moving to Indiana. Hall spent the majority of his professional career as a professor of law at Indiana University Bloomington from 1939 to 1970. Upon retiring at 65, he was invited to join the esteemed Sixty-Five Club at University of California, Hastings College of the Law, where he continued to teach until 1986.Mackay-Collins at 17. Scholarship Hall was a renowned scholar in comparative law, criminal law, and jurisprudence. He was among the first scholars to analyze legal problems through an interdisciplinary approach. He published his first book, Theft, Law and Society, in 1935; even then his interdisciplinary approach to legal analysis could be seen: \\"One great effect is and will be the fact that it stimulates one's thinking along all the allied fields‚Ä¶. The author realizes that crime is behavior. If those who defend individualization of punishment and those who are sceptical [sic] of all individualization of punishment will read this chapter, I think that there will be much more sense displayed in the writing and the talking on this subject.\\"Paul J. Mundle. \\"Book Review: Theft, Law and Society, By Jerome Hall.\\" 19 Marq. L. Rev. 146 (1935). In one of his best known works, General Principles of Criminal Law, Hall developed a single concept of mens rea,Livingston Hall. \\"Review: General Principles of Criminal Law, by Jerome Hall.\\" 60 Harv.

His writings on criminal law theory became well known among scholars. \\"Professor Hall has added another book to his already long list of distinguished publications. [Studies in Jurisprudence and Criminal Theory] is not a self-contained segment of work, but, rather, a cross section of works, and not just of any scholar, but of an unusually original thinker.

Mueller. \\"Criminal Theory: An Appraisal of Jerome Hall's Studies in Jurisprudence and Criminal Theory.\\" 34 Ind. L. Rev. 206 (1958-59). Late in his career, Hall's research interests shifted to a focus on law and religion, and he became involved with the Harvard Divinity School and Berkeley's Pacific School of Religion, speaking and writing on the topic; through this new interest, he was asked to be a founding member of the Association of American Law Schools' Section on Law and Religion, and was the first director of the Council on Religion and Law, a non-profit organization that came out of a series of discussions and conferences at Harvard in the 1970s.Mackay-Collins at 96. A full bibliography of his written works can be found on the Jerome Hall Law Library website. Professional Contributions Hall made significant contributions to the global legal community throughout his career. He was an active member of several professional organizations, including serving as chairman and editor of the Modern Legal Philosophy Series from 1940 to 1956,Mackay-Collins at 30. and holding simultaneous presidencies of both the American Society for Political and Legal Philosophy and the American section of the International Association for Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy, 1965-66.\\"Jerome Hall, 1901-1992.\\" Hastings Community (Summer 1992).

He spent seven weeks in Korea, then went to Japan for another six weeks, and was then asked to continue on to India for another six weeks, culminating in the Philippines for an additional week. He was named honorary director of the Korean Law Institute in 1955. The State Department came to him a second time in 1968 and asked him to lecture across Asia as a \\"leader specialist\\" in the US State Department's Exchange Program. He advised India on the rewriting of the country's criminal code during this trip. Hall's international lectureship did not end with his involvement with the US Department of State. He has held several prestigious lecturer positions at universities across the globe, including a Fulbright Scholar position at the University of London and Queen's University in Belfast from 1954‚Äì55; a Ford Foundation lectureship in 1960 that sent him to Mexico and several countries in South America; a second Fulbright Scholar position in 1961 at Freiburg University; and a Rockefeller Foundation grant to study and lecture on comparative law in Western Europe from 1961 to 1962.

He has publicly claimed to be the main part of the team that created bitcoin, and the identity behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. These claims are regarded as false by much of the media and the cryptocurrency community.  Early life and education  Wright graduated from high school in 1987 from Padua College in Brisbane. Wright was an adjunct academic and researcher at Charles Sturt University, where he was working on his PhD entitled \\"The quantification of information systems risk\\". Wright says he has a doctorate in theology, comparative religious and classical studies, awarded in 2003, although he has not stated which institution granted this doctorate. Wright claimed to have a PhD in computer science from Charles Sturt University on his LinkedIn profile as of 2015; but the university told Forbes that it only awarded him two master's degrees and not a doctorate. Wright's PhD from CSU was finally awarded in February 2017. Wright has written or co-written several books. Wright has been a trustee of the Uniting Church in New South Wales.  Career and businesses  Wright worked in information technology for various companies, including OzEmail, K-Mart and the Australian Securities Exchange, as well as working as a security consultant for Mahindra & Mahindra. He claims to have designed the architecture for possibly the world's first online casino, Lasseter's Online (based in Alice Springs, Northern Territory), which went online in 1999. He was the information systems manager for the accounting firm BDO Kendalls. In 2004, Wright was convicted of contempt of court by the Supreme Court of New South Wales. He was sentenced to 28 days in jail for breaching an injunction that prevented him from approaching customers of DeMorgan Information Security Systems, from which he resigned in 2003. The sentence was suspended on condition of performing 250 hours of community service. After appealing the decision, the ruling was upheld in 2005 and also in a subsequent appeal to the High Court of Australia in 2006. Wright was the CEO of the technology firm Hotwire Preemptive Intelligence Group (Hotwire PE), which planned to launch Denariuz Bank, the world's first bitcoin-based bank, though it encountered regulatory difficulties with the Australian Tax Office and failed in 2014. Wright is the founder of cryptocurrency company DeMorgan Ltd., which claimed to receive $54 million AUD in tax incentives via AusIndustry. Bitcoin In December 2015, two parallel investigations by Wired and Gizmodo suggested that Wright may have been the inventor of bitcoin. Subsequent reporting, however, raised concerns that Wright was engaged in an elaborate hoax. Hours after Wired published their allegations, Wright's home in Gordon, New South Wales and associated business premises in Ryde, New South Wales were raided by the Australian Federal Police. According to the AFP, the raid was part of an Australian Tax Office investigation. On 2 May 2016, the BBC and The Economist published articles claiming that Wright had digitally signed messages using cryptographic keys created during the early days of bitcoin's development. The keys are inextricably linked to blocks of bitcoins known to have been created or \\"mined\\" by Satoshi Nakamoto. The same day a blog post on the website www.drcraigwright.net associated Wright with Satoshi and posted a message with a cryptographic signature attached. Security researcher Dan Kaminsky said in his blog that Wright's claim was a scam and bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik agreed that evidence publicly provided by Wright does not prove anything. Jordan Pearson and Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai said that, \\"Wright simply reused an old signature from a bitcoin transaction performed in 2009 by Satoshi.\\" Earlier in an interview with the BBC, Wright had promised to give \\"extraordinary proof to an extraordinary claim.\\" He has yet to provide any verifiable evidence of his authorship of the original Satoshi whitepaper or collaboration with known early developers and refuses, or is unable, to provide the one piece of evidence which would prove his claim, the original Satoshi Nakamoto GPG private key. On Thursday, 5 May 2016, shortly before closing his blog, Wright sent around an email link to a news story site saying \\"Craig Wright faces criminal charges and serious jail time in UK\\". Wright stated that \\"I am the source of terrorist funds as bitcoin creator or I am a fraud to the world. At least a fraud is able to see his family. There is nothing I can do.\\" The article Wright mentioned to O'Hagan has since been retracted. In June 2016, the London Review of Books published an article by Andrew O'Hagan about the events, later included in his book The Secret Life: Three True Stories, in which O'Hagan spends several weeks with Wright at the request of Wright's public relations team; which, as revealed in the book, was set up as a result of a business deal between Wright and various individuals including Calvin Ayre. O'Hagan was with Wright during the time of his various media interviews. O'Hagan also interviews Wright's wife, colleagues and many of the other people involved in his claims. Wright claimed to O'Hagan that he had provided an invalid private key because he was unable to provide the valid one, as a result of legal obligations agreed as part of a previous Seychelles trust deal. Wright told Finder in 2019 that bitcoin's creation was a group effort, that he drove the project, and that Dave Kleiman and Hal Finney were involved. Wright registered US copyright in the bitcoin white paper and the code for Bitcoin 0.1 in April 2019. A spokesman for Wright told the Financial Times that this was \\"the first government agency recognition of Craig Wright as Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin\\"; the United States Copyright Office issued a press release clarifying that this was not the case, and that \\"the Copyright Office does not investigate whether there is a provable connection between the claimant and the pseudonymous author.\\" Legal issues Dave Kleiman estate In February 2018 the estate of Dave Kleiman initiated a lawsuit at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Wright over the rights to worth of bitcoin claiming that Wright defrauded Kleiman of bitcoins and intellectual property rights. In August 2019, Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart, ruling on a motion to force Wright to list his early bitcoin holdings, ordered that, for the purposes of this case, the Kleiman estate owned half the bitcoin holdings that Wright mined in partnership with Kleiman from 2009‚Äì2013, as Wright's \\"non-compliance with the court's orders is willful and in bad faith.\\" Wright was also ordered to transfer half of the partnership's intellectual property, and pay Kleiman's reasonable attorney fees in bringing the motion. Reinhart said that the court was not required to decide, and would not decide, whether Wright was Satoshi Nakamoto, and was not required to decide and did not decide how much bitcoin Wright controlled. Reinhart said that \\"Dr. Wright's demeanor did not impress me as someone who was telling the truth\\" and that he rejected Wright's testimony in the motion: \\"Dr. Wright‚Äôs story not only was not supported by other evidence in the record, it defies common sense and real- life experience.\\" Defamation cases In May 2019, Wright started using UK libel law to sue people who denied he was the inventor of bitcoin, and who called him a fraud. Wright also served legal notices to Vitalik Buterin, the founder of the cryptocurrency Ethereum, who called Wright a fraud; Roger Ver, an early bitcoin entrepreneur and advocate; and Peter McCormack, a podcaster.

The uniqueness was proven in 2013. The statement arose from work on the foundations of quantum mechanics done by Paul Dirac in the 1940s and was formalized in 1959 by Richard Kadison and Isadore Singer. The problem was subsequently shown to be equivalent to numerous open problems in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, engineering and computer science. Kadison, Singer, and most later authors believed the statement to be false, but, in 2013, it was proven true by Adam Marcus, Daniel Spielman and Nikhil Srivastava, who received the 2014 P√≥lya Prize for the achievement. The solution was made possible by a reformulation provided by Joel Anderson, who showed in 1979 that his \\"paving conjecture\\", which only involves operators on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, is equivalent to the Kadison‚ÄìSinger problem. Nik Weaver provided another reformulation in a finite- dimensional setting, and this version was proved true using random polynomials. Original formulation Consider the separable Hilbert space ‚Ñì2 and two related C*-algebras: the algebra B of all continuous linear operators from ‚Ñì2 to ‚Ñì2, and the algebra D of all diagonal continuous linear operators from ‚Ñì2 to ‚Ñì2. A state on a C*-algebra A is a continuous linear functional \\\\varphi:A\\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} such that \\\\varphi(I)=1 (where I denotes the algebra's multiplicative identity) and \\\\varphi(T)\\\\ge 0 for every T\\\\ge 0. Such a state is called pure if it is an extremal point in the set of all states on A (i.e. if it cannot be written as a convex combination of other states on A). By the Hahn-Banach theorem, any functional on D can be extended to B. Kadison and Singer conjectured that, for the case of pure states, this extension is unique. That is, the Kadison‚ÄìSinger problem consisted in proving or disproving the following statement: :to every pure state \\\\varphi on D there exists a unique state on B that extends \\\\varphi. This claim is in fact true. Paving conjecture reformulation The Kadison‚ÄìSinger problem has a positive solution if and only if the following \\"paving conjecture\\" is true: :For every \\\\varepsilon>0 there exists a natural number k so that the following holds: for every n and every linear operator T on the n-dimensional Hilbert space \\\\mathbb{C}^n with zeros on the diagonal there exists a partition of \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\} into k sets A_1,\\\\dots, A_k such that ::\\\\|P_{A_j} T P_{A_j}\\\\\\\\le \\\\varepsilon \\\\|T\\\\\\\\text{ for } j=1,\\\\ldots,k. Here P_{A_j} denotes the orthogonal projection on the space spanned by the standard unit vectors corresponding to the elements so that the matrix of P_{A_j} T P_{A_j} is obtained from the matrix of T by replacing all rows and columns that don't correspond to the indices in A_j The matrix norm \\\\|\\\\cdot\\\\is the spectral norm, i.e. the operator norm with respect to the Euclidean norm Note that in this statement, k may only depend on \\\\varepsilon, not Equivalent discrepancy statement The following \\"discrepancy\\" statement, again equivalent to the Kadison‚ÄìSinger problem because of previous work by Nik Weaver, was proven by Marcus/Spielman/Srivastava using a technique of random polynomials: :Suppose vectors u_1,\\\\ldots,u_m\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}^d are given with \\\\sum_{i=1}^m u_i u_i^* = I (the d\\\\times d identity matrix) and \\\\|u_i\\\\|_2^2\\\\le\\\\delta for Then there exists a partition of \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,m\\\\\\\\} into two sets S_1 and S_2 such that ::\\\\left\\\\|\\\\sum_{i\\\\in S_j} u_i u_i^*\\\\right\\\\|\\\\le \\\\frac{\\\\left(1+\\\\sqrt{2\\\\delta}\\\\right)^2}{2} \\\\text{ for }j=1,2. This statement implies the following: :Suppose vectors v_1,\\\\ldots,v_m\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^d are given with \\\\|v_i\\\\|_2^2\\\\le\\\\alpha for and ::\\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\langle v_i,x\\\\rangle^2 =1 \\\\ \\\\text{ for all }x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^d \\\\text{ with } \\\\|x\\\\|=1. :Then there exists a partition of \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,m\\\\\\\\} into two sets S_1 and S_2 such that, for j=1,2: ::\\\\left|\\\\sum_{i\\\\in S_j} \\\\langle v_i,x\\\\rangle^2 -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right|\\\\le 5\\\\sqrt{\\\\alpha} \\\\ \\\\text{ for all } x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^d \\\\text{ with } \\\\|x\\\\|=1 . Here the \\"discrepancy\\" becomes visible when Œ± is small enough: the quadratic form on the unit sphere can be split into two roughly equal pieces, i.e. pieces whose values don't differ much from 1/2 on the unit sphere. In this form, the theorem can be used to derive statements about certain partitions of graphs.

Education and early career Strangeways was born Thomas Strangeways Pigg in 1866. Strangeways studied under Alfredo Kanthack at St Bartholomew's Hospital and received his medical degree in 1890. He followed Kanthack to the University of Cambridge after Kanthack was offered the chair of the Pathology Department there. Strangeways became a demonstrator and subsequently a lecturer in pathology at the University of Cambridge. Founding of Cambridge Research Hospital A page of notes from a Research Hospital notebook dated 1921, believed to have been written by Strangeways. Strangeways developed an interest in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis and in 1905 founded the Cambridge Research Hospital in order to study patients suffering from this and related conditions. Funded largely by Strangeways himself, noted doctors of his acquaintance, and donations from patients, the hospital began modestly with only six beds, and with research equipment located in renovated coal sheds. It closed briefly in 1908 due to lack of funding, but quickly reopened and moved to its current site in 1912 thanks to the support of Otto Beit and to its temporary repurposing as a hospital for military officers in World War I. The hospital returned to its research purpose in 1917. Later, in 1923, the clinical aspects of the laboratory's work were moved back to St Bartholomew's Hospital so that the laboratory could focus on then-newly developing technologies in tissue culture and cell biology. Having learned about tissue culture techniques from Alexis Carrel, Strangeways took great interest in the new field, including developing demonstrations of the technique for his lectures. After University of Edinburgh zoology student Honor Fell spent a summer working with him, he hired her as a research assistant; she would take over leadership of the laboratory following Strangeways' death in 1926. In the 1920s and 30s, the laboratory was the only British institution focused specifically on tissue culture technique, the utility of which was a controversial topic among scientists of the time. Personal life Strangeways became engaged to Dorothy Beck in 1901 and the couple married in 1902. As of the construction of the new hospital building in 1912, they had two children. Strangeways financed his laboratory out of his own earnings for most of his life, although he was not personally wealthy; a later director of the laboratory, John Dingle, wrote in a retrospective that \\"there is little doubt that his family suffered financially\\" from his investments, although Dorothy was consistently supportive of the project. Strangeways died unexpectedly of a brain haemorrhage in 1926.

Kerr is the Dimitri V. D'Arbeloff - MBA Class of 1955 Professor of Business Administration professor at Harvard Business School, where he is a co-director of Harvard's Managing the Future of Work project and faculty chair of the Launching New Ventures program for executive education. Kerr‚Äôs research focuses on how businesses and economies grow, typically through connections to innovation, entrepreneurship, and globalization. His publications have looked at global ventures, immigration, and talent clusters. He wrote The Gift of Global Talent, a book arguing global talent flows are fundamentally reshaping business and society, and that American policies toward high-skilled immigration like H-1B need substantial reform.Ibid. Kerr has publicly made similar arguments before, such as a public statement in support of the International Entrepreneur Rule. Other contributions to the field of economics that Kerr has made revolve around innovation and growth theory. Kerr‚Äôs work has been featured and referenced across a range of publications, including Bloomberg, the Harvard Business Review, the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and the Atlantic. Additionally, Kerr has served as an advisor or consultant to a number of companies around the world.  Harvard Business School's Project on Managing the Future of Work  In 2017, Kerr co-founded Harvard Business School‚Äôs Project on Managing the Future of Work with fellow Harvard Business School professor Joseph B. Fuller. The project identifies and researches six forces that are ‚Äúredefining the nature of work in the United States as well as in many other advanced and emerging economies.‚Äù The project lists the six forces as ‚ÄúTechnology trends like automation and artificial intelligence; Contingent workforces and the gig economy; Workforce demographics and the ‚Äúcare economy‚Äù; The middle-skills gap and worker investments; Global talent access and utilization; Spatial tensions between leading urban centers and rural areas.‚Äù In June, 2018, the project launched a podcast series called ‚ÄúManaging the Future of Work‚Äù that discusses these six forces with business, political, and community leaders. Additionally, Kerr and Fuller announced in June, 2018, that they will be teaching a course in the fall of 2018 as part of Harvard Business School‚Äôs Executive Education program.  Other Notable Academic Contributions  Kerr coauthored a paper with William Lincoln in 2010 that argued that increased in high-skilled immigration boosted American innovation. This paper was later the winner of the H. Gregg Lewis Prize for Best Paper in Journal of Labor Economics 2010-2011. Kerr cowrote a 2015 paper with Martin Mandorff which analyzes tendencies among members of ethnic groups in the U.S. to gravitate towards specific professions, examples given include Yemeni immigrants being 75 times more likely than others to own grocery stores, and Koreans being 34 times more likely to operate dry cleaners. Kerr collaborated on a 2015 paper with Daron Acemoglu and Ufuk Akcigit which updated the real business-cycle theory. In 2013, Kerr received the Ewing Marion Kauffman award for \\"Distinguished Research in Entrepreneurship\\". Personal life Kerr grew up in Alabama and attended the University of Virginia. In the 1990s, he worked in the telecom and emerging internet industries, living in Hong Kong. Upon graduating from MIT Economics with a Ph.D. in 2005, Kerr joined Harvard Business School as a tenure-track Assistant Professor and held a number of teaching assignments and produced academic publications that culminated with his eventual promotion to professor with tenure in 2014. Kerr is married to Sari Pekkala Kerr, who is an economist and senior research at the Wellesley Centers for Women. Originally from Finland, Sari Pekkala Kerr studies the economics of labor markets, education, and family.Ibid. They live together in Lexington, Massachusetts with their two children.

Background  Kim Dal-sam (born Yi Songjin) was born in 1923 and grew up in Jeju Province, Korea. During Japanese occupation, Kim spent time in Osaka, Japan before moving to Tokyo to study mathematics at Chuo University (Tokyo Central University). During World War II, Kim was conscripted by the Japanese government to work for the Hakbyeong shipbuilding company. In January 1945, Kim married the daughter of a man named Gangmunseok Gangyoungae. After World War II, Kim taught Marxism-Leninism at a middle school in Jeju Province. He also became quite active in politics, serving as an organizer and director for the Workers Party of South Korea (WPSK) in the late 1940s. Kim was an outspoken critic of Koreans who collaborated with the Japanese during occupation and often protested against the government police force on Jeju, demanding unification with the North. Kim was vehemently opposed to the elections planned for May 10, 1948 by the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea (UNTCOK) because he thought they would further reinforce Korean division. In order to prevent these elections from happening, Kim led an armed rebellion against the government police forces on the island on April 3, 1948, which became known as the Jeju Uprising.  Role in the Jeju Uprising  As a leader in the Military Committee of the WPSK Jeju branch, Kim, along with Cho No-gu, planned the April 3, 1948 attacks on government police forces one month prior, in March, 1948. When the uprising commenced, Kim‚Äôs forces included 400 guerilla fighters and 4,000 members of ‚Äúself-defense‚Äù groups located throughout the island. On April 28, 1948, the fighting on Jeju stopped as Kim Dal-sam met with the leader of the police forces on the island, Kim Ik-ryeol, to negotiate a truce. Kim Dal-sam‚Äôs demands included ‚Äúthe surrender of all police forces, the confiscation of all weapons, punishment of police and rightists who had committed atrocities, withdrawal of rightist youth groups, and assurances that the May 10 elections would be cancelled.‚Äù Kim Ik-ryeol refused to accept Kim Dal-sam‚Äôs demands and hostilities started again three days later. In August 1948, with the uprising in full-swing, Kim left Jeju to attend a conference of the Korean Communist party (KCP) on the border town of Haeju, North Korea. At the conference, Kim reported on the positive developments on Jeju, to which the other participants responded with ‚Äúthunderous applause.‚Äù It was at this same conference that KCP and Soviet Union officials held elections to establish the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Kim returned to Jeju in early to mid-September.  After the Jeju Uprising and death  After Republic of Korea (ROK) forces crushed the Jeju Uprising in March, 1949, Kim left Jeju for mainland Korea in order to enter DPRK. On March 20, 1950, Kim's body was found among the dead in the aftermath of a guerrilla battle at Jeongseon County, before full-scale Korean war began.

She died in February 2009 at the age of 78.  Career  At Lund, Gertrud Dahlgren pursued studies in systematic botany. Henning Weimarck, who held the chair in Systematic Botany, had initiated a new line of research in the mid-1950s, the field of biosystematics, which was to become Gertrud Dahlgren's chosen field, and to receive international attention. She achieved her Ph.D. in 1967 for her work on the genus Sanguisorba, and in particular two Swedish species, S. officinalis and S. minor. She was appointed to the position of Associate professor at Lund, and continued her work in biostematics, with especial interest in Ranunculus and Erodium, and editing a textbook on systematic botany, which was later translated into German. In 1979 she was appointed head of the department of Systematic Botany at Lund, a position she held till 1987 when, following the death of her husband, she turned to continuing his work on angiosperm taxonomy.

(see 1967 in music). It is the only composition recorded by the Monkees that is credited to all its members, and managed to bubble under the Billboard Hot 100 upon its distribution. According to interviews with various members of the band, the song was inspired by Mose Allison's Parchman Farm. Michael Nesmith explains, ‚ÄúPeter had always loved to jam on ‚ÄòParchman Farm‚Äô and started off on this thing. We just headed off into la-la land. Then Micky started riffing this thing over the top of it.‚Äù Peter Tork continues, ‚ÄúSomebody gave me an arrangement of ‚ÄòParchman Farm‚Äô that a friend of theirs had sort of generated ‚Äì the real folk process at work. I had played that version around for a while amongst the guys. I don‚Äôt remember why we started playing it that day, but we just jammed it unrehearsed.‚Äù Micky Dolenz concludes, \\"It was the exact same song, and we were covering it basically. So we did the tracks, and it came out real good. I remember Mike saying, ‚ÄòAll it is is the chord progression; we‚Äôre not going to steal the melody or anything. Let‚Äôs use this track but write other words, another melody to it. Why should we just cover somebody else‚Äôs tune?‚Äô So I said, ‚ÄòOK, fine. Good idea.‚Äô‚Äù Diane Hildebrand's lyrics to \\"Goin' Down\\" describe a man whose relationship has ended, and he attempts to \\"end it all\\" by drunkenly leaping into the river to be dragged away by the current. He immediately regrets the decision and comes to a self-realization before coming to shore in New Orleans to partake in its \\"swingin' scenes\\". Micky Dolenz explains, \\"Diane Hildebrand was given the track, and she was told to go away and write a song. She came back with this song, and I started practicing it. Singing it like this (adopts slow tempo). She said, ‚ÄòNo, no. It‚Äôs twice that fast.‚Äô I was doing it half- time. I remember that I said, ‚ÄòWhat?!‚Äô She said, ‚ÄòYes, it‚Äôs twice that fast.‚Äô I get a lot of comments about that tune. (On the TV show) I did that live. You don‚Äôt see nobody doing that stuff these days, do ya?‚Äù The song's energetic, rapid lead vocals by Micky Dolenz, and big band influences that are melded into the pop song, with the arrangements organized by jazz musician Shorty Rogers. With \\"Daydream Believer\\", as the song's A-side, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100, \\"Goin' Down\\" managed to chart at number 104 nationally. Since its release, the composition has become a staple of the Monkees' touring setlists, with a live version of the song appearing on the album 2001: Live in Las Vegas. An extended rendition of \\"Goin' Down\\" also appears on the deluxe version of Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd., Greatest Hits, The Best of the Monkees, and Extended Versions. In 2012, the composition met with controversy for its unexpected use in the television show, Breaking Bad. Dolenz, who was unaware an abridged version of \\"Goin' Down\\" was to be featured on the show, commented, \\"'Goin‚Äô Down' has nothing to do with drugs, obviously. And I certainly don't condone meth ‚Äî that is nasty stuff that kills a lot of people and ruins a lot of lives. ...

Their anti- aircraft (AA) armament consisted of a single Canon de Mod√®le 1924 gun. The ships carried two triple mounts of torpedo tubes amidships. A pair of depth charge chutes were built into their stern that housed a total of sixteen depth charges. Construction and career She was at Oran, French Algeria, as part of the 7th Destroyer Squadron of the Marine Nationale when the Allies invaded French North Africa in Operation Torch in November 1942. On 8 November 1942, Typhon engaged the British cutter HMS Hartland from very short distance, sinking her in the harbour in a matter of minutes, when the Allied vessel was in the process of landing American troops. Later in the morning, Typhon and her sister ships Tramontane and Tornade steamed away in an attempt to attack Allied naval forces at Arzew Bay. The destroyer squadron was met with heavy fire by the British cruiser HMS Aurora. Typhon launched all her six torpedoes at the cruiser to no avail; her sisters were repeatedly hit by 6in shells. Tramontane was sunk and Tornade ran aground, while Typhoon returned to port with half her ammunition expended and without torpedoes, all of them launched at Aurora to no avail. Tramontane's survivors were also aboard. Typhon confronted the Allies once again on 9 November, this time with her sister Epervier. The destroyer attack was beaten off by the British cruisers Jamaica and Aurora; Epervier was hit and beached herself, while Typhon sailed back to Oran, where she was eventually scuttled by her own crew on 10 November 1942.

Education Duneier attended the University of Florida from 1985 to 1987 before leaving to pursue a career in financial management with Drexel Burnham Lambert and then Prudential-Bache. He finished his undergraduate education at Florida Atlantic University with a BBA in finance and economics and received an MBA in finance and economics from New York University's Stern School of Business. Career in Finance While still attending graduate school at NYU, Duneier worked as a foreign exchange option trader specializing in exotic derivatives at Credit Suisse in New York City. He was later hired by Bank of America to expand their foreign exchange business into European crosses and Emerging Markets and eventually promoted to Global Head of Currency Option Trading. Soon after Bank of America merged with Nations Bank, Duneier moved to AIG International where he was eventually named managing director in charge of Emerging Markets trading and based out of London, England. In 2002, Duneier launched a proprietary trading portfolio known as \\"TIP\\" for AIG International. Shortly after the firm merged with Banque AIG, Duneier became a global macro portfolio manager at London Diversified Fund Management in London and later at Peloton Partners in Santa Barbara, California. In 2008, he was one of the founding partners at Grant Capital Partners which grew to $1.25 billion in assets under management. He left in 2012 to launch Bija Capital Management and eventually Bija Advisors LLC, a consulting firm which advises experienced hedge fund managers, CIO's and asset allocators. Through Bija Advisors, he speaks on and publishes a subscription based newsletter covering topics on economics, cognitive science, and investment management. Duneier's book, AlphaBrain is released in March 2019 (Wiley & Sons). Career as a cognitive science practitioner In 2001, Duneier began to apply his approach to decision making, which he calls \\"Bija\\", to his personal life, leading to a long string of eccentric goals and resolutions being set and achieved. In 2012, it reached fever pitch when he embarked upon 12 for 2012, a New Year's resolution which included 12 Learning Resolutions and 12 Giving Resolutions. As part of his resolutions, he has performed at comedy clubs; learned to fly a helicopter; climbed iced waterfalls; raced cars; had root canal without anesthetic; learned to speak German; read 50 books in 52 weeks; participated in the Pier to Peak half marathon; learned to unicycle; used jumping stilts to hike; fostered a pit bull; built homes for families in Arizona; learned ballroom dancing, how to drum, slackline, parkour, skydive; and flown planes acrobatically.{{cite web|title=How to Achieve Your Most Ambitious Goals Stephen Duneier TEDxTucson'|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v;=TQMbvJNRpLE} He set the Guinness World Record for the largest crocheted granny square. It is 1,311 square feet, incorporates more than 30 miles of yarn and weighs over 60 pounds. It took 2 years, 7 months and 17 days to create, and required more than 500,000 double crochet stitches. Duneier now speaks and writes about his experience and how others can take what we have learned from research conducted in the field of cognitive science in order to make better decisions and achieve bigger goals. Career as a Lecturer Duneier teaches undergraduate and graduate level courses on Decision Analysis in the College of Engineering at the University of California in Santa Barbara. 40 ft tall eucalyptus tree 2.6 miles up the Cold Spring Trail wrapped with yarn. Career as an Artist Duneier is an installation artist, part of the fiber-art movement known as Yarnbombing. His installations exist for just 9 days typically in Los Padres National Forest. As part of his 2012 resolution to learn 12 new skills, Duneier learned how to knit. His first project was the covering of a 40-foot tall eucalyptus tree, 2.6 miles up the Cold Spring Trail in Santa Barbara, California. It required 450 square feet of knitted material. The installation remained for just 9 days and all material used was donated to Warm Up America, a charity in North Carolina. The following year he wrapped a massive boulder atop the Saddlerock hiking trail above Montecito, California.

His third installation was a large spiderweb made out of yarn which covered Sasquatch Cave in The Playgrounds at Lizard's Mouth. Sasquatch Cave at Lizards Mouth in Santa Barbara California For his fourth installation, Duneier created a giant starfish made with reflective yarn from Red Heart Yarns and hung it 40 feet above the Seven Falls Trail. Seven Falls Trail in the mountains of Santa Barbara California His fifth installation occurred at Santa Barbara City College where he laid out nearly 2,500 square feet of knitted and crocheted pieces on their lawn. 2,500 square feet of knitted and crocheted material laid out at SBCC in Santa Barbara. 18 massive boulders wrapped with yarn at Lizard's Mouth in Los Padres National Forest above Santa Barbara, CA. For his sixth installation, he invited fiber artists from around the world to collaborate with him by sending crocheted and knitted pieces of any size, shape, color and style to participate. He received contributions from 388 artists in 36 countries and all 50 US States. Combined with his own work, he wrapped 18 giant boulders at Lizards Mouth in the Los Padres National Forest above Santa Barbara in California. 10 aliens and 24 tents covered with yarn line the canyon at Davey Brown Trailhead above Santa Ynez in California. His most recent project was called the Alien Campsite where he incorporated additional materials including fiberglass, wood, and metal in addition to yarn. He created 10 aliens and 24 tents for the installation which lasted just 36 hours before being ripped apart by high winds in the canyon. The installation was permitted by the US Forest Service for the area just below the Davey Brown Trailhead. It incorporated Duneier's own work plus contributions from 656 fiber artists from 41 countries and all 50 states. Duneier's work is represented by the Sullivan Goss Gallery. As part of his stated mission to build a global community kind and creative people, Duneier hosts the Yarnbomber podcast in which he features interviews with famous yarnbombers from around the world including Carol Hummel, London Kaye and Jessie Hemmons.

Life Simmons attended Lincoln University in Missouri where he studied journalism. He interrupted his studies to do military service, and afterwards went to St. Louis' Washington University where he graduated with a B.A. in English Composition. In 1957, his first novel Corner Boy was published and Simmons was awarded a Houghton Mifflin Literary Fellowship. In 1958, the novel saw a British edition. The paperback edition, which also appeared in 1958, helped to make the book popular for a number of years, resulting in respectable sales figures.Herbert Simmons: Corner Boy, Payback Press, Edinburgh 1996. The introduction states: \\"It was a bestselling soft cover for Dell in 1958, and also a soft cover bestseller for Mcfadden Bartell in 1968.\\" p.VII. His second novel, Man Walking on Eggshells appeared in 1962, supposedly as part one of a trilogy titled Destined to Free. However, parts two and three, tentatively titled Tough Country and The Land of Nod never appeared and it is not known whether Simmons ever completed them. The biographical sketch in the former anthology seems to imply that Tough Country was possibly self-published in 1998. However, the Library of Congress does not have this title on record. Following the 1965 Watts riots in Los Angeles the Watts Writers Workshop was established with Simmons one of the key participants. Later, he became a lecturer at California State University, Northridge, retiring in the mid-1990s. Little is known about him, and he has not published new material since 1962, however his two novels have seen a number of new editions. In 1979, Corner Boy was adapted for the stage. Novels Simmons' two novels paint a vivid picture of life in the black ghetto prior to the civil rights movement. The protagonists are young black men drifting between a career in music and street life. Simmons's plots contain elements of naturalism as well as of hardboiled crime fiction. The language and rhythms of Simmons' novels has been compared to Bebop and Cool Jazz, and especially in Man Walking on Eggshells the prose is very rhythmical, following the forms and improvisational patterns of jazz.

Role in the Jeju Uprising  On April 28, 1948, nearly a month into the Jeju Uprising, a leftist rebellion against government police forces on Jeju, Kim Ik-ryeol attempted to negotiate an armistice with the leader of the South Korean Labor party (SKLP) military on Jeju, Kim Dal-sam. The peace accord failed, however, mainly because Kim Ik-ryeol considered Kim Dal-sam‚Äôs demands impossible. On May 6, 1948, Kim Ik-ryeol was replaced by Colonel Park Jin-gyeong as commander of government police forces on Jeju.  Later years  Kim served in the military through the Korean War and beyond.

She was laid down by FCM Graville on 29 September 1923 and launched on 24 January 1925. She was manned for trials on 15 March 1926, and her acceptance trials were on 1 September 1926. Commissioned on 15 March 1927 and officially completed on 31 May 1927, she entered service on 25 June 1928.Jordan & Moulin, p. 42 Cyclone spent her early years as part of the Mediterranean Squadron, based at Toulon, France.Jordan & Moulin, pp. 215‚Äì216 After taking part in combined 1928 maneuvers by the squadrons based at Toulon and Brest, France ‚Äì the largest French naval maneuvers since World War I ‚Äì Cyclone participated in a major naval review attended by President of France Gaston Doumergue at Le Havre, France, on 3 July 1928.Jordan & Moulin, p. 55 During festivities celebrating the 100th anniversary of the first French landing in Algeria on 13 June 1830, she took part in a major naval review off Algiers, French Algeria, on 10 May 1930. In March 1932, she was among ships representing the French Navy at the F√™te v√©nitienne (\\"Venetian Fete\\") at Cannes, France. After taking part in combined 1935 maneuvers by the Brest and Toulon squadrons, she was among the ships involved in a major naval review for French Minister of the Navy Fran√ßois Pi√©tri in France‚Ä≤s Baie de Douarnenez on 27 June 1935. On 5 July 1935, Cyclone transferred to the Second Squadron, based at Brest, for Atlantic service.Jordan & Moulin, p. 217 World War II After World War II broke out in September 1939, Cyclone‚Ä≤s operations included providing escort to Allied convoys. On 17 October 1939, she and one of her sister ships, the destroyer Mistral, were on their way to reinforce the escort of a convoy when her crew thought they sighted the conning tower of a diving submarine. Cyclone dropped depth charges, but saw no sign of them having damaged or sunk a submarine.Jordan & Moulin, p. 224 Other convoys she escorted included Convoy FS 1, which departed Brest on 16 April 1940 and arrived at Greenock, Scotland, on 19 April, and Convoy FP 4, which departed Brest on 26 April 1940 and arrived at Greenock on 29 April.uboat.net FR Cyclone, accessed 30 July 2016. The Battle of France began on 10 May 1940 with the German invasion of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Cyclone was among French destroyers and torpedo boats heavily involved in French operations in the Netherlands, escorting ships transporting French Army troops to Walcheren and then engaging in gunfire support of troops ashore until the Allied evacuation at Vlissingen on 18 May 1940. From 22 to 24 May 1940, she took part in the defense of Boulogne against advancing German forces, which included a number of gunfire support missions.Jordan & Moulin, pp. 227‚Äì228 In late May 1940, Cyclone participated in the Dunkirk evacuation operation. While she was outbound from Dover, England, bound for Dunkirk during the predawn hours of 31 May 1940, the German Navy E-boat S24 hit her with a torpedo, blowing her bow off and leaving two members of her crew missing and presumed dead.Jordan & Moulin, p. 229 The damage slowed Cyclone to a maximum speed of 5 knots. At the request of Cyclone‚Ä≤s commanding officer, the Polish Navy destroyer ORP B≈Çyskawica escorted Cyclone as she limped back toward Dover. The two ships passed the French destroyer Siroco, which was packed with soldiers evacuated from Dunkirk; the German E-boats S23 and S26 torpedoed and sank Siroco an hour later, and B≈Çyskawica left Cyclone to render assistance. After rescuing 15 survivors from Siroco, B≈Çyskawica returned to Cyclone and escorted her the rest of the way to Dover. Cyclone soon proceeded to Cherbourg, France, and then on to Brest, where she arrived on 3 June 1940 to undergo repairs.

She provided shelter to around 80 Jews during the Holocaust and was consequently recognised as Righteous Among the Nations. Biography Abegg was born in 1882 in Strasbourg, then a part of Germany, to Johann Friedrich Abegg, a jurist, and Marie Caroline Elisabeth (R√§hm) Abegg. In 1912, she enrolled at Leipzig University, where she studied history, classical philology and Romance studies, and graduated with a doctorate in 1916. She moved to Berlin in 1918 when the Alsace region was reclaimed by France. In Berlin, she became involved in postwar relief work organised by the Quaker community. She became a teacher at the in Berlin-Mitte in 1924 and was an active member of the German Democratic Party. Abegg openly criticised the Nazi regime after Adolf Hitler assumed power in 1933. She was transferred to another school as punishment for her criticism and was questioned by the Gestapo in 1938. In 1941, she was forced to retire from teaching and officially converted to Quakerism in 1941. She began to help persecuted Jews find safe shelter in 1942. She established an extensive network of rescuers‚Äîincluding her Quaker friends and her former students‚Äîto provide accommodation to Jews in hiding. Abegg temporarily housed dozens of Jews in her Tempelhof apartment, which she shared with her mother and disabled sister, and vacant neighbouring apartments, and secured permanent accommodation for them across Berlin, East Prussia and Alsace. She sold her jewelry to pay for some Jews' escape to Switzerland and tutored hiding Jewish children at her apartment. In total, she sheltered around 80 Jews between 1942 and 1945. left After the Second World War, Abegg resumed teaching in Berlin.
