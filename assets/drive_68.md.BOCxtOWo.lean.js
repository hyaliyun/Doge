It is spoken in the Opobo‚ÄìNkoro LGA of Rivers State, in the Defaka or Afakani ward of Nk·ªçr·ªç town and ·ªäw·ªçma Nk·ªçr·ªç. The low number of Defaka speakers, coupled with the fact that other languages dominate the region where Defaka is spoken, edges the language near extinction on a year-to-year basis. It is generally classified in an Ijoid branch of the Niger‚ÄìCongo family. However, the Ijoid proposal is problematic. Blench (2012) notes that \\"Defaka has numerous external cognates and might be an isolate or independent branch of Niger‚ÄìCongo which has come under ·ªäj·ªç influence.\\"Roger Blench, Niger-Congo: an alternative view People Ethnically, the Defaka people are distinct from the Nkoroo, but they have assimilated to Nkoroo culture to such a degree that their language seems to be the only sign of a distinct Defaka identity. Use of the Defaka language however is quickly receding in favour of the language of the Nkoroo, an Ijaw language. Nowadays, most Defaka speakers are elderly people, and even among these, Defaka is rarely spoken  the total number of Defaka speakers is at most 200 nowadays (SIL/Ethnologue 15th ed.). The decrease in use of Defaka is stronger in Nkoroo town than in the Iwoma area. Since the language communities between Defaka and Nkoroo are so intertwined, it is hard to determine which language influences the other. All children grow up speaking Nkoroo (an Ijo language) as a first language. The next most used language among the Defaka is Igbo, owing to the political influence of the Opobo since the days of the Oil Rivers Trade. Igbo has been a language of instruction in many schools in the region and still functions as a regional trade language. Classification The Defaka language shows many lexical similarities with Ij·ªç, some shared regular sound correspondences and some typological similarities with proto-·ªäj·ªç. For example, both languages have a subject‚Äìobject‚Äìverb basic word order, which is otherwise extremely rare in the Niger‚ÄìCongo language family, being found only in the Mande and Dogon branches. * ebere koÃò okuna …ì√°√°ma (the dog SUBJECT the fowl kill:PAST) The dog killed the fowl (Defaka) * obiri …ì√© oÃò…ì√≥Ãòk≈çÃò …ì√© …ì√°mÃÑ (dog the fowl the kill:PAST) The dog killed the fowl (·ªäj·ªç, Kala…ìar·ªã dialect) Also, Defaka has a sex-gender system distinguishing between masculine, feminine, and neuter 3rd-person singular pronouns; this is once again a rarity among south-central Niger‚ÄìCongo languages other than ·ªäjoid and Defaka. *√° t√≥…ìo 'her head' *o to…ìo 'his head' *y√© t√≥…ìo 'its head' While some of the lexical and maybe typological similarities can be attributed to borrowing (as Defaka has been in close contact with Ij·ªç for more than 300 years), the sound correspondences point to a (somewhat distant) genealogical relationship. Phonology Nearly all Defaka are bilingual in Nk·ªçr·ªç·ªç, and the phonology appears to be the same as that language. =Tone= Defaka has two tones, and . On long vowels and diphthongs, as well as disyllabic words, and contours occur. In addition, there is a downstep that may appear between high tones, and which is the remnant of an elided low tone. However, Shryock et al. were not able to measure significant differences in the pitch traces of , , and ‚Äìdownstep‚Äì, all of which have a falling pitch, suggesting that there may be fewer distinctive word tones than the combinations of syllable tones would suggest. However, these all clearly contrast with level-pitched and rising-pitched . =Vowels= The Ijoid vowel harmony has collapsed in Defaka, as it has in Nk·ªçr·ªç·ªç. There are seven oral vowels, , though and are uncommon. There are five nasal vowels, . All may occur long. Long vowels are at least twice as long as short vowels. =Consonants= { class=\\"IPA wikitable\\" border=\\"1\\" - ! !! Labial !! Alveolar !! Postalveolar ~ palatal !! Velar !! Labial velar - !

The velar plosives & may be lenited to or between vowels. The tap is pronounced as an approximant, , by some speakers. It only occurs between vowels and at the ends of words.

Like many of Beckett's works, the piece was originally composed in French (Acte sans paroles II), then translated into English by Beckett himself. Written in the late 1950sThe Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett states that the work was written in 1958 (p 4), Eugene Webb in The Plays of Samuel Beckett says it was 1959 (pp 86-90), however Deirdre Bair, in Samuel Beckett: A Biography (p 500) indicates that he was working on this as far back as 1956 it opened at the Calderon Press Institute in Oxford and was directed by John McGrath. London premiere was directed by Michael Horovitz and performed at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, on 25 January 1960. The first printing was in New Departures 1, Summer 1959.  Synopsis  Stage directions by BeckettRedrawn according to the drawing on page 211 of The Complete Dramatic Works (Samuel Beckett, Faber & Faber, 2006). Two sacks and a neat pile of clothes sit on a low, \\"violently lit\\"Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 49 platform at the back of a stage. Both sacks contain a man; B is on the left, A on the right. A long pole (described in the text as a \\"goad\\") enters from the right, prods the sack containing A to awaken him to his daily routine, and then exits. After needing a second prod A finally emerges. He is unkempt and disorganised. He gobbles pills, prays, dresses randomly, nibbles a carrot, and promptly \\"spits it out with disgust\\". \\"He is a moper, a hypochondriacal dreamer, perhaps a poet.\\"Lamont, R. C., ‚ÄòTo Speak the Words of \\"The Tribe\\": The Wordlessness of Samuel Beckett‚Äôs Metaphysical Clowns‚Äô in Burkman, K. H., (Ed.) Myth and Ritual in the Plays of Samuel Beckett (London and Toronto: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1987), p 63 His principal activity, without apparent purpose, is to carry the filled sack stage left and crawl back into his own which he does leaving the sack containing B now vulnerable to the goad. The goad reappears, this time with a wheel attachment, and prods the other sack, exiting as before. B is precise, efficient and eager; he only requires a single prod to rouse him. The clothes he ‚Äì presumably ‚Äì folded neatly before are now scattered about (clear evidence of the existence of a third party) but he never reacts to this and simply goes about his business. He knows how to dress and take care of his clothes. He takes greater care of himself (brushing his teeth and exercising), is better organised (he checks his watch ‚Äì eleven times in total ‚Äì and consults a map and compass before setting off to move the sacks), but still his shift is no more meaningful. Even though he has more to do than A, Beckett instructs that B performs his chores briskly so that they should take approximately the same time as A‚Äôs. After moving the sacks he undresses and, rather than dumping his clothes in a pile, B folds them neatly before crawling into his own sack. The goad appears for a third time (now requiring the support of two wheels) and attempts to wake A. Once again he needs two prods. He begins to replay his previous pantomime, but this time is cut off by a blackout, at which point the play ends. Reception The initial reviews ranged \\"from puzzled to disapproving\\"Bair, D., Samuel Beckett: A Biography (London: Vintage, 1990), p 545 and the play fared little better in America but for all that Beckett wrote to Thomas MacGreevy:Samuel Beckett, letter to Thomas McGreevy, 9 February 1960 \\"I have never had such good notices.\\" Alan Schneider believed the problem was that \\"[c]ritics can‚Äôt seem to comment on what‚Äôs before them without dragging in the older [plays] and rationalising their previous reactions.\\"Bair, D., Samuel Beckett: A Biography (London: Vintage, 1990), p 546 In 2000, Patrice Parks wrote in Monterey County Weekly that Act Without Words II ‚Äúhas lost not an iota of relevance to todays mind-numbing workaday grind. If anything, Becketts work has been vindicated with the passage of time.‚Äù Interpretation Persephone supervising Sisyphus in the Underworld, Attic black-figure amphora, c. 530 BC, Staatliche Antikensammlungen (Inv. 1494) \\"The play is compelling only if the mechanical figures are somehow humanised. If comfort exists it is because the plight of humanity if futile or repetitive is at least shared, even if no intercourse exists.\\"Ackerley, C. J. and Gontarski, S. E., (Eds.) The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett, (London: Faber and Faber, 2006), p 4 The two men work together to remove themselves from whatever external or elemental (see \\"Mana\\"Lamont, R.

Myth and Ritual in the Plays of Samuel Beckett (London and Toronto: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1987), p 57) force may be behind the goad; it counters by adding wheels. In time logic dictates they will reach a safe distance where they are beyond its reach but what then? Without it to motivate them, will they remain huddled in their sacks? Is that death? Eugene Webb takes a different stance. He thinks that \\"the goad, represent[s] man's inner compulsion to activity. If man cannot rely on anything outside himself, is there anything inside him, which might prove worthy of his hope and trust? What Act Without Words II has to say about this is that man is driven by a compulsive force that will never let him withdraw for long into inaction.\\"Webb, E., Two Mimes: Act Without Words I and Act Without Words II in The Plays of Samuel Beckett (Seattle, University of Washington Press, 1974), pp 86-90 The Unnamable famously ends with, \\"I can‚Äôt go on, I‚Äôll go on.\\"Beckett, S., Trilogy (London: Calder Publications, 1994), p 418 The goad represents what happens in between these two phrases. There is some similarity between the characters A and B and the protagonists of Beckett's Waiting for Godot, Vladimir and Estragon who spend their time in much the same way, engaged in pointless tasks to amuse themselves and while away the time, though ultimately never leading to anything of significance. That said, B is more businessman-like, \\"a kind of Pozzo ‚Ä¶ grotesquely efficient, a workaholic, a health nut.\\" Between them they present \\"a composite picture of man\\": B is self-reliant and proactive, A prefers to trust in an external god. \\"Act Without Words II shows that life must be endured, if not understood. There are no triumphs, no resolution ‚Ä¶ There is no control over the process, no\\" seeing ‚Äòthe bigger picture‚Äô. \\"[N]either A or B appears to realise that each one of them carries the other on his back [or that there even is an other] ‚Ä¶ they take their burden for granted\\" as does Molloy, to cite a single example, who never questions how he has wound up in his mother‚Äôs room being paid for writing stuff that only gets returned the next week covered in proofreading markings. Indeed, A evokes the vagrant Molloy in the same way as B recalls the detective Moran. The action could take place in a day or two or perhaps over the course of their whole lives. The movement to the left is suggestive however of \\"the walk of Dante and Virgil in the Inferno.\\"From a personal unpublished letter written by Samuel Beckett to the Polish critic and translator Antoni Libera.

Photo taken from offshore by Mike Baird. The south side of Morro Rock from the entrance of Monta√±a de Oro State Park Morro Rock (Salinan: Le'samo, Northern Chumash: Lisamu') is a volcanic plug in Morro Bay, California, on the Pacific Coast at the entrance to Morro Bay harbor. A causeway connects it with the shore, making it a tied island. The rock is protected as the Morro Rock State Preserve. Geology The Morro Rock is one of 13 volcanic plugs (remnant necks of extinct volcanoes), lava domes, and sheetlike intrusions between Morro Bay on the north and Islay Hill on the south, all in San Luis Obispo County. It is composed mostly of dacite, an igneous, volcanic rock, and partially of petrified bird feces, which have compacted into the plug over the years. It is a groundmass of plagioclase, with amphibole (hornblende), biotite, pyroxene (augite), quartz, and glass; phenocrysts of plagioclase, amphibole and often quartz. Its silica (SiO2) content can range from 63 to 69 percent. The dacite volcanic plugs, lava domes, intrusive sheets, and felsitic rhyolite-dacite between Morro Rock and Islay Hill are part of the Mono Rock-Islay Hill Complex of the Oligocene epoch (from 27 to 23 million years ago). The complex lies east of the San Gregorio- San Simeon-Hosgri fault (the SG-SS-H fault). This complex is one of three probable sources of the volcanic clasts within the sandstone and conglomerate of the Miguelito and Edna members of the Pismo Formation in the Point Sur area 145‚Äì160 km (90-100 mi) to the north and west of the SG-SS-H fault. Based on paleomagnetic signatures, the Morro Rock-Islay Hill Complex was rotated 40 to 50 degrees, perhaps during late Miocene or early Pliocene time. History =Tribal= The Salinan and Chumash tribes consider Morro Rock to be a sacred site. The Salinan name for Morro Rock is Le'samo and the Chumash name is Lisamu. The Chumash had an important nearby prehistoric settlement at least as early as the Millingstone Horizon (6500-2000 B.C.E.), and the village was near the mouth of Morro Creek, at the current site of Morro Bay High School. The right of the Salinan people to climb Morro Rock for their biannual solstice ceremonies has been established, in which they celebrate the time in legend when a hawk and a raven destroyed a two-headed serpent-monster Taliyekatapelta as he wrapped his body around the base of the rock. The established Salinan right to climb the rock has been in legal dispute by the local Chumash tribe, which claims that Morro Rock is Chumash, not Salinan, territory. The Chumash also believe that the rock is so sacred that it should never be climbed. Because of its fragility, it is illegal for the general public to climb it. =European sighting= Morro Rock was probably seen by Spanish maritime explorers as early as 1542 under Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo, but its current name was given during the first European land exploration of Alta California. The Spanish Portol√° expedition came down Los Osos Valley and camped near today's Morro Bay on September 8, 1769. Franciscan missionary and expedition member Juan Cresp√≠ noted in his diary that \\"we saw a great rock in the form of a round morro\\". =Exploitation= The rock, which was quarried on and off from 1889 to 1969, provided material for the breakwater of Morro Bay and the improvements at Port San Luis Harbor. In 1966, a state law was adopted that transferred title to the State of California. In February 1968, the San Luis Obispo County Historical Society and the City of Morro Bay succeeded in having Morro Rock declared California Historical Landmark number 821. Flora and fauna Several types of birds nest on Morro Rock, including three cormorant species and two gull species.Joan Easton Lentz and Don DesJardin (2006) Introduction to Birds of the Southern California Coast, University of California Press, 316 pages It presently serves as a reserve for peregrine falcons, which are locally endangered and cause most of the laws that prohibit intervention with avian life. Sea lions and sea otters can be seen regularly in the water around the rock. Seals, however, are much more common in the nearby Morro Bay State Park, where they breed. Other fauna include a wide selection of tide pool animals, like hermit crabs, small fish, starfish, sea cucumbers, mussels, bivalve mollusks, coral, and more. On land few flora can survive the harsh, dry environment on the rock, but in the surrounding bay, kelp, sea grass, kelp forest plants, and tide pool plants can survive, and a few common grasses, mosses, lichens and weeds from the mainland take root on the rock itself. Marine protected areas Morro Bay State Marine Recreational Management Area and Morro Bay State Marine Reserve are protected areas offshore from Morro Bay.

As of June 2007, the Dear Boys series has 25 volumes in total, including the Dear Boys: The Early Days and Dear Boys: Act 2. In 2007, Dear Boys: Act 2 was awarded the Kodansha Manga Award for the sh≈çnen manga. The story concerns the progress of the Mizuho High School basketball team as it attempts to win the prefectural championship. It also deals heavily with the relationship between the players on the team, especially the two main characters Kazuhiko Aikawa and Takumi Fujiwara.  Plot  At the outset of the manga, the Mizuho High School basketball team is in trouble, as there are not enough players to play a game. Additionally, the coach has left after a conflict with Fujiwara. However, Aikawa transfers to Mizuho and through his enthusiasm and sheer love of the game, infuses the few remaining members with a sense of purpose. Despite the fact that there are only five of them (i.e., they have no substitutes), they manage to get the coach of the girls' team to coach them as well. At first, she seems very strict, but later reveals her attachment to her \\"Dear Boys\\". Together, they do their best to make their dreams come true and take their team to the top of the prefecture. The manga isn't only focused on the Mizuho team, but also on several rival teams. In fact, the manga artist spends a bit of time developing the characters of other teams' members.  Characters  ; :He was the one who convinced the remaining players to play basketball again. Mutsumi had once said that it was as if Aikawa reminded them all about how much fun they could've all had playing basketball together. He was once the trump card and captain of the Tend≈çji High's basketball team. He plays the position of small forward in the team. He also has a knack of being able to jump higher than most people, and that makes up for his height disadvantage. Even though he is short, he is able to dunk. :He is considered to be a genius as can be seen in the anime and it is seen that his skills seem to improve with every game that he plays. He is also the best friend of Masato Sawanobori, the star player and point guard of Tend≈çji High School and Fujiwara Takumi, the captain of the Mizuho basketball team. :He is always able to encourage the other players no matter how difficult the game is. :He is romantically involved with Mai Moritaka of the girls' team. ; :Fujiwara is a second-year student at Mizuho High. He is often nicknamed Taku by his close friends and seems to be romantically involved with Mutsumi Akiyoshi of the girls' team. Fujiwara also appears to be very close to his long-time friend, Miura Ranmaru. :He was involved in an incident where he was provoked into punching the coach in his first year. The coach has since transferred to another school and Mizuho's boys' basketball team was banned from any tournament for a year. He is not to be mistaken for Initial D's Takumi Fujiwara. :He has an old injury on his right knee which came from one of his games involving Miura and was ordered by Anzaki to rehabilitate his knee and make it more flexible to improve his playing ability in time for the prefectural tournament. :Fujiwara is the captain of the Mizuho basketball team and plays the position of point guard. He attended Mizuho Junior High and was Miura's teammate at that time as well. :As seen in the anime and said by Aikawa that he (Takumi) is the reason why Aikawa can push himself way beyond his limits. It is denied by Aikawa that he (Fuji) was equal to Masato Sawanabori of Tendouji in skills. ; :Miura has a calm and quiet personality. He has been Fujiwara's best friend since middle school. Miura was seen not to have good stamina at the beginning of the series. He plays the shooting guard position and is the three-point specialist of the team. It was mentioned in the manga that he would rather be scoring points than being the playmaker of the team. He is also talented at stealing balls from his opponents. He is also the one who can shoot fade away three- pointers. :During the match versus Kadena Nishi, he is forced to shoot NBA 3-pointers to help Mizuho win the match. Unfortunately, he was injured due to a foul made by Kenta Shimabukuro. He was then rested for the subsequent match. :Miura attended Mizuho Junior High and was Fujiwara's teammate at that time as well. He blamed himself for causing Fujiwara's knee injury although it is not his fault. In the anime, Keiko Ogami of the girls' team seems to have a crush on him. :Fujiwara had intended Miura to, before the start of the tournament, become a player to be feared. He wants Miura to be like before, be unpredictable with his pinpoint passes, judgement and sharp shooting. ; :Ishii is an extremely short-tempered person. It was highlighted that his weakness is being easily provoked by the opposing team to foul, and is prone to committing four fouls at a crucial time of a match. However, as the team starts to advance to the final, he has grown mature and his skills were also starting to grow more steady and powerful. :He plays the position of power forward in the team. It appears that he and Dobashi are close friends, having played on the same team during middle school. Ishii attended Takakura Junior High. :And it says in the episodes that he matches with the big machine. ; :Dobashi is the largest in the team. He resembles Miura and has a quiet personality. Although his legs are not strong, he proves to his teammates that he can steal, rebound and defend better than ever before. He plays the position of center in the team. :He is often called \\"old man\\" by Ishii because of his hair and appearance. In the anime, before the prefectural championship, he changed his hairstyle. Dobashi attended Takakura Junior High. :As the story passes, he was one of the pillars for the team and his presence is felt. Whenever he was injured, the team performance will fare badly because everyone expects him to be their main guy in defence. ; :Takashina is first seen practising alone in one episode, and later became the 6th member of the boys' team. It was said that he can play any position in a team. He is extremely talented in shooting three pointers, matching up to Miura's level of skill and excellent in rebounds. :It is said that Takashina was a friend of Ayumi Fuse during middle school. ; :Mutsumi is the captain of the girls' basketball team, and is a close friend of Moritaka's. She seems to be romantically involved with Takumi Fujiwara of the boys' team. She plays as a point guard on the team and used to admire Fujiwara's talent. During the quarter finals match, she couldn't play because of her emotional distress, and she fouled many times and was benched. But after Fujiwara opened up to her before the finals, she played to her fullest, making Mizuho win. ; :Mai seems to be romantically involved with Kazuhiko Aikawa and becomes his girlfriend later in the series. Aikawa nicknames her \\"Pony/Pony tail\\" because of her long ponytail when he first saw her. :Her position on the team has never been revealed, neither in the manga nor in the anime. However, after some advice and personal training from Aikawa, Mai has the highest shot percentage among all her teammates when it comes to 3-pointers. ; :Keiko plays as a center for the girls' team and is the tallest among all her teammates. :She appears to have a crush on Miura and is proven on two occasions: one when she gave Miura a 'victory sign', and another when Mutsumi remarked if Keiko would get jealous after seeing a couple of girls approach Miura to congratulate him over the team's recent victory. ; :Masato is Kazuhiko's best friend and another member of the boys' basketball team at Mizuho High school. ; ; :The manager of the Mizuho team, she was in the same junior high as Fujiwara and Miura (one year below them). She used to be a star player in the female basketball team, but suffered an injury that cut off her career as a player. As a result she's become somewhat withdrawn and bitter, to the point the other players think she's too harsh and cold. Over time, however, she warms up to them and does her best to support them. ; :A homeroom teacher and the coach for the Mizuho female team, she takes it upon herself to save the male basketball team from being shut down for good. Being friends and former teammates with Aikawa's older sister, she arranged his transfer from Tend≈çji, believing he could become the soul that would bring out the best in the male basketball team. While she can be strict, it becomes clear she's very fond of her \\"Dear Boys\\", and wants to see them become the team she knows they can be.

Like many Kodansha adaptations (e.g., Peach Girl), it was made on a rather low budget. As a result, it had somewhat lower quality animation than many other sh≈çnen anime that came out in the same year. It follows the storyline of the manga quite closely. Eurobeat music is played during the games, much like how the music genre is featured during the mountain pass races in Initial D. Since the company that produced Hoop Days also produced Initial D, they featured an episode of the cast watching scenes from the then-upcoming Initial D Fourth Stage.

Episodes list  #An Interesting Transfer Student #:Kazuhiko Aikawa has recently transferred to Mizuho High School. When asking a teacher why there was no boys' basketball team he was told that they were not a functioning team and that they were about to be disbanded. Aikawa then declared that he was to be the fifth member of the team so that they could attempt the championship. #The Resurrection Of The Boys' Basketball Team? #Who Is The Opponent For The Practice Team? #:The episode starts with a flashback showing how the star ace from Tend≈çji High's basketball team wound up at Mizuho. Basketball practice starts and once again the boys, barring Aikawa, don't show up. However the episode shows them all gathering things for basketball or practicing. The final day for the ban has come and Aikawa shows up to the gym to practice a little only to find Miura, Ishii, and Dobashi already there. When Aikawa comments on Fujiwara not being there, he is told that it's not a problem that he'll show up. The next day all five members of the boys' basketball team show up at practice. They play a brief game against the girls only to fail horribly showing that they don't play well together. In order to give them a little initiative coach Akiyoshi pits them against Narita high school in a practice match.

The justification for ecocentrism usually consists in an ontological belief and subsequent ethical claim. The ontological belief denies that there are any existential divisions between human and non-human nature sufficient to claim that humans are either (a) the sole bearers of intrinsic value or (b) possess greater intrinsic value than non-human nature. Thus the subsequent ethical claim is for an equality of intrinsic value across human and non-human nature, or biospherical egalitarianism.Answers.com. Retrieved 13 June 2009.  Quotes  According to Stan Rowe:Stan Rowe, biographic profile. and: Origin of term The ecocentric ethic was conceived by Aldo LeopoldLeopold, A. 1949. A sand county almanac. New York: Oxford University Press. and recognizes that all species, including humans, are the product of a long evolutionary process and are inter-related in their life processes.Lindenmeyer, D. & Burgman, M. 2005. Practical conservation biology. CSIRO Publishing, Collingwood, Australia. The writings of Aldo Leopold and his idea of the land ethic and good environmental management are a key element to this philosophy. Ecocentrism focuses on the biotic community as a whole and strives to maintain ecosystem composition and ecological processes.Booth, D.E. 1992. The economics and ethics of old growth forests. Environmental Ethics 14: 43-62. The term also finds expression in the first principle of the deep ecology movement, as formulated by Arne N√¶ss and George Sessions in 1984Arne N√¶ssNaess, Arne & Sessions, George 1984. \\"A Deep Ecology Eight Point Platform\\" cited in Deep Ecology for the 21st Century, Readings on the Philosophy and Practice of the New Environmentalism, ed. George Sessions, Shambhala, Boston and London, 1995. which points out that anthropocentrism, which considers humans as the center of the universe and the pinnacle of all creation, is a difficult opponent for ecocentrism.\\"Ecocentrism and the Deep Ecology Platform\\". Background Environmental thought and the various branches of the environmental movement are often classified into two intellectual camps: those that are considered anthropocentric, or \\"human-centred,\\" in orientation and those considered biocentric, or \\"life-centred\\". This division has been described in other terminology as \\"shallow\\" ecology versus \\"deep\\" ecology and as \\"technocentrism\\" versus \\"ecocentrism\\". Ecocentrism can be seen as one stream of thought within environmentalism, the political and ethical movement that seeks to protect and improve the quality of the natural environment through changes to environmentally harmful human activities by adopting environmentally benign forms of political, economic, and social organization and through a reassessment of humanity's relationship with nature. In various ways, environmentalism claims that non-human organisms and the natural environment as a whole deserve consideration when appraising the morality of political, economic, and social policies. Relationship to other similar philosophies =Anthropocentrism= Ecocentrism is taken by its proponents to constitute a radical challenge to long-standing and deeply rooted anthropocentric attitudes in Western culture, science, and politics. Anthropocentrism is alleged to leave the case for the protection of non-human nature subject to the demands of human utility, and thus never more than contingent on the demands of human welfare. An ecocentric ethic, by contrast, is believed to be necessary in order to develop a non-contingent basis for protecting the natural world. Critics of ecocentrism have argued that it opens the doors to an anti-humanist morality that risks sacrificing human well-being for the sake of an ill- defined ‚Äògreater good‚Äô.Ecocentrism at answers.com Deep ecologist Arne Naess has identified anthropocentrism as a root cause of the ecological crisis, human overpopulation, and the extinctions of many non-human species.Naess, Arne 1973. \\"The Shallow and the Deep, Long-Range Ecology Movement\\". Inquiry 16: 95-100 Lupinacci also points to anthropocentrism as a root cause of environmental degradation. Others point to the gradual historical realization that humans are not the centre of all things, that \\"A few hundred years ago, with some reluctance, Western people admitted that the planets, Sun and stars did not circle around their abode. In short, our thoughts and concepts though irreducibly anthropomorphic need not be anthropocentric.\\"see Rowe = Industrocentrism = Industrocentrism is an ideology that goes hand in hand with today's industrial neoliberal capitalist agenda. It sees all things on earth as resources to be utilized by humans or to be commodified. This view is the opposite of anthropocentrism and ecocentrism. It negatively affects humans, nonhumans, and the environment in the long run in that it only focuses on short term economic gratification. =Technocentrism= Ecocentrism is also contrasted with technocentrism (meaning values centred on technology) as two opposing perspectives on attitudes towards human technology and its ability to affect, control and even protect the environment. Ecocentrics, including \\"deep green\\" ecologists, see themselves as being subject to nature, rather than in control of it. They lack faith in modern technology and the bureaucracy attached to it. Ecocentrics will argue that the natural world should be respected for its processes and products, and that low impact technology and self-reliance is more desirable than technological control of nature.\\"Earth, ecocentrism and Technocentrism\\". Technocentrics, including imperialists, have absolute faith in technology and industry and firmly believe that humans have control over nature. Although technocentrics may accept that environmental problems do exist, they do not see them as problems to be solved by a reduction in industry. Rather, environmental problems are seen as problems to be solved using science. Indeed, technocentrics see that the way forward for developed and developing countries and the solutions to our environmental problems today lie in scientific and technological advancement. =Biocentrism= The distinction between biocentrism and ecocentrism is ill- defined. Ecocentrism recognizes Earth's interactive living and non-living systems rather than just the Earth's organisms (biocentrism) as central in importance.\\"Ecocentrism\\". The Oxford Pocket Dictionary of Current English. 2009. Encyclopedia.com.. Retrieved 13 June 2009.

In Japan, it is called a g≈çshi gaisha.  Description  Partnerships may be formed in the legal forms of General Partnership (, GbR), or specialized in trading (, OHG), or Limited Partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft, KG). In the OHG, all partners are fully liable for the partnership's debts, whereas in the KG there are general partners (Komplement√§r) with unlimited liability and limited partners (Kommanditisten) whose liability is restricted to their fixed contributions to the partnership. Although a partnership itself is not a legal entity, it may acquire rights and incur liabilities, acquire title to real estate and sue or be sued. For example, a Gesellschaft mit beschr√§nkter Haftung & Compagnie KG (GmbH & Co. KG) is a limited partnership with, typically, the sole general partner being a limited liability company. It can thus combine the advantages of a partnership with those of the limited liability of a corporation. A dormant partnership (stille Gesellschaft) comes into existence when a person makes a contribution to an existing enterprise (company, partnership, sole proprietorship) and shares in the latter's profits. The dormant partner has no liability for the debts of the enterprise; in case of insolvency of the enterprise he is a creditor with the portion of his contribution not consumed by losses. Strictly speaking, the dormant partnership is nothing more than an 'undisclosed participation'. A Civil-Law Association is not a legal entity and cannot sue or be sued. It is often used for single joint ventures (e.g. construction projects) and comes to an end when the joint project has been completed. A Private Foundation (Privatstiftung) constitutes a conglomeration of property having legal personality but no shareholders; its activities involve managing its own funds and assets for the beneficiaries.

The declaration marked the start of the diplomatic and armed resistance of the Indonesian National Revolution, fighting against the forces of the Netherlands and pro-Dutch civilians, until the latter officially acknowledged Indonesia's independence in 1949. The document was signed by Sukarno (who signed his name \\"Soekarno\\" using the Van Ophuijsen orthography) and Mohammad Hatta, who were appointed president and vice-president respectively the following day. The date of the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence was made a public holiday by a government decree issued on 18 June 1946.  Background  In 1602, the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and became the dominant European power for almost 200 years. The VOC was dissolved in 1800 following bankruptcy, and the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalised colony. The Dutch colonial government was a centralist hierarchical system, where Indonesian representation was limited in the government. Resistance to Dutch rule was met with imprisonment and exile. The fight for independence from the Netherlands included numerous people, and internal conflicts. It involved an Indonesian youth movement, where the youth were from varying class and educational backgrounds. It included figures such as Chaerul Saleh who was part of Menteng 31, which contained a diverse membership with different educational backgrounds. It also included Kaigun (Wikana) another figure part of the youth movement, who was a student of Sukarno. The fight for independence included a figure in the nationalist movement called Mohammad Hatta who worked to promote Indonesian interests. Another figure in the nationalist movement in Indonesian history was Sukarno, who established the Indonesian National Party in 1927, which advocated for independence from the Dutch. Hatta was educated at a Dutch university and Sukarno studied at the Bandung Institute of Technology where the study group he formed became the Indonesian National Party. Sukarno is known for many famous speeches and advocated for political independence. A speech given in June 1945 by Sukarno ‚ÄòPancasila‚Äô sets out the five principles of the foundation of the nation of Indonesia. In this speech he discusses the importance for political independence, with the first principle being nationalism and also the importance of religion to Indonesia in the principle of a belief in God. The invasion by the Japanese in Indonesia added a new dynamic for the fight for independence. The Japanese defeated the Dutch in 1942 and moved into Indonesia, and this helped push the Dutch out and assisted towards the proclamation of independence. There were uprisings against the Japanese rule like the Dutch, where farmers and other workers were being exploited by the Japanese. Furthermore, the Japanese had also tried to control Islam. Sukarno discusses in his speeches during the war that he believed independence could be achieved with the assistance of Japan. Hatta also worked with the Japanese, as he wanted to free Indonesian people from the Dutch. Hatta and Sjahrir another figure in the nationalist movement worked together towards independence for Indonesia. Where Hatta worked with the Japanese, Sjahrir focused on establishing an underground support network. Many educated youths influenced by Sjahrir in Jakarta and Bandung started establishing underground support networks for plans of Indonesian independence following Japan's defeat. The end of the war on August 15 further expedited the process for independence. Youth leaders supported by Sjahrir hoped for a declaration of independence separate from the Japanese, which initially was not supported by Hatta and Sukarno. However, with the assistance of a high ranking Japanese military officer Tadashi Maeda, the declaration of independence was drafted. Sukarno and Hatta on August 17, 1945 proclaimed independence, along with the youth leaders. Declaration Sukarno praying before proclaiming the independence of Indonesia The draft was prepared only a few hours earlier on the night of 16 August 1945, by Sukarno, Hatta, and Soebardjo, at the house of Rear-Admiral Tadashi Maeda, 1 . The house which is located in Jakarta is now the Formulation of Proclamation Text Museum situated at Jl. Imam Bonjol No. 1. Aside from the three Indonesian leaders and Admiral Maeda, three Japanese agents were also present at the drafting: Tomegoro Yoshizumi (of the Navy Communications Office ); Shigetada Nishijima and Shunkichiro Miyoshi (of the Imperial Japanese Army). The original Indonesian Declaration of Independence was typed by Sayuti Melik. Maeda himself was sleeping in his room upstairs. He was agreeable to the idea of Indonesia's independence, and had lent his house for the drafting of the declaration. Marshal Terauchi, the highest-ranking Japanese leader in South East Asia and son of former Prime Minister Terauchi Masatake, was however against Indonesia's independence, scheduled for 24 August 1945. While the formal preparation of the declaration, and the official independence itself for that matter, had been carefully planned a few months earlier, the actual declaration date was brought forward almost inadvertently as a consequence of the Japanese unconditional surrender to the Allies on 15 August 1945. The wording of the proclamation had been discussed at length to balance both conflicting internal Indonesian and Japanese interests, so that it was not worded as formally transferring authority, and would not provoke Indonesian youths into violence. The term ‚ÄòTRANSFER OF POWER‚Äô was used in Indonesian to satisfy Japanese interests to appear that it was an administrative transfer of power, although the term used ‚Äòpemindahan kekuasaan‚Äô could be perceived to mean political power. The wording ‚ÄòBY CAREFUL MEANS‚Äô related to preventing conflict with members of the youth movement. The wording ‚ÄòIN THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME‚Äô was used to meet the needs of all Indonesians for independence. The historic event was triggered by internal conflict between the youth movement and other individuals working towards independence, where Adam Malik suggests a meeting had taken place which discussed proclaiming independence outside of Japan's framework due to Japan's surrender. It included figures from the youth movement such as Chaerul and Wikana, where Wikana in Sukarno's house had encouraged Sukarno to proclaim independence immediately. The declaration was to be signed by the 27 members of the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) symbolically representing the new nation's diversity. The particular act was apparently inspired by the similar spirit of the United States Declaration of Independence. However, the idea was strongly opposed down by the youth movement, who argued that the committee was too closely associated with the then soon to be defunct Japanese occupation rule, thus creating a potential credibility issue. Instead, members of the youth movement demanded that the signatures of six of them were to be put on the document. All parties involved in the historical moment finally agreed on a compromise solution which only included Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta as the co-signers, 'in the name of the people of Indonesia'. Initially the proclamation was to be announced at Djakarta central square, but the military had been sent to monitor the area, so the venue was changed to Sukarno's house at Pegangsaan Timur 56. The declaration of independence passed without a hitch.The proclamation was prevented from being broadcast on the radio to the outside world by Yamamoto and Nishimura from the Japanese military, and was also initially prevented from being reported in the newspapers. However Shigetada Nishijima and Tadashi Maeda enabled the proclamation to be dispersed via telephone and telegraph. The proclamation at 56, Jalan Pegangsaan Timur, Jakarta, was heard throughout the country because the text was secretly broadcast by Indonesian radio personnel using the transmitters of the .The Domei news agency was used to send the text of the proclamation to reach Bandung and Jogjakarta. Members of the youth movement in Bandung facilitated broadcasts of the proclamation in Indonesian and English from radio Bandung. Furthermore, the local radio system was connected with the Central Telegraph Office and it broadcast the proclamation overseas. Moreover, Sukarno's speech that he gave on the day of the proclamation was not fully published. During his speech he discusses the perseverance for the independence of Indonesia under Dutch and Japanese rule, and he states Indonesia being free from any other country.

Aftermath of the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence  The day after the proclamation, the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence met and elected Sukarno as president and Hatta as vice-president. it also ratified the Constitution of Indonesia. The Dutch, as the former colonial power, viewed the republicans as collaborators with the Japanese, and desired to restore their colonial rule, as they still had political and economic interests in the former Dutch East Indies. The result was a four-year war for Indonesian independence. Indonesian youths had played an important role in the proclamation, and they played a central role in the Indonesian National Revolution. One of the other changes that had also taken place during the Japanese occupation included the population in Indonesia undertaking military training. Conflict occurred not only with the Dutch, but also when the Japanese tried to re-establish control in October 1945 in Bandung, and furthermore when the British tried to establish control. After a long struggle for independence, the freedom of Indonesia from the Dutch in 1949 was part of a period of time of decolonization in Asia. Debate over Dutch recognition of independence date In 2005, the Netherlands declared that it had decided to accept de facto 17 August 1945 as Indonesia's independence date, which has been interpreted by Indonesian media as an official acceptance of the independence date. However, on 14 September 2011, a Dutch court ruled in the Rawagede massacre case that the Dutch state was responsible because it had the duty to defend its inhabitants, which also indicated that the area was part of the Dutch East Indies, in contradiction of the Indonesian claim of 17 August 1945 as its date of independence. In a 2013 interview the Indonesian historian Sukotjo, among others, asked the Dutch government to formally acknowledge the date of independence as 17 August 1945. Before the state visit of King Willem-Alexander (and Queen M√°xima) of the Netherlands to Indonesia in 2020, a small group represented by Abdul Halik wrote to him with a few other relatives. As far as they were concerned, the king was not welcome as long as the Netherlands does not legally recognize the Indonesian independence date, 17 August 1945. \\"We ask for recognition of that date and for apologies. Those who have made mistakes should apologise to those who have suffered.\\" The United Nations recognizes the date of 27 December 1949.

Film adaptations were released in 1943 and 1975. Plot summary The first part of the novel focuses on Colonel Haki, the dour but basically likable head of Turkish Security, who already made his first appearance in The Mask of Dimitrios and returns in later Ambler stories as a general. The protagonist is a British engineer traveling back from Turkey, where he had completed high-level technical talks which could help cement a Turkish-British alliance in the recently started Second World War. German spies seek to assassinate him. Most of the plot takes place on board an Italian ship, where the protagonist travels in company with his nemesis - a German intellectual spymaster, accompanied by a Romanian hired killer - and with a rich cast of other characters, such as a Turkish secret agent, a Spanish courtesan and her pimp, and a French couple of which the husband is left-leaning and his wife is a staunch reactionary. Analysis As common in Ambler's books, the protagonist is not a professional spy, and is clearly out of his depth. Indeed, the chief Nazi treats him with open contempt, which for much of the book seems amply justified. Yet ultimately the German professional pays dearly for underestimating this amateur - another plot element which was to be repeated in later Ambler books. The book came to be regarded as a classic among spy thrillers, setting out what became some of the genre's basic conventions and immensely influencing later works including the James Bond series. Part of the book's lasting charm is its capturing the atmosphere and mindset of the \\"Phony War\\" phase during which it was written: France is standing strong and nobody dreams that it would fall within a few months, the Italians are strictly neutral and there is no suggestion that they are about to ally with Germany against Britain, and so on. From the book it seems that Amblerlike many Britons at the time of writingexpected the war to be more or less a replay of the First World War. Film adaptations A 1943 film adaptation starred Joseph Cotten, with Orson Welles acting and producing. In 1975, Daniel Mann remade Journey Into Fear with Sam Waterston and Vincent Price. The film was the first major Hollywood production to be filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In 2001, a Vancouver-based artist, Stan Douglas, remade the movie as a film installation with a recombinant soundtrack.

Attributes are arranged as nodes by ability to classify examples. Values of attributes are represented by branches. In decision tree learning, ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) is an algorithm invented by Ross QuinlanQuinlan, J. R. 1986. Induction of Decision Trees. Mach. Learn. 1, 1 (Mar. 1986), 81‚Äì106 used to generate a decision tree from a dataset. ID3 is the precursor to the C4.5 algorithm, and is typically used in the machine learning and natural language processing domains. Algorithm The ID3 algorithm begins with the original set S as the root node. On each iteration of the algorithm, it iterates through every unused attribute of the set S and calculates the entropy \\\\Eta{(S)} or the information gain IG(S) of that attribute. It then selects the attribute which has the smallest entropy (or largest information gain) value. The set S is then split or partitioned by the selected attribute to produce subsets of the data. (For example, a node can be split into child nodes based upon the subsets of the population whose ages are less than 50, between 50 and 100, and greater than 100.) The algorithm continues to recurse on each subset, considering only attributes never selected before. Recursion on a subset may stop in one of these cases: * every element in the subset belongs to the same class; in which case the node is turned into a leaf node and labelled with the class of the examples. * there are no more attributes to be selected, but the examples still do not belong to the same class. In this case, the node is made a leaf node and labelled with the most common class of the examples in the subset. * there are no examples in the subset, which happens when no example in the parent set was found to match a specific value of the selected attribute. An example could be the absence of a person among the population with age over 100 years. Then a leaf node is created and labelled with the most common class of the examples in the parent node's set. Throughout the algorithm, the decision tree is constructed with each non-terminal node (internal node) representing the selected attribute on which the data was split, and terminal nodes (leaf nodes) representing the class label of the final subset of this branch. =Summary= # Calculate the entropy of every attribute a of the data set S. # Partition (\\"split\\") the set S into subsets using the attribute for which the resulting entropy after splitting is minimized; or, equivalently, information gain is maximum. # Make a decision tree node containing that attribute. # Recurse on subsets using the remaining attributes. =Pseudocode= ID3 (Examples, Target_Attribute, Attributes) Create a root node for the tree If all examples are positive, Return the single-node tree Root, with label = +. If all examples are negative, Return the single-node tree Root, with label = -. If number of predicting attributes is empty, then Return the single node tree Root, with label = most common value of the target attribute in the examples. Otherwise Begin A ‚Üê The Attribute that best classifies examples. Decision Tree attribute for Root = A. For each possible value, , of A, Add a new tree branch below Root, corresponding to the test A = . Let Examples() be the subset of examples that have the value for A If Examples() is empty Then below this new branch add a leaf node with label = most common target value in the examples Else below this new branch add the subtree ID3 (Examples(), Target_Attribute, Attributes ‚Äì {A}) End Return Root =Properties= ID3-generated decision tree used to determine whether a particular nucleotide pair within a pre-mRNA sequence corresponds to an mRNA splice site. This tree has been shown to have a 95% correct prediction rate. ID3 does not guarantee an optimal solution. It can converge upon local optima. It uses a greedy strategy by selecting the locally best attribute to split the dataset on each iteration. The algorithm's optimality can be improved by using backtracking during the search for the optimal decision tree at the cost of possibly taking longer. ID3 can overfit the training data. To avoid overfitting, smaller decision trees should be preferred over larger ones. This algorithm usually produces small trees, but it does not always produce the smallest possible decision tree. ID3 is harder to use on continuous data than on factored data (factored data has a discrete number of possible values, thus reducing the possible branch points). If the values of any given attribute are continuous, then there are many more places to split the data on this attribute, and searching for the best value to split by can be time consuming. =Usage= The ID3 algorithm is used by training on a data set S to produce a decision tree which is stored in memory. At runtime, this decision tree is used to classify new test cases (feature vectors) by traversing the decision tree using the features of the datum to arrive at a leaf node. The class of this terminal node is the class the test case is classified as. The ID3 metrics =Entropy= Entropy \\\\Eta{(S)} is a measure of the amount of uncertainty in the (data) set S (i.e. entropy characterizes the (data) set S). : \\\\Eta{(S)} = \\\\sum_{x \\\\in X}{-p(x) \\\\log_{2}p(x)} Where, * S ‚Äì The current dataset for which entropy is being calculated This changes at each step of the ID3 algorithm, either to a subset of the previous set in the case of splitting on an attribute or to a \\"sibling\\" partition of the parent in case the recursion terminated previously. * X ‚Äì The set of classes in S * p(x) ‚Äì The proportion of the number of elements in class x to the number of elements in set S When \\\\Eta{(S)} = 0, the set S is perfectly classified (i.e. all elements in S are of the same class). In ID3, entropy is calculated for each remaining attribute. The attribute with the smallest entropy is used to split the set S on this iteration. Entropy in information theory measures how much information is expected to be gained upon measuring a random variable; as such, it can also be used to quantify the amount to which the distribution of the quantity's values is unknown. A constant quantity has zero entropy, as its distribution is perfectly known. In contrast, a uniformly distributed random variable (discretely or continuously uniform) maximizes entropy. Therefore, the greater the entropy at a node, the less information is known about the classification of data at this stage of the tree; and therefore, the greater the potential to improve the classification here. As such, ID3 is a greedy heuristic performing a best-first search for locally optimal entropy values. Its accuracy can be improved by preprocessing the data. = Information gain = Information gain IG(A) is the measure of the difference in entropy from before to after the set S is split on an attribute A. In other words, how much uncertainty in S was reduced after splitting set S on attribute A. : IG(S, A) = \\\\Eta{(S)} - \\\\sum_{t \\\\in T} p(t)\\\\Eta{(t)} = \\\\Eta{(S)} - \\\\Eta{(SA)}. Where, *\\\\Eta(S) ‚Äì Entropy of set S * T ‚Äì The subsets created from splitting set S by attribute A such that S = \\\\bigcup_{t \\\\in T} t * p(t) ‚Äì The proportion of the number of elements in t to the number of elements in set S *\\\\Eta(t) ‚Äì Entropy of subset t In ID3, information gain can be calculated (instead of entropy) for each remaining attribute.

It was concluded in 1793 by the Company administration headed by Charles, Earl Cornwallis. It formed one part of a larger body of legislation, known as the Cornwallis Code. The Cornwallis Code of 1793 divided the East India Company's service personnel into three branches: revenue, judicial, and commercial. Revenues were collected by zamindars, native Indians who were treated as landowners. This division created an Indian landed class that supported British authority. The Permanent Settlement was introduced first in Bengal and Bihar and later in the south district of Madras and Varanasi. The system eventually spread all over northern India by a series of regulations dated 1 May 1793. These regulations remained in place until the Charter Act of 1833. The other two systems prevalent in India were the Ryotwari System and the Mahalwari System. Many argue that the settlement and its outcome had several shortcomings when compared with its initial goals of increasing tax revenue, creating a Western- European style land market in Bengal, and encouraging investment in land and agriculture, thereby creating the conditions for long-term economic growth for both the company and region's inhabitants. Firstly, the policy (Krishna) of fixing the rate of expected tax revenue for the foreseeable future meant that the income of the Company from taxation actually decreased in the long-term because revenues remained fixed while expenses increased over time. Meanwhile, the condition of the Bengali peasantry became increasingly pitiable, with famines becoming a regular occurrence as landlords (who risked immediate loss of their land if they failed to deliver the expected amount from taxation) sought to guarantee revenue by coercing the local agriculturalists to cultivate cash crops such as cotton, indigo, and jute, while long-term private investment by the zamindars in agricultural infrastructure failed to materialise. Background Earlier zamindars in Bengal, Bihar and Odisha had been functionaries who held the right to collect revenue on behalf of the Mughal emperor and his representative, the diwan, in Bengal. The diwan supervised the zamindars to ensure they were neither lax nor overly stringent. When the East India Company was awarded the diwani or overlordship of Bengal by the empire following the Battle of Buxar in 1764, it found itself short of trained administrators, especially those familiar with local custom and law. As a result, landholders were unsupervised or reported to corrupt and indolent officials. The result was that revenues were extracted without regard for future income or local welfare. Following the devastating famine of 1770, which was partially caused by this shortsightedness, Company officials in Calcutta better understood the importance of oversight of revenue officials. Warren Hastings, then governor-general, introduced a system of five-yearly inspections and temporary tax farmers. They did not want to take direct control of local administration in villages for several reasons, including that Company did not want to annoy those people who had traditionally enjoyed power and prestige in rural Bengal. The Company failed to consider the question of incentivisation. Many appointed tax farmers absconded with as much revenue as they could during the time period between inspections. The British Parliament took note of the disastrous consequences of the system, and in 1784, British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger directed the Calcutta administration to alter it immediately. In 1786 Charles Cornwallis was sent out to India to reform the company's practices. In 1786, the East India Company Court of Directors first proposed a permanent settlement for Bengal, changing the policy then being followed by Calcutta, which was attempting to increase taxation of zamindars. Between 1786 and 1790, the new Governor- General Lord Cornwallis and Sir John Shore (later Governor-General) entered a heated debate over whether or not to introduce a permanent settlement with the zamindars. Shore argued that the native zamindars would not trust the permanent settlement to be permanent and that it would take time before they realised it was genuine. The main aim of the Permanent Settlement was to resolve the problem of agrarian crisis and distress that had resulted in lower agricultural output. The British officials thought that investment in agriculture, trade, and the resources of the revenue of the State could be increased by agriculture. For this, permanently fixing the revenue and securing the rights of property was done- a system came to be known as the 'Permanent Settlement'. The British thought that once the revenue demands of the State were permanently set, there would be a regular flow of tax income. Furthermore, landholders would invest in their agricultural land as the producer can keep surpluses in excess of the fixed tax. The British officials thought that such a process would lead to the emergence of yeomen class of farmers and rich landowners who would invest their capital to generate further surpluses. This new emergent class would be loyal to the British, who were still gaining a foothold in the Indian subcontinent. While the policy was well-intentioned, it failed to identify individuals who were willing to contract to pay fixed revenue perpetually and to invest in the improvement of agriculture. After much discussion and disagreement between the officials, the Permanent Settlement was made with the existing Rajas and Taluqdars of Bengal who were now classified as Zamindars. They had to pay fixed revenue in perpetuity. Thus, zamindars were not the landowners but rather revenue collector agents of the State. Cornwallis believed that they would immediately accept it and so begin investing in improving their land. In 1790, the Court of Directors issued a ten-year (decennial) settlement to the zamindars, which was made permanent in 1793. By the Permanent Settlement Act of 1793, their power of keeping the armed forces were taken back. They remained just the tax collectors of the land. There were considerably weakened as they were now banned from holding any court, as it was brought under the supervision of collector appointed by the company. British officials believed that investing in the land would improve the economy. The system failed in the long run due to operational difficulty as well as because the Permanent Settlement did not take account of the seasonal and precarious nature of Bengali agriculture. The Company also did not understand the structural issues as well as the society.http://ncert.nic.in/ncerts/l/lehs301.pdf Overview The question of incentivisation now being understood to be central, the security of tenure of landlords was guaranteed. In short, the former landholders and revenue intermediaries were granted proprietorial rights (effective ownership) to the land they held. Smallholders were no longer permitted to sell their land, but they could not be expropriated by their new landlords. Incentivisation of zamindars was intended to encourage improvements of the land, such as drainage, irrigation and the construction of roads and bridges; such infrastructure had been insufficient through much of Bengal. With a fixed land tax, zamindars could securely invest in increasing their income without any fear of having the increase taxed away by the Company. Cornwallis made the motivation quite clear by declaring that \\"when the demand of government is fixed, an opportunity is afforded to the landholder of increasing his profits, by the improvement of his lands\\". The British had in mind \\"improving landlords\\" in their own country, such as Coke of Norfolk. The Court of Directors also hoped to guarantee the company's income, which was constantly plagued by defaulting zamindars who fell into arrears, making it impossible for them to budget their spending accurately. The immediate consequence of the Permanent Settlement was both very sudden and dramatic, one that nobody had apparently foreseen. By ensuring that zamindars' lands were held in perpetuity and with a fixed tax burden, they became desirable commodities. In addition, the government tax demand was inflexible, and the British East India Company's collectors refused to make allowances for times of drought, flood or other natural disaster. The tax demand was higher than that in England at the time. As a result, many zamindars immediately fell into arrears. The Company's policy of auction of any zamindari lands deemed to be in arrears created a market for land that previously did not exist. Many of the new purchasers of this land were Indian officials within the East India Company's government. The bureaucrats were ideally placed to purchase lands which they knew to be underassessed and therefore profitable. In addition, their position as officials gave them opportunity to acquire the wealth necessary to purchase land. They could also manipulate the system to bring to sale land that they specifically wanted. Historian Bernard S. Cohn and others have argued that the Permanent Settlement led to a commercialisation of land that previously did not exist in Bengal and, as a consequence, it led to a change in the social background of the ruling class from \\"lineages and local chiefs\\" to \\"under civil servants and their descendants, and to merchants and bankers\\". The new landlords were different in their outlook; \\"often they were absentee landlords who managed their land through managers and who had little attachment to their land\\". Influence The Company hoped that the Zamindar class would not only be a revenue-generating instrument but also serve as intermediaries for the more political aspects of their rule, preserving local custom and protecting rural life from the possibly rapacious influences of its own representatives. However, it worked both ways, as zamindars became a naturally conservative interest group. Once British policy in the mid-19th century changed to one of reform and intervention in custom, the zamindars were vocal in their opposition. The Permanent Settlement had the features that state demand was fixed at 89% of the rent and 11% was to be retained by the zamindar. The state demand could not be increased but payment should be made on the due date, before sunset, so it was also known as the 'Sunset Law'. Failure to pay led to the sale of land to the highest bidder. While the worst of the tax-farming excesses were countered by the introduction of the Settlement, the use of land was not part of the agreement. There was a tendency of Company officials and Indian landlords to force their tenants into plantation-style farming of cash crops like indigo and cotton rather than rice and wheat. That was a cause of many of the worst famines of the nineteenth century. Once the salient features of the Permanent Settlement were reproduced all over India, and indeed elsewhere in the Empire, including Kenya, the political structure was altered forever. The landlord class held much greater power than they had under the Mughals, who subjected them to oversight by a trained bureaucracy with the power to attenuate their tenure. The power of the landlord caste/class over smallholders was not diluted in India until the first efforts towards land reform in the 1950s, still incomplete everywhere except West Bengal. In Pakistan, where land reform was never carried out, elections in rural areas still suffer from a tendency towards oligarchy, reflecting the concentration of influence in the hands of zamindar families. This is because once Pakistan became separated from India, and the two began to fight over Kashmir, the goal of the government was revenue extraction to fund the military. As a result, the central leadership skewed the relationship between the elected and non- elected institutions of the state.  References  Further reading * Agrawal, Pramod Kumar (1993).

Welles thought highly of Joseph Cotten as a comic actor, and cast him as the lead in the farce. Other Mercury Theatre actors included Ruth Ford, Arlene Francis, Howard Smith, Mary Wickes and Eustace Wyatt. Welles's wife, Virginia Nicolson, appeared in the film under her professional pseudonym Anna Stafford. Bit parts were given to Welles's Mercury Theatre producer John Houseman, assistant director John Berry, composer Marc Blitzstein, and Herbert Drake, the New York Herald Tribune drama reporter who became the Mercury Theatre's publicist and, later, vice president. Although writer Frank Brady reported that Welles gave himself a small role as a Keystone Kop, Welles is not seen in the film. Among the uncredited extras for a crowd sequence was a young Judy Holliday.McBride, Joseph, What Ever Happened to Orson Welles? A Portrait of an Independent Career. Lexington, Kentucky: The University Press of Kentucky, 2006 page 103 Harry Dunham, a newsreel and documentary cameraman who was an old friend of Paul Bowles, was the film's cinematographer. Location photography took place in New York City's Battery Park and Central Park. Additional shooting took place on a Hudson River day-trip excursion boat and at locations in Yonkers, New York, and Haverstraw, New York.

He edited the footage on a Moviola in his suite at the St. Regis Hotel in New York City, and John Houseman later recalled visitors had to \\"wade knee-deep through a crackling sea of flammable [nitrate] film.\\"Brady, Frank,Citizen Welles: A Biography of Orson Welles. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1989 Welles was assisted by John Berry, who had been hired by the Mercury Theatre as an apprentice and extra for Caesar and worked with Welles on subsequent Mercury productions, including Too Much Johnson. Years later he recalled building the sets on a vacant lot in Yonkers, and organizing a crew that literally held them up against in the wind during filming. \\"Orson had a wonderful time making the film,\\" Berry said, reporting that Welles was so absorbed in the cutting that he took little note when the film caught fire in the projector. \\"What I remember, most remarkably, is me running with the projector in my hand, burning, trying to get out of the door into the goddamn hallway, and Houseman racing for the door at the same time ‚Ä¶ while Orson, with absolutely no concern whatsoever, was back inside, standing and looking at some piece of film in his hand, smoking his pipe.McGilligan, Patrick, Paul M. Buhle, Alison Morle, and William B. Winburn, Tender Comrades: A Backstory of the Hollywood Blacklist. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1997. During post-production, Welles ran into financial problems relating to his cast (who were not originally paid for the film shoot) and the film laboratory, which refused to deliver the processed film until it received payment. Welles also received an attorney's letter from Paramount Pictures informing him that the studio owned the film rights to Too Much Johnson, and that public presentation of his film would require payment to the studio. Welles initially planned to present the stage-and-film mix of Too Much Johnson at the Stony Creek Theatre in Connecticut as a pre-Broadway trial run, but discovered that the theater's ceiling was too low to allow for film projection. The show opened on August 16, 1938, without the filmed sequences. Most modern sources report that audience and critical reaction to the show was poor and caused Welles to abandon the production, but a search of press coverage at the time indicates no negative published reports and no reviews from major critics. The Branford Review reported that interest in the stage production was strong as it began its second week. Loss and rediscovery Welles never completed editing the film component for Too Much Johnson and put the footage in storage. He rediscovered it three decades later at his home outside of Madrid, Spain. \\"I can't remember whether I had it all along and dug it out of the bottom of a trunk, or whether someone brought it to me, but there it was\\", he later recalled. \\"I screened it, and it was in perfect condition, with not a scratch on it, as though it had only been through a projector once or twice before. It had a fine quality.\\" Welles, however, never allowed the footage to be seen publicly, stating the film would not make sense outside of the full context of the Gillette play. In August 1970,Welles, Orson, and Peter Bogdanovich, edited by Jonathan Rosenbaum, This is Orson Welles. New York: HarperCollins Publishers 1992 a fire broke out at Welles's villa and the only known complete print of Too Much Johnson was destroyed.Heylen, Clinton, Despite the System, Chicago Review Press, 2005 p 10. A copy was discovered in Italy in 2008, and on August 5, 2013, the George Eastman House museum of film and photography in the U.S. announced that it had completed a long process of restoration together with Cinemazero, the National Film Preservation Foundation, and laboratory experts in the U.S. and the Netherlands. Cinema Arts, a Pennsylvania film laboratory, performed most of the preservation work. \\"The next step was to begin the actual photo-chemical preservation\\", said Tony Delgrosso, Head of Preservation at George Eastman House. \\"For that we turned to a lab called Cinema Arts who are world famous for the quality of their black-and-white photo-chemical preservation and restoration.\\" Too Much Johnson premiered October 9, 2013, at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival. The film's North American premiere was held October 16, 2013, at George Eastman House's Dryden Theatre, and the film's New York City premiere took place on November 25, 2013, at the Directors Guild of America Theater. On August 21, 2014, the complete 66-minute work print of the film was posted online by the National Film Preservation Foundation. An edited version running about 34 minutes including intertitles, with new music composed and performed by Michael Mortilla, was also made available. \\"If this edit is only a guess, it strives to be an educated one,\\" stated the foundation, \\"informed by research into the unpublished play scripts left behind by Welles and the Mercury Theatre company.\\" On February 5, 2015, Too Much Johnson was screened and performed for the very first time as a complete stage performance at the Film Forum in New York City, in association with George Eastman House, as Welles originally intended. The filmed portions were shown as prologues to the play's three acts which were performed as a staged reading by the Film Forum Players. The staged reading was directed by Allen Lewis Rickman, who adapted the play from both the Welles and Gillette versions. It was produced by Bruce Goldstein. Steve Sterner composed and performed the soundtrack for the film. The footage was re-edited by William Hohauser to fit a coherent narrative structure in conjunction with the play. Sequences already edited by Welles were left intact.http://filmforum.org/film/too-much-johnson-special-event- film-feb-5 Reception Demand to see Too Much Johnson at its world premiere at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival warranted two additional showings. Reporting the \\"snaking queues outside the auditorium\\", The Guardian described the film as \\"a gleeful experiment in silent cinema pastiche\\": > And while it is a work print, not a finished film, Too Much Johnson offers > breathlessly enjoyable viewing. Joseph Cotten makes a tremendous movie debut > as the play's philandering lead, displaying unimagined guts and agility in a > series of tumbles and leaps across Manhattan rooftops, pursued by a > prancing, moustache-twirling Edgar Barrier. And Too Much Johnson is itself > an affectionate romp through Keystone two-reelers, Harold Lloyd's stunt > slapstick, European serials, Soviet montage and, notably, Welles's favoured > steep expressionist-influenced camera angles. Variety called the unedited footage \\"an unanticipated delight\\": > There are moments of ultra-broad comedy ‚Äî Arlene Francis, looking ravishing, > hams it up with evident delight at the start ‚Äî yet the outdoor footage, much > of it shot in the Meatpacking District and further south, is a delightful > spin on slapstick chase conventions, and a dashing Joseph Cotten, in Harold > Lloyd mode, demonstrates a remarkable lack of vertigo along with physical > grace. Genuinely funny rather than derivative, the film as seen, complete > with multiple takes, feels fresh and spirited up until the last section, > when scenes meant to take place in Cuba (but shot near the Hudson, with a > few rented palm trees) lose a bit of steam before the amusing final shots. Writing for Bright Lights Film Journal, film historian Joseph McBride categorizes Too Much Johnson as Welles's pre-Hollywood filmmaking experiment, > a youthful tribute not only to the spirited tradition of exuberant low > comedy but also to the past of the medium he was about to enter. Welles was > always enamored of the past, though more, he said, of the mythical past we > prefer to revere in fantasy than the actual messy past that was, e.g., > ‚ÄúMerrie Old England‚Äù and ‚ÄúCamelot‚Äù rather than the real England of those > days. He explores that theme in deeply personal ways in The Magnificent > Ambersons and Chimes at Midnight, and Too Much Johnson is also reflective of > his obsession with bygone times, cultural mores, and means of expression.

R. C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning. Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, 1993. C4.5 is an extension of Quinlan's earlier ID3 algorithm. The decision trees generated by C4.5 can be used for classification, and for this reason, C4.5 is often referred to as a statistical classifier. In 2011, authors of the Weka machine learning software described the C4.5 algorithm as \\"a landmark decision tree program that is probably the machine learning workhorse most widely used in practice to date\\". It became quite popular after ranking #1 in the Top 10 Algorithms in Data Mining pre-eminent paper published by Springer LNCS in 2008.Umd.edu - Top 10 Algorithms in Data Mining Algorithm C4.5 builds decision trees from a set of training data in the same way as ID3, using the concept of information entropy. The training data is a set S = {s_1, s_2, ...} of already classified samples. Each sample s_i consists of a p-dimensional vector (x_{1,i}, x_{2,i}, ...,x_{p,i}) , where the x_j represent attribute values or features of the sample, as well as the class in which s_i falls. At each node of the tree, C4.5 chooses the attribute of the data that most effectively splits its set of samples into subsets enriched in one class or the other. The splitting criterion is the normalized information gain (difference in entropy). The attribute with the highest normalized information gain is chosen to make the decision. The C4.5 algorithm then recurses on the partitioned sublists. This algorithm has a few base cases. *All the samples in the list belong to the same class. When this happens, it simply creates a leaf node for the decision tree saying to choose that class. *None of the features provide any information gain. In this case, C4.5 creates a decision node higher up the tree using the expected value of the class. *Instance of previously-unseen class encountered. Again, C4.5 creates a decision node higher up the tree using the expected value. =Pseudocode= In pseudocode, the general algorithm for building decision trees is:S.B. Kotsiantis, \\"Supervised Machine Learning: A Review of Classification Techniques\\", Informatica 31(2007) 249-268, 2007 #Check for the above base cases. #For each attribute a, find the normalized information gain ratio from splitting on a. #Let a_best be the attribute with the highest normalized information gain. #Create a decision node that splits on a_best. #Recurse on the sublists obtained by splitting on a_best, and add those nodes as children of node. Implementations J48 is an open source Java implementation of the C4.5 algorithm in the Weka data mining tool. Improvements from ID.3 algorithm C4.5 made a number of improvements to ID3. Some of these are: * Handling both continuous and discrete attributes - In order to handle continuous attributes, C4.5 creates a threshold and then splits the list into those whose attribute value is above the threshold and those that are less than or equal to it.J. R. Quinlan. Improved use of continuous attributes in c4.5. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 4:77-90, 1996. * Handling training data with missing attribute values - C4.5 allows attribute values to be marked as ? for missing. Missing attribute values are simply not used in gain and entropy calculations. * Handling attributes with differing costs. * Pruning trees after creation - C4.5 goes back through the tree once it's been created and attempts to remove branches that do not help by replacing them with leaf nodes. Improvements in C5.0/See5 algorithm Quinlan went on to create C5.0 and See5 (C5.0 for Unix/Linux, See5 for Windows) which he markets commercially. C5.0 offers a number of improvements on C4.5. Some of these are:Is See5/C5.0 Better Than C4.5?M. Kuhn and K. Johnson, Applied Predictive Modeling, Springer 2013 * Speed - C5.0 is significantly faster than C4.5 (several orders of magnitude) * Memory usage - C5.0 is more memory efficient than C4.5 * Smaller decision trees - C5.0 gets similar results to C4.5 with considerably smaller decision trees. * Support for boosting - Boosting improves the trees and gives them more accuracy. * Weighting - C5.0 allows you to weight different cases and misclassification types. * Winnowing - a C5.0 option automatically winnows the attributes to remove those that may be unhelpful.

For businesses organic growth typically excludes the impact of foreign exchange. \\"Core growth\\" is the term that is used to refer to growth that includes foreign exchange, but excludes divestitures and acquisitions. Organic business growth is growth that comes from a company's existing businesses, as opposed to growth that comes from buying new businesses. It may be negative. Through Growth planning, businesses are able to achieve organic growth by selecting the best strategies available to them. For example, by examining Ansoff's matrix, businesses can select from market penetration, market development, product development and diversification to grow their revenue organically. In addition, organic business growthcan be achieved utilizing content marketing efforts, which drive organic search traffic. Organic business growth does include growth over a period that results from investment in businesses the company owned at the beginning of the period. What it excludes is the boost to growth from acquisitions, and the decline from sales and closures of whole businesses. When a company does not disclose organic growth numbers, it is usually possible to estimate them by estimating the numbers for acquisitions made in the period being looked at and in the previous year. It is useful to break down organic sales growth into that coming from market growth and that coming from gains in market share: this makes it easier to see how sustainable growth is. Relating to organic input in an organisation, it can also relate to the act of closing down cost centers through established organic methods instead of waiting for a Finance list. The mechanisms and rate of growth of firms experiencing organic growth was extensively studied by Edith Penrose in her 1958 book The Theory of the Growth of the Firm.http://moneyterms.co.uk/organic_growth/ An early reference to \\"organic growth\\" appeared in Inazo Nitobe's 1899 book The Soul of Japan.

Jeanette Nolan co-stars as Lady Macbeth. Production In 1947, Orson Welles began promoting the notion of bringing a Shakespeare drama to the motion picture screen. He initially attempted to pique Alexander Korda's interest in an adaptation of Othello, but was unable to gather support for the project. Welles switched to pushing for a film adaptation of Macbeth, which he visualized in its violent setting as \\"a perfect cross between Wuthering Heights and Bride of Frankenstein.\\" Teaming with producer Charles K. Feldman, Welles successfully convinced Herbert Yates, founder and president of Republic Pictures, of the prospect of creating a film version of Macbeth. Yates was attempting to raise the level of his studio, which produced Roy Rogers Westerns and low-budget features, into that of a prestige studio. Republic had already tried to present off-beat features, including Gustav Machat√Ω's Jealousy (1945) and Ben Hecht's Specter of the Rose (1946). However, Yates was not able to provide Welles with a large budget. Welles guaranteed to deliver a completed negative of Macbeth on a budget of $700,000. When some members of the Republic board of directors expressed misgivings on the project, Welles had a contract drawn in which he agreed to personally pay any amount over $700,000. Welles had previously staged the so-called Voodoo Macbeth in 1936 in New York City with an all-black cast, and again in 1947 in Salt Lake City as part of the Utah Centennial Festival. He borrowed aspects from both productions for his film adaptation. Macbeth marked the fourth time that a post-silent era Hollywood studio produced a film based on a Shakespeare play: United Artists had produced The Taming of the Shrew in 1929, Warner Brothers made A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream in 1935, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer produced Romeo and Juliet in 1936. None of these films was commercially successful, but the commercial and critical prestige earned by Laurence Olivier's film version of Henry V (which was produced in Great Britain in 1944 but not seen in the U.S. until 1946) helped to propel Welles' Macbeth forward.  Casting  Welles cast himself in the title role, but was initially stymied in casting Lady Macbeth, regarded by Republic as the focus of the film. His first choice was Vivien Leigh, but Welles never approached her since he believed her husband, Laurence Olivier, would be unsupportive. The role was offered to Tallulah Bankhead, who turned it down. At Welles's request Anne Baxter, Mercedes McCambridge and Agnes Moorehead were approached but they were unavailable. \\"There is no evidence to suggest that these rejections were much of a blow to Welles,\\" wrote biographer Frank Brady. Welles settled on Jeanette Nolan, one of the Mercury Theatre's repertory players on radio and a trusted colleague since their days on The March of Time radio program. Welles brought in Irish actor Dan O'Herlihy in his first U.S. film role as Macduff, and cast former child star Roddy McDowall as Malcolm. Welles also cast his daughter Christopher in the role of Macduff's son; this was her only film appearance. Cast The cast of Macbeth is listed in the AFI Catalog of Feature Films. *Orson Welles as Macbeth *Jeanette Nolan as Lady Macbeth *Dan O'Herlihy as Macduff *Roddy McDowall as Malcolm *Edgar Barrier as Banquo *Alan Napier as A Holy Father *Erskine Sanford as Duncan *John Dierkes as Ross *Keene Curtis as Lennox *Peggy Webber as Lady Macduff and Witch *Lionel Braham as Siward *Archie Heugly as Siward *Jerry Farber as Fleance *Christopher Welles as Macduff's child *Morgan Farley as Doctor *Lurene Tuttle as Gentlewoman and Witch *Brainerd Duffield as First Murderer and Witch *William Alland as Second Murderer *George Chirello as Seyton *Gus Schilling as A porter *Robert Alan as Third Murderer (uncredited) *Harry Wilson as Banquet Guest (uncredited) Adaptation In bringing Macbeth to the screen, Welles made several changes to Shakespeare's original. He added sequences involving the witches to increase their significance. At the beginning of the film, they create a clay figurine of Macbeth, which is used to symbolize his rise and ruin. It collapses in a heap, seemingly of its own volition, immediately after Macbeth is beheaded. The witches seem to cast a spell on the doll, and anything that happens to it seems to happen also to Macbeth, as in voodoo. The witches also return at the end of the film, viewing the drama from afar and uttering \\"Peace, the charm's wound up\\" as the final line; this line is spoken in the first act in the original text, when the witches initially confront Macbeth. Because of censorship, the Porter's speech was shorn of all its double entendre. A major change is Welles' introduction of a new character, the Holy Man. The priest recites the prayer of Saint Michael. Welles later explained that the character's presence was meant to confirm that \\"the main point of that production is the struggle between the old and new religions. I saw the witches as representatives of a Druidical pagan religion suppressed by Christianity ‚Äì itself a new arrival.\\" There is a subtle insinuation that Lady Macbeth fatally stabs Duncan prior to Macbeth's attack on the king, and Macbeth is witness to Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking and madness scene; in the play, he is not present. Other changes were made to make the play more cinematic. Nearly all of King Duncan's scenes at the beginning of the play have been cut as well as the character of Donalbain, his second son. Macbeth is seen dictating his letter to his wife, rather than writing it himself. In the play, no such dictation scene exists. The Thane of Cawdor's execution takes place on-screen accompanied by insistent drumbeats. Lady Macbeth's suicide and the final battle between Macbeth's forces and Macduff's army are depicted on-screen; in the play, both scenes occur off-stage. Rather than fatally stabbing Macbeth and then beheading the dead body, Macduff kills Macbeth by slashing off his head. Needless to say, lines have been cut, speeches have been reassigned, scenes have been reordered, etc. This scandalized many critics at the time; today it is accepted practice to do so in film versions of Shakespeare plays to an even greater degree than Welles did, as Jean-Luc Godard did in his highly unusual and controversial King Lear, and as Peter Greenaway did in Prospero's Books. Filming The film was shot on leftover sets for the westerns that were normally made at Republic Studios. In order to accommodate the tight production schedule, Welles had the Macbeth cast pre-record their dialogue. Welles later expressed frustration with the film's low budget trappings. Most of the costumes were rented from Western Costume, except those for Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. \\"Mine should have been sent back, because I looked like the Statue of Liberty in it,\\" Welles told filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich. \\"But there was no dough for another and nothing in stock at Western would fit me, so I was stuck with it.\\" Welles also told Bogdanovich that the scene he felt was most effective was actually based on hunger. \\"Our best crowd scene was a shot where all the massed forces of Macduff's army are charging the castle\\", he said. \\"There was a very vivid urgency to it, because what was happening, really, was that we'd just called noon break, and all those extras were rushing off to lunch.\\" Welles shot Macbeth in 23 days, with one day devoted to retakes. Release and reception Republic initially planned to have Macbeth in release by December 1947, but Welles was not ready with the film. The studio entered the film in the 1948 Venice Film Festival, but it was abruptly withdrawn when it was compared unfavorably against Olivier's version of Hamlet, which was also in the festival's competition. In the U.S. theatrical release, Republic tested the film in a few cities. Critical reaction was overwhelmingly negative, with complaints about Welles's decision to have his cast speak in Scottish burrs and modify the original text. After its original release, Republic had Welles cut two reels from the film and ordered him to have much of the soundtrack re- recorded with the actors speaking in their natural voices, and not the approximation of Scottish accents that Welles initially requested. This new version was released by Republic in 1950. While critical reaction was still not supportive, the film earned a small profit for the studio. Welles would maintain mixed emotions about Macbeth. In a 1953 lecture at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, he said: \\"My purpose in making Macbeth was not to make a great film ‚Äì and this is unusual, because I think that every film director, even when he is making nonsense, should have as his purpose the making of a great film. I thought I was making what might be a good film, and what, if the 23-day day shoot schedule came off, might encourage other filmmakers to tackle difficult subjects at greater speed. Unfortunately, not one critic in any part of the world chose to compliment me on the speed. They thought it was a scandal that it should only take 23 days. Of course, they were right, but I could not write to every one of them and explain that no one would give me any money for a further day's shooting . . . However, I am not ashamed of the limitations of the picture.\\" The truncated version of Macbeth remained in release until 1980, when the original uncut version with the Scottish-tinged soundtrack was restored by the UCLA Film and Television Archive and the Folger Shakespeare Library. Critical opinion of the film has drastically improved since its original release, with many now regarding it as one of Welles' most notable films. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 7.52/10. The site's critics' consensus reads: \\"This haunting, eccentric Macbeth may be hampered by budget constraints, but Orson Welles delivers both behind and in front of the camera.\\" References =Sources=      External links  * Category:1948 films Category:1940s historical drama films Category:American films Category:American historical drama films Category:English-language films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films based on Macbeth Category:Republic Pictures films Category:Films directed by Orson Welles Category:Films with screenplays by Orson Welles Category:Films scored by Jacques Ibert ","title":"Macbeth (1948 film)"},{"id":"1966829","text":"Numbering plan area of Georgia. NPA 404 os shown in purple. Area code 404 is a telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for Atlanta, Georgia and its closest suburbs. This comprises roughly the area encircled by Interstate 285. It is an enclave area code, completely surrounded by area code 770, which serves most of Atlanta's suburbs. Both 404 and 770 are overlaid by area codes 678 and 470. History Area code 404 was created in 1947 as one the original numbering plan areas in North America, serving the entire state of Georgia. On July 1, 1954, the area from Macon southward was split off as area code 912. Area code 404 was reduced to the northern half of the state, from the Tennessee and North Carolina borders as far south as Columbus and Augusta. Despite Atlanta's growth in the 1970s and 1980s, 404 remained unchanged for 38 years. However, by the end of the 1980s, 404 was on the brink of exhaustion. In an effort to delay splitting the area code, Southern Bell (later BellSouth, now part of AT&T; Inc.) decided to introduce interchangeable central office codes, effective October, 1 1989.NANPA, BellCore Information Letter IL-89/02-014 (1989-02-06) Previously, the 404 numbering plan served 640 central offices. but the addition of interchangeable codes increased its capacity to 792 central offices in the numbering plan area. As a result, north Georgia telephone subscribers were forced to dial 1 plus the full ten-digit number (area code plus number). By late 1991, the need for a new area code could no longer be staved off. On May 3, 1992, nearly all of the old 404 territory outside of metro Atlanta was split off with area code 706.NANPA Information Letter 91-10-058 However, shortly after the split took effect, residents in several exurbs of Atlanta complained about no longer being associated with 404. As a result, BellSouth returned these areas to 404 in the spring of 1993.NANPA Information Letter 93-04-016 The 404/706 boundary was redrawn in a way that left Columbus and its surrounding area cut off from the rest of 706, making 706 one of the few area codes that are not contiguous. BellSouth and the Georgia Public Service Commission knew that 404 was still close to exhaustion even after the creation of 706 due to the growing proliferation of cell phones, fax machines and pagers. Indeed, the GPSC had anticipated that the Atlanta area would eventually need another area code, and had planned to assign 770 to Atlanta's suburbs later in the decade. However, the decision to return the Atlanta exurbs to 404 forced the GPSC to shift nearly all of Atlanta's suburban ring to 770 on August 1, 1995, sooner than had been planned. The 404/770 boundary roughly follows Interstate 285, locally known as \\"the Perimeter.\\" Generally, 404 is Atlanta itself and most suburbs inside the Perimeter (such as Decatur), while most of the metro area outside the Perimeter uses 770. The boundary was drawn in such a way that a number of areas are split between the two codes. For some time after the 770 split, 404 continued to be used for all cellphones in metro Atlanta. 404/770 became one of the six pairs of \\"doughnut area codes\\" in the numbering plan. The 1995 split was intended as a long-term solution. However, within two years both 404 and 770 were close to exhaustion due to Atlanta's explosive growth and the continued proliferation of cellphones and pagers. On January 1, 1998, area code 678 was introduced as an overlay area code for 404 and 770. Since then, ten-digit dialing has been mandatory throughout metro Atlanta. Because the Federal Communications Commission would not allow an area code to apply only to cellphones, mobile customers throughout the metro area were given the option of choosing numbers in the 404, 770 and 678 area codes when signing up for service. Within only two years, it was apparent that a fourth area code was needed for metro Atlanta. On September 2, 2001, area code 470 was overlaid on top of the 404, 770, and 678 area codes. When telephone numbers in area code 678 are exhausted, 470-numbers will be assigned. The number was chosen by the Georgia Public Service Commission and approved by the NANPA, as were the previous splits and overlays for new area codes in the state. This has the effect of allocating 31.2 million numbers to a metropolitan area of 6.4 million people. Telephone numbers for high-capacity lines, such as for contest lines for radio stations, are assigned with the central office prefix 741. When 770 was split, these numbers continued to work as both 404-741-xxxx and as 770-741-xxxx, so that only seven-digit dialing was necessary. That lasted until 678 came into use. There are also other prefixes that are not assigned to just one exchange, such as 499 and 528 used by Cobb County government and formerly SPSU. These were completely moved into 770. In November 2013, the NANPA announced the exhaustion of available number blocks for area code 404, citing significant population growth in Atlanta. Counties served Area code 404 serves landlines and cellphones in portions of Clayton, DeKalb and Fulton counties, as well as cellphones in portions of Cobb, Douglas and Gwinnett counties. All are shared with area code 770. The entire metro Atlanta region (404, 770, 678/470 and parts of 706/762) is a local calling area, one of the largest in the United States; no long-distance charges are applied for calls from one part of the region to the other.

The bacterium is referred to as a coccus because it is round, and more specifically, diplococcus because of its tendency to form pairs. About 10% of adults are carriers of the bacteria in their nasopharynx.Hitchcock P.J., Robinson E.N. (Jr.) and McGee Z.A., \\"Neisseriae: Gonococcus and Meningococcus\\", chap. 14 in Schaechter M., Medoff G. and Eisenstein B.I., Mechanisms of Microbial Disease, 2nd Ed., Baltimore, Williams & Wilkins, 1993., p.231. As an exclusively human pathogen it is the main cause of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults, causing developmental impairment and death in about 10% of cases. It causes the only form of bacterial meningitis known to occur epidemically, mainly in Africa and Asia. It occurs worldwide in both epidemic and endemic form. N. meningitidis is spread through saliva and respiratory secretions during coughing, sneezing, kissing, chewing on toys and even through sharing a source of fresh water. It has also been reported to be transmitted through oral sex and cause urethritis in men. It infects its host cells by sticking to them with long thin extensions called pili and the surface-exposed proteins Opa and Opc and has several virulence factors. Signs and symptoms Meningococcus can cause meningitis and other forms of meningococcal disease. It initially produces general symptoms like fatigue, fever, and headache and can rapidly progress to neck stiffness, coma and death in 10% of cases. Petechiae occur in about 50% of cases. Chance of survival is highly correlated with blood cortisol levels, and so a reduction in cortisol can be used to determine likelihood of patient mortality.Critical Care Medicine. 27(10):2257-2261, OCTOBER 1999 Symptoms of meningococcal meningitis are easily confused with those caused by other bacteria, such as Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Suspicion of meningitis is a medical emergency and immediate medical assessment is recommended. Current guidance in the United Kingdom is that if a case of meningococcal meningitis or septicaemia (infection of the blood) is suspected, intravenous antibiotics should be given and the ill person admitted to the hospital. This means that laboratory tests may be less likely to confirm the presence of Neisseria meningitidis as the antibiotics will dramatically lower the number of bacteria in the body. The UK guidance is based on the idea that the reduced ability to identify the bacteria is outweighed by reduced chance of death. Septicaemia caused by Neisseria meningitidis has received much less public attention than meningococcal meningitis even though septicaemia has been linked to infant deaths. Meningococcal septicaemia typically causes a purpuric rash, that does not lose its color when pressed with a glass slide (\\"non-blanching\\") and does not cause the classical symptoms of meningitis. This means the condition may be ignored by those not aware of the significance of the rash. Septicaemia carries an approximate 50% mortality rate over a few hours from initial onset. Other severe complications include Waterhouse‚ÄìFriderichsen syndrome, a massive, usually bilateral, hemorrhage into the adrenal glands caused by fulminant meningococcemia, adrenal insufficiency, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Not all instances of a purpura-like rash are due to meningococcal septicaemia; other possible causes, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP; a platelet disorder) and Henoch‚ÄìSch√∂nlein purpura, also need prompt investigation.  Microbiology  N. meningitidis is a Gram-negative diplococcus since it has an outer and inner membranes with a thin layer of peptidoglycan in between. It is 0.6‚Äì1.0 micrometers in size. It tests positive for the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. =Habitat= N. meningitidis is a part of the normal nonpathogenic flora in the nasopharynx of up to 5‚Äì15% of adults. It colonizes and infects only humans, and has never been isolated from other animals. This is thought to stem from the bacterium's inability to get iron from sources other than human transferrin and lactoferrin. = Subtypes = Disease-causing strains are classified according to the antigenic structure of their polysaccharide capsule.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Meningococcal Disease, Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, 13th Ed., April, 2015. Serotype distribution varies markedly around the world. Among the 13 identified capsular types of N. meningitidis, six (A, B, C, W135, X, and Y) account for most disease cases worldwide. Type A has been the most prevalent in Africa and Asia, but is rare/practically absent in North America. In the United States, serogroup B is the predominant cause of disease and mortality, followed by serogroup C. The multiple subtypes have hindered development of a universal vaccine for meningococcal disease.  Pathogenesis  = Virulence = Lipooligosaccharide (LOS) is a component of the outer membrane of N. meningitidis. This acts as an endotoxin and is responsible for septic shock and hemorrhage due to the destruction of red blood cells. Other virulence factors include a polysaccharide capsule which prevents host phagocytosis and aids in evasion of the host immune response; fimbriae mediate attachment of the bacterium to the epithelial cells of the nasopharynx. It infects the cell by sticking to it mainly with long thin extensions called pili and the surface-exposed proteins Opa and Opc. Meningococci produce an IgA protease, an enzyme that cleaves IgA class antibodies and thus allows the bacteria to evade a subclass of the humoral immune system. A hypervirulent strain was discovered in China. Its impact is yet to be determined. =Complement inhibition= Factor H binding protein (fHbp) that is exhibited in N. meningitidis and some commensal species is the main inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway. fHbp protects meningococci from complement-mediated death in human serum experiments, but has also been shown to protect meningococci from antimicrobial peptides in vitro. Factor H binding protein is key to the pathogenesis of N. meningitidis, and is, therefore, important as a potential vaccine candidate. Porins are also an important factor for complement inhibition for both pathogenic and commensal species. Porins are important for nutrient acquisition. Porins are also recognized by TLR2, they bind complement factors (C3b, C4b, factor H, and C4bp (complement factor 4b-binding protein)). Cooperation with pili for CR3-mediated internalization is another function of porins. Ability to translocate into host cells and modulate reactive oxygen species production and apoptosis is made possible by porins, as well. Strains of the same species can express different porins.  Genome  At least 8 complete genomes of Neisseria meningitidis strains have been determined which encode about 2,100 to 2,500 proteins. The genome of strain MC58 (serogroup B) has 2,272,351-base pairs. When sequenced in 2000, it was found to contain 2158 open reading frames (ORFs). Of these, a biological function was predicted for 1158 (53.7%). There were three major islands of horizontal DNA transfer found. Two encode proteins involved in pathogenicity. The third island only codes for hypothetical proteins. They also found more genes that undergo phase variation than any pathogen then known. Phase variation is a mechanism that helps the pathogen to evade the immune system of the host. The genome size of strain H44/76 is 2.18 Mb, and encodes 2,480 open reading frames (ORFs), compared to 2.27 Mb and 2,465 ORFs for MC58. Both strains have a GC content of 51.5%. A comparison with MC58 showed that four genes are uniquely present in H44/76 and nine genes are only present in MC58. Of all ORFs in H44/76, 2,317 (93%) show more than 99% sequence identity. The complete genome sequence of strain NMA510612 (serogroup A) consists of one circular chromosome with a size of 2,188,020 bp, and the average GC content is 51.5%. The chromosome is predicted to possess 4 rRNA operons, 163 insertion elements (IS), 59 tRNAs, and 2,462 ORFs. Genetic transformation Genetic transformation is the process by which a recipient bacterial cell takes up DNA from a neighboring cell and integrates this DNA into the recipient‚Äôs genome by recombination. In N. meningitidis, DNA transformation requires the presence of short DNA sequences (9‚Äì10 mers residing in coding regions) of the donor DNA. These sequences are called DNA uptake sequences (DUSs). Specific recognition of these sequences is mediated by a type IV pilin. In N. meningitidis DUSs occur at a significantly higher density in genes involved in DNA repair and recombination (as well as in restriction-modification and replication) than in other annotated gene groups. The over-representation of DUS in DNA repair and recombination genes may reflect the benefit of maintaining the integrity of the DNA repair and recombination machinery by preferentially taking up genome maintenance genes, that could replace their damaged counterparts in the recipient cell. N. meningititis colonizes the nasopharyngeal mucosa, which is rich in macrophages. Upon their activation, macrophages produce superoxide (O2¬Ø) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Thus N. meningitidis is likely to encounter oxidative stress during its life cycle. Consequently, an important benefit of genetic transformation to N. meningitidis may be the maintenance of the recombination and repair machinery of the cell that removes oxidative DNA damages such as those caused by reactive oxygen. This is consistent with the more general idea that transformation benefits bacterial pathogens by facilitating repair of DNA damages produced by the oxidative defenses of the host during infection. Diagnosis The growth of Neisseria meningitidis colonies on New York City agar Neisseria meningitidis in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) seen by Gram stain at 1000x magnification With a fatality risk approaching 15% within 12 hours of infection, it is crucial to initiate testing as quickly as possible, but not to wait for the results before initiating antibiotic therapy. A small amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is sent to the laboratory as soon as possible for analysis. The diagnosis is suspected, when Gram-negative diplococci are seen on Gram stain of a centrifuged sample of CSF; sometimes they are located inside white blood cells. The microscopic identification takes around 1‚Äì2 hours after specimen arrival in the laboratory. The gold standard of diagnosis is microbiological isolation of N. meningitidis by growth from a sterile body fluid, which could be CSF or blood. Diagnosis is confirmed when the organism has grown, most often on a chocolate agar plate, but also on Thayer-Martin agar. To differentiate any bacterial growth from other species a small amount of a bacterial colony is tested for oxidase, catalase for which all clinically relevant Neisseria show a positive reaction, and the carbohydrates maltose, sucrose, and glucose, in which N. meningitidis will ferment that is, utilize the glucose and maltose. Finally, serology determines the subgroup of the N. meningitidis, which is important for epidemiological surveillance purposes; this may often only be done in specialized laboratories. The above tests take a minimum of 48‚Äì72 hours turnaround time for growing the organism, and up to a week more for serotyping. Growth can and often does fail, either because antibiotics have been given preemptively, or because specimens have been inappropriately transported, as the organism is extremely susceptible to antibiotics and fastidious in its temperature, and growth medium requirements. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests where available, mostly in industrialized countries, have been increasingly used; PCR can rapidly identify the organism, and works even after antibiotics have been given.  Prevention  All recent contacts of the infected patient over the 7 days before onset should receive medication to prevent them from contracting the infection. This especially includes young children and their child caregivers or nursery-school contacts, as well as anyone who had direct exposure to the patient through kissing, sharing utensils, or medical interventions such as mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Anyone who frequently ate, slept or stayed at the patient's home during the 7 days before the onset of symptom, or those who sat beside the patient on an airplane flight or classroom for 8 hours or longer, should also receive chemoprophylaxis. The agent of choice is usually oral rifampicin for a few days. Receiving a dose of the Meningococcal vaccine before traveling to a country in the \\"meningitis belt\\" or having a booster meningitis vaccine, normally five years apart could prevent someone from getting an infection from the pathogen. =Vaccination= United States A number of vaccines are available in the U.S. to prevent meningococcal disease. Some of the vaccines cover serogroup B, while others cover A, C, W, and Y. A meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) has been available since the 1970s and is the only meningococcal vaccine licensed for people older than 55. MPSV4 may be used in people 2‚Äì55 years old if the MCV4 vaccines are not available or contraindicated. Two meningococcal conjugate vaccines (MCV4) are licensed for use in the U.S. The first conjugate vaccine was licensed in 2005, the second in 2010. Conjugate vaccines are the preferred vaccine for people 2 through 55 years of age. It is indicated in those with impaired immunity, such as nephrotic syndrome or splenectomy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes information about who should receive meningococcal vaccine. In June 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a combination vaccine against two types of meningococcal diseases and Hib disease for infants and children 6 weeks to 18 months old. The vaccine, Menhibrix, was designed to prevent disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups C and Y, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). It was the first meningococcal vaccine that could be given to infants as young as six weeks old. In October 2014 the FDA approved the first vaccine effective against serogroup B, named Trumenba, for use in 10- to 25-year-old individuals. Africa In 2010, the Meningitis Vaccine Project introduced a vaccine called MenAfriVac in the African meningitis belt. It was made by generic drug maker Serum Institute of India and cost 50 U.S. cents per injection. Beginning in Burkina Faso in 2010, it has been given to 215 million people across Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, Togo and Gambia. The vaccination campaign has resulted in near-elimination of serogroup A meningitis from the participating countries.  Treatment  Persons with confirmed N. meningitidis infection should be hospitalized immediately for treatment with antibiotics. Because meningococcal disease can disseminate very rapidly, a single dose of intramuscular antibiotic is often given at the earliest possible opportunity, even before hospitalization, if disease symptoms look suspicious enough. Third-generation cephalosporin antibiotics (i.e. cefotaxime, ceftriaxone) should be used to treat a suspected or culture-proven meningococcal infection before antibiotic susceptibility results are available. Empirical treatment should also be considered if a lumbar puncture, to collect CSF for laboratory testing, cannot be done within 30 minutes of admission to hospital.Vall√©s J., Ferrer R. y Fern√°ndez-Viladrich P., \\"Bloodstream infections including Endocarditis and Meningitis\\", chap. 16 in Hendrik K.F, Van Saene H.K.F., Silvestri L. y Cal M.A. (eds.), Infection Control in the Intensive Care Unit,, Springer Science & Business Media, 2005, 639 pp. .Acute Management of Suspected Meningococcal Disease Clinical Pathway , State of Queensland (Queensland Health) 2012. Antibiotic treatment may affect the results of microbiology tests, but a diagnosis may be made on the basis of blood-cultures and clinical examination. Epidemiology N. meningitidis is a major cause of illness, developmental impairment and death during childhood in industrialized countries and has been responsible for epidemics in Africa and in Asia. Every year, about 2,500 to 3,500 people become infected with N. meningitidis in the US, with a frequency of about 1 in 100,000. Children younger than 5 years are at greatest risk, followed by teenagers of high school age. Rates in the African meningitis belt were as high as 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 100 before introduction of a vaccine in 2010. The incidence of meningococcal disease is highest among infants (children younger than 1-year-old) whose immune system is relatively immature. In industrialized countries there is a second peak of incidence in young adults, who are congregating closely, living in dormitories or smoking. Vaccine development is ongoing. It is spread through saliva and other respiratory secretions during coughing, sneezing, kissing, and chewing on toys. Inhalation of respiratory droplets from a carrier which may be someone who is themselves in the early stages of disease can transmit the bacteria. Close contact with a carrier is the predominant risk factor. Other risk factors include a weakened general or local immune response, such as a recent upper respiratory infection, smoking, and complement deficiency. The incubation period is short, from 2 to 10 days. In susceptible individuals, N. meningitidis may invade the bloodstream and cause a systemic infection, sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, breakdown of circulation, and septic shock. History In 1884 Ettore Marchiafava and Angelo Celli first observed the bacterium inside cells in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). In 1887 Anton Weichselbaum isolated the bacterium from the CSF of patients with bacterial meningitis. He named the bacterium Diplococcus intracellularis meningitidis.

Intourist was responsible for managing the great majority of foreigners' access to, and travel within, the Soviet Union. In 1933, the president of Intourist, Wilhelm Kurz, a member of the Central Committee of the Soviet Union, was the first Soviet official to visit the United States after the U.S. granted recognition to the Soviet Union.

The progressive rock epic lasts 20:35. It was the longest studio song by the band until the three impressions of \\"Karn Evil 9\\". The name \\"Tarkus\\" refers to the armadillo-tank from the William Neal paintings on the album cover. The artist has explained that the name is an amalgamation between 'Tartarus' and 'carcass' (hence the name being written in bones on the album cover). Consequently, the name refers to the \\"futility of war, a man made mess with symbols of mutated destruction.\\" The song \\"Tarkus\\" itself supposedly follows the adventures of Tarkus from his birth, through a fight with a manticore, which he loses and concludes with an aquatic version of Tarkus named \\"Aquatarkus\\". Keith Emerson, when asked what work he is proudest of, named his Piano Concerto (from the Works release) and Tarkus.

The \\"Mass\\" is often thought to be a mixture of a lizard, grasshopper and a rocket launcher. *This is followed by \\"Manticore\\" in which the final enemy of Tarkus appears and a battle ensues between variations on the \\"Tarkus\\" theme and the Manticore's. Ultimately, Tarkus is defeated and \\"Battlefield\\" follows. *The movement \\"Battlefield\\" is the only part written entirely by Greg Lake. *\\"Aquatarkus\\" closes the track, centering mostly on a march based on the \\"Battlefield\\" theme and then returning to the original \\"Eruption\\" theme as a farewell to Tarkus and a greeting to the aquatic Aquatarkus. Production According to Emerson, while Palmer was excited by some of the technical opportunities the song would present, Lake was not quite so enamoured, telling Emerson \\"If you want to play that sort of stuff, I suggest you play it on your solo album.\\" The band almost broke up over the issue, Emerson telling Lake \\"Take it or leave it.\\" The managers convinced Lake to stay and record the piece.Emerson, Lake & Palmer, \\"Story Of The Band,\\" Beyond the Beginning, Sanctuary Records, DVD, Release Date: August 16, 2005 Lake evidently did have the album grow on him, stating in an interview after the release: \\"It's about the futility of conflict expressed in [the] context [...] of soldiers and war. But it's broader than that. The words are about revolution that's gone, that has happened. Where has it got anybody? Nowhere.\\" He has also complimented \\"Stones of Years\\" as one of his favourite parts of \\"Tarkus\\". Lake admits to not being entirely sure of what it means, but says it is about, \\"listening, understanding, hearing.\\" When asked how Tarkus could be written so quickly (six days), Emerson said: > Our sort of creativity comes in varying periods. We get long periods when > there isn't any creativity, we go into a studio and nothing sounds right, > you know. Tarkus was written in six days because there was an awful lot of > inspiration and one idea triggered another idea, and it was a long series of > ideas being triggered off of what we had already done. Reception The song, described by one journalist to be \\"about a post- apocalyptic, metal-plated, bionic armadillo outfitted with enough weaponry to wage perpetual solo warfare,\\" remains a fan favourite and was consistently played at ELP, Keith Emerson Band and Carl Palmer band concerts. \\"Stones of Years\\" was used as a single from \\"Tarkus\\". The album as a whole reached number 1 on UK charts and number 9 in the US. Emerson, Lake & Palmer played a 27-minute version of Tarkus on Welcome Back, My Friends, to the Show That Never Ends... Ladies and Gentlemen, Emerson, Lake & Palmer. A brief sample of King Crimson's \\"Epitaph\\" (\\"Confusion will be my epitaph, as I crawl a cracked and broken path, if we make it we can all sit back and laugh...\\") appears as a coda to Battlefield, followed by Aquatarkus and an extended solo by Emerson. Other recordings In 2004, the Japanese classical pianist Aki Kuroda released an album with a classical adaptation of \\"Tarkus\\". In 2007, Dream Theater keyboardist Jordan Rudess included a cover of this song in his solo album The Road Home, which consists mostly of covers of classic progressive rock songs. Emerson recorded a new instrumental version with Marc Bonilla, Terje Mikkelsen and the Munich Radio Orchestra, which appears on their 2012 album Three Fates under the title Tarkus ‚Äì Concertante.

It was later re-released on home media (and is more widely known) under the shorter title Emperor of the North, ostensibly chosen by studio executives to avoid being mistaken for a heartwarming holiday story. This original title is a homage to the historic joke among Great Depression-era hobos that the world's best hobo was \\"Emperor of the North Pole\\", a way of poking fun at their own desperate situation, implying that somebody ruling over the North Pole would reign over nothing but a vast, barren, cold, empty, and stark wasteland. The film depicts the story of two hobos' struggle (esp. vs. \\"The Establishment\\") during the US' Great Depression in 1930s Oregon. Its screenplay is quite significantly inspired by three separate, yet inter- related self-published seminal writings from earlier decades: Jack London's better-known 1907 travel memoir, The Road, and, two lesser-known books, both by legendary hobo \\"A-No.-1\\", pen-name of Leon Ray Livingston, The Trail of the Tramp (1913), and his 1917 travelogue, From Coast to Coast with Jack London. Carradine's character, Cigaret, uses the moniker that Jack London used during his hobo escapades, and like London, is portrayed as a young traveling companion to the older Livingston's A-No.-1 (played by Marvin), but that is where (some assert) the similarity between Carradine's character and Jack London ends, as Cigaret is portrayed in the film as immature, loud-mouthed, and not bright, opposite A-No.-1's gracious and graceful seasoned veteran. Plot Shack (Ernest Borgnine) is a merciless, inhumane, and sadistic bully, a dedicated Company Man/Railroad conductor on the Oregon, Pacific and Eastern Railroad, during the Great Depression. He takes it upon himself to ensure that no one ever rides his freight train, the #19, for free, and that anyone who attempts, literally dies trying. Shack has an arsenal of makeshift weapons: several differently-sized hammers, a steel coupler pin tied to the end of a length of rope, a 4-6' chain, and a high pressure steam hose from the locomotive, all wielded with brute force. During the opening credits, he hammers a hobo on the head whom he's found riding between two cars, causing the \\"bo\\" to fall down under the cars and be cut in two by the train's wheels. A hobo who is a hero to his peers, A-No.-1 (Lee Marvin) manages to hop the train, and the younger, less-experienced Cigaret (Keith Carradine) secretly coattails him closely behind, only to be unwittingly seen by Shack, who then locks them inside the car from outside, sealing their exit. Upon realizing their plight, A-No.-1 sets fire to the onboard hay load as a means to exit 'under cover' from the wooden livestock car in which he and Cigaret are now trapped. As Shack directs the crew to stop the train in an approaching rail yard to have yard workers help extinguish the fire and then catch his stowaways, A-No.-1 evades them all, escapes to the hobo jungle, greets his old pal Smile (Liam Dunn), who, in turn, rouses, and declares to the assembled huddle that \\"A-No.-1 is \\"King of The Road, having just arrived on the 19!\\". Meanwhile, Cigaret is caught by laborers back at the rail yard, who then brags to them (Vic Tayback, Matt Clark, Hal Baylor, and others) that he was the one who rode Shack's train and that the other tramp got them caught, and burned to death in the fire. Most of the workers believe him, and they dispatch another \\"bo\\" to spread the word back at the Hobo Jungle that Cigaret is the one who finally beat Shack. When this tramp arrives in the hobo jungle to spread the word, A-No.-1 is there, and is confronted with the story that the young braggart Cigaret is taking credit for his deed. Indignant, A-No.-1 determines to ride Shack's train all the way to Portland to prove that only he is capable of such a bold act. He has another young tenderfoot hobo tag his intention high up on the yard water tower, where everyone can see it. When word of this posting rapidly arrives back in the train shed, Shack is in the process of strangling Cigaret for daring to claim he has ridden Shack's train. Forgotten by the yard workers in their excitement over whether A-No.-1 will succeed, Cigaret quietly slips out unnoticed. The other hobos agree that the first who can successfully ride Shack's train will have earned the title \\"Emperor of the North Pole.\\" Railroad workers place bets whether A-No.-1 can do it, spreading the news up and down the line by telephone and telegraph, Shack being widely known and disliked. The next morning is foggy. One of the hobos picks the lock on a switch so that Shack's train, Number 19, will be shunted onto a branch linesiding, making it easier for A-No.-1 to board. A-No.-1 unhitches the engine and tender from the freight cars to keep Shack further at bay, and Shack yells to A-No.-1 (now hiding back in the foggy woods) that this prank might cost 10 lives when the fast mail train comes through in just a few minutes. A-No.-1 challenges this as merely \\"a ghost story.\\" Hogger (the engineer), Coaly (the stoker), and Shack desperately get the train going again, and they barely succeed in getting it onto a siding, narrowly avoiding a catastrophic collision with the mail train, nearly giving their dimwitted brakeman Cracker (Charles Tyner) either a stroke, or heart attack from the stress of the near miss. A-No.-1 re-mounts the train, and hides inside a hollow metal pipe on a flatcar and as the morning advances and the fog burns off, he discovers that Cigaret is hiding in the adjacent pipe, and worse yet, may have alerted the #19's crew to their presence by leaving his hat out in the open on the flatcar's open decking. Shack stops the train on a high trestle so that he and Cracker can search for hobos more easily. Realizing that he will soon be discovered, Cigaret climbs down the trestle only to discover that A-No.-1 is already relaxing and smoking a cigar in a junk pile at the bottom of a ravine. They reboard the train beyond the trestle but A-No.-1 loses his grip (Shack has sabotaged some of the hand- and footholds) and falls off. Shack strikes Cigaret on the head with a large hammer, causing him to also fall off. The two men go back to the junk pile and haul several buckets up the slope where they smear the rails with grease. A passenger train is slowed down sufficiently by this such that A-No.-1 and Cigaret are able to jump onto the roof of one of the cars from an overhead sluice. The two jump off at the Salem yard and A-No.-1 uses Cigaret as a foil to steal a turkey. A policeman (Simon Oakland) chases them to a hobo jungle, but is surrounded and forced to humiliate himself by barking like a dog. A-No.-1, by now deeply annoyed by Cigaret's empty boasts, tells the younger man that if he will only listen and allow himself to learn, he has what it takes to become a true hobo, possibly even Emperor of the North Pole. A-No.-1 then gets involved in a local ongoing immersion baptism service as a means of having Cigaret steal a change of clothes for them both. Back in the Salem yard, A-No.-1 has once again tagged on the water tower his intent to ride The \\"#19 (train) all the way to Portland\\". Shack tells Hogger to take the train out of the yard at regular speed, thereby allowing the two hobos to board easily; Shack clearly wants to settle the matter once and for all. A-No.-1 and Cigaret climb aboard the undercarriage of one of the freight cars, where Shack (once again) drags a steel coupler pin on the end of a rope (bouncing off the passing track ties under the moving train) to injure them. In pain, A-No.-1 uses his foot to throw a lever that releases the pressure in the brake lines, causing the train to stop quickly. Coaly is thrown against the firebox, severely burning his back. Cracker is flung from his perch in the caboose, breaking his neck and dying in the process. Cigaret finds A-No.-1 nursing his injuries near a pond and berates him for lacking the strength and courage to go the distance. The younger man insists that he himself is going to become one of the all-time great hobos. After this tirade, Cigaret reboards the train, but immediately retreats in fear from the hammer-wielding and very angry Shack. Just as Shack is about to deliver a fatal blow, A-No.-1 appears and begins battling Shack. A desperate struggle involving heavy chains, planks of wood, and a fire axe ensues (Cigaret watches from a safe distance, atop the caboose). A-No.-1 ultimately has the bloodied Shack at his mercy, but instead of killing him, throws him off the train. In defiance, Shack yells that A-No.-1 has not seen the last of him. A-No.-1 then tosses Cigaret off for bragging about how \\"they\\" defeated Shack, telling the kid he could have become a good bum but he's got no class. \\"You had the juice, kid, but not the heart\\", he yells, as the train rolls away to Portland, beyond the distant horizon.

Borgnine's fee was $150,000. =Filming location= The film was shot in and around the city of Cottage Grove, Oregon (also the location used by Buster Keaton for his 1927 railroad feature The General), along the Oregon, Pacific and Eastern Railway (OP&E;)'s active right-of-way. Willis Kyle, president of the OP&E; in 1972, allowed the film company unlimited access to make the film, after an agreement with Oregon Governor Tom McCall and 20th Century Fox.TM-1972‚Äì12.pdf Oregon, Pacific and Eastern's rolling stock, including two steam locomotives (one being #19, a type 2-8-2 Baldwin Locomotive Works logging/mining Light Mikado, the other, #5, an ALCO 2-8-0 Consolidation), appear in the film. Also featured in the film is the Dorena Reservoir, located about 10 miles east of Cottage Grove, OP&E;'s railyard in downtown Cottage Grove, and the former Portland, Astoria, & Pacific Railroad's 1913-built timber trestle bridge over Mendenhall Creek near Buxton, Oregon, now part of the Banks‚ÄìVernonia State Trail. Filming finished on October 5, 1972.Alain Silver and James Ursini, Whatever Happened to Robert Aldrich?, Limelight, 1995 p 288 Reception =Critical= Roger Ebert gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4 and wrote, \\"The movie's energies are vast but never focused; what we‚Äôre finally left with is too much undirected violence and some superb direction in an uncertain cause.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times praised the film as \\"a fine, elaborately staged action melodrama\\", with \\"splendid performances\\" and \\"almost perfect action-movie characters, people who can't bore us with their earlier histories because they don't have any. They exist solely within the time and the action of the film itself. When it stops, they vanish, but we have had a sensational ride.\\" Variety found the storyline \\"limited in scope and insufficient to sustain a full-length feature ... While there is a wealth of violence under Robert Aldrich's forceful direction, the motivating idea is bogged down frequently with time out while Marvin expounds the philosophy and finer points of hobodom to a brash young kid (Keith Carradine) who wants terribly to be accepted.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4 and called it \\"a dismal adventure yarn\\" with \\"nothing in the script to make us care about either man.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times praised the film as \\"a robust, rollicking adventure yarn\\" with \\"one of the finest original screenplays to come out of Hollywood this year.\\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post knocked the \\"gratuitous, cartoon screenplay\\" and went on to state, \\"The whole point of the movie is the climax. Without that spectacular, sickening interlude of violence, the project would be completely negligible. The film's success depends on finding more people who are excited than repelled at the prospect of watching Lee Marvin hit Ernest Borgnine with an axe.\\" Quentin Tarantino later wrote \\"theoretically Aldrich should have been perfect for Emperor of the North. But instead of the muscular rusty claw hammer type direction you‚Äôd expect from the big man, Aldrich gives into corny thirties theatrics. The film seems more like a Damon Runyonesque musical about hobos than the crowbar vs. chain donnybrook that MGM sold it to audiences as.\\" Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 63% based on reviews from 8 critics. =Box Office= The film was a box office failure. Aldrich later said he'll \\"never understand\\" why this happened. > I thought the symbols were so clear. It never occurred to me that the > audience would miss the relationship ‚Äì that Borgnine was the Establishment, > that Marvin was the anti-Establishment individualistic character, and that > Keith Carradine was the opportunistic youth who would sell out for whatever > was most convenient. I never thought that people wouldn't root for the > Marvin character. I thought everyone would say, \\"I understand what Marvin > is. He's trying not to be regimented and suppressed, and denied his rights, > and I'm for him. \\" And nobody was. It just didn't happen. Nobody cared. Soundtrack On June 16, 2008, Intrada Records released the only commercial CD version of composer Frank De Vol's soundtrack to the public, 35 years after the film's release. The CD, limited to 1,200 copies, immediately sold out. Featuring several unused score cues, it was learned that Bill Medley of The Righteous Brothers had originally recorded the vocals for the film's score, but was replaced at the last minute for unknown reasons by Marty Robbins. The theme ballad, \\"A Man and a Train\\", written by Frank De Vol with lyrics by Hal David and sung by Marty Robbins, appears on his album All-Time Greatest Hits (Catalog# 77425), and the CD The Best of Marty Robbins released by Curb Records in January 2006, both featuring a second verse not used in the film. Home media The film was released in North America on DVD by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on June 5, 2006, under the title Emperor of the North. The Region 2 version was available under general release in the UK from September 3, 2007, under the same title.

Fumonisin B1 contamination of maize has been reported worldwide at mg/kg levels. Human exposure occurs at levels of micrograms to milligrams per day and is greatest in regions where maize products are the dietary staple. Fumonisin B1 is hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic in all animal species tested. The earliest histological change to appear in either the liver or kidney of fumonisin-treated animals is increased apoptosis followed by regenerative cell proliferation. While the acute toxicity of fumonisin is low, it is the known cause of two diseases which occur in domestic animals with rapid onset: equine leukoencephalomalacia and porcine pulmonary oedema syndrome. Both of these diseases involve disturbed sphingolipid metabolism and cardiovascular dysfunction. History rightFigure 1: Fusarium ear rot, caused by the fungi Fusarium verticillioides and F. proliferatum, may typically be a more common ear rot of corn. Source: UIUC available at: http://www.extension.umn.edu/cropenews/2007/07MNCN42.html In 1970, an outbreak of leukoencephalomalacia in horses in South Africa was associated with the contamination of corn with the fungus Fusarium verticillioides. It is one of the most prevalent seed-borne fungi associated with corn. Another study was done on the possible role of fungal toxins in the etiology of human esophageal cancer in a region in South Africa. The diet of the people living in this area was homegrown corn and F. verticillioides was the most prevalent fungus in the corn consumed by the people with high incidence of esophageal cancer. Further outbreaks of leukoencephalomalacia and people in certain regions with high incidence of esophageal cancer led to more research on F. verticillioides. Soon they found experimentally that F. verticillioides caused leukoencephalomalacia in horses and porcine pulmonary edema in pigs. It was found to be highly hepatotoxic and cardiotoxic in rats. In 1984 it was shown that the fungus was hepatocarcinogenic in rats. The chemical nature of the metabolites causing all this had still not been discovered in 1984. After discovery of the carcinogenicity of the fungus, isolation and chemical characterization of the mycotoxins and carcinogens produced by F. verticillioides was urgent. It wasn't until 1988 that the chemical nature of the carcinogen was unraveled. Fumonisin B1 and fumonisin B2 were isolated from cultures of F. verticillioides at the Programme on Mycotoxins and Experimental Carcinogenesis. The structures were elucidated in collaboration with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Several isomers of fumonisin B1 have been detected in solid rice culture. Now more than 100 different fumonisins are known, the most important ones being fumonisin B1, B2 and B3. Toxicokinetics Regarding toxicokinetics there are no human data available, but research on animals has been done. =Absorption= FB1 is taken orally via food. Overall, FB1 is poorly absorbed, less than 6%. Absorption of orally administered fumonisin B1 (10 mg/kg body weight) to rats is low (3.5% of dose) but rapid (Tmax = 1.02 h). FB1 does not significantly permeate through the human skin and hence has no significant systemic health risk after dermal exposure. =Distribution= After absorption, some appears to be retained in liver and kidneys. For rats that were fed diets containing fumonisins for several weeks, the concentrations of the fumonisins in the kidneys were approximately 10-fold higher than in the liver. Plasma distribution of the absorbed dose conformed to a two-compartment open model and the tissue (liver, kidney) concentration time results were consistent with a one-compartment open model. =Excretion= Elimination half-life in rats is 3.15 h for plasma, 4.07 h for liver, and 7.07 h for kidney. However, FB1 is rapidly excreted mostly in its original form. Small amounts are excreted in urine; the most are excreted in feces. Toxicodynamics Because of their similarity, fumonisins are able to inhibit sphingosine-sphinganin-transferases and ceramide synthases and are therefore competitive inhibitors of sphingolipid biosynthesis and metabolism. Figure 2: Sphingolipid metabolism showing the inhibition of ceramide synthase (x) by fumonisins and the changed concentrations of other compounds caused by this inhibition.Voss et al., 2007 Figure 2 shows the sphingolipid metabolism (schematic) and the inhibition caused by fumonisins. Fumonisin B1 inhibits the enzyme ceramide synthase (sphingosine N-acyltransferase), which acylates sphingoid bases. This blocks the formation of ceramide via two pathways. It inhibits de formation via de novo sphinganine and fatty acyl-CoA and via sphingosine produced by the breakdown of ceramide by ceramidase. The inhibition results in increased concentrations of sphinganine, sphingosine and their 1-phosphate metabolites and in decreased concentrations of complex sphingolipids. The accumulation of sphinganine and sphingosine is a primary cause of the toxicity of fumonisin B1 Sphinganine and sphingosine are cytotoxic, and have growth inhibitory effects. Also, these sphingoid bases induce apoptosis. Increased apoptosis seems to play an important role in the toxic effects including tumor induction. However, it should be mentioned that the reduced concentration of ceramide and the increased concentration of sphingosine-1-phosphate (as a result of FB1 intake) cause an inhibition of apoptosis and promote mitosis and regeneration. The balance between the intracellular concentration of compounds that inhibit apoptosis and those that induce apoptosis will determine the cellular response. Also, the decreased concentrations of complex sphingolipids appear to play a role in the abnormal behavior and altered morphology of the affected cells. Mechanism of action Figure 3: Proposed mechanism of action of ceramide synthase inhibition by FB1; FB1 mimics regions of the sphingoid base and the fatty acyl-CoA substrates. (Merrill et al., 2001) The proposed mechanism of action is depicted in figure 3. Fumonisin B1 occupies the space and electrostatic interactions of both sphinganine (or sphingosine) and fatty acyl-CoA in ceramide synthase. The part of FB1 that has structural similarity with sphingoid bases (the aminopentol part) may interact with the sphinganine binding site, whereas the negatively charged tricarbyllic acid groups may interact with the fatty acyl-CoA binding site. Because FB1 also occupies the fatty acyl-CoA space, it isn‚Äôt acylated, since acyl-CoA is necessary for the acylation; FB1 only inhibits ceramide synthase. However, when the tricarbillic acid groups are removed from FB1 by hydrolysis, the resulting product (aminopentol, AP1) doesn‚Äôt only act as an inhibitor, but also as a substrate for ceramide synthase; aminopentol is acylated by ceramide synthase to form N-palmitoyl-AP1. This supports the suggestion that the aminopentol part of FB1 occupies the space of sphinganine in the enzyme. N-palmitoyl-AP1 is an even more potent inhibitor of ceramide synthase and may therefore play a role in the toxicity of nixtamalized fumonisins. Toxic effects The risks of fumonisin B1 have been evaluated by The World Health Organization‚Äôs International Programme on Chemical Safety and the Scientific Committee on Food of the European Commission. They determined a tolerable daily intake for FB1, FB2, FB3, alone or in combination of 2 ¬µg/kg body weight. Until now, nothing about the kinetics and metabolism of fumonisin B1 in humans have been reported. On other animals much research has been done, but it might not be comparable to humans. In mice the elimination of FB1 is very rapid, but in humans it could be much slower considering their body weight. There are several possible pathways that cause toxic effects of Fumonisin B1. Most toxic effects are due to altered sphingolipid metabolism by inhibition of ceramide synthase. Production of reactive oxygen species could occur. This increases oxidative stress and induce lipid peroxidation and could damage cells. In agreement with this some studies showed decreased levels of glutathione in liver, but other studies showed even elevated levels of glutathione. Cytotoxic effects have also been reported. Another effect of exposure to FB1 is apoptosis. This has been observed in a number of different cells and tissues. Inhibition of ceramide synthase is not responsible for this effect. The main factors could be DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation. FB1 has also immunotoxic effects, but much more research is necessary to get a clear overview of the effects on the immune system. =Toxic effects in humans= Neural tube defects Neural tube defect are abnormalities of the brain and spinal cord in the embryo resulting from failure of the neural tube to close. Epidemiological studies and clinical trials have pointed out folate deficiency as a major risk factor for neural tube defects. FB1 disrupts sphingolipid metabolism and therefore this could affect folate uptake and cause neural tube defects. In 1990 and 1991 a sudden outbreak of neural tube defects occurred along the Texas-Mexico border. It is believed that this outbreak might have been due to high levels of FB1 that were observed in corn during previous years. Regions in China and South Africa with high corn consumption also have a high prevalence of neural tube defects. Esophageal cancer It is thought that there is a relationship between the occurrence of F. verticillioides and human esophageal cancer. A low socioeconomic status and a less varied diet, that mainly consists of corn and wheat, is associated with the appearance of esophageal cancer. This derives from epidemiologic studies in various countries. Other studies show that higher concentrations of FB1, FB2 and F. verticillioides are present in corn growing in regions with a high percentage of esophageal cancer. This in contrast with regions with low levels of F. verticillioides, FB1 and FB2 in corn. On top of this it seems that people with a high corn intake are at higher risk to develop esophageal cancer than people with low corn intake. This is observed by people in regions in Italy, Iran, Kenia, Zimbabwe, United States and Brazil with high incidence of esophageal cancer. Another study on the relationship between sphingolipid levels and cancer incidence didn‚Äôt show any significant relationship between serum sphingolipids and risk of esophageal cancer. This is quite remarkable, because elevated levels of sphingolipids sphinganine and sphingosine are believed to be biomarkers for exposure of FB1. Acute mycotoxicosis Acute mycotoxicosis is food poisoning by food products contaminated by fungi. In 1995 an outbreak of disease characterized by diarrhea and abdominal pain occurred in 27 villages in India. This was the result of consumption of moldy sorghum and corn due to rain damage. This outbreak was studied and the mycotoxicosis was connected to consumption of unleavened bread. Corn and sorghum samples were collected from the households and examined. The corn and sorghum were contaminated by Fusarium and Aspergillus and contained high levels of FB1 compared with samples of unaffected households. =Toxic effects in animals= Much research has been done on toxic effects of FB1 in animals. In vivo studies indicate that liver and kidneys are the main target organs. Fumonisins are poorly absorbed, rapidly eliminated and not metabolized in animals. In pigs and rats there is a wide distribution of FB1 and small amounts have been found to accumulate only in liver and kidneys. In vervet monkeys, some FB1 is partially hydrolyzed in the gut. Carcinogenic effects In rats and mice that were exposed to FB1 tumor formation occurred. Several studies on this subject have been done. Depending on the strain of mice being used different carcinomas were shown. FB1 is shown to be nongenotoxic. Therefore, the mechanisms responsible for cancer development should lie elsewhere. Important mechanisms for cancer development due to fumonisin B1 could be oxidative damage (production of reactive oxygen species) and lipid peroxidation. Hepatic and renal tumors could also be due to apoptosis by FB1. As a response to this there could be continuous regeneration of cells, causing cancer. It seems to be that disrupted sphingolipid metabolism is the causative factor for FB1-induced carcinogenicity, as is the case with the toxic effects. Based on all these animal studies FB1 is classified by The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B). Porcine pulmonary edema Porcine pulmonary edema due to FB1 is intensively studied after the first report in 1981 of swine with pulmonary edema after exposure to corn contaminated with F. verticillioides. Alteration in sphingolipid biosynthesis are reported, especially in lung, heart, kindey and liver tissue. Lethal pulmonary edema was developed within 4‚Äì7 days after exposure to feed with concentrations of FB1 >16 mg/kg body weight (>92 parts per million). Doses of 10 parts per million caused a milder form of pulmonary edema. Equine leukoencephalomalacia Leukoencephalomalacia is a neurotoxic disease of horses. Outbreaks of this disease in the 20th century resulted in a number of studies. Apparently FB1 was the cause for this disease. There were shown elevated levels of serum enzyme levels that indicate liver damage. They were normally observed by an elevation of the sphinganine/sphingosine ratio. FB1 possibly induces cardiovascular function, because of the elevated sphinganine/sphingosine ratio. This could be one of the main factors that causes leukoencephalomalacia. =Toxicity in laboratory animals= Effects of feeding rats with FB1 for up to 90 days were usually nephrotoxicity. Between different strains of rats, sensitivity to FB1 varied. In the kidneys the main effect was apoptosis. Also tubular atrophy and regeneration as well as decreased kidney weight was reported. Histopathologic effects on rat liver were reported after both short- and long-term exposure. The main cause was apoptosis. Mice don‚Äôt seem to be very sensitive to nephrotoxic effects in comparison with rats. In mouse kidneys little histological changes were seen by high dose exposure. The liver was also the main target organ in mice. Pathology is similar as in rats, with apoptosis and hepatocellular hyperplasia. Fumonisin B1 is possibly embryotoxic if the dose is maternally toxic. A number of studies on genotoxicity indicated no mutagenetic effects. Although fumonisin could damage DNA directly by production of reactive oxygen species. Mouse embryos were exposed to FB1 and they showed inhibited sphingolipid synthesis and growth. It caused neural tube defects. Folic acid uptake was dramatically inhibited. Treatment after exposure with folic acid reduced neural tube defects by 50‚Äì65%. Tolerable daily intake The risks of fumonisin B1 have been evaluated by The World Health Organization‚Äôs International Programme on Chemical Safety and the Scientific Committee on Food of the European Commission. They determined a tolerable daily intake for FB1, FB2, FB3, alone or in combination of 2 ¬µg/kg body weight. Detoxification The inhibition of ceramide synthase by FB1 is thought to be reversible, since the binding is formed by noncovalent interactions. Factors that will probably induce this reversibility are reduction of cellular FB1-concentration and increasing of cellular concentrations of the substrates for ceramide synthase. Also, the rate of removal of the accumulated sphinganine and sphingosine will affect the detoxification. The information on metabolism and biotransformation of FB1 is very sparse. However, metabolism most likely occurs in the gut since partially hydrolysed and fully hydrolysed FB1 were recovered in faeces but not in bile of vervet monkeys. Bioavailability of FB1 can be reduced by treating fumonisin-contaminated corn with glucomannans extracted from the cell wall of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These polysaccharides are able to bind certain mycotoxins and have a 67% binding capacity for fumonisins.

She killed herself and their four-year-old daughter Alexandra Tatiana Elise (nicknamed Shura) using a gas oven, similar to Hughes's first wife Sylvia Plath's suicide six years earlier. Early life and marriages Assia Gutmann was the daughter of a Jewish physician of Latvian origin, Lonya Gutmann, and a German Lutheran mother, Elisabeth \\"Lisa\\" (n√©e Gaedeke). Her sister Celia was born on 22 September 1929 and she escaped the Nazis at the beginning of World War II and emigrated to Israel. She spent most of her youth in Tel Aviv. Described by friends and family as a free- spirited young woman, she would go out to dance at the British soldiers' club, where she met Sergeant John Steele, with whom she moved to London in 1946 and who became her first husband in 1947. According to her biographers, Yehuda Koren and Eilat Negev, \\"she had entered an essentially loveless marriage with an Englishman at the age of 20 ‚Äì largely to enable her family to emigrate to England.\\" The couple later emigrated to Vancouver, Canada, where Assia enrolled at the University of British Columbia and met her second husband, Canadian economist Richard Lipsey. Assia and Steele divorced in 1949 and she married Lipsey in 1952. In 1956, on a ship to London, she met the 21-year-old poet David Wevill. They began an affair and Assia divorced Lipsey; she married Wevill in 1960. Career Assia was linguistically gifted. She had a successful career in advertising and was an aspiring poet who published, under her maiden name Assia Gutmann, an English translation of the work of Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai. Ted Hughes In 1961, poets Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath rented their flat in Chalcot Square, Primrose Hill, London, to Assia and David Wevill, and took up residence at North Tawton, Devon. Hughes was immediately struck with Assia, as she was with him. He later wrote: :We didn't find her - she found us. :She sniffed us out... :She sat there... :Slightly filthy with erotic mystery... :I saw the dreamer in her :Had fallen in love with me and she did not know it. :That moment the dreamer in me :Fell in love with her, and I knew it. Plath noted their chemistry. Soon afterward, Hughes and Assia began an affair. At the time of Plath's suicide, Assia was pregnant with Hughes's child, but she had an abortion soon after Plath's death. The actual relationship, who instigated it, and its circumstances, have been hotly debated for many years. After Plath's suicide, Hughes moved Assia into Court Green (the Devon home at North Tawton he had bought with Plath), where Assia helped care for Hughes's and Plath's two children, Frieda and Nicholas. Assia was reportedly haunted by Plath's memory; she even began using things that had once belonged to Plath. In their biography of Assia, Lover of Unreason, Koren and Negev maintain that she used Plath's items not from obsession, but for the sake of practicality since she was maintaining a household for Hughes and his children. On 3 March 1965, at age 37, Assia gave birth to Alexandra Tatiana Elise, nicknamed Shura, while still married to David Wevill. Ostracized by her lover's friends and family, and eclipsed by the figure of Plath in public life, Assia became anxious and suspicious of Hughes's infidelity, which was real enough. Hughes began affairs with Brenda Hedden, a married acquaintance who frequented their home, and Carol Orchard, a nurse 20 years his junior, whom he would later marry in 1970. Assia's relationship with Hughes was also fraught with other complexities, as shown by a collection of his letters to her acquired by Emory University. She was continually distraught by his reluctance to marry her and establish a home together, as well as his treatment of her as a \\"housekeeper\\". While he never publicly claimed Shura as his daughter, his sister Olwyn said that she believed the child was his. Death On 23 March 1969, Assia killed herself and four-year-old Shura in their London home at 3 Okeover Manor, Clapham Common. She had first sealed the kitchen door and window, then dissolved sleeping pills in a glass of water, chased with whisky, and then turned on the gas stove. She and Shura were found by the family's German au pair, Else Ludwig, lying together on a mattress in the kitchen. Legacy =In advertising= Assia composed the 90-second \\"Lost Island\\" advertisement for \\"Sea Witches\\" ladies' hair-dye product for both television and cinemas, called a \\"breakthrough in type\\" and a \\"huge success\\" by her biographers, Koren and Negev, that was \\"applauded in theaters.\\" The advert can be viewed in some classic ad compilations or sometimes as an online posting. =In literature= *Ted Hughes's volume of poetry Crow (1970) was dedicated to the memory of Assia and Shura. *His poem \\"Folktale\\" deals with his relationship with Assia: :She wanted the silent heraldry :Of the purple beach by the noble wall. :He wanted Cabala the ghetto demon :With its polythene bag full of ashes. *Hughes published half a dozen poems he had written for Assia, which were hidden among the total of 240 in New Selected Poems (1989). *In \\"The Error.\\" he wrote: :When her grave opened its ugly mouth :why didn't you just fly, :Why did you kneel down at the grave's edge :to be identified :accused and convicted? *In \\"The Descent\\", he wrote: :your own hands, stronger than your choked outcry, :Took your daughter from you.

They were timed to precede the G8 conference and summit held at the Gleneagles Hotel in Auchterarder, Scotland from 6‚Äì8 July 2005. Both events also coincided with the 20th anniversary of Live Aid. Run in support of the aims of the UK's Make Poverty History campaign and the Global Call to Action Against Poverty, ten simultaneous concerts were held on 2 July and one on 6 July. On 7 July, the G8 leaders pledged to double 2004 levels of aid to poor nations from US$25 billion to US$50 billion by the year 2010. Half of the money was to go to Africa. More than 1,000 musicians performed at the concerts, which were broadcast on 182 television networks and 2,000 radio networks. Live Aid organiser Bob Geldof announced the event on 31 May. Many former Live Aid acts offered their services to the cause. Prior to the official announcement of the event, many news sources referred to the event as Live Aid 2. However, Geldof and co-organiser Midge Ure have since explicitly said they do not think of the event as the same as Live Aid. On an episode of BBC Two music-based comedy panel show Never Mind the Buzzcocks, which aired on 2 March 2006, The Cribs frontman Ryan Jarman said he had texted Geldof to suggest that a \\"Live Aid 2\\" would be a good idea. However, after organising the event, Geldof said: \\"This is not Live Aid 2. These concerts are the start point for The Long Walk To Justice, the one way we can all make our voices heard in unison.\\" Many of the Live 8 backers were also involved in the largely forgotten NetAid concerts, including Executive Producer Jeff Pollack. Organisers of Live 8 presented the \\"Live 8 List\\" to the world leaders at the Live 8 call that politicians take action to \\"Make Poverty History\\".www.live8list.com Names from the list also appeared on the giant televisions at each concert during the broadcast. An official Live 8 DVD set was released on 7 November 2005 internationally and 8 November 2005 in the United States.  Concerts  Broadcaster Jonathan Ross opened the European Live 8 concerts with the words: \\"It's two o'clock in London on July the 2nd 2005. Hyde Park welcomes the world to Live 8.\\" There were ten concerts held on 2 July 2005, most of them simultaneously. The first to begin was held at the Makuhari Messe in Japan, with Rize being the first of all the Live 8 performers. During the opening of the Philadelphia concert outside the city's Museum of Art, actor Will Smith led the combined audiences of London, Philadelphia, Berlin, Rome, Paris and Barrie in a synchronised finger snap, meant to represent the death of a child every three seconds in Africa.The Associated Press (2 July 2005). \\"Rock, rap, reunions at Live 8 concerts\\".

Then-Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates made speeches at the London show, while former South African President Nelson Mandela addressed the crowd in the Johannesburg venue. Guest presenters, ranging from sports stars to comedians, also introduced acts. Included in the all-star line-up were Pink Floyd, reunited with former frontman Roger Waters for the first time in over 24 years. With the death of keyboardist Richard Wright in 2008, Live 8 was the final time the band's \\"classic\\" lineup performed together.

Tickets  A pair of Live 8 tickets Although the concerts were free, 66,500 pairs of tickets for the Hyde Park concert were allocated from 13 to 15 June 2005, to winners of a mobile phone text message competition that began on Monday, 6 June 2005. Entry involved sending the answer to a multiple choice question via a text message costing ¬£1.50. Winners were drawn at random from those who correctly answered the question. Over two million messages were sent during the competition, raising ¬£3 million. The first ¬£1.6 million raised was given to the Prince's Trust, which had to cancel its own annual Party in the Park concert in Hyde Park that year to make way for Live 8.MacMillan, Robert (15 June 2005). \\"Geldof: I Don't Like EBay\\". The Washington Post. According to the Live 8 website, funds raised beyond the ¬£1.6 million \\"will go to pay for the costs of Live 8, as it is a free event\\". Some ticket-winners placed their tickets for sale on internet auction site eBay, and were heavily criticised by the organisers of the event, including Bob Geldof. Initially, eBay defended its decision to allow the auctions to go ahead, stating that there were no laws against the resale of charity concert tickets. The site also offered to make a donation to Live 8 at least equivalent to the fees it would make from the ticket sales. Some people, angered by others seemingly using Live 8 to make money, placed fake bids for millions of pounds for such auctions in an attempt to force the sellers to take them off sale. It was later announced that eBay, under pressure from the British government, the public, as well as Geldof himself, would withdraw all auctions of the tickets.\\"eBay prevents Live 8 ticket sales\\". BBC News. 15 June 2005. Similar touting situations arose for the Edinburgh and Canadian shows, and eBay also halted the sales of the tickets.  Performances  = London, UK = Madonna during her presentation. * U2 and Paul McCartney opened the London concert, playing \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\". Later, Bono added a couple of lines of The Beatles' \\"Blackbird\\" to the end of \\"Beautiful Day\\". * Keane performed singles Somewhere Only We Know and Bedshaped. * The classic line-up of the progressive rock band Pink Floyd (Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason) played together on stage for the first time in 24 years. The band performed the songs \\"Speak to Me\\", \\"Breathe / Breathe (Reprise)\\", \\"Money\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb\\". They were the only band not to be verbally introduced. This was the final performance by the full classic line- up as Richard Wright died of cancer in 2008. * Pete Doherty joined Elton John for a version of T.Rex's hit \\"Children of the Revolution\\". * Using much of the musical equipment used by rock band Travis, who had just left the stage, Bob Geldof decided on the \\"spur of the moment\\" to perform The Boomtown Rats' hit \\"I Don't Like Mondays\\". * Before Madonna's set, Geldof introduced Birhan Woldu, who was the famous starving child in the CBC News report which prompted Geldof to organise Live Aid. She held hands with Madonna while the singer performed the first verses of \\"Like a Prayer\\". Geldof had asked Woldu whom she wanted to appear on stage with, with Woldu choosing Madonna as she was the only artist she'd heard of. * Chris Martin included the chorus of Status Quo's song \\"Rockin' All Over the World\\" in the bridge of Coldplay's song \\"In My Place\\". Status Quo had opened the 1985 Wembley Live Aid concert with that song. In addition, Coldplay were joined by Richard Ashcroft to perform \\"Bitter Sweet Symphony\\". * Robbie Williams began his set with a cover of Queen's \\"We Will Rock You\\". Williams stated in an interview that he \\"wanted to bring a bit of Freddie back from the original Live Aid\\". Williams had often performed the same section of \\"We Will Rock You\\" during his own concerts. = Philadelphia, USA = * Kaiser Chiefs opened the show with I Predict A Riot, Everyday I Love You Less And Less, and Oh My God. * Will Smith led the crowd in a sing-along to the theme song of \\"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\\". * Mayor John Street announced on stage that there were over 1 million spectators in the audience. * Closing act Stevie Wonder was joined on stage by Matchbox Twenty front man Rob Thomas and Maroon 5 lead singer Adam Levine.

During Wonder's performance, American Idol judge Paula Abdul and former Frasier actor David Hyde Pierce can be seen dancing off stage right. = Barrie, Canada = Deep Purple made an appearance and performed \\"Highway Star\\", \\"Smoke on the Water\\" and \\"Hush\\". DMC (of Run-DMC) performed with Elliot Easton of The Cars, and Joey Kraemer and Tom Hamilton of Aerosmith. The Tragically Hip played a set, just before Neil Young finished off Live 8 in Barrie with \\"4 Strong Winds\\", \\"Rockin' in the Free World\\" and \\"O Canada\\". = Berlin, Germany = Some of the highlights of the Berlin show included Brian Wilson who played a set with his band, doing \\"Our Prayer\\"/\\"Gee\\", \\"God Only Knows\\", \\"California Girls\\", \\"Good Vibrations\\", and \\"Fun Fun Fun\\", as well as Green Day, having released their political rock opera \\"American Idiot\\" the previous year. = Red Square in Moscow, Russia = Agata Khristy, By-2, Jango, Dolphin, Linda, Moral codex, Red Elvises, Splin, Pet Shop Boys  Separate rally and anti- poverty protest in Edinburgh  On 2 July, the same day as the Live 8 concerts, a rally and protest march was held in central Edinburgh, the nearest major city to the Gleneagles venue for the G8 conference later that week. This protest was organised by the Make Poverty History coalition as part of a series of events ahead of the G8 conference, and had already been planned before the announcement of Live 8. An estimated 225,000 people took part, making it the largest ever protest in Scotland\\"Thousands flock to poverty march\\". BBC News. 2 July 2005. and the largest ever anti-poverty protest in the UK.  Notable absences  In the weeks leading up to Live 8, British newspaper Daily Mirror began a petition, garnering support for British rock band Status Quo to play at the event. Originally offered a 6pm slot, the band already had commitments in Ireland and therefore requested an earlier slot. Their request was rejected by the organisers as there were no available slots.Colothan, Scott (17 June 2005). \\"STATUS QUO PLEAD YET AGAIN TO PERFORM AT LIVE 8\\". Gigwise.

Noel Gallagher later expressed disapproval that musicians were expected to rally at the convenience of Geldof.Melia, David (17 June 2005). \\"NOEL GALLAGHER DEFENDS OASIS' LIVE 8 NO SHOW\\". Gigwise. Gallagher was also vocally sceptical about the impact of Live 8, citing his belief that rock stars did not have as much influence over world leaders as the Live 8 organisers may believe.Smith, David (19 June 2005). \\"Gallagher casts doubt on the value of Live8\\". The Guardian (London). English rock band Radiohead also turned down an offer to play at the event.\\"Radiohead decline Live 8 request\\". BBC News. 7 June 2005.  Criticism  =Lack of African performers= The original lineup for the Hyde Park concert faced criticism for having only one ethnic minority artist - Mariah Carey. Blur and Gorillaz frontman Damon Albarn called the lack of black performers the organisers' \\"greatest oversight\\",Left, Sarah (10 June 2005). \\"Albarn hits out at 'Anglo Saxon' Live 8\\". The Guardian. while Senegalese musician Baaba Maal wrote in The Independent: \\"I do feel it's very patronising as an African artist that more of us aren't involved.\\" Live 8 organisers subsequently added British R&B; singer Ms. Dynamite, US rapper Snoop Dogg and Senegalese singer Youssou N'Dour to the Hyde Park lineup in response to the criticism. N'Dour was the only major African artist scheduled to perform at any of the five main concerts. A Live 8 spokesman said that a number of black performers had been approached but were not available to participateLive 8 logic attracts criticism. BBC News. 10 June 2005. and that the event would nonetheless feature a \\"large urban element\\".\\"Albarn criticises Live 8 concerts\\". BBC News. 10 June 2005. Organisers also argued that there were few black British artists who could attract a large global audience, stating that Geldof's intention was to aim for the biggest global stars to ensure media attention and a large television audience. A Live 8 concert in Johannesburg and an \\"Africa Calling\\" concert featuring an entirely African lineup at the Eden Project in Cornwall, were organised following the criticisms.\\"Live 8 concerts call for debt relief\\". Al Jazeera English. 2 July 2005. = Motives and controversy = Geldof's motives for organising Live 8 were questioned. TV and radio presenter Andy Kershaw directed criticisms at Geldof and the motives for Live 8, saying: \\"I am coming, reluctantly, to the conclusion that Live 8 is as much to do with Geldof showing off his ability to push around presidents and prime ministers as with pointing out the potential of Africa. Indeed, Geldof appears not to be interested in Africa's strengths, only in an Africa on its knees.\\"Andy Kershaw: The myth of Saint Bob, saviour of Africa. The Independent. 16 June 2005. Rashod Ollison of The Baltimore Sun echoed Kershaw's criticisms, calling the event a \\"ravenous orgy of celebrity ego trips\\".Ollison, Rashod D. (4 July 2005). \\"Did egos stifle Live 8 message?\\". The Baltimore Sun. Geldof's approach, of pressuring G8 leaders to improve aid, forgive debt and ease trade restrictions in Africa, was questioned by John O'Shea, chief executive of international aid charity Goal. O'Shea was concerned that \\"Live 8 overlooked the need to tackle Africa's corrupt regimes and establish a UN peacekeeping army in Darfur, the Congo and northern Uganda.\\" The organisers were criticised for using Africa to revive the careers of ageing rock stars more than about helping the poor in Africa. The lineup for the Canada Live 8 concert in particular, was criticised for being \\"out of touch\\" and filled with \\"musical has-beens\\". For the Edinburgh concert, Geldof called for children to \\"give up home and school for a week\\" to join supporters in a march (entitled The Long Walk to Justice) on 6 July, the start of the G8 summit, which drew the ire of teachers and local residents. Furthermore, the Live 8 concert's timing coincided with the long planned Make Poverty History march in Edinburgh. Damon Albarn suggested that the performers should put pressure on their record labels to pay \\"some kind of tariff\\" from the increased record sales that would come from playing at the event, so as to \\"genuinely show this is an altruistic act and that there is no self-gain in it\\". Pink Floyd's guitarist David Gilmour announced that he would donate the profits from the increased sales in Pink Floyd's Echoes album to charity, stating: \\"Though the main objective has been to raise consciousness and put pressure on the G8 leaders, I will not profit from the concert. This is money that should be used to save lives.\\"Byrne, Ciar (4 July 2005). \\"Pink Floyd album sales soar but no money for Gilmour\\". The Independent. Criticism was levelled at the Philadelphia Live 8 concert, when it was revealed that while the performers received no monetary compensation for their participation, they were given gift bags containing designer gifts worth about $12,000. The gifts included $2,000 Gibson guitars, $3,500 Hugo Boss suits and $6,000 Bertolucci watches. = Uncensored broadcasts = Despite the show being broadcast before the watershed in the United Kingdom, there was no attempt at censorship by the BBC. The network came under fire for its coverage of the Live 8 concerts due to the amount of live swearing by several performers that was broadcast before the watershed. Madonna, Snoop Dogg, Razorlight, Green Day, U2 and Velvet Revolver were also criticised for their use of foul language during their performances.Leonard, Tom (21 February 2006). \\"BBC censured over Live8 swearing\\". The Daily Telegraph (London). An investigation by the UK media regulator Ofcom ruled that television audiences were subjected to \\"the most offensive language\\" and demanded that the BBC issue an on-air apology.Singh, Anita (9 April 2008). \\"BBC forced to apologise on-air over foul language on Live Earth\\". The Daily Telegraph (London). In the United States, ABC drew criticism from the Parents Television Council when its delayed airing of the Hyde Park concert highlights failed to censor The Who's performance of \\"Who Are You\\" which contained the lyric, \\"Who the fuck are you?\\". ABC responded: \\"Unfortunately, one inappropriate phrase sung by one performer was initially missed and made it into the East Coast network feed. It was subsequently edited out of the West Coast feed.\\"Live 8 swearing angers US parents. BBC News.15 July 2005. = Other = MTV and VH1 were criticised for their coverage of the Live 8 concerts. Media critics and viewers complained that the networks focused too little on the actual musical performances, pointing to the frequent switching between artists and concerts, and cutting to commercials, interviews or \\"educational segments\\" while bands were still performing. The VJs also received criticism for frequently talking over the performances. The following weekend, MTV and VH1 re-aired ten commercial-free hours of music performances from the Live 8 concerts in response to the criticism.Ryan, Maureen (10 July 2005). \\"MTV defends Live 8 coverage\\". Chicago Tribune.Welsh, James (8 July 2005). \\"MTV, VH1 in US to re-air Live 8 concerts\\". Digital Spy. The London concert also received criticism when alcohol was outlawed for concertgoers, but made available for the VIPs.Baracaia, Alexa (29 June 2005). \\"Pop, but no alcohol in the park\\". London Evening Standard.  Legacy  On 2 July 2006, BBC One, CTV and MTV broadcast Live 8: What a Difference a Day Makes. In the UK, the special was 60 minutes as compared to the US version on MTV running at 90 minutes. The special was aired on MTV at 07:30 Eastern time, giving nearly no chance for viewers to be made aware of the broadcast. Instead of airing the special late at night, MTV aired their normal broadcasting schedule for Sundays, again adding to the criticism of MTV's lack of interest in Live 8. The Live 8 on AOL worldwide multi-feed webcast by America Online won the first Emmy Award for content delivered via the Internet, cellphones, and iPods (\\"Broadband award\\"). Live 8 on AOL was chosen as the winner out of 74 entrants. In a report issued in June 2006, the G8 have reportedly not lived up to their promises set in 2005. According to DATA, the US, U.K., Italy, and France increased their development-assistance pledges and actual aid to Africa in 2005, but Germany maintained its former level of contribution and Canada decreased aid in 2005. In general, the G8 is moving slowly in the effort to meet its promises. Some consider Live 8 to be a success, including Bob Geldof himself. However, others including the World Socialist Web Site dismissed Live 8 as a \\"public relations stunt\\" for G8 leaders and multinational corporations, due to the disparity between the rhetoric of the events and the actual efforts made after the events in reducing poverty. Geldof also believes that public attention was quickly diverted by the London bombings on 7 July 2005, the day after Live 8 Edinburgh which was the final concert in the series.

Mr. Long was born at Petit-Veyrier, Switzerland, near Geneva, on Oct. 11, 1915. Besides having studied in London and Harvard, he had a Doctor of Laws from the University of Paris and Doctor of Political Science from the University of Geneva and the Graduate Institute of International Studies. After military service in 1939-43, he joined the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and traveled across wartime Europe, negotiating prisoner-of-war exchanges and food relief assistance. After the war, he joined the Swiss federal government, and after service in Washington and London he began to work on trade issues as the director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr. Long helped keep the Western world moving toward freer trade in the 1970s despite protectionist pressures brought on by soaring oil prices, inflation and recession. As director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade from 1968 to 1980, Mr. Long helped to bring about the largest reductions in tariffs since World War II. GATT, an organization based in Geneva, was created in 1948 to oversee international trade. Mr. Long was the second director general of GATT, taking over from Eric Wyndham White, who had run the organization for the first 20 years of its existence. At first he was reluctant to take the job, since doing so meant giving up his post as Switzerland's ambassador to Britain and Malta, which he had accepted in 1967. Representatives of the leading industrial nations met at a 1973 summit meeting in Tokyo, setting off a six-year free-trade effort that became known as the Tokyo Round. These were difficult years for proponents of free trade. When oil prices quadrupled at the end of 1973‚Äîa consequence of actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries‚Äîthe twin shocks of recession and inflation rippled through the world economy. National currencies became exceptionally unstable. Industries everywhere pleaded with their governments for protection against foreign competitors. Yet Mr. Long managed to hold the world's democratic industrial governments, as well as some 20 developing countries, to the free trade commitments they had made at the start of negotiations. Not only did many tariffs drop, the Tokyo Round also represented the most comprehensive effort until then to eliminate or control other sorts of trade barriers, like quotas and export subsidies. In 1995, at the conclusion of another trade-liberalizing exercise known as the Uruguay Round, GATT's role in governing world commerce was assumed by the World Trade Organization, a new and more powerful institution. Because of his close personal ties with many leading French politicians Mr. Long became an intermediary between Charles de Gaulle's government in Paris and the Algerian National Liberation Front. He helped set up the talks that eventually led to the Evian agreements of 1962, which ended the Algerian war. Mr. Long returned to commercial diplomacy, playing a prominent role in negotiations that led to creation of the European Free Trade Association, a trading bloc set up in 1959 by seven European countries that did not wish to join the six-nation European Community, or Common Market. Mr. Long was also a Professor at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva. He was the author of several books and articles on economic affairs and political science. He is survived by his wife, the former Francine Roels, whom he married in 1946, and by two daughters and a son, Dr. Eric Long .

The tracks between Clementi station and Jurong East MRT station is the second longest between any two stations on the East West Line; the longest being the tracks between Expo MRT station and Changi Airport MRT station. It takes four minutes for trains to travel between Clementi and Jurong East stations. The station is also directly linked to the Clementi Mall and Clementi Bus Interchange. Together, they form the Clementi Integrated Transport Hub (ITH). History Faregates at the new exit A C151 train at Platform before HHPSD was implemented. Construction of the Clementi MRT station began on May 1985 after the awarding of the Contract 204 to LKN- Aoki venture and was completed on December 1987.LKN-Aoki venture clinches $48.7m MRT contract Clementi station opened on 12 March 1988, which is part of the Phase 1B of the MRT line. It travels from Outram Park to Clementi.Riding the MRT train to Clementi This station is painted light blue. On 5 August 1993, at around 7.53 am, two trains collided in the station. It appeared that one train had stopped at the station for longer than usual after experiencing a technical fault, and then a second westward train hit the first. 156 commuters were injured, many of whom were on their way to work. Eight were admitted to three hospitals, while the rest received outpatient treatment. A four-member independent panel was subsequently formed by SMRT to conduct an inquiry into the accident. The panel was chaired by Chua Koon Hoe, deputy director-general of the Public Works Department of Singapore, with the members Chang Meng Teng, deputy chairman of the Public Transport Council, and Dr. Natarajan Varaprasad, principal of Temasek Polytechnic. Low Tien Sio, SMRTC's general manager (project administration) served as the secretary. The results of the inquiry were announced by the SMRTC on 19 October 1993. Shortly after the accident The Straits Times had reported that an oil spill on the tracks was responsible for the second train's inability to brake in time. Some 50 litres of oil had spilled from a locomotive doing maintenance work on the track in the pre-dawn hours of 5 August. SMRT staff had been alerted to the spill and had dispatched a cleaning crew to the neighbouring Buona Vista, but approval to access the tracks was delayed. Already ten trains had reported difficulty braking on the track that morning. The 11th train had to use its emergency brakes upon reaching Clementi station, and while it was waiting for the brakes to be recharged so that it could move off again, the 12th approached the station and could not brake in time to avoid hitting the 11th train. The Communications Minister at that time, Mah Bow Tan, said that as the SMRT staff followed procedures and none were found to be negligent, so no staff would be punished. However SMRT promised to look into the problem of oil spillage from maintenance locomotives by replacing the hoses and oil seals on all locomotives, checking all locomotives for leaks upon their return to depots, and assigning a station master to inspect tracks for oil. Procedures were also amended so that trains would not move off from stations preceding the spill until it had been cleaned up. As with most of the stations along the East West Line, it was initially built without platform screen doors which prevents commuters from falling onto the train tracks. After several successful tests at Jurong East, Yishun and Pasir Ris, eventually, installation of the half-height screen doors started on 19 April 2010 and operations commenced on 16 August 2010. It was the 4th above-ground station to have Half-Height Platform Screen Doors installed and in operation with Bukit Gombak. Also, the station has been installed with high-volume low-speed fans, which commenced operations on 3 October 2012. Privacy screens were installed from Clementi MRT station to Clementi Avenue 2 and Clementi Avenue 1 to Clementi Road to minimise the impact of noise from residents. Installation works began in September 2016.Railway Noise Barriers on Track Together with Queenstown and Commonwealth stations, this station will see the construction of an additional overhead bridge linking the station to two new exits, which goes to the same side as the previous exit. Construction started in mid-2012 and opened on 25 August 2015. Possible interchange On 17 January 2013, a new railway line was announced. The Cross Island MRT line is a 50 km rail that stretches between Changi and Jurong. It was reported to pass towns such as Loyang, Pasir Ris, Hougang, Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Timah, West Coast and Clementi along the way. It will have interchange stations with all the current radial lines. Clementi is one of the stations to be an interchange with the Cross Island Line.

It is in the north-western part of the palace on the site of a former suttling-house (canteen) for the Guards; it overlooks Ambassadors' Court and Cleveland Row to the west of the old Chapel Royal. Prince Frederick occupied it for about a year, until his quarrel with the his father drove him from Court. In 1795, Princess Caroline resided here before her marriage with the Prince of Wales, afterwards George IV. Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, subsequently King of Hanover, lived here for a great many years; and the Duchess of Cambridge was identified with it from 1851 until her death in 1889. Later occupants included the future George V, the late Duke and Duchess of Gloucester from 1936 to 1970, and Princes Charles, William and Harry, who used it before moving to Clarence House. As Edward, Prince of Wales, the future Edward VIII lived at York House, before his refurbishment of Fort Belvedere in Windsor Great Park. The plan of the building is as follows: a suite of somewhat low-pitched rooms on the ground-floor, several drawing- rooms on the first floor, a corridor in the rear, and the servants' rooms on the top storey; all facing Cleveland Row. The ceilings of the top floor are low; height having been sacrificed to that of the drawing-room floor, during the nineteenth century a common practice in London mansions. The name York House has used at various times for other houses occupied by various Dukes of York, including those now known as Cumberland House, Dover House, Lancaster House and The Albany.

The song was written in 1966 and is on their 1967 debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, clocking in at almost ten minutes in length. The song originated when guitarist Syd Barrett heard the band's manager Peter Jenner humming a song, which Barrett tried to interpret by playing it on his guitar. Sharing the same emphasis on chromaticism with \\"Astronomy Domine\\", the piece was recorded in several takes during March and April of 1967. An earlier, longer recording of the song can be heard on the soundtrack to the film Tonite Lets All Make Love in London, which was recorded at Sound Technique Studios in early 1967 and was released in the same year. Other versions of the track appear on various bootleg recordings. The piece has been covered by acts such as T. Rex, Pearl Jam, Hawkwind, the Melvins, and Simon House. Composition and music \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" was one of the first psychedelic instrumental improvisations recorded by a rock band. It was seen as Pink Floyd's first foray into space rock (along with \\"Astronomy Domine\\"), although band members would later disparage this term. It has also been described as an experimental rock and psychedelic rock song as well as an example of proto-prog. \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" originated when early Pink Floyd manager Peter Jenner was trying to hum a song he could not remember the name of (most commonly identified as Love's cover of \\"My Little Red Book\\").Manning 2006, p. 26Chapman 2010, pp. 125‚Äì6 Guitarist and vocalist Syd Barrett followed Jenner's humming with his guitar and used it as the basis for the principal melody of \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\". Bassist Roger Waters once told Barrett that the song's riff reminded him of the theme tune from Steptoe and Son (by Ron Grainer). Around the time the song was written, Barrett was also inspired by AMM and their guitarist Keith Rowe, who had a pattern of moving pieces of metal along his guitar's fretboard. The free-form section (and also, \\"Pow R. Toc H.\\") was inspired by Frank Zappa's free-form freak-out and The Byrds' \\"Eight Miles High\\". \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" shares an emphasis on chromaticism with \\"Astronomy Domine\\". The main theme descends chromatically from B to G, before resolving to E, all chords major. The opening hook of the piece is a distorted, descending guitar riff, played by Barrett, its composer, with Waters on bass and Richard Wright on organ. Nick Mason's drums then kick in, and after the riff repeats itself a bit, the track turns into improvisation, including modal improvisations, flourishes on the Farfisa organ, and quiet interludes.Palacios 2010, p. 189 The song gradually becomes almost structureless and in free-form tempo, punctuated only by strange guitar noises. Eventually, however, the entire band restates the main theme, which is repeated with decreasing tempo and more deliberate intensity. Waters once called the song \\"an abstract piece\\".Palacios 2010, p. 129 A bass riff in the song later evolved into another Pink Floyd song, \\"Let There Be More Light\\", which was written by Waters.Palacios 2010, p. 200Palacios 2010, p. 319 Recording The stereo version of the song has an organ moving from speaker to speaker; the effect is lost on the mono version of the song, where it simply gains an extra organ and guitar sound. However, the organ is very prominent during the first 50 seconds of the mono version‚Äîalong with some special effects‚Äîbut inaudible in the stereo mix until the improvised section. Five takes of the song were originally recorded on 27 February 1967,Palacios 2010, p. 187 with a sixth later recorded on 16 March 1967, in an attempt to create a shorter version,Palacios 2010, p. 195 with overdubs in June of that year. The Piper version also appears on the official compilation albums Relics and A Nice Pair. Despite Smith trying to bring the rest of the album's tracks from a jam-long length to something more manageable,Manning 2006, p. 34 Smith relented for \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\", as Jenner recalled: \\"It was definitely the deal that‚Äîhey, here you can do 'Interstellar Overdrive', you can do what you like, you can do your weird shit. So 'Interstellar Overdrive' was the weird shit . . . and again, hats off to Norman for letting them do that.\\" A delay effect was created by producer Norman Smith by superimposing a second version of the song over a previous version. Smith played the drum roll on the song near the very end.Chapman 2010, p. 170 Alternative versions and live performances The studio recording on The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is the one that most listeners are familiar with, yet several other versions survive from both the recording studio and the stage. It was first recorded as a demo on 31 October 1966,Manning 2006, p. 28 recorded live-in-studio at Thompson Private Recording Company.Palacios 2010, p. 136 This version was used as the audio sound to the film San Francisco, which was made by a friend of Barrett's, Anthony Stern.Palacios 2010, pp. 136‚Äì137 While filmmaker Peter Whitehead and his secondhand Stern were having a discussion, the topic about Pink Floyd was brought about by Stern, to which Whitehead told him, \\"yeah, terrible music\\".Palacios 2010, p. 156 Stern said that \\"they're successful now\\", and suggest the pair go watch Pink Floyd, at their gig at the Royal College of Art. Whitehead recalled that they \\"went to UFO and I liked them. Not connected to pop music, a long improvisatory quality, ideal for what I wanted.\\" Whitehead convinced Pink Floyd to record \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" for a film he was working on.Palacios 2010, p. 157 Before turning up at the recording studio, the band held a rehearsal, and the next day, 11 January 1967,Manning 2006, p. 31Chapman 2010, p. 123 went to Sound Techniques studios. The studio, which was originally a dairy factory, was run by engineers Geoff Frost and John Wood. For the session, which was booked for two hours, Wood and Joe Boyd operated the mixing desk, while Whitehead and Stern were filming. This recording of the song lasted nearly 16-minutes in length, recorded onto a 4-track recorder in one take, as the band didn't want to have to play through the song again. The band then played another original instrumental, titled \\"Nick's Boogie\\". While 5 seconds of the band playing was included in Whitehead's Tonite Lets All Make Love in London film, edits of the recording was included on the film's respective soundtrack. The soundtrack (released in 1968) includes an edited version of the song and two reprises of it. The full version is available on the album London '66‚Äì'67. While attempting to get the band a record deal, Boyd returned with the group to Sound Techniques studios.Manning 2006, p. 29Manning 2006, p. 32 There, Boyd and the band recorded a demo tape which was to be given to various record labels, one of the songs that features on the tape was \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\". An early, unoverdubbed, shortened mix of the album's \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" was used for a French EP released in July 1967. The 40th anniversary edition of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn contains two different, five-minute-long versions of the song, one of them being take 6 from 16 March. Despite its encapsulation of their concert repertoire under the leadership of guitarist and composer Barrett, the long, improvisational, freeform structure of the piece is not particularly representative of the group's recorded output. As drummer Mason states in his book Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd, live versions of the song featured many sections that did not appear on the album, and would often last more than 20 minutes. During the band's days playing in residence at London underground clubs such as the UFO (Underground Freak Out), the song usually opened their show. It occupied other positions, including the encore, until it was retired from the band's setlist in 1970. The song had first appeared in live performances in the autumn of 1966. During one performance of the song, at a gig organized by Hoppy Hopkins, Pink Floyd managed to blow out the power of a venue. Hopkins called it \\"Very cold, very dirty but very nice.\\" After recording session for Piper were over, Pink Floyd played a 30-minute version of \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\".Palacios 2010, p. 232 Pink Floyd were filmed performing the song for Granada Television's Scene Special documentary, in January 1967 at the UFO Club. A late-Barrett era rendition was recorded live in Rotterdam in November 1967, at the Hippy-Happy Fair.Palacios 2010, p. 299 The song was later replaced by \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" as the main part of the band's set lists, after Barrett left the band.Palacios 2010, p. 275Palacios 2010, p. 301 A version of \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" was cut from the Ummagumma live album. The song was played by Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets in 2018. In 1969, Frank Zappa joined the band onstage at the Actuel Festival in Amougies, Belgium, to perform a long loose version of the song. Although Zappa himself later had no recollection of the performance, Floyd drummer Mason praised him saying Zappa is really one of those rare musicians that can play with us. The little he did in Amougies was terribly correct. The song has been released in many different lengths across different releases, original 1967 Piper at the Gates of Dawn releases have the track at , whilst the edited 1968 Tonite Let's All Make Love in London version clocks in at . This same recording was released in its entirety twice, first on the 1990 reissue of the album, and then again in 1995 on the EP London '66-'67 clocking in at . The earliest studio recording of the song to be released was the 1966 recording with a running time of and was released in 2017 on the Interstellar Overdrive single. Three live performances of the song featured on The Early Years 1965‚Äì1972 boxset, with timings being (recorded in 1969), (recorded in 1967) and (recorded in 1968).

Often economic collapse is accompanied by social chaos, civil unrest and a breakdown of law and order. Cases There are few well documented cases of economic collapse. One of the best documented cases of collapse or near collapse is the Great Depression, the causes of which are still being debated. > \\"To understand the Great Depression is the Holy Grail of macroeconomics.\\" > ‚ÄîBen Bernanke (1995) Bernanke's comment addresses the difficulty of identifying specific causes when many factors may each have contributed to various extents. Past economic collapses have had political as well as financial causes. Persistent trade deficits, wars, revolutions, famines, depletion of important resources, and government-induced hyperinflation have been listed as causes. In some cases blockades and embargoes caused severe hardships that could be considered economic collapse. In the U.S. the Embargo Act of 1807 forbade foreign trade with warring European nations, causing a severe depression in the heavily international trade-dependent economy, especially in the shipping industry and port cities, ending a great boom. The Union blockade of the Confederate States of America severely damaged the South's plantation owners; however, the South had little economic development. The blockade of Germany during World War I led to starvation of hundreds of thousands of Germans but did not cause economic collapse, at least until the political turmoil and the hyperinflation that followed. For both the Confederacy and Weimar Germany, the cost of the war was worse than the blockade. Many Southern plantation owners had their bank accounts confiscated and also all had to free their slaves without compensation. The Germans had to make war reparations. Following defeat in war, the conquering country or faction may not accept paper currency of the vanquished, and the paper becomes worthless. (This was the situation of the Confederacy.) Government debt obligations, primarily bonds, are often restructured and sometimes become worthless. Therefore, there is a tendency for the public to hold gold and silver during times of war or crisis. Effects of war and hyperinflation on wealth and commerce Hyperinflation, wars, and revolutions cause hoarding of essentials and a disruption of markets. In some past hyperinflations, workers were paid daily and immediately spent their earnings on essential goods, which they often used for barter. Store shelves were frequently empty. More stable foreign currencies, silver and gold (usually coins) were held and exchanged in place of local currency. The minting country of precious metal coins tended to be relatively unimportant. Jewelry was also used as a medium of exchange. Alcoholic beverages were also used for barter. Desperate individuals sold valuable possessions to buy essentials or traded them for gold and silver. In the German hyperinflation, stocks held much more of their value than paper currency. Bonds denominated in the inflating currency may lose most or all value. Bank holidays, conversion or confiscation of accounts and new currency A 1000 Mark banknote, over-stamped in red with \\"Eine Milliarde Mark\\" long scale (1,000,000,000 mark), issued in Germany during the hyperinflation of 1923 During severe financial crises, sometimes governments close banks. Depositors may be unable to withdraw their money for long periods, as was true in the United States in 1933 under the Emergency Banking Act. Withdrawals may be limited. Bank deposits may be involuntarily converted to government bonds or to a new currency of lesser value in foreign exchange. During financial crises and even less severe situations, capital controls are often imposed to restrict or prohibit transferring or personally taking money, securities or other valuables out of a country. To end hyperinflations a new currency is typically issued. The old currency is often not worth exchanging for new. Historical examples =China 1852‚Äì70= The Taiping Rebellion followed by internal warfare, famines and epidemics caused the deaths of over 100 million and greatly reduced the economy.See, e.g. Korotayev, Andrey V., & Tsirel, Sergey V. A Spectral Analysis of World GDP Dynamics: Kondratieff Waves, Kuznets Swings, Juglar and Kitchin Cycles in Global Economic Development, and the 2008‚Äì2009 Economic Crisis. Structure and Dynamics. 2010. Vol.4. #1. P.3-57.p 27. This is a secondary source. Primary sources are cited in article. =Weimar Germany= Following Germany's defeat in World War I, political instability resulted in murders and assassinations of hundreds of political figures. (See: German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919 and Kapp Putsch) Germany's finances were heavily strained by the war and reparations in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles, leaving the government unable to raise enough taxation to operate and make war reparations. The government resorted to printing money to cover the shortfall, which resulted in major hyperinflation; one book on these events, which includes quotes and a few first hand accounts, is When Money Dies. The hyperinflation ended in December 1923, with government debt being cleared at the cost of ordinary citizens' savings. Some believe that the hyperinflation of 1923 helped fuel the eventual rise of the Nazi party, and the rise of Hitler to power in 1933. Economists, however, tend to attribute Hitler's rise to the Deflation and the Great Depression beginning in 1929.Der Spiegel, Wolfgang M√ºnchau, Das Drei√üiger- Jahre-Programm der FDP Paul Krugman concluded that the 1923 hyperinflation didn‚Äôt bring Hitler to power, but the Br√ºning deflation and depression. Before 1929, the Nazi party had been actually in decline, receiving less than 3% of votes in the German federal election in 1928 (see election results of the Nazi Party). =The Great Depression of the 1930s= While arguably not a true economic collapse, the decade of the 1930s witnessed the most severe worldwide economic contraction since the start of the Industrial Revolution. In the US, the Depression began in the summer of 1929, soon followed by the stock market crash of October 1929. American stock prices continued to decline in fits and starts until they hit bottom in July 1932. In the first quarter of 1933, the banking system broke down: asset prices had collapsed, bank lending had largely ceased, a quarter of the American work force was unemployed, and real GDP per capita in 1933 was 29% below its 1929 value.Real GDP per capita was $7099 in 1929 and $5056 in 1933; NIPA Table 7.1, row 9. The ensuing rapid recovery was interrupted by a major recession in 1937‚Äì38. The USA fully recovered by 1941, the eve of its entry in World War II, which gave rise to a boom as dramatic as the Depression that preceded it. While there were numerous bank failures during the Great Depression, most banks in developed countries survived, as did most currencies and governments. The most significant monetary change during the depression was the demise of the gold standard by most nations that were on it. In the U.S., the dollar was redeemable in gold until 1933 when U.S. citizens were forced to turn over their gold (except for 5 ounces) for fiat currency (See: Executive Order 6102) and were forbidden to own monetary gold for the next four decades. Subsequently, gold was revalued from $20.67 per ounce to $35 per ounce. U.S. dollars remained redeemable in gold by foreigners until 1971. Gold ownership was legalized in the U.S. in 1974, but not with legal tender status. As bad as the Great Depression was, it took place during a period of high productivity growth, which caused real wages to rise. The high unemployment was partly a result of the productivity gains, allowing the number of hours of the standard work week to be cut while restoring economic output to previous levels after a few years. Workers who remained employed saw their real hourly earnings rise because wages remained constant while prices fell; however, overall earnings remained relatively constant because of the reduced work week. Converting the dollar to a fiat currency and devaluing against gold ensured the end of deflation and created inflation, which made the high debt accumulated during the 1920s boom easier to repay, although some of the debt was written off. =Economic collapse of Soviet communism= During the 1980s, the Eastern Bloc, which relied on a stagnant form of planned economy, experienced a decade-long period of stagflation, and eventual collapse from which it did not recover, culminating with revolutions and the fall of communist regimes throughout Central and Eastern Europe and eventually in the Soviet Union. The process was accompanied by a gradual but important easing of restrictions on economic and political behaviour in the late 1980s, including the satellite states. The collapse in the USSR was characterized by an increase in the death rate, especially by men over 50, with alcoholism a major cause. There was also an increase in violent crime and murder. The Russian population peaked in the 1990s and is lower today than two decades ago, as the demographics of Russia show. A firsthand account of conditions during the economic collapse was told by Dmitry Orlov, a former USSR citizen who became a US citizen but returned to Russia for a time during the crisis. =Russian financial crisis of 1998= After more or less stabilizing after the disintegration of the USSR, a severe financial crisis took place in the Russian Federation in August 1998. It was caused by low oil prices and government expenditure cuts after the end of the Cold War. Other nations of the former Soviet Union also experienced economic collapse, although a number of crises also involved armed conflicts, like in the break- away region Chechnya. The default by Russia on its government bonds in 1998 led to the collapse of highly leveraged hedge fund Long Term Capital Management, which threatened the world financial system. The U.S. Federal Reserve organized a bailout of LTCM which turned it over to a banking consortium. =Argentine economic crisis (1999‚Äì2002)= The depression, which began after the Russian and Brazilian financial crises, caused widespread unemployment, riots, the fall of the government, a default on the country's foreign debt, the rise of alternative currencies and the end of the peso's fixed exchange rate to the US dollar. The economy shrank by 28 percent from 1998 to 2002. In terms of income, over 50 percent of Argentines were poor and 25 percent, indigent; seven out of ten Argentine children were poor at the depth of the crisis in 2002. By the end of November 2001, people began withdrawing large sums of dollars from their bank accounts, turning pesos into dollars, and sending them abroad, which caused a bank run. The freeze enraged many Argentines who took to the streets of important cities, especially Buenos Aires. They engaged in protests. The president De la R√∫a eventually fled the Casa Rosada in a helicopter on 21 December 2001. =Present economic trends= In Latvia, GDP declined more than 20% from 2008 to 2010, one of the worst recessions on record. In Greece, GDP declined more than 26% starting in 2008. =Venezuela (2013‚Äìpresent)= Since 2013, Venezuela has been suffering an economic crisis. It's the worst in Venezuelan history, caused by the economic policies of the president, Nicol√°s Maduro the successor of Hugo Ch√°vez, the fall in oil prices and internal and external factors. Since 2014, Venezuela's GDP has been in recession, falling more 40%. The economy has collapsed, causing shortages of basics goods, economic downturn and hyperinflation since 2017. Also, there are drastic increases in the crime, corruption, poverty and hunger. Thousands of Venezuelans have fled to neighboring countries. Doom loop In economics, a doom loop is \\"a negative spiral that can result when banks hold sovereign bonds and governments bail out banks\\".Doom Loops and Europe‚Äôs Financial System, IGM Forum, May 22, 2019. Accessed August 24, 2019. It can lead to economic collapse. Alternative theories =Austrian school= Some economists (i.e. the Austrian School, in particular Ludwig von Mises), believe that government intervention and over-regulation of the economy can lead to the conditions for collapse. In particular, Austrian theoretical research has been focused on such problems emanating from socialist forms of economic organization. This however is not a theory of economic collapse involving the breakdown of freely functioning financial markets; rather, the focus is on economic malfunction and crisis emanating from state control. However, many Austrian economists also subscribe to what is called the \\"ABCT\\", or Austrian Business Cycle Theory. Economist Roger Garrison describes the bubble as merely a form of unsustainable boom (not a theory of all depression), as Mises and F.A. Hayek did, despite their disagreements on the exact workings of it. The essential part of the theory is that it is inherently unsustainable to try to manipulate monetary policy to boost both investment and consumption; usually through interest rate manipulation and bond-buying and such. The \\"boom\\" was created by \\"malinvestments,\\" as Mises called them; business decisions that are bad investments and unsustainable in the long run because lowering interest rates by padding the supply of money and credit will only work in the short-term, but will ultimately collapse because the government can only hold down interest rates so long before fear of inflation kicks in (and deflation comes at the peak of the business cycle), or they go into hyperinflation (which is completely outside the realm of the ABCT). =Georgescu-Roegen's theory of Earth's ever decreasing carrying capacity= Romanian American economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, a progenitor in economics and the paradigm founder of ecological economics, has argued that the carrying capacity of Earth‚Äîthat is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels ‚Äî is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use; and consequently, that the world economy as a whole is heading towards an inevitable future collapse, leading to the demise of human civilisation itself. Georgescu-Roegen is basing his pessimistic prediction on the two following considerations: * According to his ecological view of 'entropy pessimism', matter and energy is neither created nor destroyed in man's economy, only transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable natural resources) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless waste and pollution). In effect, all of man's technologies and activities are only speeding up the general march against a future planetary 'heat death' of degraded energy, exhausted natural resources and a deteriorated environment‚Äîa state of maximum entropy on Earth. * According to his social theory of 'bioeconomics', man's economic struggle to work and earn a livelihood is largely a continuation and extension of the biological struggle to sustain life and survive. This struggle manifests itself as a permanent social conflict that can be eliminated neither by man's decision to do so nor by the social evolution of mankind. Consequently, we are biologically unable to restrain ourselves collectively on a permanent and voluntary basis for the benefit of unknown future generations; the pressure of population on Earth's resources will only increase. Taken together, the Industrial Revolution in Britain in the second half of the 18th century has unintentionally thrust man's economy into a long, never-to-return overshoot- and-collapse trajectory with regard to the Earth's mineral stock. The world economy will continue growing until its inevitable and final collapse in the future. From that point on, ever deepening scarcities will aggravate social conflict throughout the globe and ultimately spell the end of mankind itself, Georgescu-Roegen conjectures. Georgescu-Roegen was the paradigm founder of ecological economics and is also considered the main intellectual figure influencing the degrowth movement. Consequently, much work in these fields is devoted to discussing the existential impossibility of allocating Earth's finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations. This number of generations is likely to remain unknown to us, as there is no way ‚Äî or only little way ‚Äî of knowing in advance if or when mankind will ultimately face extinction. In effect, any conceivable intertemporal allocation of the finite stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point.

It is a direct attack on Thomas Shadwell, another prominent poet of the time. It opens with the lines: Bust of Mac Flecknoe from an 18th century edition of Dryden's poems Written about 1678, but not published until 1682 (see 1682 in poetry), \\"Mac Flecknoe\\" is the outcome of a series of disagreements between Thomas Shadwell and Dryden. Their quarrel blossomed from the following disagreements: \\"1) their different estimates of the genius of Ben Jonson, 2) the preference of Dryden for comedy of wit and repartee and of Shadwell, the chief disciple of Jonson, for humors comedy, 3) a sharp disagreement over the true purpose of comedy, 4) contention over the value of rhymed plays, and 5) plagiarism.\\" Oden, Richard, L. Dryden and Shadwell, The Literary Controversy and 'Mac Flecknoe' (1668‚Äì1679) Shadwell fancied himself heir to Ben Jonson and to the variety of comedy which the latter had commonly written. Shadwell‚Äôs poetry was certainly not of the same standard as Jonson‚Äôs, and it is possible that Dryden wearied of Shadwell‚Äôs argument that Dryden undervalued Jonson. Shadwell and Dryden were separated not only by literary grounds but also by political ones as Shadwell was a Whig, while Dryden was an outspoken supporter of the Stuart monarchy. The poem illustrates Shadwell as the heir to a kingdom of poetic dullness, represented by his association with Richard Flecknoe, an earlier poet already satirized by Andrew Marvell and disliked by Dryden, although the poet does not use belittling techniques to satirize him. Multiple allusions in the satire to 17th-century literary works, and to classic Greek and Roman literature, demonstrate Dryden‚Äôs complex approach and his mastery over the mock-heroic style. The poem begins in the tone of an epic masterpiece, presenting Shadwell's defining characteristic as dullness, just as every epic hero has a defining characteristic: Odysseus's is cunning; Achilles's is wrath; the hero of Spenser's The Faerie Queene is of holiness; whilst Satan in Paradise Lost has the defining characteristic of pride. Thus, Dryden subverts the theme of the defining characteristic by giving Shadwell a negative characteristic as his only virtue. Dryden uses the mock-heroic through his use of the heightened language of the epic to treat the trivial subjects such as poorly written and largely dismissible poetry. The juxtaposition of the lofty style with unexpected nouns such as 'dullness' provides an ironic contrast and makes the satiric point by the obvious disparity. In this, it works at the verbal level, with the language being carried by compelling rhythm and rhyme.  Notes  References *Oden, Richard, L.

The most common type of CDH is a Bochdalek hernia; other types include Morgagni hernia, diaphragm eventration and central tendon defects of the diaphragm. Malformation of the diaphragm allows the abdominal organs to push into the chest cavity, hindering proper lung formation. CDH is a life-threatening pathology in infants and a major cause of death due to two complications: pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension. Experts disagree on the relative importance of these two conditions, with some focusing on hypoplasia, others on hypertension. Newborns with CDH often have severe respiratory distress which can be life-threatening unless treated appropriately. Classification =Bochdalek hernia= The Bochdalek hernia, also known as a postero-lateral diaphragmatic hernia, is the most common manifestation of CDH, accounting for more than 95% of cases. In this instance the diaphragm abnormality is characterized by a hole in the postero-lateral corner of the diaphragm which allows passage of the abdominal viscera into the chest cavity. The majority of Bochdalek hernias (80‚Äì85%) occur on the left side of the diaphragm, a large proportion of the remaining cases occur on the right side. To date, it carries a high mortality and is an active area of clinical research. =Morgagni hernia= CT of the chest demonstrates a Morgagni hernia (red arrow) This rare anterior defect of the diaphragm is variably referred to as a Morgagni, retrosternal, or parasternal hernia. Accounting for approximately 2% of all CDH cases, it is characterized by herniation through the foramina of Morgagni which are located immediately adjacent and posterior to the xiphoid process of the sternum. =Diaphragm eventration= The diagnosis of congenital diaphragmatic eventration is used when there is abnormal displacement (i.e. elevation) of part or all of an otherwise intact diaphragm into the chest cavity. This rare type of CDH occurs because in the region of eventration the diaphragm is thinner, allowing the abdominal viscera to protrude upwards. Pathophysiology It involves three major defects: * A failure of the diaphragm to completely close during development * Herniation of the abdominal contents into the chest * Pulmonary hypoplasia Diagnosis Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: coronal obstetric ultrasound (head to right of image, thorax centre, abdomen left) shows the stomach and heart both within the thorax. This condition can often be diagnosed before birth and fetal intervention can sometimes help, depending on the severity of the condition. ‚Äì report of new operation, pioneered at London's King's College Hospital which reduced death rates in the most at risk by 50% Infants born with diaphragmatic hernia experience respiratory failure due to both pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypoplasia. The first condition is a restriction of blood flow through the lungs thought to be caused by defects in the lung. Pulmonary hypoplasia or decreased lung volume is directly related to the abdominal organs presence in the chest cavity which causes the lungs to be severely undersized, especially on the side of the hernia. Survival rates for infants with this condition vary, but have generally been increasing through advances in neonatal medicine. Work has been done to correlate survival rates to ultrasound measurements of the lung volume as compared to the baby's head circumference. This figure known as the lung to head ratio (LHR). Still, LHR remains an inconsistent measure of survival. Outcomes of CDH are largely dependent on the severity of the defect and the appropriate timing of treatment. A small percentage of cases go unrecognized into adulthood. Treatment The first step in management is orogastric tube placement and securing the airway (intubation). Ideally the baby will never take a breath, to avoid air going into the intestines and compressing the lungs and heart. The baby will then be immediately placed on a ventilator. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used as part of the treatment strategy at some hospitals. ECMO acts as a heart-lung bypass. Diaphragm eventration is typically repaired thoracoscopically, by a technique called plication of the diaphragm. Plication basically involves a folding of the eventrated diaphragm which is then sutured in order to ‚Äútake up the slack‚Äù of the excess diaphragm tissue. Prognosis Congenital diaphragmatic hernia has a mortality rate of 40‚Äì62%, with outcomes being more favorable in the absence of other congenital abnormalities. Individual rates vary greatly dependent upon multiple factors: size of hernia, organs involved, additional birth defects, and/or genetic problems, amount of lung growth, age and size at birth, type of treatments, timing of treatments, complications (such as infections) and lack of lung function.

For her great beauty she was known as La Belle Stuart and served as the model for an idealised, female Britannia. She is one of the Windsor Beauties painted by Sir Peter Lely. Biography Frances was the daughter of Walter Stewart, or Stuart, a physician in Queen Henrietta Maria's court, and a distant relative of the royal family, and his wife, Sophia (n√©e Carew). She was born on 8 July 1647 in exile in Paris, but was sent to England in 1663 after the restoration by Charles I's widow, Henrietta Maria, as maid of honour (a court appointment) and subsequently as lady-in-waiting to Charles II's new bride, Catherine of Braganza. The great diarist Samuel Pepys recorded that she was the greatest beauty he ever saw. She had numerous suitors, including the Duke of Buckingham and Francis Digby, son of the Earl of Bristol, whose unrequited love for her was celebrated by Dryden. Her beauty appeared to her contemporaries to be equaled only by her childish silliness; but her letters to her husband, preserved in the British Museum, are not devoid of good sense and feeling. The Count de Gramont said of her that \\"it would be difficult to imagine less brain combined with more beauty.\\" While a member of the royal court, she caught the eye of Charles II, who fell in love with her. The king's infatuation was so great that when the queen's life was despaired of in 1663, it was reported that he intended to marry Stewart, and four years later he was considering the possibility of obtaining a divorce to enable him to make her his wife because she had refused to become his mistress. Eventually, in March 1667, she married (as his third wife) Charles Stewart, 3rd Duke of Richmond, 6th Duke of Lennox (1639‚Äì1672), a fourth cousin of King Charles II, but produced no issue. It is possible she had to elope, after being discovered with him by Lady Castlemaine, a rival for the king's affections. The now Duchess of Richmond, however, soon returned to court, where she remained for many years; and although she was disfigured by smallpox in 1669, she retained her hold on the king's affections. It is certain, at least, that Charles went on to post the Duke to Scotland and then to Denmark as ambassador, where he died in 1672. The duchess was present in 1688 at the birth of James Francis Edward Stuart (\\"The Old Pretender\\"), son of James II, and was one of those who signed the certificate before the council. She died in 1702 aged 55, leaving a valuable property to her nephew Alexander Stuart, 5th Lord Blantyre, whose seat of Lethington was renamed Lennoxlove after her. Britannia Britannia depicted on the reverse of a 1936 penny. Following the war with the Dutch, Charles had a commemorative medal cast, in which her face was used as a model for Britannia; this subsequently became customary for medals, coins and statues. She continued to appear on some of the copper coinage of the United Kingdom until the decimalization of the currency in 1971. She also appeared on the fifty pence piece in 2006.

Accessed on Google Books 2013-01-24. He was born in Mogilev, then part of the Russian Empire, now in Belarus, into a Jewish family. He studied at the Moscow Conservatory and emigrated to the United States in 1893. In 1903 Altschuler organized the Russian Symphony Orchestra Society of New York City, which for two decades toured the United States featuring performances and compositions by leading contemporary Russians. Among the Orchestra's notable premieres were Sergei Prokofiev Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 1 in D-flat major, Op. 10, which was performed at Carnegie Hall in New York on December 10, 1918 and Mussorgsky's Prelude to Khovanshchina, which Altschuler presented at Carnegie Hall on February 25, 1905. The Orchestra was among the first established orchestral ensembles to record for the gramophone; Columbia discs of short pieces by Tchaikovsky, Eduard Lassen and others date from about 1910. Nathaniel Shilkret, a member of the Orchestra, notes in his autobiographyShilkret, Nathaniel, ed.

Shilkret also noted that the Orchestra \\"played for the great ballerina Pavlova and her partner Mordkin [1910].\\" Despite his rigorous classical training, Altschuler was not averse to modernist experimentation. The Symphony's March 1915 New York premiere of Alexander Scriabin's Promethee: Le Poeme de Feu (Prometheus: The Poem of Fire) with Marguerite Volavy as pianist, featured a newly invented device, the chromola, which rendered musical tones in color . After disbanding the orchestra on the eve of the first World War, Altschuler moved to California, where he built a notable reputation as a teacher and performer. With help from his cousin, film executive Joe Aller, he composed and performed in film scores, including The Sea Hawk (1924), Dawn to Dawn (1933), It's All in Your mind (1938), Buffalo Bill Rides Again (1947), and Song of My Heart (1948), He was also active in southern California's musical community.

Brown and Otto Rank.* It was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction in 1974, two months after the author's death. Background The premise of The Denial of Death is that human civilization is ultimately an elaborate, symbolic defense mechanism against the knowledge of our mortality, which in turn acts as the emotional and intellectual response to our basic survival mechanism. Becker argues that a basic duality in human life exists between the physical world of objects and a symbolic world of human meaning. Thus, since humanity has a dualistic nature consisting of a physical self and a symbolic self, we are able to transcend the dilemma of mortality through heroism, by focusing our attention mainly on our symbolic selves. This symbolic self-focus takes the form of an individual's \\"immortality project\\" (or \\"causa sui project\\"), which is essentially a symbolic belief-system that ensures oneself is believed superior to physical reality. By successfully living under the terms of the immortality project, people feel they can become heroic and, henceforth, part of something eternal: something that will never die as compared to their physical body. This, in turn, gives people the feeling that their lives have meaning, a purpose, and are significant in the grand scheme of things. Immortality projects are one way that people manage death anxiety. Some people, however, will keep themselves drunk or use drugs to escape their anxiety in the face of death.Becker, Ernest, ‚ÄúThe Denial of Death‚Äù Chapter 1. Others will try to manage the terror of death by ignoring the problem and by ‚Äútranquilizing oneself with the trivial‚Äù (a term Becker borrowed from Kierkegaard). Becker describes the success of the Christian world picture as being able to take ‚Äúslaves, cripples... the simple and the mighty‚Äù and turn them into heroes of their own story by looking beyond this world to the heavenly realm where they will be rewarded for their heroism by God and live with Him forever.Becker, Ernest, ‚ÄúThe Denial of Death‚Äù chapter 8. Becker argues that the arbitrariness of human-invented immortality projects makes them naturally prone to conflict. When one immortality project conflicts with another, it is essentially an accusation of 'wrongness of life', and so sets the context for both aggressive and defensive behavior. Each party will want to prove its belief system is superior, a better way of life. Thus these immortality projects are considered a fundamental driver of human conflict, such as in wars, bigotry, genocide, and racism.Summary of Ernest Becker's, The Denial of DeathReason and Meaning Another theme running throughout the book is that humanity's traditional \\"hero-systems\\", such as religion, are no longer convincing in the age of reason. However, he argued the loss of religion leaves humanity with impoverished resources for necessary illusions. Science attempts to serve as an immortality project, something that Becker believes it can never do because it is unable to provide agreeable, absolute meanings to human life. The book states that we need new convincing \\"illusions\\" that enable us to feel heroic in ways that are agreeable. Becker, however, does not provide any definitive answer, mainly because he believes that there is no perfect solution. Instead, he hopes that gradual realization of humanity's innate motivations, namely death, can help to bring about a better world. Mental illness Becker concludes the introductory section of a chapter where he offers \\"A General View of Mental Illness\\" with the summary observation that \\"mental illness represents styles of bogging-down in the denial of creatureliness\\" that is part and parcel of immortality projects.* =Depression= At one extreme, people experiencing depression have the sense that their immortality project is failing. They either begin to think the immortality project is false or feel unable to successfully be a hero in terms of that immortality project. As a result, they are consistently reminded of their mortality, biological body, and feelings of worthlessness.* =Schizophrenia= At the other extreme, Becker describes schizophrenia as a state in which a person becomes so obsessed with his or her personal immortality project as to altogether deny the nature of all other realities. Schizophrenics create their own internal, mental reality in which they define and control all purposes, truths, and meanings. This makes them pure heroes, living in a mental reality that is taken as superior to both physical and cultural realities.* Creativity Like the schizophrenic, creative and artistic individuals deny both physical reality and culturally-endorsed immortality projects, expressing a need to create their own reality. The primary difference is that creative individuals have talents that allow them to create and express a reality that others may appreciate, rather than simply constructing an internal, mental reality.* Reception The Denial of Death has been praised for its post-Freudian approach to psychoanalysis, and has been criticized for its reductive depictions of mental health and humanity. The book helped to inspire a revival of interest in the work of the Austrian psychoanalyst Otto Rank. The book has also had a wide cultural impact beyond the fields of psychology and philosophy. The book made an appearance in Woody Allen's film Annie Hall, when the death-obsessed character Alvy Singer buys it for his girlfriend Annie. It was referred to by Spalding Gray in his work It's a Slippery Slope. Former United States President Bill Clinton quoted The Denial of Death in his 2004 autobiography My Life; he also included it as one of 21 titles in his list of favorite books. The playwright Ayad Akhtar mentions it in his Pulitzer Prize- winning play Disgraced.

It was located in the present-day French d√©partements of the Bas-Rhin and the Vosges and was one of a number of partitions of Salm. History Salm-Salm was created as a partition of Salm-Dhaun in 1574, and was raised from a County to a Principality in 1739 after being inherited and renamed by Count Nicholas Leopold of Salm-Hoogstraten. Salm-Salm was partitioned between itself and Salm-Neuweiler in 1608. The last territorial partition occurred in 1751, when Salm-Salm reorganized its borders with the Duchy of Lorraine. In 1790, after the French Revolution, the princes of Salm fled the territory and moved to their castle in Anholt, Westphalia. Salm-Salm then was besieged by the revolutionary army, which blocked food supplies from reaching the state. As a consequence, the population was forced to surrender to France. On March 2, 1793, the French National Convention declared Salm-Salm to be a part of the French Republic and attached it to the D√©partment of the Vosges. This was recognized by the Holy Roman Empire in the Peace of Lun√©ville of 1801. Some years later, in 1802/1803, together with Salm-Kyrburg, the prince of Salm-Salm was granted new territories formerly belonging to the Bishops of M√ºnster (Westphalia). The new territory was governed in union with Salm-Kyrburg and was known as the Principality of Salm. Geography In 1165, the original County of Salm was divided into the counties of Lower Salm, in the Ardennes, and the county of Upper Salm, situated in the Vosges mountains. In 1738, the County of Upper Salm was elevated to Principality of Salm-Salm. The capital of Salm-Salm was first Badonviller, and from 1751 on, Senones. The second part of the name of Salm-Salm derives from Salm Castle near Salm (today La Broque). At the end of its existence, Salm-Salm had an area of about 200 km¬≤ and 10,000 inhabitants. It was separated from the main part of the Holy Roman Empire when most of Alsace was ceded to France in the 17th century. Until 1766, it was bordered by the Duchy of Lorraine to the west and by France to the east. After Lorraine became a part of France on 24 February 1766, Salm-Salm formed an exclave of the Holy Roman Empire surrounded by French territory. The economy of Salm-Salm was mainly based on an iron mine near Grandfontaine.

It is served by Sydney Trains T1 Western and T5 Cumberland line services. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History Eastbound view in January 2012 The Richmond line opened on 1 December 1864 as a rural branch line in response to the area's success as a farming district and its location at the intersection of two stock routes.Richmond Station NSWrail.net In 1856, a petition for the establishment of a railway from the residents of Windsor and Richmond had been presented to the Government. In 1860 a grant of (Pounds)57,000 was approved for a railway between Blacktown and Windsor. In the following year it was increased to (Pounds)60,000 for a railway between Blacktown and Richmond. Contracts for earthworks, permanent ways and bridges were let from 1862. The line was opened on 29 November 1864 by Governor Sir John Young. A pilot engine was run before all passenger trains for safety. The original stations were Riverstone, Mulgrave, Windsor and Richmond. Upgrade to the track took place in the late nineteenth century. A major upgrading of most stations on the line occurred in the 1880s, including Richmond. The present brick platform building dates from 1881, prior to the opening of Windsor station, although the two station buildings are almost identical. On 8 December 1926, the line was extended to Kurrajong with the line leaving from Platform 1, then going across the corner of Richmond Park and along the side of March Street. This extension closed on 26 July 1952 after a landslide near Kurrajong during heavy rain. Having low levels of traffic its restoration could not be justified. Little evidence of it now remains.Richmond Railway Station Group NSW Environment & Heritage The early decades of the 20th century brought further improvements and upgrades to the line. These included the establishment of RAAF Base Richmond in 1925, which resulted in a significant increase in the use of the line. A skillion roof signal box was constructed . In 1938 congestion at Clarendon railway station caused by a RAAF Air Show resulted in extensive improvements. All station platforms were increased to 450 feet and additional facilities were installed at Richmond. 1940s plans show proposed additions and alterations to the station in the Inter-war functionalist style and stockyards in the precinct. The station additions were not completed. An undated plan shows a goods shed opposite the station, a turntable and a carriage shed and an engine shed. Water tanks and coal loading facilities are also shown (no longer extant), and a gate keepers cottage on the Sydney side of the level crossing near East Richmond Railway Station. During the 1950s a detached cleaners' building was erected at the rear of the platform building. An engine shed was demolished in 1983. There no longer appears to be any evidence of the former yard as the area around the station has been developed for purposes such as carparking and a McDonald's. As part of the electrification of the line from Riverstone in 1991, the yard was remodeled with the current train storage sidings laid on the northern side of the station and removal of tracks from the southern side.\\"Electric trains reach Richmond\\" Railway Digest September 1991 page 311 In 1996 all rooms to the station building were internally altered, except the General Waiting Room. Externally, the building is largely unaltered. At around 10am on Monday 22 January 2018 8-car Waratah train A42 arriving at Richmond Platform 2 overran the buffers, resulting in at least 16 serious injuries and the 3rd car to be jacked up. This Waratah set was then sent to Cardiff to be repaired, and has re-entered service with the front carriage replaced with a spare.'Almighty bang': Passengers injured after train crashes into barricade at Richmond station The Age 22 January 2018 Platforms & services Transport links Busways operate seven routes to and from Richmond station: *668: to Windsor station via Freemans Reach *675A: to Windsor station via Bligh Park *675C: to Windsor station via RAAF Base Richmond *677: to Penrith station via Londonderry *678: to Penrith station via Castlereagh *680: to Bowen Mountain *682: to Kurrajong or Berambing Richmond station is served by one NightRide route: *N71: to City (Town Hall) Trackplan Track layout  Description  The Richmond station precinct includes a type 3, second-class station building with a brick-faced platform (1881), the remnants of a brick dock platform and the remains of the Kurrajong line (both 1926), and a cleaning store (1950). =Station building (1881)= The brick station building is a type 3 \\"Second Class\\" station building dating to 1881. It is a symmetrical building on a centre access with wings at both ends of the building. It has a slate hipped roof with a centre transverse gable. The three painted brick chimneys are a striking feature with their decorative stone and arched chimney pots. The windows are generally timber double hung with stone or concrete lintels and sills. Transom lights are located above most of the timber four panel doors, although some have been removed to accommodate services such as air-conditioning. Painted decorative dentilated mouldings are located at the top of the walls under the eaves. The exterior is punctuated with a variety of new services and signs related to the daily operations of the station. The Platform 1 side has a corrugated iron sheeted ogee verandah roof supported on timber columns with sandstone bases that extends only partway along the building. The Platform 2 side has a skillion roofed verandah with decorative iron columns and brackets that extend along the entirety of the central section of the building. It is also sheeted in corrugated style metal sheeting. Modern seating, ticket machines, garbage bins and gardens are located at various locations. The female toilets located on the platform have what appear to be restored early marble and timber station signs hung on the exterior walls. Internally, the building retains its historic character despite the 1990s refurbishment. Internal detailing includes some mini orb ceilings, ceiling roses, blocked up fireplaces with timber surrounds, moulded plaster cornices, timber window and door frames, architraves and skirtings. Many services are surface mounted. The station building is in good condition apart from a few minor issues on Platform 2 near the ticket window where a waterpipe appears to have created some ongoing damp issues to the base of the building that have resulted in mortar degradation and flaking paint. It is also evident that repointing works carried out with hard cement mortar resulted in some deterioration on brick substrate. Externally the building has a high degree of integrity and intactness. Internally, considerable reorganisation has taken place. However, the overall character of the station remains intact. The removal of the associated rail yard components of the site reduces its ability to demonstrate this element of its history. =Cleaning store (1950)= A flat roofed, detached brick building which has been constructed as a cleaners room stands between the station building and the edge of Platform 1. It was assessed as being in good condition at the time of heritage listing. =Platform (1881)= Richmond Station has a brick faced island platform with concrete deck and asphalt finish. Modern buffers are located at the end of the rail line. White aluminium palisade fencing has been erected around the station and pedestrian crossing at the end of the line as a safety barrier. =Dock platform (1926)= The dock platform remains as a brick and grassed island in the middle of the northern carpark. It was assessed as being in moderate condition at the time of heritage listing. =Kurrajong line and yard remains (1926)= The former Kurrajong line sidings, former sidings, stock yards, turntable and engine shed appear to be visible under the car park which has been topped with asphalt surface. Remnants may survive below the new surface. =Landscape features= There are a number of mature trees and plantings on the eastern side of the platform that add to the significant setting of the station. = Modifications and dates = * 1890 - Kitchen erected at gate house. * 1897 - Engine shed extended. * 1900 - Carriage shelter shed provided. * 1903 - Station Master's house damaged by fire. * 1908 - Platform extended. * 1909 - Purchase of land to extend the yard. * 1912 - Platform extended. * 1914 - Rest house erected. * 1916 - Interlocked. * 1923 - Runround loop laid in at platform. * 1925 - Turntable site relocated. * 1927 - An additional water column installed. * 1950s - A detached cleaners' building was erected at the rear of the platform building. * 1952 - Water tank transferred to Dunheved. * 1957 - Providing lighting at the water column, coal stage and in the engine shed. * 1967 - 600 Class two-car diesel train introduced on branch. * 1971 - Last steam passenger service ran. * 1984 - Engine shed removed. * 1987 - Gate house demolished. * 1996 - All rooms were internally altered and some given new uses, except the general Waiting Room. The yard and evidence of the Kurrajong line appears to have been entirely removed except for an additional line behind Platform 1. Some minor changes have been made to some doors, windows and signage of the Station. The skillion roof signal box appears to have been demolished.  Heritage listing  Richmond Railway Station is of state significance as an early railway station dating from 1867 that was instrumental in opening up the farming district of the Hawkesbury to provide transport for fresh produce to the Sydney markets. The 1880s station building is a fine example of a Victorian second-class station building and provides evidence of the prosperity and growth of Richmond following the arrival of the railway during the nineteenth century. The station remains as the terminus for the Richmond Branch Line and is significant as a landmark in the historic town and for its continuity of use for over 140 years. The Kurrajong siding is significant as evidence of the former branch line which operated between Richmond and Kurrajong from 1926 - 1952. Richmond railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Richmond Station has historical significance as the termination point for the Sydney metropolitan railway system in that direction dating from 1867, with no continuation of train services by other providers. The station was instrumental in opening up the farming district of Hawkesbury to provide transport for fresh produce to Sydney markets. The existing station building is historically significant as an early station building from the 1880s and for its association with the upgrade of the Richmond line in the 1880s. Remnant dock platform and shadow siding to the rear are one of the few remaining pieces of evidence of the Kurrajong line that operated between 1926 and 1952. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Richmond Railway Station is aesthetically significant as a fine example of the architecture of larger railway station buildings in the late nineteenth century demonstrating key characteristics of a Victorian second-class station building. It retains most of its original external detailing and provides evidence of the prosperity and growth of Richmond following the arrival of the railway. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place, and can provide a connection to the local community's past. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The station building is rare as one of three larger, significant station buildings built on the Richmond line in the 1880s, the others being at Windsor and Riverstone. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The station is one of three larger, significant station buildings built on the Richmond line in the 1880s, the others being at Windsor and Riverstone. These differ significantly from the smaller, simpler stations built elsewhere on the line. The station building is a fine example of a late nineteenth century station building, representing the peak of achievement in station architecture that is known as second-class station building. = Attribution = References External links Richmond Station details Transport for New South Wales Category:Easy Access railway stations in Sydney Category:Railway stations in Sydney Category:Railway stations in Australia opened in 1864 Category:Richmond, New South Wales Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:Richmond railway line ","title":"Richmond railway station, Sydney"},{"id":"1967030","text":"Salm-Reifferscheidt-Raitz was a noble family of German descent established in Central Moravia (now part of the Czech Republic).

An individual who acts in this capacity is generally called a guardian ad litem in such legal proceedings; in Scotland, curator ad litem is the equivalent term. In England and Wales, since the amendment of the Children Act 1989 established the role of children's guardian, the term is now used only in the term \\"guardian ad litem in Private Law proceedings under rule 9.5. The United States legal system, which at its inception was based on the English legal system, continues to use the terms \\"guardian ad litem and \\"attorney ad litem. The legal system in the Republic of Ireland also uses the term guardian ad litem. The term is also used in property litigation, where a person may be appointed to act on behalf of an estate in court proceedings, when the estate's proper representatives are unable or unwilling to act. The term is also sometimes used to refer to a judge who participates in only a particular case or a limited set of cases and does not have the same status as the other judges of the court. Such a jurist is more commonly called a judge ad hoc. Judges ad hoc are particularly common in international courts, and are fewer in number elsewhere.

They live in the eastern part of the Niger Delta, Rivers State, Bonny District; part of them in the Defaka ward of Nkoroo town in close relationship with the Nkoroo people, and another part of them on the isolated island of Iwoma Nkoro, near Kono. Present neighbours of the Defaka, apart from the Nkoroo people, are: at Iwoma, the Ogoni people (speakers of Ogoni/Kana/Khana), and to the east, the Obolo. The Defaka have a less cordial relationship with these peoples than with the Nkoroo. The Defaka language is thought to be most closely related to the Ijo languages, which is the basis for the Ijoid language family first proposed by Jenewari (1983). Defaka is being rapidly pushed to extinction as speakers are shifting to the language of the Nkoroo people. All Defaka people speak Nkoroo; most use it as their primary language, even when talking with other Defaka speakers. At most 200 speakers of Defaka are left, mostly elderly people; as such, the language may already be moribund (or nearly so). History The Defaka have always been a people small in number, and their history is a long narrative of harassment by numerically superior neighbours and subsequent migrations. According to oral histories reported in Jenewari (1983), the original home of the Defaka was in the Iselema area (present-day Delta State). From there, they moved via the Central Delta into the Eastern Delta region, where they lived close to the Abuloma people in the Okrika territory. Later they lived close to the Udekama (Degema) people in the Engenni area, and subsequently they entered the Bonny territory to live at Abalama Olotombia, and later near Bodo in Ogoni. They moved to Iyoba in the Andoni country before establishing Olomama Nkoroo (Old town). From there, they finally moved to the present-day Nkoroo town. The Nkoroo people, neighbours of the Defaka and numbering about 4500, relate a similar tradition of migration. Thus, the Defaka and Nkoroo peoples have presumably been living together as neighbours prior to the establishment of Nkoroo town, perhaps even since the time that both of them were in the Okrika territory.

He played in the National Football League (NFL) from 1970 to 1979 for the Buffalo Bills, Houston Oilers, Los Angeles Rams, Seattle Seahawks, and San Francisco 49ers. Cowlings was taken fifth overall in the first round by the Buffalo Bills in the 1970 NFL Draft.Marcin (1971), p. 56. Ebony (Nov 1974), p. 170. Ebony (Nov 1977), pp. 170‚Äì172. Cowlings is most famous for his role in aiding his close friend O. J. Simpson in fleeing from the police on June 17, 1994, after Simpson's ex-wife and her friend were found murdered. After leading police on a low-speed chase, Cowlings drove Simpson back to his home where he was arrested. Cowlings himself was arrested for aiding Simpson in the chase, but charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. Early life Cowlings was born on June 16, 1947, in San Francisco, and was raised in its Potrero Hill neighborhood. There, he was a member of the Superiors social club, which held meetings at the Booker T. Washington Community Center. He attended Galileo High School, where he played football with O. J. Simpson. He and Simpson became friends.de Lama, George (June 21, 1994) \\"Cowlings, Simpson Inseparable, Even As Teens.\\" Chicago Tribune. (Retrieved January 7, 2014.)Wolf, Craig (June 19, 1994) \\"The Simpson Case: The Friend; A Lifelong Loyalty, True to the End.\\" New York Times. (Retrieved January 7, 2014.) After high school, the pair attended City College of San Francisco, where they played on the football team. Football career Cowlings was named an All-American defensive tackle after his senior year at the University of Southern California (USC).http://beckys-place.com/cowlings.html During his senior year, the 1969 Trojan team went undefeated, and Cowlings led a powerful defensive line, which was nicknamed \\"The Wild Bunch\\" after the movie of the same name. Cowlings was drafted fifth in the first round of the 1970 NFL Draft by the Buffalo Bills. He was a starter his first three years in Buffalo, but he was traded to Houston Oilers after the 1972 season. He played all 14 games for the Oilers in both 1973 and 1974, but he played just five games in 1975 for the Rams. In 1976, he became a charter member of the Seattle Seahawks, after being signed off the waiver wire when the Rams released him at the end of the pre-season. He played just one game, due to an injury he suffered while playing for the Rams in an exhibition game against the Seahawks. He returned to the Rams in 1977, Played with CFL Montreal Alouettes 1978, and finished his career in 1979 with the San Francisco 49ers. Acting career Cowlings' first film role was in the 1985 film Bubba Until It Hurts, starring Bubba Smith. He had a recurring minor role as Coach Nabors in the HBO football sitcom 1st & Ten, which also starred Simpson. Cowlings also served as a technical football advisor on the football scenes in the 1991 Tony Scott film, The Last Boy Scout. O. J. Simpson Cowlings was a close friend of O. J. Simpson, whom he has known since childhood. They were teammates at Galileo High School, San Francisco City College, USC, the Buffalo Bills, and the San Francisco 49ers. Cowlings dated Simpson's first wife Marguerite Whitley while they were attending Galileo High School and when they were having issues as a couple, Simpson stepped in as a mediator, but the discussion turned into a relationship and they would eventually marry in 1967; Cowlings was reportedly angry at the time, but their friendship prevailed. They remained close friends and confidants through the years, with Cowlings being the godfather of Simpson's son Jason and a groomsman at Simpson and Brown's wedding in February 1985. Cowlings was also the ring bearer at mutual friends Robert and Kris Kardashian's wedding in July 1978. Following the murders of Nicole Brown and her friend Ronald Goldman on June 12, 1994, in which Simpson was a person of interest, Brown's funeral took place in the St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church in Brentwood on June 16, Cowlings' 47th birthday; Cowlings served as a gatekeeper and pallbearer at the funeral. The next day, despite agreeing to turn himself into the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), Simpson failed to surrender at the Parker Center station. Later that day, witnesses reported seeing Simpson riding in a white Ford Bronco, a vehicle owned and being driven by Cowlings, thus becoming the object of a low-speed chase by police cruisers on the freeways. During the chase, Cowlings made a 911 call from a cell phone and claimed that Simpson was armed with a gun pointed to his own head, demanding that Cowlings drive him to Simpson's estate in Brentwood, or Simpson would kill himself. The slow-speed chase was televised on live TV from helicopter. It interrupted coverage of the 1994 NBA Finals, and was viewed by approximately 95 million people in the United States alone. During the chase, Cowlings famously told the police: \\"My name is A.C., you know who I am, God damn it!\\" The chase ended at Simpson's Brentwood home, where Simpson eventually surrendered to police after a nearly hour-long wait.Bugliosi (1997), p. 126. When the chase concluded and Cowlings and Simpson finally surrendered, Cowlings was arrested and charged with a felony for aiding a fugitive. He was taken to the Los Angeles men's jail, and was released approximately 12 hours after his arrest on $250,000 bail. District Attorney Gil Garcetti eventually determined, however, that Cowlings would not be charged due to a lack of sufficient evidence. During Simpson's criminal trial, Cowlings surprised the media with a press conference held a block from the courthouse. Cowlings retained Beverly Hills public relations firm, Edward Lozzi & Associates, to conduct the press conference, without revealing the reason or itinerary. Lozzi introduced Cowlings and Cowlings's attorney, Donald Re. Cowlings then announced he had created a 900 phone number for the public to ask him questions‚Äîabout anything except the murder and trial. Cowlings read a one-minute prepared statement announcing the 900 number, which was simultaneously unveiled visually in the room. Reports that Cowlings realized over a million dollars from this $2-dollars-plus-a-minute 900 number could never be verified. Under oath in his deposition for Simpson's civil trial, Cowlings stated that the 900 number endeavor just \\"broke even.\\" This press conference was the only time Cowlings officially spoke to the media about anything related to the Simpson case. Former porn star and ex-girlfriend Jennifer Peace, who testified before a grand jury, claimed that Cowlings had confessed to her that a hysterical Simpson had called him on the night of the murders and that the murder weapon had been disposed of; Cowlings denied the allegations. https://heavy.com/entertainment/2016/06/al-cowlings-oj-simpson- now-wife-today-murder-trial-white-bronco/ Following the acquittal of Simpson in October 1995, the families of Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman filed a civil suit against Simpson for wrongful death. Cowlings was subpoenaed and during both the deposition and trial took the Fifth Amendment when asked what he was doing between June 13, 1994, when Simpson returned from Chicago, and the freeway chase on June 17, 1994, as he could still be charged for aiding and abetting. However, he testified that he had seen Simpson throw out Brown's clothes from their apartment during an argument in 1979 and that while he was driving Brown to a hospital on New Year's Eve 1989, she told him Simpson hit her, which (along with Brown's recorded 911 calls, pictures of her with bruises, and similar witness testimonies that concern physical aggression on Simpson's part against Brown) contradicted Simpson's civil trial testimony that he had never been abusive during their marriage. Simpson was found liable for both deaths in February 1997. =Bronco= In 1994, Cowlings' 1993 Ford Bronco from the low-speed chase was purchased by Simpson's former sports agent Mike Gilbert and two other men, then ended up sitting in a parking garage for the next 17 years (1995-2012), where it was rarely used. As of 2017, the vehicle was on loan to the Alcatraz East Crime Museum where it was put on display as part of an exhibit on the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Personal life Cowlings is a member of the 2009 USC Athletic Hall of Fame class along with Junior Seau, Rodney Peete, and John Robinson. USC's Cowlings Residential College is named in his honor. In 2012, Fox News examined the lives of key individuals in the Simpson case and found that Cowlings was reportedly working as a handbag sales representative. In 2014, an ex-teammate told USA Today that Cowlings worked for B. Wayne Hughes, founder of Public Storage. Six months later, USA Today quoted retired tennis player and friend of Cowlings, Joe Kolkowitz, saying that Cowlings had retired and is still living in Southern California. According to TMZ in 2016, Cowlings had reportedly threatened to sue FX if he was portrayed negatively in the critically acclaimed series The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story, in which he is portrayed by Malcolm-Jamal Warner. In March 2018, O.J. Simpson (after his parole for armed robbery and kidnapping) stated that he may have chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease common in athletes that have suffered numerous head wounds or concussions. Simpson said that close friends and former teammates, including Cowlings, also struggle with the symptoms of CTE.

The genus contains only one species, viz. Sherardia arvensis or (blue) field madder, which is widespread across most of Europe and northern Africa as well as southwest and central Asia (from Turkey to Saudi Arabia to Kazakhstan) and Macaronesia (Canary Islands, Azores, Madeira, Savage Islands). It is also reportedly naturalized in Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Kerguelen, Ethiopia, Sudan, southern Africa, Mexico, Costa Rica, South America, Bermuda, Cuba, Haiti and much of Canada and the United States (especially the Pacific States and the lower Mississippi Valley).Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, Sherardia arvensis Altervista Flora Italiana, Sherardia arvensis Biota of North America Program, Galium sherardia (synonym of Sherardia arvensis) Description Sherardia arvensis is an annual plant with trailing and upright stems growing up to 40 cm long, having a square cross-section. The rough pointed bristly leaves of about 1 cm in length are in whorls of four to six (normally six at the ends of the shoots, but four nearer the root). The tiny pale lilac or pink flowers are approximately 3 mm in diameter and have a long tube, with only the end part of the four petals free. The flowers grow in clusters of two or three together in an involucral structure formed out of a ring of six bracts. The fruit are dry and about 3 mm long with two lobes giving rise to the two seeds (nutlets). The four-angled stems with whorls of bristly leaves and tiny flowers are reminiscent of the Bedstraws and other related Rubiaceae, but Sherardia is distinguished by its mauve/pink flowers that are organized in clusters and having a long corolla tube. Sherardia arvensis plants are hermaphroditic and pollinated by flies.Plants for a Future - Sherardia arvensis Uses Sherardia arvensis is a common weed of fields, pasture, grassland, and disturbed areas. The fleshy roots, though much inferior to the common madder (Rubia tinctorum), are sometimes used for the production of a red dye. Taxonomy The genus and species were described by Carl Linnaeus in Hortus Cliffortianus in 1736 and also appeared in his masterwork Species Plantarum in 1753. The genus was named in memory of the prominent English botanist William Sherard (1659‚Äì1728). The Latin epithet arvensis means that it is found in fields.

The length from the front of the Garratt locomotive to the driver's position contributed to a misjudgment of standing clear of the mainline. 3817 collided with the Garratt locomotive at an estimated speed of . The fouling point, as was common practice at the time, was marked by a white lamp on a white post located quite close to the actual fouling point. The points at the entrance to the loop were operated by a ground frame and interlocked with signals using annett keys. There were no track circuits over the points which might have detected the foul locomotive and thus held the home signal at \\"red\\" and thus stopped the mail train short of the obstruction. The impact of the two locomotives colliding forced the Garratt into the side of the silo and reared up its boiler section on to its leading water unit. 3817 was derailed and pushed over on to its side. Three carriages of the Mail train were also derailed. The collision damaged approximately of track on the main line and loop and the line was not reopened for another three days.  Damages  A total of 19 passengers aboard the Mail train were injured. Due to the considerable damage to both locomotives and the decline of steam traction then under way, neither 6003 nor 3817 returned to service.

He was a member of the Whitney family. Early life Helen Hay Whitney and her six-year-old son, John Hay Whitney (October 12, 1910) Whitney was born on August 17, 1904, in Ellsworth, Maine, Whitney was a descendant of John Whitney, a Puritan who settled in Massachusetts in 1635, as well as of William Bradford, who came over on the Mayflower. His father was Payne Whitney, and his grandfathers were William C. Whitney and John Hay, both presidential cabinet members. His mother was Helen Hay Whitney. The Whitneys' family mansion, Payne Whitney House on New York's Fifth Avenue, was around the corner from James B. Duke House, home of the founder of the American Tobacco Co., father of Doris Duke. Whitney's uncle, Oliver Hazard Payne, a business partner of John D. Rockefeller, arranged the funding for Duke to buy out his competitors. Jock Whitney attended Groton School, then Yale College. He joined Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Phi chapter), as his father had. Whitney, his father, grandfather, and great-uncle were oarsmen at Yale, and his father was captain of the crew in 1898. He was a member of Scroll and Key. While at Yale, he inspired the coining of the term \\"crew cut\\" for the haircut favored by the rowing crew which still bears the name.Schiff, J.A. \\"John Hay Whitney ‚Äì Philanthropist, Film Producer, and Father of the Crew Cut\\", by Judith Ann Schiff, Yale Alumni Magazine, April 2002. After graduating in 1926, Whitney went to Oxford University, but the death of his father necessitated his returning home. He inherited a trust fund of $20 million (approximately $210 million in 2005 dollars), and later inherited four times that amount from his mother. Career =Business career= In 1929, Whitney, despite his vast wealth, was a clerk at the firm of Lee, Higginson & Co where, through his boss, J.T. Claiborne, Jr., he met former Lee, Higginson clerk Langbourne Meade Williams, Jr., who had come to Claiborne for help in his efforts to gain control of Freeport Texas Co. Williams was a scion of a founding investment firm in the sulfur mining company. In 1929, the year after Whitney became one of the wealthiest men in America, through inheritance, Williams enlisted the help of Whitney's boss, who then enlisted Whitney's financial participation, in his efforts to oust founder and Chairman Eric P. Swenson, casting Whitney in the role of corporate raider before the term existed. Whitney was soon Freeport's biggest shareholder, enabling Williams to replace the chairman and his management team. Claiborne was made a Vice-President; Williams became Freeport's president in 1933, and Whitney was appointed Chairman of the Board.Peas, L, et al The assassinations: Probe magazine on JFK, MLK, RFK and Malcolm X, by James DiEugenio, Lisa Pease and Judge Joe Brown, 2003. . In 1946, Whitney founded J.H. Whitney & Company, the oldest venture capital firm in the U.S., with Benno C. Schmidt, Sr.‚Äîwho coined the term \\"venture capital\\"‚Äîwith J. T. Claiborne as a partner. Whitney put up $10 million to finance entrepreneurs with business plans who were unwelcome at banks. Companies Whitney invested in included Spencer Chemical and Minute Maid. In 1958, while he was still ambassador to the United Kingdom, his company Whitney Communications Corp. bought the New York Herald Tribune, and was its publisher from 1961 to its closure in 1966. Whitney Communications also owned and operated other newspapers, magazines and broadcasting stations. Whitney's television stations were sold to Dun & Bradstreet in 1969. =Theatre and motion pictures= Whitney invested in several Broadway shows, including Peter Arno's 1931 revue Here Goes the Bride, a failure that cost him $100,000, but was more successful as one of the backers of Life with Father. An October 1934 Fortune article on the Technicolor Corporation noted Whitney's interest in pictures. He had met Technicolor head Herbert Kalmus at the Saratoga Race Course. In 1932, Technicolor achieved a breakthrough with its three-strip process. Merian C. Cooper of RKO Radio Pictures approached Whitney with the idea of investing in Technicolor. They joined forces and founded Pioneer Pictures in 1933, with a distribution deal with RKO to distribute Pioneer's films. Whitney and his cousin Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney bought a 15% stake in Technicolor. Whitney was also the major investor in David O. Selznick's production company Selznick International Pictures, putting up $870,000 and serving as Chairman of the Board. He put up half the money to option Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind for the Selznick film version, in which he then invested, and later in Rebecca (1940). =Military career= Whitney served in the United States Army Air Forces as an intelligence officer during World War II, assigned to the Office of Strategic Services. He was taken prisoner by the Germans in southern France, but escaped when the train transporting him to a POW camp came under Allied fire. =Thoroughbred horse racing= Time (March 27, 1933) Whitney inherited his family's love of horses, a predilection he shared with his sister, Joan Whitney Payson. Jock and his sister ran Greentree Stables in the U.S., owned by their mother. In 1928, he became the youngest member ever elected to The Jockey Club. Whitney and his first wife \\"Liz\\" raced horses both in the United States and in Europe. He owned Easter Hero who won the 1929 and 1930 editions of the Cheltenham Gold Cup. In the 1929 Grand National, his horse twisted a plate and was beaten by a nose at the finish. Although Whitney entered the Grand National annually, he never again came close to winning. The Whitneys entered four horses in the Kentucky Derby in the 1930s, \\"Stepenfetchit,\\" which finished 3rd in 1932, \\"Overtime,\\" which finished 5th in 1933, \\"Singing Wood,\\" which finished 8th in 1934, and \\"Heather Broom,\\" which finished 3rd in 1939. Jock Whitney was also an outstanding polo player, with a four-goal handicap, and it was as a sportsman that he made the cover of the March 27, 1933, issue of Time magazine. In 2015, Whitney was posthumously inducted to the National Museum of Racing's Hall of Fame as Pillar of the Turf. =Political life= Whitney was the major backer of Dwight D. Eisenhower. Eisenhower appointed him United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom, a post held sixty years earlier by Whitney's grandfather John Hay. Whitney played a major role in improving Anglo-American relations, which had been severely strained during the 1956 Suez Crisis, when Eisenhower demanded that the British, French and Israelis terminate their invasion of Egypt. Personal life In 1930, Whitney purchased the Llangollen estate as a bridal gift for his fianc√©e, the Pennsylvania socialite Mary Elizabeth \\"Liz\\" Altemus. It was a historic equestrian farm just outside Middleburg, Virginia. They were married on September 23, 1931. Although married to Altemus, Whitney was romantically linked to Tallulah Bankhead, Joan Bennett, Paulette Goddard and Joan Crawford. Clark Gable and Carole Lombard met at one of Whitney's parties. In the early 1930s, Jock Whitney began an affair with Nina Gore Vidal; at the same time Mary Altemus Whitney had an affair with Nina Vidal's husband Eugene Vidal. The couple divorced in 1940, but Liz Whitney remained at Llangollen for the rest of her life, becoming an internationally renowned horse breeder and a member of the Virginia Thoroughbred Association Hall of Fame. In 1942, he married Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, ex-wife of James Roosevelt, son of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and adopted her two daughters: *Kate Roosevelt Whitney *Sara Roosevelt Whitney (born March 13, 1932) Whitney met Fred Astaire in New York City while the former was a student at Yale University and they became lifelong friends, sharing a passion for horse racing. Whitney became a major investor in two of Astaire's Broadway stage vehicles, The Band Wagon (1930) and Gay Divorce (1932), and played a crucial role in securing for Astaire a contract with RKO Pictures in 1933, using his contacts with Merion C. Cooper - both men were board members of Pan American Airways whose planes were prominently featured in Astaire's breakthrough film with Ginger Rogers: Flying Down to Rio (1933). During the 1970s, Whitney was listed as one of the ten wealthiest men in the world. The residences at his disposal over the years included an estate on Long Island; an Atlantic Beach, NY beach house; Greenwood Plantation in Georgia; a townhouse and an elegant apartment in Manhattan; a large summer house on Fishers Island, near New London, Connecticut; a 12-room house in Saratoga Springs, which the Whitneys used when they attended horse races; a golfing cottage in Augusta, Georgia, where he was a member of the Augusta National Golf Club; and a spacious house Cherry Hill in Virginia Water, Surrey, England, near the Ascot Racecourse. Mr. Whitney also owned an estate in Aiken, South Carolina, which he considered his 'retirement' home and where he hoped to spend his final days. Whitney died on February 8, 1982 at North Shore Hospital, Manhasset, Long Island, after a long illness Philanthropy Payne Whitney made substantial gifts to Yale, to the New York Presbyterian Hospital, and the New York Public Library. After his father's death, the family built the Payne Whitney Gymnasium at Yale in his honor. The family also financed Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic at New York Presbyterian Hospital in 1932. Whitney created the John Hay Whitney Foundation for educational projects in 1946. The Foundation provided fellowships to the racially and culturally deprived. He became a major contributor to Yale University, where he served as a Fellow of the Corporation. In 1951, he and his wife Betsey Cushing Whitney donated land from their \\"Greentree\\" estate in Manhasset, New York toward the building of North Shore Hospital. Currently called North Shore University Hospital, it is the flagship hospital of the 3rd largest not-for-profit secular healthcare system in the United States, the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System. In 1953, Whitney received The Hundred Year Association of New York's Gold Medal Award \\"in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.\\" In the late 1960s/early 1970's John Hay Whitney donated two small parcels of land in Manhasset to the County of Nassau and to the Manhasset-Lakeville Volunteer Fire Department. The Nassau County parcel was the new home for the 6th Police Precinct of the Nassau County Police, located at the S/E intersection of Community Drive and East Community Drive. Just east of the 6th pct, at 2 E Community Dr., the M-LFD parcel was the new home of Fire Company #2 of the M-LFD, where John Hay Whitney was voted in by the membership of Company number two as an Honorary Member of the Company. =Museum of Modern Art= In 1930 Whitney was elected to the board of trustees of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and named President of the MoMA Film Library in 1935. In 1941 he succeeded Nelson A. Rockefeller as President of MoMA. In 1946 he succeeded Stephen C. Clark as Chairman of the Board of Trustees Art collection When Whitney moved to England as United States Ambassador, he took a number of his favourite artworks with him to enjoy during his posting. Before his return to the US, he agreed for the first time to loan part of his collection for the public to see. He provided the Tate Gallery with 56 paintings from the collection in England and specially brought in a further 11 paintings from the US. The exhibition, the John Hay Whitney Collection, ran from 16 December 1960 to 29 January 1961 In 1983 the National Gallery of Art, Washington held an exhibition of the John Hay Whitney Collection with paintings loaned by Whitney's wife, The Museum of Modern Art and Yale University Art Gallery Among the paintings in his collection, Jock Whitney's prized possession was the Bal au moulin de la Galette painted in 1876 by the French artist Pierre- Auguste Renoir. In 1990, his widow put the painting up for auction with Sotheby's, New York and it sold for US$78 million to Japanese businessman, Ryoei Saito. Whitney's widow donated a number of paintings from his collection to the Greentree Foundation. One of those paintings by Pablo Picasso, Gar√ßon √† la pipe was auctioned by Sotheby's in May 2004 for $104 million The following works have been publicly exhibited or sold from the former collection of John Hay Whitney. *Albert Marquet, The Beach at Trouville *Alfred de Dreux, Cheval Blanc Effraye Par L'orage *Alfred de Dreux, Moorish Groom *Andr√© Derain, Charing Cross Bridge *Andr√© Derain, Collioure Landscape *Balthus (Balthasar Klossowski): Le Salon *Bazille, Jean-Fr√©d√©ric: Pots De Fleurs *Bernard Perlin, Vacant Lots *Berthe Morisot, Hide and Seek (Cache-Cache) *Camille Pissarro, Jeanne with Flowers *Camille Pissarro, Pommes En Fleurs, Temps Gris, Eragny *Claude Monet, Bateaux Sur Le Galet *Claude Monet, Camille on the Beach *Edgar Degas, Avant la Course *Edgar Degas, Cheval de Selle *Edgar Degas, Chevaux de Course *Edgar Degas, La Promenade Des Chevaux *Edgar Degas, Le faux Depart *Edgar Degas, Le faux Depart (drawing) *Edgar Degas, Self Portrait *√âdouard Manet, Les Courses au Bois de Bologne *√âdouard Manet, Woman in a Decollete Gown *√âdouard Vuillard, An Artist *√âdouard Vuillard, Demoiselle en Rouge *√âdouard Vuillard, Embroiders near a Window (Tapestry) *√âdouard Vuillard, La M√®re De Vuillard En Profil *√âdouard Vuillard, Portrait of the Artist's Mother *Edward Hopper, Cape Cod Evening *Eug√®ne Boudin, Hollyhocks *Eug√®ne Boudin, Roses *George Bellows, Club Night *George Bellows, Crowd at Polo *George Bellows, Introducing John L.

A few years later roller skating was one of his most important dance numbers on film. Whitney and Jimmy Altemus provided the lyrics for a sing composed by Fred Astaire, \\"Tappin' the Time.\\" President Dwight D. Eisenhower took pains to transmit to Ambassador Whitney in London, by telegram, the first round golf scores of the Masters Tournament at the Augusta National Golf Club on 5 April 1957. Ambassador Whitney had a very demanding and exhausting scheduled but was not fazed by it. After having been to three or four receptions one day, his wife was not surprised to find their chauffeur, groggy from his rounds, dozing on the back seat of their limousine and the Ambassador driving the car. Whitney: \\"I have just had a heart attack and am on a very strict diet. However if you will twist my arm a little, I will probably give in and we will consume a number of very large dry martinis\\" William S. Paley (the legendary founder of CBS), who was Whitney's brother in law, had a gentle rivalry with Whitney. Once while watching television with Whitney at Greentree, Paley wanted to change the channel. 'Where's your clicker?' Paley asked, figuring Jock would have a remote-control switch at his fingertips. Jock calmly pressed a buzzer, and his butler walked up to the TV set to make the switch. The White House Is Nice, But It's No Greentree! E. J. Kahn, Mr. Whitney's biographer, reported that one of his daughters, Kate, once took her own children on a tour of the White House. Mr. Kahn wrote, After inspecting it, they pronounced it nice enough but hardly on a par with Greentree.

Opus Dei and the Popes Pope John XXIII lauded Opus Dei and said on 5 March 1960 that it opens up \\"unsuspected horizons of apostolate,\\" while Paul VI said that the Work is \\"an expression of the perennial youth of the Church, fully open to the exigencies of a modern apostolate.\\" (Handwritten letter to Msgr. Josemar√≠a Escriv√° de Balaguer, 1 October 1964) Before the start of his brief papacy, John Paul I said that Escriv√°'s teachings are \\"radical; he goes as far as talking about \\"materializing\\" in a good sense the quest for holiness. For him, it is the material work itself which must be turned into prayer and sanctity.\\" Cardinal Albino Luciani: Seeking God through ordinary work, Il Gazzettino (Venice), July 25, 1978 John Paul II stated ‚Äú[Opus Dei] has as its aim the sanctification of one‚Äôs life, while remaining within the world at one‚Äôs place of work and profession: to live the Gospel in the world, while living immersed in the world, but in order to transform it, and to redeem it with one‚Äôs personal love for Christ. This is truly a great ideal, which right from the beginning has anticipated the theology of the lay state, which is a characteristic mark of the Church of the Council and after the Council.‚Äù L‚ÄôOsservatore Romano, August 27, 1979.John McCloskey: The Pope and Opus Dei, Crisis Magazine, March, 1995 He established Opus Dei as a Personal Prelature in 1982 and the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross in 1990, and canonized its founder in 2002. He also said upon creating Opus Dei as a personal prelature, ‚ÄúWith very great hope, the Church directs its attention and maternal care to Opus Dei, which  by divine inspiration the Servant of God Josemar√≠a Escriv√° de Balaguer founded in Madrid on October 2, 1928, so that it may always be an apt and effective instrument of the salvific mission which the Church carries out for the life of the world. From its beginnings, this Institution has in fact striven, not only to illuminate with new lights the mission of the laity in the Church and in society, but also to put it into practice.‚Äù Ut Sit, November 1982 (the apostolic constitution by which Opus Dei was made a personal prelature of the Catholic Church in accord with Code of Canon Law sections 294-97). In an Address to Theological Study Convention on the Teaching of Blessed Josemaria Escriva, October 14, 1993, John Paul II stated: \\"In the 65 years since its foundation, the Prelature of Opus Dei, an indissoluble unity of priests and lay people, has contributed to making Christ's saving message resound in many walks of life. As Pastor of the universal Church, echoes of this apostolate reach me. I encourage all the members of the Prelature of Opus Dei to persevere in this work, in faithful continuity with the spirit of service to the Church which always inspired the life of your founder.\\" Benedict XVI, three years before becoming Pope, said \\"the theocentrism of Escriv√°...means this confidence in the fact that God is working now and we ought only to put ourselves at his disposal...This, for me, is a message of greatest importance. It is a message that leads to overcoming what could be considered the great temptation of our times: the pretense that after the 'big bang' God retired from history.\\" Catholic faith and Opus Dei teachings John Paul II said Opus Dei \\"anticipated the theology of the lay state, which is a characteristic mark of the Church of the Council and after the Council.\\" The Catholic Church's Second Vatican Council states: :\\"All the faithful, whatever their condition or state, are called by the Lord, each in his own way, to that perfect holiness whereby the Father Himself is perfect (Mt 5:48).\\" \\"It belongs to the laity to seek the kingdom of God by engaging in the affairs of the world and directing them according to God's will.\\" With Escriva's teaching that God comes close to us and we can cooperate with his plan of salvation, John Paul II said that \\"it is easier to understand what the Second Vatican Council affirmed: 'there is no question, then, of the Christian message inhibiting men from building up the world ... on the contrary it is an incentive to do these very things' (Vatican II, Gaudium et spes, n. 34).\\" The biblical concept that everyone is called to sanctity was already enunciated by Augustine of Hippo, Francis of Sales, and Alphonsus Liguori, but their emphasis was on prayer and liturgical devotions, basically monastic spirituality applied to lay people. \\"Escriv√° is more radical,\\" writes Cardinal Luciani (1977), who later became John Paul I. \\"For him, it is the material work itself which must be turned into prayer and sanctity,\\" thus providing a lay spirituality for lay people to attain holiness. Thus, Sebastiano Baggio, Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, states that Escriv√° is a \\"turning point in the history of Christian spirituality. \\"The \\"absolute novelty\\" of Opus Dei, says Cardinal Franz K√∂nig (1975), the perceived leader of the \\"progressivists\\" in Vatican II, lies in teaching that the two separated worlds of religious life and professional life \\"should in fact walk together.\\" On a deeper level, the \\"great originality\\" of Opus Dei's message, states Jos√© Saraiva Martins (2002), is based on the teaching that all of creation has been sanctified by the God-become-flesh: movies, boardrooms, gardens, sports can and should lead to God. In this Christian materialism, as Escriv√° calls it, Christians leading an integral life of prayer and mortification are called to \\"passionately love the world\\" and to overcome the \\"enemies of sanctity\\": greed, lust and egoism. Franz K√∂nig: The \\"absolute novelty\\" of Opus Dei lies in teaching that the two separated worlds of religious life and professional life \\"should in fact walk together.\\" In the work of spreading a message that to many seems new, Opus Dei faced challenges, misunderstandings and controversies, leading some Catholic leaders like Cardinal John Carmel Heenan to see Opus Dei as a sign of contradiction, a \\"sign that is spoken against\\" (Lk 2:34).This term is \\"a distinctive definition of Christ and of his Church,\\" states John Paul II in a book of the same title. Others who say Opus Dei is a sign of contradiction are: Piers Paul Read, Vittorio Messori, Richard Gordon , Manuel Mar√≠a Bru Alonso, Eulogio Lopez. In the 1940s, some Jesuits led by Fr. Angel Carrillo de Albornoz, who later left the Society of Jesus, denounced Opus Dei's teachings as \\"a new heresy.\\" It is not orthodox, they said, to teach that the laity can be holy without public vows and distinctive clothing. Also, these critics were concerned that Opus Dei would take away vocations from the religious orders. Based on reports from Spain, the Superior General of the Society of Jesus, Fr. Wlodimir Ledochowski (1866‚Äì1942), told the Vatican he considered Opus Dei \\"very dangerous for the Church in Spain.\\" He described it as having a \\"secretive character\\" and saw \\"signs in it of a covert inclination to dominate the world with a form of Christian Masonry.\\" This attack against Opus Dei from within well-regarded ecclesiastical circles (\\"the opposition by good people,\\" Escriv√° called it), which happened time and again in its history, is considered the root of present-day accusations coming from the most varied quarters. This is the conclusion of a number of writers, including John L. Allen, Jr., a Catholic American journalist, in his work Opus Dei: an Objective Look Behind the Myths and Reality of the Most Controversial Force in the Catholic Church (2005). Some time after the end of the Second Vatican Council, Opus Dei critics started stating that it has an ultraconservative and reactionary vision of the Roman Catholic faith. In contrast, Messori and Allen state that the Opus Dei prelature does not have any doctrine other than what the Catholic Church teaches. Catholic thinkers such as George Weigel say the use of conservative, a political category, on religious, moral, or intellectual matters is \\"implausible and distorting.\\"Crisis Magazine: George Weigel: Liberal Church? Conservative Church?, November 2001 These should be categorised, they say, as either faithful or heretical, good or evil, true or false.See also Benedetto Croce's comments in Messori 1997. The \\"handing on\\" (traditio) of \\"living faith,\\" writes Weigel, has the \\"capacity to inspire innovative thinking.\\" Opus Dei is the perfect storm, says Allen: It has become the center of the debate in the post-Vatican II polarization in Catholic politics. The late Hans Urs von Balthasar, considered one of the greatest theologians of the 20th century, discussed Opus Dei in an article entitled \\"Fundamentalism,\\" describing it as \\"a concentration of fundamentalist power in the Church.\\" (article in Wort und Wahrheit, 1963). He based his negative views on his reading of some points of Escriva's main book, The Way, which von Balthasar did not consider of sufficient spiritual depth for its worldwide goals. On the other hand, V. Messori, who studied the von Balthasar issue, says that the theologian later retracted his views after more in-depth study and after meeting members of Opus Dei. He even defended Opus Dei against attacks.

It quickly became popular and was issued in both Swedish and Danish editions. Ramus also wrote about the famous Maelstrom at Moskenstraumen. His work was read by Edgar Allan Poe and featured in his short story A Descent into the Maelstr√∂m (1841). Perhaps his best known book was Norges Beskrivelse which contains a poem about a feral child, Jostedalsrypa. She was the only survivor of the Black Death in the remote valley of Jostedal after of the Black Death (Svartedauden).

The idea was created by Jonathan King for Channel 4 as a way to introduce new presenters and was featured in his newspaper column of the time in The Sun to seek applicants. He then moved the project, before it began, to BBC Two which was broadcasting his Entertainment USA series. It was broadcast in an early-evening slot on Tuesdays at 6pm. The show's logo was a roadsign with a red ring and a black dash. The show was presented in its first series by Jeremy Legg and Lisa Maxwell, and for the remaining three series by Tony Baker and Jenny Powell. The presenters regularly took part in stunts such as jetbiking. In its final series, in addition to Baker and Powell, presenters were chosen from around the country to represent different regions. Terry Vaughan and Linda Huntley represented the Southeast region.  Overview  Each week the show was set in a different town or location, and, as well as pop videos, had its own specially made videos about that location and some things about which the place was famous. Each music track ran for 90 seconds so as to appeal to viewers who liked them without alienating those who didn't. It exposed and helped break many unknown songs. The theme tune was Sex Appeal by Jonathan King. The show included both UK and US chart countdowns. At its peak, the series was the top-rated show on BBC Two and had up to six million weekly viewers.

It is an example of a non-perturbative vacuum state, characterized by non-vanishing condensates such as the gluon condensate and the quark condensate in the complete theory which includes quarks. The presence of these condensates characterizes the confined phase of quark matter. Symmetries and symmetry breaking =Symmetries of the QCD Lagrangian= Like any relativistic quantum field theory, QCD enjoys Poincar√© symmetry including the discrete symmetries CPT (each of which is realized). Apart from these space-time symmetries, it also has internal symmetries. Since QCD is an SU(3) gauge theory, it has local SU(3) gauge symmetry. Since it has many flavours of quarks, it has approximate flavour and chiral symmetry. This approximation is said to involve the chiral limit of QCD. Of these chiral symmetries, the baryon number symmetry is exact. Some of the broken symmetries include the axial U(1) symmetry of the flavour group. This is broken by the chiral anomaly. The presence of instantons implied by this anomaly also breaks CP symmetry. In summary, the QCD Lagrangian has the following symmetries: *Poincar√© symmetry and CPT invariance *SU(3) local gauge symmetry *approximate global SU() √ó SU() flavour chiral symmetry and the U(1) baryon number symmetry The following classical symmetries are broken in the QCD Lagrangian: *scale, i.e., conformal symmetry (through the scale anomaly), giving rise to asymptotic freedom *the axial part of the U(1) flavour chiral symmetry (through the chiral anomaly), giving rise to the strong CP problem. =Spontaneous symmetry breaking= When the Hamiltonian of a system (or the Lagrangian) has a certain symmetry, but the vacuum does not, then one says that spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) has taken place. A familiar example of SSB is in ferromagnetic materials. Microscopically, the material consists of atoms with a non-vanishing spin, each of which acts like a tiny bar magnet, i.e., a magnetic dipole. The Hamiltonian of the material, describing the interaction of neighbouring dipoles, is invariant under rotations. At high temperature, there is no magnetization of a large sample of the material. Then one says that the symmetry of the Hamiltonian is realized by the system. However, at low temperature, there could be an overall magnetization. This magnetization has a preferred direction, since one can tell the north magnetic pole of the sample from the south magnetic pole. In this case, there is spontaneous symmetry breaking of the rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian. When a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken, massless bosons appear, corresponding to the remaining symmetry. This is called the Goldstone phenomenon and the bosons are called Goldstone bosons. =Symmetries of the QCD vacuum= The SU() √ó SU() chiral flavour symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian is broken in the vacuum state of the theory. The symmetry of the vacuum state is the diagonal SU() part of the chiral group. The diagnostic for this is the formation of a non-vanishing chiral condensate , where is the quark field operator, and the flavour index is summed. The Goldstone bosons of the symmetry breaking are the pseudoscalar mesons. When , i.e., only the up and down quarks are treated as massless, the three pions are the Goldstone bosons. When the strange quark is also treated as massless, i.e., , all eight pseudoscalar mesons of the quark model become Goldstone bosons. The actual masses of these mesons are obtained in chiral perturbation theory through an expansion in the (small) actual masses of the quarks. In other phases of quark matter the full chiral flavour symmetry may be recovered, or broken in completely different ways. Experimental evidence The evidence for QCD condensates comes from two eras, the pre-QCD era 1950‚Äì1973 and the post-QCD era, after 1974. The pre-QCD results established that the strong interactions vacuum contains a quark chiral condensate, while the post-QCD results established that the vacuum also contains a gluon condensate. = Motivating results =  Gradient coupling  In the 1950s, there were many attempts to produce a field theory to describe the interactions of pions and nucleons. The obvious renormalizable interaction between the two objects is the Yukawa coupling to a pseudoscalar: :L_I= \\\\bar{N}\\\\gamma_5 \\\\pi N And this is clearly theoretically correct, since it is leading order and it takes all the symmetries into account. But, in isolation, it doesn't match experiment. The interaction that does couples the nucleons to the gradient of the pion field. :g \\\\bar{N}\\\\gamma^\\\\mu\\\\gamma_5 \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\pi N This is the gradient-coupling model. This interaction has a very different dependence on the energy of the pion‚Äîit vanishes at zero momentum. This type of coupling means that a coherent state of low momentum pions barely interacts at all. This is a manifestation of an approximate symmetry, a shift symmetry of the pion field. The replacement :\\\\pi \\\\rightarrow \\\\pi+C leaves the gradient coupling alone, but not the pseudoscalar coupling. The œÉ-model (discussed below), however, arranges that this is also a symmetry of the above Yukawa coupling, in conjunction with the œÉ-field. The modern explanation for the shift symmetry is now understood to be the Nambu-Goldstone non-linear symmetry realization mode, due to Yoichiro Nambu Y. Nambu and G. Jona-Lasinio (1961), Dynamical Model of Elementary Particles Based on an Analogy with Superconductivity. I, Phys. Rev. 122, 345-358 and Jeffrey Goldstone. The pion field is a Goldstone boson, while the shift symmetry is a manifestation of a degenerate vacuum.  Goldberger‚ÄìTreiman relation  There is a mysterious relationship between the strong interaction coupling of the pions to the nucleons, the coefficient in the gradient coupling model, and the axial vector current coefficient of the nucleon which determines the weak decay rate of the neutron. The relation is :g_{\\\\pi NN} F_\\\\pi = G_A M_N and it is obeyed to 10% accuracy. The constant is the coefficient that determines the neutron decay rate. It gives the normalization of the weak interaction matrix elements for the nucleon. On the other hand, the pion-nucleon coupling is a phenomenological constant describing the scattering of bound states of quarks and gluons. The weak interactions are current-current interactions ultimately because they come from a non-Abelian gauge theory. The Goldberger‚ÄìTreiman relation suggests that the pions for some reason interact as if they are related to the same symmetry current.  Partially conserved axial current  The structure which gives rise to the Goldberger‚ÄìTreiman relation was called the partially conserved axial current (PCAC) hypothesis, spelled out in the pioneering œÉ-model paper.Gell-Mann, M., L√©vy, M., The axial vector current in beta decay, Nuovo Cim 16, 705‚Äì726 (1960). Partially conserved describes the modification of a spontaneously-broken symmetry current by an explicit breaking correction preventing its conservation. The axial current in question is also often called the chiral symmetry current. The basic idea of SSB is that the symmetry current which performs axial rotations on the fundamental fields does not preserve the vacuum: This means that the current applied to the vacuum produces particles. The particles must be spinless, otherwise the vacuum wouldn't be Lorentz invariant. By index matching, the matrix element must be :J_\\\\mu 0\\\\rangle = k_\\\\mu \\\\pi\\\\rangle \\\\,, where is the momentum carried by the created pion. When the divergence of the axial current operator is zero, we must have :\\\\partial_\\\\mu J^\\\\mu 0\\\\rangle = k^\\\\mu k_\\\\mu \\\\pi\\\\rangle = m_\\\\pi^2\\\\pi\\\\rangle = 0\\\\,. Hence these pions are massless, , in accordance with Goldstone's theorem. If the scattering matrix element is considered, we have :k_\\\\mu \\\\langle N(p) \\\\pi(k) N(p') \\\\rangle = \\\\langle N(p)  J_\\\\mu N(p')\\\\rangle \\\\,. Up to a momentum factor, which is the gradient in the coupling, it takes the same form as the axial current turning a neutron into a proton in the current-current form of the weak interaction. :\\\\langle N J^\\\\mu N\\\\rangle \\\\langle e J_\\\\mu  u\\\\rangle~. But if a small explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry (due to quark masses) is introduced, as in real life, the above divergence does not vanish, and the right hand side involves the mass of the pion, now a Pseudo-Goldstone boson.  Soft pion emission  Extensions of the PCAC ideas allowed Steven Weinberg to calculate the amplitudes for collisions which emit low energy pions from the amplitude for the same process with no pions. The amplitudes are those given by acting with symmetry currents on the external particles of the collision. These successes established the basic properties of the strong interaction vacuum well before QCD. =Pseudo- Goldstone bosons= Experimentally it is seen that the masses of the octet of pseudoscalar mesons is very much lighter than the next lightest states; i.e., the octet of vector mesons (such as the rho meson). The most convincing evidence for SSB of the chiral flavour symmetry of QCD is the appearance of these pseudo-Goldstone bosons. These would have been strictly massless in the chiral limit. There is convincing demonstration that the observed masses are compatible with chiral perturbation theory. The internal consistency of this argument is further checked by lattice QCD computations which allow one to vary the quark mass and check that the variation of the pseudoscalar masses with the quark mass is as required by chiral perturbation theory. =Eta prime meson= This pattern of SSB solves one of the earlier \\"mysteries\\" of the quark model, where all the pseudoscalar mesons should have been of nearly the same mass. Since , there should have been nine of these. However, one (the SU(3) singlet Œ∑‚Ä≤ meson) has quite a larger mass than the SU(3) octet. In the quark model, this has no natural explanation ‚Äì a mystery named the Œ∑‚àíŒ∑‚Ä≤ mass splitting (the Œ∑ is one member of the octet, which should have been degenerate in mass with the Œ∑‚Ä≤). In QCD, one realizes that the Œ∑‚Ä≤ is associated with the axial UA(1) which is explicitly broken through the chiral anomaly, and thus its mass is not \\"protected\\" to be small, like that of the Œ∑. The Œ∑‚ÄìŒ∑‚Ä≤ mass splitting can be explained through the 't Hooft instanton mechanism, whose realization is also known as Witten‚ÄìVeneziano mechanism. =Current algebra and QCD sum rules= PCAC and current algebra also provide evidence for this pattern of SSB. Direct estimates of the chiral condensate also come from such analysis. Another method of analysis of correlation functions in QCD is through an operator product expansion (OPE). This writes the vacuum expectation value of a non-local operator as a sum over VEVs of local operators, i.e., condensates. The value of the correlation function then dictates the values of the condensates. Analysis of many separate correlation functions gives consistent results for several condensates, including the gluon condensate, the quark condensate, and many mixed and higher order condensates. In particular one obtains :\\\\begin{align} \\\\left\\\\langle (gG)^2\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\left\\\\langle g^2 G_{\\\\mu u}G^{\\\\mu u}\\\\right\\\\rangle &\\\\approx 0.5 \\\\;\\\\text{GeV}^4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\overline\\\\psi\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle &\\\\approx (-0.23)^3 \\\\;\\\\text{GeV}^3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left\\\\langle (gG)^4\\\\right\\\\rangle&\\\\approx 5:10\\\\left\\\\langle (gG)^2\\\\right\\\\rangle^2 \\\\end{align} Here refers to the gluon field tensor, to the quark field, and to the QCD coupling. These analyses are being refined further through improved sum rule estimates and direct estimates in lattice QCD. They provide the raw data which must be explained by models of the QCD vacuum. Models of the QCD vacuum A full solution of QCD should give a full description of the vacuum, confinement and the hadron spectrum. Lattice QCD is making rapid progress towards providing the solution as a systematically improvable numerical computation. However, approximate models of the QCD vacuum remain useful in more restricted domains. The purpose of these models is to make quantitative sense of some set of condensates and hadron properties such as masses and form factors. This section is devoted to models. Opposed to these are systematically improvable computational procedures such as large QCD and lattice QCD, which are described in their own articles. =The Savvidy vacuum, instabilities and structure= The Savvidy vacuum is a model of the QCD vacuum which at a basic level is a statement that it cannot be the conventional Fock vacuum empty of particles and fields. In 1977, George Savvidy showed that the QCD vacuum with zero field strength is unstable, and decays into a state with a calculable non vanishing value of the field. Since condensates are scalar, it seems like a good first approximation that the vacuum contains some non-zero but homogeneous field which gives rise to these condensates. However, Stanley Mandelstam showed that a homogeneous vacuum field is also unstable. The instability of a homogeneous gluon field was argued by Niels Kj√¶r Nielsen and Poul Olesen in their 1978 paper. These arguments suggest that the scalar condensates are an effective long-distance description of the vacuum, and at short distances, below the QCD scale, the vacuum may have structure. =The dual superconducting model= In a type II superconductor, electric charges condense into Cooper pairs. As a result, magnetic flux is squeezed into tubes. In the dual superconductor picture of the QCD vacuum, chromomagnetic monopoles condense into dual Cooper pairs, causing chromoelectric flux to be squeezed into tubes. As a result, confinement and the string picture of hadrons follows. This dual superconductor picture is due to Gerard 't Hooft and Stanley Mandelstam. 't Hooft showed further that an Abelian projection of a non-Abelian gauge theory contains magnetic monopoles. While the vortices in a type II superconductor are neatly arranged into a hexagonal or occasionally square lattice, as is reviewed in Olesen's 1980 seminar one may expect a much more complicated and possibly dynamical structure in QCD. For example, nonabelian Abrikosov- Nielsen-Olesen vortices may vibrate wildly or be knotted. =String models= String models of confinement and hadrons have a long history. They were first invented to explain certain aspects of crossing symmetry in the scattering of two mesons. They were also found to be useful in the description of certain properties of the Regge trajectory of the hadrons. These early developments took on a life of their own called the dual resonance model (later renamed string theory). However, even after the development of QCD string models continued to play a role in the physics of strong interactions. These models are called non-fundamental strings or QCD strings, since they should be derived from QCD, as they are, in certain approximations such as the strong coupling limit of lattice QCD. The model states that the colour electric flux between a quark and an antiquark collapses into a string, rather than spreading out into a Coulomb field as the normal electric flux does. This string also obeys a different force law. It behaves as if the string had constant tension, so that separating out the ends (quarks) would give a potential energy increasing linearly with the separation. When the energy is higher than that of a meson, the string breaks and the two new ends become a quark-antiquark pair, thus describing the creation of a meson. Thus confinement is incorporated naturally into the model. In the form of the Lund model Monte Carlo program, this picture has had remarkable success in explaining experimental data collected in electron-electron and hadron-hadron collisions. =Bag models= Strictly, these models are not models of the QCD vacuum, but of physical single particle quantum states  the hadrons. The model proposed originally in 1974 by A. Chodos et al. consists of inserting a quark model in a perturbative vacuum inside a volume of space called a bag. Outside this bag is the real QCD vacuum, whose effect is taken into account through the difference between energy density of the true QCD vacuum and the perturbative vacuum (bag constant ) and boundary conditions imposed on the quark wave functions and the gluon field. The hadron spectrum is obtained by solving the Dirac equation for quarks and the Yang‚ÄìMills equations for gluons. The wave functions of the quarks satisfy the boundary conditions of a fermion in an infinitely deep potential well of scalar type with respect to the Lorentz group. The boundary conditions for the gluon field are those of the dual color superconductor. The role of such a superconductor is attributed to the physical vacuum of QCD. Bag models strictly prohibit the existence of open color (free quarks, free gluons, etc.) and lead in particular to string models of hadrons. The chiral bag modelLinas Vepstas, A.D. Jackson, \\"Justifying the Chiral Bag\\", Physics Reports Volume 187, Issue 3, March 1990, Pages 109-143.Atsushi Hosaka, Hiroshi Toki, \\"Chiral bag model for the nucleon\\", Physics Reports Volume 277, Issues 2‚Äì3, December 1996, Pages 65-188. couples the axial vector current of the quarks at the bag boundary to a pionic field outside of the bag. In the most common formulation, the chiral bag model basically replaces the interior of the skyrmion with the bag of quarks. Very curiously, most physical properties of the nucleon become mostly insensitive to the bag radius. Prototypically, the baryon number of the chiral bag remains an integer, independent of bag radius: the exterior baryon number is identified with the topological winding number density of the Skyrme soliton, while the interior baryon number consists of the valence quarks (totaling to one) plus the spectral asymmetry of the quark eigenstates in the bag. The spectral asymmetry is just the vacuum expectation value summed over all of the quark eigenstates in the bag. Other values, such as the total mass and the axial coupling constant , are not precisely invariant like the baryon number, but are mostly insensitive to the bag radius, as long as the bag radius is kept below the nucleon diameter. Because the quarks are treated as free quarks inside the bag, the radius-independence in a sense validates the idea of asymptotic freedom. =Instanton ensemble= Another view states that BPST- like instantons play an important role in the vacuum structure of QCD. These instantons were discovered in 1975 by Alexander Belavin, Alexander Markovich Polyakov, Albert S. Schwarz and Yu. S. Tyupkin as topologically stable solutions to the Yang-Mills field equations. They represent tunneling transitions from one vacuum state to another. These instantons are indeed found in lattice calculations. The first computations performed with instantons used the dilute gas approximation. The results obtained did not solve the infrared problem of QCD, making many physicists turn away from instanton physics. Later, though, an instanton liquid model was proposed, turning out to be more promising an approach. The dilute instanton gas model departs from the supposition that the QCD vacuum consists of a gas of BPST- like instantons. Although only the solutions with one or few instantons (or anti-instantons) are known exactly, a dilute gas of instantons and anti- instantons can be approximated by considering a superposition of one-instanton solutions at great distances from one another. Gerard 't Hooft calculated the effective action for such an ensemble, and he found an infrared divergence for big instantons, meaning that an infinite amount of infinitely big instantons would populate the vacuum. Later, an instanton liquid model was studied. This model starts from the assumption that an ensemble of instantons cannot be described by a mere sum of separate instantons. Various models have been proposed, introducing interactions between instantons or using variational methods (like the \\"valley approximation\\") endeavoring to approximate the exact multi-instanton solution as closely as possible. Many phenomenological successes have been reached. Whether an instanton liquid can explain confinement in 3+1 dimensional QCD is not known, but many physicists think that it is unlikely. =Center vortex picture= A more recent picture of the QCD vacuum is one in which center vortices play an important role. These vortices are topological defects carrying a center element as charge. These vortices are usually studied using lattice simulations, and it has been found that the behavior of the vortices is closely linked with the confinement‚Äìdeconfinement phase transition: in the confinement phase vortices percolate and fill the spacetime volume, in the deconfinement phase they are much suppressed. Also it has been shown that the string tension vanished upon removal of center vortices from the simulations, hinting at an important role for center vortices.

Content \\"At birth Post-normal science was conceived as an inclusive set of robust insights more than as an exclusive fully structured theory or field of practice\\".Funtowicz, S., 2016, personal correspondence. Some of the ideas underpinning PNS can already be found in a work published in 1983 and entitled \\"Three types of risk assessment: a methodological analysis\\" Funtowicz, S. O. and Ravetz, J. R. (1985), Three types of risk assessment: a methodological analysis, in C. Whipple and V. T. Covello (Eds), Risk Analysis in the Private Sector, pp 217-232 (Plenum, New York). This and subsequent works show that PNS concentrates on few aspects of the complex relation between science and policy: the communication of uncertainty, the assessment of quality, and the justification and practice of the extended peer communities. Coming to the PNS diagram (figure above) the horizontal axis represents ‚ÄòSystems Uncertainties‚Äô and the vertical one ‚ÄòDecision Stakes‚Äô. The three quadrants identify Applied Science, Professional Consultancy, and Post-Normal Science. Different standards of quality and styles of analysis are appropriate to different regions in the diagram, i.e. Post-normal science does not claim relevance and cogency on all of science's application but only on those defined by the PNS's mantram with a fourfold challenge: ‚Äòfacts uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent‚Äô. For applied research science's own peer quality control system will suffice (or so was assumed at the moment PNS was formulated in the early nineties), while professional consultancy was considered appropriate for these settings which cannot be ‚Äòpeer-reviewed‚Äô, and where the skills and the tacit knowledge of a practitioner are needed at the forefront, e.g. in a surgery room, or in a house on fire. Here a surgeon or a fireman takes a difficult technical decision based on her or his training and appreciation of the situation (the Greek concept of ‚ÄòMetis‚Äô). Complexity There are important linkages between PNS and complexity science,Rees, M., 2017, Black holes are simpler than forests and science has its limits, AEON, 1 December. e.g. system ecology (C. S. Holling) and hierarchy theory (Arthur Koestler). In PNS, complexity is respected through its recognition of a multiplicity of legitimate perspectives on any issue; and reflexivity is realised through the extension of accepted ‚Äòfacts‚Äô beyond the supposedly objective productions of traditional research. Also, the new participants in the process are not treated as passive learners at the feet of the experts, being coercively convinced through scientific demonstration. Rather, they will form an ‚Äòextended peer community‚Äô, sharing the work of quality assurance of the scientific inputs to the process, and arriving at a resolution of issues through debate and dialogue.Funtowicz, S., and Ravetz, J.R., THE POETRY OF THERMODYNAMICS, Energy, entropy/exergy and quality, Futures, Vol. 29, No. 9. pp. 791-810, 1997. The necessity to embrace complexity in a post normal perspective to understand and face zoonoses is argumented by David Waltner- Toews.Waltner-Toews D. 2017, Zoonoses, One Health and complexity: wicked problems and constructive conflict. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 372. Extended Peer Community PNS concept of extended peer community moves from and transcends the familiar concept of scientific peer community relative to a well-defined field of scientific research. The peer community is extended in two respects: first, more than one discipline is assumed to have a potential bearing on the issue being debated, thereby providing different lenses to consider the problem. Second the community is extended to lay actors, taken to be all those with stakes, or an interest, in the given issue. Perhaps the best justification of the concept is offered by Paul Feyerabend in Against Method.Feyerabend, P. (1975). Against method. Verso. For Feyerabend the participation of experts together with non-experts would allow the citizens to mature, inter alia by realizing that the experts are themselves lay-people outside their restricted field of competence. For Giandomenico Majone Majone, G. (1989). Evidence, argument, and persuasion in the policy process. Yale University Press. \\"In any area of public policy the choice of instruments, far from being a technical exercise that can be safely delegated to the experts, reflects as in a microcosm all the political, moral, and cultural dimensions of policy-making.\\" The same author notes: \\"Dialectical confrontation between generalists and experts often succeeds in bringing out unstated assumptions, conflicting interpretations of the facts, and the risks posed by the projects\\". These considerations justifies the need for an extended peer community, as the arena where the policy instruments and options can be discussed with - but without deference to - the experts and the authorities. The lay members of the community thus constituted may also take upon themselves active 'research' tasks; this has happened e.g. in the so-called 'popular epidemiology',Brown, P. (1997). Popular Epidemiology Revisited. Current Sociology, 45(3), 137‚Äì156. when the official authorities have shown reticence to perform investigations deemed necessary by the communities affected - for example - by a case of air or water pollution,Fjelland, R. (2016). When Laypeople are Right and Experts are Wrong: Lessons from Love Canal. International Journal for Philosophy of Chemistry, 22(1), 105‚Äì125. and more recently ‚Äòcitizen science‚Äô.Stilgoe, J. (2009). Citizen Scientists: Reconnecting Science with Civil Society. London: Demos. The extended community can usefully investigate the quality of the scientific assessments provided by the experts, the definition of the problem, as well as research priorities and research questions.Miedema, F. (12 May 2016). To confront 21st century challenges, science must rethink its reward system  Science  The Guardian. The Guardian. Thus, the extension of the peer community is not only ethically fair or politically correct, but also enhances the quality of the relevant science. An example is provided by Brian Wynne, who discusses the Cumbrian sheep farmers' interaction with scientist and authorities in the relation to the Chernobyl radioactive fallout.Wynne, B. (1992). Misunderstood misunderstanding: social identities and public uptake of science. Public Understanding of Science, 1, 281‚Äì304. The concept of extended peer community was developed in the context of politicised quality controversies in science (such as 'housewife' or 'popular' epidemiology Phil Brown, 1997, Popular Epidemiology Revisited, Current Sociology, Volume: 45 issue: 3, page(s): 137-156.), early evidence-based medicine (the Cochrane collaboration), and the total quality management ideas of W. Edwards Deming, in particular quality circles. Applications Beside its dominating influence in the literature on 'futures',Thomas Gauthier, Sylvaine Mercuri Chapuis, 2018, An Investigation of Futures Studies Scholarly Literature, In: Poli R. (eds) Handbook of Anticipation. Springer, Cham PNS is considered to have influenced the ecological ‚Äòconservation versus preservation debate‚Äô, especially via its reading by American pragmatist Bryan G. Norton. According to Jozef Keulartz Keulartz, J. (2018). Does Deliberation Promote Ecological Citizenship? The Convergence Hypothesis and the Reality of Polarization. In S. Sarkar & B. A. Minteer (Eds.), A Sustainable Philosophy‚ÄîThe Work of Bryan Norton, The International Library of Environmental, Agricultural and Food Ethics 26. Springer. the PNS concept of \\"extended peer community\\" influenced how Norton's developed his 'convergence hypothesis'. The hypothesis posits that ecologists of different orientation will converge once they start thinking 'as a mountain', or as a planet. For Norton this will be achieved via deliberative democracy, which will pragmatically overcome the black and white divide between conservationists and preservationists. More recently it has been argued that conservation science, embedded as it is in a multi-layered governance structures of policy-makers, practitioners, and stakeholders, is itself an 'extended peer community', and as a result conservation has always been ‚Äòpost-normal‚Äô.Rose, David Christian, 2018, Avoiding a Post-truth World: Embracing Post-normal Conservation, Conservation and Society, Vol. 16, Issue 4, p. 518-524. Other authors Heaslip, E., & Fahy, F. (2018). Developing transdisciplinary approaches to community energy transitions: An island case study. Energy Research & Social Science. attribute to PNS the role of having stimulated the take up of transdisciplinary methodological frameworks, reliant on the social constructivist perspective embedded in PNS. Today Post-normal science is intended as applicable to most instances where the use of evidence is contested due to different norms and values. Typical instances are in the use of evidence based policy Andrea Saltelli, Mario Giampietro, 2017, What is wrong with evidence based policy, and how can it be improved? Futures, 91, 62-71. and in evaluation.Schwandt, T. A. Post-normal evaluation? Evaluation 135638901985550 (2019). doi:10.1177/1356389019855501 As summarized in a recent work \\"the ideas and concepts of post normal science bring about the emergence of new problem solving strategies in which the role of science is appreciated in its full context of the complexity and the uncertainty of natural systems and the relevance of human commitments and values.\\"Lister, A.

Criticism A criticism of post-normal science is offered by Weingart (1997)Weingart, P. From \\"Finalization\\" to \\"Mode 2\\": old wine in new bottles?. Social Science Information 36 (4), 1997. Pp. 591-613. for whom Post-normal science does not introduce a new epistemology but retraces earlier debates linked to the so-called \\"finalization thesis\\". For J√∂rg Friedrichs J. Friedrichs, \\"Peak energy and climate change: The double bind of post-normal science,\\" Futures, vol. 43, pp. 469‚Äì477, 2011. ‚Äì comparing the issues of climate change and peak energy ‚Äì an extension of the peer community has taken place in the climate science community, transforming climate scientists into ‚Äòstealth advocates‚Äô,R. A. Pielke, Jr, The Honest Broker. Cambridge University Press, 2007. while scientists working on energy security ‚Äì without PNS, would still maintain their credentials of neutrality and objectivity. Another criticism is that the extended peer community's use undermines the scientific method's use of empiricism and that its goal would be better addressed by providing greater science education. The crisis of science It has been argued Andrea Saltelli, Silvio Funtowicz, 2017, What is science‚Äôs crisis really about? FUTURES, Volume 91, Pages 5-11. that PNS scholars have been prescient in anticipating the present crisis in science's quality control and reproducibility. A group of scholars of PNS orientation has published in 2016 a volume on the topic,Benessia, A., Funtowicz, S., Giampietro, M., Guimar√£es Pereira, A., Ravetz, J., Saltelli, A., Strand, R., van der Sluijs, J., 2016. The Rightful Place of Science: Science on the Verge. The Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes at Arizona State University. discussing inter alia what this community perceive as the root causes of the present science's crisis.Ravetz, J., 2016, How should we treat science's growing pains? The Guardian, 8 June 2016.Andrea Saltelli, 2018, Why science‚Äôs crisis should not become a political battling ground, FUTURES, vol. 104, p. 85-90. A World View piece published by Jerome R. Ravetz on the journal Nature in 2019 touches upon whether the way science is taught should be reconsidered. Quantitative approaches Among the quantitative styles of analysis which make reference to post-normal science one can mention NUSAP for numerical information, sensitivity auditing for indicators and mathematical modelling, Quantitative storytelling for exploring multiple frames in a quantitative analysis, and MUSIASEM in the field of social metabolism. A work where these approaches are suggested for sustainability is in Saltelli, A., Benini, L., Funtowicz, S., Giampietro, M., Kaiser, M., Reinert, E. S., & van der Sluijs, J. P. (2020). The technique is never neutral. How methodological choices condition the generation of narratives for sustainability. Environmental Science and Policy, Volume 106, April 2020, Pages 87-98.. Mathematical modelling In relation to mathematical modelling PNS suggests a participatory approach, whereby ‚Äòmodels to predict and control the future‚Äô are replaced by ‚Äòmodels to map our ignorance about the future‚Äô, in the process exploring and revealing the metaphors embedded in the model.Ravetz, J. R. Models as metaphors. in Public participation in sustainability science : a handbook (ed. B. Kasemir, J. J√§ger, C. Jaeger, Gardner Matthew T., Clark William C., and W. A.) (Cambridge University Press, 2003). PNS is also known for its definition of GIGO: in modelling GIGO occurs when the uncertainties in the inputs must be suppressed, lest the outputs become completely indeterminate.Funtowicz, S. O., and Ravetz, J. R. 1990, Post-normal science: A new science for new times, Scientific European, October 1990, p. 20-22. In a comment published in Nature 22 scholars take COVID-19 as the occasion for suggesting five ways to make models serve society better. The piece notes \\"how the operation of science changes when questions of urgency, stakes, values and uncertainty collide ‚Äî in the ‚Äòpost- normal‚Äô regime\\".A. Saltelli, G. Bammer, I. Bruno, E. Charters, M. Di Fiore, E. Didier, W. Nelson Espeland, J. Kay, S. Lo Piano, D. Mayo, R.J. Pielke, T. Portaluri, T.M. Porter, A. Puy, I. Rafols, J.R. Ravetz, E. Reinert, D. Sarewitz, P.B. Stark, A.

On March 25, i.e. in the midst of the crisis, a group of scholars of post-normal orientation published on the blog section of the STEPS_Centre (for Social, Technological and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability) at the University of Sussex. The piece Postnormal pandemics: Why COVID-19 requires a new approach to science, guest post on STEPS by David Waltner-Toews, Annibale Biggeri, Bruna De Marchi, Silvio Funtowicz, Mario Giampietro, Martin O‚ÄôConnor, Jerome R. Ravetz, Andrea Saltelli and Jeroen P. van der Sluijs. argues that the COVID-19 emergency has all the elements of a post normal science context, and notes that \\"This pandemic offers society an occasion to open a fresh discussion on whether we now need to learn how to do science in a different way\\".  Special issues  The journal FUTURES devoted several specials issues to PNS. * The first was in 1999 and included as editorial two pieces: from Jerome Ravetz and Silvio Funtowicz, Post-Normal Science‚Äîan insight now maturing, and from Jerome Ravetz: What is Post-Normal Science. * The second special issue, edited by Merryl Wyn Davies, was entitled \\"Post normal times\\" in 2011.Davies, M.W., Editor, 2011, Special Issue: Postnormal Times Futures, Volume 43, Issue 2, Pages 135-228 (March 2011). This was a selection of papers from the symposium \\"Post Normal Science ‚Äì perspectives & prospectives 26-27th June 2009, Oxford.\\" A summary of the abstracts can be found on the NUSAP net. * The third special issue on PNS was in 2017. This special issue contains a selection of papers discussed at the University of Bergen's Centre for the Study of the Sciences and the Humanities between 2014 and 2016. The issue includes also two extended commentaries on the present crisis in science and the post-fact/post-truth discourse, one from Europe (Saltelli and Funtowicz) and one from Japan (Tsukahara). All articles in this special issue are in open access. Another special issue on Post Normal Science was published on the journal Science, Technology & Human Values in May 2011.

Meza was born in Mexicali, Mexico. Short biography Mesa was born Jesus Fern√°ndez. Prior to beginning his career, and for undisclosed reasons, he changed his name officially to Juan Meza. Meza was a popular fighter among Latin Americans, specially those of Mexican descent who lived in North America. His trainer was the well known boxing personality, Jimmy Montoya. Professional career Juan Meza debuted on September 23, 1977, knocking out Elias Rodriguez in three rounds at Tucson. He lost for the first time on his second bout, being beaten on points after four rounds by Valentin Holguin on October 13 in Los Angeles. Six days later, he knocked out Davey White in Las Vegas. Eight days later, he had a rematch with Holguin, over the extremely rare five rounds schedule distance. He avenged his first loss by outpointing Holguin. On November 3, he scored his first knockout in the first round, defeating Horacio Pintado in Los Angeles. But, in his next fight, on November 18, he lost by a four-round decision to Carlos Ortiz, in San Diego. Meza began rising in boxing's ranks when he knocked Ortiz out in the first round on December 16, also at San Diego. He won 29 of his next 31 bouts, earning fame, particularly in the West Coast of the United States, as aforementioned. Among those thirty one bouts, there were many highlights, including: *His first presentation as a professional in Mexico, on February 12, 1978, when he knocked out Julio Gaxiola in his hometown of Mexicali. *A ten-round decision loss to William Berry on August 2, 1978. in Las Vegas. *A ten-round decision win against experienced James Martinez, who came into their fight sporting a record of 41 wins, 7 losses and one draw (tie), on January 9, 1979, in Phoenix. *A ten- round split decision loss to Carlos Mendoza, who also fought Roberto Dur√°n and Wilfredo G√≥mez; among others, on June 26, 1980 in Los Angeles. *A ninth-round knockout win over Javier Flores, who had 29 wins and 9 losses before their fight, on March 26, 1980, in Las Vegas. *A ten-round decision win in a rematch with James Martinez, on May 28, 1981 in Las Vegas. *A ten-round decision win over Carlos Mendoza, thus avenging his earlier defeat to Mendoza, on August 21, 1981, as part of the G√≥mez-Salvador S√°nchez fight's undercard in Las Vegas. *A knockout in nine rounds over Antonio Guido in Las Vegas as part of the Ben√≠tez-Dur√°n title fight's undercard, January 30, 1982, after which the WBC ranked him as the number one challenger to Wilfredo G√≥mez's WBC world Super-Bantamweight title. On March 27 of that year, Meza got his first world championship try, when he faced G√≥mez in Atlantic City, for the WBC world Super Bantamweight title. Meza lost to G√≥mez by a sixth-round knockout. After losing to G√≥mez, Mesa took off one year from boxing. During this time, G√≥mez left the championship vacant; to challenge for the WBC's world Featherweight championship, and Jaime Garza won it by knocking out Bobby Berna for the vacant championship. Meanwhile, Meza returned to boxing on April 26, 1983, knocking out Roberto Castillo in four rounds at Las Vegas. He traveled to Thailand during July of that year, to fight Pongpan Sorphayathai on the 13th. of that month. He beat the Thai fighter by a third-round knockout. On November 19, he fought Javier Barajas in Las Vegas, beating Barajas by a ten-round decision. The pair had a rematch, on May 16, 1984 in Las Vegas, and Meza won once again, by a ten-round decision. After that, he was ranked as the number one Super Bantamweight challenger once again by the WBC. On November 3, he was given a second try at the championship when he faced Garza, in Kingston, New York. Meza became the first challenger in boxing history to be dropped in round one, get up and knock the world champion out in the same first round, when he beat Garza to become the WBC world Super Bantamweight champion that day. On April 19, 1985 he and Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez co-starred in an undercard, defending their world championships against Mike Ayala and Ruben Castillo, respectively, at the Inglewood Forum, in Inglewood, California. Both champions retained their titles with sixth-round knockout wins. On August 18, he and Lupe Pintor squared off in a fight that garnered major interest among Mexican boxing fans. Meza lost his title in Tijuana that night, when Pintor dropped him twice, outpointing him over twelve rounds. Pintor lost his title, in turn, to Samart Payakaroon, who gave Meza a chance to recover the WBC world Super Bantamweight championship on December 10, 1986 in Bangkok. Despite not fighting for more than a year, Meza lasted until the twelfth round with Payakaroon, who proceeded to knock him out in that round. Meza had two fights in 1987, beating Lenny Valdez in the first round by knockout, and then losing to Javier Marquez by a knockout in round eight on October 30. After his fight with Marquez, he retired for ten years. On February 14, 1997, he returned to boxing with a knockout victory, beating Esteban Lozoya in four rounds at Mexicali. But, in his next fight, he met fringe contender Wilfredo Negron of Puerto Rico, being knocked out by the Puerto Rican in the first round at Miami. Meza then retired for the second time. He has stayed in retirement since. Because of his current age, it is doubtful he will ever box again as a professional. His professional boxing record consisted of 45 wins and 9 losses, with 37 wins by knockout.

The community of Red Rock sits on the shore of Lake Superior, about 16 km west of the Nipigon River where it drains into Nipigon Bay on the north shore of Lake Superior. The population as of 2011 is 942. During the Second World War, a prisoner of war camp was established here housing primarily German prisoners. Many men returned to work in the mill or surrounding woods after the war. The Red Rock Folk Festival, held by the Live From the Rock Folk & Blues Society, is held each year. Demographics Economy Red Rock Inn Red Rock's main source of employment was a kraft paper mill owned by Norampac. The mill originally consisted of two kraft paper machines but in late 2005 was reduced to running one machine. On August 31, 2006, Norampac announced the indefinite closure of the container board plant. This was due to unfavourable economic conditions such as the rising price of fibre, energy costs and the strengthening Canadian dollar. In September 2007 Norampac announced the sale of its Red Rock plant to American Logistic Services Inc. A new plywood mill was supposed to be operational by fall 2008, this deadline had been pushed back to spring 2009. The plans were ultimately cancelled however as the plant was torn down and the land was sold to Riversedge Developments in April 2015. There has been talk of constructing a sea port and biomass plant on the land, but it remains unclear whether this will be the case.

The Most Reverend Kevin C. Rhoades was appointed diocesan bishop by Pope Benedict XVI on November 14, 2009, and was installed on January 13, 2010. The Diocese of Fort Wayne‚ÄìSouth Bend encompasses 14 Indiana counties: Adams, Allen, DeKalb, Elkhart, Huntington, Kosciusko, LaGrange, Marshall, Noble, Steuben, St. Joseph, Wabash, Wells, and Whitley. The diocese has a co-cathedral setup with the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Fort Wayne as the primary cathedral and Saint Matthew's Cathedral in South Bend as the associate cathedral. History The diocese was erected as the Diocese of Fort Wayne (Dioecesis Wayne Castrensis) suffragan to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati on January 8, 1857, from territory earlier belonging to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Vincennes. In 1944 it became suffragan to the newly elevated Archdiocese of Indianapolis. In 1944 and 1956 it lost territory to the newly formed dioceses of Lafayette and Gary, respectively. In 1960 its name was changed to the Diocese of Fort Wayne‚ÄìSouth Bend.

Definition There are hypothetical values s of a complex variable, very near (in a quantifiable sense) to 1, such that :L(s,œá) = 0 for a Dirichlet character œá of modulus q say. =Immediate consequence= The possibility of a Siegel zero in analytic terms leads to an ineffective estimate :L(1,œá) > C(Œµ)q‚àíŒµ where C is a function of Œµ for which the proof provides no explicit lower bound (see effective results in number theory). History Important results on this type of zero of an L-function were obtained in the 1930s by Carl Ludwig Siegel, from whom they take their name (he was not the first to consider them, and they are sometimes called Landau‚ÄìSiegel zeroes to acknowledge also the work of Edmund Landau). (See pages 12‚Äì13.) Importance The importance of the possible Siegel zeroes is seen in all known results on the zero-free regions of L-functions: they show a kind of 'indentation' near s = 1, while otherwise generally resembling that for the Riemann zeta function ‚Äî that is, they are to the left of the line Re(s) = 1, and asymptotic to it. Because of the analytic class number formula, data on Siegel zeroes have a direct impact on the class number problem, of giving lower bounds for class numbers. This question goes back to C. F. Gauss. What Siegel showed was that such zeroes are of a particular type (namely, that they can occur only for œá a real character, which must be a Jacobi symbol); and, that for each modulus q there can be at most one such. This was by a 'twisting' argument, implicitly about the L-function of biquadratic fields. This in a sense isolated the Siegel zero as a special case of GRH (which would prove that it did not exist). In subsequent developments, however, detailed information on the Siegel zero has not shown it to be impossible. Work on the class number problem has instead been progressing by methods from Kurt Heegner's work, from transcendental number theory, and then Dorian Goldfeld's work combined with the Gross-Zagier theorem on Heegner points.

A concert band is usually under the direction of one or more conductors (band directors). A school band consists of woodwind instruments, brass instruments and percussion instruments, although upper level bands may also have string basses or bass guitar. School bands in the United Kingdom are generally similar to those in the US although pure brass bands are more commonplace in schools than in the US. Some countries usually prefer certain special types of bands, usually drums, over conventional ones. The school band movement in Japan is unusually strong, organized around an enormous competition system administered by the All-Japan Band Association. Many international observers of Japanese school bands consider them to be the most impressive in the world, particularly among very young students, and Japan is also home to one of the world's leading professional concert bands, the Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra. Middle school/Elementary school bands Junior High School Students band at Demachi Jr. High, Tonami City, Toyama, Japan Although some children learn an instrument prior to entering a middle school (or junior high), students in music education programs within the United States and Canada generally start daily band classes in the 6th or 7th Grade. Many band programs begin as early as 4th or 5th grade. The students usually make up a band based upon their grade, which may then be broken up into sectionals to provide better instrument-specific instruction. It is sometimes required for beginner students to play a recorder for a year before learning another instrument, so that basics, such as scales, embouchure, etc. can be taught easily. Other requirements may include learning a piano or guitar to understand basic music theory, notation, etc. A \\"beginning\\" band, consisting of the youngest students in the school, usually gives two or three concerts a year, and may participate in a local/state contest. These bands are given easy music to learn, often with many duplicate parts and simple rhythms. Students sometimes may be required to memorize the 12 major scales. Depending upon the size of the school, there may be one to three \\"higher level\\" bands after the beginning band. These bands are usually divided similarly to high school bands. Some schools require students to audition and be placed in a band according to their ability on their instrument. Others will assign students based on their performance as seen in class. Yet others will simply sort the students according to their age or grade level. Most of these decisions are decided by the conductor. These higher level bands will occasionally play in high school games and pep rallies to augment the local high school band, although in small schools they always come to these events. Beginning bands usually are used in the spot of an elective. Instruments typically in beginning bands: *Woodwind: Flutes, Oboes, Clarinets, Alto, Tenor, and occasionally Baritone saxophones, Bassoons *Brass: Tubas, Trombones, Trumpets, French Horns, Occasionally Baritones, or Euphoniums Some bands will also have a percussion kit, which will allow them to play bells and drums High school bands PAIGC High school band in Ziguinchor, Senegal, 1973 High school bands typically challenge students musically more than those in middle school. Music is much more difficult with more complex passages, intricate rhythms and more involved phrasing. Selections also vary in style. A well- rounded band is expected to be able to play a wide variety of music, ranging from serious 'program music' to lighter 'pop-style' music. For many high school students, school bands are the main form of music education available to them in school. Marches were the first major contributions to the wind band repertoire. There are many pieces other than marches written for wind band at present, but there are some historical standards that should be included into the repertoire of advanced ensembles. Some of the most notable of these pieces are Holst's First Suite in E-flat and Second Suite in F, and Grainger's Children's March and Lincolnshire Posy among others. Below is a list of the instrumentation in a typical concert band at the high school level. The number of instruments in each section varies, but listed below are usually the average number of members. Middle school/junior high bands are usually around the upper values for each instrument. Instrumentation in beginner bands is usually much larger than this. College and professional bands generally have smaller numbers of players. These numbers may vary widely, based on the instrument and the people playing them (as many people playing instruments such as trombones may drop out, causing others to change instruments to fill the need). Some bands have a set number of performers per section while other bands have open unlimited participation. Woodwind *1 or no Piccolo in C *8-10 Flutes *1-2 Oboes * 1 or no English Horn *1-2 Bassoons *1 or no E‚ô≠ Clarinet *8-24 B‚ô≠ Clarinets *1 or no E‚ô≠ Alto Clarinet *1-2 B‚ô≠ Bass Clarinets *1 or no EE‚ô≠ Contra-alto Clarinet *1 or no BB‚ô≠ Contrabass Clarinet *1 or no B‚ô≠ Soprano Saxophone *4-6 E‚ô≠ Alto Saxophones *2-3 B‚ô≠ Tenor Saxophones *1-2 E‚ô≠ Baritone Saxophone Brass *8-10 B‚ô≠ Trumpets *4-6 Horns in F *3-9 Trombones (sometimes including 1 Bass Trombone) *1-4 Baritone horns or Euphoniums *1-4 Tubas Strings *1 or no String Bass or Electric Bass Percussion * Percussionists playing: *Snare drum *Tom-toms *Bass drum *Cymbals including crash, ride, and suspended *Tambourine *2 playing Mallet Percussion, including orchestra bells, xylophone, marimba, chimes and vibraphone *1 Timpani *1 Drum kit *A variety of other auxiliary percussion instruments used on specific pieces, including Cabasa, Triangle, and Maracas. In most middle school bands, strings (besides the string bass) are not used. If they are, the band is generally considered an orchestra. The first high school band in the United States was the Boston Farm and Trade School Band, founded in 1856. The oldest high school band in America is The Christian Brothers Band (Memphis) founded in 1882.Bolton, Patrick (2009). The Christian Brothers Band, \\"The Oldest High School Band in America\\" 1872-1937. Christian Brothers Archives: Master's Thesis. College bands Many colleges/universities have band as a class. Some are integrated within a 'Music' course while others are not. They tend to be larger than a high school band and play at a higher level. Other school bands There are many other school band opportunities for students. Most of these fall under the jurisdiction of the director that teaches the daily band classes, whether or not the smaller groups meet daily or during school hours. Goin' Band from Raiderland, a college marching band in the United States =Marching band= Many schools, especially high schools in the United States, have a marching band. A school marching band may contain from 11 to over 500 students. Marching bands often practice frequently during the late summer and early fall and most often attend their school's football games, playing music in the stands, and marching a show during halftime. A show is usually between 6 and 10 minutes long, but many competitions place restrictions on length. Bands often compete in marching band competitions throughout the marching season (typically the same time as football season). Competitions vary in intensity. Some areas have many smaller, local competitions hosted by individual schools. Others host a regional competition. Others, such as Bands of America competitions are nationally known and take place in professional arenas. In addition to their show, marching bands often march parades. Often this is limited to their city or town's municipal parades, but some bands travel to participate in well known parades, such as the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade or the Tournament of Roses Parade on New Years Day. =Jazz band= Many schools have jazz programs in addition to their concert program. Different schools have different time slots for their jazz band. Some meet as an actual class during the school day. Others choose to practice after school or before school two or three times a week. Meeting as a class during school can often cause schedule conflicts with students' academic classes. Many times jazz band may rehearse during the study hall, free period, or part of the lunch period. Typical instrumentation for jazz ensembles will include trumpets, trombones, alto, tenor and baritone saxophones, a drum set (often called a \\"trap set\\"), guitar, bass guitar, piano, clarinet and often, a vibraphone or marimba. Many areas have jazz festivals, but the popularity of these widely vary from different regions of the country. Jazz bands are most often used as an ambassador ensemble for the band program as a whole. In addition, jazz education is seen as growing in popularity as a specialty area within school music departments. =Chamber ensembles= Schools rarely have chamber music ensembles that meet as real classes, usually depending on the region, state and budget. Most of these groups are ad hoc ensembles put together by the director or the students themselves for a contest or recital. Examples would be clarinet quartets, woodwind quintet, brass quintet, duets, and trios. Groups consisting of the entire woodwind or brass section, or even percussion section of a band are also sometimes formed. =All-region bands= Perhaps not associated with the individual school, All-Region bands are audition-only groups for the most advanced players in each school. There are many different \\"All-Region\\" bands, ranging from the most local \\"All-County\\" or \\"All- District\\"(when referring to school districts) to the more prestigious \\"All- State\\". Many states also have a level between County and State bands which varies in name according to the area. These events are often highly enjoyed by the students that attend them. Musical literature is often increased in difficulty for the concerts, providing a challenge that isn't seen at schools. Students also get to meet new players on their instrument and share stories from their own band experiences. Region bands typically last over a weekend, though some may meet for over a week before performing a concert. Though not associated with All-State, Florida has a statewide band festival called Festival of Winds, held in Tampa at The University of South Florida in the first weekend of December. Also, Florida, Alabama, and Georgia have a band festival called Tri-State, held in Tallahassee, Florida at Florida State University in the same time period as Festival of Winds. =Modern band= Modern band Modern Band: The Next Step in the Evolution of Music from School Band and Orchestra (March, 2013). is an instrumental and vocal school music program taught in a growing number of public schools systems in the U.S. Instrumentation typically includes acoustic guitar, electric guitar, electric bass, keyboard, vocals, computers and percussion instruments. The repertoire of modern band is evolving as it draws from commercially dominant and contemporary music styles of the day such as pop, rock, disco, reggae, hip-hop and more. Major public school systems that offer Modern Band programming include those in the New York City Department of Education, Los Angeles Unified School District, Chicago Public Schools and others. Modern band is a new movement in public school music education circles. The term \\"Modern Band\\" was coined by a music education non-profit, Little Kids Rock, who partners with school districts from economically challenged communities to expand their music programs. Stereotypes and popular culture ='Band geek'= \\"Band geek\\" or \\"band nerd\\" is a high school stereotype of a person obsessed with playing band music. However, the term usually relates to the belief that most people who are in school bands are socially inept.Patnaik, G. and Shinseki, M.

Simon and Schuster. p 37. The term is sometimes used to describe any student who plays an instrument and is in a band class (including students in the orchestra).Youngs, J.L. (2004) Taste Berries for Teens #4: Inspirational Short Stories and Encouragement. HCI Teens Publishing. p 7.Willman, C. (2005) Rednecks & Bluenecks: The Politics of Country Music. p 135. \\"Orch dork\\" is a variation specifically for members of school orchestras.Trope, Z. (2003) Please Don't Kill the Freshman: A Memoir. HarperCollins. p 44. These terms have become a label of pride for many band members, being found on T-shirts, bumper stickers, etc. =Gender stereotypes in instrument selection= In school bands, more females than males tend to play most woodwind instruments, especially flute, and more males than females tend to play brass instruments, saxophone, and percussion. However, this is not always the case. These stereotypes can be avoided when band directors assess each student for musical capacity, as well as, meet with students individually to analyze their physical characteristics. For example, petite students would be more successful playing the clarinet over the tuba. Additionally, the role of gender bias in musical instrument assignment is highly debated in the field of music education. Some feel that it should be left alone while others want to combat it. One way band directors can overcome these stereotypes is to have live demonstrations from musicians playing gender atypical instruments (i.e., males playing flute, females playing tuba).Dale, E. B.

They are depicted as being Mojo-manufactured child clones of the X-Men. They first appeared in Uncanny X-Men Annual #12 and were created by Chris Claremont and Art Adams. Appearances In Uncanny X-Men Annual #10 (also by Chris Claremont and Art Adams), Mojo had de-aged the X-Men into children; this is what most likely inspired the creation of the X-Babies. In Uncanny X-Men Annual #12, the X-Men are assumed to be dead (having died in Dallas, only to be resurrected by the goddess Roma). Mojo, missing his greatest rating generators, had his people try to recreate his own version of the X-Men. After many unsuccessful attempts, the X-Babies were created. They soon rebel against Mojo. Mojo was about to kill them when he was told that their instant ratings were the highest ever recorded. There have been several incarnations of the X-Babies over the years, usually resembling whatever the current team of X-Men is. There has also been a similar team instead based on the Avengers, called the Mitey 'Vengers, who appeared in the X-Babies Reborn one-shot. There have also been several X-Babies villain teams including the \\"Brotherhood of Bullies\\" based on the Brotherhood of Mutants (X-Babies Murderama, 1998). In Excalibur: Mojo Mayhem (1989), Kitty Pryde, interrupted on a train trip, helps a team of X-Babies flee from a Mojo enforcer who is intent on getting them back by tricking them into signing contracts. In this incarnation, the children's childlike faults and crushes on each other are cruelly exploited by their adversary. Kitty, with backup, ends up saving the day. Several incarnations of the X-Babies are friendly with Ricochet Rita, the good past-self of the villain Spiral. Due to Spiral's time travel abilities, Rita, the babies and Spiral can all exist at the same period simultaneously. In X-Men #46-47 (1995), an X-Babies team is on the run from Mojo's hunters. Gambit and Bishop try to keep them alive. In Exiles #8, it is shown that the reality-hopping Exiles encountered a version of the X-Babies. It is not stated whether these X-Babies are the creation of Mojo or the X-Men of the reality in question. In fact, no further details are given except for the narrative commentary \\"The less said about this, the better.\\" The X-Baby Wolvie would then become a permanent member. Dazzler would encounter juvenile versions of the four main villains from the Age of Apocalypse timelines. These entities would cause major death and destruction throughout Mojoworld. The X-Men were once again reduced to infancy by Mojo during Uncanny X-Men #461 (2005). As kids, they were able to defeat the villains, parody lawyer-versions of the Exiles. and restore their rightful ages. Juggernaut had second thoughts about returning to adulthood but was convinced to go through with it. In the X-Babies four issue limited series (2009/2010) the X-Babies discover their position as Mojo's number one rating grabber had been usurped by the newer, cuter, but more shallow in personality 'Adorable X-Babies.' As a tie-in to the Avengers Vs. X-Men event, a spoof comic called A-Babies Vs. X-Babies #1 (2012) has been released. Influences In line with Mojo being a parody of network executives, the X-Babies parody the modern trend of creating younger and junior versions of cartoon characters which began in the 1980s with Jim Henson's Muppet Babies. In comics, Superbaby and Wonder Tot had appeared in Superboy and Wonder Woman comics from the 1950s and 1960s respectively.

Research ROV in the lagoon for testing before Antarctic missions Scientific investigations aboard the ATOLL concentrated on one of the most important food chain transitions: the linkages between the early life stages of herring (Clupea harengus) and their principal prey, the copepods. A major hypotheses of fisheries ecologists is that the microdistribution of prey, the microturbulence of the ocean, or the retention conditions are normally not suited to allow strong year classes of fish to develop. In most years more than 99% of herring larvae do not survive. Occasionally however, physical and biotic conditions are favorable, larval survival is high, and large year- classes result. Research work at the ATOLL investigated the effects of small- scale dynamics on fish feeding and predator avoidance and their correlation to year-class strength.

The area of the sector can be obtained by multiplying the circle's area by the ratio of the angle Œ∏ (expressed in radians) and 2 (because the area of the sector is directly proportional to its angle, and 2 is the angle for the whole circle, in radians): :A = \\\\pi r^2\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2 \\\\pi} = \\\\frac{r^2 \\\\theta}{2} The area of a sector in terms of L can be obtained by multiplying the total area r by the ratio of L to the total perimeter 2r. :A = \\\\pi r^2\\\\, \\\\frac{L}{2\\\\pi r} = \\\\frac{rL}{2} Another approach is to consider this area as the result of the following integral: :A = \\\\int_0^\\\\theta\\\\int_0^r dS = \\\\int_0^\\\\theta\\\\int_0^r \\\\tilde{r}\\\\, d\\\\tilde{r}\\\\, d\\\\tilde{\\\\theta} = \\\\int_0^\\\\theta \\\\frac12 r^2\\\\, d\\\\tilde{\\\\theta} = \\\\frac{r^2 \\\\theta}{2} Converting the central angle into degrees gives :A = \\\\pi r^2 \\\\frac{\\\\theta^\\\\circ}{360^\\\\circ}  Perimeter  The length of the perimeter of a sector is the sum of the arc length and the two radii: :P = L + 2r = \\\\theta r + 2r = r (\\\\theta + 2) where Œ∏ is in radians. Arc length The formula for the length of an arc is:Larson, R., & Edwards, B. H., Calculus I with Precalculus (Boston: Brooks/Cole, 2002), p. 570. : L = r \\\\theta where L represents the arc length, r represents the radius of the circle and Œ∏ represents the angle in radians made by the arc at the centre of the circle.Wicks, A., Mathematics Standard Level for the International Baccalaureate (West Conshohocken, PA: Infinity, 2005), p. 79. If the value of angle is given in degrees, then we can also use the following formula by: :L = 2 \\\\pi r \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{360}  Chord length  The length of a chord formed with the extremal points of the arc is given by :C = 2R\\\\sin\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} where C represents the chord length, R represents the radius of the circle, and Œ∏ represents the angular width of the sector in radians.

It was freeware prior to January 2007, but is now donationware for non- commercial and personal use, and shareware for other uses. Versions There are two versions of Mercury with similar functionality. The original version, no longer under development, is a set of NetWare Loadable Modules (NLMs) which runs on all versions of the Novell NetWare network operating system (NOS) from 3.x to 6.x (current ). It worked in conjunction with MS-DOS workstations running Pegasus Mail. Mercury/32 is a Win32 application running on all versions of Microsoft Windows from Windows 98 and Windows NT4 to the latest () Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 (Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 are recommended). Either version can act as a mail server for a LAN; both have additional support for some NetWare LAN features. Mercury is a fully independent mail server and can provide email services to all standards- compliant email clients, such as Eudora or Microsoft Outlook. Both versions of Mercury are highly modular, allowing support for different sets of Internet protocols to be installed as required. Mercury can also be installed tightly integrated with Pegasus Mail. The combination of Pegasus/Mercury is similar to the mail aspects of Microsoft Outlook/Microsoft Exchange Server. Mercury was originally developed to handle mail, both internal and external, on Netware servers in either bindery or NDS mode; Mercury ran on the system server, and integrated with Pegasus mail running on MS-DOS or Windows workstations.Internet mail: Another Internet gateway for Pegasus Mail  Mercury. Mercury is an Internet/Novell mail gateway program that is designed to work in conjunction with Pegasus Mail ... Features Mercury is extremely standards-compliant, supporting all major Internet mail-related protocols including SMTP (for both sending and receiving mail), POP3 and IMAP. The Win32 version also supports a dialup connection. Both versions have many features, with especially powerful support for managed mailing lists. Mercury is intended to be largely unobtrusive and needs little ongoing maintenance. The installation process is a simple task, taking less than a minute. At this point, the user must indicate the domain parameter to be used. The user list is manually administered. There is no limit in numbers of users declared. A single directory holds users storage locations, so to do a backup just copy the \\"mail\\" directory and it will copy all users' data. Also, a standard anti- virus could be used. After a mail is received, two files are created. When these files are finally written to disk, a simple antivirus engine could scan it. There is CLAMAV antivirus engine supplied, to be used as desired. The software has an enormous variety of configurations. Using proper care, the server could be very secure. The relay control is very effective, and the ability to filter mails based in many rules, making it very efficient. Could use blacklist/whitelist technology. There are included tools to reduce spam effects. =Protocols supported= * SMTP (server, relay-based client and full end-to-end delivery client) * POP3 (server and distributing client) * IMAP4rev1 (with multiple simultaneous access to the same mailbox) * PH (server, for directory lookups) * Finger (server, for directory lookups) * PopPass (server, for remote password changing) * HTTP (server, for web-based mailing list management) * SSL (Secure sockets layer) on SMTP, POP3 and IMAP servers * Mercury/32 4.73 can run as a MS Windows service =Extensions= Mercury/32, while not open source software, can be extended by anyone as the development documentation is free and publicly available at the pmail community. Below are some well known extensions, some bundled with Mercury/32. * GrayWall, a graylisting interface from Lukas Gebauer * SpamHalter, Bayesian spam filtering from Lukas Gebauer * ClamWall virus filter interface from Lukas Gebauer * Web Tools for Mercury/32 which enable web administration; by Rolf Lindby  Development status  Development on the version for Netware had basically stopped after the release of version 1.48 on 26 May 2000, and replacement by the Windows version was recommended. (A security patch, bringing the Mercury NLM version to 1.49, was released in August 2007.) On 19 June 2009 David Harris announced on the Pegasus Mail site that all development of Pegasus Mail and the associated Mercury program could only continue if sufficient users would commit to donating US$50 annually; on 21 July 2009 he said that there had been a good start. New versions of both programs have been released since. Developer David Harris said in April 2017 that both Pegasus Mail and the Mercury transport system were under active and major further development. In July 2019 he announced that the \\"Mercury v5 is very near to going into beta\\". On 25 December 2019 he said that, while there has been a delay due to health issues, he \\"can only promise you that there is progress, and that [he is] totally committed to getting these new versions released\\" and he is working, among others, on support for OAuth2 and OpenSSL v 1.1.1 and he expects \\"to have builds of Mercury v5 available to testers and interested users in the first three months of the New Year\\". XAMPP The XAMPP is an initiative by Apache Friends to develop a cross-platform web server solution pack with the main core components of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB or MySQL database and the PHP and perl interpreters, intended to be a cross platform equivalent of the LAMP stack used on Linux. While mail systems are natively distributed with the Linux operating system this was not the case for the Microsoft Windows platform and Apache Friends selected Mercury MTS for this component. There are no specific documents provided by Apache Friends for installation or configuration of XAMPP or its components with the concept of providing information via FAQs and forums, however some third party descriptions of the configuration and use of the Mercury MTS component are available.

The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri is a long allegorical poem in three parts (or canticas): the Inferno (Hell), Purgatorio (Purgatory), and Paradiso (Paradise), and 100 cantos, with the Inferno having 34, Purgatorio having 33, and Paradiso having 33 cantos. Set at Easter 1300, the poem describes the living poet's journey through hell, purgatory, and paradise. Throughout the poem, Dante refers to people and events from Classical and Biblical history and mythology, the history of Christianity, and the Europe of the Medieval period up to and including his own day. A knowledge of at least the most important of these references can aid in understanding the poem fully. For ease of reference, the cantica names are abbreviated to Inf., Purg., and Par. Roman numerals are used to identify cantos and Arabic numerals to identify lines. This means that Inf. X, 123 refers to line 123 in Canto X (or 10) of the Inferno and Par. XXV, 27 refers to line 27 in Canto XXV (or 25) of the Paradiso. The line numbers refer to the original Italian text. Boldface links indicate that the word or phrase has an entry in the list.

He serves as Dante's guide through the Inferno and Purgatorio. In the absence of texts of Homer, the readers in the Middle Ages considered Virgil's Aeneid to be the great epic poem of the Classical world. In Dante's time, many believed that Virgil had predicted the arrival of Christianity in lines from his Eclogue IV: \\"at the boy's birth in whom/the iron shall cease, the golden race arise\\" (trans John Dryden). This made him doubly suited to his role as guide. He also symbolises Reason. Virgil accompanies Dante from Inf. I, 61 to Purg. XXX, 54.  Sudden appearance. Inf.

In her city, Lucca, she was already, in life, an object of popular devotion and reputed a saint. In Dante's time, her fame had already made her a sort of patron saint of her city. The Elders of Saint Zita were ten citizens of Lucca who, along with the chief magistrate, were the rulers of the city.  An \\"elder of Saint Zita\\" (perhaps Bottario) is plunged into a lake of boiling pitch with the barrators. Inf. XXI, 35‚Äì54.

Along with traits such as averageness and youthfulness it influences judgments of aesthetic traits of physical attractiveness and beauty. For instance, in mate selection, people have been shown to have a preference for symmetry.Jones, B. C., Little, A. C., Tiddeman, B. P., Burt, D. M., & Perrett, D. I. (2001). Facial symmetry and judgements of apparent health Support for a ‚Äú‚Äò good genes ‚Äô‚Äù explanation of the attractiveness ‚Äì symmetry relationship, 22, 417‚Äì429. Facial symmetry has been suggested as a possible physical manifestation of the 'big-five' personality traits. Facial bilateral symmetry is typically defined as fluctuating asymmetry of the face comparing random differences in facial features of the two sides of the face. The human face also has systematic, directional asymmetry: on average, the face (mouth, nose and eyes) sits systematically to the left with respect to the axis through the ears, the so- called aurofacial asymmetry. Directional asymmetry Directional asymmetry is a systematic asymmetry of some parts of the face across the population. A theory of directional asymmetries in the human body is the axial twist hypothesis. As predicted by this theory, the eyes, nose and mouth are, on average, located slightly to the left of the axis through the ears. This aurofacial asymmetry is very small in young adults (0.5 degree), but much larger in small children (4 degrees). Fluctuating asymmetry Fluctuating asymmetry is the non-systematic variation of individual facial landmarks with respect to the facial midline, i.e., the line perpendicular to the line through the eyes, which crosses the tip of the nose and the chin. A wide variety of methods have been used to examine the claim that facial symmetry plays a role in judgments of beauty. Blending of multiple faces to create a composite and face-half mirroringKowner, R. (1996). \\"Facial asymmetry and attractiveness judgment in developmental perspective.\\" Journal of Experimental Psychology. Human perception and performance, 22(3), 662‚Äì75. have been among the techniques used. Alex Dodge 2012 left.jpg2 right sides Alex Dodge 2012.jpgOriginal Alex Dodge 2012 right.jpg2 left sides Conclusions derived from face mirroring, however, have been called into question, because it has been shown that mirroring face-halves creates artificial features. For example, if the nose of an individual is slightly bent to the right side, then mirroring the right side of the face will lead to an over-sized nose, while mirroring the left side will lead to an unnaturally small nose. =Attractiveness= Facial symmetry has been found to increase ratings of attractiveness in human faces. More symmetrical faces are perceived as more attractive in both males and females, although facial symmetry plays a larger role in judgments of attractiveness concerning female faces. While studies employing the composite faces produced results that indicate that more symmetrical faces are perceived as more attractive, studies applying the face- half mirroring technique have indicated that humans prefer slight asymmetry. Also, studies have shown that nearly symmetrical faces are considered highly attractive as compared to asymmetrical ones. The symmetry of the nose seems to be more important than that of the lips. =Dynamic asymmetries= Highly conspicuous directional asymmetries can be temporary ones. For example, during speech, most people (76%) tend to express greater amplitude of movement on the right side of their mouth. This is most likely caused by the uneven strengths of contralateral neural connections between the left hemisphere of the brain (linguistic localization) and the right side of the face. Also, lying distorts the symmetric balance of the facial musculature. =Facial averageness vs. symmetry= Experiments suggest that symmetry and averageness make independent contributions to attractiveness.Byatt, G., Rhodes, G., Sumich, A. Psychological Science (1999), 10(1), 52-58http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/com/108/3/233/ Grammer, K., & Thornhill, R. (1994). Human (homo sapiens) facial attractiveness and sexual selection: the role of symmetry and averageness. Journal of comparative psychology, 108(3), 233. =Aging= Facial symmetry is also a valid marker of cognitive aging. Progressive changes occurring throughout life in the soft tissues of the face will cause more prominent facial asymmetry in older faces. Therefore, symmetrical transformation of older faces generally increases their attractiveness while symmetrical transformation in young adults and children will decrease their attractiveness. Males with more symmetric faces in old age have higher intelligence and are more efficient at information processing than males with less symmetric faces. Personality and Big Five personality traits Research indicates that facial symmetry is correlated with the 'big- five' model of personality. The five factors are: * Openness to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious) * Conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless) * Extraversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved) * Agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached) * Neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident) A consistent finding is that facial symmetry is positively correlated with extraversion, indicating that individuals with more symmetric faces are also more extroverted. More symmetrical faces are also judged to be lower on neuroticism but higher on conscientiousness and agreeableness. More symmetrical faces are also more likely to have more desirable social attributes assigned to them, such as sociable, intelligent or lively. However, the relationship of facial symmetry and the 'big-five' personality model remains somewhat unclear with regard to neuroticism, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness. Openness and agreeableness appear to be significantly negatively related to facial symmetry, while neuroticism and conscientiousness do not seem to be linked to facial symmetry. With respect to trustworthiness it has been found that the facial muscles become imbalanced when lying. Evolution and sexual selection Sexual selection is a theoretical construct within evolution theory. According to sexual selection, mate choice can have profound influence on the preferred features. Sexual selection can only influence features that potential mates can perceive, such as smell, audition (e.g. song) and vision. Such features might be reliable indicators of hidden fitness parameters such as a good immune system or developmental stability. It has been argued that more symmetric faces are preferred because symmetry might be a reliable sign of such hidden fitness parameters. However it is possible that high facial symmetry in an individual is not due to their superior genetics but due to a lack of exposure to stressors during development. It has been found that more symmetrical faces are rated as healthier than less symmetrical faces. Indeed, facial symmetry was found to be positively associated with the perceived healthiness of the facial skin. Also, facial asymmetry was found to be correlated with physiological, psychological and emotional distress. Some evidence suggests that face preferences in adults might be correlated to infections in childhood.

It is located immediately to the north of the municipalities of Tampico and Ciudad Madero, at the southern tip of the state of Tamaulipas, on the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, it borders the municipalities of Gonz√°lez on the west and Aldama on the north, as well as P√°nuco in the state of Veracruz on the southeast. Altamira can also refer to the city, founded in 1749, that is its municipal seat and second-largest community. The municipality is primarily made up of the cities of Miramar and Altamira, in addition to many smaller outlying towns such as Cuauht√©moc. The municipality has a total area of 1,666.53 km¬≤ (643.45 sq mi). According to the INEGI 2010 census, the municipality has a population of 212,001 people. The city of Miramar had a population of 118,614 and the city of Altamira had a population of 59,536. The municipality is the industrial and port center for the region; although the Tampico docks on the P√°nuco River are used for loose cargo, the Port of Altamira handles all the containerised cargos. Altamira's advantage is having a sea Port with a great territorial reserve of approximately 9500 hectares. Altamira has land and rail connections to connect all companies with the main consumer markets and production hubs in Mexico, highlighting the northeastern zone, which includes the states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le√≥n and Coahuila. Because of its privileged geographical location, the Port of Altamira is easily accessible to the world's main shipping lines, enabling it to reach any market in every continent. The Port of Altamira was conceived under the Industrial Port Model; this means an industrial Park with its own Port. This situation results in multiple advantages for investors, since there is enough space and capacity to develop all kinds of industries which will have a nearby sea port available. Businesses can make their logistic processes more efficient, resulting in economic benefits. A large industrial sector, mainly involved in petro-chemicals, provides much employment and tax revenue; it includes foreign companies such as Chemours, SABIC, BASF, POSCO, etc. The state is trying to encourage construction of a new oil refinery for further integration. In 2014 President Pena announced that Mexico was ending its monopoly and opening oil and gas exploration to private companies; he hopes to stimulate both large and small-scale projects.

Released only months before Hughes's death, the collection won multiple prestigious literary awards. This collection of eighty-eight poems is widely considered to be Hughes's most explicit response to the suicide of his estranged wife Sylvia Plath in 1963, and to their widely discussed, politicized and \\"explosive\\" marriage.  Background  Until the publication of this book, 35 years after Plath's suicide, Hughes had said and published nearly nothing about his relationship and life with Plath. When it was discovered that he had infidelities while with Plath and had destroyed some of Plath's works after her death, some critics depicted him as a monster and Plath as a victim.Kakutani, Michiko. \\" 'Birthday Letters': A Portrait of Plath in Poetry for Its Own Sake.\\" 1998. In one instance, Hughes's name was chipped off Plath's tombstone in Yorkshire. The \\"Ted Hughes controversy\\" concerned his possible role in Plath's suicide and subsequent attempts at controlling the finished products of her poetry. The speculation resulted in extra-literary attention on Plath and Hughes and, consequently, their works as poets.Parini, Jay. \\"Bitter fame.\\" 1998 Poems including The Blue Flannel Suit directly address their relationship, and many are directly addressed to Plath herself.  Reception  After her death in 1963, Plath's wish to leave behind a meaningful legacy was fulfilled when her Ariel collection of poetry, and her semi-autobiographical novel The Bell Jar, were hailed as masterpieces of modern feminism, causing her to become a feminist icon in the 1970s. Hughes's apparent wish for redemption is realized in this autobiographical collection of poetry. The literary response to the publication of this collection was one of sensation. It was unknown at the time that Hughes was suffering from a terminal disease that may have prompted this unexpected release. Hughes's Birthday Letters topped the best-seller lists immediately. This was arguably due to public fascination with a persistent mystery surrounding the lives of the two icons. Within a short period of time the collection was awarded the Forward Poetry Prize, the T. S. Eliot Prize for Poetry and the Whitbread Poetry and Whitbread British Book of the Year prizes.

It works by delaying the ignition timing very slightly to balance an inherent loss in combustion efficiency with increased pressure at the charging side of the turbo. This is achieved as a small amount of fuel/air mixture escapes through the exhaust valves and combusts in the hot exhaust manifold spooling the turbocharger creating higher usable pressure.  Overview  ALS was first used in the early days of turbocharged cars in Formula One racing circa mid to late 1980s, until fuel restrictions made its use unsuitable. Later it became a common feature in rally cars because of the increased turbo lag from the mandated restrictors at the intake manifold inlet. Due to the pressure drop across the restriction, the pressure ratio for a given boost level is much higher and the turbocharger must spin much faster to produce the same boost as when the engine operates without restriction. This increases turbo lag significantly compared to unrestricted turbochargers. An ALS requires an air bypass, generally done in one of two ways. The first method is to use a throttle air bypass; this may be an external bypass valve or a solenoid valve which opens the throttle 12-20 degrees. This allows air to bypass the closed throttle and to reach the engine. The second method is to use a bypass valve that feeds charge air directly to the exhaust manifold.  Methods  = Throttle bypass, or throttle kick ALS = The throttle bypass/throttle solenoid system is combined with ignition retardation and slight fuel enrichment (mainly to provide cooling), typically ignition occurs at 35-45¬∞ ATDC. This late ignition causes very little expansion of the gas in the cylinder; hence the pressure and temperature will still be very high when the exhaust valve opens. At the same time, the amount of torque delivered to the crankshaft will be very small (just enough to keep the engine running). The higher exhaust pressure and temperature combined with the increased mass flow is enough to keep the turbocharger spinning at high speed thus reducing lag. When the throttle is opened up again the ignition and fuel injection goes back to normal operation. Since many engine components are exposed to very high temperatures during ALS operation and also high-pressure pulses, this kind of system is very hard on the engine, turbocharger and exhaust manifold. For the latter not only the high temperatures are a problem but also the uncontrolled turbo speeds which can quickly destroy the turbocharger. In most applications the ALS is automatically shut down when the coolant reaches a temperature of 110‚Äì115 ¬∞C to prevent overheating. = Secondary air injection, or inlet bypass = An ALS working with a bypass valve that feeds air directly to nothing can be made more refined than the system described above. Some of the earliest systems of this type were used by Ferrari in F1. Another well- known application of this type of anti-lag system was in the WRC version of the 1995 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution III and Toyota Celica GT-Four (ST205). Brass tubes fed air from the turbocharger's Compressor Bypass Valve (CBV) to each of the exhaust manifold tracts, in order to provide the necessary air for the combustion of the fuel. The system was controlled by two pressure valves, operated by the ECU. Besides the racing version, the hardware of the anti-lag system was also installed in the 2500 \\"Group A homologation base WRC method car\\" street legal Celica GT-Fours. However, in these cars the system was disabled and inactive. The tubes and valves were only present for homologation reasons. On the Mitsubishi Evolution later series (Evolution IV-IX, JDM models only) the SAS (Secondary Air System) can be activated to provide anti-lag. Mitsubishi Antilag system diagram Secondary air injection ALS = Turbo and intercooler bypass (D-valve) = A method by which a large one-way check valve is inserted just prior to the throttle body, enabling air to bypass the turbo, intercooler, and piping during periods where there is negative air pressure at the throttle body inlet. This results in more air combusting, which means more air driving the turbine side of the turbo. As soon as positive pressure is reached in the intercooler hosing, the valve closes. Sometimes referred to as the Dan Culkin valve. When used in a MAF configuration, the D-valve should draw air through the MAF to maintain proper A/F ratios. This is not necessary in a speed-density configuration. = Ignition Retard & Fuel Dump (WOT) = Many programmable ECU's/ECU software (eCtune for example) also offer an \\"anti- lag\\" feature designed for spooling turbos off the line or between shifts. The end result is similar but the method of action is a bit different to the versions described above (which are far more common in high-level professional motorsports such as rally) and is more commonly used for launching & drag racing. When a car, ready for launch is being held at its launch RPM limit some ECUs (whether by switch or additional throttle) can be programmed to retard the ignition by quite a few degrees and add a lot more fuel. This causes the combustion event to happen much later, as the engine is driving the air/fuel mixture out of the cylinder, closer to the turbine, causing it to spool up either at an earlier RPM than it would normally ‚Äì assuming the engine unloaded waiting for launch or make more boost at the launch RPM than it would without engaging this feature. Some software can also engage this \\"fuel dump and ignition retard\\" anti-lag method by clutch input (used with full-throttle shifting), effectively making it work between shifts. Like other types of anti-lag, overuse of this type of anti-lag can cause damage to the turbine wheel, manifold and more due to the violent pressures created when the air/fuel mixture spontaneously combusts from the heat of the turbine housing or is ignited by a very retarded ignition event (happening after the exhaust stroke begins) and can potentially cause popping/flames. This form of \\"anti- lag\\" tends to work because the times it is active, the throttle is held at 100% allowing more air into the engine. Consequently, this type of anti-lag wouldn't work (well or at all) at part/closed throttle. = Using an MGU-H (Motor Generator Unit - Heat) to eliminate turbo lag = Modern Formula One power units are turbocharged, six cylinder engines in V formation, with an additional hybrid system. The hybrid system consists of two motor generator units, one Kinetic and a Heat. The MGU-H is used to eliminate turbo lag by essentially working as an electric motor that forces the turbine to rotate while the driver is off throttle, eliminating turbo lag almost completely. This is one of the most efficient methods of antilag, as the MGU-H also harvests heat energy while on the throttle and turns it into electrical energy, storing it in a battery.  Usage  World Rally Championship cars use anti-lag systems which feed air directly to the exhaust system. The system works by bypassing charge air directly to the exhaust manifold which acts as a combustor when fuel rich exhaust from the engine meets up with the fresh air from the bypass. This will provide a continuous combustion limited to the exhaust manifold which significantly reduces the heat and pressure loads on the engine and turbocharger. With the latest anti-lag systems the bypass valve can not only be opened or closed but it can actually control the flow of air to the exhaust manifold very accurately. The turbocharger is fitted with a turbo speed sensor and the engine management system has a map based on throttle position and car speed which is used to find a suitable turbocharger speed and boost pressure for every condition. When the engine alone can't provide enough exhaust energy to reach the turbo speed/boost demanded by the management system, the bypass valve opens and exhaust manifold combustion begins. This not only reduces turbo load, but it also allows boost to be produced at very low engine speeds where boost was previously limited by compressor surge or exhaust energy. With relatively high boost at low speeds, this makes the low end torque superior even to large naturally aspirated engines. This kind of system has reached such a refinement that it is even possible to use the system in a road car. A recent example is the Prodrive P2 prototype.

He was considered to be one of the most influential personalities in modern Telugu literature. Most of his writings were regarding women, especially the kind of difficulties women encounter‚Äîphysical as well as psychological‚Äîin society, from their families and from those with whom they are close. Chalam discussed how he believed women should face these problems. The themes philosophical tinge of his writings blended with a distinctive style which would earn for him an enviable place in the Telugu literary world. Chalam's writings have been an influence even to his contemporaries and are a growing influence among writers of this generation as well.  Life  Much that is known about Chalam's childhood comes from his 1972 autobiography titled Chalam. In it, he vividly mentions how he suffered beatings from his father and how his mother, residing at her parents‚Äô home at {Tenali} even after having been married and starting a family with her husband,who actually belong to {valluripalem of Krishna district} had to face a flurry of insults. Chalam brazenly puts across why he wrote his autobiography in its foreword: > \\"I hate autobiographies. By writing an autobiography, I am admitting to > myself and indirectly telling everybody that I am an important person, I > made lots of good things to help people and society and if I do not tell the > world about myself, there is great loss to the world and by not knowing > about me, the world is losing something. For a person like me who always > thinks and wonders, \\"Why was I born? And OK, I was born but why I did not > die immediately without polluting my surroundings? Writing an autobiography > and telling my story shamelessly is not a matter to be excused [...]\\" = Birth and childhood = Known more widely as \\"Chalam\\"', Gudipati Venkata Chalam was born on 18 May 1894 in Krishna district in India. His mother was Venkata Subbamma and his father was Kommuri Sambasivarao. In his childhood, his maternal grandfather adopted him and his surname was changed to \\"Gudipati\\" from \\"Kommuri\\". So he was raised in Tenali. He used to practice Hindu rituals very religiously. Before he completing, he had committed himself to an exhaustive study of Hindu epics as well as Hindu doctrinal teachings. The way his father abused his mother made an indelible impression on his young mind. Besides this, the manner in which his sister \\"Ammmanni\\" (Venkata Ramanamma, Dulla) was coerced into an arranged marriage against her will also made him concentrate on the difficulties that women faced in society. = Education, marriage and employment = Chalam joined Pithapuram Maharaja College in 1911. At that time, he was attracted by the preachings of Raghupati Venkata Ratnam Naidu‚Äîa social reformer and founder of the Brahma Samaj in Andhra. Chalam went to Chennai to study for his Bachelor of Arts. Before joining the college, he was married to Chitti Ranganayakamma. While studying for his degree in Chennai, he got his wife admitted into a convent for her education and he used to drop her at school on his bicycle. This was a spectacle for the people to see a husband dropping off the wife on his cycle. Chalam stopped wearing the sacred thread (Yagnopaveetham), started eating non-vegetarian food (Brahmins were strict vegetarians) and he used to mingle with all castes. This infuriated all his relatives and more so his father-in-law. His father-in-law banished him from entering his house. By that time, Chalam's wife's age was merely 13. When his mother-in-law died, Chalam and his friends were not allowed in his father-in-law's the house for the funeral, and they were served food outside. After completing his studies in Madras, Chalam joined in a job as tutor in Kakinada. Again, he started participating in the Brahma Samaj activities. He also became busy with his friendship with a beautiful girl named \\"Ratnamma\\" who happened to be his friend's sister-in-law. He worked as a teacher in Karimnagar. Then he joined in a job with Teacher's Training College in Rajahmundry. He later became a school inspector. About his job, Chalam wrote in his famous book \\"Musings\\" (in Telugu language) (Page 72, 5th Print in 2005) as follows: I am a stone, slave of the government, school inspector and for the poor mice like teachers, I am the cat. Chalam's daughter Chalam's daughter,Souris, a devotee of Ramana Maharshi, maintains an ashram at Bheemili, Visakhapatnam.

Philosophy  Chalam was a strong critic of the fundamental societal architecture of his time. He believed that the barriers created by the society precluded love and mutual understanding from human relationships. In a society that believed in children being indebted to their parents, he proclaimed caring for and bringing up of children as the fundamental duty as parents. He was widely shunned during his times especially for his advocacy of women's rights and his total rejection of the family system.  Adaptations  His Short story Doshagunam was adapted as a Telugu movie Grahanam.

Born in Salem, Massachusetts to housewright Joseph McIntire and Sarah (Ruck), he was a woodcarver by trade who grew into the practice of architecture. He married Elizabeth Field on October 10, 1778, and had one son. He built a simple home and workshop on Summer Street in 1786. Starting about 1780, McIntire was hired by Salem's pre-eminent merchant and America's first millionaire, Elias Hasket Derby, for whose extended family he built or remodeled a series of houses. McIntire taught himself the Palladian style of architecture from books, and soon had a reputation among the city's elite for designing elegant homes. In 1792, he entered a proposal in the competition for the United States Capitol. After 1797, McIntire worked in the style of Boston architect Charles Bulfinch, who had made fashionable here the neoclassical manner of Scottish architect Robert Adam. Unlike Bulfinch, however, whose designs were featured across the East Coast, McIntire built almost exclusively in New England. His wooden or brick houses were typically 3 stories tall, each with 4 rooms around a central hall. In 1799, he went into business with his brothers, Joseph and Angier McIntire, who erected the structures, while at the workshop he oversaw various ornamentations, including the swags, rosettes, garlands and sheaves of wheat which dominate the interior wooden surfaces. McIntire's Salem works include Peirce-Nichols, Peabody-Silsbee, Gardner-White-Pingree, and the Elias Haskett Derby residences. His public buildings, all in Salem, are Assembly Hall, Hamilton Hall, Washington Hall and the courthouse (the latter two have been demolished). McIntire Chair Metropolitan Museum of Art Samuel] The vase-back chair, originally part of a large set, was made for Elias Hasket Derby. The chair's overall design is based on plate 2 of George Hepplewhite's Cabinet- Maker and Upholsterer's Guide (London, 1788), but enriched considerably by the addition of relief carving to parts of the back and the front legs. The carved grape clusters in the lunette at the base of the splat and suspended from bowknots at the top of each leg are a motif which is associated with McIntire. He was a skilled artisan, especially in furniture, and his skill extended to sculpting. Among his works are busts of Voltaire and John Winthrop, the first governor of Massachusetts; both are now owned by the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester, Massachusetts. McIntire was buried in the Burying Point Cemetery, Salem, where his epitaph reads: \\"In Memory of Mr. Samuel McIntire who died Feb. 6, 1811, √Üt. 54. He was distinguished for Genius in Architecture, Sculpture, and Musick: Modest and sweet Manners rendered him pleasing: Industry, and Integrity respectable: He professed the Religion of Jesus in his entrance on manly life; and proved its excellence by virtuous Principle and unblemished conduct.\\" Samuel McIntire Historic District The Samuel McIntire Historic District was established in 1981, incorporating two previously established districts, Chestnut Street Historic District (1971) and Federal Street Area Historic District (1976) and adding some 249 structures on upper Essex, Broad, and Warren Streets, Dalton Parkway, and various streets in between. The District is named for Salem's celebrated architect-carver, Samuel McIntire, who lived and worked at 31 Summer Street. McIntire's first major commission, the Peirce-Nichols House (1782), and several of his mature works, including Hamilton Hall (1805), are preserved within the district. Chestnut Street, where there are many Federal Era townhouses designed by McIntire, stands as a monument to the mercantile and maritime ascendancy of Salem in the latter 18th and early 19th centuries. The District is considered to represent the greatest concentration of 17th and 18th century domestic structures anywhere in America and is one of the greatest concentrations of notable pre-1900 domestic structures extant in the U.S. With few exceptions, the major architectural styles common to the region during the 1640-1940 period are represented. Also included in the District are the Witch House or Jonathan Corwin House (circa 1642), churches, Broad Street Burial Ground (1655), several monuments, and the first Salem State Normal School Building (1854). World Record for Federal furniture In 2011, a mahogany side chair with carving attributed to Samuel McIntire sold at auction for $662,500, setting a world record for Federal furniture. The handmade and hand-carved chair made in the late 1790's was one of a set of eight originally purchased by Elizabeth (Crowninshield) and Elias Hasket Derby.

Ordered by Chile during the South American dreadnought race as the Almirante Cochrane, she was laid down before World War I. In early 1918 she was purchased by Britain for conversion to an aircraft carrier; this work was finished in 1924. Her completion was delayed by labour troubles and the possibility that she might be repurchased by Chile for reconversion into a battleship, as well as the need for comparative trials to determine the optimum layout for aircraft carriers. The ship was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet and then later to the China Station, spending very little time in home waters other than for periodic refits. Eagle spent the first nine months of World War II in the Indian Ocean searching for German commerce raiders. During the early part of the war, the Fleet Air Arm was desperately short of fighters and Eagle was equipped solely with Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers until late 1940. She was transferred to the Mediterranean in May 1940, where she escorted convoys to Malta and Greece and attacked Italian shipping, naval units and bases in the Eastern Mediterranean. The ship also participated in the Battle of Calabria in July but her aircraft failed to score any hits when they attempted to torpedo Italian cruisers during the battle. Whenever Eagle was not at sea, her aircraft were disembarked and used ashore. The ship was relieved by a more modern carrier in March 1941 and ordered to hunt for Axis shipping in the Indian Ocean and the South Atlantic. Her aircraft sank a German blockade runner and disabled a German oil tanker in mid-1941 but did not find any other Axis ships before the ship was ordered home for a refit in October. After completing an extensive refit in early 1942, the ship made trips delivering fighter aircraft to Malta to boost its air defences in the first half of 1942. Eagle was torpedoed and sunk by the on 11 August 1942 while escorting a convoy to Malta during Operation Pedestal.  Design and description  = Construction and conversion = In 1911, the Chilean Navy ordered one super- dreadnought battleship, with an option for a second ship, each to be armed with ten 14-inch (356 mm) and sixteen six-inch (152 mm) guns, that were named and Almirante Cochrane.Brook, p. 146 Almirante Latorre was laid down in December 1911, followed by Almirante Cochrane at the Armstrong yards at Newcastle upon Tyne on 20 February 1913. On the outbreak of the First World War, construction of the two ships was suspended. As Almirante Latorre was almost complete, she was purchased for the Royal Navy, entering service as in 1915. Almirante Cochrane was almost complete up to the forecastle, although her side armour had not yet been installed when war broke out. No work was carried out during the war until the British decided to complete her as an aircraft carrier for the Royal Navy. She was therefore purchased from Chile on 28 February 1918 to be converted into the carrier HMS Eagle.Gardiner and Gray, pp. 38, 70 She was the fourteenth ship of the Royal Navy to bear that name.Colledge and Warlow, p. 108 The Director of Naval Construction began preliminary design work even before the ship was purchased and submitted an outline design on 8 February 1918. This design had a full-length flight deck and its most distinctive features were the two islands separated by the flight deck. Each island was to be long, containing two funnels and a tripod mast. Although they were staggered to make it more difficult for an enemy ship to estimate the ship's course, they were to be connected to each other with heavy bracing. The bridge was to be mounted on top of this bracing which left a clear height of for the aircraft on the flight deck. There was to be a wide space between the islands where the aircraft were to be assembled before taking off. Aircraft would be transported between the hangar and the flight deck by two aircraft lifts (elevators). A crane was to be located at the aft end of each island to lift aircraft aboard and to recover seaplanes. Bulk petrol storage consisted of in tins stowed on the forecastle deck and protected by plating. Two ready-use tanks near the islands would allow aircraft on the flight deck to refuel. The ship's planned armament consisted of nine 6-inch guns and four anti-aircraft guns mounted on the platform between the islands.Friedman, pp. 74‚Äì75 Eagle retained the battleship's mixture of coal and fuel oil, but the quantities were increased to of coal and of oil, as the forward and rear 14-inch magazines and shell rooms were converted to be used as oil tanks. Line drawing of Almirante Latorre, illustrating what Eagle would have looked like if she had been finished in her original configuration. Shaded areas show the extent of her armour. Based on trials with , in which pilots were found generally to turn to port when recovering from an aborted landing, the design was revised to eliminate the port island in April 1918. The starboard island was lengthened to and its width was reduced to to minimise air turbulence. The island contained the bridge, both funnels and the tripod mast that carried the fire-control directors for the armament. At the request of Admiral David Beatty, commander of the Grand Fleet, the main armament was increased to 12 six-inch guns, including one mounted on the island, and eighteen torpedo tubes were added, three triple fixed mounts on each broadside, in case the ship met German light cruisers at night. The anti-aircraft armament was reduced to a single 4-inch gun mounted on the island between the funnels as Beatty believed that the ship's own fighters would be her best defence against enemy aircraft. This design was approved in June, although work had begun earlier.Friedman, pp. 74‚Äì76 The armour planned for her upper belt was used to protect the ship's waterline. The already-completed superstructure was removed as were the barbettes for the 14-inch guns.Friedman, p. 75 Eagle was launched on 8 June 1918 and was towed downriver to the shipbuilder's High Walker yard for fitting-out ten days later. The boiler uptakes were re-routed and the existing openings were plated over. The existing upper deck became the floor of the hangar deck and a new superstructure was built above it. The flight deck was thick and served as the uppermost strength deck, or main supporting deck, of the ship. When the war ended in November 1918, the ship was about nine months from completion.Brown, p. 250 Construction was slowed by industrial action after the war, and was suspended on 21 October 1919 as Chile wanted to repurchase the ship and have it re-converted to a battleship.Friedman, p. 79 The ¬£2.5 million cost of doing so would have been higher than the ¬£1.5 million offered by the Chileans and the Admiralty decided to retain the ship. The Royal Navy needed to carry out flying trials with a carrier fitted with an island, and the Admiralty approved the use of Eagle on 11 November. Armstrong Whitworth plated over the openings for the undelivered elevators on the flight deck (which had been cancelled when they could not meet the specifications), finished the rear funnel, removed the torpedo tubes, and plated over the forward funnel uptakes before she sailed to the Royal dockyard at Portsmouth for the modifications necessary for the trials on 20 April 1920.Brown, pp. 250‚Äì51 Only two of her boilers, converted to run on fuel oil only, could be used during the trials.Brown, p. 251 = Flight trials = The trials principally tested the longitudinal arresting gear used previously on the small aircraft carrier .Brown, p. 252 They were not intended to stop landing aircraft‚Äîthe landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwind‚Äîbut rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and falling off the flight deck.Friedman, p. 95 Initially, the arresting gear was about long and was installed too far forward. Over the course of the trials it was moved further to the rear and lengthened to a total of .Friedman, pp. 79‚Äì81 The ship was commanded during the trials by Captain Wilmot Nicholson, who had previously commanded the carrier in 1918, and the Royal Air Force representative was Group Captain Charles Samson. Taxiing trials began on 10 May with Sopwith Camel fighters and Parnall Panther reconnaissance aircraft while the ship was still docked. Flights over and around the ship to evaluate air currents over the flight deck and around the island began shortly afterward and the first on-board landing was made on 1 June. Larger aircraft like the Bristol F2B fighter, the Sopwith Cuckoo torpedo bomber, and the De Havilland DH.9 bomber were also evaluated during the trials. They were generally successful with only 12 minor accidents in 143 landings in all types of weather conditions, although they did reveal that aircraft landing aboard carriers would need landing gear fitted with shock absorbers to handle the impact of landing on a pitching deck.Friedman, pp. 81‚Äì82 Group Captain Samson strongly preferred the elimination of the island entirely, but Nicholson recommended that the ship be retained for service, although he was not satisfied with the size and shape of the island. He also recommended that Eagle be converted to burn fuel oil exclusively and that the removal of the 6-inch guns in exchange for anti-aircraft guns would allow the tripod mast in the island to be eliminated, since it would not then be required for fire control purposes .Friedman, p. 82 = Description = The ship was paid off on 16 November, but did not begin construction to a revised design until 24 March 1921 at Portsmouth. The Admiralty accepted some of Nicholson's suggestions, but not all. The shape and size of the island was modified in accordance with the results from wind tunnel testing at the National Physical Laboratory, but the 6-inch guns were retained. The forward edge of the flight deck was faired into the ship's bow to smooth out the air currents over the bow and the 4-inch anti-aircraft guns were mounted on and around the island. The forward elevator was moved to the forward end of the hangar. After construction began, anti-torpedo bulges were added, deep, and the petrol tin storage room was replaced by a tank. The ship's designed fuel capacity was , but this was increased to when she was bulged. However, of this amount was required to act as ballast to offset the weight of the island and its equipment.Brown, pp. 252‚Äì53 Eagle had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. She displaced at standard load. Each of the ship's four sets of Brown-Curtis geared steam turbines drove one 3-bladed propeller.Brown, p. 272 They were powered by 32 Yarrow small-tube boilers. During her sea trials on 9‚Äì10 September 1923, the turbines produced and gave Eagle a speed of , but this caused leaks in the turbine joints and she was limited to a maximum of in service. She had a range of at .Friedman, pp. 82‚Äì83, 366 The ship's flight deck was long and her hangar was long and wide. Its minimum height was , and it was equipped with four steel shutter fire curtains to isolate any fires in the hangar. The forward lift's dimensions were and the aft lift was . The fore-and-aft arresting gear was long and extended the length of the flight deck between the edges of the lifts.Brown, pp. 253‚Äì54, 273 A large crane with a radius was positioned behind the island. The ship's aircraft capacity was 25 to 30 and, in 1939, the ship's crew totalled 41 officers and 750 men, exclusive of the air group.Friedman, p. 83, 366 For self-defence against enemy warships, Eagle had nine BL Mk XVII 6-inch guns, three at the stern and six along both sides of the ship. The ship carried 200 rounds per gun. Two of her five QF Mk V 4-inch AA guns were positioned on the flight deck in front of the island while a third was behind the island. The remaining two guns were mounted on top of the island, one between the two funnels, and each gun was provided with 150 rounds.  Career  = Inter-war = Aerial view of Eagle in 1931, prior to her refit Eagle was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet on 7 June 1924 after she commissioned on 26 February and finished working up. She was the largest aircraft carrier in the world at the time and embarked 24 aircraft in four six-aircraft flights of the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Air Force. These consisted of No. 402 Flight with Fairey Flycatchers, No. 422 Flight with Blackburn Blackburn reconnaissance aircraft, No. 440 Flight (Supermarine Seagull flying boats) and No. 460 Flight with Blackburn Dart torpedo bombers.Brown, p. 254 While in the Mediterranean, one flight usually operated ashore at either RAF Hal Far, Malta, or Aboukir, Egypt. The Seagulls proved to be unsatisfactory in service and they were replaced by Fairey IIIDs in January 1925. Avro Bison spotters of No. 421B Flight operated aboard for a time in late 1925. Eagle sailed for Devonport at the end of 1925 for a brief refit where the longitudinal arresting gear was removed as it had been found to be virtually useless in service. Two single QF 2-pounder pom-pom light anti-aircraft guns were added forward of the 4-inch guns on the flight deck in front of the island and the ship's petrol capacity was increased to . When the ship returned to the Mediterranean after the completion of her refit in 1926, the Bisons of No. 448 Flight replaced No. 422 Flight. In 1928 she was joined by which allowed the fleet to experiment with multi-carrier operations. Eagle was refitted again in early 1929 and a salt-water spray system was fitted to fight hangar fires. On 29 June 1929, she rescued Spanish Air Force Major Ram√≥n Franco ‚Äì brother of future Spanish dictator Francisco Franco ‚Äì and his crew, who had been adrift in the North Atlantic Ocean since 22 June when their flying boat, the Dornier Do J Wal (\\"Whale\\") Numancia was forced down due to fuel exhaustion on the first leg of an attempt to fly westward around the world.O'Connor, Derek, \\"The Other Franco,\\" Aviation History, January 2018, p. 59. When Eagle returned to the Mediterranean later in the year, both 440 and 448 Flights had re-equipped with Fairey IIIF reconnaissance aircraft. Eagle departed Malta on 8 January 1931, en route to Portsmouth to load the latest carrier aircraft for a demonstration at the British Industries Exhibition at Buenos Aires, Argentina. She returned to the Mediterranean to participate in the summer fleet exercises before sailing for Devonport where she began a lengthy refit in August.Brown, pp. 254‚Äì55 The ship's boilers were replaced during the refit and the 4-inch gun between the funnels was replaced by an eight-barrel QF 2-pounder Mark V pom-pom mount. A single quadruple Vickers .50 machine gun mount was added on the starboard aft side of the flight deck. Four fire-fighting foam generators were also fitted on the flight deck. A single High Angle Control System (HACS) director was fitted on the aft end of the control top on the tripod mast. The crew, now numbering 753 sailors and 253 airmen, benefited from improved accommodation. The refit was completed on 28 November 1932, but personnel shortages prevented her from working up until April 1933.Brown, pp. 255, 257 Eagle at Hong Kong in the 1930s. The depot ship HMS Medway is in the background Following the refit, Eagle was sent to the Far East, serving on the China Station throughout 1934, with her aircraft being deployed against pirate ships and their bases. The tropical heat caused problems in cooling the bomb magazines, and the food storage rooms and the ventilation proved to be barely satisfactory.Brown, pp. 257‚Äì58 Another quadruple .50 machine gun mount was added forward of the 2-pounder gun on the flight deck and the original mounting was shifted over to the port side.Friedman, p. 86 During this time, the ship's air group comprised nine Hawker Osprey fighters of 803 Squadron and 12 Fairey IIIFs of 824 Squadron; the latter unit was re-designated as 825 Squadron in October 1934. 803 Squadron transferred to when she relieved Eagle at the end of 1934. They were replaced by Blackburn Baffin torpedo bombers of 812 Squadron when Eagle arrived in the Mediterranean in February 1935. Both squadrons remained behind at RAF Hal Far when the ship sailed for Devonport for another refit in June.Sturtivant, pp. 209, 266Brown, p. 258 Eagle was paid off until her refit began in early 1936. Transverse arresting gear was installed and a second octuple pom-pom replaced the 2-pounders in front of the island. Two more quadruple .50 machine gun mounts were installed in sponsons on either side of the bow. The capacity of her bomb magazines was also increased during this refit, and the ship's ventilation and insulation arrangements were improved as well. She was sent back to the Far East in 1937 with only nine Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers (cloth-covered biplanes) of 813 Squadron aboardBrown, pp. 258‚Äì59 as well as nine more Swordfish to re- equip 824 Squadron when it transferred from Hermes in April.Sturtivant, p. 286 Captain Clement Moody commanded Eagle from 1 January 1937 until relieved by Captain A. R. M. Bridge on 16 June 1939. In August 1939 the ship's crew was exchanged in Hong Kong and Eagle sailed for Singapore to begin a short refit on 12 August.Smith, pp. 15‚Äì16 = World War II =  1939‚Äì1941  When World War Two began the following month, the ship had just completed her refit in Singapore. She put to sea a few days later and began searching for German merchant ships in company with the light cruiser and escorted by the destroyer . A Swordfish discovered the freighter south of the port of Padang on Sumatra and Birmingham was ordered to intercept it while Eagle continued her air patrols. She arrived in Colombo, Ceylon, on 10 September and until 5 October she searched the Indian Ocean for German ships between the west coast of India and the Maldive Islands with the light cruiser . Eagle was then assigned to Force I together with the heavy cruisers and , to search the Indian Ocean for the pocket battleship and other German commerce raiders. In mid-December her boilers and bottom were cleaned during a period of maintenance in Durban, South Africa.Smith, pp. 20‚Äì23, 29‚Äì30 Eagle in Alexandria harbour, December 1940 Eagle continued to patrol the Indian Ocean in 1940, but escorted a large Australian troop convoy to Suez early in the year. While in the vicinity of the Nicobar Islands on 14 March, a bomb accidentally exploded, killing 14 men. The damage to the ship was mostly confined to the bomb magazines, although two generators were knocked out. The explosion flashed upwards through the port bomb lift and ignited the wing on one Swordfish stowed in the hangar. All but four of the aircraft were damaged by the corrosive salt-water spray system when the fire was doused. She was repaired at Singapore between 15 March and 9 May when the ship sailed for Colombo en route to the Mediterranean, which she reached on 26 May. In June three crated Gloster Sea Gladiators were found in storage at Dekheila and these aircraft became the only fighters available for the entire fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean.Smith, pp. 30‚Äì40, 44 Flying from shore bases on 5 July, 813 Squadron attacked Tobruk harbour in a combined attack with the RAF at dusk, sinking the and the freighter ,Smith, p. 47 and blowing the bow off the destroyer . Two other merchantmen had to be beached before they sank.Rohwer, p. 31 During the Battle of Calabria on 9 July, 813 Squadron was used to search and track the Italian fleet while 824 Squadron made two unsuccessful attacks on Italian cruisers without loss. On the evening of 10 July,Smith, pp. 49‚Äì52 Eagles aircraft attacked Augusta harbour in Sicily, sinking the destroyer .Rohwer, p. 32 While under heavy aerial attack on 13 July, pilots of the Sea Gladiator Flight shot down three Italian bombers.Gustavsson and Slongo, pp. 78‚Äì79 On the night of 20 July, six aircraft from 824 Squadron, flying from Sidi Barrani,Smith, p. 53 sank the destroyers and as well as the freighter .Rohwer, p. 33 While providing distant cover to a convoy bound for Greece, one Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 medium bomber was shot down on 29 July by Eagles Sea Gladiators while attacking the fleet.Gustavsson and Slongo, p. 89 On 22 August three Swordfish from 824 Squadron, flying from Sidi Barrani, attacked and sank the and the depot ship Monte Gargano in the Gulf of Bomba. The ships were carrying eight frogmen and four manned torpedoes to attack British shipping in Alexandria harbour.Gustavsson and Slongo, p. 117 In September, she was joined by the carrier and both ships attacked Italian airbases on Rhodes on 9 September. Eagles 12 Swordfish were late in taking off and attacked the airfield at Maritza after the Italians had been alerted by the earlier attack by Illustrious aircraft on the nearby airbase at Collato. Four aircraft were shot down by the defending Fiat CR.32 and Fiat CR.42 fighters, but two SM.79s were destroyed on the ground and four other aircraft were damaged.Shores, et al., p. 128 These losses were the ship's heaviest in any single mission of the war.Smith, pp. 55‚Äì56 While covering another convoy to Malta on 12 October, she was damaged by near misses from SM.79s based in Sicily. The damage to her aviation fuel system was not immediately apparent and she covered another convoy later that month.Gustavsson and Slongo, p. 162 While returning to Alexandria, her aircraft attacked Maltezana seaplane base on Rhodes on 27 October.Smith, p. 66 Four of her Swordfish from 824 Squadron had been disembarked earlier and were flown to Fuka Landing Ground for a night attack on Tobruk harbour. The 824 Squadron aircraft distracted the defences with 250-pound bombs, while the 12 other Swordfish laid mines.Gustavsson and Slongo, pp. 165‚Äì166 On 28 October, Eagle and the rest of the Mediterranean Fleet patrolled off the west coast of Greece for a few days hoping to intercept the Italian Navy if it supported the Italian Army in their invasion of Greece, but no contact was made.Smith, pp. 66‚Äì67 When the ship was examined on 5 November, her aviation fuel system was leaking and required repairs. Five of her aircraft were transferred to Illustrious for an attack on 11 November on Taranto (Operation Judgement), whilst Eagle remained in Alexandria. One of Eagles Swordfish was shot down by the intense Italian anti-aircraft fire. The ship covered multiple convoys to Greece and Malta during the rest of November.Smith, pp. 67‚Äì75 Six of her aircraft bombed Tripoli harbour during the night of 24/25 November without loss.Gustavsson and Slongo, p. 200 Eagle spent most of December in Alexandria, but her aircraft supported the ground war, most notably when they spotted for the battleships and during the bombardment of Bardia on 2 January 1941. In mid-January, the ship covered a convoy to Greece, but bad weather foiled plans to attack Italian bases en route. After her return, her aircraft complement was reorganised to include more fighters, as Eagle now had sole responsibility for fighter cover over the fleet after the crippling of Illustrious by German dive bombers on 11 January. In order to make room for the fighters, one of the Swordfish squadrons was disembarked and used to support the ground war. When Eagle was covering another convoy to Malta in mid-February, the ship carried nine Fairey Fulmars of 805 Squadron, five Sea Gladiators and six Swordfish.Smith, pp. 77‚Äì83 After the carrier arrived on 9 March to relieve Illustrious, orders were cancelled that would have transferred Eagle to the South Atlantic to hunt for German commerce raiders and the ship did not leave Alexandria until 9 April.Smith, pp. 84‚Äì85 In the meantime, both Swordfish squadrons were transferred to Port Sudan to operate against Italian shipping in Massawa, in Italian East Africa, on 25 March. They were very successful and returned to the ship on 13 April after she had passed through the Suez Canal.Brown, p. 264 After she reached Mombasa, Kenya, on 26 April, she was ordered to sea on 29 April on an unsuccessful search for a raider in the Indian Ocean. The ship was then ordered on 1 May to proceed to Durban, South Africa, to rendezvous with the battleship and to proceed to Gibraltar. After the two ships arrived in Freetown, Sierra Leone, on 25 May to refuel, Nelson was ordered to continue to Gibraltar, but Eagles orders changed and she was now charged with hunting for German supply ships in the South Atlantic. Captain A. R. M. Bridge was relieved by E. G. H. Rushbrooke at this time.Smith, pp. 108‚Äì116 Eagle began searching the South Atlantic on 29 May, usually accompanied by Dorsetshire or the light cruiser . The carrier's Swordfish discovered, bombed and sank the blockade runner Elbe on 6 June. The oil tanker Lothringen was captured on 15 June by Dunedin after it had been bombed and strafed by several Swordfish. The ship continued patrolling without incident except for a hangar fire that killed one aircraft mechanic on 20 September. All but four of the ship's Swordfish were damaged by the spray used to put out the fire, but the ship herself was undamaged.Smith, pp. 116‚Äì132 In October 1941, Eagle was ordered to return to Britain for a refit at Gladstone Dock, Liverpool. She arrived off Greenock on 26 October and was docked at Liverpool on 1 November.Smith, pp. 134‚Äì137 The quadruple .50 machine guns were replaced by 12 manually operated automatic 20 mm Oerlikon light anti-aircraft guns, six in sponsons on each side of the flight deck, and the crews of the four-inch AA guns were given protection from splinters by the addition of zarebas around each weapon. The HACS was moved to the front of the control top and fitted with a Type 285 gunnery radar. A Type 290 air warning radar was also installed. The ship's oil fuel capacity was reduced to in exchange for an increase in her petrol storage of . This reduced her range to at a speed of .Friedman, pp. 86‚Äì87 Eagles refit was completed on 9 January 1942 and she was working up for the next five weeks. She joined the convoy WS16 en route to Gibraltar on 16 February and reached it a week later. 813 and 824 Squadrons had rejoined the ship with their Swordfish and they were supplemented by four Sea Hurricane 1B fighters from a detachment of 804 Squadron and the Fighter Flight of 813 Squadron.Smith, pp. 141‚Äì143Sturtivant, pp. 178, 212‚Äì213 Because their wings could not fold, they could not use either lift and remained on the flight deck at all times. The ship reached Gibraltar on 23 February and was assigned to Force H.Smith, pp. 142‚Äì143  Battle of Malta  HMS Eagle and HMS Malaya, from HMS Argus serving with Force H in the Mediterranean, 7 March 1942 Upon Eagles arrival in Gibraltar, 824 Squadron transferred to RAF North Front and the ship loaded 15 Supermarine Spitfire fighters brought to Gibraltar by the carrier .Sturtivant, p. 262Nailer, p. 160 These aircraft were partly assembled dockside and hoisted aboard for final assembly. They were too big to fit below deck and remained on the flight deck, where they impeded the operations of Eagles aircraft, except for those few also carried on the flight deck, until the ferried aircraft were flown off.Shores, Cull and Malizia 1991, pp. 108‚Äì109 On 27 February 1942, she sailed to deliver the Spitfires to Malta, escorted by the battleship , Argus, the cruiser , and nine destroyers, but the operation had to be cancelled when the long-range fuel tanks of the Spitfires proved defective. The problems were not rectified until 7 March, when the 15 Spitfires were successfully flown off to Malta. Upon her return, the ship's engines required repairs that lasted until 13 March.Smith, pp. 144‚Äì146 Nine more Spitfires were delivered to Malta on 21 March and an additional seven on 29 March.Nailer, p. 161 After her return, her steering gear required extensive repairs that lasted until the end of April.Smith, p. 146 Eagle listing to port and sinking, 11 August 1942 As part of Operation Bowery, Eagle rendezvoused on the night of 7/8 May with the American carrier , carrying 47 Spitfires, while Eagle had landed her entire aircraft complement to make room for 17 Spitfires of her own. Sixty of them arrived safely at Malta. For the next operation on 17 May, the Swordfish and Sea Hurricanes of 813 Squadron flew back on board to join the 17 Spitfires and six Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers destined for Malta. The fighters flew off without incident, but engine problems forced all of the Albacores to return.Nailer, p. 162 After they had landed, the ship was attacked by a half-dozen SM.79 torpedo bombers which failed to score any hits. The radar-guided guns of the escorting light cruiser, , were instrumental in driving off the determined Italian aircraft.Smith, pp. 151‚Äì153 Eagle disembarked all of her aircraft, except for her four Sea Hurricanes, to make room for 31 Spitfires and flew them off on 3 June during Operation Style. Another 32 were flown off on 9 June during Operation Salient. Later in the month, the ship provided air cover for another convoy, Operation Harpoon, which departed for Malta at the same time as the Operation Vigorous convoy did, from the opposite direction. A dozen Sea Hurricanes of 801 Squadron and four Fulmars from 807 Squadron reinforced the four Sea Hurricanes of 813's Fighter Flight to deal with the heavy air attacks anticipated.Smith, pp. 156‚Äì158 The convoy was subject to heavy air attacks by both the German and Italian Air Forces; Eagles Sea Hurricanes managed to disrupt many attacks, claiming nine aircraft destroyed and a further two probably destroyed for the loss of one Sea Hurricane from 813 Squadron and three Fulmars.Brown, p. 268 The escorts reached Gibraltar on 17 June and did not make the next delivery of aircraft until 14 July when 32 Spitfires were flown off to Malta (Operation Pinpoint). During this time, the carrier's aircraft complement consisted solely of six Sea Hurricanes of 801 Squadron. Another 29 Spitfires as well as four Swordfish of 824 Squadron were loaded on 20 July and the Spitfires were flown off the following day.Nailer, p. 163 Earlier in the day, the ship was unsuccessfully attacked by the .Smith, pp. 159‚Äì161 Eagle covered Operation Pedestal together with the carriers and . Eagle carried 16 Sea Hurricanes of 801 and 813 Squadrons as well as four reserve aircraft for the operation.Smith, p. 163 On the early afternoon of 11 August, Eagle was hit by four torpedoes from the , commanded by Helmut Rosenbaum, and sank within four minutes, south of Cape Salinas at position . Losses in the sinking included 131 officers and ratings, mainly from the ship's propulsion machinery spaces.Smith, p. 189 Four Sea Hurricanes from 801 were aloft when the ship was torpedoed, and they landed on other carriers; the remaining sixteen went down with the ship.Brown, p. 271 The destroyers and and the tug Jaunty rescued 67 officers and 862 sailors.

Rao wrote the play Kanyasulkam in 1892, which is often considered the greatest play in the Telugu language. One of the pioneers of Indian theatre, Rao holds the titles Kavisekhara and Abyudaya Kavitha Pithamahudu.20th Century Telugu Luminaries, Potti Sriramulu Telugu University, Hyderabad, 2005 In 1910, Rao scripted the widely known Telugu patriotic song \\"Desamunu Preminchumanna\\". In 1897, Kanyasulkam was published (by Vavilla Ramaswamy Sastrulu and Sons, Madras) and dedicated to Maharaja Ananda Gajapati. Apparao (along with his brother Syamala Rao) wrote several English poems. His Sarangadhara, published in \\"Indian Leisure Hour\\", was well received. The editor of the Calcutta-based \\"Rees and Ryot\\", Sambhu Chandra Mukherji read it and re-published it in his magazine. Gundukurti Venkata Ramanayya, editor of the \\"Indian Leisure Hour\\", encouraged Apparao greatly during the same period. In 1891, Gurajada was appointed to the post of Epigraphist to the Maharaja of Vizianagaram.  Early life and education  Gurajada was born on 21 September 1862 at his maternal uncle's home in Rayavaram village, near Yelamanchili, Visakhapatnam district. His parents were Venkata Rama Dasu and Kausalyamma. Gurajada lived most of his life in and around Vizianagaram in what was then called as Kalinga Rajyam. He and his father before him were both employed by the princely state of Vizianagaram. Gurajada enjoyed a close relationship with the ruling family during his adult life. He had his initial schooling in Cheepurupalli while his father was working there. His remaining schooling was done at Vizianagaram after his father died. During that time, he was taken care of by the then M.R. College Principal, C. Chandrasekhara Sastri who provided him free lodging and boarding. He completed his matriculation in 1882 and obtained F.A. in 1884. Soon after, he was employed as a teacher in M.R. High School in 1884 with a salary of Rs.25. In 1887, Gurajada spoke at a Congress Party meeting in Vizianagaram. His daughter Voleti Lakshmi Narasamma was born in 1887. He was simultaneously involved in social work and became a member of the Voluntary Service Corps in Visakhapatnam in 1888. He was elected vice-president of the Ananda Gajapati Debating club in 1889. His son Gurajada Venkata Ramadasu was born in 1890. In 1891 he was promoted to Lecturer (Level III) with a salary of Rs.125. He taught the F.A. and B.A. classes several subjects including English Grammar, Sanskrit Literature, Translation, Greek and Roman Histories. His younger brother Syamala Rao died in 1892 while studying at Madras Law College. = 1908 Congress session at Madras = In 1911, he was appointed to the Board of Studies by Madras University. The same year, Gurajada and his friends started the Andhra Sahitya Parishat to promote use of spoken dialects. The next year, he was invited to attend the meeting of the Bangeeya Sahitya Parishat (Bengal Literary Association) at Calcutta.  Retirement and death  Gurajada retired in 1913, and the then Madras University honored him with the title \\"Emeritus Fellow\\". He died on 30 November 1915. = Kanyasulkam = Gurajada Apparao house (presently a memorial library) in Vizianagaram, Andhra Pradesh Poetic lines by Sri Gurajada Apparao garu Kanyasulkam is about the deplorable condition of widows in traditional Brahmin families in the Andhra region of India during the 19th century. The play is a highly thought- provoking social drama dealing with social issues relevant to the time. Gurajada Apparao was deeply troubled by the double standards, hypocrisy and social inequalities in the Indian society. The English preface to the first edition of his play states: \\"Such a scandalous state of things is a disgrace to society, and literature can not have a higher function than to show up such practices and give currency to a high standard of moral ideas. Until reading habits prevail among masses, one must look only to the stage to exert such healthy influence.\\" Perhaps for the first time in Telugu literary history, a prostitute was given a very positive image so much so that she is shown to better the lives of many people during the course of the play. The play is ageless in the sense that its projection of the Indian mindset and psyche is very relevant and applicable in Indian Society today. The play was, in some ways, ahead of its time and was very bold in criticizing the popular opinions and practices during that era. It frequently jabs at the male-dominated society of India, by bringing to the forefront certain egoistic idiosyncrasies of a typical Indian male, in an unflattering manner. It also questions the practices of witchcraft, sorcery, and their popular usage in medical practice during that period in India. Personal life Life History of Gurajada Apparao displayed at his house, which is a memorial library now Gurajada married Appala Narasamma in 1885. He continued his studies and graduated with B.A. (Philosophy major and Sanskrit minor) in 1886. For some period during 1886, he worked as Head Clerk in the Deputy Collector's office. On Vijayadasami day, 1887, he joined as a Lecturer (Level IV) in M.R. College with a salary of Rs.100. Around the same time, he was introduced to Maharajah Pusapati Ananda Gajapati Raju (1850‚Äì1897). In 1905, Gurajada's mother died. In 1906, his close friend P.T. Srinivasa Iyyangar, principal of Mrs. A.V.N. College, Visakhapatnam started an association to promote curriculum reform in high schools. One of the chief aims was to introduce spoken dialects. Along with him, J.A. Yates (1874‚Äì1951) -a British civil servant, Gidugu and Gurajada were the principal members. Another friend S. Srinivasa Iyengar (1874‚Äì1941) also gave a lot of support and encouragement. Incidentally, this Srinivasa Iyengar was a well-known lawyer and was the President of AICC (All India Congress Committee) annual session at Guwahati in 1926. Gurajada's childhood friend and classmate in Chipurupalli, Gidugu Rammurty (1863‚Äì1940) was his school of thought. Bibliography =Other Literature works= *The Cook (N/A.

Generally, but not always, the consignee is the same as the receiver. If a sender dispatches an item to a receiver via a delivery service, the sender is the consignor, the recipient is the consignee, and the deliverer is the carrier. A brief statement of law This is a difficult area of law in that it regulates the mass transportation industry which cannot always guarantee arrival on time or that goods will not be damaged in the course of transit. Furthermore, two other problems are that unpaid consignors or freight carriers may wish to hold goods until payment is made, and fraudulent individuals may seek to take delivery in place of the legitimate consignees. The key to resolving such disputes lies in the documentation. The standard form of contract is a bill of lading which, in international shipping law, is simply a contract for the carriage of goods entered into between the shipper and the carrier that is not a charter party. It is always a term of that contract that the carrier must deliver the goods to a specific receiver. = Documentation and legal requirements for delivery = A straight bill of lading by land or sea, or air waybill are not documents of title to the goods they represent. They do no more than require delivery of the goods to the named consignee and (subject to the shipper's ability to redirect the goods) to no other. This differs from an \\"order\\" or \\"bearer\\" bill of lading which are possessory title documents and negotiable, i.e. they can be endorsed and so transfer the right to take delivery to the last endorsee. This aspect of shipping law is regulated by the Hague Rules, and the laws of individual countries, e.g. the UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 and the U.S. Pomerene Act 1916. There is some international dispute as to whether the consignee on a straight bill must produce the bill in order to take delivery. The U.S. position is that the person taking delivery must prove his or her identity but, as in Hong Kong, there is no need to present the bill itself. In the UK there are conflicting obiter dicta in \\"The Rafaela S\\" [2003] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 113 and \\"The Happy Ranger\\" [2002] 2 AER (Comm) 23, so the matter must remain unclear even though there are serious problems, for example, arising from the everyday occurrence of cargo being discharged against letters of indemnity when original bills of lading are not yet available to be presented at the discharge port. = Consignee rights = The rights of the consignee under an air waybill are regulated by the Warsaw Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, 1929 and the Montreal Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air 1999 and the relevant state laws (which may be one law chosen as the proper law by the parties, or any combination of laws representing the seller, buyer, consignor, and carrier.) This is very important as per export documents. The receiver can be different than that of the consignee. Category:Freight transport Category:Legal documents Category:Contract law Category:Transport law =IMPORTANCE= It is helpful to give and take the information about to be paid and received. It helps to settle dispute as it includes the detail about the goods and terms of trade and payment. It informs the selling price to the consignee. It helps to know the quality , the quantity, the price and the discount to the importer.

Wilhelm With√∂ft (, tr. ; October 14, 1847 ‚Äì August 10, 1904), more commonly known as Wilgelm Vitgeft, was a Russo-German admiral in the Imperial Russian Navy, noted for his service in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905. Biography Vitgeft was born in Odessa, and was of German ancestry and Lutheran faith. He graduated from the Sea Cadet Corps in 1868 and subsequently circumnavigated the globe on the clipper Wsadnik. After his return to Russia, he was promoted to warrant officer in 1870 and to lieutenant in 1873. From 1875 to 1878 he received specialized training as a naval artillery and mine warfare expert. Thereafter he served in various functions on ships of the Russian Baltic Fleet. In 1885, as a captain of the second rank, he was assigned his first command, that of the gunboat Groza. He subsequently served as an inspector of works for the Marine Technical Committee, and as the Assistant Chief Inspector of Mines, was responsible for testing naval mines. In 1892, Vitgeft took over command of the cruiser Voyevoda and was promoted to captain 1st rank in 1894. On 26 October 1899 With√∂ft was promoted to rear admiral and was transferred to the Russian Pacific Fleet. He was awarded the Order of St. Stanislaus (1st class with Swords) for participation in the Russian-Chinese War of 1900, and was also decorated by the Empire of Japan with the Order of the Rising Sun, 2nd class. He served as chief of staff to Viceroy, Yevgeny Alekseyev, from 1900‚Äì1903. After the outbreak of the Russo- Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905, Vitgeft became chief of the Naval Headquarters in the Far East. Following the death of Admiral Stepan Makarov, Vitgeft was appointed temporary commander of the \\"First Pacific Squadron\\", that portion of the Russian Pacific Fleet trapped at Port Arthur by the Japanese blockade. Vitgeft made one aborted attempt to break out of Port Arthur on 23 June. On 7 August, he suffered from a leg wound caused by a shell splinter during the Japanese bombardment of Port Arthur.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 410. Viceroy Alekseyev, an admiral, favored an aggressive sortie so as to enable the First Pacific Squadron to link up with the Vladivostok Squadron and thereby create a naval force powerful enough to challenge the Japanese fleet. Vitgeft believed \\"in a fleet in being\\",Forczyk p. 46 which simply stayed at anchor, while at the same time contributing some of his weaponry to the land battle as the safest course to follow. Although passive, Vitgeft's preference was actually more in keeping with the Russian Navy's doctrine, which was building up strength (waiting for the arrival of the Russian Baltic Fleet, renamed as the \\"2nd Pacific Squadron\\"), and then engaging the Japanese navy in decisive battle. Alekseyev appealed to St. Petersburg, and Tsar Nicholas II replied that he fully shared the Viceroy's opinion. Faced with an Imperial writ and threat of legal action, Admiral Vitgeft was ordered to sail for Vladivostok immediately.Forczyk p. 48 By 06:15 hours, on 10 August 1904, Admiral Vitgeft, flying his flag in the battleship Tsesarevich, began leading his fleet from the harbor. The Russian fleet consisted of the battleships , , , , , and Poltava, the protected cruisers , , and , and 14 destroyers. In the subsequent Battle of the Yellow Sea, the Imperial Japanese Navy's Combined Fleet under Admiral Togo Heihachiro intercepted the Russian fleet. At 18:40 on 10 August 1904, Admiral Vitgeft and his immediate staff were killed instantly when a salvo from the Japanese battleship struck the upper bridge of the Russian flagship Tsesarevich. The shell also jammed the flagship's steering into a shaft port turn, which threw the Russian line of battle into confusion. Five battleships, a cruiser and nine destroyers escaped back to Port Arthur; however, the damaged Tsesarevich and three escorting destroyers sailed to Kiaochou, where they were interned by German authorities.Forczyk p. 53, 54 Honors *link=Order of St. Anna Order of St. Anne 2nd degree 1893 *link=Order of St. Vladimir Order of St Vladimir 4th degree, 1893 . *link=Order of St. Vladimir Order of St Vladimir 3rd degree, 1898 . *link=Order of St. Stanislav Order of St. Stanislaus 1st degree with swords, 1900 *link=Order of the Redeemer Order of the Redeemer, 3rd degree, 1896 (Greece) *link=Order of the Rising Sun Order of the Rising Sun, 2nd degree, 1900 (Japan) *link=Order of St. Vladimir Order of the Crown, 2nd degree with star and swords, 1900 (Prussia) References * Forczyk, Robert.

Dvapara in Sanskrit literally means \\"two ahead\\", that is, something in the third place. The Dvapara Yuga follows the Treta Yuga and precedes the Kali Yuga. According to the Puranas, this yuga ended at the moment when Krishna returned to his eternal abode of Vaikuntha. According to the Bhagavata Purana, the Dvapara Yuga lasts 864,000 years or 2400 divine years. 12.2.29-33 There are only two pillars of religion during the Dvapara Yuga: compassion and truthfulness. Vishnu assumes the colour yellow and the Vedas are categorized into four parts: Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda and Atharva Veda. During these times, the Brahmins are knowledgeable of two or three of these but rarely have studied all the four Vedas thoroughly. Accordingly, because of this categorization, different actions and activities come into existence. The roles of the classes All people in the Dvapara Yuga are desirous of achievement of the scriptural dharma that is prescribed to each class, valiant, courageous and competitive by nature and are engaged only in penance and charity. They are kingly and pleasure-seeking. In this era, the divine intellect ceases to exist, and it is therefore seldom that anyone is wholly truthful. As a result of this life of deceit, people are plagued by ailments, diseases and various types of desires. After suffering from these ailments, people realize their misdeeds and perform penance. Some also organize Yagya for material benefits as well as for divinity. =Brahmana= In this Yuga, the Brahmanas are involved in Yagya, self-study and teaching activities. They attain celestial bliss by engaging in penance, religion, control of senses, and restraint. =Kshatriya= The duties of Kshatriyas are the protection of their subjects. In this era, they are humble and perform their duties by controlling their senses. The Kshatriyas honestly execute all policies of law and order without being angry or cruel. They are devoid of injustice towards the ordinary citizens and consequently attain bliss. The king avails the advice of the learned scholars and accordingly maintains law and order in his empire. The king who is addicted to vices will definitely end up defeated. That is why Yudhisthira never got defeated as he had no vices despite being only a Rathi and other kings being Atirathis and Maharathis, some Atimaharathis also. One or two or all from SƒÅma, DƒÅna, Danda, Bheda and Upeksha is/are brought into use and help attain the desired. Kings are diligent in maintaining public decorum and order. A few of the kings, however, surreptitiously plan a conspiracy along with the scholars. Strong people execute work where execution of policies is involved. The king appoints priests, etc. to perform religious activities, economists and ministers to perform monetary activities, impotents to take care of women, and cruel men to execute heinous activities. There are two kshatriya dynasties, namely 'Surya Vansha' and 'Chandra Vansha'. =Vaishya= Vaishyas are mostly landowners and merchants. The duties of Vaishyas are trade and agriculture. Vaishyas attain higher planes through charity and hospitality. =Shudra= The duty of Shudras is to perform tasks that demand highly physical work. Vedas says everyone is a born shudra and with their deeds, they can become a kshatriya, brahman, or vaishya. For political reasons Shudras had difficulty going up the ranks unless they were extraordinary. Vidura, the famous Prime Minister of Hastinapura was born in the Shudra community and attained the status of a Brahmin due to his wisdom, righteousness, and learning. In modern culture In 1894, Swami Sri Yukteswar, with his book The Holy Science, broke from Hindu tradition in stating that the Earth is not in the age of Kali Yuga, but has advanced to Dvapara Yuga. His proof was based on a new perspective of the precession of the equinoxes, correcting what he believed was an error in interpretation by the ancient sages. In Namco's Soul series, Kilik, the wielder of the Kali Yuga staff, also possess the mirror sash by the same name. In the end of the battle against Inferno, he uses the mirror to extinguish the flames. In Soulcalibur II, Soulcalibur III, and Soulcalibur IV he wears a necklace that includes a piece of the Dvapara Yuga used as a pendant for rituals.

It consists of approximately ten acres (40,000 m¬≤) of level ground on both sides of the River, the surrounding hillsides, and continues north along the eastern bank of the Sacramento River to the Dunsmuir City Park. The State of California and the City of Dunsmuir are creating a new park on this historic site. The Upper Soda Springs site contains a riparian ecosystem and includes its namesake mineral water springs. In large part because of its location on the Siskiyou Trail, the site mirrors the history of the state and of the American West.  Before the California Gold Rush  Before the California Gold Rush, the site had no permanent inhabitants. The nearest inhabitants, members of the Okwanuchu tribe, used the site as a temporary campground during the annual salmon fishing season. Another nearby tribe, the Wintu, likely did not have regular habitation sites this far north along the Sacramento. The first European or American visitors in the area were likely hunters and trappers, including Hudson's Bay Company hunting and trapping parties headed by Michel Laframboise, coming down from the Pacific Northwest during the 1820s-30s. As early as the 1830s, a pioneer cattle drive led by Ewing Young, along what was to become known as the Siskiyou Trail from Mexican-controlled California to settlements in Oregon, stopped at Upper Soda Springs. In 1841, an overland party of the United States Exploring Expedition with cartographers and botanists entered the upper Sacramento River canyon, and recorded visits to mineral springs sites on the upper Sacramento River, including passing through Upper Soda Springs.  During and after the Gold Rush  The discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in 1848, brought the Forty-Niners to California in search of riches during the California Gold Rush. For the next ten years, these prospectors spread from the original Gold Country region of the Sierra Nevada throughout the state. Discovery of gold near Yreka, California in 1851 greatly increased the traffic between California's Central Valley and Yreka, and north into Oregon and Washington. Packers with mule trains joined the prospectors heading north, following existing Native American foot trails through rugged mountains, including the Sacramento River canyon. A rustic wayside hostel for these travelers was the first permanent habitation on the site, established in the early 1850s. During this same time, a band of Wintu, fleeing the predation of the Forty-Niners on the Trinity River, crossed the mountains, and settled near the springs. In about 1855, a toll bridge crossing the Sacramento River was built on the site by pioneers Ross McCloud and Mary Campbell McCloud. During the next 30 years, the first stagecoach road between the Central Valley and Oregon passed through the site and a more substantial inn was developed, with a covered \\"springhouse\\" to allow the public to enjoy the \\"soda water\\" from the mineral springs (on the far right in the image to right.) Notably, the name \\"Dolly Varden trout\\" was first given to a colorful local fish species by Elda McCloud, the daughter of Ross and Mary McCloud. The arrival of the Central Pacific railroad in 1886 heralded still further expansion of the inn. Now known as the Upper Soda Springs Resort, it was a destination for well-to-do Victorian Era travelers who would come to \\"take the waters\\" at the mineral springs. With the increasing popularity of the automobile in the 20th century, vacation tastes changed, and the Resort closed by 1920. The property was subdivided, and became private residences and businesses.  Modern era  Beginning in the late 1990s, through public and private efforts, riverside parcels of the historic Upper Soda Springs Resort property were acquired and dedicated to park land. Sections of the site have been restored and further work is planned. Tauhindauli Park and Trail Tauhindauli Park and Trail has been developed along the beautiful Sacramento River canyon on the former site of Upper Soda Springs resort on the banks of the Sacramento River in Dunsmuir, California. It consists of approximately ten acres of level ground on the bank of the river, the surrounding hillsides, and continues north along the eastern bank of the Sacramento River to the Dunsmuir City Park in the heart of Dunsmuir. Long a favorite local fishing spot, swimming hole, and a site of both historical and ecological significance, this special place has finally received the attention it deserves and has been improved to enhance its recreational opportunities and esthetics. Environmental work and levee restructuring has been done which has improved flood control for the entire town. This is a river restoration project which has created a natural park with pathways which wind through native grasses and plants, no manicured lawns can be found. Walking trails, fishing access and picnic areas are available so the natural beauty of the Sacramento River can be enjoyed to the fullest. For ecological and flood purposes, riparian forests and meadows have been restored close to their original condition. Levees have been moved and built up for maximum protection for the Park from river erosion and to restore the watershed to the natural habitat which provides food for animals. The Park can be accessed from River Avenue. to the south and Stagecoach Road to Upper Soda Springs Road in the canyon. Tuahindauli Park and Trail is a project of the Dunsmuir Garden Club. Funding for this project comes principally from the Cantara Trustee Council and the Department of Fish and Game.

The collection is alternatively known as the Lydian Hoard. The items are exhibited in the U≈üak Museum of Archaeology. The collection made sensational news once again in May 2006 when a key piece, a golden hippocamp, on display in U≈üak Museum along with the rest of the collection, was discovered to have been switched with a fake, probably between March and August 2005, Yet another term used for the collection is \\"Croesus Treasure\\". Although the artifacts were closely contemporary to Croesus, whether they should be directly associated with the legendary Lydian king or not remains debatable. Croesus' wealth had repercussions on a number of Asian cultures in a vein similar to his fame in the western cultures, and is referred to either as Qarun (Arabic, Persian) or Karun (Turkish), or Korah, with the mythical proportions of his fortune also echoed in various ways, parallel to the English language expression \\"as rich as Croesus\\".Qarun and reference to his wealth mentioned in the Koran ([28:76] to [28:82]). In Persian mythology, to which the other citations could be connected, the Q√¢run Treasure is a treasure said to be in perpetual motion under the ground. The phrase harta karun (literally Croesus' Wealth) also worked into the Malay language as the word for treasure and is synonymous with the term buried treasure. Ganj-e-Qarun (Croesus Treasure) was also an Iranian movie made in 1965 by Siamak Yasami and widely regarded as one of the classics of Iranian cinema. The movie recounts the story of a very wealthy man who attempts suicide and then finds happiness in the simplicity of a pauper's home. This explains why the term \\"Karun Treasure\\" took hold, and in any case, the king Croesus' Treasure consisted of more than 363 pieces and the tomb chamber tumulus where most artifacts were discovered (they originate from close but different sites) was that of a woman. Discovery and smuggling The main and the most precious part of the treasure comes from a tomb chamber of a Lydian princess reached through illegal excavations carried out by three fortune-seekers from U≈üak's depending G√ºre village, at the proximity of which the tomb was located, at the locality called Toptepe. After having dug for days and unable to break through the marble masonry of the chamber door, they had dynamited the roof of the tomb in the night of 6 June 1966, to be the first to see the breathtaking sight of the buried Lydian noblewoman and her treasures after 2600 years. The treasure looted from this particular tomb was enriched by further finds by the same men in other tumuli of the locality during 1966-1967. The collection was smuggled outside Turkey in separate dispatches through ƒ∞zmir and Amsterdam, to be bought by the Metropolitan Museum of Art between 1967‚Äì1968, at an invoiced cost of $1.2 million for 200 of the pieces within the collection. Legal battle The efforts made by successive Turkish governments to retrieve the collection were incited since the very beginning and followed until conclusion by the journalist √ñzgen Acar. Acar had chanced upon some pieces of the collection for the first time in 1984 in a Met Museum catalogue and had informed Turkey's Ministry of Culture of their clear provenance, while he also wrote several articles and pursued the bureaucratic channels within Turkey with insistence throughout the affair. He acted as a voluntary envoy of the Ministry within the frame of the judicial case launched in New York City in 1987 and brought to conclusion in 1993, at the same time as he was named consultant in the larger framework of the Turkey's participation in the work carried out by UNIDROIT regarding the protection of historic, cultural and religious heritage. Acar's name is also synonymous in Turkey for the retrieval of another set of smuggled archaeological goods, termed \\"Elmalƒ± Treasure\\" in reference to their site of origin, the town of Elmalƒ± in southwestern Turkey, and involving this time Lydian coins and extremely rare decadrachms dating from the period of the Delian League, with the Boston Museum of Fine Arts as his opposite party. U≈üak Museum case The clear need for a museum worthy of the treasure was being voiced ever since the artifacts had returned to Turkey. With the seizure by the authorities of ten other illegally excavated artifacts in 1998, further archaeological discoveries and the known presence of eight gold pieces that had appeared in 2000 during an exhibition in a Paris private gallery for which attempts for retrieval were yet to be made, a handsome collection of base consisting of a total of 375 pieces was already accumulated. But the small museum in U≈üak where the collection was placed, more focused on storage of Ushak carpets and operating under conditions of budgetary and staff restraints,The number of experts working in Turkish museums halved from 1,500 to 750 in the last ten years. did not fully meet the requirements for the preservation of Karun Treasure. Doubts about the site's suitability were reinforced by the filing of currently unresolved legal action against museum staff regarding the 2007 theft. The museum's former director remains the only person to be still kept in custody among the ten initially accused in the frame of the case around the hippocamp's replacement with a fake. Curse of the treasure Some in U≈üak and beyond associate the treasure with a curse. Legend has it that the seven men who took part in the illegal digs \\"died violent deaths or suffered great misfortune\\".

Earnings guidance is usually a financial forecast presented as a quarterly report of the corporation's performance in the next quarter. Guidance is an aid to financial analysts and the stock market in valuing the corporation, and helps prevent overvaluation. According to Investopedia, Guidance refers to Information that a company provides as an indication or estimate of its future earnings. Guidance reports estimating a company's future earnings have some influence over analyst stock ratings and investor decisions to buy, hold, or sell the security. In the United States, a quarterly revenue forecast, or quarterly guidance, by publicly traded companies had become by the 2000s both a common practice (75% of American firms in 2003) and a major influence on the firm's share price. By the 2010s, the quarterly guidance practice had fallen out of favor among many companies (27% of firms continued the practice in 2017) as it was seen as emphasizing a focus on short-term performance. By contrast, public Eurozone companies rarely (1%) issued quarterly guidance in the 2010s.

As a player, he was a striker from 1987 to 2004. Wallace was born in Lewisham but started his football career at Southampton in 1987 playing 128 league games scoring 45 goals. This form earned him a transfer to Leeds United where he won the First Division championship. After spending seven years at Leeds, Dick Advocaat signed him on a Bosman ruling transfer for Rangers where he scored 41 league goals and was part of the squad that won five out of six trophies in their first two seasons. After leaving Rangers in 2001 he signed for Bolton Wanderers on a free transfer for a season and then Gillingham before retiring from professional football. Playing career =Southampton= He signed for the Saints as an apprentice in 1986 along with his twin brother Ray Wallace. Elder brother Danny Wallace had already become an established member of the Southampton first team. On 22 October 1988, his two brothers Danny and Ray lined up alongside him in the Southampton team in a match at The Dell against Sheffield Wednesday; this was the first time three brothers had played in the same team in English professional top-flight football. In his best season at Southampton, 1989-90, he scored 21 goals in all competitions. The previous season also saw his goal tally go well into double figures, as did the season after, as he formed an exciting young strikeforce with Alan Shearer and Matthew Le Tissier, which soon attracted interest from a number of bigger clubs. The following year he played against Bulgaria, Republic of Ireland and United States for the England under-21 team. =Leeds United= Fellow top-flight team Leeds United signed him for ¬£1.6 million in the summer of 1991, and he helped them win the old First Division championship and Charity Shield competition a year later. He became an integral part of the Leeds squad for the next seven years and was found often playing as an out-and-out striker or in a more wide position on the flanks. In September 1992, Wallace was called up to the senior England squad for a friendly against Spain, but had to pull out because of injury. He was never called up for international duty again. He scored a hat-trick for Leeds on the last day of the 1992‚Äì93 season in a 3‚Äì3 draw at Coventry City. Wallace won the 1993‚Äì94 Goal of the Season competition with a mazy dribble against Tottenham Hotspur in a Premier League game on 17 April 1994. His brother, Danny, had won the same award 10 seasons earlier, making them the first and, to date, only brothers to gain the accolade. Leeds finished fifth at the end of that season, repeating this finish in 1995 and 1998. Wallace's contract with the Elland Road club was due to expire in the summer of 1998 and this resulted in a Bosman transfer move to Scotland to join Rangers. =Rangers= Whilst North of the Border the speedy Londoner acquired a flurry of medals to add to the silverware previously won during his time in England. In his first season, he won the domestic treble, finishing as top scorer with 27 goals and scoring the winning goal in the 1999 Scottish cup final win over Celtic, the first cup final to be played at the fully renovated Hampden Park. The following season he was part of the squad that won the league and cup double. In total he made 122 appearances and scored 56 goals. =Bolton Wanderers= In 2001, he headed back to English football on a free transfer to link up with newly promoted Bolton Wanderers of the Premier League. He scored on his d√©but away to Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park and managed to net further goals against Tottenham and Blackburn again. He also scored once in the League Cup against Nottingham Forest. Wallace successfully helped Bolton stave off relegation, but was on the move again after rejecting new one-year contract remain at the club.https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/5963376.wallace-for-the-gills/ =Gillingham= In June 2002 he joined Gillingham on a two-year contract and managed to score 12 goals in his first full season at the Priestfield Stadium. His time with the Gills was blighted by a succession of injuries and at the end of the 2003‚Äì04 season he announced his retirement from professional football. The summer of 2004 saw him return to Southampton in a one-off benefit game organised for elder brother Danny who has been diagnosed with the condition Multiple sclerosis. Coaching career In January 2008, he was appointed as assistant manager of Kingstonian's under 18 side, before joining Molesey for season 2010‚Äì11. Wallace joined Epsom & Ewell as a reserve team coach in October 2011.

The term is used mainly in Malaysia and parts of Sumatra, whereas most Indonesians use the word dukun. It is often mistranslated into English as medicine man or witch doctor. In colloquial usage, the term bomoh is often interchangeable with another type of shaman, the pawang, but they generally serve different functions. The bomoh is primarily a healer, herbalist, geomancer, and sorcerer. The pawang on the other hand usually specialises in rituals involving weather, nature, animals, and a good harvest. Their roles do overlap however, and both act as an intermediary for the spirits and gods. Etymology The word bomoh (at times spelled bomo or bomor) has been in common usage since at least classical times. It is a cognate of the Thai term maw or mohr (; , \\"doctor\\"). This word can mean either doctor or a sorcerer, as in terms like mawpii (; , \\"spirit doctor\\") and mawduu (; , \\"fortune-teller\\"). Prior to the later introduction of the English-derived \\"doktor\\" or the Arabic word \\"tabib\\", the bomoh served as healers and physicians in Malay society. Thai shamans or bomoh Siam are traditionally held in high regard in Malaysia. Malay texts such as the Hikayat Aceh (1600-1625) record the word bomoh simply as mo or moh.Hikayat Aceh ::Hikayat Aceh 127:7 \\"... gajah tuanku ini. Diperhamba suruh ubati kepada [bo]mo gajah tuanku. Berilah makanannya.\\" ::Hikayat Aceh 127:7 \\"... this king's elephant. The king asked it to be treated by the elephant [bo]moh. Give it food.\\" Background Shamanism in Southeast Asia can be traced to the region's prehistoric tribal people. The bomoh's original role was that of a healer and their expertise was first and foremost an in-depth knowledge of medicinal herbs and tajul muluk or Malay geomancy. This was supplemented by Sanskrit mantera (mantra) owing to the ancient Hindu-Buddhist influence in the region. Before European colonisation, bomoh - along with Buddhist monks and Hindu holymen - were often exempt from paying taxes, due to the fact that many of them had few material belongings. =Modern era= The bomoh's craft remained largely unchanged even after Islam became dominant until the Islamic revival in the 1970s and 80s. Bomoh were then seen as deviant from the Muslim faith because of their invocation of spirits and the potentially harmful black magic they were accused of practicing. This period saw a drastic decline in traditional herbalism and many fraudulent practitioners filled the void. As a result, bomoh are today looked at with suspicion even though they are still commonly consulted for personal reasons. Many bomoh today have tried to adapt their practice in the context of modern Islam, such as reciting verses of the Quran or invoking the names of Allah, but this is viewed as shallow by conservative shamans. Cosmology and function Malay metaphysical theory holds that the body, and in fact the universe itself, is made up of the four classical elements of fire, water, earth, and wind. Illnesses are often said to be caused by an imbalance of these elements. To restore this balance, patients are advised to bathe in cool water to which lime juice is added. The bomoh also works with rituals and incantations, called jampi.A Dictionary of Malayan Medicine, =Spirits= Some bomoh use cemeteries to summon spirits to fulfill requests by supplicants, while others only deal with a single spirit. It is said that sometimes the bomoh selects the spirit, while other times, it is the spirit who selects the bomoh. Spirits are said to be able to heal the sick, seek missing persons or even investigate reasons for bad luck. Spirits can also be used to attack people, cause sickness and misery and many other bad things. Bomoh who have a particular religion may incorporate their religious practices into their craft. Traditionally, healing rituals of some bomoh involved music and dance, such as the main puteri or main peteri (a trance-dance from Kelantan and Terengganu often connected to mak yong), the main lukah (a fisherman's dance from Pahang), and the main saba (which re-enacts the heavenly princesses [puteri kayangan] dancing around a saba tree). The music is played by an assistant called the tuk minduk. In popular culture = The bomoh of the flight MH370 = In 2014, shortly after the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Dato Mahaguru Ibrahim Mat Zin, who proclaimed himself as the Raja Bomoh (King of Bomoh) with his male assistant, appeared in public offering to locate the missing plane by conducting a series of rituals at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The ritual involved using a pair of bamboo binoculars to view the inside of a traditional fish trap. Ibrahim claimed that the plane was suspended in the air amongst three locations which were the Philippines, South China Sea and on an unidentified country and it was hidden by the orang-orang bunian (\\"the Bunian\\", a supernatural race resembling humans, akin to elves in Malay legend). Beside the ritual, Ibrahim Mat Zin also stated that 100,000 seni gayong martial artists had performed prayers for the missing plane and its passengers. A few days later he and his four assistants, three males and one female came to KLIA, bringing along a water gourd, holy Zamzam water from Mecca, a small surat Ya Sin book and several other items to conduct another ritual. This time, Ibrahim Mat Zin used two coconuts and knocked them against each other with his two bare hands while shouting takbir. Then, his three male assistants sat on the \\"magic carpet\\" and using a number of \\"magical artifacts\\" such as a walking stick, a basket and two coconuts, and thus started the infamous scene, while local and international photographers took a few shots. Ibrahim Mat Zin claimed that the purpose of the ritual is to weaken the spirits' hold on the plane. The incidents drew international attention, eventually becoming the subject of an online game application called Bomoh: Rescue Run developed by a company named Triapps, which surpassed more than 100,000 downloads in Google Play. Minister for Youth and Sports Khairy Jamaluddin, who was not amused by the activities of the bomoh, tweeted in regards to the incident: \\"Somebody should arrest those magic carpet bomohs. Memalukan (humiliating)\\". He even resorted to contacting Jamil Khir, the Minister for Islamic Affairs, to deal with the bomoh. Meanwhile, the Malaysian Department of Islamic Advancement had issued a fatwa that Ibrahim Mat Zin's methods contradict Islamic teachings. Some netizens had also pointed out the similarities of the antics of the bomoh with a scene in the P. Ramlee movie Laksamana Do Re Mi where the main characters ride on a flying mat, while the bamboo binoculars session once held by Ibrahim Mat Zin to locate the missing plane mimic Re's magic single vision binocular in the movie. = Strained relations between Malaysia and North Korea = In 2017, the very same Bomoh from the flight MH370 ritual conducted a ritual in what he perceived to protect Malaysia from North Korea in wake of the strained tensions between the two nations.

During the Korean War, he lost both his father and his wife.* , p. 95 In 1957, he went to the United States and attended Fuller Theological Seminary where he met Dr. Bill Bright, the founder of Campus Crusade for Christ International. In 1958, with collaboration and support from Bright, Kim established Korea Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2004, with much fanfare, Kim retired and appointed Sung Min Park as his successor. Kim was also a famous Korean Christian Evangelist. The story goes that during the springtime, as Kim's family was enjoying the day, an angry band of communist guerrillas invaded the village where Kim lived, killing everyone, including Kim's family. The guerrillas killed Kim's wife and father. Kim was beaten and left for dead. Late, he awoke and fled to the safety of the mountains with his young daughter, Unhi Kim. Kim learned from Scriptures to love his enemies and pray for those who persecuted him. The Spirit of God impressed upon him that he was to return to the village, seek out the communist leader who had led the attack and tell the communist leader, who killed Kim's wife and father, that he loved and forgave the communist leader, and to speak to the communist leader of God's love through Christ. This eventually happened, and the communist leader ended up kneeling in prayer with Kim and gave his life to Christ. Within a short time, a number of other communists were converted to Christ and Kim helped build a church for these and other new Christians. Kim later became the pastor of one of the largest churches in South Korea, and founder of Korea Campus Crusade for Christ. Death and legacy On September 29, 2009 he died at the age of 85.

He was a self-confident insurance man and an officer in the National Guard. A charter member and the 1924 President of the Atlanta Junior Chamber of Commerce, he served as president of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce starting in 1932 and ran for mayor in 1934, but was soundly defeated by James L.

This caused Hartsfield to start the campaign to annex Buckhead but in September 1941, LeCraw defeated Hartsfield by 111 votes. His tenure was to be short-lived, however. He joined the Army, resigning his post in May 1942 when mayor pro tem George B. Lyle took over until a special election could be held on May 27, in which Hartsfield defeated eight opponents. LeCraw served in Europe and after the war he returned and ran again in 1945 but was defeated by Hartsfield. In 1948, he served as a state senator, and in 1954 lost a bid for the U.S. Congress.

The route runs from MD 662 in Wye Mills, Queen Anne's County north to the Pennsylvania border in Cecil County, where the road continues into that state as Pennsylvania Route 841 (PA 841). The route, which is a two-lane undivided highway most of its length, passes through mostly rural areas as well as the towns of Centreville, Chestertown, Galena, Cecilton, Chesapeake City, and Elkton. MD 213 intersects many routes including U.S. Route 50 (US 50) near Wye Mills, US 301 near Centreville, and US 40 in Elkton. It crosses over the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal in Chesapeake City on the Chesapeake City Bridge. MD 213 is designated by the state as the Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway between the southern terminus and Chesapeake City with the portion north of MD 18 in Centreville a National Scenic Byway. In addition, the route is also considered part of the Atlantic to Appalachians Scenic Byway between Chesapeake City and MD 273 in Fair Hill. The route was initially designated as US 213 in 1926 when the U.S. Highway System was established, running from Ocean City west and north to US 40 in Elkton. The highway was rerouted to cross the Nanticoke River in Vienna by 1933, with the former route between Mardela Springs and Eldorado becoming a part of MD 313 and the alignment between Eldorado and Rhodesdale becoming part of MD 14. US 213 was rerouted to use the Emerson C. Harrington Bridge over the Choptank River in Cambridge in 1939; the former alignment between Vienna and Easton became MD 331\\\\. Meanwhile, the road between Elkton and the Pennsylvania border became MD 280\\\\. US 213 was moved to a bypass of Easton and straight alignment between Easton and Wye Mills in 1948. A year later, the southern terminus was cut back to US 50 in Wye Mills, with an extended US 50 replacing US 213 between Wye Mills and Ocean City. In 1971, US 213 and MD 280 were decommissioned and replaced with MD 213\\\\. Route description MD 213 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial within the town of Elkton. =Queen Anne's County= View north at the south end of MD 213 at MD 662 in Wye Mills MD 213 begins at an intersection with MD 662 (Wye Mills Road) in Wye Mills, Queen Anne's County, heading to the north on College Drive, a two-lane undivided road.

Here, the road continues north as PA 841 into Lewisville, intersecting the southern terminus of PA 472 just north of the state line. History In 1911, what would become US 213 was completed as a state highway between Hebron and Riverton via Mardela Springs, Easton and Longwoods, Centerville and Church Hill, and in the Chestertown area, while the present road between Elkton and Singerly was also built as a state highway. The portion of roads between Riverton and Sharptown, Brookview and Hurlock, Church Hill and southeast of Chestertown, northeast of Chestertown and northeast of Kennedyville, and Chesapeake City and Elkton were under contract to be built as state roads. At this time, a state highway was proposed along the segments between Ocean City and Berlin, Salisbury and Hebron, Sharptown and Brookview, Hurlock and Easton, Longwoods and Centreville, northeast of Kennedyville and Chesapeake City, and Elkton and Fair Hill. By 1915, the entire length of road between Ocean City and Elkton was completed as a state highway. The state highway between Singerly and south of Fair Hill was finished by 1923. The state highway was finished to Fair Hill by 1927. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System on November 11, 1926, US 213 was designated to run from the Atlantic Ocean in Ocean City west and north to US 40 in Elkton. The route headed west from Ocean City through Berlin and Salisbury (where it intersected its parent route US 13), before it turned northwest to Mardela Springs. Here, US 213 turned to the north and ran to Eldorado, where it continued northwest through Hurlock and Preston to Easton. From Easton, the route continued north to Wye Mills and followed the present alignment of MD 213 to Elkton. A new Dover Bridge over the Choptank River east of Easton, replacing a bridge built in the 19th century, was completed in 1932. By 1933, US 213 was rerouted to cross the Nanticoke River at Vienna instead of at Sharptown. The route headed west from Mardela Springs to Vienna, where it turned north to Rhodesdale. The former alignment of US 213 became a southern extension of MD 313 between Mardela Springs and Eldorado and an eastern extension of MD 14 between Rhodesdale and Eldorado. In 1939, US 213 was realigned to cross the Choptank River at Cambridge on the Emerson C. Harrington Bridge that opened in 1935. The route replaced MD 344 between Vienna and Mount Holly, ran concurrent with MD 16 between Mount Holly and Cambridge, and turned north across the river to continue to Easton. The former routing of US 213 between Vienna and Easton became MD 331. In 1939, the road between US 40 and the northern terminus of US 213 in Elkton and the Pennsylvania border north of Fair Hill was designated MD 280. The portion of MD 280 between Fair Hill and the Pennsylvania border was built as a state highway by 1933. On July 28, 1942, the vertical lift bridge carrying US 213 over the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal, built in 1927, was destroyed when the tanker Franz Klasen struck it. The destroyed bridge was replaced by the current Chesapeake City Bridge, which opened in 1949. The approaches to the original bridge are now designated as MD 537 and a western extension of MD 285. US 213 was relocated to a new divided highway alignment to the north between Herring Creek in West Ocean City and Ocean City in 1942, including a new bridge across Sinepuxent Bay into Ocean City (the current Harry W. Kelley Memorial Bridge). The bypassed portion of US 213 remained a state highway and was designated MD 707 by 1948. A portion of US 213 south of Easton was moved to a straight alignment by 1946; the former routing became MD 565\\\\. By 1946, work was underway for a bypass to the east of Easton along with a straight alignment between Easton and Wye Mills. US 213 was moved to this new alignment in 1948, with the former alignment on Washington Street in Easton becoming an extended MD 333 in the southern part of the city and an extended MD 33 in the northern part the city, while MD 662 was designated on the original alignment between Easton and Wye Mills. In 1949, US 50 was extended from Annapolis across the Chesapeake Bay, first via a ferry run by the Maryland State Roads Commission, then over the original span of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge when it was completed in the middle of 1952, all the way to Ocean City. The southern terminus of US 213 was cut back to US 50 in Wye Mills, with the former route of US 213 between Wye Mills and Ocean City becoming part of the newly extended US 50\\\\. The former routing of US 213 between Wye Mills and Ocean City is now US 50 between Wye Mills and Vienna, Old Route 50 through Vienna, US 50 between Vienna and Salisbury, US 50 Bus. through Salisbury, MD 346 between Salisbury and east of Berlin, and US 50 between east of Berlin and Ocean City. On December 3, 1971, the American Association of State Highway Officials approved the elimination of the US 213 designation. US 213 along with MD 280 were replaced by MD 213, which ran from MD 662 in Wye Mills north to the Pennsylvania border north of Fair Hill. In 1994, the at-grade intersection with US 301 was replaced with an interchange.

The legal drama starred Rob Lowe as a lawyer named Jack Turner, newly appointed as partner of a long-established law firm that, as the plot revealed, harbored some dark secrets; the series' title and firm's name are allusions to the surname of Lowe, who also served as executive producer. Much of the plot centered on the firm's internal politics and on Turner's attempts to uncover information on some of the firm's conspiracies while acting as the defense for some of the firm's higher-profile clients in a different case each episode. The cast, headed by Lowe, also included Matt Craven, Elizabeth Mitchell, Kyle Chandler, Frances Fisher, and David Krumholtz. The series premiered on the American television network NBC on September 28, 2003, but although thirteen episodes were ordered and produced, only six aired before NBC cancelled the series on November 30, 2003, due to poor ratings. When the UK's channel Five bought the UK terrestrial TV rights to the series in 2004, it aired all thirteen episodes. Years later, Rob Lowe later stated that after finding about the show's cancellation he and the show's producers decided to make the last episodes - which they were contractually obligated to make - as absurd as possible, including an \\"off the wall\\" and freakish ending.

However, when she arrived on set there was no chemistry between the two and Jewel brought her then-boyfriend, rodeo star Ty Murray, to the set with her on the day the actors were to film a love scene. According to Lowe, Jewel appeared uncomfortable at having to kiss Lowe, and unsuccessfully asked if the scene could be removed. Finally relenting by stating, \\"Let's just do this\\", Lowe said Jewel agreed to do the scene. Lowe stated: \\"But as we approached the kissing moment it became strained and it's never good when you can't trust that your fellow actor is on the same page... I pecked her on the lips; her mouth scrunched closed like you would do if someone was going to stick something unwanted into it, which I was not intending. I sort of moved my head from side to side to make it look real, like there was at least a dollop of energy or passion. 'Cut', said the director.

The program is currently the only science show on primetime television in Australia. Launched in 2001, it replaced Quantum which had ceased the previous year. Catalyst is regularly broadcast on ABC TV at 8:30 pm on Tuesdays and repeated at 6:00 pm on Sundays. Overview The show broadcasts stories on scientific themes, and in particular significant recent developments and discoveries. It focuses primarily on stories relevant to Australia, but the series covers international developments as well. It attempts to convey information in a way that is not only accurate but also interesting and informative to the general population, often discussing the ethical, political and other implications of scientific discoveries and research as well as the discoveries themselves. The show's website describes it as follows:\\"At Catalyst we know that science is a dynamic force for change\\", ABC website. Prime examples of Catalyst featured segments include \\"Corporate Psychopaths\\", \\"The Truth About Vitamins\\", and \\"Smell and Schizophrenia\\". The show originally was broadcast in a 30-minute format. Following a series of controversies and an internal review of the program, the ABC announced in November 2016 that Catalyst would shift to a 60-minute format starting in 2017. The new format utilises out-of-house experts in their respective fields, presenting 60-minute in depth documentaries. Episodes have included \\"The Great Australian Bee Challenge\\", \\"Bionic Revolution\\", \\"Feeding Australia\\" and \\"The Secret To Making Better Decisions\\". Staff The Catalyst team is composed of specialised science journalists, science communicators and producers, each with different specialisations and roles. Over Catalyst's history, the staff has included: =Presenters and reporters= *Maryanne Demasi, science journalist, medical research scientist *Alan Duffy, astronomer *Tim Flannery, palaeontologist and environmental activist *Joanna McMillan, dietitian *Derek Muller, physicist *Shalin Naik, stem cell biologist *Jonica Newby, veterinarian *Jordan Nguyen, biomedical engineer *Graham Phillips, astrophysicist *Lily Serna, mathematician *Nikki Stamp, cardiothoracic and transplant surgeon *Brad McKay, GP *Anja Taylor *Paul West, former chef and farmer *Caroline West, GP *Sarah McKay, neuroscientist. = Researchers = * Dominique Pile * Amy Sherden * Ariane Hall * Claire Smith Controversy A series of episodes (\\"Heart of the Matter\\", parts 1 and 2) broadcast in October 2013 which questioned the link between saturated fat, cholesterol and heart disease, as well as the widespread use of anti-cholesterol drugs known as statins, came under criticism from doctors and the National Heart Foundation of Australia. The foundation estimates that in the wake of those episodes up to 55,000 patients may have stopped taking their medication, leading to a potential increase in heart attacks and strokes over the next five years. In May 2014 the ABC removed both episodes from its website, after an internal review found that the second episode (but not the first) involved one breach of ABC standards on impartiality and there was a problem of omission of important information. \\"Wi-Fried?\\", an episode broadcast in February 2016 featuring American epidemiologist Devra Davis, courted further controversy by claiming that electromagnetic radiation emitted by devices such as mobile phones lead to an increased risk of brain cancer in heavy users, contrary to the mainstream view that exposure to such emissions is largely safe. The show faced criticism from local experts, viewers and scientists disputing the episode's claims, with public health professor Simon Chapman stating that \\"this is not the first time Catalyst have aired a questionable episode, and there really needs to be a review of their editorial process\\". An investigation by the ABC's independent Audience and Consumer Affairs Unit found that the episode breached editorial policies standards on accuracy and impartiality, later leading to the withdrawal of the episode from the ABC website. The controversy led to the temporary suspension of reporter Dr. Maryanne Demasi from the show and is the second time since Heart of the Matter, Parts 1 and 2 to have breached editorial standards. It also led to the ABC reviewing the future strategy and direction of the program, leading to format changes for the following series.

Biography =Early years= James L. Key was born in Dekalb County, Georgia on July 27, 1867, and educated in the public schools. He initially took up the practice of law in the city of Atlanta, in the 1890s =Political career= By 1902, Key was an Atlanta city councilman representing the Sixth Ward. He ran for mayor in 1904 and 1918 first losing to, then defeating, James G. Woodward. He was easily re-elected in the 1920 election. During that second term, he established Atlanta's first City Planning Commission and issued bonds to build the Spring St. viaduct (completed December 20, 1923). He didn't run for re-election in 1922, and when he did run in 1924, he lost. In 1930, Key was elected to a third Term in the wake of the Atlanta graft ring scandal and early in that term he made public statements against Prohibition and the blue law bans of Sunday baseball games and Sunday movies. This precipitated a recall vote in 1932 that he would have lost if not for support from the black community. He was instrumental in getting Harry Hopkins and his WPA program to update the city sewer system and nearly a million dollars to remodel the Atlanta Municipal Auditorium and Cyclorama building. Key won a fourth term in 1934. Herbert T. Jenkins,Sr. who named a son after the mayor, was an aide and driver for Key. Jenkins later served as Chief of Police of the Atlanta Police Department for 26 years, from 1947-1973. By the time he was campaigning for his fifth term, against William B. Hartsfield in 1936, the nearly 70-year-old Key was accused of spending only an hour a day at his office and lost a contentious race. Death and legacy James L. Key died in 1939 after finally seeing the end of Prohibition. The James L. Key Elementary School was named for the late mayor in 1963. Located at the intersection of Memorial Drive and Stovall Street, the school was closed in the 1990s. The former James L. Key Golf Course, in Atlanta, was named in his honor. The golf course, along with many old Victorian-era homes in the Grant Park neighborhood were demolished in the late 1950s to make way for Interstate 20. References External links * Image: James L.

His major promotion came in 1971 when he began his decade as professor of English literature at Sheffield University, in succession to William Empson. From 1964 to 1986, he was general editor of the New Mermaid dramatists, and from 1974 to 1982 of the New Arden Shakespeare. He also edited the poems of Cleveland and the plays of John Ford, while using his acquired administrative skills on the board of the National Portrait Gallery. These skills were fully tested when, in 1980, he was named principal of what was then St David's University College, the smallest and most endangered part of the University of Wales. Retaining a home in Derbyshire, he saw his Lampeter appointment as an opportunity to get back in touch with his roots. In addition to literary criticism such as his study of Harri Webb (1993) for the University of Wales Press in the \\"Writers of Wales\\" series, his publications included several poetry collections, including Tide- Race (1976), Dear Tokens (1987) and The Waters of Comfort (1998). His collected poems were published in the year of his death by Rare Books & Berry Ltd. In 1990, Morris was made a life peer with the title Baron Morris of Castle Morris, of St Dogmaels in the County of Dyfed, expanding his name ‚Äì to distinguish it from an earlier Baron Morris ‚Äì by adding \\"of Castle Morris\\", a small and largely insignificant hamlet between Fishguard and St David's and actually spelt Castlemorris. He justified his appointment to the unelected body by pointing out \\"Manchester United football team isn't chosen by popular vote\\". A brilliant and respected speech writer, his speeches in the house were sprinkled with quotations from Shakespeare, Goldsmith, Juvenal and Alexander Pope. When Morris reminded the Tories of the saying \\"Whom God wishes to destroy, he first sends mad,\\" he used the original Latin. Morris never forgot his Welsh roots, and was a nationalist sympathiser. Whilst he never was a fluent speaker of the Welsh language, he fought for its legal status in the nation.Telegraph newspaper obituary Later in his political career, Morris was marginalised within the Labour Party for being too 'Old Labour' by supporters of the new party leader Tony Blair. Prior to Labour's 1997 election win, a fellow Labour politician, Bernard Donoughue, commented in his diary that Morris was among the academics who \\"have never operated on the national stage and are desperately keen to get there\\". Morris died aged 70 from leukaemia in 2001.

Biography Habibi was born in Haifa on 29 August 1922, into an Anglican Palestinian Arab family. His family had originally belonged to the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem but converted to Anglicanism due to disputes within the Orthodox church. In his early life, he worked on an oil refinery and later was a radio announcer. Under the Mandate he became one of the leaders of the Palestine Communist Party. When the 1948 Arab-Israeli War began, he remained in Haifa and became an Israeli citizen. After the war, he helped to create the Communist Party of Israel and established the communist paper Al-Ittihad. In 1956, he moved from Haifa to Nazareth and remained there for the rest of his life. He died in 1996 in Nazareth, but in his will, he expressed his wish to be buried in his beloved home, Haifa. His will also asked that his tombstone include the phrase \\"remained in Haifa.\\"January 2017 Political career Habibi was one of the leaders of the Palestine Communist Party during the Mandate era. He supported the 1947 UN Partition Plan. When Israel became a state he helped form the Israeli Communist Party (Maki). He served in the Knesset between 1951 and 1959, and again from 1961 until 1972, first as a member of Maki, before breaking away from the party with Tawfik Toubi and Meir Vilner to found Rakah. In 1991, after a conflict about how the party should deal with the new policies of Mikhail Gorbachev, he left the party. Journalism and literary writings \\"Habibi became one of the most popular authors in the Middle East as a result of works depicting the conflicts in loyalties experienced by Palestinians living as an Arab minority in the Jewish state of Israel. In such works as Strange Events in the Disappearance of Said Abu al-Nahs al-Mutashael (1974), the most notable of his seven novels, he explored the duality of those Arabs who, like himself, did not leave their homeland during the 1948-49 Arab- Israeli war.\\"January 2017 Habibi began writing short stories in the 1950s, and his first story, The Mandelbaum Gate was published in 1954, though he did not resume literary writing until the late 1960s. In 1972 he resigned from the Knesset in order to write his first novel: The Secret Life of Saeed the Pessoptimist, which became a classic in modern Arabic literature. The book depicts the life of a Palestinian, employing black humour and satire. It was based on the traditional anti-hero Said in Arab literature. In a playful way it deals with how it is for Arabs to live in the state of Israel, and how one who has nothing to do with politics is drawn into it. He followed this by other books, short stories and a play. His last novel, published in 1992, was Saraya, the Ogre's Daughter. In it he has a character state: > \\"There is no difference between Christian and Muslim: we are all Palestinian > in our predicament\\"Imƒ´l ·∏§abƒ´bƒ´,Saraya, the Ogre's Daughter: A Palestinian > Fairy Tale, Ibis Editions, 2006 p.169. Literary prizes In 1990, Habibi received the Al-Quds Prize from the PLO. In 1992, he received the Israel Prize for Arabic literature.New York Times 7 May 1992 Jerusalem Journal; To a Novelist of Nazareth, Laurels and Loud Boos by Joel Greenberg His willingness to accept both reflected his belief in coexistence, though his acceptance of the Israel Prize set off a debate among the Arabic intellectual community. Habibi was accused of legitimizing what they considered Israel's \\"anti-Arab\\" policy. Habibi replied to the accusations: \\"A dialogue of prizes is better than a dialogue of stones and bullets,\\" he said. \\"It is indirect recognition of the Arabs in Israel as a nation. This is recognition of a national culture. It will help the Arab population in its struggle to strike roots in the land and win equal rights\\".

It was the first overseas mission post for Campus Crusade for Christ, founded by Dr. Bill Bright in 1951. Since its inception in 1958, Korea Campus Crusade for Christ (KCCC) has field offices both domestically and internationally spreading over countries from Asia to the Americas, including the United States. Its main focus is on world evangelism and discipleship. Korea Campus Crusade for Christ became the first overseas mission post for Campus Crusade for Christ under the tutelage of Dr. Bill Bright. KCCC ministry began in the southwestern city of Gwangjoo and quickly spread to other parts of Korea including Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Daejun, and Jeonju. Currently, KCCC headquarters is located at Buam-dong with 50 domestic mission posts and 15 international mission posts with over 1,000 missionaries abroad. After half a century as the head of KCCC, founder Dr. Joon Gon Kim retired his post and Reverend Sung Min Park was chosen to succeed him. Name Change On March 11, 2016, KCCC in the United States officially announced that it would be changing its name to 'SOON Movement.' Both names would be continued to be used together as they ultimately transition to their new name. 'Soon' is a Korean term that appears in the Korean translation of Isaiah 53:2, which describes Jesus as one who \\"grew up before him like a tender shoot\\"The New International Version (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2011), Is 53:2. ('soon is 'shoot' in Korean). Additionally, KCCC's small groups are called 'soons,' in which 'soon wons' (small group members) are discipled by 'soon jangs' (small group leaders). Using the word 'soon,' as part of the ministry's new name reflects the importance of discipleship in their movement.http://www.christianitydaily.com/articles/7798/20160316/korea-campus- crusade-christ-changes-name-soon-movement.htm Los Angeles Although there were efforts to expand Korea Campus Crusade for Christ, Los Angeles, in the 80's and 90's, it was not until 1996 when Rev. Dong Whan Kim revitalized the organization and propelled it into one of the largest interdenominational Korean mission organizations in Southern California. One of its prime ministries is the campus ministry that covers some of the largest college campuses in southern and northern California, including the University of California, Riverside, Santa Monica College, San Jose State University, University of Southern California, University of California, Los Angeles, University of California, Irvine, University of California, Berkeley, California State University, Long Beach, California State University, Northridge, California Institute of Technology, University of California, Santa Barbara, University of California, San Diego, and others. Other ministries include summer overseas mission trips where members are encouraged to participate in overseas missions to countries and regions including Thailand, Japan, Asia Minor, Cambodia, East Asia, Mongolia, Central Asia, Laos, South Africa and Hawaii for interstate mission. Activities during the mission may include cross-cultural events, teaching English to foreigners, showing films and performing Tae-Kwon-Do demonstrations and if circumstances are safe enough, proselytism. Since 1997, Korea Campus Crusade for Christ, Los Angeles, has been conducting annual summer mission trips that came to include upwards of 500 college students participating in the ministry as short-term missionaries. KCCC has a weekly prayer gathering every Friday at Dong Shin Church in Fullerton. iMPACT iMPACT is a dance ministry within KCCC. The team practices at KCCC Headquarters. iMPACT consists of members all over California from University of California Colleges, Cal State Universities, and Community Colleges. the director and coordinator was Jason Cheung. iMPACT's main performance is the annual Vision Conference, E-Crusade, and Korea Conference.

Business value expands concept of value of the firm beyond economic value (also known as economic profit, economic value added, and shareholder value) to include other forms of value such as employee value, customer value, supplier value, channel partner value, alliance partner value, managerial value, and societal value. Many of these forms of value are not directly measured in monetary terms. Business value often embraces intangible assets not necessarily attributable to any stakeholder group. Examples include intellectual capital and a firm's business model. The balanced scorecard methodology is one of the most popular methods for measuring and managing business value. Philosophy The concept of business value aligned with the theory that a firm is best viewed as a network of relationships both internal and external. These networks are sometimes called a value network or value chain. Each node in the network could be a stakeholder group, a resource, an organization, end-consumers, interest groups, regulators, or the environment itself. In a value network, value creation is viewed as a collaborative, creative, synergistic process rather than purely mechanistic or a result of command-and-control. If the firm is viewed as a network of value creating entities, then the question becomes how does each node in the network contribute to overall firm performance and how does it behave and respond to its own interests. When the nodes are independent organizations (e.g., suppliers) or agents (e.g., customers), it is assumed that the firm is seeking a cooperative, win-win relationship where all parties receive value. Even when nodes in the network are not fully independent (e.g., employees), it is assumed that incentives are important and that those incentives go beyond direct financial compensation. While it would be very desirable to translate all forms of business value to a single economic measure (e.g., discounted cash flow), many practitioners and theorists believe this is either not feasible or theoretically impossible. Therefore, advocates of business value believe that the best approach is to measure and manage multiple forms of value as they apply to each stakeholder group. As yet, there are no well- formed theories about how the various elements of business value are related to each other and how they might contribute to the firm's long-term success. One promising approach is the business model, but these are rarely formalized. History Peter Drucker was an early proponent of business value as the proper goal of a firm, especially that a firm should create value for customers, employees (especially knowledge workers), and distribution partners. His management by objectives was a goal setting and decision-making tool to help managers at all levels create business value. However, he was skeptical that the dynamics of business value could ever be formalized, at least not with current methods. Michael Porter popularized the concept of the value chain. Components =Shareholder value= For a publicly traded company, shareholder value is the part of its capitalization that is equity as opposed to long-term debt. In the case of only one type of stock, this would roughly be the number of outstanding shares times current share price. Things like dividends augment shareholder value while issuing of shares (stock options) lower it. This shareholder value added should be compared to average/required increase in value, also known as cost of capital. For a privately held company, the value of the firm after debt must be estimated using one of several valuation methods, such as discounted cash flow or others. =Customer value= Customer value is the value received by the end- customer of a product or service. End-customer can include a single individual (consumer) or an organization with various individuals playing different roles in the buying-consumption processes. Customer value is conceived variously as utility, quality, benefits, and customer satisfaction. Customer Value Management was started by Ray Kordupleski in the 1980s and discussed in his book Mastering Customer Value Management; an extended version of it is Total Customer Value Management modified by Gautam Mahajan and first exposed in his book Customer Value Investment: Formula for Sustained Business Success and Total Customer Value Management. =Employee knowledge= This is often an undervalued asset in companies and also the area where there is the most discord in reporting. Employees are the most valuable asset companies possess and the one we expect the most from, but often the one that receives the short end of the stick when it comes to values applied to them. =Channel partner value= The value a business underpins on partner relationships in the business. Partner value here stresses that it can be critical to a firms functioning. It ceases to exist or carry out business activities if partner value is diminished or lost. Strategies for Creating Business Value An increase or decline in Business Value that an action produces is traditionally measured in terms of Customer Satisfaction, Revenue Growth, Profitability, Market Share, Wallet Share, Cross-Sell Ratio, Marketing Campaign Response Rates, or Relationship Duration. =Business Value of Information Technology= Various factors affect the business value impact of Information Technology (IT). The most important factor is the alignment between IT and business processes, organization structure, and strategy. At the highest levels, this alignment is achieved through proper integration of enterprise architecture, business architecture, process design, organization design, and performance metrics. At the level of computing and communications infrastructure, the following performance factors constrain and partially determine IT capabilities: * Usability * Functionality * Availability * Reliability, recoverability * Performance (throughput, response time, predictability, capacity, etc.) * Security * Agility The term value-driven design was devised to describe the approach to planning business change (especially systems) based on the incremental improvements to business value - this is seen clearly in agile software development, where the goals of each iteration of product delivery are prioritised on what delivers highest business value drives. Criticisms Business value is an informal concept and there is no consensus, either in academic circles or among management professionals, on its meaning or on its role in effective decision-making. The term could even be described as a \\"buzz word\\" used by various consultants, analyst firms, executives, authors, and academics. Some critics believe that measuring economic value, economic profit, or shareholder value is sufficiently complete to guide decision-making. They regard all other forms of value as essentially intermediate to the ultimate goal of economic profit. Furthermore, if they do not contribute to economic profit, they are actually a distraction for the firm. Other critics believe that extensive efforts to measure business value will be more of a distraction than a boon. For example, there is a fear that decision-makers will become confused if they have too many goals and measures that need to be accommodated.

Other leading population settlements are All Saints (3,412) and Liberta (2,239), according to the 2001 census. English Harbour on the south-eastern coast provides protected shelter during violent storms. It is the site of a restored British colonial naval station named \\"Nelson's Dockyard\\" after Admiral Horatio Nelson. English Harbour and the neighbouring village of Falmouth are yachting and sailing destinations and provisioning centres. During Antigua Sailing Week, at the end of April and beginning of May, an annual regatta brings a number of sailing vessels and sailors to the island to take part in sporting events. On 6 September 2017, the Category 5 Hurricane Irma destroyed 90 percent of the buildings on the island of Barbuda and the entire population was evacuated to Antigua.  History  Rocky shoreline near St. John's. Dickenson Bay beach, Antigua = Early Antiguans = The first inhabitants were the Guanahatabey people. Eventually, the Arawak migrated from the mainland, followed by the Carib. Prior to European colonialism, Christopher Columbus was the first European to visit Antigua, in 1493. The Arawak were the first well-documented group of indigenous people to settle Antigua. They paddled to the island by canoe (piragua) from present-day Venezuela, pushed out by the Carib, another indigenous people. The Arawak introduced agriculture to Antigua and Barbuda. Among other crops, they cultivated the Antiguan \\"Black\\" pineapple. They also grew Corn, Sweet potatoes (white with firmer flesh than the bright orange \\"sweet potato\\" grown in the United States), Chili peppers, Guava, Tobacco, and Cotton. Some of the vegetables listed, such as corn and sweet potatoes, continue to be staples of Antiguan cuisine. Colonists took them to Europe, and from there, they spread around the world. For example, a popular Antiguan dish, dukuna (), is a sweet, steamed dumpling made from grated sweet potatoes, flour and spices. Another staple, fungi (), is a cooked paste made of cornmeal and water. Most of the Arawak left Antigua about A.D. 1100. Those who remained were raided by the Carib coming from Venezuela. According to The Catholic Encyclopedia, the Caribs' superior weapons and seafaring prowess allowed them to defeat most Arawak nations in the West Indies. They enslaved some and cannibalised others. See also The Catholic Encyclopedia entries for \\"Arawaks\\" and \\"Caribs\\". Watson points out that the Caribs had a much more warlike culture than the Arawak. The indigenous people of the West Indies built excellent sea vessels, which they used to sail the Atlantic and Caribbean resulting in much of the South American and the Caribbean islands being populated by the Arawak and Carib. Their descendants live throughout South America, particularly Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia. = British = Aerial view of Jolly Harbour on the western coast of Antigua. Christopher Columbus named the island \\"Antigua\\" in 1493 in honour of the \\"Virgin of the Old Cathedral\\" () found in Seville Cathedral in southern Spain. On his 1493 voyage, honouring a vow, he named many islands after different aspects of St. Mary, including Montserrat and Guadeloupe. In 1632, a group of English colonists left St. Kitts to settle on Antigua. Sir Christopher Codrington, an Englishman, established the first permanent British settlement. The island rapidly developed as a profitable sugar colony. For a large portion of Antigua history, the island was considered Britain's \\"Gateway to the Caribbean\\". It was located on the major sailing routes among the region's resource-rich colonies. Lord Horatio Nelson, a major figure in Antigua history, arrived in the late 18th century to preserve the island's commercial shipping prowess. According to A Brief History of the Caribbean, British diseases, malnutrition and slavery eventually destroyed the vast majority of the Caribbean's native population. There are some differences of opinions as to the relative importance of these causes. = Slavery = Slaves planting and tilling, 1823 Slaves working in the boiling house, 1823 Slaves loading barrels into a boat, 1823 Sugar became Antigua's main crop in about 1674, when Christopher Codrington (c 1640-1698) settled at Betty's Hope plantation. He came from Barbados, bringing the latest sugar technology with him. Betty's Hope, Antigua's first full-scale sugar plantation, was so successful that other planters turned from tobacco to sugar. This resulted in their importing slaves to work the sugar cane crops. According to A Brief History of the Caribbean, many West Indian colonists initially tried to use locals as slaves. These groups succumbed easily to disease and/or malnutrition, and died by the thousands. The enslaved Africans adapted better to the new environment and thus became the number one choice of unpaid labour; they also provided medical services and skilled labour, including carpentry, for their masters. However, according to a Smithsonian Institution article, the West African slave population in the Caribbean also had a high mortality rate, which was compensated by regular imports of very high numbers of new slaves from West and Central Africa. Sugar cane was one of the most grueling and dangerous crops slaves were forced to cultivate. Harvesting cane required backbreaking long days in sugar cane fields under the hot island sun. Sugar cane spoiled quickly after harvest, and the milling process was slow and inefficient, forcing the mill and boiling house to operate 24 hours a day during harvest season. Sugar mills and boiling houses were two of the most dangerous places for slaves to work on sugar plantations. In mills wooden or metal rollers were used to crush cane plants and extract the juices. Slaves were at risk of getting their limbs stuck and ripped off in the machines. Similarly, in sugar boiling houses slaves worked under extremely high temperatures and at the risk of being burned in the boiling sugar mixture or getting their limbs stuck. Today, collectors prize the uniquely designed colonial furniture built by West Indian slaves. Many of these works feature what are now considered \\"traditional\\" motifs, such as pineapples, fish and stylized serpents. By the mid-1770s, the number of slaves had increased to 37,500, up from 12,500 in 1713. The British population had fallen from 5,000 to below 3,000. The slaves lived in wretched and overcrowded conditions and could be mistreated or even killed by their owners with impunity. The Slave Act of 1723 made arbitrary murder of slaves a crime, but did not do much to ease their lives.Dyde, B. (2000). A history of Antigua: The unsuspected isle. Interlink Publishing Group Incorporated. Unrest against enslavement among the Black Antiguans became increasingly common. In 1729, a man named Hercules was hanged, drawn, and quartered and three others were burnt alive, for conspiring to kill the slave owner Crump and his family. In 1736, an enslaved man called \\"Prince Klaas\\" (whose slave name was Court) allegedly planned an uprising in which British slavers would be massacred. Court was crowned \\"King of the Coromantees\\" in a pasture outside the capital of St. John's. The coronation appeared to be just a colourful spectacle but was, for the enslaved people, a ritual declaration of war on the British slavers. Due to information obtained from other slaves, colonists discovered the plot and suppressed it. Prince Klaas and four accomplices were caught and executed by the breaking wheel. (However, some doubts exist about Court's guilt.) Six of the rebels were hanged in chains and starved to death, and another 58 were burned at the stake. The site of these executions is now the Antiguan Recreation Ground.Brian Dyde, A History of Antigua, London & Oxford: Macmillan Education, 2000. The American War of Independence in the late 18th century disrupted the Caribbean sugar trade. At the same time, public opinion in Great Britain gradually turned against slavery. \\"Traveling ... at slavery's end, [Joseph] Sturge and [Thomas] Harvey (1838 ...) found few married slaves residing together or even on the same estate. Slaveholders often counted as 'married' only those slaves with mates on the estate.\\"Morrissey, Marietta, Slave Women in the New World: Gender Stratification in the Caribbean. Lawrence, Kans.: University Press of Kansas, 1989 (), p. 85 and see p. 99 (author assoc. prof. sociology, University of Toledo). Great Britain abolished the slave trade in 1807, and all existing slaves were emancipated in 1834. = Horatio, Lord Nelson = Horatio Nelson (who was created 1st Viscount Nelson in 1801) was Senior Naval Officer of the Leeward Islands from 1784 to 1787 on . During his tenure, he tried to enforce the Navigation Acts. These acts prohibited trade with the newly formed United States of America. Most of the merchants in Antigua depended upon American trade, so many of them despised Captain Nelson. As a result, he was unable to get a promotion for some time after his stint on the island. Unlike the Antiguan merchants, Nelson had a positive view of the controversial Navigation Acts: > The Americans were at this time trading with our islands, taking advantage > of the register of their ships, which had been issued while they were > British subjects. Nelson knew that, by the Navigation Act, no foreigners, > directly or indirectly, are permitted to carry on any trade with these > possessions. He knew, also, that the Americans had made themselves > foreigners with regard to England; they had disregarded the ties of blood > and language when they acquired the independence which they had been led on > to claim, unhappily for themselves, before they were fit for it; and he was > resolved that they should derive no profit from those ties now. Foreigners > they had made themselves, and as foreigners they were to be treated. Nelson said: \\"The Antiguan Colonists are as great rebels as ever were in America, had they the power to show it.\\" A dockyard started in 1725, to provide a base for a squadron of British ships whose main function was to patrol the West Indies and thus maintain Britain's sea power, was later named \\"Nelson's Dockyard\\" in his honour. While Nelson was stationed on Antigua, he frequently visited the nearby island of Nevis, where he met and married a young widow, Fanny Nisbet, who had previously married the son of a plantation family on Nevis. = 1918 labour unrest = Following the foundation of the Ulotrichian Universal Union, a friendly society which acted as a trade union (which were banned), the sugar cane workers were ready to confront the plantation owners when they slashed their wages. The cane workers went on strike and rioted when their leaders were arrested. = Independence = In 1968, with Barbuda and the tiny island of Redonda as dependencies, Antigua became an associated state of the Commonwealth, and in 1981 it was disassociated from Britain. =U.S. government presence = Commissioned, 9 August 1956, the Naval Facility (NAVFAC) Antigua was one of the shore terminal stations that were part of the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) and the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS), which were used to track Soviet submarines. NAVFAC Antigua was decommissioned 4 February 1984. From 1958 through 1960 the United States installed the Missile Impact Location System (MILS) in the Atlantic Missile Range, later the Eastern Range, to localize the splash downs of test missile nose cones. MILS was developed and installed by the same entities that had completed the first phase of the Atlantic SOSUS system. A MILS installation consisting of both a target array for precision location and a broad ocean area system for good positions outside the target area was installed at Antigua, down range. The island was the second down range MILS installation with the furthest being down range at Ascension Island. Until July 7, 2015, the United States Air Force maintained a small base near the airport, designated Detachment 1, 45th Operations Group, 45th Space Wing (known as Antigua Air Station). The mission provided high rate telemetry data for the Eastern Range and its space launches. The unit was deactivated due to US government budget cuts and the property given to the Antiguan Government.  Demographics  St. John's Cathedral Geography Located in the Leeward Islands Antigua has an area of with of coastline. The highest elevation on the island is . Various natural points, capes, and beaches around the island include: Boon Point, Beggars Point, Parham, Willikies, Hudson Point, English Harbour Town, Old Road Cape, Johnson's Point, Ffryes Point, Jennings, Five Islands, and Yepton Beach, and Runaway Beach. Several natural harbours are formed by these points and capes, including: Fitches Creek Bay, between Beggars Point and Parham; Nonsuch Bay between Hudson Point and Willikies; Willoughby Bay, between Hudson Point and English Harbour Town; English Harbour leading into English Harbour Town; Falmouth Harbour recessing into Falmouth; Rendezvous Bay between Falmouth and Old Road Cape; Five Islands Harbour, between Jennings and Five Islands; and Green Bay, the main harbour at St. John's, between Yepton Beach and Runaway Beach. =Fauna= The Antiguan racer is among the rarest snakes in the world. The Lesser Antilles are home to four species of racers. All four have undergone severe range reductions; at least two subspecies are extinct and another, A. antiguae, now occupies only 0.1 percent of its historical range. Griswold's ameiva (Ameiva griswoldi) is a species of lizard in the genus Ameiva. It is endemic to Antigua and Barbuda. It is found on both islands. Governance Local government is provided by six civil parishes: St. George, Saint Peter, Saint Philip, Saint Paul, Saint Mary, and Saint John.  Economy  The country's official currency is the East Caribbean dollar. Given the dominance of tourism, many prices in tourist-oriented businesses are shown in US dollars. The EC dollar is pegged to the US dollar at a varied rate and averages about US$1 = EC$2.7. =Tourism= Antigua's economy relies largely on tourism, and the island is promoted as a luxury Caribbean escape. Many hotels and resorts are located around the coastline. The island's single airport, VC Bird Airport, is served by several major airlines, including Virgin Atlantic, British Airways, American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Caribbean Airlines, Air Canada, WestJet, and JetBlue. There is regular air service to Barbuda. =Education= Antigua has two international primary/secondary schools: CCSET International, which offers the Ontario Secondary School Diploma, and Island Academy, which offers the International Baccalaureate. There are also many other private schools but these institutions tend to follow the same local curriculum (CXCs) as government schools. The island of Antigua currently has two foreign-owned for-profit offshore medical schools, the American University of Antigua (AUA), founded in 2004, and The University of Health Sciences Antigua (UHSA), founded in 1982. The island's medical schools cater mostly to foreign students but contribute to the local economy and health care. =Online gambling= Antigua was one of the first nations to legalize, license, and regulate online gambling and is a primary location for incorporation of online gambling companies. Some countries, most notably the United States, argue that if a particular gambling transaction is initiated outside the country of Antigua then that transaction is governed by the laws of the country where the transaction was initiated. This argument was brought before WTO and was deemed incorrect. In 2006, the United States Congress voted to approve the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act which criminalized the operations of offshore gambling operators which take wagers from American-based gamblers. This was a prima facie violation of the GATS treaty obligations enforced by the WTO, resulting in a series of rulings unfavorable to the US. On 21 December 2007, an Article 22 arbitration panel ruled that the United States' failure to comply with WTO rules would attract a US$21 million sanction. The WTO ruling was notable in two respects: First, although technically a victory for Antigua, the $21 million was far less than the US$3.5 billion which had been sought; one of the three arbitrators was sufficiently bothered by the propriety of this that he issued a dissenting opinion. Second, a rider to the arbitration ruling affirmed the right of Antigua to take retaliatory steps in view of the prior failure of the US to comply with GATS. These included the rare, but not unprecedented, right to disregard intellectual property obligations to the US. Antigua's obligations to the US in respect of patents, copyright, and trademarks are affected. In particular, Berne Convention copyright is in question, and also material not covered by the Berne convention, including TRIPS accord obligations to the US. Antigua may thus disregard the WIPO treaty on intellectual property rights, and therefore the US implementation of that treaty (the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA)‚Äîat least up to the limit of compensation. Since there is no appeal to the WTO from an Arbitration panel of this kind, it represents the last legal word from the WTO on the matter. Antigua is therefore able to recoup some of the claimed loss of trade by hosting (and taxing) companies whose business model depends on immunity from TRIPS provisions. Software company SlySoft was based in Antigua, allowing it to avoid nations with laws that are tough on anti-circumvention of technological copyright measures, in particular the DMCA in the United States. = Banking = Swiss American Bank Ltd., later renamed Global Bank of Commerce, Ltd, was formed in April 1983 and became the first Off-shore International Financial institution governed by the International Business Corporations, Act of 1982 licensed bank in Antigua. The bank was later sued by the United States for failure to release forfeited funds from one of its account holders.\\"United States Court of Appeals, First Circuit. UNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff, Appellant, v. SWISS AMERICAN BANK, LTD., et al., Defendants, Appellees\\". No. 99-1012. 8 September 1999. Swiss American Bank was founded by Bruce Rappaport.\\"Rappaport dies\\", Antigua Observer, 9 January 2010. Stanford International Bank was formed by Allen Stanford in 1986 in Montserrat where it was called Guardian International Bank. On 17 February 2009, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Allen Stanford, Laura Pendergest- Holt and James Davis with fraud in connection with the bank's US$8 billion certificate of deposit (CD) investment scheme that offered \\"improbable and unsubstantiated high interest rates\\". This led the federal government to freeze the assets of the bank and other Stanford entities. On 27 February 2009, Pendergest-Holt was arrested by federal agents in connection with the alleged fraud. On that day, the SEC said that Stanford and his accomplices operated a \\"massive Ponzi scheme\\", misappropriated billions of investors' money and falsified the Stanford International Bank's records to hide their fraud. \\"Stanford International Bank's financial statements, including its investment income, are fictional,\\" the SEC said.\\"New SEC Complaint Says Stanford Ran Ponzi Scheme\\", The Wall Street Journal, 27 February 2009. Antigua Overseas Bank (AOB) was part of the ABI Financial Group and was a licensed bank in Antigua. On 13 April 2012, AOB was placed into receivership by the government of Antigua.\\"Offshore bank placed under receivership\\", Antigua Observer, 13 April 2012. On 27 November 2018, Scotiabank, the leading commercial bank on the island, announced plans to sell its banking operations in Antigua and 9 other non-core Caribbean markets to Republic Financial Holdings Limited.  Sport  The major Antiguan sport is cricket. Vivian (\\"Viv\\") Richards is one of the most famous Antiguans, who played for, and captained, the West Indies cricket team. Richards scored the fastest Test century at the Antigua Recreation Ground, it was also the venue at which Brian Lara twice broke the world record for an individual Test innings (375 in 1993/94, 400 not out in 2003/04). Antigua was the location of a 2007 Cricket World Cup site, on a new Recreation Ground constructed on an old cane field in the north of the island. Both football (soccer) and basketball are becoming popular among the island youth. There are several golf courses in Antigua. Daniel Bailey was the first athlete to win a global world medal at the 2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships. Being surrounded by water, sailing is one of the most popular sports with Antigua Sailing Week and Antigua Classic Yacht Regatta being two of the region's most reputable sailing competitions. Hundreds of yachts from around the world compete around Antigua each year. Sport Fishing is also a very popular sport with several big competitions held yearly. Windsurfing was very popular until kite-surfing came to the island. Kitesurfing or kite-boarding is very popular at Jabbawock Beach.

She was seized by the Germans during the Second World War, and served several stints in the Kriegsmarine. Having resumed her Hurtigruten service after the war until 1951, and in 1952 she was renamed Sylvia. At the same year, she was transferred to the Royal Norwegian Navy, and served under the name HNoMS Valkyrien as a motor torpedo boat tender between 1953 and 1963. Ship history The ship was built by Burmeister & Wain at Copenhagen for the Bergen Steamship Company. She was designed for their coastal service, and as a replacement for the ship Astraea, which had sunk in January 1910. Named Polarlys (\\"Aurora\\"), the ship was launched on 10 January 1912, and delivered in April 1912. At 1,069 gross register tons and 536 tons deadweight Polarlys was 208 feet long with 65 first class cabins, 32 second class, and 44 third class. Her triple expansion steam engines developed 1,473 IHP, and during sea trials she attained a maximum speed of 13.45 knots. She was refitted in 1930 and the number of cabins reduced. Polarlys arriving at Molde in 1927 Polarlys was in Bergen on 9 April 1940 when the Germans captured the town and was soon taken over by the Kriegsmarine for use as an accommodation ship. They painted the name Satan on the ship, but was later changed to simply Tan. She was returned to her owners in December 1940, but was requisitioned by the Germans once again in October and November 1944 for use as a troop transport as they retreated from northern Norway. In March 1945, the ship laid up at Stamnes in the Osterfjord and remained there until the end of the war in Europe. After a refit Polarlys returned to the coastal service in July 1945. However she was now showing her age, and was withdrawn from service on 12 October 1951. Laid up in Bergen, she was renamed Sylvia in April 1952, releasing the name for a new ship which was built in √Ölborg same year. =As Valkyrien= KNM Valkyrien in Alta On 1 July 1952 the ship was bought by the Royal Norwegian Navy, converted to a motor torpedo boat tender at the Bergen Mekaniske Verksted yard at Laksev√•g, and was commissioned as Valkyrien in June 1953. In connection with a rescue operation in 1956 in the Arctic the ship was outfitted with a Bell helicopter. She had a displacement of 1,500 tons and a top speed of . She had a crew of 76 and was armed with one 3-inch and three 40 mm guns. She remained in naval service until 1963, and was sold for scrapping in Odense the following year. =In literary fiction= SS Polarlys was the backdrop of the first detective novel Georges Simenon (of Maigret fame) ever signed with his real name instead of a pseudonym. In this non-Maigret novel (French title Le Passager du Polarlys) the ship's captain (whose character is not unlike Maigret) has to turn detective after a German police investigator has been murdered on board his ship, in connection with the drug-related death of a young model in the Montparnasse painters and drop-outs Parisian community of the roaring twenties. The whole story unfolds during the trip from Hamburg (then the start of the Bergen Steamship Company arm of the Hurtigruten) to the northern Hurtigruten terminal in Kirkenes where the criminal commits suicide by jumping overboard, while his female accomplice (and sister) attempts escape to Soviet Union (then without extradition agreements with capitalist western countries).

The route, a limited-access northward continuation of Interstate 390 (I-390), extends for from I-490 in Gates to the Lake Ontario State Parkway in Greece, less than from the Lake Ontario shoreline. Between I-490 and NY 104, NY 390 makes up the north-south segment of the northwest quadrant of the Rochester Outer Loop, a series of expressways encircling Rochester. At NY 104, the Outer Loop departs NY 390 and follows NY 104 east into the city. The freeway was constructed in stages from the 1960s to the 1980s, with the first segment‚Äîbetween I-490 and NY 31‚Äîopening to traffic . At the time, it was part of NY 47, which followed the completed portions of the Outer Loop from Gates to Irondequoit. An extension of the freeway north to U.S. Route 104 (US 104; now NY 104) was opened to traffic in the early 1970s. NY 47 was eliminated in 1980, giving way to NY 390 from I-490 to NY 104\\\\. NY 390 was extended to its current length in the early 1980s. Route description NY 390 begins at the point where I-390 northbound crosses over I-490 eastbound in the center of a complex interchange between the two in Gates. Due to the setup of the junction, the northbound and southbound roadways, both two lanes wide, are initially set about apart. The highway heads through the remainder of the exit, passing over the left exit ramp from I-490 west to I-390 south heading northbound and under the ramp linking I-490 east to NY 390 north southbound and crossing over I-490 westbound. North of the junction, the median narrows to a more standard width as NY 390 widens to six lanes and connects to NY 31 (Lyell Avenue). The expressway proceeds north through neighborhoods equally residential and industrial, crossing over both the former right-of-way of the CSX Transportation-owned Falls Road Secondary Track and the Erie Canal prior to meeting Lexington Avenue via a modified trumpet interchange. The junction of NY 390 and NY 104 (West Ridge Road) in Greece From Lexington Avenue, where NY 390 passes into the town of Greece, north to NY 104, NY 390 runs parallel to the western edge of Eastman Business Park, the large production and distribution complex owned and maintained by Eastman Kodak. Midway between the Lexington Avenue and West Ridge Road exits, NY 390 encounters Ridgeway Avenue via a partial diamond interchange. Just north of Ridgeway Avenue, the expressway crosses a small, narrow strip of land that lies within the Rochester city limits, a carryover from when the Erie Canal occupied this tract and entered the city decades before. North of the strip, NY 390 curves to the northeast, passing along the west side of the industrial park and the eastern edge of a residential yet wooded area to reach NY 104\\\\. Heading northbound, it splits into two halves, with exit 24A connecting to NY 104 east and exit 24B linking to NY 104 west. Past NY 104, the roadway surface shifts from pavement to concrete as the freeway heads generally northward through primarily residential neighborhoods. This section northwards to the Lake Ontario State Parkway is designated the \\"Assemblyman Roger J. Robach Memorial Lakeway\\" by state law. The next exit, with Vintage Lane to the north-northeast of NY 104, is the highway's last as a six-lane freeway. Here, it narrows to four lanes‚Äîtwo in both directions‚Äîbefore continuing onward to meet NY 18 (Latta Road) at a conventional diamond interchange. At this point, all commercial vehicles are forced to exit NY 390 due to a similar restriction on the Lake Ontario State Parkway to the north. Outside of a small pocket of development near Greece Arcadia High and Middle Schools, the remainder of the freeway crosses open, sparsely developed areas of Greece. NY 390 curves to the northeast for its final before ending at a trumpet interchange with the parkway from the shore of Lake Ontario. History The segment of the Rochester Outer Loop between NY 33A and NY 31 was completed . It was originally designated as part of NY 47, which had followed the parallel Howard Road to the west prior to the freeway's construction. Work on an extension north to US 104 (now NY 104) began in the mid-1960s and was completed in the early 1970s. The freeway officially became part of NY 47 on January 1, 1970, when the route was extended northward over the then-proposed Outer Loop to a new terminus at the Lake Ontario State Parkway. In actuality, however, NY 47 never extended any farther north than NY 104, which served as the freeway's northern terminus throughout the 1970s. Approaching the Lake Ontario Parkway on NY 390 north In the late 1970s, the state of New York submitted a proposal to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials that would substantially alter how the Outer Loop was numbered. As part of the plan, the NY 47 designation would be eliminated while the northwestern section of the Outer Loop‚Äîfrom I-490 in Gates to the proposed northern terminus at the Lake Ontario Parkway in Greece‚Äîwould become the northernmost part of I-390. Most of the proposed changes took effect on March 18, 1980, when NY 47 was eliminated; however, I-390 was modified to end at its junction with I-490. In its place, the Gates‚ÄìGreece leg of the Outer Loop was assigned NY 390. The NY 390 designation was extended northward to its current terminus in the early 1980s when the segment of the Outer Loop between NY 104 and the Lake Ontario State Parkway was completed. The highway began experiencing dramatic increases in traffic, especially after the highway was extended to the Lake Ontario State Parkway post 1980‚Äôs. As Greece and towns on the northwest side of Rochester have expanded, NY-390 emerged as the primary highway link southward. The interchange of NY/I-390 and I-490 currently serves over 200,000 cars daily ‚Äî compared to 25,000 when it was designed and opened in the 1960s ‚Äî and regularly has heavy congestion during the morning and evening rush hours. Major slowdowns on 390 are often influenced by the interchange at 490 and Lyell Avenue. Starting in 2010, the New York State Department of Transportation began soliciting ideas on how to improve the junction. The overall project includes four phases, with $150 million in state and federal funding. The project launched in May 2017, with the replacement of the (NY-31) Lyell Avenue Bridge (which was completed in July 2018).

After the war, she worked as a clerk for Cuthbert Heath, a firm of underwriters at Lloyd's of London.  Marriage  In June 1947, at a dance at Nutford House organised by the London Missionary Society, her sister introduced her to Prince Seretse Khama. He was the son of the paramount chief Sekgoma II of the Bamangwato people and was studying law at Inner Temple in London after a year at Balliol College, Oxford. The couple were both fans of jazz music, particularly The Ink Spots, and quickly fell in love.Cornwell, Rupert (30 May 2002), \\"Ruth Khama: Bride in 'a marriage of inconvenience'\\", The Independent. Their plans to marry caused controversy with elders in Bechuanaland and the government of South Africa, which had recently instituted the system of racial segregation known as apartheid. The British government intervened to stop the marriage. The Bishop of London, William Wand, said he would permit a church wedding only if the government agreed. The couple married at Kensington register office in September 1948.\\"Lady Khama (Ruth Williams)\\", The Scotsman, 30 May 2002 Daniel Malan, Prime Minister of South Africa, described their marriage as \\"nauseating\\". Julius Nyerere, then a student teacher and later President of Tanzania, said it was \\"one of the great love stories of the world\\". The couple returned to Bechuanaland, a British protectorate, where Seretse's uncle Tshekedi Khama was regent. After receiving popular support in Bechuanaland, Seretse was called to London in 1950 for discussions with British officials. He was prevented from returning home and told he had to remain in exile. Ruth joined him in England and the married couple lived as exiles from 1951, living in Croydon. Popular support and protest continued in Bechuanaland. The couple were permitted to return in 1956 after the Bamangwato people sent a telegram to Queen Elizabeth II. Seretse renounced his throne and became a cattle farmer in Serowe. Seretse founded the nationalist Bechuanaland Democratic Party and won the 1965 general election. As prime minister of Bechuanaland, he pushed for independence, which was granted in 1966. Seretse Khama became the first president of independent Botswana and he became a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. Lady Khama was an influential, politically active First Lady during her husband's four consecutive terms as president from 1966 to 1980.  Family  Lady Khama and her husband had four children. Their first child Jacqueline was born in Bechuanaland in 1950, shortly after Seretse was exiled. Their first son Ian was born in England in 1953, and twins Anthony and Tshekedi were born in Bechuanaland in 1958 (Anthony was named after Tony Benn, then known as Anthony Wedgwood Benn, who supported their return from exile in the early 1950s). She remained in Botswana after her husband's death in office in 1980, receiving recognition as \\"Mohumagadi Mma Kgosi\\" (mother of the chief, or queen mother). Despite the national controversy surrounding their union in the 1940s and 1950s, the couple were inseparable until his death from cancer in 1980. After her husband's death, she lived on a large farm in Botswana, dedicating her time and efforts to charitable causes and spending time with her children and grandchildren. Two of their sons, Ian and Tshekedi, have become prominent politicians in Botswana. Ian Khama was elected as the President of Botswana in 2008.  Death  Lady Khama died of throat cancer in Gaborone at the age of 78, survived by her four children.

The route is a limited-access northward extension of Interstate 590 (I-590) that begins at the Can of Worms, an interchange between I-490, I-590, and NY 590 on the boundary between the town of Brighton and the city of Rochester, and ends at a roundabout with Titus Avenue in the town of Irondequoit. NY 590 is known as the Sea Breeze Expressway, a name derived from the small community of Sea Breeze located near the highway's former northern terminus at Culver Road near the southern shore of Lake Ontario. The portion of NY 590 between the Can of Worms and NY 104 is part of the northeastern quadrant of the Rochester Outer Loop, a series of expressways that form a beltway around the city of Rochester. At NY 104, the Outer Loop turns west to follow NY 104 through Irondequoit. The Sea Breeze Expressway was built in stages from the 1950s to the 1960s and carried various designations until 1970, when the entirety of the Rochester ‚Äì Sea Breeze highway was designated as part of NY 47\\\\. It was redesignated as NY 590 in 1980. In the late 2000s, the section of NY 590 north of Titus Avenue was reconfigured into a two-lane road named Sea Breeze Drive, and NY 590 was truncated to end at Titus Avenue. Route description Just north of NY 286 on NY 590 northbound in Rochester The four-lane I-590 becomes NY 590 upon passing under I-490 at the Can of Worms on the eastern edge of Rochester. It heads northeast into Brighton and through the remainder of the interchange, passing under the ramp connecting I-490 west to I-590 south, the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision, and the ramps from NY 590 south to I-490 in succession before widening to six lanes and turning northward ahead of a diamond interchange with Blossom Road, once designated as NY 286A. Between Blossom Road and NY 286 (Browncroft Boulevard), NY 590 slowly turns to the northwest, passing through densely populated neighborhoods located adjacent to the Rochester‚ÄìBrighton boundary. It reaches the city line and reenters Rochester upon meeting NY 286. The lone portion of NY 590 within the city of Rochester runs due north‚Äìsouth, acting as a divider between residential neighborhoods to the west and the Irondequoit Creek valley (much of which is part of Ellison Park) to the east. Little more than a half mile after entering the city, NY 590 exits the city and enters the neighboring town of Irondequoit. Here, the freeway turns to the northwest to avoid the area surrounding the intersection of North Winton Road and NY 404 (Empire Boulevard). After passing under North Winton Road, NY 590 resumes its northward trek and connects to NY 404 by way of a modified cloverleaf interchange. The expressway continues onward, separating a large residential area from Irondequoit Bay Park West as it progresses toward a northbound-only exit with Norton Street. One half-mile to the north of Norton, NY 590 meets NY 104 via a large interchange. The current northern terminus of NY 590 at Titus Avenue Due to the terrain surrounding the interchange and the location of the Irondequoit Bay Bridge, NY 104 is forced to run parallel to NY 590 for a short distance between the Keeler Street Expressway and NY 590's next exit, a diamond interchange connecting to East Ridge Road. Through this stretch, NY 590‚Äînow just four lanes wide‚Äîruns in between NY 104 westbound and NY 104 eastbound. At East Ridge Road, NY 104 turns to the northeast to cross Irondequoit Bay while NY 590 continues north through residential areas toward Sea Breeze. The road has an at-grade intersection with Sunrise Crescent, a private residential street, before meeting Titus Avenue at a roundabout that serves as NY 590's northern terminus. Past this point, the right-of-way of NY 590 continues north to Culver Road at the Lake Ontario shoreline as a divided two-lane street named Sea Breeze Drive. Traveling southbound on NY 590, two significant movements are restricted due to the composition of the expressway. One is at Blossom Road in Brighton, where traffic entering NY 590 southbound cannot access I-490 due to the location of the exit 5 (left exit) flyover, which begins north of the Blossom Road onramp. This movement was possible prior to the reconstruction of the Can of Worms, as the original connection point between the Sea Breeze Expressway and I-490 was south of the Blossom Road interchange. In Irondequoit, there are no southbound exits between East Ridge Road and NY 404; thus, there is no access to either NY 104 or Norton Street. An access road between NY 590 at Titus Avenue and the Irondequoit Bay Bridge was planned to provide access from NY 590 southbound to NY 104 eastbound and from NY 104 westbound to NY 590 northbound, but it was never completed. History =Construction and designation= The origins of NY 590 date back to the start of the 1950s when work first began on the Sea Breeze Expressway, a part-divided highway, part limited-access highway that extended from Rochester north to the Lake Ontario shoreline at Sea Breeze. The highway was built in stages from north to south, with the first section‚Äîa divided highway connecting Culver Road to East Ridge Road in Irondequoit‚Äîopening to traffic in the early 1950s as a realignment of NY 18\\\\. The northern end of the roadway was situated just west of the Irondequoit Bay outlet, where Irondequoit Bay meets Lake Ontario. Construction on the next segment, a limited-access extension south to Empire Boulevard (U.S. Route 104 or US 104), began in the mid-1950s. The new roadway was completed in the late 1950s, at which time it became part of a rerouted US 104. March 2008 photo of the original northern terminus of NY 590 at Culver Road By 1960, construction was underway on the final piece, a second extension south to the Eastern Expressway (I-490) in eastern Rochester. The under-construction highway generally paralleled Winton Road, then designated as part of NY 47\\\\. The new extension was completed , but went unnumbered until when NY 47 was realigned north of Blossom Road to follow the expressway north to the Empire Boulevard interchange, where it ended at US 104. The remainder of the Sea Breeze Expressway from I-490 to Blossom Road became part of NY 47 following the completion of what is now I-590 from the Can of Worms to Elmwood Avenue. From 1970 to 1980, the Sea Breeze Expressway underwent a series of designation changes. On January 1, 1970, NY 47 was extended northward to encompass the entirety of the Sea Breeze Expressway. The change resulted in overlaps with US 104 from Empire Boulevard to the new Keeler Street Expressway, which was built south of Ridge Road in the late 1960s as a realignment of US 104, and NY 18 from East Ridge Road to Culver Road, from where NY 18 continued east along Lake Road to Webster. Both overlaps proved to be temporary: US 104 was realigned to cross Irondequoit Bay on the Irondequoit Bay Bridge while NY 18 was truncated to end in Rochester's Kodak Park. In the late 1970s, the state of New York submitted a proposal to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials that would substantially alter how the Outer Loop was numbered. As part of the plan, the NY 47 designation would be eliminated while most of the northeastern section of the Outer Loop‚Äîfrom I-490 in Rochester to NY 104 (former US 104) to Irondequoit‚Äîwould become the northernmost part of I-590. A replacement designation for NY 47 north of NY 104 was not named at the time. Most of the proposed changes took effect on March 18, 1980, when NY 47 was eliminated; however, I-590 was modified to end at its junction with I-490. In its place, the Rochester‚ÄìIrondequoit leg of the Outer Loop was assigned NY 590, which continued north to Sea Breeze over former NY 47. =Sea Breeze Drive= Project origins In 1995, Irondequoit Town Supervisor David Schantz proposed the idea of converting the portion of NY 590 north of Titus Avenue into a parkway that would serve as a \\"gateway\\" into Irondequoit. He presented the idea to Jim Walsh, the United States Representative representing Irondequoit, who later secured $8 million from the federal government for the project. Another $4.5 million of funding was also devoted to the project from the state of New York. Planning for the project began in mid-2004. In late 2006, the Irondeqout Town Board chose a configuration calling for the number of lanes on NY 590 to be reduced to two and for four intersections to be replaced with roundabouts as its \\"preferred alternative\\". The final project design was presented on February 6, 2008, in the last of five public meetings on the project. Under the plan, the section of NY 590 north of Titus Avenue would be reduced to a two-lane, parkway and named \\"Sea Breeze Drive\\". Its signalized intersections with Titus Avenue, Durand Boulevard, and Seneca and Point Pleasant Roads would be converted into roundabouts as part of the reconstruction. Also, the portion of NY 590 north of Durand Boulevard would be realigned to meet Culver Road at a new intersection farther west along the lakeshore. The realignment would open up of waterfront land along the shore of Irondequoit Bay that had previously been occupied by the expressway. The town of Irondequoit would then acquire the former right-of-way of NY 590 from the state of New York for future recreational uses in a transaction that would officially cost the town $1. Public opinion on the proposed project was split. Many residents supported the project, stating it would improve the safety of the highway; however, others believed that the reduction in lanes would result in increased traffic on Culver Road, which runs parallel to NY 590 through Irondequoit, and that the roundabouts would make navigating the highway difficult. Construction On July 15, 2008, the town of Irondequoit let a $12.8 million contract for the Sea Breeze Drive project, a mark that was within the $14 million accumulated in funding by this time. Ground was officially broken on the project on July 28 as part of a ceremony attended by several Rochester-area dignitaries. Among those present were Jim Walsh and David Schantz, both of whom played large roles in making the project a reality. The corridor was subsequently reduced to two lanes as the southbound lanes of NY 590 were reconfigured to handle both directions of traffic while work ensued on permanently narrowing the northbound lanes to a single lane. Northbound traffic on NY 590 was realigned to use the new northbound lane on August 17, 2009. The first two of the roundabouts to reach operational status were those at Point Pleasant Road and Durand Boulevard. The Point Pleasant Road roundabout opened to traffic on September 8, 2009, by which time the Durand Boulevard roundabout was also ready for use. The Titus Avenue roundabout was completed in late 2009, while work on the Seneca Road junction was delayed until October 2009 due to the proximity of the intersection to the side of the hill overlooking Irondequoit Bay. Although the original plans for the project had already accounted for the issue, the plans had to be revised to comply with new federal standards regarding the use of steel pilings for supporting the hillside. Work on the roundabout finally began on October 12. The Seneca Road roundabout and the new alignment of Sea Breeze Drive north of Durand Boulevard were completed in the first half of 2010. Sea Breeze Drive at Durand Boulevard The completion date for the project, dubbed \\"the largest public works project ever done in the town of Irondequoit\\" by then-Town Supervisor Mary Ellen Heyman, was pushed back several times. It was originally set for May 2010, but was subsequently pushed back to late August or early September. It was finally completed in October 2010 with the installation of a decorative ship mast structure at the Durand Boulevard roundabout. Following the project's completion, NY 590 was truncated to Titus Avenue and ownership and maintenance of Sea Breeze Drive was transferred to the town of Irondequoit. According to New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) official Rick Papaj, the state turned Sea Breeze Drive over to the town because the portion of NY 590 north of Titus Avenue had low traffic volumes and was situated in a residential area. Papaj added, \\"[the portion of NY 590 north of Titus Avenue] didn't make sense (to us) anymore. 590 effectively ends at Route 104.\\" Exit list See also *Interstate 590 for exits 1‚Äì4 References External links 590 Category:Transportation in Rochester, New York Category:Limited-access roads in New York (state) ","title":"New York State Route 590"},{"id":"1967566","text":"Bernard Leslie Sparkes (born October 15, 1940) is a former world champion curler.

It was named for the River Vouge, which is in fact only a stream separating the village Vougeot from Chambolle-Musigny. At , Clos de Vougeot is the largest single vineyard in C√¥te de Nuits entitled to the grand cru designation, while Corton in C√¥te de Beaune is the largest grand cru in Burgundy as a whole.  History  The Clos de Vougeot vineyard was created by Cistercian monks of C√Æteaux Abbey, the order's mother abbey. The land making up the vineyard was purchased by the Cistercians, or donated to them, from the 12th century to the early 14th century. The initial vineyard consisted of donations in 1109 to 1115. The vineyard was complete, and a wall had been built around it, by the year 1336. It served as the flagship vineyard of the Cistercians, and has been a highly recognised name for centuries. Ch√¢teau du Clos de Vougeot, situated inside the wall, was added in 1551 by rebuilding and enlarging a small chapel and some other buildings previously existing at the site. From 1945, this building has served as headquarters of the Confr√©rie des Chevaliers du Tastevin.Confr√©rie des Chevaliers du Tastevin: The Ch√¢teau du Clos de Vougeot , accessed on May 31, 2009 In the French Revolution, all vineyard possessions were taken from the church by the French state, and sold off to private buyers. In 1818, the ch√¢teau and vineyards of Clos de Vougeot was bought by Julien-Jules Ouvrard, who also bought the Roman√©e-Conti vineyard in 1819. Ouvrard later moved to Ch√¢teau de Gilly, another former Cistercian property, but continued to take in an interest in the vineyards of Clos de Vougeot, which was then a monopole. After Ouvrard's death, Clos de Vougeot passed to his three heirs, but continued to be operated as a single property until 1889, when the heirs put it up for sale. It was bought by six Burgundy wine merchants, leading to a subdivided vineyard for the first time since its creation more than 700 years earlier. After that, the holdings have been progressively subdivided by inheritance and land sales. In the early 2000s, Clos de Vougeot was split among more than 80 owners. One of the 1889 vineyard buyers, L√©once Bocquet, also bought the ch√¢teau, and initiated renovations of a part of it. In 1920, the ch√¢teau came into the hands of Etienne Camuzet, who was vineyard owner in Vosne-Roman√©e and politician. He put it to the disposal of the Confr√©rie des Chevaliers du Tastevin, and on November 29, 1944 sold it to the organisation Soci√©t√© civile des Amis du Ch√¢teau du Clos de Vougeot (\\"Friends of the Ch√¢teau du Clos de Vougeot\\"), which gave the Confr√©rie des Chevaliers du Tastevin a 99-year lease on the property.  Layout and geography of the vineyard  A view inside the vineyard The vineyard is roughly rectangular, gently sloping from a corner in the northwest down toward the south and east. The ch√¢teau is situated in this corner. Since the vineyard is large and situated in a slope, it is not homogeneous from a geological point of view. The soils have typically been a determining factor in determining the classification and extent of other Burgundy vineyards, while in this case, the wall-enclosed area has been classified in the same way. The soils of Clos de Vougeot generally considered as those giving the best wines are those surrounding the ch√¢teau in the top corner. The soils here are light chalky and gravelly soils on oolitic limestone, with good drainage. This part of the vineyard borders to the grand cru vineyards Musigny and Grands √âchezeaux. The soils of the middle part of the vineyard consist of softer limestone with clay and some gravel, and moderate drainage. Most other C√¥te de Nuits vineyards situated at this level of the slope are classified premier cru, but one part of the grand cru √âchezeaux borders on the middle part of Clos de Vougeot. The bottom part of the vineyard, situated in the east and bordering the N74, the main road of the area, consists of humus-rich alluvial clay and is almost flat, with poor drainage. This part of the vineyard borders village level vineyards in the south and partially in the east, mostly regional-level vineyards in the east, on the other side of the N74, and some Vougeot premier cru vineyards in the north. All other grand cru vineyards of the C√¥te de Nuits are situated higher up in the slope, typically in its middle part, and no other grand cru vineyard stretches down to the N74 road. Of the AOC's 50.6 ha, are in production.Burgundy Report: Clos de Vougeot, accessed on May 31, 2009  Regulations  Clos de Vougeot is an AOC for red wine produced from Pinot noir.INAO: AOC regulations for Clos de Vougeot, updated until March 26, 1998 The INAO appellation rules nevertheless allow mixing in up to 15 percent of Pinot blanc, Pinot gris or Chardonnay. In principle, wines from any still existing plantations of Renevey are also allowed, but replantation of this variety has been forbidden since 1938. The allowed base yield is 35 hectoliter per hectare. The grapes must reach a maturity corresponding to a sugar content of at least 189 grams per liter of grape must and 11.5 per cent alcohol by volume. When chaptalization is allowed, the alcohol level after chaptalization may not exceed 14.5 per cent. Wines from Clos de Vougeot are also allowed the appellation Vougeot Premier Cru, if they fail to meet the standards of the grand cru itself. The Vougeot Premier Cru regulations are slightly less restrictive when it comes to yield and grape maturity, and more importantly, also allow the production of white wine from Chardonnay and Pinot Blanc.INAO: AOC regulations for Vougeot, updated until March 26, 1998 Thus, white wine that originates from within the Clos de Vougeot vineyard can be sold as white Vougeot Premier Cru, but not under the Clos de Vougeot AOC.  Wines  A bottle of Clos de Vougeot wine. Notice the Grand Cru designation on the label. Both the geological heterogeneity of Clos de Vougeot, and the bewildering array of many small vineyard holders, contribute to making wines produced under the Clos de Vougeot AOC designation very variable in style and quality. Very fine wine of classic quality as well as very mediocre wines are produced here. The wines of Clos de Vougeot rose to fame when the Cistercians tended the entire vineyard and produced the wine. In producing Clos de Vougeot, the Cistercians first produced cuv√©es from the different parts of the vineyard, and then blended them to produce a high-class wine. Typically, wine from the top and middle parts would be used, and only sometimes would the bottom part be used for the final Clos de Vougeot wine. Wine from lower down the slope can be better in dry years, so this blending practice allowed the production of a wine that should have been consistent in quality. Since the entire area inside the wall is part of the Clos de Vougeot AOC, wines from every plot of it is entitled to the grand cru designation. Wineries which only have holdings in the lower part of the vineyard are unlikely to be able to produce wine which represents typical Burgundy grand cru quality, and it is far from certain that they will be able to match many producers' premier cru wines. However, since the grand cru designation is both a matter of pride and profitability, wines are likely to be marketed as Clos de Vougeot AOC. The best Clos de Vougeot wines, when produced in a classical style, are typically dense when young, and robust rather than elegant in style. After some ten years of cellaring, however, Clos de Vougeot wines in this style can have developed into one of the most complete C√¥te de Nuits wines, and be fully on par with wines from more consistent grand cru vineyards. Some notable producers of Clos de Vougeot wine are Domaine Leroy, Mugneret-Gibourg, M√©o- Camuzet, Anne Gros and Ren√© Engel.  In popular culture  Clos de Vougeot 1846 was the featured wine in the film Babette's Feast, which is set in 1871. \\"Clos Vougeot\\" is the preferred restorative of Miserrimus Dexter, a character in Wilkie Collins' 1875 novel, The Law and the Lady. In Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\\" (1845), Clos de Vougeot is the wine being drunk at the lunatics' feast. It is also mentioned in Poe's Bon- Bon. Clos de Vougeot makes an appearance in Dorothy Sayers' short story \\"The Bibulous Business of a Matter of Taste\\", where it is one of the wines that Lord Peter Wimsey must identify from memory. The Ch√¢teau du Clos de Vougeot is featured on a 1951 French stamp, designed and engraved by Pierre Gandon, to celebrate its 400th anniversary.

It is an apparently mindless body which three members of the St Croix family, all members of the superhero team Generation X, had been trapped in at some time. The body possesses red diamond-like skin and rarely speaks. Publication history Penance first appeared in Generation X #1 (November, 1994), and was created by Scott Lobdell and Chris Bachalo. Hollow appeared as a supporting character in Avengers Academy beginning with issue #21 (Jan 2012), making occasional appearances throughout the series. Fictional character biography =Penance/Generation-X Early years= Monet St. Croix is the sister of Marius, Claudette, and Nicole St. Croix. When her brother Marius, who would later become the mutant Emplate, first manifests his powers, the conceited Monet often verbally abused him. An enraged Emplate transforms her body into a hardened, spiked, red state and left her mute. He then tells her to \\"consider this your penance\\". Claudette, realizing how dangerous their brother is becoming, banishes him to his own pocket dimension, but he convinces Monet to accompany him, as only he can restore her true form. Nicole and Claudette, knowing Monet was their parents' favorite, decide to merge into one body with the appearance of Monet (see Monet-twins).Generation X #40 Shortly after the formation of the mutant teen team Generation X, the red-skinned Monet is dropped onto the front lawn of the Massachusetts Academy by Gateway, who speaks the single word: \\"Penance,Generation X #1\\" which is taken by witnesses to be her name. She is brought inside by headmaster Banshee, who discovers her powers as he cuts his hands by trying to pick her upGeneration X #2 As Penance cannot speak, understand English (apparently), and with an immunity to telepathy, Banshee places her in the infirmary as Banshee and Emma Frost attempt to discover her identity. Teen member M, her relation to Penance unknown, tells the adults that Penance was perhaps a prisoner of Emplate, whom the group had encountered previously and known only as a parasitic mutant who fed upon other mutants. As the team leaves, Penance awakens with one thought on her mind: survival. Perceiving the infirmary as a cell, she escapes, tearing the room apart in the process. Hearing the alarms of a breach, the team rushes to the infirmary and is amazed at the damage she caused. The team splits up to find her before she can cause further damage to the Academy. Team member Chamber, feeling a kindred spirit due to his own mutilated body, leaves the group to search for her alone. Feeling that another deformed soul would seek him out, he waited for her arrival. After Penance fights her way past the rest of the team (Husk, Synch, Jubilee, and M), she approaches Chamber, who talks telepathically to her in an attempt to convince her that he knows how she feels and eventually calms the girl down into staying with the team.Generation X #3 During her stay at the Academy, she would rarely interact with her peers, due to her animalistic nature from years of torture at Emplate's hands, and fear of being captured again. Fortunately, perhaps due to Jubilee's time with the feral mutant Wolverine, she becomes a friend to Penance, giving her the nickname \\"Penny\\". Gradually beginning to trust her friends more, Penance begins to go on missions with and assist her teammates.Generation X #8-9 However, while swimming with Jubilee one day, Penance suddenly has what resembles a seizure, falling into a mysterious coma that makes Jubilee and the others realize how little they truly know about her.Generation X Annual '95 Penance later recovers, off-panel, without explanation shortly after an attack by Omega Red.Generation X #11-12 Emplate later returns to reclaim Penance, and while she is captured with the rest of Generation X, her allegiance is momentarily unclear. Curiously enough, it is during these events that Emplate reveals he is Monet's older brother, also implying that he now realizes the twins are posing as Monet. He refers to Penance for the first time as \\"Yvette\\", although this name would eventually be retconned. Penance eventually sides with Generation X and attacks Emplate, leading to his retreat.Generation X #12-14 =The second Penance= During the events of Operation: Zero Tolerance, Generation X is attacked by Prime Sentinels in Skin's hometown of east Los Angeles. During the battle, Monet urges Synch to synch with her invulnerability to ensure his survival. In the process, he realizes that she is actually two girls, shortly before they are buried under debris. Synch rescues her, only to discover that his teammate has now split back into the unconscious forms of Nicole and Claudette.Generation X #29-31 The mystery of the twins and Monet would remain unsolved until Emplate again returned, this time working with Chimera and seeking to claim the twins. The twins recover during the battle, joining to become Monet again, and then joining with Emplate against his will to become M-Plate,Generation X #34 an entirely new being with plans of its own: namely, to journey to the Citadel of the Universal Amalgamator and force Synch to synch with the Guardian there, thereby combining all life into a single consciousness. Generation X prevents this, thanks largely to unlikely ally Dirtnap, who not only swallows M-Plate whole, but soon after explodes, restoring Emplate and the twins to their separate bodies. However, during their time as one entity, their secrets were exposed to each other, and the twins now know what truly happened to Monet. Synch is later seriously injured by two bullies, and while recovering in the hospital, he accidentally synchs with the twins, learning the truth about the twins and Monet in the process. He urges Nicole to reveal the truth to the team, which she does. But in an effort to \\"make things right\\", the twins merge once more into the form of Monet and swap places with Penance, freeing the real Monet at last, with the merged twins taking over as Penance's body.Generation X #38-40 Monet continues to operate under the twins' original codename of M, while the twins retain the identity of Penance. Both remain a part of the Generation X team, while still trying to somehow cure the still mute Penance. Notably, Penance becomes far more expressive during this period, and begins wearing everyday clothing over the black restraints she had worn since her creation.Generation X #41-46 Later, an explosion frees the twins from the Penance body, but the body would continue to function as though a mind is still inside it.Generation X #58 When the twins leave for their home, they take the now-empty Penance body with them, along with the young mutants Artie Maddicks and Leech. =The Loners= After Ricochet breaks into a building holding women being used to harvest Mutant Growth Hormone. There he meets an assassin named Delilah. During the fight, one of Ricochets discs break open a chamber and Penance emerges.The Loners #2 At first confused as to where she is, Penance tries to convince Ricochet that she isn't a threat, though he is forced to avoid her claws. Lightspeed (following Ricochet out of concern) lands between the two and uses her Kymellian powers to mesmerize Penance, but when she places her hand on Penance's shoulder, she stabs Lightspeed through her shoulders. Later, Penance encounters the rest of the group at the hospital where Julie is recovering. It is then she senses a kindred spirit in Phil Urich. She is followed by the ones intent on imprisoning her, including a mysterious woman named Fuyumi Fujikawa who calls her \\"Hollow\\". Mickey Musashi's makes a deal with the woman that allows Hollow to remain with the group, and which allows her to stay at Phil's residence.The Loners #3 While Phil is in the kitchen washing dishes. She is woken up by the sound of him smashing plates when he hallucinates an image of himself as the Green Goblin, kissing her, and tries to comfort him.The Loners #4 After an attack by Nekra, Penance witness Phil become irrational when he sees Chris and Mickey share a celebratory kiss after attack. Later, she follows Phil to Mickey's apartment.The Loners #5 After Phil steals the Darkhawk amulet, Hollow joins the other Loners in the battle between Phil, who is wearing the Darkhawk armor and Chris, who managed to summon his second Darkhawk armor. After the fight, she joins the defeated Phil who leaves the group.The Loners #6 It is still unknown who is inside the armor. =Utopia= Monet St. Croix is mentioned when her brother Emplate attacks Utopia, under her former codename.X-Men Legacy: Emplate tpb =Avengers Academy= Penance/Hollow (along with most of the members from the Loners) was seen among the new students attending the Avengers Academy.Avengers Academy #21 =Dawn of X= Claudette and Nicole St. Croix have re-appeared as members of the new mutant nation of Krakoa, they were shown at the Akademos Habitat both turned into Penance, they were being reprehended by their sister Monet.New Mutants (Vol. 4) #1 Publication history The original creative team behind Generation X, Scott Lobdell and Chris Bachalo, intended Penance to be a girl called Yvette from Yugoslavia.Generation X, Ashcan edition (1994) This was never directly revealed in the comic and links to Monet St. Croix were made by the subsequent creative team. Powers and abilities The powers of the different hosts/prisoners of the Penance form vary, but the hollow Penance form's powers are red diamond-hard skin and extended super-long razor-sharp claws on their fingers, toes, and hair follicles. Because of the density of the skin, it is quite durable, as well as resistant to psychic intrusion. Hollow also possesses animalistic agility (as she usually moves around by crouching and padding and leaping on all fours) and dexterity (as she has been shown on occasion to use her feet to grab and grip objects and people, as if they were just like her hands).

Its principal subject is interior design and landscaping, rather than pure external architecture. The magazine is published by Cond√© Nast, which also publishes international editions of Architectural Digest in China, France, Germany, India, Russia, Spain, Mexico, and Latin America. Architectural Digest is aimed at an affluent and style-conscious readership, and is subtitled \\"The International Design Authority\\". The magazine also releases the annual AD100 list, which recognizes the most influential interior designers and architects around the world. History Originally a quarterly trade directory called The Architectural Digest: A Pictorial Digest of California's Best Architecture, the magazine was launched in 1920 by John Coke Brasfield (1880‚Äì1962). Brasfield, born in Tennessee, moved to southern California in the early 1900s, where he founded the John C. Brasfield Publishing Corporation in Los Angeles. Interiors and exteriors of residences were featured in the magazine, along with floor plans. By 1963, the magazine's subtitle had been altered to A Pictorial Digest of Outstanding Architecture, Interior Design, and Landscaping, and it began publishing on a bimonthly schedule.

Each individual flower has five minute petals and eight to ten conspicuous stamens. When open, the pink-purple stamens form a globelike cluster at the tip of their leafless stalk. Yellow spores can be often be seen highlighting the tips. The globes are about across. Flowers and fruits appear from May to September. The fruit of the catclaw brier is a long, slender, rounded pod that has a covering of dense prickles, typically about long. Habitat includes disturbed areas of sandy or silty soils, roadsides, grasslands, prairies and forest margins. It is known to be very nutritious for livestock, who will seek it out. On rangeland, its absence can also be a good indicator of overgrazing. Other common names for this plant include Nuttall's sensitive briar and shame-boy, a reference to the sensitive foliage that closes upon touch. Former synonyms include Schrankia nuttallii. The species name nuttallii is in honor of Thomas Nuttall, an English botanist who lived in the United States for many years.

Based on Montgomery's play Irene O'Dare, it is set in New York City's Upper West Side and focuses on immigrant shop assistant Irene O'Dare, who is introduced to Long Island's high society when she is hired by one of its leading grande dames to help redecorate her home. The musical opened on Broadway in 1919 and ran for 675 performances, at the time the record for the longest-running musical in Broadway history, which it maintained for nearly two decades. It starred Edith Day in the title role, who repeated the role in the London production. It was revived on Broadway in 1923, filmed twice, and had a major Broadway revival in 1973, starring Debbie Reynolds, followed by a 1976 London run that lasted 974 performances. Early productions Edith Day in Irene (1919) The original Broadway production, directed by Edward Royce, opened on November 18, 1919 at the Vanderbilt Theatre, where it ran for 675 performances, at the time the record for the longest-running show in Broadway history, one it maintained for nearly two decades. The cast included Edith Day as Irene, Walter Regan as tycoon Donald Marshall, Eva Puck as Helen Cheston, Gladys Miller as Jane Gilmour, and Bobby Watson as 'Madame Lucy', a flamboyant male dress designer. The show made a star of Day, who departed the cast after five months to recreate her role at London's Empire Theatre, where it ran for 399 performances. Day was replaced in the Broadway production by Helen Shipman. Irene enjoyed a brief Broadway revival at Jolson's 59th Street Theatre in 1923 with Dale Winter as Irene, Jere Delaney as Madame Lucy, and Walter Regan reprising his role as Donald. Eventually there were 17 national touring companies, and it was filmed twice, first as a 1926 silent movie with Colleen Moore and again in 1940 with Anna Neagle. Later productions In 1971, the revival of the 1925 musical No, No, Nanette with film star Ruby Keeler proved to be a hit. Its producer, Harry Rigby, deciding to cash in on the nostalgia craze by reviving another vintage show with another glamorous movie star as its centerpiece, zeroed in on Irene, engaging Debbie Reynolds to make her Broadway debut in the title role. Rigby hired librettist Hugh Wheeler to rework the show, which retained only five of the original songs and added tunes written by McCarthy with other composers and original numbers by Charles Gaynor and Otis Clements, with additional material written by Wally Harper and Jack Lloyd for the revival. Actor John Gielgud was hired to direct. The production was troubled from the beginning. Billy De Wolfe withdrew due to illness and was replaced by George S. Irving as Madame Lucy. Reviews in Toronto were mixed, and when Reynolds was stricken with a throat ailment, the producers, rather than cancel the sell-out performances, had her mime her dialogue and songs on stage to Gielgud's reading of them from the wings, much to the dismay of angry audiences. Philadelphia critics were brutal, and Gielgud, an odd choice for a lightweight musical comedy, was replaced by Gower Champion, who had helmed a Los Angeles revival of Annie Get Your Gun with Reynolds. Peter Gennaro was hired to restage the musical numbers, and Joseph Stein was brought in to doctor the book, which now had Irene posing as a countess in cahoots with couturier Madame Lucy (the former Liam O'Dougherty) in a scheme to promote his fashions. Postponing the Broadway opening, the producers brought the work-in-progress to Washington, D.C., where it was seen by President Nixon and his family. Their declaration that Irene was a hit made headlines and spurred advance-ticket sales in New York City.Watters, Jim. \\"Unsinkable Debbie Reynolds: at 42, She Salvages Her Career\\", People Magazine, November 25, 1974, accessed December 28, 2016 After 13 previews, the revival opened on March 13, 1973 as the inaugural production of the Minskoff Theatre, where it set new box-office records. It ran for 594 performances. In addition to Reynolds and Irving (who won the Tony Award for his performance), the cast included Patsy Kelly, Monte Markham as Donald, Ruth Warrick, Janie Sell, Meg Bussert, and Reynolds' daughter Carrie Fisher. Raoul P√®ne Du Bois designed the sets and costumes, with the exception of Reynolds' costumes, which were by Irene Sharaff. The Broadway reviews were mixed, but Clive Barnes of The New York Times described it as \\"raucous, frequently cheerful, and the best 1919 musical in town.\\"Barnes, Clive. \\"Theater: Irene Bustles Merrily and Relentlessly\\", The New York Times, March 14, 1973, accessed December 28, 2016 Reynolds and Kelly were each nominated for a Tony Award; Reynolds for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical and Kelly for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical. Reynolds' former MGM co-star, Jane Powell, replaced her in February 1974. New York Times reviewer Mel Gussow wrote that \\"even though Miss Reynolds is gone, Irene survives. The two stars are an equal match for peppiness. Miss Reynolds may score a point for clowning, but Miss Powell wins two for softness.\\"Gussow, Mel. \\"Jane Powell, Soft and Smiling, Takes Over as Irene\\", The New York Times, February 8, 1974, accessed December 28, 2016 \\"I'm Always Chasing Rainbows\\", which had been cut during the pre-Broadway try-outs (although Reynolds' rendition was included in the cast album), was restored to the score. Reynolds returned to play the final week before the revival closed on September 8, 1974, and then took the show on a national tour, playing for five months and setting new box-office records before being replaced again by Powell. The success of this revival led to a 1973 Australian production with Julie Anthony, who then went on to star in a 1976 London revival at the Adelphi Theatre, directed by Freddie Carpenter and choreographed by Norman Maen, that lasted 974 performances. The cast also included Jon Pertwee and Eric Flynn.Stewart, John.

Listed at , 139 lb., she batted and threw right-handed. Ruth Williams debuted in the AAGPBL as a 20-year rookie and had a solid if unspectacular career that spanned eight seasons. Used as a spot starter and reliever, Williams collected at least ten wins in five of those seasons, while her 2.19 career earned run average ranks her twelfth in the all-time list of AAGPBL pitchers with at least 1,000 innings of work.

When she was a sophomore at East Stroudsburg University, Williams played for the New York Traders, a fastpitch softball team that paid her travel and food expenses for her to play during the weekends. After her father read about the AAGPBL in a Philadelphia Inquirer advertisement, he motivated his daughter to attend a tryout in Allentown. About 400 girls attended, and three days later she received an offer to join the league.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Williams opened 1946 with the Racine Belles, but ten days later was transferred to the Fort Wayne Daisies. She was relegated to a bench role for most of the year, pitching in just one game while striking out a batter in one inning. She was traded to the South Bend Blue Sox a year later. Meanwhile, she finished her Physical Education and General Science degrees from ESU and began teaching at Wissahickon High School in Ambler, Pennsylvania. In 1947, Blue Sox manager Chet Grant gave Williams a chance to join the pitching rotation, which included the experimented Jean Faut, Phyllis Koehn and Ruby Stephens. Williams responded with a 12‚Äì8 record and 1.70 ERA in 25 games, striking out 48 in 180 innings. Her performance slacked to a 10‚Äì10 mark and a 2.25 ERA in 1948, but she still managed to strike out 55 and collect 160 innings in 23 games.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W.

Since she was still teaching in Pennsylvania, the Blue Sox flew Williams in for the Memorial Day weekend in order to pitch. She then won two games and returned to school to finish out the school year. Williams started 1950 with South Bend, but was traded to the Peoria Redwings during the midseason and ended the year with the Kalamazoo Lassies. She combined for a 5‚Äì10 record with a 3.47 ERA in just 19 games. She did not have much run support from the Lassies and recorded losing records for the remaining three years of career by going 10‚Äì11, 10‚Äì12 and 8‚Äì12. Nevertheless, she posted low earned runs averages of 1.96, 2.48 and 2.12, pitched a career-high 174 innings in 1952, and finished ninth in ERA in 1951. Following her baseball career, Williams married Leonard Heverly and continued her work in Ambler. The couple adopted two sons, Richard and Mike, but tragedy struck in 1980 when her husband died in an unfortunate traffic collision caused by a drunk driver. She retired after the accident. Williams later attended the AAGPBL Players Association reunions. The association was largely responsible for the opening of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled in 1988 to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.

He was known as an able administrator, a conscientious teacher and a keen sportsman. At Lampeter, he worked hard to raise funds for the college He was a member of Cardiganshire County Council, a founder member of the Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society and a canon of St David's Cathedral. Academically, his most valuable publications were articles in Hastings' Dictionary of the Bible. He was examining chaplain to the Bishop of Salisbury from 1893 to 1898, and to the Bishop of St Asaph from 1898 to 1902, and was also curator of the botanical garden, Oxford, between 1896 and 1898. He married Louisa Fraser in 1886; they had four sons and three daughters including Gwyneth Bebb who campaigned to be a lawyer.

Early life and education  Lin was born in Shanghai, China. He attended Shanghai Jiaotong University, China on a tennis scholarship. Lin graduated with B.S. in electrical engineering in 1941. In 1948 he received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan. In 1956 he received the Doctor of Electrical Engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn.  Career  After graduating from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Lin worked for the Central Radio Works and Central Broadcasting Administration as an engineer. He left China in 1947 to begin his graduate work. After he earned his master's and doctorate degrees, Lin was worked at RCA Laboratories and was one of the first scientists to work on transistor circuit development. Lin was the first inventor to incorporate p-n-p or complementary integrated circuits. He later worked for CBS and Westinghouse Electric Corporation, researching and developing electrical engineering practices. In 1969, Lin began teaching at the University of Maryland. He worked at the university until his retirement in 1990. While a professor, Lin supervised and mentored 26 PhD students. He also worked part-time as an adjunct and visiting professor at the University of Pittsburgh and University of California, Berkeley, respectively. Hung C. Lin held more than 60 U.S. patents. Among his inventions is the quasi-complementary (transistor) amplifier circuit, which has been used in many commercial audio amplifiers. Another of his inventions is the lateral transistor which is used in linear integrated circuits and T2L digital integrated circuits. He also invented the wireless microphone. He has published more than 170 professional papers mostly on transistors and integrated circuits. In 1978 he was presented with the J J Ebers Award from the IEEE. In 1990, Lin was inducted into the A. James Clark School of Engineering Innovation Hall of Fame at the University of Maryland. In 2000 he was elected to be academician of Academia Sinica.

It was first released on his 1969 album with Crazy Horse, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere. Young explained the context of the story in the liner notes of his 1977 anthology album Decade, stating that he wrote \\"Down by the River,\\" \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" and \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\" while delirious in bed in Topanga Canyon with a fever. Lyrics and music The lyrics tell the story of someone who killed his lover by shooting her after feeling unable to continue from the emotional highs of their relationship. Young himself has provided multiple explanations for the lyrics. In an interview with Robert Greenfield in 1970, a year after the song was released, Young claimed that \\"there's no real murder in it. It's about blowing your thing with a chick. It's a plea, a desperate cry.\\" Later, when introducing the song in New Orleans on September 27, 1984, Young said that the song depicts a man \\"who had a lot of trouble controlling himself\\" who catches his woman cheating on him, then meets her down by the river and shoots her. According to Young, the local sheriff comes to the man's house and arrests him a few hours later. \\"Down by the River\\" begins with electric guitars followed by bass guitar and snare drum before the vocals begin. The vocal sections are taken at a slow tempo. There are long instrumental passages after each of the first two refrains, during which Young plays short, staccato notes on his guitar and incorporates distortion. The song is composed in the key of E minor. The verse follows a chord progression of Em7-A while the pre-chorus is Cmajor7-Bm-Cmajor7-Bm-C-Bm-D and the chorus is G-D-D-A. Rolling Stone critic Rob Sheffield calls \\"Down by the River\\" and \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\" the \\"key tracks\\" on Everybody Knows This is Nowhere, calling them \\"long, violent guitar jams, rambling over the nine-minute mark with no trace of virtuosity at all, just staccato guitar blasts sounding as though Young is parachuting down into the middle of the Hatfield-McCoy feud.\\" In one solo, the same staccato note is repeated 38 times. In 2015, Phish guitarist, Trey Anastasio wrote, \\"If I was ever going to teach a master class to young guitarists, the first thing I would play them is the first minute of Neil Young's original \\"Down by the River\\" solo. It's one note, but it's so melodic, and it just snarls with attitude and anger. It's like he desperately wants to connect.\\" Brett Milano of udiscovermusic.com rated Young's guitar solo as one of the 100 all-time greatest, stating that \\"it begins with almost nothing ‚Äì the pure menace of one note played again and again ‚Äì and builds to a pile of hulking riffs. Allmusic critic Bill Janovitz describes the groove as \\"lazy, almost funky,\\" stating that this helps partially obscure the \\"malevolence in its lyric.\\" However, Janovitz goes on to note that the \\"very sparseness on 'Down by the River' only acts as a haunting void for its blues, like John Lee Hooker's 'Tupelo'.\\" Personnel * Neil Young ‚Äì electric guitar, vocal * Danny Whitten ‚Äì electric guitar, backing vocal * Billy Talbot ‚Äì bass * Ralph Molina ‚Äì drums, backing vocal Performances and covers Live performances vary from shorter solo acoustic performances, as on the Crosby Stills Nash & Young release Four Way Street, to twelve minutes long, as on the Live at the Fillmore East release featuring Crazy Horse.

A CSNY performance of the song from September 1969 was included in the 1971 documentary Celebration at Big Sur. Young performed it with CSNY on the ABC TV show the Music Scene in 1969. Joey Gregorash covered this song in 1971 gaining a lot of airplay in Canada, and reaching #6 on the RPM Magazine charts. Guitarist Roy Buchanan recorded a cover version of \\"Down by the River\\" on his 1971 album Buch and the Snakestretchers, and on his 1978 album You're Not Alone.

Having led the responsible government movement in the territory during the latter days of Company rule, he was Southern Rhodesia's first head of government after it became a self- governing colony within the British Empire. Born, raised and educated in South Africa, of Irish descent, Coghlan moved to Bulawayo in 1900 to practise as a lawyer. He was elected to the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council in 1908, representing the Western electoral district. Over the next decade he supported the renewal of the British South Africa Company's royal charter to administer the Rhodesias, and opposed Southern Rhodesia's amalgamation with either Northern Rhodesia or the Union of South Africa. He led a delegation to London to discuss responsible government in 1921, and two years later Southern Rhodesia became a self-governing colony. Coghlan sat in the Legislative Assembly as Member for Bulawayo from 1924 to his death. Coghlan was buried near Cecil Rhodes's grave, at \\"World's View\\" in the Matopos Hills near Bulawayo. Early life (1863‚Äì1882) Charles Patrick John Coghlan was born on 24 June 1863 in King William's Town, British Kaffraria (part of the Cape Colony from 1866). He had three elder brothers. His father, James Coghlan, was from Ireland and was a Catholic; he had arrived in South Africa in 1851 as a private in the British Army, having enlisted to escape the Irish Potato Famine. After fighting in the Eighth Xhosa War of 1850‚Äì53 with the 2nd (The Queen's Royal) Regiment of Foot, James was stationed in the Keiskamma mountains; he settled there with his wife Isabella Mary (n√©e Maclaren), who was originally from Dumbartonshire, Scotland. They moved to King William's Town after Coghlan's discharge from the military and the birth of their first child, a boy also called James. The elder James Coghlan would become a town councillor in King William's Town. Charles Coghlan was educated at home until January 1870, when he was enrolled at the Jesuit St Aidan's College in Grahamstown. He was awarded a bursary to the South African College, Cape Town, where he studied law with the intent of becoming a barrister, but these plans were disrupted by his father's death from dysentery. Short of money, Charles quit university in 1882 and went to work for Paley and Coghlan, the law firm where his eldest brother James was a partner, in Kimberley. Kimberley (1882‚Äì1900) When Coghlan arrived to join his brother in 1882, Kimberley was a town of 22,000 in search of riches, according to John Smith Moffat. That same year, Cecil Rhodes incorporated the De Beers Mining Company and in 1883 was elected to the Cape Parliament as Member for the newly enfranchised Diamond Fields. Kimberley had come into being after diamonds were found on the De Beers brothers' farm on Colesberg Kopje in 1869. Initially dubbed \\"New Rush\\", the site was renamed after Lord Kimberley, the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, in 1873. It was respectively and from the Orange Free State and the South African Republic (or Transvaal), the latter of which had just had its independence restored following the First Boer War of 1880‚Äì81. Coghlan was admitted to practise as advocate in the courts of West Griqualand on 9 December 1886. Ten months later, after Paley's death, Coghlan and his elder brother formed the firm of Coghlan and Coghlan. Kimberley's position at the epicentre of the diamond trade led the brothers to develop expertise and a formidable reputation for their work in the mining industry. Kimberley Mine and Town, 1891 Rhodes outmanoeuvred his main opponent Barney Barnato and brought all the mines under the control of his company, De Beers, in 1888. On 30 October of that year, through the signing of the Rudd Concession by King Lobengula of Matabeleland, he obtained exclusive mining rights across all of Lobengula's territories in Matabeleland, Mashonaland and beyond for his soon- to-be-formed British South Africa Company (BSAC). Queen Victoria granted the BSAC a royal charter to administer and develop these territories on 29 October 1889, for an initial period of 25 years. This charter included the right to take possession of, deal with, and dispose of land. On 12 September 1890 Rhodes's Pioneer Column reached what was to become Salisbury. Coghlan took an active part in public debates. He was loyal to Britain, but held that all parts of the British Empire should be internally self-governing, with each territory supporting the others. Arguing that this should extend to his ancestral home of Ireland, he expressed support for the Home Rule movement there. He disapproved of the policy of the South African Republic government under Paul Kruger of conscripting uitlanders (mostly British settlers) for military service while denying them the electoral franchise. Coghlan was elected to the Kimberley town council in 1897. The following year Colonel Frederick Schermbrucker's youngest daughter Gertrude Mary Schermbrucker, described as an attractive and sociable woman, arrived to stay at the house Coghlan shared with his sister and mother. Coghlan married Gertrude in Wynberg, a southern suburb of Cape Town, on 10 January 1899. Around this time Coghlan's friend Percy Ross Frames invited him to join him in Bulawayo, one of the main settlements in Rhodesia, as Matabeleland, Mashonaland and the adjoining areas were now collectively called. Coghlan was receptive to the idea, but was compelled to stay in Kimberley by the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899. Kimberley was besieged by Boer forces, cut off by rail and telephone, from 14 October until its relief by General John French on 15 February 1900. Bulawayo (1900‚Äì1908) After a break in Cape Town, Coghlan and his wife left Kimberley for Bulawayo on 30 July 1900. There, they found the conditions to be very basic and the buildings, ramshackle. Nevertheless, the settlers enjoyed outdoor pursuits, dances and musical and theatrical performances. Coghlan and his wife lodged at the Grand Hotel. In 1901, not long after they arrived, the Coghlans' first child was born, but the baby lived only three days. A second child, a girl named Petal, was born in November 1902 and lived to old age. Coghlan gained admission to the Rhodesian bar and entered into partnership with Frames to create Frames and Coghlan. Frames left for Johannesburg in late 1902, citing the poor economic conditions in Southern Rhodesia following the Second Boer War, ending this firm. Coghlan and Allan Ross Welsh formed a new partnership, Coghlan and Welsh. The firm expanded into Salisbury as Coghlan, Welsh and Tancred in 1907 when Bernard Tancred, a South African cricketer and friend of Coghlan's from Johannesburg, joined. Shortly before the 1908 elections to the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council, Welsh sent a telegram to Coghlan, who was visiting relatives in Pietersburg, advising him to stand. Coghlan did so successfully in March 1908. Towards responsible government (1908‚Äì1922) It was widely expected that Southern Rhodesia would eventually be incorporated into the Union of South Africa as its fifth province. It was generally considered part of South Africa geographically and in colonial terms, part of the British expansion into the region that had begun with the 1820 Settlers. Representatives from Rhodesia had participated in the South African National Convention of 1908 and section 150 of the South Africa Act 1909 made specific provision for the accession of BSAC territories. Coghlan had represented the interests of the Rhodesian people at the Convention, although his contribution was insignificant. The presence of the Rhodesian delegation had been supported - and even secured - by Louis Botha, who was keen to win the trust of the settlers. In November 1909, at a banquet for Lord Selborne, the departing High Commissioner in Cape Town, Coghlan spoke of the BSAC and the people of Southern Rhodesia working together towards entering the Union, though some settlers wished to enjoy what he called \\"an artificial stage of responsible government\\" first. Indeed, the order in council of 1898 had provided Southern Rhodesia with a constitution that resembled that of a Crown Colony with responsible government and the South Africa Act made no changes to the territory's administrative framework. Botha, who had been asked by the Union's first Governor-General Viscount Gladstone to form a government, began to make policies and speeches that appeared to Coghlan to be unfair to South Africans of British origin. The Attorney-General J. B. M. Hertzog interpreted the convention in a way that Coghlan considered to be to the detriment of English- speakers. Coghlan came to the conclusion in 1910 that Southern Rhodesia's joining the Union was much further off than he had previously thought, though he still saw it as the territory's inevitable destiny, whose timing and terms the local electorate must determine. At this time, he rejected the notion of responsible government‚Äîself-government while retaining colonial status‚Äîon the grounds that he thought it would take up to two decades to achieve. He was furthermore against the idea of keeping Rhodesia for English-speaking settlers, seeing in that end the same racial discrimination he perceived the Dutch-speakers to be displaying against the British in the Union. In 1911, the partnership of Coghlan, Welsh and Tancred ended when Tancred died. Around the same time, Coghlan, who was representing a mining company, encountered Ernest Guest in opposition in a case in the court of the Mining Commissioner, who judged in favour of Guest's client. Coghlan, although irritated by Guest, recognised his ability and offered him a partnership, which he accepted, leading to the formation of Coghlan, Welsh and Guest in Salisbury in 1912. Article 33 of the BSAC charter of 1889 gave the British government the right to alter or repeal any of the administrative provisions of the charter after 25 years. So it was widely anticipated by all sections of southern African political opinion after 1910 that the BSAC's administration would come to an end in 1914. Yet the BSAC remained in place. During the course of the First World War, Rhodesia's white population was split between the Unionists, for amalgamation into the Union of South Africa, and the Responsible Government Association, for independence. While the RGA was led by Coghlan, the Union Party's leader was Herbert Longden, another lawyer from Bulawayo. Longden, like the British Government, believed Rhodesia lacked the population and resources for an independent state. For Britain, union with South Africa would mean avoiding having to buy out the BSAC, leaving the burden on South Africa instead. After the war, Coghlan noted that the new Secretary of State, Winston Churchill, was determined to achieve the amalgamation of Southern Rhodesia with South Africa. For its part, the BSAC encouraged the Unionists, expecting that it would get a better price for its assets from South Africa than from Southern Rhodesia. Other major corporations were also pro union, since South Africa would be able to provide cheap labour from the south. These interests controlled the local press and were thus highly influential in the debate. With General Smuts, a skillful statesman, also on the side of the Unionists, it seemed unlikely that Coghlan would dissuade the electorate from entering into the Union. At the 1920 elections, domestic interests aligned against those of the BSAC, rather than unreservedly in favour of responsible government. The run up to the 1922 referendum was long and acrimonious. For the Union were most of the leading citizens of Salisbury and Bulawayo, the British, South African and Rhodesian presses, the BSAC, and the British government. Against them was the Responsible Government Association, founded in 1917 by Ethel Tawse Jollie. Wallis, in his biography of Coghlan, One Man's Hand, gives him the credit for the victory of the responsible government lobby. Lewis Hastings, reviewing Wallis's book, recalls campaigning with Coghlan and says that he was the undisputed leader of the movement‚Äîhighly competent, with a clear vision, principled and sincere. He attributes Coghlan's resolve to his years in Kimberley, where he experienced the autocratic rule of the De Beers mining company, owned by the BSAC. By 1922, the display of unity by white farmers against chartered rule at the 1920 elections fell apart. The majority of them, mostly ranchers and tobacco planters, who relied on the southern market, voted for Union. On the other hand, Mashonaland maize growers, wanting to retain full share of the local produce markets, wanted responsible government. The 1922 referendum results were 8,774 for responsible government and 5,989 for joining South Africa. The role of women in the defeat of the Unionists was substantial, with approximately 75% of them voting for responsible government, even when their husbands voted for Union. In a letter to the South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts, the Company Administrator Sir Francis Drummond Chaplin cited anti- Afrikaner sentiments, particularly amongst women, as a major factor in the result. Premiership (1923‚Äì1927) Map of Southern Rhodesia c1927 showing railway lines and rivers. Before 1923, Coghlan had opposed the amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia, concerned that it would make responsible government harder to attain. One outcome of the Jameson Raid in 1895‚Äì96 had been to prevent the concentration of the BSAC into one administration. Instead, the High Commission in Bechuanaland was maintained, Northern Rhodesia kept its own administration, and Britain oversaw BSAC affairs more closely. One year into his premiership, Coghlan began to consider territorial expansion and staked a claim to northwestern Bechuanaland. The Dominions Office rejected the claim on the grounds that the Union of South Africa would respond with its own claim for the southern half of the territory. Coghlan directed his attention to Northern Rhodesia. Howard Moffat, his Minister for Mines and Works, had supervised mineral exploration in Northern Rhodesia twenty years earlier and so knew of the rich copper deposits across the Zambezi. However, Moffat's first public claim on the northern territory, in November 1925, was on the issue of control of the railway, which would grant control of the central African cattle trade. At the 1926 Imperial Conference in London, some degree of control over the railway was granted to Southern Rhodesia. There was also the issue of attracting labour for mines and farms from the far north and this gave impetus to Coghlan's and Moffat's territorial expansionism in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Coghlan called on Britain's Colonial Secretary, Leopold Amery, to give the North entirely to the South or at least the reversionary right to it but Amery refused this request. During his tour of Southern Rhodesia the following year, Amery appeared to give support to its claims to neighbouring territories. But by 1928, after Coghlan's death, both the Dominions Office and the Colonial Office were for maintaining Northern Rhodesia's territory intact, and favoured its association with the East African dependencies of Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda. Death and legacy Sir Charles Coghlan died on Sunday 28 August 1927, at the age of 64, of a cerebral haemorrhage. A solemn requiem was celebrated for him in Westminster Cathedral. He was initially buried in the Bulawayo cemetery but, following a petition from Bulawayo Town Council, Parliament consented for him to be reburied in the Matopos Hills, alongside Cecil Rhodes and Sir Starr Jameson, at a ceremony on 14 August 1930. Sir John Chancellor, the first Governor of Southern Rhodesia, after his retirement in 1928 spoke of the progress that the country had made in its first years of responsible government under the stewardship of Sir Charles Coghlan. The country's economy grew, with annual revenue increasing from ¬£1.3 million to ¬£2 million, with exports up from ¬£8.5 million to ¬£12 million, despite setbacks in the cotton and tobacco industries. The building housing Zimbabwe's Central Intelligence Organization bore the name of Sir Charles. However, in April 1985, it was changed by the office of Prime Minister Robert Mugabe to that of Chaminuka, an ancestral spirit invoked by guerrillas opposing the government of Ian Smith. Honours Coghlan was knighted in 1910 for his services to the 1908 National Convention, which led to the South Africa Act 1909 and ultimately the formation of the Union of South Africa. In 1925, the rank of KCMG was conferred on him, the warrant having been signed by his friend The Earl Buxton, Chancellor of the Order, who had served as Governor-General of South Africa from 1914 to 1920 and was president of the African Society from 1920 to 1933.

The new crown was made by Laurent Ronde, the French Crown jeweller. It originally contained a collection of Mazarin Diamonds, the Sancy diamond in the fleur-de-lis at the top of the arches, and the famous 'Regent' diamond, which was set in the front of the crown, as well as hundreds of other precious diamonds, rubies, emeralds and sapphires. All of France's about 20 crowns of the Ancient Regime, kept in the Basilica of Saint-Denis, including the one of Saint Louis and the one said of Charlemagne, were destroyed in 1793 during the French revolution. The crown of Louis XV was the only one to survive and counts, with those of the 19th century, among the only six remaining French crowns. In 1885 the French Third Republic decided to sell the Crown Jewels. Given its historic importance, the crown of Louis XV was kept, though its precious stones were replaced by glass. It is on permanent display in the Louvre museum in Paris.

She was particularly well known for her interpretations of music by Mozart. Her 1973 recital LP ' received the Grand Prix du Disque. Career Moser was born in Berlin, the daughter of the musicologist Hans Joachim Moser. She studied at the Stern Conservatory with Hermann Wei√üenborn and Gerty K√∂nig and made her debut as Kate Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly at the Deutsche Oper Berlin in 1962.

An instrumental version by pianist Roger Williams was a number 1 best-seller in the US Billboard charts of 1955. Background Kosma was a native of Hungary who was introduced to Pr√©vert in Paris. They collaborated on the song Les Feuilles mortes (\\"The Dead Leaves\\") for the 1946 film Les Portes de la nuit (Gates of the Night) where it was sung by Ir√®ne Joachim. Kosma was influenced by a piece of ballet music, \\"Rendez-vous\\" written for Roland Petit, which was itself borrowed partially from \\"Po√®me d'octobre\\" by Jules Massenet. The first commercial recordings of \\"Les Feuilles mortes\\" were released in 1950, by and by Yves Montand. Johnny Mercer wrote the English lyric and gave it the title \\"Autumn Leaves\\". Mercer was a partner in Capitol Records at the time, and Capitol recording artist Jo Stafford made the first English-language recording in July, 1950. The song was recorded steadily throughout the 1950s by leading pop vocalists including Bing Crosby (1950), Nat King Cole (1955), Doris Day (1956), and Frank Sinatra (1957). It was also quickly adopted by instrumental jazz artists including Artie Shaw (1950), Stan Getz (1952), Erroll Garner and Ahmad Jamal (separately in 1955), Duke Ellington (1957), and Cannonball Adderley and Miles Davis (together in 1958). In 2012, jazz historian Philippe Baudoin called the song \\"the most important non-American standard\\" and noted that \\"it has been recorded about 1400 times by mainstream and modern jazz musicians alone and is the eighth most-recorded tune by jazzmen.\\" Structure and chord progression The song is in AABC form.Spitzer, Peter (2001). Jazz Theory Handbook, p.81. . \\"Autumn Leaves\\" offers a popular way for beginning jazz musicians to become acquainted with jazz harmony as the chord progression consists almost solely of ii‚ÄìV‚ÄìI and ii‚ÄìV sequences which are typical of jazz. It is originally in G minor. The song's iv7‚ÄìVII7‚ÄìIIImaj7‚ÄìVImaj7‚Äìii√∏7‚ÄìV7‚Äìi chord progression is an example of the circle-of-fifths progression. : \\\\relative c' { \\\\partial 2. << ew ChordNames { \\\\set chordChanges = ##t \\\\chordmode { r2. c1:m7 f:7 bes:maj7 ees:maj7 a:m7.5- d:7 g:m} } ew Staff { \\\\tempo \\"Medium jazz\\" \\\\key g \\\\minor g'4 a bes  ees1~  ees4 f, g a  d2 d2~  d4 ees, f g  c1~  c4 d, e fis bes1 } >> } Other versions As a jazz standard, \\"Autumn Leaves\\" has accumulated more than a thousand commercial recordings.

He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling, Extreme Championship Wrestling and Impact Wrestling. Championships held by York over the course of his career include the NWA World Tag Team Championship as one-half of The Bad Street Boys with Joey Matthews. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1996‚Äì1999)= Spence trained under Cueball Carmichael and Jimmy Cicero in the IPWA Training School and had his in ring debut at the age of 19 on December 7, 1996 in Middleport, Ohio in a 30-minute Hardcore Ironman match against Joey Matthews. Adopting the name \\"Christian York\\", Spence wrestled for the Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (OMEGA), Southern Championship Wrestling, Steel City Wrestling, and numerous other independent promotions across the country. In OMEGA, York formed a stable known as the \\"Badstreet Boys\\", with Joey Matthews, as well as Shannon Moore and Shane Helms. The group had a boy band gimmick to capitalize on the bubble gum boy bands of pop culture. =National promotions (1999‚Äì2001)= Eventually, all four members of the group signed three-year contracts with Ted Turner's World Championship Wrestling (WCW) after try-outs on WCW Monday Nitro in the early summer of 1999. They stayed under contract until April 2000 when budget cuts were in order and management changed hands. York and Matthews went on to wrestle for numerous independent promotions, winning several tag team championships. In April, they went to Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF) for try- outs in Baltimore on Raw and Richmond the following night for SmackDown!. The office was impressed with their ability but asked if they could send them to Paul Heyman's Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) for more seasoning. Following that date, they were signed to contracts by ECW and aligned themselves with Tommy Dreamer, Joey Styles, and Joel Gertner. York would wrestle on the last ever match on ECW Hardcore TV in a losing effort to Jerry Lynn. After ECW declared bankruptcy in April 2001, York and Matthews were offered a contract from former employer WCW, and were written into the shows for the whole month. They then signed a three-year deal with the WWF. Upon signing the deal, they had to report to Memphis, Tennessee to work for WWF's farm league, Memphis Championship Wrestling, until being called up to the main roster. During their stay, they feuded with Eddie Fatu, Matt Anoa'i, Joey Abs, Lance Cade, Spanky, Bryan Danielson, and The Haas Brothers (Russ and Charlie). During their stay, Vince McMahon purchased WCW, upon which York and a number of development wrestlers were released. =Independent circuit (2001‚Äìpresent)= After only a few days being released, on July 20, York and Matthews returned to the independent circuit at International Wrestling Cartel losing to Evolution, the match also included the Backseat Boyz. On September 2, York and Matthews defeated the Holy Roller to become the Maryland Championship Wrestling's Tag Team Championship and would lose it in May 2002 to the Slackers. Throughout 2002 and 2003, York and Matthews appeared for Ring of Honor and Xtreme Pro Wrestling and even took on Youthanazia for the XPW World Tag Team Championship. In June 2002, they were signed to contracts by the newly formed Total Nonstop Action Wrestling promotion, after appearing on their inaugural pay-per-view against The Dupps. They were released later that year. Away from tag team wrestling, York also had some notable exposure as a singles wrestler. Between the month August and September 2002, York took part in 3PW Heavyweight Title Tournament where he would make it to the final before losing to Gary Wolfe. On July 2003, York took part in the Shane Shamrock Memorial Cup six man match which also had the MCW Cruiserweight Championship and the MEWF Cruiserweight Championship on the line. York would line the match and would also unify the two titles to become the MEWF Maryland Unified Cruiserweight Championship. In November 2002, York tore ligaments in his left ankle that kept him on the sidelines for three months. He would also have to vacate the MEWF Maryland Unified Cruiserweight Championship. York decided to get out of the wrestling business for a while to take care of life outside of wrestling after marrying his high-school sweetheart. In February 2003, York made his debut in Delaware Championship Wrestling out of Delaware. York would team with Joey Matthews winning the DCW Tag-Team Championships. Delaware Championship Wrestling would change its name to Dynamite Championship Wrestling in 2004. On July 22, 2006, however, York returned to the business to wrestle for Maryland Championship Wrestling. On December 18, 2006, York faced \\"Bone Crusher\\" Fred Sampson in a tryout dark match for WWE. York also wrestled The Miz on SmackDown and Chuck Palumbo and Carlito on WWE Heat. He was then asked to report to Louisville, Kentucky's Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), to form a team with Johnny Jeter.

Nf3 Nf6 :4. Nc3 e6 The position may readily be reached by a number of different . With Black advancing pawns to both e6 and c6, the opening resembles a mixture of the Orthodox Queen's Gambit Declined (QGD) and the Slav Defense. Black is threatening to capture the white pawn on c4, and hold it with b7‚Äìb5. White can avoid this in a number of ways. About 80% of games continue 5.Bg5 or 5.e3: the former constitutes a sharp pawn sacrifice, while the latter restricts the dark-squared bishop from its natural development to g5. Other possible moves are 5.Qb3, 5.g3 and 5.cxd5, the last of which, after 5...exd5, leads to a line of the QGD Exchange Variation where White's early Nf3 enables Black's queen bishop to freely develop, which should give equality (ECO codes D43 and D45). It is worth noting that 5.Bf4 is considered somewhat inaccurate, as 5...dxc4 is favorable for black. For the Semi-Slav the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings designates codes D43 through D49.  First moves and possible deviations  It is possible to reach the Semi-Slav through many move orders. White player may start the game with either 1.d4, 1.Nf3 or even 1.c4, keeping the possibility of a Semi-Slav open. Black player can choose different combinations of d5, c6, e6 and Nf6 as well in order to avoid certain variations or to open up some new opportunities of his own. This chapter looks at the first moves of the game from Black player's point of view, assuming that he would prefer to play the Semi-Slav. = 1. d4 d5 move order = If White opens the game with 1. d4, Black is happy to respond with 1...d5 when aiming for a Semi-Slav. Of course White can continue the game with 2. Bf4 or even 2. Bg5 (as is the case if Black opens 1...Nf6), and the game will take a completely different path. In vast majority of the games, however, White players choose to play either 2. c4 (Queens Gambit) or 2. Nf3. After 2. Nf3, the natural continuation for Black is 2...Nf6. Playing 2...c6 or 2...e6 might be somewhat inaccurate, since White always has the option of avoiding c2-c4, so developing the knight first makes a lot of sense. If White chooses the most common 2. c4, Black has three practical choices: either protect the pawn on d5 by playing e6 or c6 (keeping the option of a Semi-Slav open), or alternatively capture the white pawn with dxc4 (leading to Queen's Gambit Accepted). The first thing for Black players to consider is, what if White captures on d5 anyhow with cxd5. If Black has played the Slav move order (2...c6), then after the recapture cxd5 (\\"exchange Slav\\") the pawn structure is symmetrical. Should Black have played 2...e6 instead, the recapture exd5 leads to an imbalanced pawn structure called the Carlsbad structure, which might offer White some opportunities for a minority attack on the queenside.  Slav move order: 2...c6  Protecting the d5-pawn with the c-pawn has at least three implications for Black. First, it allows Black to keep the option to enter the Slav defence, i.e., developing his light-squared bishop to f5 at the appropriate moment, before moving his e-pawn. Second, it may discourage White from capturing on d5, given the somewhat drawish reputation of the Exchange Slav. Third, it prevents White from entering the Catalan opening with 3. g3. One drawback of playing 2...c6 is that White may continue 3. Nf3, and after 3...Nf6 play 4.e3 (\\"Slow Slav\\"), and now Black cannot really play the Semi-Slav since 4...e6 is considered to be good for White as he has not committed to Nc3 thus having other options to develop, like Nbd2 or b3 for instance.  Queen's Gambit declined move order: 2...e6  Protecting the d5-pawn with the e-pawn allows Black to develop his kingside more rapidly, but it does block the light-squared bishop for the time being. After 3. Nf3 Nf6 White has the option of entering the Catalan opening with 4. g3. If White continues 3. Nc3, Black has two options to proceed with a Semi-Slav in mind. First, Black can play 3...c6 (the \\"triangle setup\\", see below). Second, Black can play 3...Nf6, which gives White the opportunity to continue 4. cxd5 exd5 followed by 5. Bg5. = The triangle setup = After the move order 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 black has the opportunity to respond with 3...e6 instead of 3...Nf6. This \\"triangle setup\\" opens up some new alternatives for both players on the fourth move.  Marshall Gambit  First, White has the opportunity to enter the Marshall Gambit by playing 4. e4. Play continues 4...dxe4 (4...Bb4 is sometimes played, but should favor White) 5. Nxe4 Bb4+. Now White has two alternative paths to continue. The main line is considered to be 6. Bd2 Qxd4 7. Bxb4 Qxe4+ and then White blocks the check with either his knight or bishop. Alternatively White can continue with 6. Nc3 (as in World Championship match Carlsen-Anand, 2013), and play continues 6...c5 7.a3 Ba5.  Noteboom variation  Second, if White continues 4. Nf3, Black has the extra option of playing 4...dxc4 entering the Noteboom variation. If White wants to avoid this variation, he must play either 4. e4 (Marshall Gambit) or 4. e3 (which usually transposes to the Meran, but deprives White of the Bg5 variations). White now has a number of possible continuations, including 5. a4 (see below), 5. e3 (often transposing to the line given below), 5. e4 (with similarities to the line given below), or even 5. Bg5. A typical line in the Noteboom variation continues: 5. a4 Bb4 6. e3 b5 7. Bd2 a5 8. axb5 Bxc3 9. Bxc3 cxb5 10. b3 Bb7 11. bxc4 b4 12. Bb2 Nf6 13. Bd3 Nbd7 14. 0-0 0-0 with an interesting position where Black has two connected passed pawns on the queenside, while White has the bishop pair and dominates the center of the board. It is worth noting, that the \\"triangle setup\\" is not ideal for Black if White plays 3. Nf3 instead of 3. Nc3. Should Black play 3...e6 nevertheless, White has the option of continuing with 4. e3 or 4. Qc2, for example, thus avoiding the Noteboom variation. = 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 move order = Black has the option of delaying the move d7-d5, for instance to avoid the exchange cxd5. If White continues 3. Nc3, Black has the option of transposing to a Nimzo-Indian with 3...Bb4. Should White choose to play 3. Nf3 instead, Black can simply play 3...d5, and then after 4. Nc3 c6 we are back at the start of Semi-Slav. This move order, however, allows white to play the Catalan Opening with either 3. g3, or alternatively 3. Nf3 d5 4. g3.  Semi-Slav: 5.e3 variations  Roughly 50% of the games continue with 5.e3. White gives priority to developing his light-squared bishop, and accepts that for the time being the dark-squared bishop will remain somewhat out of play. The main line continues with 5...Nbd7. The bishop moves 5...Bd6 and 5...Be7 are seldom seen, as masters realized early on that at e7, the bishop was passively placed and does nothing to further one of Black's aims, the freeing move ...e5. The unusual move 5...a6 is considered solid for Black. Some sources call 5...a6 the \\"accelerated Meran\\".https://www.365chess.com/eco/D45_Queen's_Gambit_Declined_semi- Slav_accelerated_Meran_(Alekhine_variation) =Meran Variation: 6.Bd3 = One of the main variations of the Semi-Slav is the Meran Variation. White plays 6. Bd3, provoking the continuation 6... dxc4 7. Bxc4 b5 (ECO codes D46 to D49) where black surrenders his center in exchange for queenside expansion and some tempi against the white bishop. The line was first played in 1906 in the game Schlechter‚ÄìPerlis.http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessopening?eco=D48 The variation takes its name from the town of Meran (Merano) in northern Italy. During a 1924 tournament in Meran, it was used successfully in the game Gruenfeld‚ÄìRubinstein. Gruenfeld adopted the same variation two rounds later against Spielmann, winning as well.\\"An Opening Created in 1924 Still Leads to Complex Battles\\" New York Times , 29 January 2006 White will play in the center, leading to a rich, complicated game. These opposing strategies, with the ensuing keen play, have long made the Meran a favorite for enterprising players of either color. An example is Gligoric v Ljubojevic, Belgrade, 1979.Gligoric v Ljubojevic, Belgrade, 1979 Though appearing in contemporary master play with less frequency than the Meran, there are other possibilities: 6...Be7, 6...Bb4, introduced by the Italian master Max Romih, and 6...Bd6, which was much the most popular line before the debut of the Meran, and espoused by the American grandmaster Arthur Bisguier throughout his career. After the main line 6. Bd3 dxc4 7. Bxc4 b5 white has three alternative retreats for the bishop. Vast majority of games continue 8. Bd3, but the moves 8. Bb3 and 8. Be2 are possible as well.  8. Bd3 variation (main line)  By playing 8. Bd3 white returns the bishop on this ideal square, where it supports white's strategic ambition of pushing e3-e4 in the near future, and gives White the option of playing Ne4 if necessary. Black's main plan, on the other hand, is to find a way to push c6-c5 in order to free the long diagonal for his light-squared bishop and to get rid of the backward pawn on the semi- open c-file. In practice, black has three alternative moves in this position: 8...a6 (Classical Meran), 8...Bb7 (\\"Modern/Improved Meran\\"http://www.chess.com/article/view/larsenrsquos-improved-meran-the-great- dane-deigns-to-allow-check) or 8...Bd6 (which often transposes to the lines of Anti-Meran).  8. Bb3 variation  Maintaining the bishop on the long diagonal aiming at e6 and f7 squares is an aggressive approach by white. If black is not careful, white will launch an aggressive attack towards the black king with possible knight sacrifices on e6 or f7 in the near future. An example continuation might be 8...b4 9. Ne2 Bb7 10. Nf4 Bd6 11. Ng5, when white is already threatening sacrifices to open up black's position, and black must respond with 11...Bxf4 in order not to end up in trouble.  8. Be2 variation  Retreating the bishop to e2 instead of the typical d3-square has an impact on certain continuations, when the white queen is protecting the d-pawn. An example can be seen in a line where black plays in the typical Meran style: 8. Be2 a6 9. e4 c5 10. e5 cxd4 and now white has the option of playing 11. Qxd4 Bc5 12. Qf4 with a comfortable advantage. = Classical Meran: 8...a6 = Black plays the move 8...a6 in order to protect his b5-pawn and threatening to follow up with the equalizing move c6-c5. White cannot really prevent this plan directly, so he must immediately generate some counterplay in the center with 9. e4. It is possible to play also 9. a4, but the move 9.0-0 is a strategic mistake as it allows black to freely push his c-pawn which equalizes the game immediately. Black will respond with 9...c5, after which White has the choice between pushing his d-pawn or e-pawn, leading to very different middlegames.  10. e5 variation (main line)  Pushing the e-pawn is the classical approach by white, adopted in several high level games, including World Championship match Kramnink-Anand in 2008. The black knight on f6 has no reasonable squares to go to, so black must continue his aggression by 10...cxd4, attacking the white knight in return. Taking the knight on f6 would favor black, so White responds 11. Nxb5, sacrificing his knight while still threatening Black's f6-knight. Black now has three reasonable alternatives how to proceed. Most popular and tested line continues 11...axb5 12. exf6 gxf6 13. 0-0 Qb6 14. Qe2 with a very interesting position. Black is up a pawn and has a very straightforward plan: play Bb7, Bd6 Rb8 and aim for the white king. Practice has shown, however, that white is doing very well in these positions, but precision is certainly required from both sides. Alternatively, Black can play 11...Ng4, where White might respond 12. Qa4, preventing the capture axb5 due to the pin on the a-file, as well as discouraging Black from capturing on e5 due to the discovered check on the black king. Nevertheless, play might continue 12...Ngxe5 13. Nxe5 Nxe5 14. Nd6+ Ke7 15. Nxc8+ Rxc8 16. Bxa6 Ra8 and white is clearly better but certainly not yet winning. A third alternative is to play 11...Nxe5, and after 12. Nxe5 axb5 13. Bxb5+ Bd7 14. Nxd7 Qa5+ 15. Bd2 Qxb5 16. Nxf8 Kxf8 White probably has a slight advantage but the imbalance in pawn structures will guarantee an exciting game with opportunities for both sides.  10. d5 variation (transposition to Reynolds Attack)  White has the option of playing 10. d5 as well. This often transposes to the so called \\"Reynolds attack\\" (described in detail below) after, for example, the moves 10...c4 11. Bc2 Qc7 12. 0-0 Bb7, or some other move order. = Modern/Improved Meran: 8...Bb7 = According to some sources, the move was first played in 1923. The strategic idea behind this move is to develop the light-squared bishop and possibly play b5-b4 and c6-c5 without wasting time on a7-a6. The move 8...Bb7 was long considered virtually unplayable due to the line 9. e4 b4 10. Na4 c5 11. e5 Nd5 12. Nxc5 Nxc5 13. dxc5 Bxc5 14. Bb5+ and the black king will be stuck in the center. However, it was later found, in particular through the work of Danish grandmaster Bent Larsen in late 1960s and early 1970s, that after 14...Ke7 black is completely fine and might be even better, with a very strong knight on d5 and strong bishops aiming at the white kingside. This forced white players to look for alternative approaches to black's modern treatment of the Meran.  9. 0-0 variation and Reynolds Attack  White can simply play 9. 0-0, and the game often continues 9...a6 10. e4 c5 11.d5 leading into the so called \\"Reynolds Attack\\". It is worth noting that 11.e5 is no longer an option as it was in the Classical Meran, since black can respond with 11...cxd4 and now 12. Nxb5 no longer works since black has the option of playing 12...Bxf3 13. Qxf3 Nd5 and the game is very much equal. After 11. d5 black cannot really capture on d5, since the opening of the e-file could be disastrous for black in a practical game (although with precise computer play black seems to be fine after 11...exd5). Therefore black must allow white to capture on e6, and try to deal with the consequences. Black's typically develops his queen with Qc7, and he has a choice of whether or not to push the c-pawn to c4. The benefit of pushing the c-pawn is that should white capture play dxe6 and after the recapture fxe6 attack the e-pawn with either Ng5 or Nd4, black has the opportunity to defend the pawn with Nc5. Alternatively black can refrain from pushing the c-pawn to c4, which prevents white from using the d4-square for his knight in some variations. An example variation where black keeps his c-pawn on c5 goes like this: 11...Qc7 12. dxe6 fxe6 13. Ng5 Qc6 after which there are many different ways to continue for both sides. If Black instead pushes his c-pawn, this opens up several interesting opportunities for white. For example: 11...c4 12. Bc2 Qc7 13. dxe6 fxe6 and now White has two possible knight moves (among other alternatives) to put pressure on the black e-pawn. First, 14. Ng5 has to be met with 14...Nc5 (now 14...Qc6 would lead to 15. Qf3 h6 16. Qh3 - a typical queen maneuver in such positions - with a very strong advantage for White). Now White has a couple of interesting alternatives to proceed. First one is a flashy move 15. e5, played for example in 1994 by Kramnik against Shirov, and a couple of rounds later by Karpov against Kramnik himself. Play continues 15...Qxe5 16. Re1 Qd6 17. Qxd6 Bxd6 18. Be3 0-0 19. Rad1 Be7 20. Bxc5 Bxc5 21. Nxe6 Rfc8 with roughly equal chances for both. An alternative approach is to play 15. Be3 h6, after which White can throw in the even more flashy knight sacrifice 16. Nxe6, and the game typically continues 16...Nxe6 17.e5 Qxe5 18. Bg6+ (the point!) Ke7 19. Re1 and White has a strong attack against the black king, despite being a full piece down. Second, 14. Nd4 Nc5 15. Qe2 Bd6 leads to very interesting play, like for example in a game Karpov-Anand, 1998, where the game continued 16. f4 e5 17. Ndxb5 axb5 18. Nxb5 Qb6 19. Nxd6+ Qxd6 20. fxe5 Qxe5 21. Rf5 Qe7 22. Qxc4 Rc8 23. Qb5+ Ncd7 24. Qxb7 Rxc2 with a wild and tactical game. A lot of theory and high-level games exist on Reynolds Attack and it's different subvariations. As in many variations of the Semi-Slav, the game gets wildly tactical and provides opportunities for both sides.  9. e4 variation  Continuing the game with 9. e4 b4 10. Na4 c5 11. e5 Nd5 is still very much an option for white. Instead of captures on c5, white can play 12. 0-0 with some attacking prospects. The most critical continuation is 12...cxd4, after which white can either play 13. Re1 or 13. Nxd4, both giving opportunity for some wild attacks on the black position. With accurate play, however, black should be fine.  9. a3 variation  White has a third option to play 9. a3 as well. The idea is to prepare b2-b4 by white, which would make it more difficult for black to achieve his strategic plan of pushing c6-c5. Black may respond with moves like 9...b4, 9...Bd6, 9...a6 or 9...a5. = 8...Bd6 variation = Intent of the move 8...Bd6 is to allow rapid castling as well as to increase black's control over the e5-square, which will be critical in many continuations. White's strategic idea in the Meran is to push e3-e4, and with a bishop on d6 Black is always ready to meet this with e6-e5, and typically Black is doing fine after such moves. Play might continue 9. 0-0 0-0 10. Qc2 Bb7 transposing to one of the topical lines discussed in the Anti-Meran section below. In addition there are some independent lines after 8...Bd6, where play continues with, for example, either 9. Ng5 Bb7 10. Qf3 h6 11. Qh3 or 9. Bd2 Bb7 10. Rc1 Rc8 11. a3. =Anti-Meran Variation: 6.Qc2 = The main alternative to 6.Bd3 has become 6.Qc2, once a sideline, this move exploded in popularity in the 1990s, in large part due to Anatoly Karpov's advocacy. The idea is to wait for Black to commit to ...dxc4 before playing Bd3. Black commonly replies with 6...Bd6 and now White can choose between a couple of very different continuations: Karpov Variation: 7.Bd3  Most often white players choose the move 7. Bd3. Karpov first played 7.Be2 but it soon transpired that the d3-square gives White better chances. Play usually continues 7...dxc4 8. Bxc4 0-0 9. 0-0 b5 10. Bd3 Bb7, after which white has several interesting options to continue the game. = 11. a3 variation = One of the \\"hot\\" positions of Semi-Slav occurs after 11. a3. White intends to simply push b2-b4, which would seriously hamper black's strategic plan of playing c6-c5. White also often looks at transferring his knight from f3 via g5 to e4, which is something black might want to prevent. Black players have tried various approaches to combat white's plan, and the final word on this variation has certainly not been said yet. If black responds with 11...a5, he is certainly slowing down white's intentions towards b4, but the cost may be too high: black will never be able to support his b-pawn with a6, and the weakness of the queenside pawn structure will be a permanent problem for black. An alternative is to play 11...a6 aiming at pushing c5 next, which more or less invites white to play 12. b4. Now black can respond with 12...a5, and the game could continue with 13. Rb1 axb4 14. axb4 Qe7 15. e4 e5 with very dynamic play and opportunities for both sides. Playing 11...Qe7 takes the poison out of white's planned knight transfer, since after the moves 12. Ng5 h6 13. Nge4 Nxe4 14. Nxe4 c5 black seems to be fine. However, after 11...Qe7, white can continue 12. e4 e5 13. Bg5 and white seems to retain some advantage. A very radical approach by black is to play 11...Rc8, with a clear threat of placing the rook on the same file as the white queen. If white now plays 12. b4 to \\"prevent\\" black from pushing the c-pawn, black may simply respond with 12...c5!? (12...a5 is the computer preference), and after 13. bxc5 Bxf3 14. cxd6 Nd5 the game is wide open with massive tactical complications and opportunities for both sides. = 11. Rd1 variation = Playing 11. Rd1 is a possibility, but it looks like black can neutralize white's play after 11...b4 12. Na4 c5 13. dxc5 Rc8 and the tactics seem to work in black's favor. = 11. e4 variation = White can immediately push 11.e4, and black must respond with the thematic 11...e5. Play often continues 12. dxe5 Nxe5 13. Nxe5 Bxe5 14. h3 with some slight advantage for white. = 11. Ng5 variation = White can begin the thematic knight transfer immediately with 11. Ng5. In such positions, black often has the tactical idea of Bxh2+ Kxh2 Ng4+ at his disposal, but in this precise variation it does not seem to provide anything for black. After 11...h6 12. Nge4 Be7 the position seems very equal, though.  7. b3 variation  Instead of preparing the e3-e4 push to free his dark-squared bishop, white can also play 7. b3 to support the pawn on c4 and develop the bishop on the long diagonal in anticipation of future opening of the center. Play might continue 7...0-0 8. Be2 after which black has several viable continuations at his disposal. Shirov‚ÄìShabalov Gambit: 7.g4  Another increasingly common gambit line used in the Anti-Meran is the sharp 7.g4. Popularized by Alexander Shabalov and Alexey Shirov, the gambit destabilizes the center for Black and has been successful for several grandmasters, including Kasparov, who won the first game of his 2003 match against the computer chess program Deep Junior with it.Kasparov vs. Deep Junior, Game 1 If black simply takes the pawn with 7...Nxg4, white will respond with 8. Rg1. Black now has a number of playable continuations, including Qf6, Nxh2, f5, h5 and Nh6, and with precise play black should be fine. An alternative to taking the pawn is to simply stop it by playing 7...h6. White will continue with 8. Rg1 anyhow, but black has a number of playable responses. Another popular response is to play 7...dxc4, but after 8. Bxc4 it seems that white will retain a slight advantage. Play might continue, for example, with 8...e5 9. g5 Nd5 10. Ne4 Semi-Slav: 5.Bg5 variations The Anti-Meran Gambit (ECO code D44) arises after 5.Bg5. White refuses to shut in the dark-squared bishop, instead developing it to an active square where it pins the black knight. The downsides of this choice are that it does not help developing White's kingside, and the pawn of c4 remains unprotected. In some cases, such as the Cambridge Springs Defence (see below), Black aims to benefit from the slight dark square weaknesses left behind on the queenside after the bishop has moved outside the pawn chain. Main Black replies are (in order of frequency in high-level games): 5...h6 (immediately questioning the white bishop's intentions, leading to Moscow/Anti-Moscow variations), 5...Nbd7 (transposing to the Cambridge Springs Defence), 5...dxc4 (triggering the ultra-sharp Botvinnik variation) or 5...Be7 (transposing to the Orthodox Defense of the Queen's Gambit Declined). =Moscow Variation: 5...h6 6. Bxf6 Qxf6 = The Moscow Variation 5... h6 6. Bxf6 Qxf6 gives rise to play of a very different character from the Botvinnik or Anti-Moscow variations. Black has the bishop pair, which gives him good long-term chances, but must avoid prematurely opening the position in the face of White's superior development and central control, as his position is initially solid but passive. Alexei Dreev, for example, has played this line successfully as Black. Play might continue like this: 7. e3 Nd7 8. Bd3 dxc4 (white was threatening to play e3-e4-e5) 9. Bxc4 g6 (9...Bd6 is also possible) 10. 0-0 Bg7 and now there are various ways to continue the game for both sides. Black has the bishop pair and no immediate structural weaknesses, but his pieces are still a bit undeveloped, especially the light-squared bishop. White might continue with a queenside expansion, for example 11. b4 0-0 12. a4 with a lively game to follow. An alternative approach is one introduced in a game Carlsen-Karjakin (2009), where white continued with the thematic 11. e4 e5 12. d5 Nb6 13. Bb3 Bg4. This allows Black to inflict doubled pawns for White, but it seems that White is able to get a lot of play against Black's weak c-pawn. The game continued: 14. Rc1 0-0 15. h3 Bxf3 16. Qxf3 Qxf3 17. gxf3 Rfd8 18. Rfd1 Bf6 19. dxc6 bxc6 20. Rxd8+ Rxd8 21. Nd1 and White seems to have a slight advantage. In order to avoid the continuations above, Black can also play 7... g6 instead. This makes White's typical plan of e3-e4-e5 a bit less attractive (an example line could be: 8. Bd3 Bg7 9. e4 0-0 10. 0-0 Qd8 11. e5 dxc4 12. Bxc4 c5 challenging White's center). One alternative approach was introduced in a game Kramnik-Topalov (2014 candidates), where the game continued 8. Bd3 Bg7 9. 0-0 0-0 10. Ne5. This could be a strong square for the knight, since Black cannot really challenge it with a move f7-f6, given the weaknesses of the kingside pawns. Game continued 10...c5 11. cxd5 cxd4 12. exd4 exd5 13. Re1 Be6 14. Bb5 restricting the black knight and good position for White. = Anti-Moscow Variation: 5...h6 6. Bh4 dxc4 = Instead of the more calm and positional 6, Bxf6, white has the option of retreating the bishop with 6. Bh4. This allows black to capture and keep the c4-pawn, but in return offers white a lot of active play against black's weakened pawn structure and vulnerable king. The game typically continues 6...dxc4 7. e4 (note: 7. a4 to prevent black's b5 does not work, see below) g5 8. Bg3 b5 and black has been able to defend the pawn on c4, but his position is full of weaknesses for white to attack. The Anti-Moscow variation leads to very complicated game, similar to Botvinnink variation in many ways. Note: In such positions White often considers pushing a2-a4 to prevent Black from defending the c4-pawn with b5. In this particular case, 7. a4 is a mistake. First, Black can play 7...b5 anyway, with the idea that 8. axb5 cxb5 9. Nxb5 Qb6 10. Na3 Qxb2 is very good for Black (there are some other variations, including taking Bxf6 at some point, but Black is better in any case). Second, Black can play 7...Bb4, followed up by b5 and Black is a pawn up and it is difficult to believe White has enough compensation. White has a number of typical plans to attack the black position all over the board. On the kingside, White can consider the move h2-h4, possibly further weakening Black's kingside pawn structure. In the center, White often plays Ne5 and opens up the d1-h5 -diagonal for his queen and bishop, as well as looks for opportunities to break through with d4-d5. It is worth mentioning that pushing the e-pawn to e5 is often not a good idea, since it blocks the white minor pieces. On the queenside, White often plays moves like a2-a4 and b2-b3 to undermine the black pawn structure. All of this is combined with the fact that black king has no strong shelter to hide, so a constant threat of mating attacks hangs in the air. White typically continues 9. Be2, and Black responds with 9...Bb7. This is an important prophylactic move by Black, as White is constantly threatening to push d4-d5 to break through in the center. White now has the option of playing either 10. h4 or 10. 0-0. A typical line after the former is 10. h4 g4 11. Ne5 h5 12. 0-0 Nbd7, 13. Qc2 Nxe5 14. Bxe5 Bg7 with various possible continuations and possibly still a slight advantage for White. The latter often leads to wild complications after 10. 0-0 Nbd7 11. Ne5 Bg7, and now White can choose between two very different continuations. First one is 12. Nxd7, which typically continues 12...Nxd7 13. Bd6 a6 14. a4 e5 and so on. The second one, first seen in 2008 in a game between Topalov and Kramnik, is the flashy 12. Nxf7 (a full piece sacrifice), which leads to a wild attack after 12...Kxf7 13. e5 Nd5 14. Ne4 Ke7 15. Nd6 Qb6 16. Bg4 and White has a great position, strong knight on d6, control over the center and the light squares, and pressure against the weak e6 pawn. Although Black might be objectively able to survive and even convert his material advantage to a win, the complications are huge and whoever is better prepared to deal with the position has certainly the upper hand in practical games. = Botvinnik Variation: 5...dxc4 = The Botvinnik variation is probably one of the most complicated of all chess openings, with theory stretching past move thirty in some variations. The opening was introduced by Mikhail Botvinnik in the 1945 USSR vs USA radio match vs Arnold Denker. Today, Alex Yermolinsky has an excellent record with the white pieces and Alexei Shirov has been Black's chief proponent in this variation. Although this variation bears Botvinnik's name, he was not the first person known to have played it‚ÄîKlaus Junge is credited as the actual inventor.Igor ≈†tohl, Chessbase Tutorials Volume 3 Black makes the thematic pawn capture 5...dxc4 immediately. White takes control of the center with 6.e4 as Black defends his extra pawn with 6...b5. The main line of the Botvinnik now continues 7. e5 h6 8. Bh4 g5 9. Nxg5 hxg5 (9...Nd5 is sometimes played, and after 10. Nxf7 Qxh4 11. Nxh8 Bb4 12. Rc1 White is objectively much better, but the position is incredibly complex to play in practice for both sides) 10. Bxg5 Nbd7 (10...Be7 11. exf6 Bxf6 12. Bxf6 Qxf6 13. g3 should be favorable for White). White will regain his piece with interest, emerging with an extra pawn, but Black will soon complete his development, gaining great dynamic compensation, whereas White's task is rather more difficult. White will fianchetto his king bishop and castle kingside, while Black will play c5, Qb6, castle queenside, and can carry out an attack in the center or on either flank, leading to complex play. The main continuation is 11. g3, aiming to quickly take control of the long diagonal. White can also play 11. exf6, but after 11...Bb7 12. g3 c5 13. d5 White has given Black some additional options compared to the main move, such as Nb6, Ne5, Qc7 or Bh6, which was not necessary. The 11. g3 move order does, however, open up the possibility of 11...Rg8, and play might continue 12. h4 Rxg5 13. hxg5 Nd5 14. g6 fxg6 15. Qg4 Qe7 16. Bg2 with a slight advantage for White. The main continuation is 11...Bb7 12. Bg2 Qb6 13. exf6 0-0-0 14. 0-0 c5 15. d5 b4 and we have reached one of the key positions of the Botvinnik variation. White now has two main continuations: 16. Na4 and 16. Rb1.  16. Na4 variation  The most challenging continuation is 16. Na4, where Black has two main replies. The first one, although not the best one, is 16...Qa6, leading to another crazy and forcing continuation: 17. a3 Bxd5 18. Bxd5 Ne5 19. axb4 Rxd5 20. Qe2 cxb4 21. Nc3. The second one and probably the better one, is 16...Qb5, after which play might continue with multiple forcing moves 17. a3 Nb8 18. axb4 cxb4 19. Qg4 Bxd5 20. Rfc1 Nc6 21. Bxd5 Rxd5 22. Rxc4 Rxg5 23. Qd4 Kb8 24. Rxc6 Rxg3+ 25. fxg3 Qxc6 26. Rd1 Qc7 and so on.  16. Rb1 variation  With this somewhat odd-looking move White actually prevents Black from capturing the c3-knight (16...bxc3 17. bxc3 Qa6 18. Rxb7 followed up by 19. dxe6 would be completely winning for White). Black would respond 16...Qa6 and play typically continues in a completely bizarre Botvinnik fashion: 17. dxe6 Bxg2 18. e7 Bxf1 and now either 19. Kxf1 or 19. Qd5 and so on. These positions are highly dynamic and favor first and foremost the better prepared player, although objectively speaking White might have a slight advantage. = Cambridge Springs Variation: 5...Nbd7 6. e3 Qa5 = Black breaks the pin on the h4‚Äìd8 diagonal and forms a pin of his own on the c3-knight (exploiting the absence of the White's queen bishop from the queenside). If Black later plays dxc4, there may be threats against the g5-bishop. = Orthodox Defence: 5...Be7 = Breaking the pin with 5...Be7 transposes to the lines of Orthodox Defence of the Queen's Gambit Declined. This move is, however, less challenging for white, at least judging by the fact that white scores more than 70% in top-level games. An example continuation is 6. e3 Nbd7 7. Qc2 0-0 8. Rd1 and white has a comfortable position.  Semi-Slav: 5th move alternatives  Although more than 90% of games continue with either 5. Bg5 or 5. e3, there are some sidelines that are worth a quick look. = 5. Qb3 variation = The move 5. Qb3 is an alternative way of protecting the c-pawn. If Black continues with the typical 5...Nbd7, White can play 6. Bg5 and this is supposed to lead to a favorable version of a Queen's Gambit Declined. If Black plays 5...dxc4 instead, White will recapture with 6. Qxc4 (see below). = 5. Qd3 variation = The move 5. Qd3 is often combined with the idea of pushing e2-e4 in the near future. If Black continues in a typical Semi-Slav fashion with 5...Nbd7, then White can immediately play 6. e4, and after 6...dxe4 7. Nxe4 Nxe4 8. Qxe4 Bb4+ 9. Bd2 Bxd2+ 10. Nxd2 the game is pretty much even. White also has the option of playing 6. g3, leading to some sort of Catalan setup. If Black plays 5...dxc4 instead, White will recapture with 6. Qxc4 (see below). = 5. Qb3/d3 dxc4 6. Qxc4 variation = After either queen move, Black can continue in Semi-Slav style by capturing the white pawn with 5...dxc4. Play will continue 6. Qxc4 b5, and now White can retreat his queen back to either b3 or d3. After 7. Qb3, the game might continue 7...Nbd7 8. Bg5 Be7 9. e3 with equal opportunities. The move 7. Qd3 is an alternative, and Black's best reply is considered to be 7...a6 8. e4 c5 and Black is supposed to be fine after either 9. dxc5 or 9. e5. = 5. g3 variation = By playing 5. g3, White makes a claim that he's ready to play the Catalan, with the black pawn a bit passively on c6. This practically forces Black to take the c-pawn with 5...dxc4. White will continue 6. Bg2 (6. a4 c5 is supposed to be good for Black), and Black has now two main choices. First, he can play 6...b5, and the game might continue in Catalan style with 7. Ne5 a6 8. a4 (8. Nxc6 Qb6 is fine for black) Bb7 and so on. Second, he can play 6...Nbd7 preventing white's Ne5, which might lead to 7. 0-0 Be7 8. e4 0-0. = 5. Bf4 variation = Developing the bishop to f4 might seem reasonable at first, but in this particular opening it is not the correct approach by White. After 5. Bf4 Black responds thematically 5...dxc4 (anything else is good for White), and is ready to defend the c-pawn with the standard push b7-b5. White's best attempt might be to continue 6. a4, but Black now has the move 6...Nd5 (since the knight is not pinned by the white bishop as it would be in the standard Bg5 lines). White's best continuation is probably 7. Bg5, underlining the fact that this is where the bishop should have gone in the first place. After 7...Be7 8. Bxe7 Qxe7 Black is probably slightly better. If White plays 6. e4 as he would in a Botvinnik variation with the bishop on g5, Black simply responds 6...b5 and this must be a much better version of the Botvinnik for Black since White lacks the usual counterplay with e4-e5 against the pinned knight. Finally, the same logic applies for 6. e3 b5, and white cannot claim having enough dynamic compensation for the pawn.

The procedure is performed to induce abortion, as a treatment for incomplete miscarriage or retained pregnancy tissue, or to obtain a sample of uterine lining (endometrial biopsy). It is generally safe and serious complications rarely occur. Some sources may use the terms dilation and evacuation or \\"suction\\" dilation and curettage to refer to vacuum aspiration, although those terms are normally used to refer to distinct procedures. History Vacuuming as a means of removing the uterine contents, rather than the previous use of a hard metal curette, was pioneered in 1958 by Drs Wu Yuantai and Wu Xianzhen in China, but their paper was only translated into English on the fiftieth anniversary of the study that \\"ultimately led to the technique becoming the world‚Äôs most common and safest obstetric procedure\\". In Canada, the method was pioneered and improved on by Henry Morgentaler, achieving a complication rate of 0.48% and no deaths in over 5,000 cases. He was the first doctor in North America to use the technique, which he trained other doctors to use. Dorothea Kerslake introduced the method into the United Kingdom in 1967 and published a study in the United States that further spread the technique. Harvey Karman in the United States refined the technique in the early 1970s with the development of the Karman cannula, a soft, flexible cannula that avoided the need for initial cervical dilatation and so reduced the risks of puncturing the uterus. Clinical uses Vacuum aspiration may be used as a method of induced abortion, as a therapeutic procedure after miscarriage, to aid in menstrual regulation, and to obtain a sample for endometrial biopsy., which cites: :: It is also used to terminate molar pregnancy. When used as a miscarriage treatment or an abortion method, vacuum aspiration may be used alone or with cervical dilation anytime in the first trimester (up to 12 weeks gestational age). For more advanced pregnancies, vacuum aspiration may be used as one step in a dilation and evacuation procedure.Baird (2001), pp. 4-5,14 (sidebars and information box). Vacuum aspiration is the procedure used for almost all first-trimester abortions in many countries. Procedure A diagram of a vacuum aspiration abortion procedure at 8 weeks gestation. 1: Amniotic sac 2: Embryo 3: Uterine lining 4: Speculum 5: Vacurette 6: Attached to a suction pump Figure I is before aspiration of amniotic sac and embryo, and Figure II is after aspiration with the instrument still inside the uterus. Vacuum aspiration is an outpatient procedure that generally involves a clinic visit of several hours.Baird (2001), p. 10 (table). The procedure itself typically takes less than 15 minutes. Suction is created with either an electric pump (electric vacuum aspiration or EVA) or a manual pump (manual vacuum aspiration or MVA). A hand-held 25cc or 50cc syringe can function as a manual pump. Both methods use the same level of suction, and so can be considered equivalent in terms of effectiveness and safety.Baird (2001), pp. 4-6. The clinician places a speculum into the vagina and cleanses the cervix then uses a local anesthetic using lidocaine in a paracervical block or intracervical injection into the cervix. The clinician may use instruments called \\"dilators\\" to gently open the cervix, or sometimes medically induce cervical dilation with drugs or osmotic dilators administered before the procedure. Finally, a sterile cannula is inserted into the uterus. The cannula may be attached via tubing to the pump if using an electric vacuum, or attached directly to a syringe if using a manual vacuum aspirator. The pump creates a vacuum which empties uterine contents. After a procedure for abortion or miscarriage treatment, the tissue removed from the uterus is examined for completeness. Expected contents include the embryo or fetus, as well as the decidua, chorionic villi, amniotic fluid, amniotic membrane and other tissue. Post-treatment care includes brief observation in a recovery area and a follow-up appointment approximately two weeks later. These would tend to include tests for infection in case any biological material was not properly removed. Additional medications used in vacuum aspiration include NSAID analgesics that may be started the day before the procedure, as well as misoprostol the day before for cervical ripening.Table 2 in: Procedural sedation and analgesia may also be used for patient discomfort. Advantages over sharp dilation and curettage Sharp dilation and curettage (D&C;), also known as sharp curettage, was once the standard of care in situations requiring uterine evacuation. However, vacuum aspiration has a number of advantages over sharp D&C; and has largely replaced D&C; in many settings.Baird (2001), p. 2. Vacuum aspiration may be used earlier in pregnancy than sharp dilation and curettage (D&C;). Manual vacuum aspiration is the only surgical abortion procedure available earlier than the 6th week of pregnancy. Vacuum aspiration has lower rates of complications when compared to D&C.; Vacuum aspiration, especially manual vacuum aspiration, is significantly cheaper than sharp D&C.; The equipment needed for vacuum aspiration costs less than a curette set. While sharp D&C; is generally provided only by physicians, vacuum aspiration may be performed by advanced practice clinicians such as physician assistants and midwives.Baird (2001), pp. 5,8-13. Manual vacuum aspiration does not require electricity and so can be provided in locations that have unreliable electrical service or none at all. Manual vacuum aspiration also has the advantage of being quiet, without the louder noise of an electric vacuum pump. Complications When used for pregnancy evacuation, vacuum aspiration is 98% effective in removing all uterine contents. Retained products of conception usually require a second aspiration procedure. This is more common when the procedure is performed very early in pregnancy, before 6 weeks gestational age. The rate of infection is 0.5%. Other complications occur at a rate of less than 1 per 100 procedures and include excessive blood loss, creating a hole through the cervix or uterus (perforation) that may cause injury to other internal organs, and uterine adhesions (Asherman's syndrome).

Professional wrestling career =Extreme Championship Wrestling= Early years (1996-1998) Chetti was trained at the Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) \\"House of Hardcore\\" professional wrestling school by Mikey Whipwreck and his cousin, Taz. He made his professional wrestling debut under the ring name GQ Gorgeous as one half of the tag team Erotic Experience with Pat Day at a live event in Middletown, New York on September 21, 1996, where they lost to The Dudleys (Buh Buh Ray and Spike). Erotic Experience made a few appearances at ECW live events for the next few months as enhancement talents against more established wrestlers. Chetti's first win was against fellow House of Hardcore student Roadkill on November 22 and November 23. Chetti changed his ring name to Chris Van de Lay and made his televised debut on the January 30, 1997 episode of Hardcore TV against Mikey Whipwreck in a losing effort. He soon began using his given name Chris Chetti in a match against The Full Blooded Italians member Little Guido at Winter Blowout. Chetti soon established himself as a fan favorite and began feuding with the F.B.I., primarily against Little Guido, whom he defeated for the first time at CyberSlam. At Hostile City Showdown, Chetti teamed with Tracy Smothers to take on F.B.I. members Little Guido and Tommy Rich, during which Smothers turned on Chetti to join Full Blooded Italians. Chetti continued his rivalry with FBI over the next few months. He received several title shots against Shane Douglas for the World Television Championship at Buffalo Invasion and Wrestlepalooza but failed to win the title on both occasions. Chetti formed a tag team with Jerry Lynn as the two defeated FBI in a tag team match at Hostile City Showdown on January 31, 1998. Chetti and Lynn won a rematch against FBI at Living Dangerously, where Chetti made his pay- per-view debut. Chetti feuded with FBI throughout the rest of 1998. At UltraClash, Chetti teamed with J.T. Smith and Tommy Rogers to defeat Little Guido, Tommy Rich and Tracy Smothers in an Italian Vendetta six-man tag team match. Teaming and feuding with Nova (1999-2001) Chetti's first major match in 1999 was a win against Steve Corino at House Party. He soon formed a tag team with Nova. The team of Chetti and Nova had their first feud with Rod Price and Skull Von Krush, whom they defeated at CyberSlam. Chetti and Nova then exchanged wins with Danny Doring and Roadkill at Hostile City Showdown and Heat Wave. At Anarchy Rulz, Nova and Chris Chetti fought Simon Diamond and DeVito to a no contest after interference from ECW wrestlers. At the 2000 Guilty as Charged pay-per-view, Chetti substituted for an injured Jazz as Nova and Kid Kash's tag team partner against the team of Danny Doring, Roadkill and Simon Diamond in a losing effort. Chetti and Nova defeated the team of Jado and Gedo at Living Dangerously. Following the win, they entered the World Tag Team Championship picture as they challenged the tag team champions The Impact Players (Lance Storm and Justin Credible) for the title on the April 24 episode of Hardcore TV in a losing effort. The following week, on Hardcore TV, Chetti defeated Credible in a match, which earned Chetti and Nova, another title shot at Impact Players on the April 14 episode of ECW on TNN, which they lost. Nova and Chetti then continued their success in the tag team division by defeating The New Dangerous Alliance (C.W. Anderson and Bill Wiles) at Wrestlepalooza. At Hardcore Heaven, Chetti and Nova defeated Da Baldies (Angel and Tony DeVito) and the team of Danny Doring and Roadkill in a three-way dance. At Heat Wave, Chetti and Nova defeated Da Baldies in a tag team match. On the August 6 episode of Hardcore TV, Chetti received his first opportunity for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship, challenging Justin Credible for the title in a losing effort. On the September 3 episode of Hardcore TV, Chetti and Nova participated in a tournament for the vacant ECW World Tag Team Championship, where they lost to Team Me (Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger) in the quarter-final. The following week, on Hardcore TV, Chetti and Nova competed against Team Me and Danny Doring and Roadkill in a three-way dance, during which Chetti turned on Nova by hitting him with a chair and causing him to get eliminated, thus turning into a villain for the first time in his ECW career. This disbanded their team and Chetti cut promos in which he berated Nova and held him responsible for Chetti's downfall in ECW and Chetti aligned himself with Lou E. Dangerously. The two former partners began a rivalry against each other, which culminated in a loser leaves town match between the two at November to Remember, which Nova won. This turned out to be Chetti's final ECW match. Chetti returned to ECW at the company's final pay-per-view, Guilty as Charged on January 7, 2001, where he jumped into Nova's match against Chris Hamrick as the special guest referee to favour Hamrick until Spike Dudley made the save for Nova. =Independent circuit and retirement (2001‚Äì2005)= After leaving ECW, Chetti participated in several independent promotions, such as Midwest Championship Wrestling, USA Pro Wrestling and Phoenix Championship Wrestling. During his short stay with the aforementioned promotions, Chetti had rivalries with wrestlers such as Joey Matthews, Nova and Balls Mahoney. Nevertheless, little activity in the promotions and a lack of a final contract carried Chetti to a constant change of home promotions, until October 2002 when he signed a contract with Xtreme Pro Wrestling. On October 5, 2002, Chetti debuted in Xtreme Pro Wrestling at the event Fallout, which was their second show on The East Coast. He defeated Chris Hamrick. During the next months, he failed to win a match, losing to opponents including Shark Boy, Psicosis, and Super Crazy. On November 23, 2002, Chetti proclaimed himself the new ECW FTW Heavyweight Champion, only to lose the title on July 16, 2003 against Danny Doring. Between September 2003 and June 2005, Chetti remained inactive for unknown reasons. In his return match, he was defeated by Devon Storm, but during the month of September 2005, he obtained two victories over Danny Doring. His last public appearance was as a spectator at One Night Stand 2005. After sustaining a back injury, Chetti went into retirement. =Reunion with Nova (2013)= In February 2013 it was announced that Chetti would be coming out of retirement to team with Nova at Pro Wrestling Syndicate's April 5 event against Hurricane Helms and Starman. Chetti and Nova were victorious at PWS Supercard Night 2 in what was billed as their last appearance as a tag team. His family had ringside seats to witness what will likely be his final match.

Social behavior is behavior among two or more organisms within the same species, and encompasses any behavior in which one member affects the other. This is due to an interaction among those members. Social behavior can be seen as similar to an exchange of goods, with the expectation that when you give, you will receive the same. This behavior can be effected by both the qualities of the individual and the environmental (situational) factors. Therefore, social behavior arises as a result of an interaction between the two‚Äîthe organism and its environment. This means that, in regards to humans, social behavior can be determined by both the individual characteristics of the person, and the situation they are in. A major aspect of social behavior is communication, which is the basis for survival and reproduction. Social behavior is said to be determined by two different processes, that can either work together or oppose one another. The dual-systems model of reflective and impulsive determinants of social behavior came out of the realization that behavior cannot just be determined by one single factor. Instead, behavior can arise by those consciously behaving (where there is an awareness and intent), or by pure impulse. These factors that determine behavior can work in different situations and moments, and can even oppose one another. While at times one can behave with a specific goal in mind, other times they can behave without rational control, and driven by impulse instead. There are also distinctions between different types of social behavior, such as mundane versus defensive social behavior. Mundane social behavior is a result of interactions in day-to-day life, and are behaviors learned as one is exposed to those different situations. On the other hand, defensive behavior arises out of impulse, when one is faced with conflicting desires.  The development of social behavior  Social behavior constantly changes as one continues to grow and develop, reaching different stages of life. The development of behavior is deeply tied with the biological and cognitive changes one is experiencing at any given time. This creates general patterns of social behavior development in humans. Just as social behavior is influenced by both the situation and an individual's characteristics, the development of behavior is due to the combination of the two as well‚Äîthe temperament of the child along with the settings they are exposed to. Culture (parents and individuals that influence socialization in children) play a large role in the development of a child's social behavior, as the parents or caregivers are typically those who decide the settings and situations that the child is exposed to. These various settings the child is placed in (for example, the playground and classroom) form habits of interaction and behavior insomuch as the child being exposed to certain settings more frequently than others. What takes particular precedence in the influence of the setting are the people that the child must interact with‚Äîtheir age, sex, and at times culture. Emotions also play a large role in the development of social behavior, as they are intertwined with the way an individual behaves. Through social interactions, emotion is understood through various verbal and nonverbal displays, and thus plays a large role in communication. Many of the processes that occur in the brain and underlay emotion often greatly correlate with the processes that are needed for social behavior as well. A major aspect of interaction is understanding how the other person thinks and feels, and being able to detect emotional states becomes necessary for individuals to effectively interact with one another and behave socially. As the child continues to gain social information, their behavior develops accordingly. One must learn how to behave according to the interactions and people relevant to a certain setting, and therefore begin to intuitively know the appropriate form of social interaction depending on the situation. Therefore, behavior is constantly changing as required, and maturity brings this on. A child must learn to balance their own desires with those of the people they interact with, and this ability to correctly respond to contextual cues and understand the intentions and desires of another person improves with age. That being said, the individual characteristics of the child (their temperament) is important to understanding how the individual learns social behaviors and cues given to them, and this learnability is not consistent across all children. = Patterns of development across the lifespan = When studying patterns of biological development across the human lifespan, there are certain patterns that are well-maintained across humans. These patterns can often correspond with social development, and biological changes lead to respective changes in interactions. In pre and post-natal infancy, the behavior of the infant is correlated with that of the caregiver. In infancy, there is already a development of the awareness of a stranger, in which case the individual is able to identify and distinguish between people. Come childhood, the individual begins to attend more to their peers, and communication begins to take a verbal form. One also begins to classify themselves on the basis of their gender and other qualities salient about themselves, like race and age. When the child reaches school age, one typically becomes more aware of the structure of society in regards to gender, and how their own gender plays a role in this. They become more and more reliant on verbal forms of communication, and more likely to form groups and become aware of their own role within the group. An adult and infant By puberty, general relations among same and opposite sex individuals are much more salient, and individuals begin to behave according to the norms of these situations. With increasing awareness of their sex and stereotypes that go along with it, the individual begins to choose how much they align with these stereotypes, and behaves either according to those stereotypes or not. This is also the time that individuals more often form sexual pairs. Once the individual reaches childrearing age, one must begin to undergo changes within the own behavior in accordance to major life-changes of a developing family. The potential new child requires the parent to modify their behavior to accommodate a new member of the family. Come senescence and retirement, behavior is more stable as the individual has often established their social circle (whatever it may be) and is more committed to their social structure.  Neural and biological correlates of social behavior  = Neural correlates = Rhesus monkey Anatomical location of the amygdala With the advent of the field social cognitive neuroscience came interest in studying social behavior's correlates within the brain, to see what is happening beneath the surface as organisms act in a social manner. Although there is debate on which particular regions of the brain are responsible for social behavior, some have claimed that the paracingulate cortex is activated when one person is thinking about the motives or aims of another, a means of understanding the social world and behaving accordingly. The medial prefrontal lobe has also been seen to have activation during social cognition Research has discovered through studies on rhesus monkeys that the amygdala, a region known for expressing fear, was activated specifically when the monkeys were faced with a social situation they had never been in before. This region of the brain was shown to be sensitive to the fear that comes with a novel social situation, inhibiting social interaction. Another form of studying the brain regions that may be responsible for social behavior has been through looking at patients with brain injuries who have an impairment in social behavior. Lesions in the prefrontal cortex that occurred in adulthood can effect the functioning of social behavior. When these lesions or a dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex occur in infancy/early on in life, the development of proper moral and social behavior is effected and thus atypical. = Biological correlates = A prairie vole Along with neural correlates, research has investigated what happens within the body (and potentially modulates) social behavior. Vasopressin is a posterior pituitary hormone that is seen to potentially play a role in affiliation for young rats. Along with young rats, vasopressin has also been associated with paternal behavior in prairie voles. Efforts have been made to connect animal research to humans, and found that vasopressin may play a role in the social responses of males in human research. Oxytocin has also been seen to be correlated with positive social behavior, and elevated levels have been shown to potentially help improve social behavior that may have been suppressed due to stress. Thus, targeting levels of oxytocin may play a role in interventions of disorders that deal with atypical social behavior. Along with vasopressin, serotonin has also been inspected in relation to social behavior in humans. It was found to be associated with human feelings of social connection, and we see a drop in serotonin when one is socially isolated or has feelings of social isolation. Serotonin has also been associated with social confidence.  Affect and social behavior  Positive affect (emotion) has been seen to have a large impact on social behavior, particularly by inducing more helping behavior, cooperation, and sociability. Studies have shown that even subtly inducing positive affect within individuals caused greater social behavior and helping. This phenomenon, however, is not one-directional. Just as positive affect can influence social behavior, social behavior can have an influence on positive affect.  Electronic media and social behavior  Social behavior has typically been seen as a changing of behaviors relevant to the situation at hand, acting appropriately with the setting one is in. However, with the advent of electronic media, people began to find themselves in situations they may have not been exposed to in everyday life. Novel situations and information presented through electronic media has formed interactions that are completely new to people. While people typically behaved in line with their setting in face-to-face interaction, the lines have become blurred when it comes to electronic media. This has led to a cascade of results, as gender norms started to merge, and people were coming in contact with information they had never been exposed to through face-to-face interaction. A political leader could no longer tailor a speech to just one audience, for their speech would be translated and heard by anyone through the media. People can no longer play drastically different roles when put in different situations, because the situations overlap more as information is more readily available. Communication flows more quickly and fluidly through media, causing behavior to merge accordingly. An example of helping behavior Media has also been shown to have an impact on promoting different types of social behavior, such as prosocial and aggressive behavior. For example, violence shown through the media has been seen to lead to more aggressive behavior in its viewers. Research has also been done investigating how media portraying positive social acts, prosocial behavior, could lead to more helping behavior in its viewers. The general learning model was established to study how this process of translating media into behavior works, and why. This model suggests a link between positive media with prosocial behavior and violent media with aggressive behavior, and posits that this is mediated by the characteristics of the individual watching along with the situation they are in. This model also presents the notion that when one is exposed to the same type of media for long periods of time, this could even lead to changes within their personality traits, as they are forming different sets of knowledge and may be behaving accordingly. In various studies looking specifically at how video games with prosocial content effect behavior, it was shown that exposure influenced subsequent helping behavior in the video-game player. The processes that underlay this effect point to prosocial thoughts being more readily available after playing a video game related to this, and thus the person playing the game is more likely to behave accordingly. These effects were not only found with video games, but also with music, as people listening to songs involving aggression and violence in the lyrics were more likely to act in an aggressive manner. Likewise, people listening to songs related to prosocial acts (relative to a song with neutral lyrics) were shown to express greater helping behaviors and more empathy afterwards. When these songs were played at restaurants, it even led to an increase in tips given (relative to those who heard neutral lyrics).  Aggressive and violent behavior  See article: Aggression Aggression is an important social behavior that can have both negative consequences (in a social interaction) and adaptive consequences (adaptive in humans and other primates for survival). There are many differences in aggressive behavior, and a lot of these differences are sex- difference based.  Verbal, coverbal, and nonverbal social behavior  = Verbal and coverbal behaviors = See articles: Conversation and Language An example of hand gestures and facial expression accompanying speech. Although most animals can communicate nonverbally, humans have the ability to communicate with both verbal and nonverbal behavior. Verbal behavior is the content one's spoken word. Verbal and nonverbal behavior intersect in what is known as coverbal behavior, which is nonverbal behavior that contribute to the meaning of verbal speech (i.e. hand gestures used to emphasize the importance of what someone is saying). Although the spoken words convey meaning in and of themselves, one cannot dismiss the coverbal behaviors that accompany the words, as they place great emphasis on the thought and importance contributing to the verbal speech. Therefore, the verbal behaviors and gestures that accompany it work together to make up a conversation. Although many have posited this idea that nonverbal behavior accompanying speech serves an important role in communication, it is important to note that not all researchers agree. However, in most literature on gestures, we see that unlike body language, gestures can accompany speech in ways that bring inner thoughts to life (often thoughts unable to be expressed verbally). Gestures (coverbal behaviors) and speech occur simultaneously, and develop along the same trajectory within children as well. = Nonverbal behaviors = See main article: Nonverbal communication An example of a nonverbal behavior (facial expression, smile) Behaviors that include any change in facial expression or body movement constitute the meaning of nonverbal behavior. Communicative nonverbal behavior include facial and body expressions that are intentionally meant to convey a message to those who are meant to receive it. Nonverbal behavior can serve a specific purpose (i.e. to convey a message), or can be more of an impulse/reflex. Paul Ekman, an influential psychologist, investigated both verbal and nonverbal behavior (and their role in communication) a great deal, emphasizing how difficult it is to empirically test such behaviors. Nonverbal cues can serve the function of conveying a message, thought, or emotion both to the person viewing the behavior and the person sending these cues.  Disorders involving impairments in social behavior  A number of forms of mental disorder affect social behavior. Social anxiety disorder is a phobic disorder characterized by a fear of being judged by others, which manifests itself as a fear of people in general. Due to this pervasive fear of embarrassing oneself in front of others, it causes those affected to avoid interactions with other people. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder mainly identified by its symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Hyperactivity- Impulsivity may lead to hampered social interactions, as one who displays these symptoms may be socially intrusive, unable to maintain personal space, and talk over others. The majority of children that display symptoms of ADHD also have problems with their social behavior. Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects the functioning of social interaction and communication. People who fall on the autism spectrum scale may have difficulties in understanding social cues and the emotional states of others. Learning disabilities are often defined as a specific deficit in academic achievement; however, research has shown that with a learning disability can come social skill deficits as well.

Other two outstanding monuments are the shrine of Our Lady of the Assumption (1234) and the parish church dedicated to Saint Roch (1575). Suardi Castle The date of the castle construction remains unknown, although an inscription on the right side of the portal which leads to the inner courtyard bears the date 1233. Surrounded by a double walls with the remains of the rampart, the castle has a perfectly square shape and is dominated by its tower, centered on the front side of the building. The castle was never used as a noble residence but served as a safe place to keep agricultural produce and shelter wayfarers. Thanks to its position, it was also used to control the road linking up Cavallina and Seriana valleys. Valuable frescoes are still preserved in the castle main entrance: playful Cupids with garlands and flowers on the barrel vault; the cardinal Virtues on the niches by the sides of the Gothic portal. The Shrine of Our Lady of the Assumption Built in 1234, it served as parish church until 1614, when a new, greater church was built in the center of the village.

It is a method of abortion as well as a common procedure used after miscarriage to remove all pregnancy tissue. In various health care centers it may be called by different names: * D&E; (Dilation and evacuation) * ERPOC (Evacuation of Retained Products of Conception) * TOP or STOP ((Surgical) Termination Of Pregnancy) D&E; normally refers to a specific second trimester procedure. However, some sources use the term D&E; to refer more generally to any procedure that involves the processes of dilation and evacuation, which includes the first trimester procedures of manual and electric vacuum aspiration. Intact Dilation and Extraction (D&X;) is a different procedural variation on D&E.; Indications for D&E; Dilation and evacuation (D&E;) is one of the methods available to completely remove the fetus and all of the placental tissue in the uterus after the first trimester of pregnancy. A D&E; may be performed for a surgical abortion, or for surgical management of a miscarriage. = Abortion = Induced abortion after the first trimester of pregnancy is rare. Approximately 630,000 abortions were performed in the US in 2015, the most recent year for which data are available. Fewer than 10% of all abortions in the United States are performed after 13 weeks of gestation, and just over 1% are performed after 21 weeks gestation. In the United States, 95-99% of abortions after the first trimester of pregnancy are performed by surgical abortion via dilation and evacuation. People who do not have access to affordable abortion care in their area or who face legal restrictions to obtaining a wanted abortion may wait longer to get an abortion after they make the decision to terminate their pregnancy. When an abortion is delayed, a D&E; may be necessary. = Miscarriage = Dilation and evacuation can be offered for management of second trimester miscarriage if skilled providers are available. Some women choose D&E; over labor induction for a second trimester loss because it can be a scheduled surgical procedure, offering predictability over labor induction, or because they find it emotionally easier than undergoing labor and delivery. Both methods offer the option of fetal and placental testing. Although pregnancy loss is emotionally distressing, there are rarely medical complications associated with a short (< 1 week) delay to management. Description of procedure = Cervical preparation = Prior to the procedure, cervical preparation with osmotic dilators or medications is recommended in order to reduce risk of complications such as cervical laceration and to facilitate cervical dilation during the procedure. Although there is no consensus as to which method of cervical preparation is superior in terms of safety and technical ease of the procedure, one particular concern is reducing the risk of preterm birth. Concerns within the medical community have advised against or at least asked for further research concerning the safety of performing the dilation of the cervix on the same day as the surgery for some or all second trimester pregnancies. The concern is that performing the dilation too soon before the surgery could increase the risk of preterm birth should the woman ever carry a subsequent pregnancy to term. = Anesthesia options = Most patients will be provided NSAIDs for pain management. Local anesthetics, such as lidocaine, are frequently injected by the cervix to reduce pain during the procedure. IV sedation may also be used. General anesthesia may be used depending on individual circumstances, however it is not preferred as it adds significant anesthesia risks to the procedure. = Infection prophylaxis = Immediately prior to the procedure, antibiotics are usually administered to prevent infection. = Surgical procedure = A speculum is placed in the vagina to allow visualization of the cervix. If osmotic dilators were placed prior to the procedure, these are removed. The cervix may be further dilated with rigid dilator instruments (as opposed to osmotic dilators). Sufficient cervical dilation decreases the risk of morbidity, including cervical injury and uterine perforation. Uterine contents are removed using a cannula to apply aspiration, followed by forceps. Tissue inspection ensures removal of the fetus in its entirety. The procedure may be performed under ultrasound guidance to aid in visualizing uterine anatomy and to assess if all tissue has been removed at the completion of the procedure. The procedure usually takes less than half an hour. = Recovery = Most D&E;'s are performed in the outpatient setting, and can be safely sent home same day after a period of observed recovery, ranging from 45 minutes to several hours. Generally, the woman may return to work the following day. The type of anesthesia given also influences the appropriate amount of recovery time before discharge. There is rarely a need for narcotic pain medications afterwards, and NSAIDs are recommended for home pain management. Recovery from the procedure is typically fast and uncomplicated. Some women may experience lactation after a second- trimester loss or termination of pregnancy. At this time, medications to suppress lactation are not proven to be effective. =Variations= If the fetus is removed intact, the procedure is referred to as intact dilation and extraction by the American Medical Association,Health and Ethics Policies of the AMA American Medical Association.

Retrieved 2007-04-22.  Risks  D&E; is a safe procedure when performed by experienced practitioners. The rate of mortality following legal procedures in the US is 0.62 legal induced abortion-related deaths per 100,000 reported legal abortions. The strongest risk factor for mortality following abortion is increasing gestational age. Risks of D&E; include bleeding, infection, uterine perforation, and damage to surrounding organs or tissues . Hemorrhage occurs following less than 1% of all surgical abortions. Infection rates following second trimester abortion have been reported to be 0.1-4%. The risk of infection is decreased by the use of antibiotics. Rare risks of D&E; include uterine perforation, retained products of conception, and rare risk of hysterectomy. There is no evidence that surgical abortion causes in increase in infertility or adverse outcomes in subsequent pregnancies.  Alternatives *Labor induction abortion Medical abortion Complication rates after D&E; are similar to or lower than those of labor induction (medical abortion) after 13 weeks, though few studies exist comparing the two approaches. . . In certain clinical scenariossevere anemia, for example D&E; may be preferred over labor induction.

These would eventually lead to the formation of the UK Special Boat Service. Courtney was a bank clerk in Leeds, England, before he became a professional white hunter and gold prospector in East Africa. Upon his return to England he wrote an account of his experiences, a book entitled Claws of Africa, Experiences of a Professional Big-game Hunter (published in 1934 by George G. Harrap & Co.) He was also a sergeant in the Palestinian Police Force. When World War II began, he travelled from Africa (where he was big-game hunting) to England to join the Army as a \\"commando folding kayaker\\". When his ideas were rebuffed, he joined the King's Royal Rifle Corps as a Rifleman. Soon promoted to Corporal, he was commissioned in November 1939. Courtney became an Army Commando recruit in mid-1940, and was sent to the Combined Training Centre in Scotland. He was unsuccessful in his initial attempts to convince Admiral of the Fleet Roger Keyes and later Admiral Theodore Hallett, commander of the Combined Training Centre, that his idea of a folding kayak brigade would be effective. He decided to infiltrate , a Landing Ship, Infantry anchored in the River Clyde. Courtney paddled to the ship, climbed aboard undetected, wrote his initials on the door to the captain's cabin, and stole a deck gun cover. He presented the soaking cover to a group of high-ranking Royal Navy officers meeting at a nearby Inveraray hotel. He was promoted to Captain, and given command of twelve men, the first Special Boat Section. Courtney's brother Gruff (G.B. Courtney) later commanded a second section of the SBS. The units carried out several raids during the early years of the war, especially in the Mediterranean, which validated Courtney's idea of mounting small-scale attacks from the sea. Gruff himself took part in Operation Flagpole (World War II). However, heavy losses led to its personnel being amalgamated in 1943 into the new Special Boat Squadron, led by George Jellicoe.

She is also known for her appearances in The Sopranos as a \\"Bada Bing Girl\\". Early life Adamo grew up in New York City, where she worked as a child and adult model for Ford Models. Before deciding to become a professional wrestler, Adamo held a series of other jobs, including tending bar, working as a donut stuffer for Country Donuts, working as a booker for a modeling agency, working as a fitting model, performing as an oil wrestler at the strip clubs Billy Dean's and Goldfingers, and working as a booker for go go bars. Professional wrestling career In the late 1990s, Adamo decided to become a professional wrestler. She was trained as a professional wrestler by The Fabulous Moolah in South Carolina and by Johnny Rodz in New York City. She debuted in 1999 under the ring name \\"Elektra\\". Elektra appeared on the April 5, 1999 edition of WWF Raw is War, playing one of the Godfather's \\"hos\\" during his match with WWF Intercontinental Champion Goldust. =Extreme Championship Wrestling (1999-2001)= Elektra debuted in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in October 1999, with Cyrus the Virus presenting her to Danny Doring as a replacement for Miss Congeniality. She went on to act as a valet for Doring and his tag team partner, Roadkill, interfering in their matches and fighting with opposing valets such as Francine. Elektra became known for her ability to flex her pectoralis major muscles, which she would often do while delivering promos. At Living Dangerously 2000 on March 12, 2000, Elektra turned on Doring and Roadkill, costing them a match against Lou E. Dangerously's New Dangerous Alliance (C.W. Anderson and Bill Wiles) by unbalancing Roadkill while he stood on the top rope. Later that night, Elektra delivered a promo in which she revealed that she had joined the New Dangerous Alliance. Elektra was subsequently nicknamed the \\"Director of Covert Operations\\" of the New Dangerous Alliance. At Hardcore Heaven 2000 on May 14, the New Dangerous Alliance came to the ring with Elektra wearing a Mike Awesome T-shirt (Awesome had abruptly left ECW for World Championship Wrestling the prior month and was an unpopular figure with ECW fans as a result). After Lou E. Dangerously described Elektra as \\"the toughest woman in wrestling today\\", Jazz attacked the New Dangerous Alliance and tore off Elektra's T-shirt, leaving her in a swimsuit. After the New Dangerous Alliance disbanded, Elektra aligned herself with EZ Money, Julio Dinero and Chris Hamrick (collectively known as Hot Commodity). At Anarchy Rulz 2000 on October 1, Elektra accompanied EZ Money to the ring for his match with Kid Kash. Following the match, The Sandman caned the members of Hot Commodity before spitting beer over Elektra.

His father died when he was 12 and his mother two years later. At the age of 15, he became an apprentice carriage-maker and worked at it industriously for four years while attending night school, when he moved to Griffin, Georgia. He married Emily Alexander and raised a family. He enlisted in the Confederate States Army on April 20, 1861, and served in Virginia, rising to the rank of captain. On the night of April 7, 1865, in the company of Colonel Heman H. Perry, assistant adjutant general of Moxley Sorrel's brigade, English received the first written communication from Grant to Lee about a surrender, which happened soon after at Appomattox Court House. Following his parole, English arrived in Atlanta on May 14, 1865, where he later became a banker. On December 1, 1880, he defeated developer H. I. Kimball to become mayor, taking office in January.Lankevich, Atlanta: A Chronological & Documentary History, p.27 He served as president of the American Trust and Banking Company (later rechartered as the Fourth National Bank) for thirty years.History of Wachovia Bank He also served twenty-four years on the board of directors of the Central of Georgia Railway Company.Annual Report of the Central of Georgia Railway Company. He was one of the incorporators of the 1883 Fulton County Street Railroad, which would later become famous for its Nine-Mile Circle route to what is now Virginia-Highland. From 1871 until his death, he resided on Cone Street between Walton and Poplar in the Fairlie-Poplar district. The home was torn down soon after he died; it was one of the last single-family homes in downtown Atlanta. Atlanta's English Avenue was named for J.W. English, Junior. James W. English, Sr., was one of the directors of the 1887 Piedmont Exposition. English was one of Atlanta's most prominent citizens in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and was an ardent promoter of a New South, based on industry rather than on cotton. He quickly achieved success in business and politics. He served as a city council member, school board member, the police commissioner, the mayor of Atlanta, a bank president, and owner of several industrial enterprises. James English & convict leasing While he was not descended from the antebellum era aristocracy and had never owned a slave before emancipation, by 1897 \\"his enterprises controlled 1,206 of Georgia's 2,881 convict laborers, engaged in brick making, cutting cross ties, lumbering, railroad construction, and turpentining.\\" His \\"great personal wealth was inextricably linked to the enslavement of thousands of men.\\" English was most closely identified with the Chattahoochee Brick Company, which manufactured many of the bricks used to construct Atlanta's streets and some of its oldest neighborhoods. Although its methods were nearly identical to those used centuries before, it achieved high levels of productivity and vast profits by subjecting the convict laborers it leased from the city to brutal discipline and cruel deprivation. The Chattahoochee Brick Company was \\"the biggest and arguably most abusive buyer of forced laborers in Georgia.\\" Before a legislative commission in 1908, former guards as well as workers reported that at the brickyard prisoners \\"were forced to work under unbearable circumstances, fed rotting and rancid food, housed in barracks rife with insects, driven with whips into the hottest and most intolerable areas of the plant, and continually required to work at a constant run in the heat of the ovens.\\" English countered with a denial that he or any member of his family had ever directed \\"any act of cruelty\\" against any convict. In fact, he claimed, he had ordered his manager of operations to ensure that \\"workers were well fed, well shod, well clothed, and well cared for‚Ä¶.\\" Although one former guard estimated that 200 to 300 laborers were flogged each month, English angrily protested, \\"If a warden in charge of those convicts ever committed an act of cruelty to them‚Ä¶and it had come to my knowledge, I would have had him indicted and prosecuted.\\" Another witness testified that if English had come within a quarter mile of the plant, he would have heard the screams of men being beaten. English conceded that the work at the brickyard was so brutal that \\"not a class of [free] white labor in Georgia‚Ä¶ could stand it a week.\\" English insisted he only used convict labor to do \\"work that a white man cannot and will not perform.\\" He also employed convicts at a large sawmill, the Iron Belt Railroad and Mining Company, and the Durham Coal and Coke Company, which in 1908 owned leases on 430 convicts. Its operations included some particularly dangerous mine shafts, sections of which were filled waist- high with water. Workers were not provided with adequate timbers for bracing and cave-ins were frequent. Even when materials were provided, they often neglected to use them since they feared, if they took time to protect themselves, they would not complete their daily task and consequently be whipped by bosses who would sometimes embed their lashes with sand to increase the severity of the punishment. English routinely violated the law by buying and selling the leases on convict laborers and thereby transferring them as if they were slaves. For example, in 1883 he purchased half of John T. Milner's Coalburg mine company and, \\"in an overtly illegal aspect of the transaction, a lot of one hundred black convicts.\\" A witness before the legislative commission reported, \\"On Sunday afternoons, white men frequently met in the yard of the English brick factory to swap or buy black men, little changed from the slave markets of a half century earlier.\\" References External links * James Warren English Find A Grave memorial. * Ambrotype of Captain James W.

At that time it was the seat of a castellan, and a market center, located near the Vistula crossing. In 1205, the Battle of Zawichost was fought nearby, in which Roman the Great of Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia was defeated by Lesser Poland‚Äôs army of Leszek I the White, and Mazovian army of Konrad I of Masovia. It is not known when Zawichost was granted town rights, most probably it happened before 1255. In 1257, prince Boles≈Çaw V the Chaste gave the town together with 25 nearby villages to the Order of Poor Ladies. In the 14th century, Zawichost became a royal town and the seat of a starosta. King Kazimierz Wielki built a castle here, which guarded the Vistula crossing. Like other towns in Leser Poland, Zawichost prospered in the 15th and 16th centuries. At that time, it was located along a merchant route from Krak√≥w to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and profited from taxes on goods transported on the Vistula. In 1564 the town had a number of artisans, a town hall and 126 houses. Good times ended during the Deluge. Zawichost was ransacked and destroyed first by the Swedes (1655), and then by the Transilvanians of George II R√°k√≥czi. The invaders burned the castle, which remained in ruins until 1813, when during a flood its walls collapsed into the Vistula. In 1666 Zawichost experienced a great fire and then a plague, in which most residents died. After all these misfortunes, the town never recovered. Furthermore, after the Partitions of Poland Zawichost was located near Russian - Austrian border, which hampered its development. At the beginning of the 18th century, the town of Starost√≥w (later known as Prosper√≥w) was established near Zawichost. Most of its inhabitants were Jewish, and in 1820, Prosper√≥w merged with Zawichost. Since then the division between the Polish town, and the Jewish town was established. In 1827, Zawichost had 281 houses (most of them wooden) and 2,320 inhabitants. In 1888 it lost its town rights and was reduced to the status of a village, to regain town privileges in 1926. During World War II, German occupiers opened a ghetto in Zawichost, with 5,000 Jews. Most of them were murdered in October 1942 at Be≈Ç≈ºec death camp. In 1944, fierce fighting between the Wehrmacht and the Red Army took place in Zawichost, in which most of the town was destroyed.

He was also an officer in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. Biography =Early years and education= Hillyer was born in Athens, Georgia, one of eight children of Judge Junius Hillyer, a United States Congressman and solicitor of the U.S. Treasury, and Jane Selina Watkins. He graduated from Mercer University in July 1854, \\"securing honors in all branches of study\\". He then studied law under the supervision of his father, Judge Hillyer, in Monroe, Georgia and in 1855 was admitted to the state bar. For the first two years of his legal career he practiced with his father, then set up a partnership with the Hon. Hope Hull until the start of the Civil War. =Georgia House of Representatives= At the age of 21, Hillyer ran for a seat in the state legislature, and was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1856. He was sworn in the following January and served one two-year term. Hillyer then served as Clerk of the Georgia House of Representatives from 1859-1860. In 1860 he was selected as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois, where he supported the nomination of Howell Cobb for President. =Military service= With the outbreak of the Civil War, Hillyer raised a Walton County company known as the \\"Hillyer Rifles\\" in the late spring of 1861. The men were mustered into the Confederate Army on June 13, with Hillyer elected as the captain of what became Company C of the 9th Georgia Volunteer Infantry. He and the regiment were sent by train to Virginia and assigned to the newly created brigade of George \\"Tige\\" Anderson in the newly organized Army of Northern Virginia. Hillyer saw extensive fighting at Fredericksburg (briefly commanding the regiment) and Gettysburg, where he fought at the famed \\"Wheatfield\\" on July 2, 1863. The 9th Georgia lost half of its 340 men in the fight, and Hillyer's company suffered considerable losses. With all the senior officers wounded or killed, Hillyer assumed command of the regiment for the rest of the Gettysburg Campaign, and wrote the official report of the 9th Georgia's service in the battle. Union General Joseph Hooker remarked that Confederate Captain Hillyer was \\"a most able, efficient & gallant officer\\". Hillyer resigned his captain's commission in November 1863 to become an auditor for the Western & Atlantic Railroad at the request of Governor Joseph E. Brown, who preferred a military man for the role as the railroad was the main supply route for General Joseph E. Johnston's Confederate army. Early in 1864, Hillyer organized the State Road Battalion (consisting mainly of railroad men) and he was placed in command of the defenses of the railroad with the rank of major. Seeing action against cavalry raiders during the Atlanta Campaign, Hillyer performed well, but the railroad eventually fell to the Union Army. He and his remaining men surrendered to Federal officers on May 10, 1865. =Legal career and political office= After the war, Hillyer set a law practice in Atlanta with his brother, Henry. The two worked together for a number of years before George eventually joined the law firm of Hillyer, Alexander & Lambdin. In June 1867, at the age of 32, Hillyer married Ellen Emily Cooley, and together they undertook to raise a family, eventually having 8 children (three of whom died in infancy). Starting in 1870, he served four years as a Democrat in the Georgia Senate, representing the 35th District, which included Fulton, Clayton, and Cobb counties. He served as the Georgia delegate to the United States Centennial Commission that planned and organized the country's Centennial celebrations and the International Exhibition of 1876. He was appointed to the Fulton County Superior Court by Governor Alfred H. Colquitt, serving from 1877-1883. =The city of Atlanta= In 1885 Hillyer served one term as mayor of Atlanta, during which time he became an expert on municipal water services, publishing several related articles and serving on the Atlanta Water Commission for many years. Hillyer played an active role in the establishment of the Atlanta University System to provide higher education to the freed slaves. He was on the board of trustees for Spelman Baptist Seminary, as well as Vice-Chairman for the Georgia Railroad Commission. =Death and legacy= He died at the age of 92 and was buried in Atlanta's Oakland Cemetery.

In 1806, as part of his wholescale re-ordering of the map of Europe, Emperor Napol√©on I of the French upgraded the independent German duchy of Bavaria to full kingdom status. The former Duke of Bavaria, now King of Bavaria, Maximilian I, commemorated the fact by commissioning a set of crown jewels for use by Bavarian monarchs. However, there was no coronation ceremony, and the king never wore the crown in public. Rather, it was placed on a cushion when displayed on occasions such as the king's ascension or his funeral. Included in the regalia were: * The Crown of Bavaria - the King's crown, which was set with rubies, diamonds, emeralds, sapphires and pearls; * the Crown of the Queens of Bavaria, which was made for the then queen, Karoline of Baden, and which contains huge pearls and large diamonds; * The 96 centimetre long State Sword; * The Royal Orb - made of gold; * The 89 centimetre long Royal Sceptre set with brilliants, emeralds and sapphires and the top is surmounted by a small round crown. The Palatinate Pearl is also kept with the crown jewels, however it is not officially part of the collection. As a result of the First World War, the German monarchies were abolished in 1918 and since then, Bavaria has not had a monarch.

The procedure is generally used after the failure of another method, or when such a procedure would be medically inadvisable, such as in the case of placenta accreta.Roche, Natalie E. (June 16, 2006). Surgical Management of Abortion. Retrieved July 1, 2007. In 2016, this method made up less than 0.01% of all abortions in the United States, with the CDC reporting only 51 having occurred due to the invasive and complex nature of the procedure, and the availability of much simpler and safer methods.  Indications  As with other abortion procedures, the purpose of a Hysterotomy abortion is to end a pregnancy by removing the fetus and placenta. This method is the most dangerous of any abortion procedure, and has the highest complication rate.  Procedure  Hysterotomy is major abdominal surgery, and is generally only performed in hospitals and other advanced practice settings. The procedure is nearly identical to a cesarean section, with two main exceptions, those being the administration of a Feticidal injection of digoxin or potassium chloride before the procedure to insure fetal demise, guaranteeing compliance with various laws on the subject, and preventing an unintended live birth; and the size of the incision, which is generally smaller than that of a cesarean section, as the fetus is generally not full term. Friday, October 2, 2020  History  Scholarly sources place the use of this method since at least 1913. Health officials in the United States warned practitioners against performing hysterotomy abortion in an outpatient setting after it led to the deaths of two women in New York during 1971. The rate of mortality of abortion by hysterotomy and hysterectomy reported in the United States between 1972 and 1981 was 60 per 100,000, or 0.06%.

The term \\"satin glass\\" is frequently used to refer to a collectible type of pressed glass. Satin glass can be used for decorative items. However, satin glass is also used to provide privacy where the full transparency of glass is undesirable. The satin finish is produced by treating the glass with hydrofluoric acid or hydrofluoric acid fumes. Satin glass was first made as decorative pressed glass in England and the United States during the 1880s. Many companies have produced this type of satin glass. It is similar to milk glass in that it is opaque, and has decorative surface patterns molded into it, however, satin glass has a satin, rather than glossy surface. Satin glass is typically tinted with a pastel color, blue is the most common. It was produced by the Fenton Art Glass Company between 1972 and 1984 in large quantities. Satin glass, like milk glass and carnival glass, is considered a collectible. Due to recent high production volume, prices commanded by satin glass are relatively low. However, certain large pieces produced in low volume can command high prices, especially if in perfect condition. Burnishing a piece of satin glass will polish the satin finish away, leaving a glossy spot and greatly reducing the value as a collectable. Even friction from repeated ordinary handling, such as dusting with a cloth, will eventually add glossy spots to the finish, so the most desirable pieces become more rare even without breakage and chipping.

As such he was one of the longest serving bishops of the Church of England. Crew was the son of John Crew, 1st Baron Crew and a grandson of Thomas Crewe, Speaker of the House of Commons. He was educated at Lincoln College, Oxford; ordained deacon and priest on the same day in Lent 1665; and appointed Rector of the college in 1668. He became dean and precentor of Chichester on 29 April 1669, Clerk of the Closet to Charles II shortly afterwards (holding that post until the Glorious Revolution in December 1688). He was elected Bishop of Oxford in April 1671 and Bishop of Durham on 18 August 1674. He owed his rapid promotions to the Duke of York (later James VII & II), whose favour he had gained by secretly encouraging the duke's interest in the Roman Catholic Church. Crew baptised the Duke's daughter Princess Catherine in 1675 and was made a Privy Counsellor on 26 April 1676 He was present at the crucial Privy Council meeting in October 1678 where Titus Oates first revealed his great fabrication, the Popish Plot. After the accession of James II, Crew was also appointed Dean of the Chapel Royal on 28 December 1685,Bucholz, R.O. Office-Holders in Modern Britain: Volume 11 (revised): Court Officers, 1660-1837 Accessed 8 September 2014 staying in post until 1688. He was part of the ecclesiastical commission of 1686, which suspended Henry Compton, Bishop of London (for refusing to suspend John Sharp, then rector of St Giles's-in-the-Fields, whose anti-papal writings had rendered him obnoxious to the king) and Crew shared the administration of the see of London with Thomas Sprat, Bishop of Rochester. On the decline of King James's power, Crew dissociated himself from the court, and made a bid for the favour of William III's new government by voting for the motion that James had abdicated. He was excepted from the general pardon of 1690, but afterwards was allowed to retain his see. His tenure as Bishop of Durham saw the first two new parishes to be erected in England since the Reformation. These were at Stockton-on-Tees in 1712 and Sunderland. The Church of the Holy Trinity in Sunderland, now redundant, was the base for responsible local government in the growing port town for the first time since the Borough of Sunderland, created by the Bishops of Durham, was crushed by Oliver Cromwell in the English Civil War. From 1681 to 1688 Crew lived at 43 King Street, Covent Garden. He died in 1721. Crew had married twice: firstly to Penelope Frowde on 21 December 1691; then, after Penelope's death in 1699, secondly to Dorothy Forster on 23 July 1700. Dorothy died in 1715. In 1697, Crew had succeeded his brother Thomas as the 3rd Baron Crew, but had no children and thus the barony became extinct upon his death. Legacy He left large estates to be devoted to charitable ends, and his benefaction to Lincoln College and to Oxford University is commemorated in the annual Creweian Oration.Oxford Glossary . University of Oxford, UK. His memory is also perpetuated in The Lord Crewe Arms Hotel at Blanchland, whose community Crew rebuilt. Crew bought the village in 1708 and on his death in 1721 it passed to his trust, which remains the landlord.Blanchland History Accessed 15 July 2014 .

Or My Mom Will Shoot is a 1992 American buddy cop black comedy film directed by Roger Spottiswoode and starring Sylvester Stallone and Estelle Getty. The film was released in the United States on February 21, 1992. The film received highly negative reviews, and was a box office bomb. It is frequently cited amongst the worst films ever made. In 2006, in response to a question about the films Stallone wished he had not done, this film was the first one he mentioned. Plot Sergeant Joseph Andrew Bomowski (Sylvester Stallone) is a tough cop. His seemingly frail mother Tutti (Estelle Getty) comes to stay with him and progressively interferes in his life, driving him crazy. After cleaning his gun with bleach and finding out she ruined it, Tutti buys him an illegal MAC-10 machine pistol, and witnesses the murder of one of the men who sold her the gun. Tutti is taken to the police station to give a statement, and starts poking around in Joe's cases. She learns the gun she purchased was part of a collection taken from a burned building, and the gun insurance money was received. On her way back home, Tutti recognizes a man at the airport. He flees when she and Joe follow him, and Tutti remembers she saw him on America's Most Wanted for shooting his mother.

In October 2017, Schwarzenegger confirmed the rumor that, knowing the script was \\"really bad\\", he had publicly faked interest in starring for producers to lure Stallone. Reception =Box office= The film brought in $28.4 million in the US and over $42.2 million internationally for a total of $70.6 million worldwide. =Critical response= The film has a 7% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 27 reviews. The critical consensus reads: \\"Thoroughly witless and thuddingly unfunny, Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot gives its mismatched stars very little to work with - and as a result, they really don't work.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post called it \\"your worst nightmare\\" but stated that \\"the concept is actually better for Stallone than the premises of his earlier awful romps, Rhinestone and Oscar.\\" Clifford Terry wrote in the Chicago Tribune that the film \\"plays like an extended sitcom-perhaps four episodes of She's the Sheriff\\" and also that \\"About two- thirds into Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot, Sylvester Stallone actually delivers the title line. That's how numbingly awful this is. Give it half a star for being in focus.\\" Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film seemed like Stallone's response to Schwarzenegger's turn to comedies like Kindergarten Cop and added, \\"This is another 'high-concept' marketing hook job‚Äîa slick, slow-witted, shiny, 100% predictable movie‚Äîand the scriptwriters ... don't have anything richer on their minds than the usual feisty mother-son gags.\\"Wilmington, Michael (February 21, 1992). \\"'Stop!': Stallone KOs His Macho Image\\".

Ebert said it was \\"one of the worst movies he'd ever seen\\"; in his newspaper review (in which he awarded half of one star out of four), Ebert labeled it as \\"one of those movies so dimwitted, so utterly lacking in even the smallest morsel of redeeming value, that you stare at the screen in stunned disbelief. It is moronic beyond comprehension, an exercise in desperation during which even Sylvester Stallone, a repository of self- confidence, seems to be disheartened.\\" Siskel gave the film zero stars out of four and stated that if the script had been submitted to the staff of The Golden Girls, which co-starred Getty, it \\"would be summarily dismissed as too flimsy for a half-hour sitcom. There is not one laugh nor surprising moment to be found, starting with the scene where Stallone and Getty happen upon a jumper atop a building and Getty manages to bring the man down safely using a bullhorn.\\" Sylvester Stallone has stated that Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot was the worst film he had ever starred in. He told Ain't It Cool News that it was \\"maybe one of the worst films in the entire solar system, including alien productions we‚Äôve never seen\\", that \\"a flatworm could write a better script\\", and \\"in some countries ‚Äì China, I believe ‚Äì running [the movie] once a week on government television has lowered the birth rate to zero. If they ran it twice a week, I believe in twenty years China would be extinct.\\" =Accolades= It was the recipient of three Golden Raspberry Awards: Stallone as Worst Actor, Getty as Worst Supporting Actress, and the film earned Worst Screenplay. Other media =In popular culture= The film was mentioned when Stallone hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live in 1997; in one particular skit Stallone comes across someone in a terrible car accident (Norm Macdonald) who does not like any of his work and ridicules his films. As he lies dying, he mutters something quietly that only Stallone can hear, and when a passerby (Will Ferrell) asks what he said, Stallone is reluctant to say it until he is grilled some more, at which point he virulently yells \\"He said Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot...SUCKED!\\" The title of The Simpsons episode \\"Stop! Or My Dog Will Shoot\\" is a reference to the film. That episode involves the Simpsons' dog joining the Springfield Police Force after saving Homer from a corn maze.

This is described by the 'law of Bergoni√© and Tribondeau', formulated in 1906: X-rays are more effective on cells which have a greater reproductive activity. From their observations, they concluded that quickly dividing tumor cells are generally more sensitive than the majority of body cells. This is not always true. Tumor cells can be hypoxic and therefore less sensitive to X-rays because most of their effects are mediated by the free radicals produced by ionizing oxygen. It has meanwhile been shown that the most sensitive cells are those that are undifferentiated, well nourished, dividing quickly and highly active metabolically. Amongst the body cells, the most sensitive are spermatogonia and erythroblasts, epidermal stem cells, gastrointestinal stem cells. The least sensitive are nerve cells and muscle fibers. Very sensitive cells are also oocytes and lymphocytes, although they are resting cells and do not meet the criteria described above. The reasons for their sensitivity are not clear. There also appears to be a genetic basis for the varied vulnerability of cells to ionizing radiation. This has been demonstrated across several cancer types and in normal tissues. Cell damage classification The damage to the cell can be lethal (the cell dies) or sublethal (the cell can repair itself). Cell damage can ultimately lead to health effects which can be classified as either Tissue Reactions or Stochastic Effects according to the International Commission on Radiological Protection. =Tissue Reactions= Tissue reactions have a threshold of irradiation under which they do not appear and above which they typically appear. Fractionation of dose, dose rate, the application of antioxidants and other factors may affect the precise threshold at which a tissue reaction occurs. Tissue reactions include skin reactions (epilation, erythema, moist desquamation), cataracts, circulatory disease, and other conditions. =Stochastic effects= Stochastic effects do not have a threshold of irradiation, are coincidental, and cannot be avoided. They can be divided into somatic and genetic effects. Among the somatic effects, secondary cancer is the most important. It develops because radiation causes DNA mutations directly and indirectly. Direct effects are those caused by ionizing particles and rays themselves, while the indirect effects are those that are caused by free radicals, generated especially in water radiolysis and oxygen radiolysis. The genetic effects confer the predisposition of radiosensitivity to the offspring. The process is not well understood yet. = Target structures = For decades, the main cellular target for radiation induced damage was thought to be the DNA molecule. This view has been challenged by data indicating that in order to increase survival, the cells must protect their proteins, which in turn repair the damage in the DNA. An important part of protection of proteins (but not DNA) against the detrimental effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are the main mechanism of radiation toxicity, is played by non- enzymatic complexes of manganese ions and small organic metabolites. These complexes were shown to protect the proteins from oxidation in vitro and also increased radiation survival in mice. An application of the synthetically reconstituted protective mixture with manganese was shown to preserve the immunogenicity of viral and bacterial epitopes at radiation doses far above those necessary to kill the microorganisms, thus opening a possibility for a quick whole-organism vaccine production. The intracellular manganese content and the nature of complexes it forms (both measurable by electron paramagnetic resonance) were shown to correlate with radiosensitivity in bacteria, archaea, fungi and human cells. An association was also found between total cellular manganese contents and their variation, and clinically-inferred radioresponsiveness in different tumor cells, a finding that may be useful for more precise radiodosages and improved treatment of cancer patients.

Mare Imbrium is in the background. Vallis Alpes (Latin for \\"Alpine Valley\\") is a lunar valley feature that bisects the Montes Alpes range. It extends 166 km from the Mare Imbrium basin, trending east-northeast to the edge of the Mare Frigoris. The valley is narrow at both ends and widens to a maximum width of about 10 km along the middle stretch. The selenographic coordinates of the center of this feature are . The valley floor is a flat, lava-flooded surface that is bisected by a slender, broken, cleft-like rille. The center rille is a challenging target for telescope observation from the Earth and described as, \\"notoriously hard to spot.\\" The rille itself is longer than the valley proper, at 196.65 km ¬± 10.98 km, and has a width of 0.58 km ¬± 0.09 km and depth of 77.69 m ¬± 28.07 m. The sides of the valley rise from the floor to the surrounding highland terrain, a blocky, irregular surface. The southern face of the valley is straighter than the northern side, which is slightly bowed and uneven. The more rugged edges of the valley lie at the narrow west-southwest end that cuts through the mountain range. Most likely this valley is a graben that was subsequently flooded with magma from Mare Imbrium and Mare Frigoris. However, the valley could have been formed by stress fractures due to expansion of the mantle or contraction after solidification of regolith. It is not dissimilar to other linear features radiating from Mare Imbrium, and the impact event which created the Imbrium basin may have also led to the stresses creating Vallis Alpes. Lava flooding and thermal or tensional stress fractures are two causes of graben formation. This valley was discovered in 1727 by Francesco Bianchini.

As a Union Army General during the American Civil War, he revolutionized U.S. military transportation, particularly the use of railroads. Early and family life Haupt (whose first name was sometimes spelled Hermann) was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on March 26, 1817, the son of Jacob and Anna Margaretta Wiall Haupt. Jacob, a merchant, died when Herman was 12 years old, leaving Anna to support three sons and two daughters. Herman worked part-time to pay his school tuition, then in 1831 was appointed to the United States Military Academy at the age of 14 by President Andrew Jackson. He graduated in 1835 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Infantry that July. On August 30, 1838, in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, he married Ann Cecelia (Celia) Keller, with whom he would have seven sons and four daughters. In the 1870 census, Louis, Herman, Charles, Frank and Alex were living at home with their parents in Philadelphia's Ward 10, as were their sisters Mary and Ella.1870 U.S. Federal census for District 28, Ward 10, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, family 119 Early Career Haupt resigned his commission on September 30, 1835, to accept a job under Henry R Campbell as Assistant Engineer engaged in the surveys of the Allentown road and of the Norristown & Valley Railroad, which opened in 1835 and 15 years later merged into the Chester Valley railroad. At 19, he was appointed Assistant Engineer in the state service and surveyed the line from Gettysburg to the Potomac across the South Mountain, a right-of-way that became part of the Western Maryland Railroad. In 1839, Haupt patented a bridge construction technique called the Haupt Truss.In a letter to the U. S. Patent Office (\\"Specification of Letters Patent No. 1,445, dated December 27, 1839\\") Haupt explained his new construction method: \\"The construction of a lattice bridge without counterbraces, but consisting simply of braces inclined at any proposed angle and ties which are perpendicular to the lower chord, the chords being either straight or curved.\\" Sourced from North Carolina article on Bunker Hill Covered Bridge Two of his Haupt truss bridges, both built in 1854, still stand in Altoona and Ardmore, Pennsylvania. In 1840, Haupt was appointed a professor of mathematics and engineering at Pennsylvania College. He drew the attention of J. Edgar Thomson who became chief engineer of the Pennsylvania Railroad.George B. Abdill, Civil War Railroads: A Pictorial Story of the War Between the States, 1861-1865, (Indiana University Press 1961) p. 10 Haupt returned to the railroad business in 1847, accepting a position as construction engineer on the Pennsylvania Railroad, and then becoming its general superintendent from 1849 to 1851. Haupt and Thomson designed the Horseshoe Curve (now a National Historic Landmark) which enabled the Pennsylvania Railroad to cross the Allegheny Mountains and reach Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. From 1851 until 1853, Haupt was the chief engineer of the Southern Railroad of Mississippi, then became the Pennsylvania Railroad's chief engineer until 1856; in the latter position he completed the Mountain Division with the Allegheny Tunnel, opening the line through to Pittsburgh. He was the chief engineer on the five-mile (8 km) Hoosac Tunnel project through the Berkshires in Western Massachusetts from 1856 to 1861. Civil War The locomotive, \\"General Haupt\\" is being used for work detail while its namesake, Herman Haupt, stands on the hill to the right inspecting railway work near Bull Run in 1863 In the spring of 1862, a year after the start of the Civil War, the U.S. War Department organized a new bureau responsible for constructing and operating military railroads in the United States. On April 27, Haupt was appointed chief of the bureau by Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, as a colonel and aide-de-camp to major general Irvin McDowell, then in command of the defenses of Washington, D.C. Haupt repaired and fortified war-damaged railroad lines in the vicinity of Washington, armed and trained railroad staff, and improved telegraph communications along the railroad lines. Among his most challenging assignments was restoring the strategic Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad line, including the Potomac Creek Bridge, after its partial destruction by Confederate forces. Despite an inexperienced workforce and other serious impediments, Haupt had the line back in use in under two weeks. President Abraham Lincoln was impressed with Haupt's work there. In a visit on May 28, 1862, he observed: \\"That man Haupt has built a bridge four hundred feet long and one hundred feet high, across Potomac Creek, on which loaded trains are passing every hour, and upon my word, gentlemen, there is nothing in it but cornstalks and beanpoles.\\" Military railroad bridge restored over Potomac Creek. Haupt was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on September 5, 1862, but he officially refused the appointment, explaining that he would be happy to serve without official rank or pay, but he did not want to limit his freedom to work in private business (and he privately bridled at the protocols and discipline of Army service). He worked with Gen. Daniel McCallum, a fellow railroad man and later became good friends with John H. Devereux (the Superintendent of the United States Military Railroad at Alexandria, Virginia and later General Superintendent of the Cleveland & Pittsburgh Railroad). However, he chafed dealing with other Union army commanders. He also preferred civilian crews, including many of former slaves (\\"contraband negroes\\") to soldiers. His Construction Corps had 300 men divided into 10 man squads by June 1862, and was later enlarged to include bridge- builders, then construction of freight cars, barracks, wharves, warehouses, etc. and extended to Tennessee and accompanied Sherman's thrust through Georgia under the direction of Colonel William Wierman Wright and division engineer Eben C. Smeed.Abdill pp.10-11, 53, 82 Haupt also experimented with bridge demolition using torpedoes (inserted in holes drilled in trusses) and also discussed in a November 1862 report various methods of destroying locomotives (firing a cannon ball through the boiler was irreparable; locomotives with fireboxes drained then fired could be repaired). He also tested a lightweight 2-clamp \\"rail-twister\\" invented by his subordinate Eben C. Smeed, Reminiscences of General Herman Haupt Wright & Joys, 1901 pp. 198 for use in raids behind enemy lines.Abdill pp. 45, 56 Offered promotion again in early autumn 1863, Haupt hinged his acceptance on three conditions: that a central Bureau of U.S. Military Railroads be established to inspect, direct, and receive reports concerning construction and operation of all military railroads; difficulties with commanding generals be avoided through consultation and cooperation within their departments; the chief of the bureau should be free to move wherever his personal presence was necessary or to attend to whatever public or private business required his attention.National Archives, RG 108, Entry 22, M1635, Herman Haupt to Edwin M. Stanton, September 11, 1863; Herman Haupt to Henry W. Halleck, September 11, 1863 The War Department declined to accept such terms. Haupt's appointment was eventually rescinded on September 5, 1863, and he left the service on September 14. During that year as a general, however, he made an enormous impact on the Union war effort. The Civil War was one of the first wars in which large-scale railroad transportation was used to move and supply armies rapidly over long distances. Haupt assisted the Union Army of Virginia and Army of the Potomac in the Northern Virginia Campaign, the Maryland Campaign, and was particularly effective in supporting the Gettysburg Campaign, conducted in an area he knew well from his youth. His hastily organized trains kept the Union Army well supplied, and he organized the returning trains to carry thousands of Union wounded to hospitals. After the Battle of Gettysburg, Haupt boarded one of his trains and arrived at the White House on July 6, 1863, becoming the first to inform President Lincoln that General Robert E. Lee's defeated Confederate army was not being pursued vigorously by Union Major General George G. Meade. During his service, Haupt developed and implemented \\"general principles of railroad supply operation\\" and \\"also detailed methods of construction and destruction of railroad equipment\\". His two main principles were that the military should never interfere with the efficient running of the railroad and that rolling stock should be emptied and returned promptly to enable their re- use as transport. Postbellum After his war service, Haupt returned to railroad, bridge, pipeline, and tunnel construction. He worked with the Richmond and Danville Railroad then was the general manager of Piedmont Air- Line Railway (from Richmond, Virginia, to Atlanta, Georgia), 1872 to 1876; Tide Water Pipe Line Company, 1875- ; general manager of the transcontinental Northern Pacific Railroad, 1881 to 1885; president of the Dakota and Great Southern Railroad, 1885 to 1886. Haupt became wealthy from investments in railroads, mining, and Pennsylvania real estate, but eventually lost most of his fortune, in part due to political complications involving the completion of the Hoosac Tunnel. He and his wife purchased a small resort hotel at Mountain Lake in Giles County, Virginia. He invented a drilling machine that won the highest prize of the Royal Polytechnic Society of Great Britain and was the first to prove the practicability of transporting oil in pipes. Haupt also authored several papers and books: Hints on Bridge Building (1840), The General Theory of Bridge Construction (1851), Plan for the Improvement of the Ohio River (1855), Military Briges (1864) and Reminiscences (1901).Appleton's Cyclopedia vol 3, p. 116 Abdill p. 10 Death and legacy Haupt died of a heart attack at age 88 in Jersey City, New Jersey, stricken while traveling on the Pennsylvania Railroad in a Pullman car named \\"Irma\\" on a journey from New York to Philadelphia. He is buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.Civil War High Commands His son Lewis M. Haupt was a noted civil engineer and professor.

It is a type of sieve where up to half of all residue classes of numbers are removed, as opposed to small sieves such as the Selberg sieve wherein only a few residue classes are removed. The method has been further heightened by the larger sieve which removes arbitrarily many residue classes. Name Its name comes from its original application: given a set S \\\\subset \\\\\\\\{ 1,\\\\ldots,N \\\\\\\\} such that the elements of S are forbidden to lie in a set Ap ‚äÇ Z/p Z modulo every prime p, how large can S be? Here Ap is thought of as being large, i.e., at least as large as a constant times p; if this is not the case, we speak of a small sieve.  History  The early history of the large sieve traces back to work of Yu. B. Linnik, in 1941, working on the problem of the least quadratic non-residue. Subsequently Alfr√©d R√©nyi worked on it, using probability methods. It was only two decades later, after quite a number of contributions by others, that the large sieve was formulated in a way that was more definitive. This happened in the early 1960s, in independent work of Klaus Roth and Enrico Bombieri. It is also around that time that the connection with the duality principle became better understood. In the mid-1960s, the Bombieri‚ÄìVinogradov theorem was proved as a major application of large sieves using estimations of mean values of Dirichlet characters. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, many of the key ingredients and estimates were simplified by Patrick X. Gallagher.  Development  Large-sieve methods have been developed enough that they are applicable to small-sieve situations as well. Something is commonly seen as related to the large sieve not necessarily in terms of whether it is related to the kind of situation outlined above, but, rather, if it involves one of the two methods of proof traditionally used to yield a large-sieve result: =Approximate Plancherel inequality= If a set S is ill-distributed modulo p (by virtue, for example, of being excluded from the congruence classes Ap) then the Fourier coefficients \\\\widehat{f_p}(a) of the characteristic function fp of the set S mod p are in average large. These coefficients can be lifted to values \\\\widehat{f}(a/p) of the Fourier transform \\\\widehat{f} of the characteristic function f of the set S (i.e., :\\\\widehat{f}(a/p)=\\\\widehat{f_p}(a)). By bounding derivatives, we can see that \\\\widehat{f}(x) must be large, on average, for all x near rational numbers of the form a/p. Large here means \\"a relatively large constant times S\\". Since :f_2 = \\\\sqrt{S}, we get a contradiction with the Plancherel identity :\\\\widehat{f}_2=f_2 unless S is small. (In practice, to optimise bounds, people nowadays modify the Plancherel identity into an equality rather than bound derivatives as above.) =Duality principle= One can prove a strong large-sieve result easily by noting the following basic fact from functional analysis: the norm of a linear operator (i.e., :\\\\sup_v Av_W/v_V, \\\\, where A is an operator from a linear space V to a linear space W) equals the norm of its adjoint i.e., :\\\\sup_w A^* w^*_V/w^*_W). This principle itself has come to acquire the name \\"large sieve\\" in some of the mathematical literature. It is also possible to derive the large sieve from majorants in the style of Selberg (see Selberg, Collected Works, vol II, Lectures on sieves).

It represents a luxurious residence with a highly organised economy. Excavations have revealed a villa with peristyle, thermae, granary and water tower. The residence dates to the reign of Constantine the Great 306 to 337. Although Roman artifacts can be found scattered all over the area of present-day Ni≈°, Mediana represents the best-preserved part of Roman Naissus. In 1979, Mediana was added to the Archaeological Sites of Exceptional Importance list, protected by the Republic of Serbia. History Constantine the Great (280‚Äì337) was born and raised in Naissus. He erected a majestic residence in one of the luxurious suburbs of ancient Naissus, where he often resided and attended to state affairs. Historical records testify it was in Naissus that he passed several laws ‚Äì in 315, 319, 324, and 334. After Constantine's death in 337, the imperial residence in Mediana was used by several other emperors, either as a place of rest on their long journeys or during preparations for war. Thus, Constantine's sons, Constantius II and Constans, stayed in Naissus in the winter of 340, for they signed an edict there. Later on, Constans used it as a temporary residence. According to the Hieronimus' Chronicles, after Vetranio, commander of the Danubian army, had been proclaimed emperor in Sirmium, he surrendered the insignia of imperial power to Constantius II in Naissus, doubtless at the imperial villa, in 350. Julian the Apostate unexpectedly spent some time in Naissus on his expedition against Constantius II, at the end of 361. During his two-month stay, Julian wrote from Naissus long epistles to the Senate, to Athens, Corinth and other Greek towns, explaining his policy and seeking support. Valentinian's stay in Naissus in 364 is attested by several imperial edicts. According to Olympiodorus of Thebes, Naissus was the native town of another Roman emperor ‚Äì Constantius III, husband of Galla Placidia, father of Valentinian III. In 364 AD, Imperial Villa Mediana was the site where emperors Valentinian and Valens met and divided the Roman Empire and ruled as co-emperorshttp://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/gibbon/02/daf02049.htm The residence was abandoned after the city of Naissus was devastated by Attila's hordes in 442. Site thumb The residence was erected on flat terrain, on an area which covers over 400,000 square metres, on a high bank, some distance from the river, at the foot of the hills which frame the Ni≈°ava Valley, near a thermal water source. There was a street in the east-west direction which passed on the south side of the villa with peristyle and the granary located 150 metres from it. From this street it was possible to approach these buildings. The central area was occupied by the villa with its open peristyle, nymphaeum and thermae; to the west of the villa was the granary, and somewhat to the north a spacious building with octagonal and circular rooms. To the south of the villa are the remains of several villas and functional service structures. What strikes the eye is that the luxurious buildings of solid material with columns, decorated with marble facing, mosaics and frescoes, are concentrated mainly around the central villa and its peristyle, while the economic buildings are located to the west of the granary towards Naissus. =Villa= Ruins of Mediana. The villa occupies the central position in Mediana. The villa comprises an area of about 6.000 m¬≤ (98,6 x 63 m) and included thermae on the west side and a smaller nymphaeum on the east side. The longitudinal axis of the villa is in the north-south direction. The whole northern part was heated. The villa was luxuriously decorated, to which testify the marble columns, basis and capitals of different sizes, reliefs on pilaster capitals and parapet slabs, the remains of wall covering of expensive, multicoloured marble, frescoes, etc. The mosaic floors that covered the whole of the peristyle porch (450 m¬≤) and the audience room have been well preserved. The porch mosaics are geometrical. Figural mosaics are at the entrance of the audience room. The middle part of the audience hall is covered with a broad rectangular field with a geometric pattern, done in the manner of the finest artist. The central part of this structure is a hexagon (3,2 m on the side) with a fountain in the middle, also in the form of hexagon. The lead pipe, used to supply water, can be seen in the middle of the fountain. Smaller spaces surround the hexagon; one of their sides is the polygon of the hexagon. The floor of the nymphaeum is covered with mosaic. The wide outer frame of the hexagon is covered with alternating stylized lotus flowers, and is underlined on the inner side, by a triple border. The lateral spaces about the hexagon are also decorated by mosaic. =Thermae= Thermae are situated northwest of the villa and were probably connected to it. The entrance to the bath is from the south side. The thermae of Mediana were probably used by the owners of the villa, who could reach them directly from their rooms. The corridor on the way to the baths is decorated by floor mosaics, with geometric patterns of the same quality as the mosaics in the peristyle. The vestibule and apodyterium are covered by brick and the middle room is partly covered with brick and partly with mosaic made here of larger white marble tessarae. =Granary= The Granary (horreum) is located about 150 metres west of the villa. This is a spacious rectangular building (91 x 27 m), with the longitudinal axis oriented east-west. Along the west wall there were basins 1.40 m deep, which served for storing liquids, (olive oil and wine). =Water tower= A water tower (castellum aquae) was ordinarily found at the end of each Roman aqueduct. Water was supplied from this reservoir to the wells and fountains, basins, thermae and maybe the irrigation canals. Its longitudinal axis is oriented north-south. There is a 10-meter height differential between the water tower site and the valley in which the Mediana buildings are located, providing a head for the fountains. =Churches= Two Early Christian churches have been excavated, both built simultaneously sometime after 378. The first church was unearthed in 2000, when a monogram of Jesus was found. Only 8 metres south of the first, a second church was excavated in 2007, among the findings was a bronze ring with a cross. The findings are evidence of Mediana being a highly Christian community.http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Kultura/t29071.lt.html As of July 2019 the site is closed for visitors with information it is under construction works but without a re-opening date indicated.

C. Penney stores in 1902. Early life J. C. Penney was born on September 16, 1875, on a farm outside of Hamilton, Caldwell County, Missouri. He was the seventh of twelve children, only six of whom lived to adulthood, born to James Cash Penney Sr. and Mary Frances (born Paxton) Penney. Penney's father was a Baptist preacher and farmer whose strict discipline included making his son pay for his own clothing once he reached his late pre-teens. After graduation from Hamilton High School, Penney intended to attend college with the hopes of becoming a lawyer. However, his father's untimely death forced a change in plans, and Penney was forced to take a job as a store clerk to help support the family. Penney's health problems caused him to venture west to Longmont, Colorado.Brown, John W. Missouri Legends: Famous People From The Show-Me State. Reedy Press: St. Louis, 2008. J. C. Penney stores J. C. Penney mother store in Kemmerer, Wyoming. In 1898, James Cash Penney began working for a small chain of stores in the western United States called the Golden Rule stores. In 1902, owners Guy Johnson and Thomas Callahan, impressed by his work ethic and salesmanship, offered him a one-third partnership in a new store he would open. Penney invested $2,000 and moved to Kemmerer, Wyoming, to open a store there. He participated in opening two more stores, and when Callahan and Johnson dissolved their partnership in 1907 he purchased full interest in all three stores. By 1912, there were 34 stores in the Rocky Mountain States. In 1913, he moved the company to the Kearns Building in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah. The company was incorporated under the new name, J. C. Penney Company. In 1916, he began to expand the chain east of the Mississippi and during the 1920s, the Penney company expanded nationwide, with 120 stores in 1920 (mostly still in the west). By 1924, Penney reported income of more than $1 million annually. The number of stores reached 1,400 by 1929. The large income allowed him to be heavily involved in many philanthropic causes during the 1920s. By 1921 he had a home (Belle Isle) on Biscayne Bay in Miami. Penney and partner Ralph W. Gwinn had invested heavily in Florida real estate including in Clay County. Some of this land became Penney Farms. This was also the start of Foremost Dairy Products Inc. Penney later recruited Paul E. Reinhold to run the dairy. Most of this work was halted when the stock market crash of 1929 and the Clutch Plague left Penney in financial ruin. After the crash, Penney lost virtually all of his personal wealth and borrowed against his life insurance policies to help the company meet its payroll. The financial setbacks took a toll on his health, and he checked himself into the Battle Creek Sanitarium for treatment. After hearing the hymn \\"God Will Take Care of You\\" (written by Civilla Durfee Martin) being sung at a service in the hospital's chapel, he became a born-again Christian. Even after relinquishing daily operating management of the company, Penney continued his active involvement in managing the company and its stores. In 1940, during a visit to a store in Des Moines, Iowa, he trained a young Sam Walton on how to wrap packages with a minimal amount of paper and ribbon. He remained chairman of the board until 1946, and after that, as honorary chairman until his death in 1971. Until the end of his life, he continued to go to his offices. Penney directed his stores to be closed on Sunday so employees could attend church. Personal life Boyhood home in Hamilton (that was moved from a farm to town for display) Penney was married three times. His first marriage, to Bertha Alva Hess (1869‚Äì1910) in 1899, produced two sons before her death from pneumonia: * Roswell Kemper Penney (1901‚Äì1971), who married Willa Graff. * James Cash Penney III (1903‚Äì1938), who married Louise Ducoudray in 1927. After Bertha's death in 1910, he married Mary Hortense Kimball (d. 1923) in July 1919. Mary gave birth to their son before her death of unspecified medical issues: * Kimball Penney (1920‚Äì1979) In 1926, Penney married Caroline Marie Autenrieth (1895‚Äì1992). She was badly hurt in 1928 when she fell from a horse at their estate in White Plains. They had two daughters: * Mary Frances Penney (b. 1927), a professor of chemistry who obtained a PhD from Oxford University and a bachelor's degree from MIT, was married Dr. Philip Franklin Wagley, son of Everitt F. Wagley, in 1953. * Carol Marie Penney (1929‚Äì2002),\\"Carol Penney Guyer, 72; Philanthropist, Daughter of Retailer\\". Los Angeles Times. July 20, 2002. who earned a degree in international relations from Stanford University, and was married to David Guyer, attach√© of the United Nations Technical Mission at Delhi. Penney lived in New York City at 888 Park Avenue, though he spent the winters in Palm Springs, California. On December 26, 1970, Penney fell and fractured his hip. Just a few weeks later, he suffered a heart attack and never fully recovered. He died on February 12, 1971. The Reverend Dr. Norman Vincent Peale delivered the eulogy at the funeral. Penney was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City, not far from that of fellow retail entrepreneur, F. W. Woolworth. His estate was valued at approximately $35 million.  Affiliations  Penney was a Freemason most of his adult life, being initiated into Wasatch Lodge No. 1 Free and Accepted Masons of Utah, on April 18, 1911. A member of both the Scottish and York Rites, Penney was coroneted a 33rd Degree on October 16, 1945, and received the Gold Distinguished Service Award by the General Grand Chapter, Royal Arch Masons, in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1958. He typically wore a large ring showing his Masonic degree. Penney was a member of two professional collegiate fraternities: Alpha Gamma Rho for agriculture and Alpha Kappa Psi for business. Penney was involved with the founding of the University of Miami and served on its Board of Trustees from 1926 to 1930.Tebeau, Charlton W. The University of Miami. Coral Gables: University of Miami Press, 1976. p. 393. At the end of the Great Depression, Penney teamed with Thomas J. Watson, President and Founder of IBM, Arthur Godfrey, the radio and TV personality; and Norman Vincent Peale, a minister, inspirational speaker, and author of The Power of Positive Thinking, to help Henry Simler, an executive with the Remington Rand company.New York Times obituary of Henry Simler, June 27, 1954. \\"Henry Simler, 78, Is Dead on Coast\\" form the first board of 40Plus, an organization that helps unemployed managers and executives. Penney founded the James C. Penney Foundation in 1954. The foundation was restructured in 1999 as the Penney Family Fund, and is no longer affiliated with J. C. Penney Co., Inc., or its corporate giving program. Today, the fund is part of the Common Counsel Foundation, an Oakland, California, consortium of family philanthropic foundations and individual donors. The Penney Family Fund endows organizations in Oregon, California, and Washington state that work to advance human rights, community social, political, economic empowerment, government accountability, and environmental sustainability. In 1960 Penney teamed up with the University of Missouri to establish the Penney-Missouri Awards to recognize excellence in Women's Page journalism, hoping to improve the sections where his stores most often advertised. Commemoration * The J. C. Penney Conference Center at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was dedicated in his honor on January 23, 1972. The building was made possible through financial donations by Mr. Penney and his company. * Mr. Penney was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1976. * In 1926, Penney founded a retirement community in Northeast Florida for retired ministers, in honor of his father. Today that community is still in existence, bearing his name, and is located in the town that also bears his name, Penney Farms, Florida. * The J. C.

The company was the prototype for other local illuminating companies that were established in the United States during the 1880s.  History  = Pearl Street Station = A sketch of the Pearl Street Station On September 4, 1882, Edison's first central station, the Pearl Street Station, opened at 257 Pearl Street in Manhattan. The station was the first commercial power plant in the United States, and was the world's first cogeneration plant. The plant burned down on January 2 1890. Only 1 dynamo (or generator) survived, and is currently displayed at the Henry Ford Museum. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers designated it as a milestone in 2011. = Other stations = In November 1882, the Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Shamokin, Pennsylvania was established. In 1883, it became only the second three-wire electrical station in the world. The first was Edison's plant in Sunbury, Pennsylvania, which opened on July 4, 1883. The opening ceremony was attended by Edison himself. Even today, Edison's presence is remembered throughout the town, with the Edison Hotel and a monument just outside Sunbury. On October 1, 1883, the Brockton Edison Electric Illuminating Company Power Station, another three-wire plant, opened in Brockton, Massachusetts and was capable of supplying about 1600 lamps. The Brockton station is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. On November 17, 1883, the Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania was founded. This was the first isolated electrical plant in the world, meaning that the entirety of Mount Carmel was powered by electricity. 38 arc lamps and 50 incandescent light bulbs were erected in the downtown business district. Edison also opened plants in Fall River, Massachusetts (1883), Cumberland, Maryland (1884), Tamaqua, Pennsylvania (1885), and Boston (1886). = Fate = The Edison Illuminating Company was purchased by Consolidated Gas in 1901. In 1936, with electricity sales far outpacing gas sales, the company changed its name to Consolidated Edison. Today, Con Ed is a multi-billion dollar company that provides power to around 3.3 million people.  Notable employees  In 1891, Henry Ford became an engineer with the Edison Illuminating Company, and was promoted to Chief Engineer in 1893. He left the company on August 15, 1899 to focus on automobile manufacturing. James Hood Wright was a board member of the company.

The technology allows up to four GPUs to be used in a single computer to improve graphics performance. Associated technology used in mobile computers with external graphics cards, such as in laptops or notebooks, is called AMD Hybrid Graphics. The CrossFire brand name was retired by AMD in September 2017, however the company continues to develop and support the technology for DirectX 11 applications. Configurations =First- generation= CrossFire was first made available to the public on September 27, 2005. The system required a CrossFire-compliant motherboard with a pair of ATI Radeon PCI Express (PCIe) graphics cards. Radeon x800s, x850s, x1800s and x1900s came in a regular edition, and a \\"CrossFire Edition\\" which has \\"master\\" capability built into the hardware. \\"Master\\" capability is a term used for 5 extra image compositing chips, which combine the output of both cards. One had to buy a Master card, and pair it with a regular card from the same series. The Master card shipped with a proprietary DVI Y-dongle, which plugged into the primary DVI ports on both cards, and into the monitor cable. This dongle serves as the main link between both cards, sending incomplete images between them, and complete images to the monitor. Low-end Radeon x1300 and x1600 cards have no \\"CrossFire Edition\\" but are enabled via software, with communication forwarded via the standard PCI Express slots on the motherboard. ATI currently has not created the infrastructure to allow FireGL cards to be set up in a CrossFire configuration. The \\"slave\\" graphics card needed to be from the same family as the \\"master\\". An example of a limitation in regard to a Master-card configuration would be the first-generation CrossFire implementation in the Radeon X850 XT . Because it used a compositing chip from Silicon Image (SiI 163B TMDS), the maximum resolution on an X850 CrossFire setup was limited to 1600√ó1200 at 60 Hz, or 1920√ó1440 at 52 Hz. This was considered a problem for CRT owners wishing to use CrossFire to play games at high resolutions, or owners of Widescreen LCD monitors. As many people found a 60 Hz refresh rate with a CRT to strain one's eyes, the practical resolution limit became 1280√ó1024, which did not push CrossFire enough to justify the cost. The next generation of CrossFire, as employed by the X1800 Master cards, used two sets of compositing chips and a custom double density dual-link DVI Y-dongle to double the bandwidth between cards, raising the maximum resolution and refresh rate to far higher levels. =Second-generation (Software CrossFire)= When used with ATI's \\"CrossFire Xpress 3200\\" motherboard chipset, the \\"master\\" card is no longer required for every \\"CrossFire Ready\\" card (with the exception of the Radeon X1900 series). With the CrossFire Xpress 3200, two normal cards can be run in a Crossfire setup, using the PCI Express bus for communications. This is similar to X1300 CrossFire, which also uses PCI Express, except that the Xpress 3200 had been built for low-latency and high-speed communication between graphics cards. While performance was impacted, this move was viewed as an overall improvement in market strategy, because Crossfire Master cards were expensive, in high demand, and largely unavailable at the retail level. Although the CrossFire Xpress 3200 chipset is indeed capable of CrossFire through the PCI Express bus for every Radeon series below the X1900s, the driver accommodations for this CrossFire method have not yet materialized for the X1800 series. ATI has said that future revisions of the Catalyst driver suite will contain what is required for X1800 dongleless CrossFire, but has not yet mentioned a specific date. = Third-generation (CrossFireX) = A CrossFireX connection on a graphics card Top view alt=AMD CrossFireX and some R700 GPUs, in Radeon HD 4000 Series RV770 GPU) With the release of the Radeon X1950 Pro (RV570 GPU), ATI has completely revised CrossFire's connection infrastructure to further eliminate the need for past Y-dongle/Master card and slave card configurations for CrossFire to operate. ATI's CrossFire connector (CrossFire Bridge Interconnect, or CFBI link) is now a ribbon-like connector attached to the top of each graphics adapter, similar to nVidia's SLI bridges, but different in physical and logical natures. As such, Master Cards no longer exist, and are not required for maximum performance. Two dongles can be used per card; these were put to full use with the release of CrossFireX. Radeon HD 2900 and HD 3000 series cards use the same ribbon connectors, but the HD 3800 series of cards only require one ribbon connector, to facilitate CrossFireX. Unlike older series of Radeon cards, different HD 3800 series cards can be combined in CrossFireX, each with separate clock control. Since the release of the codenamed Spider desktop platform from AMD on November 19, 2007, the CrossFire setup has been updated with support for a maximum of four video cards with the 790FX chipset; the CrossFire branding was then changed to \\"ATI CrossFireX\\". The setup, which, according to internal testing by AMD, will bring at least 3.2x performance increase in several games and applications which required massive graphics capabilities of the computer system, is targeted to the enthusiast market. A later development to the CrossFire infrastructure includes a dual GPUs with on-board PCI Express bridge that was released in early 2008, the Radeon HD 3870 X2 and later in Radeon HD 4870 X2 graphics cards, featuring only one CrossFire connector for dual card, four GPU scalability. When using two GPUs on board the same system, the HDMI ports on the GPUs cannot both work at the same time. An earlier CrossFireX and chipset compatibility chart is shown here: The latest compatibility charts, as of April 2014, shows AMD 890, 990 and A75 chipsetsand many Intel chipsets including Z68 and X79 chipsetsas being compatible with CrossFireX; they also show which GPU cards may be paired with an external bridge (HD 7750, HD 5750, HD 4350, HD 4550, HD 4650, HD 4670 cards may be paired without an external bridge, though the charts also indicate that some models manufactured by other than AMD may still require the bridge). = Fourth generation (XDMA) = XDMA might be similar the AMD DirectGMA (Direct Graphics Memory Access) to be found on AMD FirePro, and Radeon Pro branded product lines. The Radeon R9 290 and R9 290X graphics cards (released on October 24, 2013 and based on Graphics Core Next 1.1 \\"Volcanic Islands\\") as well as GPUs using newer versions of GCN no longer have bridging ports. Instead, they use XDMA to open a direct channel of communication between the multiple GPUs in a system, operating over the same PCI Express bus which is used by AMD Radeon graphics cards. PCI Express 3.0 lanes provide up to 17.5 times higher bandwidth (15.754 GB/s for a √ó16 slot) when compared to current external bridges (900 MB/s), rendering the use of a CrossFire bridge unnecessary. Thus, XDMA was selected for greater GPU interconnection bandwidth demands generated by AMD Eyefinity, and more recently by 4K resolution monitors. Bandwidth of the data channel opened by XDMA is fully dynamic, scaling itself together with the demands of the game being played, as well as adapting to advanced user settings such as vertical synchronization (vsync). Additionally, some newer cards are capable of pairing with 7000-series cards based on the Graphics Core Next 1.0 \\"Southern Islands\\" architecture. For example, an R9-280X card can be used in a CrossFireX setup together with a HD 7970 card, largely due to them being the same product at different clock rates. GPUOpen offers some MIT-licensed source-code for DirectGMA stuff with multiple AMD GPUs in conjunction with Direct3D 11, OpenGL and OpenCL: https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/DirectGMA_P2P  Hybrid CrossFireX (dual graphics)  There is also a \\"hybrid\\" mode of CrossFireX that combines on-board graphics using the AMD northbridge architecture with select graphic cards, for increased performance. The current generation is called Hybrid CrossFireX and is available for motherboards with integrated AMD chipsets in the 7 and 8 series GPUs, referred to as Hybrid CrossFireX.Triple Hybrid CrossfireX working AMD forums, retrieved 23 September 2010 This combination results in power-savings when simple or 2D graphics are used and performance increases of 25% to over 200% in 3D graphics over using a non CrossFire option. As of March 2012, it appears that this is now called \\"AMD Radeon Dual Graphics\\" and means using A-series Fusion APUs together with video cards. Comparisons to Nvidia SLI =Similarities= In some cases CrossFire doesn't improve 3D performance ‚Äì in some extreme cases, it can lower the framerate due to the particulars of an application's coding. This is also true for Nvidia's SLI, as the problem is inherent in multi-GPU systems. This is often witnessed when running an application at low resolutions. When using CrossFire with AFR, the subjective framerate can often be lower than the framerate reported by benchmarking applications, and may even be poorer than the frame rate of its single-GPU equivalent. This phenomenon is known as micro stuttering and also applies to SLI since it is inherent to multi-GPU configurations. AMD CrossFireX, and NVIDIA SLI setups both require bridges, and a power supply unit (PSU) capable of supplying enough power to the GPUs. 6 pin (75 watt 3+3, becoming rare now), 8 pin (150 watt 4+4), and 16 pin (300 watt 8+8) power plugs are all common in today's graphics cards. =Advantages= CrossFire can be implemented with GPU cards of the same generation, and manufacture (this is compared to Nvidia's SLI, which generally only works if all cards have the same GPU, and brand). This allows buyers who have varying budgets over time to purchase different cards and still get the benefits of increased performance. With the latest generation cards, they will only crossfire with other cards in their sub series. For example, GPU in the same series can be crossfired with each other. So a 5800 series GPU (e.g. a 5830) can run together with another 5800 series GPU (e.g. 5870). However, GPUs not in the same hundred series cannot be crossfired successfully (e.g. a 5770 cannot run with a 5870). The only exception is that the HD 7870 XT cards can be used with a HD 7900 series GPU (e.g., a 7950) in a crossfire configuration because they feature the same GPU. AMD CrossFire, and SLI configurations can run many monitors of varying size and resolutions. Both SLI , and CrossFire setups only allow up to four 8K (7680x4320) monitors, or eight 4K monitors (3840x2160). Each monitor requires its own dedicated graphics card (except for 4K, and standard HD), in that case up to two monitors can be on one dedicated graphics card. =Disadvantages= Major downside of CrossFire is that it works only in fullscreen mode, requiring extrinsic support for software or games when run in borderless/windowed mode. The first generation CrossFire implementations (the Radeon X800 to X1900 series) require an external y-cable/dongle to operate in CrossFire mode due to the PCI Express bus not being able to provide enough bandwidth to run CrossFire without losing a significant amount of performance.

During the Crisis on Infinite Earths he protects multiple sectors, but found the experience depressing. After this, he went to Earth looking for company amongst his fellow Green Lanterns. He served with the contingent of Green Lanterns assigned to Earth and became good friends with Ch'p of H'lven. For a time Salaak lived in the future, filling the identity of Pol Manning as Hal Jordan had before him. While in the future, Salaak was married to a human woman. Salaak returns to the present day to warn about the destruction of the Corps. He was too late to stop the execution of Sinestro. The Central Power Battery on Oa ends up destroyed, and with it, Salaak's ring is made inoperable. He finds transport to H'lven where he reunites with Ch'p, one of the few Lanterns whose ring still functioned. Salaak remains on H'lven and acts as Ch'p's advisor until they discover that the Guardians have returned and have rebuilt the Corps. The two later petition for reinstatement, but Ch'p is killed in a traffic accident. The Corps is destroyed again when Hal Jordan, crazed with grief at the loss of friends, became the entity known as Parallax. Hal's activities caused the shutdown of the Oan battery again and Salaak, along with all other Green Lanterns, were left powerless. Salaak ends up captured, along with multiple other Green Lanterns and one Darkstar. They are scheduled to be sold into slavery but former Green Lantern Guy Gardner, with powers underived from a Power Ring, rescues the entire group. =Promotion= Salaak attends Hal's memorial service on Earth. The Corps, reformed again, has Salaak as the senior administrator and the Keeper of the Book of Oa. The Book tells of the adventures of multiple Green Lanterns throughout the history of the universe. Salaak reinforces the squadron of Lanterns sent to save Mogo from Ranx the Sentient City and other Sinestro Corps members (Sinestro having returned from the dead). He has expressed displeasure at the fact that the Guardians have rewritten the Book of Oa to allow lethal force against members of the Sinestro Corps, but is still committed to serve. He survived the Sinestro Corps War without major injuries, and he continues to hold on to his position as keeper of the Book of Oa. He is kept out of the loop in some instances by the Guardians who neglected to tell him their plans to create the Alpha Lanterns. He is seen getting into an argument with Guy Gardner over a bar he wishes to open. Salaak quickly disapproves, which leads Guy to use his ring to make a miniaturized version of Salaak mocking him for \\"hanging out with midgets\\". Salaak is seen in Final Crisis #5 as part of the trial of Hal Jordan. During the Blackest Night, Oa comes under siege from the Black Lantern Corps.Blackest Night #1 With the Guardians missing, Salaak takes command of the Green Lantern Corps as Clarissi and thus the next in succession after the Guardians, preventing the Alpha Lanterns' attempt to take control. As his first command decision, Salaak decrees that all fallen Lantern rings be sent to Mogo, so as not to endanger any new recruits.Green Lantern Corps (Vol. 2) #40 After the War of the Green Lanterns, Salaak went along with the Guardians' orders to prepare a space for Krona in the Green Lantern memorial hall despite the other Corps members' anger at such a decision, despite Salaak claiming that the Guardians want to remember the good that Krona did in helping to found the Corps rather than the evil he committed later, with the other Corps members denouncing him for his blind loyalty.War of the Green Lanterns: Aftermath #1War of the Green Lanterns: Aftermath #2 When Kyle Rayner is briefly turned into a ring magnet, Salaak attempts to remove Kyle's Green Lantern ring on the Guardians' orders. Kyle's ring resists Salaak's attempt at removal as Kyle protests the decision and what they did to Ganthet.Green Lantern: New Guardians #3 (November 2011) Later, Salaak assigns the Green Lantern B'dg to find Hal Jordan on Earth and discovers that the green rings are being delayed under the authorization of the Guardians to which he also secretly informs Kilowog of these events.Green Lantern Corps vol. 3 #14 (November 2012) Concerned at recent events, Salaak begins to spy on the Guardians, learning of their plans for the Third Army. He is subsequently caught and locked away despite his protests that their plans are wrong.Green Lantern Corps vol. 3 #15 (December 2012) After the unemotional Guardians are killed off by Sinestro, Salaak is freed from his imprisonment by Kilowog and Guy Gardner, who explain to him the events regarding the villainous First Lantern. Later, Salaak helps Guy search for his old arch-enemy, Xar. Guy slays Xar on Earth.Green Lantern Corps vol. 3 #20 (May 2013) As with most Lanterns, Salakk is lost in the dying universe proceeding this one. He is fortunate to be one of the few Lanterns on the thriving, living Lantern world Mogo, which has become a center of activity in what is left of said universe.Green Lantern Corps: Edge Of Oblivion #1 (Jan. 2016) The Corps have returned, damaged and with many casualties, to their proper place and time. Salakk has returned to active duty, such as assisting against the brainwashing menace Starro.

Biography Gian Galeazzo Visconti, with his three sons, presents a model of the Certosa di Pavia to the Virgin (Certosa di Pavia). Visconti was born in Abbiategrasso. Following his father's death, he assumed the title of duke at the age of thirteen, under his mother's regency. The Duchy of Milan soon disintegrated: among the various parties contending its lands, the condottiero Facino Cane prevailed. Taking advantage of Gian Maria's cruelty, he managed to create in him doubts about Caterina, who was imprisoned in Monza, where she died on 17 October 1404, probably murdered. The duke was famous for his dogs, which were trained to slaughter men. In 1408, Gian Maria married Antonia Malatesta of Cesena, daughter of Carlo I, lord of Rimini. They had no issue. A plot by a party of Milanese Ghibellines was raised against the Duke when Facino Cane was ill in Pavia, and Gian Maria was assassinated in front of the church of San Gottardo in Milan. The dying Facino had his officers swear to support Filippo Maria, Gian Maria's brother, who in fact succeeded him.

His music uses a combination of conventional instruments and new, unusual, and structurally modified instruments. Partly due to his studies of non-Western music, much of Denyer's music is microtonal. Biography Denyer was a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral and later studied at the Guildhall in London. In 1966 he co-founded, and was director of, the Society of Hermes, an arts club for new music, painting, poetry and theatre in Shepherds Bush, London. He formed and directed Mouth of Hermes. a professional instrumental ensemble devoted to new and experimental forms of music. He toured widely with the ensemble in Europe, Scandinavia and the U.K. in the years up to 1974, presenting new compositions. During this time he was Lecturer in Composition and 20th Century Studies at Hornsey College of Art. This early period culminated in his being a featured composer/performer at the Festival d‚ÄôOrleans, France, in 1973. Denyer left the UK for a time in 1974 to begin what he calls his \\"musical travels\\", and to undertake his first attempts at ethnomusicological fieldwork (in west Asia and the Kulu Valley in north India). In the summer of 1974 he was a Visiting lecturer at the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad, India. Between 1974 and 1977 he was a PhD student in Ethnomusicology at Wesleyan University in Connecticut. Thereafter he was Research Fellow in African Music at the Institute of African Studies, University of Nairobi, Kenya, and then Lecturer in Ethnomusicology at Kenyatta University College in Nairobi. The impact of these studies on his subsequent musical output is profound, but Denyer has never been interested in hybridization or \\"crossover\\". Upon his return to England in 1981 he began teaching at Dartington College of Arts in Devon, where he was a Professor of Composition until the college merged with University College Falmouth in 2010. Together with James Fulkerson co-founded the Barton Workshop in Amsterdam in 1990 to perform American experimental music and his own compositions; his recordings of the solo piano music and ensemble works of Morton Feldman, Galina Ustvolskaya, Christian Wolff, John Cage, Jerry Hunt, James Tenney, Alvin Lucier and others have met with wide acclaim. Denyer's music has remained resolutely independent of musical fashion. An early interest in melody in the 1970s has remained a feature of his work (as seen perhaps in its most extreme form in his works for shakuhachi, collected on the 2007 CD Music for shakuhachi [see Discography]). His music shows an extraordinary ear for timbre, and for novel combinations of acoustic sounds. The first of his large-scale works, A Monkey's Paw (premiered at Darmstadt in 1990; see Discography) displays this clearly. More recently an interest in extremely quiet sounds has characterised several works, including Prison Song, Faint Traces and Tentative Thoughts, Silenced Voices (collectively forming his Prison Trilogy (1999‚Äì2003)).  Compositions for shakuhachi  Though not a shakuhachi player himself, Denyer has collaborated with Yoshikazu Iwamoto to write pieces for the instrument, including: * After the Rain * Wheat * The Tender Sadness of Tyrants as They Dance * Stalks * Winged Play * Unnamed  Discography  * Silenced Voices.

Felt was an FBI special agent who eventually rose to the position of Associate Director, the Bureau's second-highest-ranking post. Felt worked in several FBI field offices prior to his promotion to the Bureau's headquarters. In 1980 he was convicted of having violated the civil rights of people thought to be associated with members of the Weather Underground, by ordering FBI agents to break into their homes and search the premises as part of an attempt to prevent bombings. He was ordered to pay a fine, but was pardoned by President Ronald Reagan during his appeal. In 2005, at age 91, Felt revealed that during his tenure as associate director of the FBI he had been the notorious anonymous source known as \\"Deep Throat\\" who provided The Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein with critical information about the Watergate scandal, which ultimately led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon in 1974. Though Felt's identity as Deep Throat was suspected, including by Nixon himself, it had generally remained a secret for 30 years. Felt finally acknowledged that he was Deep Throat after being persuaded by his daughter to reveal his identity before his death. Felt published two memoirs: The FBI Pyramid in 1979 (updated in 2006), and A G-Man's Life, written with John O'Connor, in 2006. In 2012 the FBI released Felt's personnel file, covering the period from 1941 to 1978. It also released files pertaining to an extortion threat made against Felt in 1956. Early life and career Born on August 17, 1913, in Twin Falls, Idaho, Felt was the son of Rose R. Dygert and Mark Earl Felt, a carpenter and building contractor. His paternal grandfather was a Free Will Baptist minister. His maternal grandparents were born in Canada and Scotland. Through his maternal grandfather, Felt was descended from Revolutionary War general Nicholas Herkimer of New York. After graduating from Twin Falls High School in 1931, Felt attended the University of Idaho in Moscow. He was a member and president of the Gamma Gamma chapter of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1935. Felt then went to Washington, D.C., to work in the office of Democratic U.S. Senator James P. Pope. In 1938, Felt married Audrey Robinson of Gooding, Idaho, whom he had known when they were students at the University of Idaho. She had come to Washington to work at the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Their wedding was officiated by the chaplain of the United States House of Representatives, the Rev. Sheara Montgomery. Audrey died in 1984; she and Felt had two children, Joan and Mark. Felt stayed on with Pope's successor in the Senate, David Worth Clark (D-Idaho). He attended the George Washington University Law School at night, earning his law degree in 1940, and was admitted to the District of Columbia Bar in 1941. Upon graduation, Felt took a position at the Federal Trade Commission but did not enjoy his work. His workload was very light, and he was assigned to investigate whether a toilet paper brand, called \\"Red Cross\\", was misleading consumers into thinking it was endorsed by the American Red Cross. Felt wrote in his memoir: > My research, which required days of travel and hundreds of interviews, > produced two definite conclusions: 1\\\\. Most people did use toilet tissue. > 2\\\\. Most people did not appreciate being asked about it. That was when I > started looking for other employment. He applied for a job with the FBI in November 1941 and was accepted. His first day at the Bureau was January 26, 1942. Early FBI years FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover often moved Bureau agents around so they would have wide experience in the field. This was typical of other agencies and corporations of the time. Felt observed that Hoover \\"wanted every agent to get into any field office at any time. Since he [Hoover] had never been transferred and did not have a family, he had no idea of the financial and personal hardship involved.\\" After completing 16 weeks of training at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, and FBI Headquarters in Washington, Felt was assigned to Texas, spending three months each in the field offices in Houston and San Antonio. He returned to FBI Headquarters, where he was assigned to the Espionage Section of the Domestic Intelligence Division, tracking down spies and saboteurs during World War II. He worked on the Major Case Desk. His most notable work was on the \\"Peasant\\" case. Helmut Goldschmidt, operating under the codename \\"Peasant\\", was a German agent in custody in England. Under Felt's direction, his German masters were led to believe that \\"Peasant\\" had made his way to the United States, and thus were fed disinformation on Allied plans. The Espionage Section was abolished in May 1945 after V-E Day. After the war, Felt was assigned to the Seattle field office. After two years of general work, he spent two years as a firearms instructor and was promoted from agent to supervisor. Upon passage of the Atomic Energy Act and the creation of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, the Seattle office became responsible for completing background checks of workers at the Hanford plutonium plant near Richland, Washington. Felt oversaw those investigations. In 1954 Felt returned briefly to Washington as an inspector's aide. Two months later, he was sent to New Orleans as Assistant Special Agent-in-Charge of the field office. When he was transferred to Los Angeles fifteen months later, he held the same rank there. Investigates organized crime In 1956, Felt was transferred to Salt Lake City and promoted to Special Agent-in-Charge. The Salt Lake City office included Nevada within its purview, and Felt oversaw some of the Bureau's earliest investigations into organized crime, assessing the mob's operations in the Reno and Las Vegas casinos. (It was Hoover's, and therefore the Bureau's, official position at the time that there was no such thing as the Mob.J. Edgar Hoover: The Man And The Secrets, by Curt Gentry, 1991.) In February 1958, Felt was assigned to Kansas City, Missouri (which he dubbed \\"the Siberia of field offices\\" in his memoir), where he directed further investigations of organized crime. By this time, Hoover had come to believe in organized crime, in the wake of the famous Apalachin, New York, conclave of underworld bosses in November 1957. Middle career J. Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI, photographed in 1961. Hoover appointed Felt the third-ranking official in the Bureau in 1971. Felt returned to Washington, D.C., in September 1962. As assistant to the bureau's assistant director in charge of the Training Division, Felt helped oversee the FBI Academy. In November 1964, he was promoted to an Assistant Director of the Bureau, as Chief Inspector of the Bureau and Head of the Inspection Division. This division oversaw compliance with Bureau regulations and conducted internal investigations. On July 1, 1971, Felt was promoted by Hoover to Deputy Associate Director, assisting Associate Director Clyde Tolson. Hoover's right- hand man for decades, Tolson was in failing health and unable to carry out his duties. Richard Gid Powers wrote that Hoover installed Felt to rein in William C. Sullivan's domestic spying operations, as Sullivan had been engaged in secret unofficial work for the White House. In his memoir, Felt quoted Hoover as having said, \\"I need someone who can control Sullivan. I think you know he has been getting out of hand.\\" In his book, The Bureau, Ronald Kessler said that Felt \\"managed to please Hoover by being tactful with him and tough on agents\\". Curt Gentry described Felt as \\"the director's latest fair-haired boy\\", who had \\"no inherent power\\" in his new post, the real number three being John P. Mohr. =Weather Underground investigations= Among the criminal groups that the FBI investigated in the early 1970s was the Weather Underground. Their case was dismissed by the court because it concluded that the FBI had conducted illegal activities, including unauthorized wiretaps, break-ins, and mail interceptions. The lead federal prosecutor on the case, William C. Ibershof, claims that Felt and Attorney General John Mitchell initiated these illegal activities that tainted the investigation. After Hoover's death L. Patrick Gray, acting director of the FBI from May 1972 to April 1973 Hoover died in his sleep and was found on the morning of May 2, 1972. Tolson was nominally in charge until the next day, when Nixon appointed L. Patrick Gray III as Acting FBI Director. Tolson submitted his resignation, which Gray accepted. Felt succeeded to Tolson's post as Associate Director, the number-two job in the Bureau. Felt served as an honorary pallbearer at Hoover's funeral. On the day of Hoover's death, Hoover's secretary for five decades, Helen Gandy, began destroying his files. She turned over twelve boxes of the \\"Official/Confidential\\" files to Felt on May 4, 1972. These contained 167 files and 17,750 pages, many of them containing derogatory information about individuals whom Hoover had investigated. He used this information as power over them. Felt stored the files in his office. The existence of such files had long been rumored. Gray told the press that afternoon that \\"there are no dossiers or secret files. There are just general files and I took steps to preserve their integrity.\\" Felt earlier that day had told Gray, \\"Mr. Gray, the Bureau doesn't have any secret files\\", and later accompanied Gray to Hoover's office. They found Gandy boxing up papers. Felt said Gray \\"looked casually at an open file drawer and approved her work\\", though Gray would later deny he looked at anything. Gandy retained Hoover's \\"Personal File\\" and destroyed it. When Felt was called to testify in 1975 by the U.S. House about the destruction of Hoover's papers, he said, \\"There's no serious problems if we lose some papers. I don't see anything wrong and I still don't.\\" At the same hearing, Gandy claimed that she had destroyed Hoover's personal files only after receiving Gray's approval. In a letter submitted to the committee in rebuttal of Gandy's testimony, Gray vehemently denied ever giving such permission. Both Gandy's testimony and Gray's letter were included in the committee's final report. In his memoir, Felt expressed mixed feelings about Gray. He was the first person appointed as head of the FBI who had no experience in the agency, but he had experience in the Navy. While noting Gray did work hard, Felt was critical of how often he was away from FBI headquarters. Gray lived in Stonington, Connecticut, and commuted to Washington. He also visited all of the Bureau's field offices except Honolulu. His frequent absences led to the nickname \\"Three-Day Gray\\". These absences, combined with Gray's hospitalization and recuperation from November 20, 1972, to January 2, 1973, meant that Felt was effectively in charge for much of his final year at the Bureau. Bob Woodward wrote \\"Gray got to be director of the FBI and Felt did the work.\\" Felt wrote in his memoir: > The record amply demonstrates that President Nixon made Pat Gray the Acting > Director of the FBI because he wanted a politician in J. Edgar Hoover's > position who would convert the Bureau into an adjunct of the White House > machine. Gray's defenders would later argue that Gray had practiced a management style that was different from that of Hoover. Gray's program of field office visits was something that Hoover had not done since his early years as director; some believed that Gray's visits helped raise the morale of the field agents. Gray's leadership style seemed to continue what he had learned in the US Navy, in which the executive officer concentrates on the basic operation of the ship, while the captain concentrates on its position and heading. Felt believed Gray's methods were an unnecessary distraction from the work of the FBI and showed a lack of leadership. He believed that he was not the only career manager at the FBI who disapproved of Gray's methods, particularly among those who had served under Hoover. Watergate As Associate Director, Felt saw everything compiled on Watergate before it was given to Gray. The Agent in Charge, Charles Nuzum, sent his findings to Investigative Division Head Robert Gebhardt, who passed the information on to Felt. From the day of the break-in, June 17, 1972, until the FBI investigation was mostly completed in June 1973, Felt was the key control point for FBI information. He had been among the first to learn of the investigation, being informed the morning of June 17. Ronald Kessler, who spoke to former Bureau agents, reported that throughout the investigation, they \\"were amazed to see material in Woodward and Bernstein's stories lifted almost verbatim from their reports of interviews a few days or weeks earlier\\". = \\"Deep Throat\\" informant = Bob Woodward first describes his source, nicknamed \\"Deep Throat\\", in All the President's Men, as a \\"source in the Executive Branch who had access to information at CRP (the Committee to Re-elect the President, Nixon's 1972 campaign organization), as well as at the White House\\". In the book, Deep Throat is described as an \\"incorrigible gossip\\" who was \\"in a unique position to observe the Executive Branch\\", a man \\"whose fight had been worn out in too many battles\\". Woodward had known the source before Watergate and had discussed politics and government with him. In 2005 Woodward wrote that he first met Felt at the White House in 1969 or 1970. Woodward was working as an aide to Admiral Thomas Hinman Moorer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and was delivering papers to the White House Situation Room. In his book The Secret Man, Woodward described Felt as a \\"tall man with perfectly combed gray hair ... distinguished looking\\" with a \\"studied air of confidence, even what might be called a command presence\\". They stayed in touch and spoke on the telephone several times. When Woodward started working at the Washington Post, he phoned Felt on several occasions to ask for information for articles in the paper. Felt's information, taken on a promise that Woodward would never reveal its origin, was a source for a few stories, notably for an article on May 18, 1972, about Arthur Bremer, who shot George Wallace. When the Watergate story broke, Woodward called on Felt. Felt told Woodward on June 19 that E. Howard Hunt, who had ties to Nixon, was involved: the telephone number of his White House office had been listed in the address book of one of the burglars. Initially, Woodward's source was known at the Post as \\"My Friend\\". Post editor Howard Simons tagged him as \\"Deep Throat\\", after the widely known pornographic film Deep Throat. According to Woodward, Simons thought of the term because Felt had been providing information on a deep background basis. When Felt revealed his role in 2005, it was noted that \\"My Friend\\" has the same initial letters as \\"Mark Felt\\". Woodward's notes from interviewing Felt were marked \\"M.F.\\", which Woodward says was \\"not very good tradecraft\\". =Code for contacting Woodward= Felt saw all files on the FBI's investigation of the break-in at the Watergate complex in 1972 Woodward explained that when he wanted to meet Deep Throat, he would move a flowerpot with a red flag on his apartment balcony; he lived at number 617, Webster House, 1718 P Street, Northwest. On occasions when Deep Throat wanted a meeting, he would circle the page number on page twenty of Woodward's copy of The New York Times (delivered to his building) and draw clock hands to signal the hour. Adrian Havill questioned these claims in his 1993 biography of Woodward and Bernstein. He said Woodward's balcony faced an interior courtyard and was not visible from the street. Woodward said that the courtyard had been bricked in since he lived there. Havill also said The Times was not delivered in copies marked by apartment, but Woodward and a former neighbor disputed this claim. Woodward said: =Haldeman informs Nixon about Felt's leaks= Felt's leaks to Woodward spurred investigations that led to Nixon's resignation Days after the break- in, Nixon and White House chief of staff H. R. Haldeman talked about putting pressure on the FBI to slow down the investigation. The District of Columbia police had called in the FBI because they found the burglars had wiretapping equipment. Wiretapping is a crime investigated by the FBI. Haldeman told President Nixon on June 23, 1972, that Felt would \\"want to cooperate because he's ambitious\\". These tapes were not declassified and revealed for some time. Haldeman later initially suspected lower-level FBI agents, including Angelo Lano, of speaking to the Post. But in a taped conversation on October 19, 1972, Haldeman told the president that sources had said that Felt was speaking to the press. > You can't say anything about this because it will screw up our source and > there's a real concern. Mitchell is the only one who knows about this and he > feels strongly that we better not do anything because ... if we move on him, > he'll go out and unload everything. He knows everything that's to be known > in the FBI. He has access to absolutely everything. Haldeman also said that he had spoken to White House counsel John W. Dean about punishing Felt, but Dean said Felt had committed no crime and could not be prosecuted. When Acting FBI Director Gray returned from his sick leave in January 1973, he confronted Felt about being the source for Woodward and Bernstein. Gray said he had defended Felt to Attorney General Richard G. Kleindienst: \\"You know, Mark, Dick Kleindienst told me I ought to get rid of you. He says White House staff members are concerned that you are the FBI source of leaks to Woodward and Bernstein\\". Felt replied, \\"Pat, I haven't leaked anything to anybody.\\" Gray told Felt: > I told Kleindienst that you've worked with me in a very competent manner and > I'm convinced that you are completely loyal. I told him I was not going to > move you out. Kleindienst told me, \\"Pat, I love you for that.\\" =Nixon passes over Felt again= On February 17, 1973, Nixon nominated Gray as Hoover's permanent replacement as Director. Until then, Gray had been in limbo as Acting Director. In another taped conversation on February 28, Nixon spoke to Dean about Felt's acting as an informant, and mentioned that he had never met him. Gray was forced to resign on April 27, after it was revealed that he had destroyed a file that had been in the White House safe of E. Howard Hunt. Gray recommended Felt as his successor. The day Gray resigned, Kleindienst spoke to Nixon, urging him to appoint Felt as head of the FBI. Nixon instead appointed William Ruckelshaus as Acting Director. Stanley Kutler reported that Nixon said, \\"I don't want him. I can't have him. I just talked to Bill Ruckelshaus and Bill is a Mr. Clean and I want a fellow in there that is not part of the old guard and that is not part of that infighting in there.\\" On another White House tape, from May 11, 1973, Nixon and White House Chief of Staff, Alexander Haig, spoke of Felt leaking material to The New York Times. Nixon said, \\"he's a bad guy, you see.\\" He said that William Sullivan had told him of Felt's ambition to be Director of the Bureau. Clashes with Ruckelshaus and resignation Felt called his relationship with Ruckelshaus \\"stormy\\". In his memoir, Felt describes Ruckelshaus as a \\"security guard sent to see that the FBI did nothing which would displease Mr. Nixon\\". In mid-1973 The New York Times published a series of articles about wiretaps that had been ordered by Hoover during his tenure at the FBI. Ruckelshaus believed that the information must have come from someone at the FBI. In June 1973 Ruckelshaus received a call from someone claiming to be a New York Times reporter, telling him that Felt was the source of this information. On June 21, Ruckelshaus met privately with Felt and accused him of leaking information to The New York Times, a charge that Felt adamantly denied. Ruckelshaus told Felt to \\"sleep on it\\" and let him know the next day what he wanted to do. Felt resigned from the Bureau the next day, June 22, 1973, ending his thirty-one year career. In a 2013 interview, Ruckelshaus noted the possibility that the original caller was a hoax. He said that he considered Felt's resignation \\"an admission of guilt\\" anyway. Ruckelshaus, who had served only as Acting Director, was replaced several weeks later by Clarence M. Kelley, who had been nominated by Nixon as FBI Director and confirmed by the Senate. Trial and conviction In the early 1970s Felt had supervised Operation COINTELPRO, initiated by Hoover in the 1950s. This period of FBI history has generated great controversy for its abuses of private citizens' rights. The FBI was spying on, infiltrating, and disrupting the Civil Rights Movement, Anti-War Movement, Black Panthers, and other New Left groups. By 1972 Felt was heading the investigation into the Weather Underground, which had planted bombs at the Capitol, the Pentagon, and the State Department building. Felt, along with Edward S. Miller, ordered FBI agents to break into homes secretly in 1972 and 1973, without a search warrant, on nine separate occasions. These kinds of FBI operations were known as \\"black bag jobs\\". The break-ins occurred at five addresses in New York and New Jersey, at the homes of relatives and acquaintances of Weather Underground members. They did not contribute to the capture of any fugitives. The use of \\"black bag jobs\\" by the FBI was declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in the Plamondon case, 407 U.S. 297 (1972). The Church Committee of Congress revealed the FBI's illegal activities, and many agents were investigated. In 1976 Felt publicly stated he had ordered break-ins, and recommended against punishment of individual agents who had carried out orders. Felt also stated that Patrick Gray had also authorized the break-ins, but Gray denied this. Felt said on the CBS television program Face the Nation he would probably be a \\"scapegoat\\" for the Bureau's work. \\"I think this is justified and I'd do it again tomorrow,\\" he said on the program. While admitting the break-ins were \\"extralegal\\", he justified them as protecting the \\"greater good\\". Felt said: > To not take action against these people and know of a bombing in advance > would simply be to stick your fingers in your ears and protect your eardrums > when the explosion went off and then start the investigation. Griffin B. Bell, the Attorney General in the Jimmy Carter administration, directed investigation of these cases. On April 10, 1978, a federal grand jury charged Felt, Miller, and Gray with conspiracy to violate the constitutional rights of American citizens by searching their homes without warrants. The indictment charged violations of Title 18, Section 241 of the United States Code and stated Felt and the others: > Did unlawfully, willfully, and knowingly combine, conspire, confederate, and > agree together and with each other to injure and oppress citizens of the > United States who were relatives and acquaintances of the Weatherman > fugitives, in the free exercise and enjoyments of certain rights and > privileges secured to them by the Constitution and the laws of the United > States of America. Felt told his biographer Ronald Kessler: I was shocked that I was indicted. You would be too, if you did what you thought was in the best interests of the country and someone on technical grounds indicted you. Felt, Gray, and Miller were arraigned in Washington, DC on April 20. Seven hundred current and former FBI agents were outside the courthouse applauding the \\"Washington Three\\", as Felt referred to himself and his colleagues in his memoir. Gray's case did not go to trial and was dropped by the government for lack of evidence on December 11, 1980. Felt and Miller attempted to plea bargain with the government, willing to agree to a misdemeanor guilty plea to conducting searches without warrants‚Äîa violation of . The government rejected the offer in 1979. After eight postponements, the case against Felt and Miller went to trial in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on September 18, 1980. On October 29, former President Richard M. Nixon appeared as a rebuttal witness for the defense. He testified that in authorizing the Bureau to conduct break-ins to gather foreign intelligence information \\"he was acting on precedents established by a number of Presidential directives dating to 1939.\\" It was Nixon's first courtroom appearance since his resignation in 1974. Nixon also contributed money to Felt's defense fund, since Felt's legal expenses were running over $600,000 by then. Also testifying were former Attorneys General Mitchell, Kleindienst, Herbert Brownell Jr., Nicholas Katzenbach, and Ramsey Clark, all of whom said warrantless searches in national security matters were commonplace and understood not to be illegal. Mitchell and Kleindienst denied they had authorized any of the break-ins at issue in the trial. (The Bureau used a national security justification for the searches because it alleged the Weather Underground was in the employ of Cuba.) The jury returned guilty verdicts on November 6, 1980, two days after the presidential election. The charge carried a maximum sentence of ten years in prison and a $10,000 fine; on December 15, Judge William Bryant fined Felt $5,000 and Miller $3,500, but imposed no jail time for either. Writing an OpEd piece in The New York Times a week after the conviction, attorney Roy Cohn claimed that Felt and Miller were being used as scapegoats by the Carter administration and it was an unfair prosecution. Cohn wrote the break-ins were the \\"final dirty trick\\" of the Nixon administration, and there had been no \\"personal motive\\" to their actions. The New York Times praised the convictions, saying \\"the case has established that zeal is no excuse for violating the Constitution.\\" Felt and Miller appealed their verdicts. Pardon President Ronald Reagan pardoned Felt and Miller.In a phone call on January 30, 1981, Edwin Meese encouraged President Ronald Reagan to issue a pardon. After further encouragement from Felt's former colleagues, President Reagan pardoned Felt and Miller. The pardon was signed on March 26, but due to the assassination attempt on March 30, was not announced to the public until April 15, 1981. In the pardon, Reagan wrote: Nixon sent Felt and Miller bottles of champagne with the note \\"Justice ultimately prevails.\\" The New York Times disapproved in an editorial, saying that the United States \\"deserved better than a gratuitous revision of the record by the President\\". Felt and Miller said they would seek repayment of their legal fees from the government. The prosecutor at the trial, John W. Nields Jr., said, \\"I would warrant that whoever is responsible for the pardons did not read the record of the trial and did not know the facts of the case.\\" Nields also complained that the White House did not consult with the prosecutors in the case, which was contrary to the usual practice when a pardon was under consideration. Felt said, > I feel very excited and just so pleased that I can hardly contain myself. I > am most grateful to the President. I don't know how I'm ever going to be > able to thank him. It's just like having a heavy burden lifted off your > back. This case has been dragging on for five years. At a press conference the day of the announcement, Miller said, \\"I certainly owe the Gipper one.\\" Carter Attorney General Griffin Bell said he did not object to the pardons, as the convictions had upheld constitutional principles. Despite their pardons, Felt and Miller won permission from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to appeal their convictions so as to remove it from their record and to prevent it from being used in civil suits by victims of the break-ins they had ordered. Ultimately, the court restored Felt's law license in 1982, based on Reagan's pardon. In June 1982, Felt and Miller testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee's security and terrorism subcommittee. They said that the restrictions placed on the FBI by Attorney General Edward H. Levi were threatening the country's safety. Family life His daughter Joan graduated from high school in Kansas City during his assignment there and attended the University of Kansas for two years before transferring to Stanford in California to study drama. When she was an undergraduate, Felt finally settled in Alexandria, Virginia, when he took his post at the FBI Academy. Prior to the Watergate scandal, Felt had become estranged from Joan. They had been close during her childhood, but after she graduated from Stanford, she had gone to Chile under a Fulbright scholarship to continue her studies. While there, she became friends with Marxist revolutionary Andr√©s Pascal Allende, nephew of future president Salvador Allende. When she returned home, her political views had shifted to the extreme left, putting her in conflict with her conservative father. She earned her master's degree in Spanish at Stanford, and then joined a hippie community in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Felt and his wife went to visit her once and were appalled at her counterculture lifestyle and use of drugs; he was reminded of members of the militant Weather Underground that the FBI had been prosecuting. Joan's friends were equally shocked that her father was an FBI agent. Following their visit, Joan cut off most contact with her parents. As a result, and combined with the fact that she did not follow the news, she was unaware of her father's legal problems that arose from the Watergate scandal. Over the years, the stress of following her husband's career as well as from the separation from her daughter, combined with Felt's prosecution had taken their toll on Audrey. During Felt's time in Seattle in 1954, Audrey suffered a nervous breakdown. She developed a dependency on alcohol and had been taking antidepressants for years. She had also been hospitalized several times for various ailments. When Felt was put on trial in 1980, she attended the first day, but did not return because she was unable to bear it. In 1984 she committed suicide using Felt's revolver. Felt and his son Mark Jr., an officer in the United States Air Force, decided to keep this a secret and told Joan that her mother had died of a heart attack. Joan did not learn the truth about her mother until 2001. Meanwhile, Joan had become an adherent of Adi Da, who had founded a new religious movement in San Francisco called Adidam, and she was living in Santa Rosa. She had borne three sonsLudi (later Will), Rob, and Nick, the latter two from another Adidam devotee whom she never marriedbut her parents had only met Ludi during their visit in 1974. After Audrey's death, Felt began making yearly visits to see Joan and his grandsons, and they also came to visit him and his new girlfriend, who lived in the same apartment complex. In 1990 Felt permanently moved to Santa Rosa, leaving behind his entire life in Alexandria. He bought a house where he lived with Joan, and took care of the boys while she worked, teaching at Sonoma State University and Santa Rosa Junior College. He suffered a stroke before 1999, as reported by Kessler in his book The Bureau. According to Kessler's book, in the summer of 1999, Woodward showed up unexpectedly at the Santa Rosa home and took Felt to lunch. Joan, who was caring for her father, told Kessler that her father had greeted Woodward like an old friend. Their meeting appeared to be more of a celebration than an interview. \\"Woodward just showed up at the door and said he was in the area,\\" Joan Felt was quoted as saying in Kessler's book, which was published in 2002. \\"He came in a white limousine, which parked at a schoolyard about ten blocks away. He walked to the house. He asked if it was okay to have a martini with my father at lunch, and I said it would be fine.\\" Memoir Felt published his memoir The FBI Pyramid: From the Inside in 1979. It was co-written with Hoover biographer Ralph de Toledano, though the latter's name appears only in the copyright notice. Toledano in 2005 wrote that the volume was \\"largely written by me since his original manuscript read like The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table\\". Toledano said: Felt swore to me that he was not Deep Throat, and that he had never leaked information to the Woodward-Bernstein team or anyone else. The book was published and bombed. In his memoir, Felt strongly defended Hoover and his tenure as Director; he condemned the criticisms of the Bureau made in the 1970s by the Church Committee and civil libertarians. He also denounced the treatment of Bureau agents as criminals and said the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act of 1974 served only to interfere with government work and helped criminals. (He opens the book with the sentence, \\"The Bill of Rights is not a suicide pact\\", Justice Robert H. Jackson's comment in his dissent to Terminiello v. City of Chicago, 337 U.S. 1 (1949)). Library Journal wrote in its review that \\"at one time Felt was assumed to be Watergate's 'Deep Throat'; in this interesting but hardly sensational memoir, he makes it clear that that honor, if honor it be, lies elsewhere.\\" The New York Times Book Review was highly critical of the book, saying Felt \\"seeks to perpetuate a view of Hoover and the FBI that is no longer seriously peddled even on the backs of cereal boxes\\". It said the book contained \\"a disturbing number of factual errors\\". Curt Gentry said that Felt was \\"the keeper of the Hoover flame\\". Kessler said in his book that the measures Woodward took to conceal his meeting with Felt lent \\"credence\\" to the notion that Felt was Deep Throat. Woodward confirmed that Felt was Deep Throat in 2005. \\"There are plenty of people claiming they knew Deep Throat was actually former FBI man Mark Felt ... On May 3, 2002, PAGE SIX reported that Ronald Kessler, author of The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI, says that all the evidence points to former top FBI official W. Mark Felt.\\"New York Post, June 3, 2005 Deep Throat speculation The identity of Deep Throat was debated for more than three decades, and Felt was frequently mentioned as a possibility. An October 1990 Washingtonian magazine article about \\"Washington secrets\\" listed the 15 most prominent Deep Throat candidates, including Felt. Jack Limpert published evidence as early as 1974 that Felt was the informant. On June 25 of that year, a few weeks after All the President's Men was published, The Wall Street Journal ran an editorial, \\"If You Drink Scotch, Smoke, Read, Maybe You're Deep Throat.\\" It began \\"W. Mark Felt says he isn't now, nor has he ever been Deep Throat.\\" The Journal quoted Felt saying the character was a \\"composite\\" and \\"I'm just not that kind of person.\\" In 1975 George V. Higgins wrote: \\"Mark Felt knows more reporters than most reporters do, and there are some who think he had a Washington Post alias borrowed from a dirty movie.\\"George V. Higgins (1975), The Friends of Richard Nixon, 1976 reprint, New York: Ballantine, Ch. 14, p. 147, . During a grand jury investigation in 1976, Felt was called to testify. The prosecutor, J. Stanley Pottinger, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, discovered that Felt was \\"Deep Throat\\", but the secrecy of the proceedings protected the information from being public. In 1992 James Mann, who had been a reporter at The Washington Post in 1972 and worked with Woodward, wrote a piece for The Atlantic Monthly, saying the source had to have been within the FBI. He noted Felt as a possibility, but said he could not confirm this. Alexander P. Butterfield, the White House aide best known for revealing Nixon's taping system, told the Hartford Courant in 1995, \\"I think it was a guy named Mark Felt.\\" In July 1999, Felt was identified as Deep Throat by the Hartford Courant, citing Chase Culeman-Beckman, a nineteen-year-old from Port Chester, New York. Culeman-Beckman said Jacob Bernstein, the son of Carl Bernstein and Nora Ephron, had told him the name at summer camp in 1988, and that Jacob claimed he had been told by his father. Felt said to the Courant, \\"No, it's not me. I would have done better. I would have been more effective. Deep Throat didn't exactly bring the White House crashing down, did he?\\" Bernstein said his son didn't know. \\"Bob and I have been wise enough never to tell our wives, and we've certainly never told our children.\\" (Bernstein reiterated on June 2, 2005, on the Today Show that his wife had never known.) Leonard Garment, President Nixon's former law partner who became White House counsel after John W. Dean's resignation, ruled Felt out as Deep Throat in his 2000 book In Search of Deep Throat. Garment wrote: > The Felt theory was a strong one ... Felt had a personal motive for acting. > After the death of J. Edgar Hoover ... Felt thought he was a leading > candidate to succeed Hoover ... The characteristics were a good fit. The > trouble with Felt's candidacy was that Deep Throat in All the President's > Men simply did not sound to me like a career FBI man. Garment said the information leaked to Woodward was inside White House information to which Felt would not have had access. \\"Felt did not fit.\\" (Once the secret was revealed, it was noted Felt did have access to such information because the Bureau's agents were interviewing high-ranking White House officials.) In 2002 the San Francisco Chronicle profiled Felt. Noting his denial in The FBI Pyramid, the paper wrote: > Curiously, his son‚ÄîAmerican Airlines pilot Mark Felt‚Äînow says that shouldn't > be read as a definitive denial, and that he plans to answer the question > once-and-for-all in a second memoir. The excerpt of the working draft > obtained by the Chronicle has Felt still denying he's Throat but providing a > rationale for why Throat did the right thing. In February 2005 reports surfaced that Woodward had prepared Deep Throat's obituary because he was near death. Chief Justice William Rehnquist was battling cancer at the time (he would die in September 2005), and there was speculation that Rehnquist might have been Deep Throat. Rehnquist was Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel, from 1969 to 1971, and then served on the Supreme Court until his death in 2005. Deep Throat revealed Vanity Fair magazine revealed that Felt was Deep Throat on May 31, 2005, when it published an article (eventually appearing in the July issue of the magazine) on its website by John D. O'Connor, an attorney acting on Felt's behalf. Felt said, \\"I'm the guy they used to call Deep Throat.\\" After the Vanity Fair story broke, Benjamin C. Bradlee, the editor of the Washington Post during Watergate, confirmed that Felt was Deep Throat. According to the Vanity Fair article, Felt was persuaded to come out by his family. They hoped to capitalize on the book deals and other lucrative opportunities which Felt would be offered in order to help pay for his grandchildren's education. His family was unaware that he was Deep Throat for many years. Although Felt was suffering from dementia and had previously denied he was Deep Throat, both Woodward and Bernstein confirmed the attorney's claim. Felt's family realized the truth after his retirement, when they became aware of his close friendship with Bob Woodward. Nixon's Chief Counsel Charles Colson, who served prison time for his actions in the Nixon White House, said Felt had violated \\"his oath to keep this nation's secrets\\". A Los Angeles Times editorial argued that this argument was specious, \\"as if there's no difference between nuclear strategy and rounding up hush money to silence your hired burglars\\". Ralph de Toledano, who co-wrote Felt's 1979 memoir, said Mark Felt Jr. had approached him in 2004 to buy Toledano's half of the copyright. Toledano agreed to sell but was never paid. He attempted to rescind the deal, threatening legal action. A few days before the Vanity Fair article was released, Toledano finally received a check. He later said: \\"I had been gloriously and illegally deceived, and Deep Throat was, in characteristic style, back in business‚Äîwhich given his history of betrayal, was par for the course.\\" After the revelation, publishers were interested in signing Felt to a book deal. Weeks later, PublicAffairs Books announced that it signed a deal with Felt. Its CEO was a Washington Post reporter and editor during the Watergate era. The new book was to include material from Felt's 1979 memoir, plus an update. The new volume was scheduled for publication in early 2006. Felt sold the movie rights to his story to Universal Pictures for development by Tom Hanks's production company, Playtone. The book and movie deals were valued at US$1 million. A film based on those rights, Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House, in which Felt is portrayed by Liam Neeson, was released in 2017. In mid-2005 Woodward published an account of his contacts with Felt, The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat (). Appraisal of Watergate role Public response to Felt and his actions has varied widely since these revelations. In the immediate aftermath, Felt's family called him an \\"American hero\\", suggesting that he leaked information for moral or patriotic reasons. G. Gordon Liddy, who was convicted of burglary in the Watergate scandal, said Felt should have gone to the grand jury rather than leak. Speculation about Felt's motives for leaking has also varied widely. Some suggested that it was revenge for Nixon's choosing Gray over Felt to replace Hoover as FBI Director. Others suggest Felt acted out of institutional loyalty to the FBI. Political scientist George Friedman argued: > The Washington Post created a morality play about an out-of-control > government brought to heel by two young, enterprising journalists and a > courageous newspaper. That simply wasn't what happened. Instead, it was > about the FBI using The Washington Post to leak information to destroy the > president, and The Washington Post willingly serving as the conduit for that > information while withholding an essential dimension of the story by > concealing Deep Throat's identity. In his 2012 book Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat, Max Holland argued that Felt leaked the information in an attempt to become head of the FBI. Holland said that Felt wanted to create the perception that Gray \\"could not control the FBI\\". This could result in Nixon's firing Gray, leaving Felt as the obvious choice to run the agency. Holland said this plan (if it was one) backfired as Nixon and his team found out that Felt was the leaker. Death Felt died at home, in his sleep, on December 18, 2008. He was 95 years old and his death was attributed to heart failure.

He was a patriot leader during the American Revolution and represented New York in the Continental Congress. Wisner was born around 1720 in Florida, New York and was a resident of Orange County. He built and operated a gristmill in Goshen and became one of the town's leading citizens. His family originally came to America because his grandfather Johannes Weasner migrated to New York in 1710 along with other Swiss veterans of the English Army who fought under Marlborough in the War of the Spanish Succession.George Franklin Wisner: \\"The Wisners and Their Kindred in America\\" 1918 Orange County first elected him as a representative to Province of New York Assembly in 1759 and returned him for eleven consecutive years. In 1768 he became a judge in the county's court of common pleas. When New York created a revolutionary government in 1775, Wisner was sent to the New York Provincial Congress. That body, in turn, named him as a delegate to the Continental Congress where he served through 1776. Wisner was in Congress when the Declaration of Independence adopted, but the New York delegation was not authorized to declare independence, and so Wisner could not take part in the voting. The claim made years later that Wisner was the only member of the New York delegation to vote in favor of independence seems to be without foundation; he did not vote because he could not vote.Robert Ernst. \\"Wisner, Henry\\"; American National Biography Online, February 2000. After the New York delegation was finally authorized to support the Declaration, a signing ceremony took place in August 1776, but Wisner was not present in Congress to sign. While in Congress, Wisner learned that one of the Continental Army's difficulties was obtaining powder and shot. When he returned home he built three gunpowder mills in Orange and Ulster Counties. At their height he was shipping 1,000 pounds of gunpowder each week to Washington's army. He later financed the erection of cannon and defensive works overlooking the Hudson River, that blocked the British ability to use the river in the Highlands Region. In late 1776 Wisner, along with Gilbert Livingston of Poughkeepsie, sounded the Hudson River and, as part of a Secret Committee, recommended the placement of what became known as the Great Chain which stretched from the current location of West Point to Constitution Island. This chain was part of a series of Hudson River Chains designed to thwart British naval movements on the HudsonLetter from Henry Wisner and Gilbert Livingston to New-York Committee of Safety: Soundings of Hudson river in the Highlands American Archives Series 5, Volume 3, Page 0812 November 22, 1776. http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi- bin/amarch/getdoc.pl?/var/lib/philologic/databases/amarch/.27283 Accessed November 28, 2014. In 1777, serving again in the provincial congress, Wisner was a member of the committee that drafted the first constitution for the state of New York. Under that constitution, Wisner was a member of the state senate from 1777 until 1782. After the war he remained active in civic affairs. In 1784, he founded an Academy in Goshen, and was one of the regents of the University of the State of New York from 1784 to 1787. In 1788, Wisner was a delegate to the state convention called to ratify the U.S. Constitution. He was one of those who opposed ratification, fearing that the strong central government would eventually infringe on state and individual rights. Wisner died at home in Goshen in 1790. He was buried in the Old Wallkill Cemetery in Wallkill, New York.Biographical Directory of the United States Congress Family and descendants Wisner married Sarah Norton in 1739. His son Gabriel, born 1754, died in 1779 in the Battle of Minisink. He married Elizabeth Waters and had three children. His daughter, Sarah Wisner (1745‚Äì1810), married Major Moses Phillips (a descendant of the Rev, George Phillips, the Winthrop family through Elizabeth Fones, and Thomas Cornell (settler)), with whom he made gunpowder for George Washington. Moses Wisner, a collateral descendant, was the 12th Governor of Michigan. Charles F. Brush, inventor and commercializer of the arc lamp and founder of a predecessor firm of General Electric, is a great great-grandson.

These views are artifacts for visualizing, understanding, and assimilating the broad scope and complexities of an architecture description through tabular, structural, behavioral, ontological, pictorial, temporal, graphical, probabilistic, or alternative conceptual means. The current release is DoDAF 2.02. This Architecture Framework is especially suited to large systems with complex integration and interoperability challenges, and it is apparently unique in its employment of \\"operational views\\". These views offer overview and details aimed to specific stakeholders within their domain and in interaction with other domains in which the system will operate.(reference: Zachman Framework) Overview The DoDAF provides a foundational framework for developing and representing architecture descriptions that ensure a common denominator for understanding, comparing, and integrating architectures across organizational, joint, and multinational boundaries. It establishes data element definitions, rules, and relationships and a baseline set of products for consistent development of systems, integrated, or federated architectures. These architecture descriptions may include families of systems (FoS), systems of systems (SoS), and net-centric capabilities for interoperating and interacting in the non-combat environment. DoD Components are expected to conform to DoDAF to the maximum extent possible in development of architectures within the Department. Conformance ensures that reuse of information, architecture artifacts, models, and viewpoints can be shared with common understanding. All major U.S. DoD weapons and information technology system acquisitions are required to develop and document an enterprise architecture (EA) using the views prescribed in the DoDAF. While it is clearly aimed at military systems, DoDAF has broad applicability across the private, public and voluntary sectors around the world, and represents one of a large number of systems architecture frameworks. mandatory appendices for ICD, CDD, and CPD, e.g. pg E-A-5 \\"Mandatory: OV-1\\" *The purpose of DoDAF is to define concepts and models usable in DoD's six core processes: *#Joint Capabilities Integration and Development (JCIDS) *#Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) *#Defense Acquisition System (DAS) *#Systems Engineering (SE) *#Operational Planning (OPLAN) *#Capability Portfolio Management (CPM) *In addition, DoDAF 2.0's specific goals were to: *#Establish guidance for architecture content as a function of purpose ‚Äì ‚Äúfit for purpose‚Äù *#Increase utility and effectiveness of architectures via a rigorous data model ‚Äì the DoDAF Meta Model (DM2)  so the architectures can be integrated, analyzed, and evaluated with more precision. History Evolution of the DoDAF since the 1990s. The DoDAF V2.0 was released in May, 2009. The first version of the development DoDAF was developed in the 1990s under the name C4ISR Architecture Framework. In the same period the reference model TAFIM, which was initiated in 1986, was further developed. The first C4ISR Architecture Framework v1.0, released 7 June 1996, was created in response to the passage of the Clinger- Cohen Act. It addressed the 1995 Deputy Secretary of Defense directive that a DoD-wide effort be undertaken to define and develop a better means and process for ensuring that C4ISR capabilities were interoperable and met the needs of the warfighter. Continued development effort resulted in December 1997 in the second version, C4ISR Architecture Framework v2.0. In August 2003 the DoDAF v1.0 was released, which restructured the C4ISR Framework v2.0 to offer guidance, product descriptions, and supplementary information in two volumes and a Desk Book. It broadened the applicability of architecture tenets and practices to all Mission Areas rather than just the C4ISR community. This document addressed usage, integrated architectures, DoD and Federal policies, value of architectures, architecture measures, DoD decision support processes, development techniques, analytical techniques, and the CADM v1.01, and moved towards a repository-based approach by placing emphasis on architecture data elements that comprise architecture products. In February 2004 the documentation of Version 1.0 was released with volume \\"I: Definitions and Guidelines\\", \\"II: Product Descriptions\\" and a \\"Deskbook\\". In April 2007 the Version 1.5 was released with a documentation of \\"Definitions and Guidelines\\", \\"Product Descriptions\\" and \\"Architecture Data Description\\". On May 28, 2009 DoDAF v2.0 was approved by the Department of Defense.DoD CIO Memo Releasing DoDAF 2.0 The current version is DoDAF 2.02 DoDAF V2.0 is published on a public website.DoD CIO DoDAF Website Other derivative frameworks based on DoDAF include the NATO Architecture Framework (NAF) and Ministry of Defence Architecture Framework. Like other EA approaches, for example The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF), DoDAF is organized around a shared repository to hold work products. The repository is defined by the common database schema Core Architecture Data Model 2.0 and the DoD Architecture Registry System (DARS). A key feature of DoDAF is interoperability, which is organized as a series of levels, called Levels of Information System Interoperability (LISI). The developing system must not only meet its internal data needs but also those of the operational framework into which it is set. Capabilities and mission See the diagram for a depiction of the Capabilities Emphasis, as tied in with mission/course of action, threads, activities, and architectures. Capabilities Described with Architectures The DoD has moved toward a focus on the delivery of capabilities, which are the reason for creating the system/service. The Capability Models describe capability taxonomy and capability evolution. A capability thread would equate to the specific activities, rules, and systems that are linked to that particular capability. The concept of capability, as defined by its Meta-model Data Group allows one to answer questions such as: * How does a particular capability or capabilities support the overall mission/vision? * What outcomes are expected to be achieved by a particular capability or set of capabilities? * What services are required to support a capability? * What is the functional scope and organizational span of a capability or set of capabilities? * What is our current set of capabilities that we are managing as part of a portfolio? The Mission or Course of Action is described by a Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and is organized by Capabilities. * Capabilities are described by Threads. * Threads are described by Activities executed in serial or parallel. * Activities are grouped into Mission Areas. Activities define operations for an Architecture. * Architectures are organized by mission areas. Architectures provide proper resourcing of capabilities required by the Mission or Course of Action. Version 1.5 views DoDAF V1.5 Linkages Among Views. DoD C4ISR Framework The DoDAF V1.5 defines a set of products, a view model, that act as mechanisms for visualizing, understanding, and assimilating the broad scope and complexities of an architecture description through graphic, tabular, or textual means. These products are organized under four views: * All view (AV) * Operational view (OV) * Systems view (SV) * Technical standards view (TV) Each view depicts certain perspectives of an architecture as described below. Only a subset of the full DoDAF viewset is usually created for each system development. The figure represents the information that links the operational view, systems and services view, and technical standards view. The three views and their interrelationships ‚Äì driven by common architecture data elements ‚Äì provide the basis for deriving measures such as interoperability or performance, and for measuring the impact of the values of these metrics on operational mission and task effectiveness. =All view= All view (AV) products provide overarching descriptions of the entire architecture and define the scope and context of the architecture. The DoDAF V1.5 AV products are defined as: ; AV-1 Overview and Summary Information : Scope, purpose, intended users, environment depicted, analytical findings (if applicable) ; AV-2 Integrated Dictionary : Definitions of all terms used in all products. =Operational view= Operational View (OV) products provide descriptions of the tasks and activities, operational elements, and information exchanges required to accomplish DoD missions. The OV provides textual and graphical representations of operational nodes and elements, assigned tasks and activities, and information flows between nodes. It defines the type of information exchanged, the frequency of exchanges, the tasks and activities supported by these exchanges and the nature of the exchanges. The DoDAF V1.5 OV products are defined as: ; OV-1 High Level Operational Concept Graphic : High level graphical and textual description of operational concept (high level organizations, missions, geographic configuration, connectivity, etc.). ; OV-2 Operational Node Connectivity Description : Operational nodes, activities performed at each node, and connectivities and information flow between nodes. ; OV-3 Operational Information Exchange Matrix : Information exchanged between nodes and the relevant attributes of that exchange such as media, quality, quantity, and the level of interoperability required. ; OV-4 Organizational Relationships Chart : Command, control, coordination, and other relationships among organizations. ; OV-5 Operational Activity Model : Activities, relationships among activities, inputs and outputs. In addition, overlays can show cost, performing nodes, or other pertinent information. ; OV-6a Operational Rules Model : One of the three products used to describe operational activity sequence and timing that identifies the business rules that constrain the operation. ; OV-6b Operational State Transition Description : One of the three products used to describe operational activity sequence and timing that identifies responses of a business process to events. ; OV-6c Operational Event-Trace Description : One of the three products used to describe operational activity sequence and timing that traces the actions in a scenario or critical sequence of events. ; OV-7 Logical Data Model : Documentation of the data requirements and structural business process rules of the Operational View. (In DoDAF V1.5. This corresponds to DIV-2 in DoDAF V2.0.) =Systems and services view= Systems and services view (SV) is a set of graphical and textual products that describe systems and services and interconnections providing for, or supporting, DoD functions. SV products focus on specific physical systems with specific physical (geographical) locations. The relationship between architecture data elements across the SV to the OV can be exemplified as systems are procured and fielded to support organizations and their operations. The DoDAF V1.5 SV products are: ; SV-1 Systems/Services Interface Description : Depicts systems nodes and the systems resident at these nodes to support organizations/human roles represented by operational nodes of the OV-2. SV-1 also identifies the interfaces between systems and systems nodes. ; SV-2 Systems/Services Communications Description : Depicts pertinent information about communications systems, communications links, and communications networks. SV-2 documents the kinds of communications media that support the systems and implements their interfaces as described in SV-1. Thus, SV-2 shows the communications details of SV-1 interfaces that automate aspects of the needlines represented in OV-2. ; SV-3 Systems-Systems, Services-Systems, Services-Services Matrices : provides detail on the interface characteristics described in SV-1 for the architecture, arranged in matrix form. ; SV-4a/SV-4b Systems/Services Functionality Description : The SV-4a documents system functional hierarchies and system functions, and the system data flows between them. The SV-4 from DoDAF v1.0 is designated as 'SV-4a' in DoDAF v1.5. Although there is a correlation between OV-5 or business-process hierarchies and the system functional hierarchy of SV-4a, it need not be a one-to-one mapping, hence, the need for the Operational Activity to Systems Function Traceability Matrix (SV-5a), which provides that mapping. ; SV-5a, SV-5b, SV-5c Operational Activity to Systems Function, Operational Activity to Systems and Services Traceability Matrices : Operational Activity to SV-5a and SV-5b is a specification of the relationships between the set of operational activities applicable to an architecture and the set of system functions applicable to that architecture. The SV-5 and extension to the SV-5 from DoDAF v1.0 is designated as 'SV-5a' and ‚ÄòSV-5b‚Äô in DoDAF v1.5 respectively. ; SV-6 Systems/Services Data Exchange Matrix : Specifies the characteristics of the system data exchanged between systems. This product focuses on automated information exchanges (from OV-3) that are implemented in systems. Non-automated information exchanges, such as verbal orders, are captured in the OV products only. ; SV-7 Systems/Services Performance Parameters Matrix : Specifies the quantitative characteristics of systems and system hardware/software items, their interfaces (system data carried by the interface as well as communications link details that implement the interface), and their functions. It specifies the current performance parameters of each system, interface, or system function, and the expected or required performance parameters at specified times in the future. Performance parameters include all technical performance characteristics of systems for which requirements can be developed and specification defined. The complete set of performance parameters may not be known at the early stages of architecture definition, so it should be expected that this product will be updated throughout the system‚Äôs specification, design, development, testing, and possibly even its deployment and operations life-cycle phases. ; SV-8 Systems/Services Evolution Description : Captures evolution plans that describe how the system, or the architecture in which the system is embedded, will evolve over a lengthy period of time. Generally, the timeline milestones are critical for a successful understanding of the evolution timeline. ; SV-9 Systems/Services Technology Forecast : Defines the underlying current and expected supporting technologies that have been targeted using standard forecasting methods. Expected supporting technologies are those that can be reasonably forecast given the current state of technology and expected improvements. New technologies should be tied to specific time periods, which can correlate against the time periods used in SV-8 milestones. ; SV-10a Systems/Services Rules Model : Describes the rules under which the architecture or its systems behave under specified conditions. ; SV-10b Systems/Services State Transition Description : A graphical method of describing a system (or system function) response to various events by changing its state. The diagram basically represents the sets of events to which the systems in the architecture will respond (by taking an action to move to a new state) as a function of its current state. Each transition specifies an event and an action. ; SV-10c Systems/Services Event-Trace Description : Provides a time-ordered examination of the system data elements exchanged between participating systems (external and internal), system functions, or human roles as a result of a particular scenario. Each event- trace diagram should have an accompanying description that defines the particular scenario or situation. SV-10c in the Systems and Services View may reflect system-specific aspects or refinements of critical sequences of events described in the Operational View. ; SV-11 Physical Schema : One of the architecture products closest to actual system design in the Framework. The product defines the structure of the various kinds of system data that are utilized by the systems in the architecture. (In DoDAF V1.5. This corresponds to DIV-3 in DoDAF V2.0.) =Technical standards view= Technical standards view (TV) products define technical standards, implementation conventions, business rules and criteria that govern the architecture. The DoDAF V1.5 TV products are as follows: * StdV-1 Technical Standards Profile - Extraction of standards that applies to the given architecture. (In DoDAF V1.5. Renamed to StdV-1 in DoDAF V2.0.) * StdV-2 Technical Standards Forecast - Description of emerging standards that are expected to apply to the given architecture, within an appropriate set of timeframes. (In DoDAF V1.5. Renamed to StdV-2 in DoDAF V2.0.) Version 2.0 viewpoints Diagram of DoDAF V2.0 Viewpoints.Diagram of DoDAF V2.0 Viewpoints Evolution of DoDAF V1.5 Views to DoDAF V2.0 Viewpoints.Evolution of DoDAF V1.5 Views to DoDAF V2.0 Viewpoints Mapping of DoDAF V1.5 Views to DoDAF V2.0 Viewpoints.Mapping of DoDAF V1.5 Views to DoDAF V2.0 Viewpoints In DoDAF V2.0, architectural viewpoints are composed of data that has been organized to facilitate understanding. To align with ISO Standards, where appropriate, the terminology has changed from Views to Viewpoint (e.g., the Operational View is now the Operational Viewpoint). ; All Viewpoint (AV) : Describes the overarching aspects of architecture context that relate to all viewpoints. ; Capability Viewpoint (CV) : New in DoDAF V2.0. Articulates the capability requirements, the delivery timing, and the deployed capability. ; Data and Information Viewpoint (DIV) : New in DoDAF V2.0. Articulates the data relationships and alignment structures in the architecture content for the capability and operational requirements, system engineering processes, and systems and services. ; Operational Viewpoint (OV) : Includes the operational scenarios, activities, and requirements that support capabilities. ; Project Viewpoint (PV) : New in DoDAF V2.0. Describes the relationships between operational and capability requirements and the various projects being implemented. The Project Viewpoint also details dependencies among capability and operational requirements, system engineering processes, systems design, and services design within the Defense Acquisition System process. ; Services Viewpoint (SvcV) : New in DoDAF V2.0. Presents the design for solutions articulating the Performers, Activities, Services, and their Exchanges, providing for or supporting operational and capability functions. ; Standards Viewpoint (StdV) : Renamed from Technical Standards View. Articulates the applicable operational, business, technical, and industry policies, standards, guidance, constraints, and forecasts that apply to capability and operational requirements, system engineering processes, and systems and services. ; Systems Viewpoint (SV) : Articulates, for legacy support, the design for solutions articulating the systems, their composition, interconnectivity, and context providing for or supporting operational and capability functions. Note, System has changed in DoDAF V2.0 from DoDAF V1.5: System is not just computer hardware and computer software. System is now defined in the general sense of an assemblage of components - machine, human - that perform activities (since they are subtypes of Performer) and are interacting or interdependent. This could be anything, i.e., anything from small pieces of equipment that have interacting or interdependent elements, to Family of Systems (FoS) and System of Systems (SoS). Note that Systems are made up of Materiel (e.g., equipment, aircraft, and vessels) and Personnel Types. The architectures for DoDAF V1.0 and DoDAF V1.5 may continue to be used. When appropriate (usually indicated by policy or by the decision-maker), DoDAF V1.0 and V1.5 architectures will need to update their architecture. When pre-DoDAF V2.0 architecture is compared with DoDAF V2.0 architecture, concept differences (such as Node) must be defined or explained for the newer architecture. In regard to DoDAF V1.5 products, they have been transformed into parts of the DoDAF V2.0 models. In most cases, the DoDAF V2.0 Meta-model supports the DoDAF V1.5 data concepts, with one notable exception: Node. Node is a complex, logical concept that is represented with more concrete concepts. =All Viewpoint (AV)= ; AV-1 Overview and Summary Information : Describes a Project's Visions, Goals, Objectives, Plans, Activities, Events, Conditions, Measures, Effects (Outcomes), and produced objects. ; AV-2 Integrated Dictionary : An architectural data repository with definitions of all terms used throughout =Capability Viewpoint (CV)= ;CV-1 Vision :Addresses the enterprise concerns associated with the overall vision for transformational endeavours and thus defines the strategic context for a group of capabilities. The purpose of the CV-1 is to provide a strategic context for the capabilities described in the Architecture Description. ;CV-2 Capability Taxonomy :Captures capability taxonomies. The model presents a hierarchy of capabilities. These capabilities may be presented in the context of a timeline. The CV-2 specifies all the capabilities that are referenced throughout one or more architectures. ;CV-3 Capability Phasing :The planned achievement of capability at different points in time or during specific periods of time. The CV-3 shows the capability phasing in terms of the activities, conditions, desired effects, rules complied with, resource consumption and production, and measures, without regard to the performer and location solutions ;CV-4 Capability Dependencies :The dependencies between planned capabilities and the definition of logical groupings of capabilities. ;CV-5 Capability to Organizational Development Mapping :The fulfillment of capability requirements shows the planned capability deployment and interconnection for a particular Capability Phase. The CV-5 shows the planned solution for the phase in terms of performers and locations and their associated concepts. ;CV-6 Capability to Operational Activities Mapping :A mapping between the capabilities required and the operational activities that those capabilities support. ;CV-7 Capability to Services Mapping :A mapping between the capabilities and the services that these capabilities enable. =Data and Information Viewpoint (DIV)= ; DIV-1 Conceptual Data Model : The required high-level data concepts and their relationships. ; DIV-2 Logical Data Model : The documentation of the data requirements and structural business process (activity) rules. In DoDAF V1.5, this was the OV-7. ; DIV-3 Physical Data Model : The physical implementation format of the Logical Data Model entities, e.g., message formats, file structures, physical schema. In DoDAF V1.5, this was the SV-11. Note, see Logical data model for discussion of the relationship of these three DIV data models, with comparison of the Conceptual, Logical & Physical Data Models. =Operational Viewpoint (OV)= ;OV-1 High-Level Operational Concept Graphic : The high-level graphical/textual description of the operational concept. ;OV-2 Operational Resource Flow Description : A description of the Resource Flows exchanged between operational activities. ;OV-3 Operational Resource Flow Matrix :A description of the resources exchanged and the relevant attributes of the exchanges. ;OV-4 Organizational Relationships Chart :The organizational context, role or other relationships among organizations. ;OV-5a Operational Activity Decomposition Tree :The capabilities and activities (operational activities) organized in a hierarchal structure. ;OV-5b Operational Activity Model :The context of capabilities and activities (operational activities) and their relationships among activities, inputs, and outputs; Additional data can show cost, performers or other pertinent information. ;OV-6a Operational Rules Model :One of three models used to describe activity (operational activity).

Creating an integrated architecture using DoDAF Illustration of the integrated architecture. The DODAF 2.0 Architects Guide repeated DOD Instruction 4630.8 definition of an integrated architecture as \\"An architecture consisting of multiple views facilitating integration and promoting interoperability across capabilities and among integrated architectures. For the purposes of architecture development, the term integrated means that data required in more than one of the architectural models is commonly defined and understood across those models. Integrated architectures are a property or design principle for architectures at all levels: Capability,Component, Solution, and Enterprise (in the context of the DoD Enterprise Architecture (EA) being a federation [of] architectures). In simpler terms, integration is seen in the connection from items common among architecture products, where items shown in one architecture product (such as sites used or systems interfaced or services provided) should have the identical number, name, and meaning appear in related architecture product views.\\" There are many different approaches for creating an integrated architecture using DoDAF and for determining which products are required. The approach depends on the requirements and the expected results; i.e., what the resulting architecture will be used for. As one example, the DoDAF v1.0 listed the following products as the \\"minimum set of products required to satisfy the definition of an OV, SV and TV.\\" One note: while the DoDAF does not list the OV-1 artifact as a core product, its development is strongly encouraged. The sequence of the artifacts listed below gives a suggested order in which the artifacts could be developed. The actual sequence of view generation and their potential customization is a function of the application domain and the specific needs of the effort. * AV-1 : Overview and Summary Information * AV-2 : Integrated Dictionary * OV-1 : High Level Operational Concept Graphic * OV-5 : Operational Activity Model * OV-2 : Operational Node Connectivity Description * OV-3 : Operational Informational Exchange Matrix * SV-1 : System Interface Description * TV-1 : Technical Standards Profile One concern about the DoDAF is how well these products meet actual stakeholder concerns for any given system of interest. One can view DoDAF products, or at least the 3 views, as ANSI/IEEE 1471-2000 or ISO/IEC 42010 viewpoints. But to build an architecture description that corresponds to ANSI/IEEE 1471-2000 or ISO/IEC 42010, it is necessary to clearly identify the stakeholders and their concerns that map to each selected DoDAF product. Otherwise there is the risk of producing products with no customers. DoDAF V1.5 Products MatrixDoDAF V1.5 Products Matrix The figure \\"DoDAF V1.5 Products Matrix\\" shows how the DoD Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 6212.01E specifies which DoDAF V1.5 products are required for each type of analysis, in the context of the Net-Ready Key Performance Parameter (NR-KPP): * Initial Capabilities Document (ICD). Documents the need for a materiel solution to a specific capability gap derived from an initial analysis of alternatives executed by the operational user and, as required, an independent analysis of alternatives. It defines the capability gap in terms of the functional area, the relevant range of military operations, desired effects, and time. * Capability Development Document (CDD). A document that captures the information necessary to develop a proposed program(s), normally using an evolutionary acquisition strategy. The CDD outlines an affordable increment of militarily useful, logistically supportable and technically mature capability. * Capability Production Document (CPD). A document that addresses the production elements specific to a single increment of an acquisition program. * Information Support Plan (ISP). The identification and documentation of information needs, infrastructure support, IT and NSS interface requirements and dependencies focusing on net-centric, interoperability, supportability and sufficiency concerns (DODI 4630.8). * Tailored Information Support Plan (TISP). The purpose of the TISP process is to provide a dynamic and efficient vehicle for certain programs (ACAT II and below) to produce requirements necessary for I&S; Certification. Select program managers may request to tailor the content of their ISP (ref ss). For programs not designated OSD special interest by ASD (NII)/DOD CIO, the component will make final decision on details of the tailored plan subject to minimums specified in the TISP procedures linked from the CJCSI 6212 resource page and any special needs identified by the J-6 for the I&S; certification process. Representation Representations for the DoDAF products may be drawn from many diagramming techniques including: * tables * IDEF * Entity- relationship diagrams (ERDs) * UML * SysML There is a UPDM (Unified Profile for DoDAF and MODAF) effort within the OMG to standardize the representation of DoDAF products when UML is used. DoDAF generically describes in the representation of the artifacts to be generated, but allows considerable flexibility regarding the specific formats and modeling techniques. The DoDAF deskbook provides examples in using traditional systems engineering and data engineering techniques, and secondly, UML format. DoDAF proclaims latitude in work product format, without professing one diagramming technique over another. In addition to graphical representation, there is typically a requirement to provide metadata to the Defense Information Technology Portfolio Repository (DITPR) or other architectural repositories. Meta- model DoDAF has a meta-model underpinning the framework, defining the types of modelling elements that can be used in each view and the relationships between them. DoDAF versions 1.0 thru 1.5 used the CADM meta-model, which was defined in IDEF1X (then later in UML) with an XML Schema derived from the resulting relational database. From version 2.0, DoDAF has adopted the IDEAS Group foundation ontology as the basis for its new meta-model. This new meta- model is called \\"DM2\\"; an acronym for \\"DoDAF Meta-Model\\". Each of these three levels of the DM2 is important to a particular viewer of Departmental processes: #The conceptual level or Conceptual Data Model (CDM) defines the high-level data constructs from which Architectural Descriptions are created in non-technical terms, so that executives and managers at all levels can understand the data basis of Architectural Description. Represented in the DoDAF V2.0 DIV-1 Viewpoint. #The Logical Data Model (LDM) adds technical information, such as attributes to the CDM and, when necessary, clarifies relationships into an unambiguous usage definition. Represented in the DoDAF V2.0 DIV-2 Viewpoint. #The Physical Exchange Specification (PES) consists of the LDM with general data types specified and implementation attributes (e.g., source, date) added, and then generated as an XSD. Represented in the DoDAF V2.0 DIV-3 Viewpoint. The purposes of the DM2 are: #Establish and define the constrained vocabulary for description and discourse about DoDAF models (formerly ‚Äúproducts‚Äù) and their usage in the 6 core processes #Specify the semantics and format for federated EA data exchange between:architecture development and analysis tools and architecture databases across the DoD Enterprise Architecture (EA) Community of Interest (COI) and with other authoritative data sources #Support discovery and understandability of EA data: ##Discovery of EA data using DM2 categories of information ##Understandability of EA data using DM2‚Äôs precise semantics augmented with linguistic traceability (aliases) #Provide a basis for semantic precision in architectural descriptions to support heterogeneous architectural description integration and analysis in support of core process decision making. The DM2 defines architectural data elements and enables the integration and federation of Architectural Descriptions. It establishes a basis for semantic (i.e., understanding) consistency within and across Architectural Descriptions. In this manner, the DM2 supports the exchange and reuse of architectural information among JCAs, Components, and Federal and Coalition partners, thus facilitating the understanding and implementation of interoperability of processes and systems. As the DM2 matures to meet the ongoing data requirements of process owners, decision makers, architects, and new technologies, it will evolve to a resource that more completely supports the requirements for architectural data, published in a consistently understandable way, and will enable greater ease for discovering, sharing, and reusing architectural data across organizational boundaries. To facilitate the use of information at the data layer, the DoDAF describes a set of models for visualizing data through graphic, tabular, or textual means. These views relate to stakeholder requirements for producing an Architectural Description. Relationship to other architecture frameworks The UPDM (Unified Profile for DoDAF and MODAF) is an OMG initiative to standardize UML and SysML usage for USA and UK defense architecture frameworks. In addition, the multi- national IDEAS Group, which is supported by Australia, Canada, Sweden, UK, USA, with NATO observers, has launched an initiative to develop a formal ontology for enterprise architectures.  Criticism  The efficacy of DoDAF at the U.S. Department of Defense for developing enterprise architecture has been debated: * In 2004 it was reported that \\"despite three years of effort and over $203 million in reported obligations, DoD‚Äôs architecture remains insufficiently defined, and the way in which the department makes business systems investments decisions remains largely unchanged\\".GAO (2004). DoD Business Systems Modernization: Limited Progress in Development of Business Enterprise Architecture and Oversight of Information Technology Investments.

From 1953 to 1962, during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, Sempr√∫n lived clandestinely in Spain working as an organizer for the exiled Communist Party of Spain, but was expelled from the party in 1964. After the death of Franco and change to a democratic government, he served as Minister of Culture in Spain's socialist government from 1988 to 1991. He was a screenwriter for two successive films by the Greek director Costa-Gavras, Z (1969) and The Confession (1970), which dealt with the theme of persecution by governments. For his work on the films The War Is Over (1966) and Z (1969) Sempr√∫n was nominated for the Academy Award. In 1996, he became the first non- French author elected to the Acad√©mie Goncourt, which awards an annual literary prize. Early life and education Jorge Sempr√∫n Maura was born in 1923 in Madrid. His mother was Susana Maura Gamazo, the youngest daughter of Antonio Maura, who served several times as prime minister of Spain. His father, Jos√© Mar√≠a Sempr√∫n Gurrea (1893-1966), was a liberal politician and served as a diplomat for the Republic of Spain during the Spanish Civil War.  √âmigr√©s and World War II  In the wake of the military uprising led by General Franco in July 1936, the Sempr√∫n family moved to France, and then to The Hague where his father was a diplomat, representing the Republic of Spain in the Netherlands. After the Netherlands officially recognized the Franco government in the beginning of 1939, the family returned to France as refugees. Jorge Sempr√∫n enrolled there at the Lyc√©e Henri IV and later the Sorbonne. During the Nazi occupation of France, the young Sempr√∫n joined the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans ‚Äì Main-d'≈íuvre Immigr√©e (FTP-MOI), a Resistance organization made up mostly of immigrants. After joining the Spanish Communist Party in 1942 in France, Sempr√∫n was reassigned to the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP), the Communist armed Resistance.With the agreement of the FTP- MOI, Sempr√∫n was assigned to the group Jean-Marie Action, supported by Maurice Buckmaster and the British (Sempr√∫n, Jorge. L'√©criture ou la vie, Paris: Gallimard, 1994). In 1943 he was arrested by the Gestapo and deported to Buchenwald concentration camp for his role in the Resistance.Sempr√∫n, Jorge. L'√©criture ou la vie, Paris: Gallimard, 1994. He deals with the experiences in two books: Le grand voyage (1963) treats the journey to Buchenwald, and Quel beau dimanche! (1980) his camp experiences. In 1945 Sempr√∫n returned to France and became an active member of the exiled Communist Party of Spain (PCE). From 1953 to 1962, he was an important organizer of the PCE's clandestine activities in Spain, using the pseudonym of Federico S√°nchez.Cf. Autobiograf√≠a de Federico S√°nchez He entered the party's executive committee in 1956. In 1964 he was expelled from the party because of \\"differences regarding the party line\\", and from then on he concentrated on his writing career. Sempr√∫n wrote many novels, plays, and screenplays, for which he received several nominations, including an Academy Award in 1970, and awards, including the 1997 Jerusalem Prize. He was a screenwriter for two successive films by the Greek director Costa-Gavras, dealing with the theme of persecution by governments, Z (1969) and The Confession (1970). For his work on Z, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay but did not win.Internet Movie Database: Awards for Z (1969) He was a member of the jury at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival. In 1988 he was appointed Minister of Culture in Felipe Gonz√°lez's second government, despite being neither an elected MP nor a member of the Socialist Party (PSOE). He resigned the post three years later after publishing an article openly criticising the vice-president, Alfonso Guerra, and his brother Juan Guerra. In 1996, Sempr√∫n became the first non-French author to be elected to the Acad√©mie Goncourt, which awards an annual prize for literature written in French. In 2002, he was awarded the inaugural Ovid Prize in recognition of his entire body of work, which focuses on \\"tolerance and freedom of expression\\". Jorge Sempr√∫n served as the honorary chairman of the Spanish branch of Action Against Hunger.Acci√≥n Contra el Hambre website. He lived in Paris. Marriage and family Sempr√∫n married the actress Loleh Bellon in 1949. Their son, Jaime Sempr√∫n (1947‚Äì2010), was also a writer. Later Sempr√∫n married the French film editor Colette Leloup in 1958. They had five children: Dominique Sempr√∫n, Ricardo Sempr√∫n, Lourdes Sempr√∫n, Juan Sempr√∫n and Pablo Sempr√∫n. He is the brother of the writer Carlos Sempr√∫n (1926-2009).  Style and themes  Sempr√∫n wrote primarily in French and alludes to French authors as much as to Spanish ones. Most of his books are fictionalized accounts of his deportation to Buchenwald. His writing is non- linear and achronological. The narrative setting shifts back and forth in time, exploring the past and future in relation to key events. With each recounting, events take on different meanings. Sempr√∫n's works are self- reflexive. His narrators explore how events live on in memory and means of communicating the events of the concentration camp to readers who cannot fathom that experience. His more recent work in this vein also includes reflections on the meaning of Europe and of being European, as informed by this period of history, including how Buchenwald was reopened by Soviet forces as Special Camp No. 2 of the NKVD, and then largely razed and planted over by East Germany to hide the mass graves from this second dark episode. Sempr√∫n's writing in Spanish deals with Spanish subject matter, and includes two volumes of memoirs: Autobiograf√≠a de Federico S√°nchez, about his clandestine work in and later exclusion from the Spanish Communist Party (1953‚Äì64), and Federico S√°nchez se despide de ustedes, which deals with his term of service as Minister of Culture in the second Socialist government of Felipe Gonz√°lez (1988‚Äì91). A novel in Spanish, Veinte a√±os y un d√≠a, is set in 1956 and deals with recent history in Spain.  Selected works  Sempr√∫n's first book, Le grand voyage (The Long Voyage in English; republished as The Cattle Truck in 2005 by Serif), was published in 1963 by Gallimard. It recounts Sempr√∫n's deportation and incarceration in Buchenwald in fictionalized form. A feature of the novel, and with Sempr√∫n's work in general, is its fractured chronology. The work recounts his train journey and arrival at the concentration camp. During the long trip, the narrator provides the reader with flashbacks to his experiences in the French Resistance and flash-forwards to life in the camp and after liberation. The novel won two literary prizes, the Prix Formentor and Prix litt√©raire de la R√©sistance (\\"Literary Prize of the Resistance\\"). In 1977, his Autobiograf√≠a de Federico S√°nchez (Autobiography of Federico S√°nchez) won the Premio Planeta, the most highly remunerated literary prize in Spain. In spite of the pseudonymous title, the work is Sempr√∫n's least fictionalized volume of autobiography, recounting his life as a member of the central committee of the Spanish Communist Party (PCE), and his undercover activities in Spain between 1953 and 1964. The book shows a stark view of Communist organizations during the Cold War, and presents a very critical portrait of leading figures of the PCE, including Santiago Carrillo and Dolores Ib√°rruri. What a Beautiful Sunday (Quel beau dimanche!), his novel of life in Buchenwald and after liberation was published by Grasset in 1980. It purports to tell what it was like to live one day, hour by hour, in the concentration camp, but like Sempr√∫n's other novels, the narrator recounts events that precede and follow that day. In part, Sempr√∫n was inspired by A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and the work contains a criticism of Stalinism as well as fascism. Literature or Life was published by Gallimard in 1994. The French title, L'Ecriture ou la vie, might be better translated as \\"Writing or Life\\". Sempr√∫n explores themes related to deportation, but the focus is on living with the memory of the experience and how to write about it. Sempr√∫n revisits scenes from previous works and gives rationales for his literary choices.

He was the greedy, unethical commissioner of Hazzard County. A stereotypical villainous glutton, Boss Hogg almost always wore an all-white suit with a white cowboy hat and regularly smoked cigars. His namesake is Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederate States of America. Boss Hogg is one of only two characters to appear in every episode of the TV series, the other being Uncle Jesse Duke. The role of Boss Hogg was played by Sorrell Booke, who performed frequently on radio, stage, and film prior to his role in The Dukes of Hazzard. Description \\"Boss\\" Hogg was the sole commissioner of Hazzard County, Georgia, and thus held all executive and judicial powers therein. (In real life, Georgia is the only state which still allows this form of government, and in only eight of its 159 counties.) As the wealthiest man in the county, he would do almost anything to get his hands on more money, including executing many nefarious and criminal schemes. However, he does not tolerate anyone (even the Dukes, despite Hogg's constant rivalry with them) getting physically hurt in the process (showing that he does have some scruples), he also refuses to have anything to do with illegal drugs, regardless of money, making him one of the few TV villains with any such sense of personal ethics. Boss Hogg is described in one analysis as \\"an ineffectual bad guy‚Äîhence amusing\\".John Shelton Reed, Southern Folk, Plain and Fancy: Native White Social Types (2007), p. 21. Hogg owned most of Hazzard's property and businesses, either directly or by holding the mortgages over the land. His lust for money often drove him to participate in criminal activities‚Äîusually by enlisting the aid of associates‚Äîmainly his right-hand man and partner in crime, the dim-witted, bumbling Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane. Together, the two schemed to frame the Duke family for crimes they did not commit. Rosco's deputies, Enos Strate and Cletus Hogg (Boss's cousin), have also aided Boss Hogg, though Enos (and to a lesser extent, Cletus) were decidedly more reluctant to do so. According to Waylon Jennings's narration, he had a \\"cradle to grave\\" earning plan; in that if you were a Hazzard County resident, you were born at the local hospital (owned by Hogg), you lived in a house that he owned the deed to, worked at one of his businesses, and when you died, his casket company would make your pine box. Boss Hogg's greed only seemed to fuel his lust for more and more wealth. He was chauffeured around in the back of a Cadillac (though he drove himself around in later seasons), all-white in color to match his all-white suit. Other clothing (such as jogging suits, etc.) and much of his other accessories, and much of his own mansion home, were also decked out in white. Boss is forever angry at the Duke family, particularly Bo and Luke, for continually exposing and halting his various crooked schemes. Despite the Dukes coming to his rescue on occasion, Hogg forever seems to have an irrational dislike of the clan, particularly Bo and Luke, often accusing them of spying on him, robbing or planning to rob him, and other supposedly nefarious actions as he believes they are generally out to get him. Although this characteristic is present throughout the show's run, it is particularly evident in the earlier seasons. One episode has Uncle Jesse mentioning that he and Boss had known one another \\"since we were kids\\", and others mention that they had run moonshine together. Just like the exact specifications of the Duke Boys' probation rules, the extent of just what was and wasn't within Boss's powers often seemed to vary from episode to episode. However, this can be countermanded slightly, as Boss would often bend the law and make up rules to suit himself. Every morning, Boss Hogg would drink coffee and eat raw liver (as seen in the pilot episode, \\"One Armed Bandits\\" and several later episodes). Method actor Sorrell Booke actually ate the raw liver.The Dukes of Hazzard: One Armed Bandits DVD commentary track by John Schneider and Catherine Bach Sorrell Booke was only slightly overweight at best. He wore padding under his suit to give Boss his familiar 62 inch waist. Initially the character was created as a corrupt, gruff nemesis for the Duke family to battle, but as the series evolved over its first and subsequent seasons, Hogg developed more into a comical money-grabbing villain, more intent on various get-rich-quick schemes and shady plots than ever knowingly causing anyone serious harm. With this evolution of the character, for which the foundations were set over the course of the first half-season, came the closer pairing of Hogg and bumbling Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (James Best), and as the pair's comical ability together became apparent and a popular element of the series, Booke and Best were often given permission to ad-lib and improvise their scenes together. By the time of the 1997 reunion movie, Booke had died, so rather than replace him with a new actor or similar character, Hogg's death was written into the script. He willed his empire to Rosco P. Coltrane, who continued to pursue zany schemes, many of which Boss came up with before his death. =Schemes= Criminal In a typical episode of The Dukes of Hazzard, Boss hires others to carry out his crimes, then diverts the blame onto the Dukes, usually the cousins Bo and Luke. Some of Hogg's favorite schemes include bank and armored car robbery, counterfeiting, fraud, and moonshine running. He especially enjoyed trying to trick Bo and Luke into violating their probation (for illegal transportation of moonshine) by running moonshine or crossing the county line. Boss reasons that by framing Bo and Luke, he will more easily acquire the Duke farm‚Äîthe property he most covets, and for which he held the mortgage‚Äîfor little to no cost. Usually, this is so he can develop the land (for profit, of course) in various ways. When the Dukes are not targeted, it is generally a friend of the Dukes‚Äîauto mechanic Cooter Davenport, postmistress Miz Emma Tisdale, county worker Emery Potter, general store owner Mr. Rhuebottom, and others‚Äîwho find themselves on the wrong side of Hogg's schemes. It is usually up to Bo and Luke to foil Boss's schemes, defeat his associates, and make things right. Though Boss's crimes should land him in prison, he usually winds up with little more than a slap on the wrist, such as donating his ill-gotten proceeds to charity or having to personally re-sow by hand a crop that he had destroyed. He often worms his way out of trouble by foisting the blame for his schemes onto associates. This has left him with a reputation for untrustworthiness and double-crossing in the criminal world and made many enemies who come back for revenge. Boss lusts for \\"simoleons\\", but has his limits; he refuses to risk anyone's life or safety for the sake of his schemes. More than once, he has sacrificed his potential earnings to save lives that would otherwise be imperiled by his greed (this is especially true in later seasons). His conscience has landed him into trouble with his former partners in the past. He stands by his word, but only if he \\"spits and shakes\\" on it. On several occasions, when Boss's disgruntled or devious associates attempted to exact revenge for Boss's betrayal, Bo and Luke almost always came to his rescue. Boss held various positions in the community including County Commissioner, Police Commissioner, Chief of the Volunteer Fire Department, Justice of the Peace and Bank President. All of these organizations seemed to suffer from his greed. It seems in some episodes that his position of County Commissioner is elected; Hogg was even once defeated for this office (by one vote, cast at the last minute), but Boss was back in charge in the following episode. Traffic Boss constantly looks for new, usually dishonest, methods to bring revenue into the county (and thereby, into his pocketbook). Some of the more memorable schemes involve Rosco setting up fake fire hydrants next to parked cars, using hair dryers as radar guns (to ticket people for speeding), and placing hidden stop signs or speed limit signs that mysteriously spring into view after an unsuspecting motorist drives by. Boss's traffic schemes have also resulted in country music and other performers \\"working off\\" their fines by performing at \\"The Boar's Nest\\". Famous singer victims include: Roy Orbison, Buck Owens, Mel Tillis, Dottie West, Tammy Wynette, Hoyt Axton, Johnny Paycheck and The Oak Ridge Boys twice, Loretta Lynn, and Mickey Gilley, whose performance he also tried to pirate. =Rivalries= Despite Boss Hogg's unending desire to have Bo and Luke imprisoned for crimes they did not commit, his principal rival always remained their uncle, Jesse Duke. Jesse and J.D. had a feud dating back to their ridge- running days in the 1930s, which continued to simmer after Bo and Luke were indicted for moonshine-running and Jesse began protecting them from J.D. Though they rarely got along, Jesse and J.D. held a grudging respect for one another and enjoyed a \\"friendship\\" of sorts (Jesse once claimed he and Hogg were \\"friends and enemies\\"), as both would help each other when circumstances warranted. However, Jesse Duke was well aware of J.D.'s greedy nature, and the wizened Duke patriarch frequently warned his nephews and niece about Hogg's antics. When Uncle Jesse needed a favor of Boss Hogg, he would often say \\"I've never asked you for anything\\", and the question appeared new to the portly Hogg each time. Furthermore, whenever Jesse and J.D. do formally agree to something, it is always with a \\"spit and shake\\" of hands; in one episode, J.D. insists that without \\"spit and shake\\", any promises made by him are not binding. In one episode where Hogg becomes involved with some very serious criminals who threaten Jesse's life, he intervenes and desperately insists that they don't hurt him. Despite the fact that they constantly thwarted his plots, and while he often derided them even when they were helping him, Hogg was willing to swallow his pride when the Dukes offered him aid; while the Dukes have no love for Hogg, it is clear they are aware that Boss has never willingly put lives at risk. Hogg and the Dukes appear to almost enjoy their rivalry on some level, as Hogg could easily have foreclosed on the mortgage he holds on the Dukes' land long ago, yet never has; either Boss is honest enough to accept the Dukes' payments to keep their land in their possession, or he merely wants the satisfaction of removing them via one of his schemes. (Whether Hogg genuinely wants the Dukes out of the way or is simply harassing them for fun is never made clear.) The Dukes, for their part, thoroughly enjoy their clashes with Hogg when thwarting him despite the issues he causes. Despite this, they have never made any serious attempt to have him removed from his position via any of their friends who can cross the Hazzard county line and report on his corrupt actions, indicating that they are unwilling to see Hogg truly placed in legal trouble despite all the issues he causes for them. Whether this is out of respect for Hogg's strange friendship with their uncle Jesse or not was never revealed. =Family= Boss is married to Rosco's \\"fat sister\\", Lulu Coltrane Hogg, making Boss and Rosco brothers-in-law. In the first episode, \\"One Armed Bandits\\", and referenced again in some later episodes, Boss mentions that she had him give Rosco the role of Sheriff so that he would have a safe job. It is this \\"debt\\" that, in the earliest episodes at least, seems to have Rosco continually working for Boss in repayment. As with several of the other characters, the version of Lulu seen in the early episodes is slightly different to the version portrayed later. In her lone first season appearance (\\"Repo Men\\"), she is played as spoiled (she is seen to be demanding that Boss buy her a Rolls Royce for her birthday). Her single second season appearances (in \\"The Rustlers\\") also shows her in a similar light. As the character progressed and appeared on a more regular basis in the series, the character softened, becoming a kind and more level- headed woman involved with several local charities and projects. Although in some earlier instances she didn't seem keen on the Dukes, she was more hospitable towards them, and by the later seasons was often seen to be on friendly terms with the family - particularly Jesse, with whom she would occasionally consort if she thought Boss was getting himself too deep into trouble. She and Daisy also seemed to hold a friendship as she hired Daisy into the Hazzard Equal Rights Society and in a later episode they were seen to be returning together from an out-of-town shopping trip. Although Boss frequently takes his wife for granted, Lulu has no patience for Boss's shady antics and is clearly the dominant personality in the relationship, even acting as her husband's Achilles' heel in his latest crooked scheme (and succeeding on occasion). At one point, she threatens to leave Boss and take half of his holdings; he quickly backs down. While apprehensive to trust her, and scheming behind her back at all times, Boss seems to genuinely love Lulu, frequently calling her such petnames, as \\"Angel Food Cake\\", \\"Marshmallow\\", and \\"Sugarplum Puddin'.\\" Boss also has an antithetical identical twin brother, Abraham Lincoln Hogg, who appeared in one episode of the show (the third season's \\"Baa, Baa White Sheep\\"). Also played by Booke, A.L Hogg is the opposite of J.D.‚Äîhe was kind, honest, law-abiding, dressed in black, and drove a black Cadillac‚Äîand was friendly with the Dukes, particularly Uncle Jesse. Boss and Lulu are childless, but have at least two nephews: Hughie Hogg and Jamie Lee Hogg (Jonathan Frakes). Like their uncle, both Hughie and Jamie Lee are often up to no good: Hughie (who, like his uncle, wore an all-white three- piece suit, though he drove a Volkswagen Beetle, in stark contrast to Boss's Cadillac) is often more crooked than Boss Hogg and is seen in some episodes blackmailing and using wise tactics, while Jamie Lee is seen in only one episode (see below). Deputy Sheriff Cletus Hogg is also Boss's third cousin. Jolene Hunnicutt who is a character on the sitcom Alice, is a distance relative of Hogg. Like The Dukes of Hazzard, Alice was produced by Warner Bros. Television. =Alter ego= In the third-season episode \\"The Late J.D. Hogg\\", Boss is wrongly diagnosed with a fatal illness and adopts a nice, kind persona, only to revert to his usual crooked, mean self when he learns that he is not really about to die. In \\"No More Mr. Nice Guy\\" (Episode: #7.5 ‚Äì original airdate: 19 October 1984), Boss Hogg suffered amnesia as a result of being hit on the head. When he awakened, he was a kind, caring, honest and fair man who intended to \\"clean up Hazzard County of all corruption\\". He did not like being referred to as \\"Boss\\" or even as \\"J.D.\\", instead identifying himself as \\"Jefferson Davis Hogg with two G's\\", or just \\"Jefferson\\" for short. Jefferson actually liked and appreciated the Dukes for the help they bring to Hazzard, and helped them whenever he could‚Äîuntil he received another bump on the head (many times, via Rosco) and turned back into the ruthless, corrupt Boss Hogg. =Vehicle= Boss Hogg's car was a triple white 1970 Cadillac DeVille (1976 Cadillac Eldorado in the 2005 film) convertible, with large bull horns for a hood ornament, and in the movies sported pistol shaped door handles. He had a chauffeur named Alex, who drove the car in the first few seasons; in later years, Hogg became the car's principal driver and frequently challenged others by invoking his driving expertise from his days as a ridge- runner. Unlike other vehicles in the series, Boss Hogg's Cadillac is typically handled carefully and he was always blaming Cooter if even the smallest thing went wrong. =Holdings= Some of Boss Hogg's holdings (either directly or by mortgage) include: * The Duke Farm ‚Äì Boss held the mortgage. * The Boar's Nest ‚Äì the local watering hole where Daisy Duke was employed as a waitress. Boss also has an office in the back where he does most of his dealings. * Hazzard County Bank ‚Äì the local bank where Boss served as president, owner, and chief operating officer (COO). * Cooter's Garage ‚Äì owned by the Dukes' friend, Cooter Davenport. Boss held the mortgage. * HOGGOCO Oil and Petroleum Co. ‚Äì Boss has gas stations all over Hazzard County, and Hoggoco fuel pumps in front of both The Boars Nest and Cooter's Garage. * The Hazzard County Gazette ‚Äì the weekly newspaper serving Hazzard County. * The Hazzard Phone Company ‚Äì Boss had all of the operators in his pocket, and his cousin Maybel or local girl Gussie tell him whenever any calls of interest came through Hazzard. * WHOGG ‚Äì the only radio station in Hazzard County. Boss served as president. * The Hazzard County Grits Mill ‚Äì Abandoned by Boss, only to be occupied for dubious purposes by his nephew, Jamie Lee Hogg. * High Heavenly Hill Cemetery ‚Äì Boss charged a handsome fee to be buried here, in Hazzard's only public cemetery, sometimes even double-selling plots. * J.D. Hogg Log Mill * J.D. Hogg Ice House ‚Äì Abandoned by Boss, only to be occupied by a group of crooks who are out to steal ten million dollars from armored trucks. * J.D. Hogg Real Estate * J.D. Hogg Funeral Home * J.D. Hogg Gravel Company * J.D. Hogg Painting Company * Two unnamed used car lots. One is run by a chronically-drunk moonshiner named Hobie (A. Paul Smith). The other is located in downtown Hazzard, where Boss was one of the chief salesmen. * The Hazzard Coffin Works ‚Äì Boss ran the Coffin Works as a place to store his moonshine until he abandoned it. It was taken as a hide out for the ridge-runners. Then Russel Snake Harmon used the building as a place to hide and store his rattlesnakes from Texas Ranger Jude Emery. * J.D. Hogg Investment Corporation ;Public services controlled by Hogg * Hazzard County Public Works * Hazzard County Sheriffs Department (Hogg is the Police Commissioner) * Hazzard County Volunteer Fire Department (Hogg is the Fire Chief. In some episodes Bo, Luke and Uncle Jesse also appear to be firemen, seemingly putting their differences aside for the public good, although Hogg steals the alarm fees. It is said in one second-season episode that a man named Amos Petersdorf is the fire chief and the fire truck and station are both different. It is possible that Hazzard has two fire companies with one commanded by Hogg and the other by Petersdorf) * Hazzard County Hospital (it is said in a first-season episode by the Balladeer that Hogg owns the hospital) In film In Moonrunners‚Äîthe precursor film to the Dukes of Hazzard‚Äîthe character that would go on to be developed into Boss Hogg, was named Jake Rainey (played by George Ellis). Like Boss Hogg, Jake was an old friend of Uncle Jessie, who had risen from running moonshine with Jessie in the old days to boss of the county. Jake also had the loyalty of Sheriff Rosco Coltrane, although this bond wasn't as close as it was in the TV series. Burt Reynolds played Boss Hogg in The Dukes of Hazzard (2005), the big-screen remake of the TV series. This version of Boss was far more serious and wily than his TV counterpart. Although it was indicated that this Boss Hogg enjoyed fine cuisine and had a slightly enlarged belly, he was not the overweight glutton of the television series. Chris McDonald played Boss Hogg in The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning (2007). Much like Reynolds' portrayal, Hogg was not overweight as his TV series version was, although he was decidedly taller (McDonald is 6'3\\", nine inches taller than Booke was). In video games Boss Hogg appears in the game The Dukes of Hazzard: Racing for Home, voiced by Wayne Powers. In cartoons Boss, voiced by Sorrell Booke himself, appeared in a cartoon titled simply The Dukes. This cartoon lasted for two seasons, both in 1983 for a total of 20 episodes. Reception He has been described as a \\"stereotypical corrupt public figure\\" as well as a stereotypical \\"Southerner\\".

It has been described in the media as the largest Muslim organization in North America. ISNA holds an annual national convention which is generally regarded as the largest annual gathering of American Muslims to discuss their role in society, politics, public media, activism, educational institutions, and other areas. The organization has been the subject of several controversies throughout its lifetime. History ISNA traces its origins to a meeting of several Muslim student organizations in 1963, at which the Muslim Student Association of the U.S. & Canada (\\"The MSA\\") was formed in January 1963. ISNA regards the MSA's 1963 convention as its first one, held at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Present-day ISNA was founded in 1982 through a joint effort of four organizations: The Muslim Students Association of the US and Canada (The MSA), Islamic Medical Association (IMA), the Association of Muslim Social Scientists (AMSS), and the Association of Muslim Scientists and Engineers (AMSE) - to create a community- oriented organization due to the changing nature of the growing Muslim community. Many of the leaders of these four founding organizations took leadership roles in the newly formed ISNA. In 1983, ISNA completed a $21 million ($ today) headquarters complex in suburban Indianapolis using funds raised in part from international sources. On August 30, 2013, Tahera Ahmad became the first woman to recite the Quran to open the ISNA convention, which she did at the 50th annual ISNA convention in front of a mixed-gender audience. Goals Interior of ISNA mosque ISNA's goal is \\"to be an exemplary and unifying Islamic organization in North America that contributes to the betterment of the Muslim community and society at large.\\" ISNA is an association of Muslim organizations and individuals that provides a common platform for presenting Islam, supporting Muslim communities, developing educational, social and outreach programs and fostering good relations with other religious communities, and civic and service organizations. Since 1982, ISNA's structure has changed, with several organizations either becoming defunct, or simply leaving ISNA's umbrella. Currently, ISNA includes under its umbrella: Muslim Student Association (MSA), the North American Islamic Trust (NAIT), Canadian Islamic Trust Foundation (CITF; NAIT's counterpart in Canada), Association of Muslim Scientists and Engineers (AMSE), Islamic Medical Association of North America (IMANA), and the Muslim Youth of North America (MYNA). Other organizations that either left ISNA or were disbanded include: Muslim Communities Association (MCA), Islamic Teaching Center (ITC), the Association of Muslim Social Scientists (AMSS), Islamic Media Foundation (IMF), and Foundation for International Development (FID), among others. Although each of the umbrella groups under ISNA has a seat in the ISNA Board of Directors, ISNA itself has no reciprocal seat or say in the leadership of the lower umbrella groups. Services View through ISNA window ISNA provides various services for Muslim immigrants and communities in North America. It used to publish information about Islam to be distributed with the intention of informing Muslims and non-Muslims about various issues in the religion, however this role was filled by a separate, unaffiliated organization, the Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA). They provide a forum for discussing aging and mortality as well as domestic violence. ISNA-Canada, a separately- run but loosely affiliated Canadian non-profit entity, also certifies food service and consumer products companies as Halal, and issues Islamic marriage certificates to couples with a marriage license who have performed the religious ceremony. Although only a small percentage of mosques are official members, mosque membership in ISNA is an important step for many small communities trying to grow. ISNA also offers individual membership on an annual basis and lifetime basis for sustaining donors. ISNA holds an annual national convention, typically on the Labor Day weekend in early September, which is generally regarded as the largest annual gathering of American Muslims in the United States. In the last few years, it has been held most frequently in Chicago, Illinois. The convention features Islamic lectures, discussions, debates, nasheeds, and Muslim comedy. A notable comedian who has repeatedly performed at ISNA is Azhar Usman. In 2012, the ISNA Convention was held in Washington, D.C. Deputy U.S. Attorney General, Thomas Perez, addressed the 2012 Convention, and other prominent representatives of the White House have attended in the past, including Valerie Jarrett, President Obama's Senior Advisor for Engagement and International Affairs in 2009 and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in 2016. Islamic Horizons is ISNA's bi-monthly publication of ISNA, featuring news from within the Muslim community around the nation, as well as articles addressing topics relevant to Muslim Americans. ISNA-Canada, an independent, Canadian-incorporated organization, is the operator and owner of the Islamic Society of North America Elementary School in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Organizational structure The ISNA is led by the ISNA Executive Council with decisions ratified by a Board of Directors (Majlis Ash-Shura). A prominent former president of the ISNA Executive Council was Mohamed Magid, whose term ended in 2014. The ISNA Secretary General is Hazem Bata. Azhar Azeez is the current president. Former ISNA Secretary General Dr. Sayyid Syeed is the National Director for the Office of Interfaith & Community Alliances for ISNA. Interfaith dialogue Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson at the ISNA Annual Convention in Chicago in September 2016 Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson at the ISNA Annual Convention ISNA building, Plainfield, Indiana ISNA invited Rabbi Eric Yoffie, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, to speak before its 44th annual meeting (2007). Reform Judaism is the largest Jewish denomination in the US. Yoffie denounced \\"opportunists\\" who demonise Islam, and called for an end to racial profiling and legal discrimination against Muslim Americans. Yoffie drew frequent applause, and a standing ovation. David Harris, executive director of the American Jewish Committee, criticized Yoffie. ISNA also invited Rick Warren to address the 2009 annual ISNA convention. Rabbis, evangelical and Catholic leaders were also present. ISNA has participated in interfaith dialogue with the U.S. Bishops' Committee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs. In 2016, ISNA and the American Jewish Committee formed the Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council to address rising bigotry against Jews and Muslims in the United States. Controversies =Alleged extremist ties= Former US Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ) said that the Islamic Society of North America is \\"accused of ties to Islamic extremists\\", and investigative journalist Steven Emerson accused ISNA of ties to terrorism, and argued that ISNA is not as moderate as some \\"would like to believe\\". Others such as Rabbi Marc Schneier, president and founder of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, argue ISNA and other Islamic groups are too often condemned because of \\"extreme outliers\\". =Alleged terrorist financing= ISNA was one of a number of Muslim groups investigated by US law enforcement for possible terrorist connections. Its tax records were requested in December 2003 by the Senate Finance Committee. However, the committee's investigation concluded in November 2005 having found no evidence of ties to terrorists. Committee chairman Charles Grassley said, \\"We did not find anything alarming enough that required additional follow-up beyond what law enforcement is already doing.\\" In the 2007 Holy Land Foundation terrorist financing case, the United States Department of Justice named ISNA, along with Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the North American Islamic Trust (NAIT), as an unindicted co-conspirator and one of a number of \\"entities who are and/or were members of the US Muslim Brotherhood.\\"The New Muslim Brotherhood in the West, Lorenzo G. Vidino , pp 167-186http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/423.pdf ISNA, along with NAIT and CAIR, filed motions seeking to be removed from the UCC listing, and the District Judge found that the government had violated the organizations' rights by listing them as Unindicted Co-Conspirators. Judge Solis, as affirmed by the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, held that the government should not have listed CAIR and ISNA, but that \\"the government has produced ample evidence to establish the associations of CAIR, ISNA, NAIT, with the Islamic Association for Palestine, and with Hamas\\". An audit of the separately run but loosely-affiliated ISNA Canada, from 2007‚Äì2009, found that only a quarter of the funds donated to the organization went to help the poor. Charity donations were mostly spent on the administration of the center or misdirected to private businesses. On September 21, 2013, the Canada Revenue Agency revoked the registration of ISNA Development Foundation, a defunct- charity that operated out of ISNA Canada's headquarters, due to the disbursement of funds to private businesses, including an organization linked to the Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist group. ISNA Canada was not affected by this move, and still has its charitable status, as can be found on the Canada Revenue Agency's website. =Allegations of Wahhabism= In his testimony before the US Senate in October 2003, Dr. Michael Waller told Senators, that \\"The Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) refers Muslim clerics to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. The Islamic Society of North America is an influential front for the promotion of the Wahhabi political, ideological and theological infrastructure in the United States and Canada.\\" Claiming that ISNA has connections to 50 to 79 percent of mosques on the North American continent, he accused the organization of \\"dominating Islam in North America.\\" Similarly, Stephen Schwartz described ISNA in Senate hearing testimony as \\"maintain[ing] open and close relations with the Saudi government\\". =Other controversies= A speaker at the 2009 national convention, Warith Deen Umar, a New York imam, asserted that the Holocaust happened to the Jews \\"because they were serially disobedient to Allah.\\" He went on to allege that a group of Jews close to President Barack Obama \\"control the world\\". ISNA condemned the comments. At the July 2017 annual convention of ISNA, representatives from \\"Muslims for Progressive Values\\" and Human Rights Campaign (LGBT rights groups) were asked to shut down their booth and leave, given \\"that the convention was a religious, private, and family-oriented event.\\" See also *Mahmoud Abu-Saud *Canadian Council on American-Islamic Relations *Council on American-Islamic Relations *Depictions of Muhammad *Islam in Canada *Islamic Supreme Council of Canada *Muzammil H.

She was one of a group of five women who were the first to be admitted to study at Newnham College as part of Cambridge University.  Childhood  Paley was born in the village of Ufford, near Stamford, Lincolnshire, second daughter of the Reverend Thomas Paley and his wife Judith . Her father was Rector of Ufford and a former Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge. She was a great- granddaughter of the theologian and philosopher William Paley.  Education  She was educated at home, excelling in languages: in 1871, after performing well in entrance exams, she earned a scholarship to become one of the first five students at the recently founded Newnham College in Cambridge.Mary Paley Marshall, One of Five Original Newnham College Students, Newnham College, ArtUK, Retrieved 20 February 2017 She took the Moral Sciences Tripos in 1874, and was classed between a first and second-class, though as a woman she was debarred from graduation. Paley sat the exam with Amy Bulley. They were some of the first women to take tripos examinations and they sat the exams in Marion and Benjamin Hall Kennedy's drawing room. Paley described Professor Kennedy as excitable, but he would sometimes doze whilst invigilating. The only evidence she was given of her work was a confidential letter from her examiners. Women sitting the tripos examination was a milestone for Cambridge University and the importance can be gauged by the people involved. The people who delivered Paley and Bulley's papers were Alfred Marshall, Henry Sidgwick, John Venn and Sedley Taylor. She was to pass with honours but this did not entitle her to an official degree. Cambridge was to resist recognising its own women graduates; a restriction that was, later, to be supported by her future husband. Life In 1875 she was the 25 year old economics lecturer at Newnham College. Marshall had established herself financially as she was the first women lecturer at Cambridge University. She was stylish and known for wearing clothes made from the fashionable prints designed by the Pre- Raphaelites. In 1876, she became engaged to Alfred Marshall who had been her economics tutor, and was at that time a strong supporter in higher education for women. In 1878 they moved to found the teaching of economics at University College, Bristol. Mary was one of the first women lecturers, although her salary was taken from her husband's pay as a Professor.https://www.flickr.com/photos/bristoluniversity/45949483202/in/album-72157702391602721/ In 1883 she followed him to Oxford, before the couple returned to Cambridge in 1885 where they built and moved into Balliol Croft (renamed Marshall House in 1991) on Madingley Road. Mary lectured on economics, and she was asked to develop a book from her Cambridge lectures. Mary and Alfred wrote The Economics of Industry together, published in 1879. Alfred disliked the book, however, and it eventually went out of print, even though there was moderate demand for it. Alfred had also changed his mind about women students at Cambridge. He wrote pamphlets and letters objecting to a mixed university, and in 1897 a university law was passed preventing women from being given a Cambridge degree. There is no record of her publicly disagreeing with her husband's support for the university's discrimination against women. She taught at Newnham and Girton until 1916 and the university did recognise its own would be women graduates, with a formal decree, until over 30 years after she retired. Mary was a friend of Newnham's principal Eleanor Sidgwick. In 1890 Marshall became a member of the Ladies Dining Society several of whom were associated with Newnham College. The society was started by Louise Creighton and Kathleen Lyttelton; other members of the society included Eleanor Sidgwick, the classicist Margaret Verrall, Newnham lecturers Mary Ward and Ellen Wordsworth Darwin, the mental health campaigner Ida Darwin, Baroness Eliza von H√ºgel, and the US socialites Caroline Jebb and Maud Darwin. Her husband Alfred became increasingly obstructive to the cause of women's education, believing that women had nothing useful to say.Rooms of Our Own  Lucy Cavendish College When Cambridge began to consider giving women degrees, he decided to object to the idea despite the views of friends and colleagues. Mary was nevertheless devoted to her husband, and an important unofficial collaborator in his own economic writings. Alfred's major theoretical work was Principles of Economics; he is mentioned as the only author, but Mary may have done quite as much work as he did on the book. According to James and Julianne Cicarelli, who wrote a book entitled Distinguished Women Economists, she was listed by John Maynard Keynes in his Essays on Biography. The Cicarellis say that ‚ÄúKeynes held her in the highest regard and considered her an intellectual and thinker every bit as significant to the historical development of economics as her husband or any of the other economist about whom he wrote.‚Äù After her husband died in 1924, Mary became Honorary Librarian of The Marshall Library of Economics at Cambridge, to which she donated her husband's collection of articles and books on economics. She continued to live in Balliol Croft until her death in 1944. She died in Cambridge on 19 March 1944 at the age of 93. Her ashes were scattered in the garden. Her husband is buried in the Ascension Parish Burial Ground.A Guide to Churchill College, Cambridge: text by Dr. Mark Goldie, pp. 62, 63 (2009) Mary Marshall's reminiscences were published posthumously as What I Remember (1947). Accomplishments and Work Mary Marshall took Cambridge University‚Äôs final exams, which no woman had ever done before. She passed with honours, although unofficially because for many years women were not permitted Cambridge or Oxford degrees. In 1875 Mary became Cambridge‚Äôs first woman lecturer, teaching economics at Newnham College, supposedly being adored by her students. Shortly after in 1879 Alfred and her both wrote The Economics of Industry. This book was very popular with economics students of the time, but the publishing of the book was short lived. This was because her husband Alfred wrote the far more successful, The Principles of Economy in 1890, and then saw no reason to publish their other work anymore seeing it as inferior. Though she never expressed her feelings about Alfred doing this it obviously had an effect on her because she never again published a book of her own, she just aided Alfred in his writing from this point on. Due to this it is difficult to tell the true scale of Mary Marshall's work on economics. In 1924, after Alfred's death, she used her own money to help to establish the Marshall Library of Economics at Cambridge. She worked there as a librarian until her doctors ordered her to stop, which she did reluctantly.

She is a Green Lantern successor of the supervillain Sinestro and predecessor of Sinestro's daughter Soranik Natu. Publication history Katma Tui first appeared in DC Comics' Green Lantern vol. 2 #30 (July 1964), and was created by writer John Broome and artist Gil Kane. Fictional character biography Katma Tui hails from the planet Korugar, in the area of space designated Sector 1417 by the Guardians of the Universe, the extraterrestrials from the planet Oa who oversee and administer the Green Lantern Corps. Korugar was also the home planet of the renegade former Green Lantern Sinestro, who used his Green Lantern powers to enslave his planet, and rule over them as a tyrant, unbeknownst to his Guardian superiors. Tui eventually leads a rebellion against Sinestro, and even testifies against him before the Guardians. Sinestro is imprisoned in the antimatter universe, on the planet Qward. Green Lantern Tomar-Re nominates Tui as Sinestro's replacement as Green Lantern of Sector 1417, and Tui accepts. The people of Korugar, however, came to view the Green Lantern symbol as one of oppression and pain, and saw Tui as a monster for joining them. Tui is now known among her people as \\"Katma Tui the Lost\\", as seen in Green Lantern Corps: Recharge #1 (November 2005). In her first mission, which occurred during her probationary period as a Lantern, Tui and Korugaran scientist Imi Kann destroy a giant space amoeba creature that threatens Korugar. Tui and Kann fell in love, and Tui decides to leave the Corps. Hal Jordan, the Green Lantern of Earth, uses a ruse in order to persuade her not to.Green Lantern vol. 2 #30 (July 1964) Tui went on to become an exemplary Green Lantern on a number of adventures, including a prison breakout on the Guardians‚Äô prison planet, her struggle against the telepathic influence of the alien Ffa‚Äôrzz the Mocker and her kidnapping by a group of terrorists who mistook her for Hal Jordan's love Carol Ferris.

Tui successfully recruits Rot Lop Fan who has no concept of 'color', being sightless.Tales of the Green Lantern Corps Annual #3 (1987) Tui helps defeat the extra-dimensional entity known as Maaldor, who had cut off the Lanterns from the Main Battery on Oa that powered them. She is involved with the seminal event known as Crisis on Infinite Earths and many subsequent conflicts with Sinestro. =Marriage= When Hal Jordan resigns from the Corps for Carol Ferris, Tui is infuriated, given that Jordan had persuaded her to give up Imi Kann for the Corps. When John Stewart initially turns down the offer of replacing Jordan as Green Lantern of Earth, Tui, projecting her anger towards Jordan upon Stewart, dismisses him as a coward, which provokes Stewart into changing his mind. Tui would eventually train Stewart and work closely with him on a number of missions. The two soon fall in love, and with the blessings of the Guardians they marry. During the first Green Lantern Corps story arc at the Citadel on Earth,Green Lantern Corps vol. 1 #201-224 (June 1986-May 1988) Tui works with a large contingent of Lanterns who find themselves based in California.

However, tragedy strikes once again and Hal Jordan, possessed by Parallax, destroys both the Guardians and the Central Power Battery, robbing John of his newfound powers and his resurrected wife.Green Lantern: Mosaic #17-18 (October‚ÄìNovember 1993) The Blue Lantern Saint Walker uses his blue power ring to calm John Stewart's rage from Red Lantern. By reading his psyche, the ring is able to discern that creating an image of Katma Tui would best serve this purpose. After being surrounded in an illusion of flying with his late-wife for several moments, Stewart emerges with the belief that he would be able to see Katma again.Green Lantern vol. 4 #36 (January 2009) In the Blackest Night crossover, black power rings are sent throughout the universe reanimating the bodies of the deceased. Katma Tui's name is among the first to be called out by a black ring, and she is shown reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps.Blackest Night #1 (July 2009) Katma travels on the planet Xanshi to see John and tries to weaken John by claiming that he caused the planet's destruction. However, John, spurred on by Star Sapphire Fatality's words, says that he was not the cause of it all and successfully fights off the Black Lanterns.Green Lantern vol. 4 #49 (December 2009) Black Lantern Katma is then destroyed by the combined efforts of John and Fatality.

Over 75% of the population of Pu≈Ñsk is Lithuanian. It lies in the northeastern part of Poland, only from the border with Lithuania. Pu≈Ñsk has belonged to Poland since 1920. With Lithuanian Culture House, Lithuanian high school and print house, Pu≈Ñsk is the main centre of the Lithuanian minority in Poland. According to the census of 2011, it had a population of 1,336.http://www.polskawliczbach.pl/wies_Punsk History =Early history= The oldest traces of human being in Pu≈Ñsk territory date back to about 10 000 years BC. In the early medieval ages it was inhabited by Yotvingians and Suvalkijans. In the 13th century, the Teutonic Knights exterminated them and only few of them survived. Nowadays only some castle hills (e.g. in Szurpi≈Çy), mounds (e.g. in Eglinƒó), cemeteries (e.g. in Szwajcaria), names of some villages (e.g. Zervynai, Krosna) and archaeological excavations remind us about their existence. = Grand Duchy of Lithuania = Later on Suvalkija became overgrown with forests. Lithuanian Grand Dukes hunted there. In the early 15th century the people from Merkinƒó and Punia started to colonize this territory again. They gave the name Punia to the lake, so the village was called Pu≈Ñsk after it. It was one of the first settlements in this territory. At the same time the other ones were created, such us: Ber≈æninkai, Seinai or Kreivƒónai. In 1597, the forester of Seivai, Stanis≈Çaw Zaliwski built the church in Pu≈Ñsk, and the parish has been established here. Later on the chancellery of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania published the document of the king Sigismund the Old. It was written in it that the parish priest in Pu≈Ñsk can be only a person who speaks Lithuanian. In 1647, the king W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Waza approved the civic rights of Pu≈Ñsk according to the Magdeburg rights and gave it the coat of arms with St Peter‚Äôs image. At that time the parish of Pu≈Ñsk belonged to the Diocese of Vilnius, and later (from 1795) to the bishopric of Vygriai. There was a school and a hospital by the church. In 1795, there lived 583 people in Pu≈Ñsk and in 1827 even more ‚Äì 748. From the 15th century until 1795, all of Suvalkija belonged to the Great Duchy of Lithuania. = Russian Empire = In 1827, Pu≈Ñsk had 748 inhabitants. In 1852 Pu≈Ñsk lost its civic rights. In 1881, there lived 1,200 people in the whole parish. Then the parish of Pu≈Ñsk was divided into three separate units: in Smolany, Becej≈Çy and Pu≈Ñsk. In 1910, there were 74 villages with 7,044 people that belonged to the parish of Pu≈Ñsk. From 1815 it belonged to the zone of Russian authority. People of Pu≈Ñsk area suffered from the tsar‚Äôs repressions. There were secret schools. The forbidden, illegal Lithuanian press and books were secretly transferred across the German-Russian border by the book-hawkers (knygne≈°iai). Povilas Matuleviƒçius was the most famous book- hawker in the region = Interbellum = After World War I there were fights over the Suvalkai Region, between Lithuania and Poland, a part of the Polish- Lithuanian War. Similar to the situation in other areas disputed by Poland and Lithuania, including the contested Vilnius region, a referendum which would determine which country the inhabitants of Pu≈Ñsk wanted to belong to was not held. In April 1919 Pu≈Ñsk and its territory became a part of Poland. A new border was established which has remained unchanged until now. Through 8 decades the language situation has changed to the advantage of Polish. As part of Poland, new local regulations were introduced by the government, and Lithuanians were repressed by them. During the interwar period, there were several active societies, for example St. Casimir's Society dealt with the matters of church, Rytas maintained schools, and Talka was a co-operative society. The vast majority of commerce and business belonged to Jews. They made up the greater part of Pu≈Ñsk inhabitants at that time. Some extant old houses, the building of synagogue and a big cemetery nearby Pu≈Ñsk remind of their former presence. Anti-Semitism was rampant, and many of the Jewish residents fled Polish rule. One such family was Rafalin. David Rafalin, a graduate of the Slobodka Yeshiva, became a rabbi in Cuba in 1929, then in 1933, he moved to Mexico, where he was a rabbi for 46 years. In 1931, most of the Jewish section of Pu≈Ñsk was destroyed by a fire. In Yad Vashem's Central Database of Shoah (Holocaust) Victims, more than six dozen Jewish inhabitants of Pu≈Ñsk are listed as being murdered during World War II. Some were killed in the town itself, while others were deported to camps and ghettos in Poland and neighboring Lithuania.http://yvng.yadvashem.org/index.html?language=en&s;_lastName=&s;_firstName=&s;_place=punsk = World War II = During World War II, Lithuania belonged to the zone of the Soviet Union authority and Polish-occupied Suvalkija belonged to Germany. During World War II this territory was occupied by the Germans and incorporated into Eastern Prussia. The invaders started to introduce a new order. It was decided to make a clean sweep of undesirable people in Suvalkai area. The unsuitable ones for Germanisation were killed and the favourable ones had been left to become assimilated. It was also decided to colonize this area and populate it with Germans, and resettle many indigenous Lithuanians to Lithuania, which was then occupied by the Russians. Germans did not want the territory formerly inhabited by Yatvingians, which was incorporated into Eastern Prussia, to be settled by the Lithuanians. According to the agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union on 10 January 1941, about 70% of people were expelled from the territory. Most of them returned home when the political situation changed. = Polish People's Republic = When after war regime diminished Lithuanian social and cultural life in this region became more active again. In 1956, there was established LVKD (The Social and Cultural Association of Lithuanians). Its task was to weld Lithuanians who were scattered not only in Sudowia but all over Poland. Lithuanian schools and cultural centre were established. The ensembles of the Lithuanian Culture Centre in Pu≈Ñsk perform in Poland and abroad. These are: * choreographic ensemble Jotva (established in 1951), * folk band Klumpƒó (1956), * choir Dz≈´kija (1957) * and barn theatre group. The important role in propagation of national awareness is played by the Publishing House and its periodical Au≈°ra. = After the dissolution of the Soviet Union = In 1993, LLB (Lithuanian Society in Poland) was established. One year later its offshoot - Lithuanian Youth Society was created. These organizations connect all of Lithuanians and represent their interests in and out of country. In 1994, Poland and Lithuania signed an agreement about friendship and neighbourly cooperation. New possibilities have appeared in order to communicate with Poland.

Controlled by Britain in the late 19th century, it grew out of British commercial interests in the area in the 1880s and remained a protectorate until 1920 when it became the Colony of Kenya, save for an independent country coastal strip that became the Kenya Protectorate.British East Africa CompanyKenya Protectorate Order in Council, 1920 S.R.O. 1920 No. 2343, S.R.O. & S.I. Rev. VIII, 258, State Pp., Vol. 87 p. 968 Administration European missionaries began settling in the area from Mombasa to Mount Kilimanjaro in the 1840s, nominally under the protection of the Sultanate of Zanzibar. In 1886, the British government encouraged William Mackinnon, who already had an agreement with the Sultan and whose shipping company traded extensively in the African Great Lakes, to establish British influence in the region. He formed a British East Africa Association which led to the Imperial British East Africa Company being chartered in 1888 and given the original grant to administer the dependency. It administered about of coastline stretching from the River Jubba via Mombasa to German East Africa which were leased from the Sultan. The British \\"sphere of influence\\", agreed at the Berlin Conference of 1885, extended up the coast and inland across the future Kenya. Mombasa was the administrative centre at this time.British East Africa, by Grant Sinclair However, the company began to fail, and on 1 July 1895, the British government proclaimed a protectorate, the administration being transferred to the Foreign Office. In 1902 administration was again transferred to the Colonial Office. In 1897 Lord Delamere, the pioneer of white settlement, arrived in the Kenya highlands, which was then part of the Protectorate.\\"Commonwealth and Colonial Law\\" by Kenneth Roberts-Wray, London, Stevens, 1966. P. 761 Lord Delamere was impressed by the agricultural possibilities of the area.

Lord Delamere now commenced extensive farming operations, and in 1905, when a large number of new settlers arrived from England and South Africa, the Protectorate was transferred from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. The capital was shifted from Mombasa to Nairobi in 1905. A regular Government and Legislature were constituted by Order in Council in 1906.\\"Commonwealth and Colonial Law\\" by Kenneth Roberts-Wray, London, Stevens, 1966. P. 762 This constituted the administrator a governor and provided for legislative and executive councils. Lieutenant Colonel J. Hayes Sadler was the first governor and commander in chief. There were occasional troubles with local tribes but the country was opened up by the Government and the colonists with little bloodshed. After the First World War, more farmers arrived from England and South Africa, and by 1919 the European population was estimated at 9,000 settlers. On 23 July 1920, the inland areas of the Protectorate were annexed as British dominions by Order in Council.Kenya (Annexation) Order in Council, 1920, S.R.O. 1902 No. 661, S.R.O. & S.I. Rev. 246. That part of the former Protectorate was thereby constituted as the Colony of Kenya. The remaining coastal strip (with the exception of Witu), remained a Protectorate under an agreement with the Sultan of Zanzibar.Agreement of 14 June 1890: State pp. vol. 82. p. 653 That coastal strip, remaining under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Zanzibar, was constituted as the Protectorate of Kenya in 1920. Development After 1896, immigrants from India came to the area as moneylenders, traders, and artisans. Racial segregation was normalised, with the Europeans assigning the Highlands to themselves. Other restrictions included commercial and residential segregation in the towns, and restrictions on Indian immigration. Nevertheless, the Indians rapidly grew to outnumber the Europeans by more than two to one by 1919. India was a crown colony whose citizens enjoyed certain privileges but it was unclear whether the Ishmael Indians in the African Great Lakes were to be recognised as citizens of the British Empire or as a subject race. In April 1902, the first application for land in British East Africa was made by the East Africa Syndicate ‚Äì a company in which financiers belonging to the British South Africa Company were interested ‚Äì which sought a grant of , and this was followed by other applications for considerable areas, including a large Jewish settlement. In 1902, a British soldier in East Africa described what happened in a single village: > Every soul was either shot or bayoneted... We burned all the huts and razed > the banana plantations to the ground. In April 1903, Major Frederick Russell Burnham, the American scout and then a Director of the East African Syndicate, sent an expedition consisting of John Weston Brooke, John Charles Blick, Mr. Bittlebank and Mr. Brown, to assess the mineral wealth of the region. The party, known as the \\"Four B.'s\\", travelled from Nairobi via Mount Elgon northwards to the western shores of Lake Rudolf, experiencing plenty of privations from want of water, and of the danger from encounters with the Maasai.Fergusson, W.N. (1911). Adventure, Sport and Travel on the Tibetan Steppes, p. preface. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York With the arrival in 1903 of hundreds of prospective settlers, chiefly from South Africa, questions were raised concerning the preservation for the Maasai of their rights of pasturage, and the decision was made to entertain no more applications for large areas of land. In the process of carrying out this policy of colonisation a dispute arose between Sir Charles Eliot, Commissioner of British East Africa, and Lord Lansdowne, the British Foreign Secretary. The East Africa Syndicate had applied for and been pledged the lease of of land. Lansdowne, believing himself bound by the pledges, decided the applications should be approved. In a separate matter, two South African applicants who were each attempting to lease were declined by Lansdowne, and he refused Eliot permission to conclude the transactions. In view of this Eliot resigned his post, giving his reason in a public telegram to the Prime Minister, dated Mombasa, 21 June 1904, stating: \\"Lord Lansdowne ordered me to refuse grants of land to certain private persons while giving a monopoly of land on unduly advantageous terms to the East Africa Syndicate. I have refused to execute these instructions, which I consider unjust and impolitic.\\" Sir Donald William Stewart, the chief commissioner of Ashanti (Ghana), was announced as Sir Charles' successor on the day the telegram was sent.

He most often appears in Marvel's X-Men related comic books. He is a prominent United States Senator who began his career on an anti-mutant platform and tended to be an antagonist to the X-Men team. But towards the later days of his career, he began to change his views on mutants as a whole. Publication history The character was created by Chris Claremont and John Byrne and makes his first appearance in Uncanny X-Men #135 (July 1980). Fictional character biography Senator Robert Kelly was first seen at a social gathering hosted by the Hellfire Club, where an illusion projected by the mutant villain Mastermind caused him to believe he had witnessed the X-Man Cyclops firing randomly into a crowd. He was the primary backer of the Mutant Control Act and Project Wideawake, a government program aimed at creating updated Sentinel robots that would help track down and, if necessary, detain or kill violent mutants.Uncanny X-Men #135. Marvel Comics. He played a central role in the Days of Future Past storyline. The entire plot revolved around the X-Men stopping Mystique and her Brotherhood of Mutants from assassinating Senator Kelly and thus inadvertently causing a dystopian future where mutants and other heroes were hunted down by the Sentinels and nearly totally eliminated.Uncanny X-Men #141-142. Marvel Comics. Senator Kelly was later married to Sharon, a former maid who worked in the Hellfire Club.Uncanny X-Men #246. Marvel Comics. Kelly, in a meeting with Sebastian Shaw, was shocked when his wife walked in wearing her old, servant garb as a bit of fun. She was genuinely apologetic, saying she would not have done such a thing if it hadn't been just him and Shaw. Sharon was killed in the next issue, in Uncanny X-Men #247 (August 1989), shot by the mutant-hunting robot known as Master Mold during a battle between Master Mold and Rogue. This further incited Robert's stance against mutantkind.Uncanny X-Men #247. Marvel Comics. Kelly remained an active anti-mutant activist in the comics through the 1990s but slowly became more open-minded and tolerant towards the mutant population, promising the X-Men he would work for the rights of mutants during the early 2000s. After his life was saved by the mutant Pyro in an attack (this was when Pyro was infected with the Legacy Virus) from his old teammate Post, Kelly vowed to reconsider his standing on mutants and work towards improving human/mutant relations. Despite being guarded by the X-Man Cable, he was not long afterward assassinated at a college rally (where he was speaking at the time) by the anti-mutant activist Alan Lewis who felt that Senator Kelly betrayed their anti-mutant cause. He died in Cable's arms after Cable had been too occupied helping Jean Grey save Charles Xavier on the astral plane to realize the danger to Kelly before it was too late. With his dying breaths, he pleaded for Nathan not to give up on his dream. His failure to protect the reformed Senator Kelly, coupled with his devastating loss of Moira MacTaggert who was murdered by Mystique, led Cable to leave the X-Men not long afterward.X-Men vol. 2 #108 (2001). Marvel Comics. A prison for mutant criminals called the Box was also known as the Robert Kelly Correction Facility where it was named in honor of him.X-Men Gold Vol. 2 #23. Marvel Comics. Creation The name of the character was chosen by Chris Claremont, in honor of his Bard College professor, the poet Robert Kelly. The latter has confirmed the connection between the two names in interviews among his students. Other versions =Age of Apocalypse= In the Age of Apocalypse, Robert Kelly was an activist for mutant-human peace who is eventually elected President of the United States. He named Magneto as Director of Mutant Affairs and enlisted the aid of the X-Men in the reconstruction of the broken country.Tales from the Age of Apocalypse #1. Marvel Comics. =X-Men: Noir= In the X-Men Noir reality, Robert Kelly was a Republican Senator of New York who strongly defended the controversial U.S. extraterritorial prison Genosha Bay. Kelly believed through eugenics that it is necessary for containing criminals who are more exceptionally dangerous and from \\"infecting\\" the public with their criminal ways. However, in reality, Kelly's true purpose of keeping Genosha Bay was because it was the proving grounds in recruiting the next generation of ideal soldiers and government operatives.X-Men Noir: Mark of Cain #1. Marvel Comics. =Secret Wars= During the \\"Secret Wars\\" storyline, a version of Robert Kelly existed as the appointed Baron of the Battleworld domain known as Westchester. Robert Kelly survived an assassination attempt by the Shadow King whom possessed Cassandra Nova (revealed to be a clone of Charles Xavier, created by Apocalypse) and despite being a merely \\"human\\" and remaining publicly favorable to the X-Men, Baron Kelly was secretly one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse along with Bastion, Mystique, and Exodus. He was last seen meeting with Apocalypse to plan the future for Westchester.X-Men '92 #1-4. Marvel Comics. In other media =Television= X-Men animated series. * The character (renamed Robert Jefferson Kelly) appeared in the X-Men animated series, voiced by Len Carlson. This version ran for President of the United States. Although he ran an anti-mutant campaign during season one, however, assassination attempts by Mystique (posing as Gambit to make it looks like the X-Men are responsible) and Magneto then an attempted brainwashing by Master Mold made him come to befriend the X-Men when the group had rescued him. Taking office as President, he spoke out in support of mutants and made his first presidential act being Beast's pardon. President Kelly had a low profile throughout subsequent seasons (presumably due to Graydon Creed's Friends of Humanity being made from Kelly's anti-mutant supporters), remaining a friendly ally with the X-Men to work with the group involving global threats, such as Magneto's armed asteroid in season four and as a pawn for an alien invasion in season five. Principal Kelly as seen in X-Men: Evolution. * The character (renamed Edward Kelly) appears in X-Men: Evolution, voiced by Dale Wilson. This version was the principal of Bayville High (where several X-Men attended) following his predecessor Raven Darkholme's disappearance. After Professor X had erased everyone's memories of the Brotherhood of Mutants exposing the X-Men's identities, the Professor tried to do the same thing to Principal Kelly (who was watching from afar) only to collapse. When the X-Men's identities became public knowledge, he was voting for keeping mutants out of school; the school board changed their minds after the X-Men saved their lives from the rampaging Brotherhood mutants, and their contractor Duncan Matthews, the school's football hero (who all were trying to get the X-Men expelled at Kelly's behest). After the Brotherhood's failure, Principal Kelly has the Brotherhood members expelled. Later, Kelly was pursuing a career as the city's Mayor. Wolverine and the X-Men. * Senator Robert Kelly appears in Wolverine and the X-Men, voiced by Richard Doyle. He is beginning the Sentinel project and previews the Sentinel Prowler at an anti-mutant rally, targeting Rogue in the rally group and attacks the crowd. Afterward, Kelly decides to shut down the project to focus on the Brotherhood of Mutants. He also had his agents retrieve a mutant dampening collar that could neutralize their powers but it was retrieved by Wolverine. It was revealed that Senator Kelly arranged for Genosha to be given to Magneto when they discuss the MRD holding some the powerful mutants. When Senator Kelly asks what he's going to do about it, Magneto says that is already doing it as it cuts to the Acolytes breaking into the MRD Facilities. Senator Kelly is then shown with Bolivar Trask, Sybil Zane, and Warren Worthington II when seeing the Sentinels fight the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants. Kelly also has a chat with Warren about making Warren Worthington III's status as a mutant public. Following Archangel's attack, Warren cuts off the alliance with Kelly. When Genosha closes borders, Kelly sent Gambit to take Magneto's helmet and cripple Genosha; Gambit succeeds in the latter task but loses the helmet. Magneto was ready to pummel the Senator when the X-Men intervene and Professor X showed them the apocalyptic future as the result of their war. Shocked by this revelation, Kelly shuts down Sentinel production. However, Magneto desired the war and replaced Kelly with Mystique after Magneto has Quicksilver capture him. When last seen, he was being held in a Genoshan holding cell. * Senator Robert Kelly appears in Iron Man: Armored Adventures, voiced again by Dale Wilson. This version is a rabid anti-mutant politician and is depicted as an African-American. In the episode \\"The X-Factor\\", he is shown giving a televised anti-mutant speech following Magneto's attack on Simon Trask. When Kelly gives his speech in New York about his plan to have mutants registered like guns, Magneto intends to have Annie execute a telekinetic attack on his heart to make it look like a natural death instead of an assassination, only for her to refuse. During Magneto's attack on Iron Man, Annie uses her mental powers to save Senator Kelly. However, Kelly still remains antagonistic to Annie, claiming to everyone that she was cause of the whole situation. Iron Man subsequently admonishes Kelly for his lack of gratitude and the humiliated Senator ends up leaving under a storm of protests and thrown objects from his former supporters. =Films= * Senator Robert Kelly appeared in the 2000 film X-Men, played by Bruce Davison. Just like in the comics, he is staunchly anti-mutant, arguing that they are a danger to \\"normal\\" people and should be forced to register and locked away. He is kidnapped by Mystique and Toad, and is subjected to Magneto's process that transforms him into a mutant. Unbeknownst to Magneto, the process is ultimately fatal, with Kelly's body rejecting the process despite being a malleable jellyfish-like form who has the power to stretch and can easily be squished if pressure is applied. Before he turns into water in the X-Men's custody, Kelly learns to accept that some mutants are not against humanity and is comforted by Storm. He is subsequently impersonated by Mystique at the end of the film. He is described as a Senator from Kansas, specifically in a making-of featurette screenplay, and the Mutant Watch featurette referenced him as a Republican. Also in the Mutant Watch special feature on the X-Men DVD, his young daughter is revealed as a mutant on \\"live TV\\" after a Senate hearing on mutant regulation. * Davison reprised his role as an impersonation of Mystique in the 2003 film X2. =Video games= * Senator Robert Kelly is briefly mentioned in X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse. If the player is controlling a member of the X-Men at the end of a mission to protect a Sentinel fleet (since they are being used to evacuate New York), the selected character expresses his befuddlement by saying \\"First joining up with the Brotherhood, now helping Sentinels? Next thing you know, Senator Robert Kelly is going to invite us for lunch!\\" * Senator Robert Kelly appears in Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, voiced by Peter Renaday. This version seems to harbor not only an anti-mutant sentiment but a general distrust of superheroes (somewhat in the same vein of J. Jonah Jameson). Senator Kelly is captured by Arcade and is imprisoned somewhere in Murderworld (he is located in the cart to the left when exiting the fake Castle Doom). A side-mission involves searching for him in Murderworld. If he is found, he will support the Mutant Aid Bill which will allow government funds for schools (similar to Professor X's) which will be successful in training young mutants in how to control their powers. If he is not found, he achieves freedom on his own and successfully sponsors a bill where all mutants are sent to re-education camps where they will be brutally educated to not use their powers. When freed, the player will tell Senator Kelly to find a safe place to hide until they can send some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to get him out of Murderworld. He has special dialogue with Storm when he is freed. * Senator Robert Kelly appears in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, voiced by Steve Blum. He is mentioned in a work-log in the Sebastian Shaw cybernetics lab as a supporter of Project: Wideawake.

The sorority welcomes women from all ethnic, cultural, religious and socio-economic backgrounds. Defined by diversity, Delta Xi Phi is not only multicultural in membership but also in programming since its inception. Delta Xi Phi is one of the founding members of the National Multicultural Greek Council (NMGC). Delta Xi Phi is based on five pillars: the Advancement of Women through Higher Education, Community Service, Increasing Multicultural Awareness, Sisterhood, and Friendship. National history Delta Xi Phi sorority was founded on April 20, 1994 on the University of Illinois at Urbana ‚Äì Champaign (UIUC) campus, by fifteen young women. They recognized a need for an organization that appreciated the different cultures present on their college campuses. Multicultural awareness, as well as community service, the empowerment of women in higher education, friendship and sisterhood were also important aspects of Delta Xi Phi. In the spring of 1992, two different groups of women who were seeking to establish a new sorority at UIUC learned of each other's intentions. The two groups organized a meeting where they discussed their goals and aspirations. They surprisingly overlapped and so these women unanimously decided to work together toward their common goal and the two groups merged. They decided to temporarily call themselves \\"Women for the Advancement of a Multicultural Society\\" (WAMS). Several sororities on other college campuses were contacted with the intention of establishing a chapter at the University of Illinois campus. However, none of those had everything that was wanted by WAMS. Finally, on April 20, 1993, after almost a year of searching for a sorority and much frustration, the women of WAMS made a decision to stop looking for other sororities and to commence their quest of founding their own. Three women from WAMS were designated pledge educators and helped the other twelve women's dream of founding a sorority become a reality. They went through a year-long pledging process during which they developed a strong bond of sisterhood. The foundation of their sorority began with meetings where they discussed and voted upon its letters, colors, mascot, flower, and stone. On April 20, 1994 the members of WAMS were no longer just the women of WAMS; they were to be forever known as the founding mothers of Delta Xi Phi Multicultural Sorority. On February 6, 1998, Delta Xi Phi Sorority became an incorporated entity.

The film was directed by Robert Michael Lewis and starred William Shatner and Andy Griffith, Robert Reed, Marjoe Gortner, Angie Dickinson, and Lorraine Gary. It originally aired as an ABC Movie of the Week on January 23, 1974. The film has since gained a cult following, especially due to Griffith's performance as the sociopathic villain, a drastic departure following his long run on The Andy Griffith Show. The film would lead Griffith to pursue more villainous roles over the next few years. Plot summary Baja California's location Sam Farragut is a sociopathic business executive in Southern California who forces a team of advertising agency employees, Warren Summerfield, Paul McIlvain, and Terry Maxon to embark on a dangerous dirtbike trip to the Baja California desert in order to compete for his business. Warren Summerfield is a suicidal middle- aged ad executive who has been fired from the agency; the straightlaced Paul McIlvain is inattentive to his wife, and brash art designer, Maxon, feels suddenly trapped after his girlfriend announces she is pregnant. There are numerous long sequences of motorcycle riding on desert backroads. Summerfield has been having an affair with McIlvian's wife. He has not told his wife that he was fired and is simply serving out his tenure at the agency while looking for a new position. His wife is actually aware of the affair. Farragut convinces the ad men to make the motorcycle journey on the pretext of looking for a location to shoot a commercial. In reality, Farragut is reckless and looking to involve the men in a spontaneous edgy adventure of his own manipulation. After they leave, McIlvain's wife suspects that Summerfield is planning to kill himself for the insurance money, but she cannot convince Summerfield's wife to instigate a search. The four men travel deeper into Mexico on isolated dirt roads. At one point Summerfield contemplates plunging off a cliff. After being humiliated by a young American couple in a Baja bar, Farragut tracks them down on the beach while accompanied by Maxon. He tries to offer the young man one hundred dollars in order to sleep with his girlfriend, claiming he is a \\"hippie with money.\\" Although rebuffed, he persists and is soon fought by the young man. Although the young man appears to be winning the fight, Farragut seizes an axe and destroys the radiator of the couple's car. After returning to the others, Farragut and Maxon don't inform them of the incident. They are later confronted by the Mexican police who tell them that the young man died trying to hike to safety and that the girl may die as well. Overnight in the town, Summerfield discovers the truth and tries to convince Maxon and McIlvain to help him turn Farragut in to the police. Maxon, manipulated by Farragut's promise of a promotion in the company, refuses to even admit the truth about Sam's actions, while the conflicted McIlvain resists out of prudency. The next morning, Farragut and Maxon leave on their own for the airport to fly home. They are pursued by Summerfield, who catches up to them. Maxon returns to the town, while Summerfield confronts Farragut, and says he plans to turn Sam into the authorities. Sam, in turn, reveals he knows about Summerfield's firing, life insurance policy, and his plans to commit suicide. When he is unable to either shame or manipulate Summerfield into changing his mind, Farragut pursues Summerfield across the desert in a motorcycle chase, intending to kill him. As Farragut chases Summerfield along a high cliff, Summerfield ditches his bike while Farragut loses control and plunges over the cliff to his fiery death. The three ad men return to the U.S. with Farragut's remains. McIlvain's wife informs him she wants a divorce. Maxon's girlfriend tells him she is no longer pregnant, implying she has had an abortion. Summerfield, with a new lease on life, is greeted warmly by his wife. McIlavin, knowing the truth about Summerfield's firing, offers to help him get his job back, but Summerfield refuses. Recognizing McIlavin's compliancy and cowardice, Summerfield warns him that no matter how different things may look, he is going to have to deal with the \\"Sam Farraguts of the world\\" and what they represent.

Biography At the beginning of the American Civil War he was attending the University of Georgia where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree just before the institution was shut down in September 1863. He then served as a captain in the Confederate army. After the war, on April 23, 1873, he married Helen Augusta Garrard (1850‚Äì1924) of Columbus, Georgia, where her father William Waters Garrard (18181866) practiced law. They had four children who lived to adulthood: Isa Garteray Urquhart Glenn (18741951), a novelist and contemporary of Ellen Glasgow; Garrard Glenn (18781949), noted attorney in New York City and subsequently professor of law at The University of Virginia; Helen Mildred Lewis Glenn (18851971), who married Theodore Gordon Ellyson of Richmond, Virginia, the first Naval aviator; and William Louis Glenn (1887‚Äì1950), an attorney in New York City. Glenn practiced law in Atlanta, served as Atlanta's mayor, and died less than a decade later.

It gained particular notoriety for a mob attack and murder of an innocent man, Alain de Moneys, at the time of the Franco-Prussian War, in mid-August 1870. History =Killing of Alain de Mon√©ys= On 16 August 1870, France was losing the war against Prussia. Within three weeks, Emperor Napoleon III would be captured by the enemy and his regime overthrown by a self-proclaimed Government for National Defence. Rural France, which had largely been faithful to Napoleon I and welcomed his nephew, was tense. Many rural residents were illiterate and depended upon news of the war from educated, often noble residents, which they resented. During a fair at Hautefaye, matters turned ugly when an aristocratic cousin of a young nobleman named Alain de Mon√©ys reported the war was not going well. Many villagers had been drinking and received the news poorly. They attacked the cousin, the Vicomte Camille Maillard Lafaye, son of the mayor of the nearby town of Beaussac. Frightened, the viscount and his party fled. In an alcohol-fueled patriotic fervor, villagers wielding pitchforks and cudgels turned their attention on young Alain. They accused him of being a Prussian plant, a spy, and of financing Prussia in the war against France. They claimed he betrayed the emperor and nation. Both claims were in fact false, as Mon√©ys was not a Republican and his patriotism was spotless, but a crowd gathered around him. The parish priest tried to calm the mob by offering drinks to divert their attention but, however well-meaning the effort may have been, it probably helped get the crowd even more intoxicated than they already were and more dangerous. The mayor, unable to show leadership in the face of drunken excitement, reportedly said \\"Eat him if you want\\". For two hours, the mob tortured and battered Alain de Mon√©ys. They nailed horseshoes to his feet and burst one of his eyeballs. The crowd finally burnt him in the village square (or a nearby lake bed), likely while still alive. It is alleged that those who took part in the killing collected fat dripping from his burning body onto bread, eating the resulting tartines. (The last statement has not been proved historical). Judgment Some 600 festival attendees were implicated in the affair. On 19 August 1870, gendarmes arrested fifty people ranging in age from age 14 through 60. On 18 September 1870, twenty-one defendants were informed of charges against them. During 13‚Äì21 December 1870, perpetrators were brought to trial in the town of P√©rigueux. Nineteen were convicted, four sentenced to death. Judge Brochon, from the Bourdeaux Court of Appeals, presided over the Dordogne Criminal Court in this instance. Altogether, four individuals were judged to have primary culpability and sentenced to death, while another received a sentence of life imprisonment. Others received sentences ranging from six to eight years imprisonment with hard labour for their role in the atrocity. Another group was sentenced to a single year of imprisonment. One teenager, then aged fourteen years of age, was sentenced to six years in a reformatory, while a small child was acquitted. On 6 February 1871, the four participants judged most complicit for the murder of Mon√©ys were guillotined in the Hautefaye village square. Aftermath In 1953, Lavaud Noemie, the last direct witness of the Hautefaye Affair, died at 92 years of age. On 16 August 1970, a century after the tragedy and at the initiative of one of the villagers, the Hautefaye church held a \\"Mass of forgiveness\\" in the presence of descendants of the family of Alain of Mon√©ys and those of his killers. Jean Teule has since written an historical novel on the subject, Eat Him if You Like (2009: English Translation: 2011).

It is produced by WNYC in New York City. OTM is first broadcast on Friday evening over WNYC's FM service and is syndicated nationwide to more than 400 other public radio outlets. The program is available by audio stream, MP3 download, and podcast. Full episode podcasts began in August 2005. OTM also publishes a weekly newsletter featuring news on current and past projects as well as relevant links from around the web.  Format  As defined by co-host Garfield, On the Media covers \\"...anything that reaches a large audience‚Äîeither electronically or otherwise.... Plus, throw into that anything that covers First Amendment issues; anything that has to do with freedom of speech, privacy, is also in our portfolio\\".Thorn, Jesse. \\"On the Media Hosts Brooke Gladstone and Bob Garfield: Interview on The Sound of Young America\\". (April 13, 2009). The show explores how the media are changing, and their effects on America and the world. Many stories are centered on events of the previous week and how they were covered in the news. These often consist of interviews with reporters about the dilemmas they face in covering controversial issues. Stories regularly cover such subjects as the use of video news releases, net neutrality, digital broadcast flags, media consolidation, censorship, freedom of the press, the influence of 24-hour cable news television coverage, media oppression, and how the media are changing with technology. The show also addresses questions about how the media is influenced or spun by politicians, corporations, and interest groups with the intent to shape public opinion. This includes an OTM feature that covers the media's use of terminologies that may engender biased points of view, and the use of hot-button issues and code words, such as Michael Moore, torture, evangelical, and islamofascist. The show also runs a series entitled Breaking News Consumer's Handbook, which offers lists of advice on how to properly report or react to different types of recent events in the news.  History  On the Media first aired February 7, 1993 on WNYC as a local call- in show, first hosted by Brian Lehrer and later, by Alex S. Jones. During its first episodes it was called \\"Inside Media\\", but the title was changed to avoid confusion with a same-named trade publication. In 1997 the show went national in a magazine-style format, hosted by WNYC host Brian Lehrer. During this period, this show was hampered by Lehrer being stretched thin, due to commitments from his own daily show, inexperienced producers, and the lack of an editor. In late 2000, Gladstone was brought in by WNYC's director of programming to rethink and relaunch the show.\\"Brooke Gladstone\\", The Transom Review vol. 4, issue #1 (March 1, 2004).

It is situated about 250 yards to the south of junction 6 of the inner ring road. The station is on the Birmingham loop of the West Coast Main Line (WCML), and is at the centre of a junction where the lines to Nuneaton, and to Leamington converge. Coventry station has regular services between London Euston and Birmingham New Street on the WCML. Other services are extended to/from Wolverhampton, Shrewsbury, Preston, Glasgow and Edinburgh Waverley. There are also long distance CrossCountry services to Manchester to the north, and Oxford and Bournemouth to the south. Local services also operate between Coventry-Nuneaton, Northampton and Leamington Spa. The station has the PlusBus scheme where train and bus tickets can be bought together at a saving. History The original station was built in 1838 as part of the London and Birmingham Railway and could be entered from Warwick Road, where two flights of stairs took the passengers down to the platform. Within two years it had been replaced, with a new larger station, a few hundred feet nearer to Rugby, this time, accessed via Eaton Road. In the late 19th century the Coventry tram network extended to the station at Eaton Road. The original station remained in service as the station masters offices, until the station was redeveloped in the early 1960s by the London Midland Region of British Railways. Coventry station in 1962, shortly after being rebuilt The new 1840 station saw a significant number of modifications and extensions over the years, there was an engine shed, water column and turntable, in its later days an inclined walkway from the platform directly to Warwick Road for summer excursions, and a parcel depot formed from old carriages. However, the station was constrained by bridges at either end of the station, Stoney Road Bridge to the south, and Warwick Road bridge to the north. The bridges effectively restricted the station to two lines, and prevented the platforms from being extended. In the early 1960s both bridges were widened, and the old station finally demolished and re-built, this time with room for four platforms instead of two. At the time it was demolished in 1960, some parts of the old station were 120 years old. The station comprises a two-storey height booking hall with reinforced concrete frame, linked across an adjoining platform by a bridge to an island platform and a single sided platform. It was built to the designs of W R Headley, Regional Architect of the London Midland Region of British Railways and Derrick Shorten, the project architect. It was formally reopened on 1 May 1962.\\"Coventry Station Reconstruction\\" Railway Gazette 13 March 1959 page 316\\"New Station at Coventry\\" Railway Gazette 4 May 1962 page 526\\"Rebuilding Coventry Station\\" Railway Gazette 11 May 1962 page 544 In 1995 it became a Grade II listed building.\\"Around the Regions\\" Rail Magazine issue 250 12 April 1995 page 46\\"1960s railway structures given listed status\\" The Railway Magazine issue 1137 January 1996 page 11 The new station featured a new parcel depot, used to manage the large number of mail order catalogue packages coming into Coventry at the time. The depot was serviced by its own platforms from the Rugby end. The depot has now been replaced by a multi-storey car park, although some of the platforms and an electrification gantry remain. A ¬£91 million redevelopment of the station is proposed to commence in 2019. A new bay platform is planned as part of this development. From the mid-2020s Coventry station is also planned to be served by the Coventry Very Light Rail system. Motive Power Depot The London and Birmingham Railway opened a small motive power depot at the west end of the station in 1838. This was replaced by a larger depot in the fork between the Leamington and Rugby lines, in 1866. This was enlarged in 1897 and rebuilt in 1957 but closed 17 November 1958 and was demolished.Roger Griffiths and Paul Smith, The directory of British engine sheds:1 (Oxford Publishing Co., 1999), p.163. . Locomotives were then serviced at the former Great Western Railway depot at Leamington Spa. Services Coventry station from above in 2018 The station is served by Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry and West Midlands Trains. In the past, it has also been served by Silverlink, but these routes were transferred to Central Trains in 2004. Central Trains and Virgin CrossCountry services were respectively transferred to London Midland and CrossCountry in 2007. There is a small yard at the Birmingham end of the station, in front of the shopping centre that was once part of Coventry's yard, that is used by London Midland for the stabling of electric traction units, no heavy work is carried out at Coventry as that is done at either Soho TMD (for Class 323s) or Northampton Siemens depot (Class 350s). All diesel units are stabled at Tyseley TMD where they are cleaned, maintained and refuelled. These units are only used on the local service to Nuneaton. Until 2004, Coventry had a direct service to Nottingham via Leicester, but this was discontinued because Network Rail took away the ability for trains coming from Coventry to cross to the Leicester line at Nuneaton. , the off-peak day time service pattern is: *There are 6 trains per hour to , calling at none, some or all of , , or . *7 trains per hour to Birmingham New Street *1 CrossCountry train per hour to Bournemouth via Southampton, Reading, Oxford and Leamington Spa *1 CrossCountry train per hour to Manchester Piccadilly via Birmingham New StreetGB National Rail Timetable May 2016, Table 51 *1 train per hour to Liverpool via Stafford and Crewe *1 train per hour to Rugeley Town *1 train per hour to or Edinburgh Waverley via & *1 train per hour to NuneatonGB National Rail Timetable May 2016, Table 63 *1 train per hour to Leamington Spa via Kenilworth =Service summary= Station facilities In addition to the usual ticket office, the station has a travel centre for information, tickets for advance travel, ferry services, for rail passes, and other services.

Biography =Early years and education= Hemphill was born on May 5, 1842, in Athens, Georgia. He attended the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens, where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society and earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1861 in engineering. =Business ventures= At the beginning of the Civil War Hemphill joined the Confederate Army, rising to the rank of colonel. He suffered a serious head wound at the Battle of Gettysburg. After the war, he moved to Atlanta in 1867, to teach. Within one year, Hemphill accepted an offer from Carey Wentworth Styles, to become the business manager and co-owner in a new joint venture with Styles and James Anderson. They had just purchased a small newspaper, the Atlanta Daily Opinion which they renamed. The Constitution was first published under that name on June 16, 1868. Styles quickly fell into financial difficulty, when he was unable to sell his interests in a struggling Albany, Georgia newspaper, The Albany News. With his inability to raise capital, Styles could not pay for his purchase of The Constitution. His ownership in the newspaper was assumed by Anderson and Hemphill. Hemphill, who became Anderson's son-in-law in the subsequent six months was placed in full charge of the Atlanta publication. Hemphill continued in his position as business manager of the paper until 1901. Hemphill's business acumen helped get the fledgling newspaper on sound financial footing. In active competition with other Atlanta newspapers, Hemphill hired special trains (one engine and car) to deliver newspapers to the Macon marketplace. In 1870 Anderson sold his one half interest in the paper to Col. E. Y. Clarke. In 1876 Clarke sold his half interest in the paper to Evan Howell. Howell's family would come to own The Atlanta Constitution from 1902 to 1950. In 1883, Hemphill was one of a group of investors who incorporated the Fulton County Street Railroad (horse cars), which was later electrified, and became famous for its Nine-Mile Circle route to what is now Virginia-Highland. =Political service= Hemphill was first elected to the position of (Atlanta) city councilman-at-large in 1887, the same year he began an unsuccessful banking career. The next few years he served as president of the board of education and in 1889 added alderman duties. While still in control of the Constitution in 1890 he defeated a Black mayoral candidate known now only as \\"McKinley\\", by 1,773 votes, and took office the next year. During his tenure the first building of what became Grady Memorial Hospital was built and a fresh-water pumping station was established on the Chattahoochee River replacing the need for various wells and cisterns (for fires). Part of the purchased for the associated reservoir included a newly built street named in his honorHemphill Ave. After leaving office, Hemphill read about the Cotton Palace in Waco, Texas, and suggested that Atlanta could stimulate growth by hosting what would become the Cotton States and International Exposition of 1895. He later served as vice president and director of the Exposition. Death and legacy Hemphill died suddenly on August 17, 1902, from injuries sustained in a fall. He is buried at Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta.

The seasoning mix includes celery salt, black pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, and paprika. It is regionally popular, specifically in Maryland, as well as in the Mid-Atlantic States, the Southern States, and parts of New England and the Gulf Coast. History Old Bay Line, after which Old Bay is named Old Bay Seasoning is named after the Old Bay Line, a passenger ship line that plied the waters of the Chesapeake Bay from Baltimore to Norfolk, Virginia, in the early 1900s. In 1939, a Jewish-German immigrant named Gustav Brunn started the Baltimore Spice Company. Gustav had previously been fired from McCormick after just two days on the job when his employer found out that he was Jewish. The origins of the company began in Wertheim, Germany, where Brunn started a wholesale spice and seasoning business selling to food industries, seeing an opportunity as spices were in especially short supply amidst hyperinflation in the aftermath of World War I. Due to rising anti-Semitism as the Nazi Party rose to power, the company moved to Frankfurt, Germany; however, on the night of November 10, 1938, a massive pogrom against Jews, known as Kristallnacht, led to Brunn being arrested by Nazi soldiers and sent to Buchenwald concentration camp. According to Brunn's son, Gustav's wife paid a large sum of money to a lawyer for him to be released, and as they had already applied for and received American passports, were able to escape with their two children to New York City, and later Baltimore, Maryland, where Brunn had family. There, having brought with him only a small spice grinder, Brunn first produced the \\"Delicious Brand Shrimp and Crab Seasoning\\", which was later renamed Old Bay. The rights to the seasoning brand were purchased by McCormick & Co in 1990. McCormick continued to offer Old Bay in the classic yellow can. Gustav Brunn had worked for McCormick for a short time before starting his own spice business. McCormick has a number of other products under the Old Bay banner, including seasoning packets for crab cakes, salmon patties and tuna, tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, and seafood batter mix. They also make other seasoning blends that mix Old Bay seasoning with garlic, lemon, brown sugar, herbs and blackened seasonings. McCormick has offered a lower-sodium version of Old Bay Seasoning. In 2017, McCormick changed the packaging from metal cans to plastic containers in an effort to reduce the packaging costs. Usage Old Bay is also now available in a standardized foodservice package but retains its distinctive yellow label. Putting Old Bay on crab legs. The seasoning is chiefly used to season crab and shrimp. It is also used in various clam chowder and oyster stew recipes. The seasoning is also used as a topping on popcorn, salads, eggs, fried chicken, french fries, tater tots, corn on the cob, boiled peanuts, dips, chipped beef, baked potatoes, potato salad, potato chips, and guacamole. Several movie theaters in the Chesapeake region offer it in the condiment section. Potato chip manufacturer Utz created the original \\"Crab Chip\\" based on a similar mix of spices. The popular potato chip variety was later copied and marketed by Herr's Snacks (however, Herr's uses Old Bay seasoning and it is sold as \\"Herr's Old Bay Chips\\"). Lay's introduced its own Old Bay-seasoned \\"Chesapeake Bay Crab Spice\\" flavored chips in 2018. Early in its history, the Subway sandwich shop used Old Bay when mixing their seafood and crab salad. Many local Subway shops still have Old Bay for use on sandwiches. Old Bay is also occasionally used around the Chesapeake Bay region as an ingredient in Bloody Marys, and even in places as far south as The Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach, Florida. Some bars in the Baltimore region also often sell what is known as a 'Crabby Bo', which is National Bohemian beer where the lip of the glass or mug that is being used is moistened and dipped into a container of Old Bay seasoning. In 2014, the Maryland-based brewery Flying Dog created an Old Bay- inspired summer ale named Dead Rise to celebrate the seasoning's 75th anniversary. In 2020, McCormick created Old Bay Hot Sauce in advance of the Super Bowl, which initially sold out within 30 minutes of its launch and caused the Old Bay website to temporarily crash. Some customers resold the 10-ounce bottles, retailing for $3.49, online for between $50 to $200.

His genres include high fantasy (set in various fictitious worlds), science fiction, horror fiction, and crime fiction. His primary setting, Mithgar, was originally meant to host Middle- Earth stories that were sequels to Tolkien's work. It has since grown to reflect a much broader variety of influences, including \\"fairy tales and Oz books and folk tales and other such stories\\".  Biography  McKiernan was born in Moberly, Missouri, where he lived until he served the U.S. Air Force for four years, stationed within US territory during the Korean War. After military service, he attended the University of Missouri and received a BS in electrical engineering in 1958 and an MS in the same field from Duke University in 1964. He worked as an engineer at AT&T;, initially at Western Electric but soon at Bell Laboratories, from 1958 until 1989. In 1989, after early retirement from engineering, McKiernan began writing on a full-time basis. In 1977, while riding his motorcycle, McKiernan was hit by a car that had crossed the center-line, and he was confined to a bed, first in traction and then in a hip spica cast, for many months. During his recuperation, he began a sequel to J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The publisher Doubleday showed an interest in his work and tried to obtain authorization from Tolkien's estate but was denied. Doubleday then asked McKiernan to rewrite his story, placing the characters in a different fictitious world, and also to write a prequel supporting it. The prequel, of necessity, resembles The Lord of the Rings; the decision of Doubleday to issue the work as a trilogy increased that resemblance; and some critics have seen McKiernan as simply imitating Tolkien's epic work. McKiernan has subsequently developed stories in the series that followed along a story line different from those that plausibly could have been taken by Tolkien. McKiernan's Faery Series expands tales drawn from Andrew Lang's Fairy Books, additionally tying the selected tales together with a larger plot. McKiernan currently lives in Tucson, Arizona.

The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida-based Ion Media Networks (the former Paxson Communications). WYPX-TV's offices are located on Charles Boulevard in Guilderland, and its transmitter is located in the Helderberg Escarpment in New Scotland. The station also serves as the de facto Ion outlet for the Mohawk Valley (including Utica). History The station signed on the air in 1987 as an independent station under the call letters WOCD. It was owned by Amsterdam Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Coit Services of San Francisco, and was leased to Christian Community Television (CCT) of Schenectady, New York. CCT faced financial troubles from the outset and they soon fell behind on their payments, so Amsterdam Broadcasting reassumed control of the station. The station went dormant in 1989, but in 1991, Coit struck a deal to sell the station to Tennessee TV executive Wade Griffith for $1.8 million. Griffith would have relaunched the station as WNSI, but the deal fell through, and WOCD was sold to Cornerstone Television, a religious broadcaster, for $375,000 in 1992. The second incarnation of WOCD had problems getting cable carriage in much of the market which combined with the looming conversion to digital television led the station to be sold again. In 1997, Paxson Communications bought WOCD from Cornerstone, moved the station's offices from Scotia, New York to Guilderland, and made the station an outlet for the Infomall Television Network (inTV). The call sign was changed to WYPX on January 13, 1998; however, the new calls confused some people as there was a radio station with a similar call sign in the Albany market. WYPX became a charter station for the Pax TV network when it launched on August 31, 1998. WYPX also added a secondary affiliation with UPN on October 5, 1998, airing the network's programming in late night hours following Pax's primetime programming. WVBG-LP (channel 25), a low-power station in Albany, also joined UPN as a primary affiliate the same day; the affiliation deal with WYPX was made before the network agreed to affiliate with WVBG (as Albany had no UPN affiliate at the time, though area cable systems imported WSBK-TV from Boston). WYPX retained its secondary UPN affiliation despite WVBG's affiliation; however, UPN programming disappeared from channel 55 in 1999. In 2001, WYPX entered into a joint sales agreement with Hubbard Broadcasting, owner of NBC affiliate WNYT (channel 13); under this arrangement, WNYT sold advertising time on WYPX, while WYPX aired replays of WNYT's news and public affairs programming. Paxson terminated all joint sales agreements involving its stations in June 2005 as part of its relaunch of Pax TV as i: Independent Television. Digital television =Analog-to- digital conversion= WYPX-DT signed on the air on UHF channel 50 and broadcasts at 450 kW from the same transmitter site in early 2005. WYPX-TV requested permission from the FCC to shut down their analog signal on channel 55 so that the bandwidth could be used for Qualcomm's MediaFLO service. Qualcomm had made deals with other stations on channel 55, including WLNY of Riverhead, New York, to shut down analog so that they could launch their new multimedia offering on April 12, 2007. It was granted permission by the FCC to shut down its analog broadcast, surrender its analog license, and operate as a digital-only station on channel 50 on September 6, 2007. The station shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 55, on September 28, 2007. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 50. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 55, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition.

Grant and Rachel Ward. The title is a pun and can be literally taken as \\"How to Get a Head in Advertising\\". Plot The film is a farce about a mentally unstable advertising executive, Denis Dimbleby Bagley (played by Grant), who suffers a nervous breakdown while making an advert for pimple cream. Ward plays his long-suffering but sympathetic wife. Richard Wilson plays John Bristol, Bagley's boss. Bagley has a crisis of conscience about the ethics of advertising, which leads to mania. He then develops a boil on his right shoulder that comes to life with a face and voice. The voice of the boil, although uncredited, is that of Bruce Robinson. The boil takes a cynical and unscrupulous view of the advertising profession in contrast to Bagley's new- found ethical concerns. Eventually, Bagley decides to have the boil removed in hospital but moments before he is taken into the operating room, the boil quickly grows into a replica of Bagley's head (only with a moustache) and covers Bagley's original head, asking doctors to lance it, which is done since nobody has noticed the switch from left to right nor the new moustache. Bagley, now with the boil head, moustache, and personality (the movie's third personification from Grant after the stressed executive and the raving lunatic) returns home to celebrate his wedding anniversary, with the original head merely resembling a boil on his left shoulder. The \\"boil\\" eventually withers but doesn't die, yet Bagley resumes his advertising career rejuvenated and ruthless, although without his wife, who decides to leave his new cruel persona.

They are related to the Agaw people in Ethiopia. The Qemant people traditionally practiced an early Hebraic religion, however most members of the Qemant are followers of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Despite their historic relationship, they should not be confused with the Beta Israel. The ethnicity's population is reported to be 172,000, according to the 1994 national census;and 169000 according to the 1984 Ethiopian Census. 1994 Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia: Results for Amhara Region, Vol. 1, part 1 , Table 2.7 (accessed 6 April 2009) the latest available national census, the one performed in 2007, does not list them as a separate group.\\"Census 2007\\" , first draft, Table 5. However, only 1,625 people still speak Qimant, and it is considered endangered, as most children speak Amharic; likewise, adherence to the traditional religion has dropped substantially, as most of the population has converted to Christianity. Converts often consider themselves to have become Amhara. Historically, there was a constant effort to assimilate the Qemant people to the Amhara people. This resulted in the alarming decrease of the number of people who speak the Qemant language. In the 2007 Ethiopian Census, the Qemant people were not counted as a separate ethnic group. This is one of the most extreme examples of the efforts to assimilate the Qemant to the Amhara, and thus deny the ethnic identity of the Qemant people. The Qemant live along an axis stretching from Ayikel in Chilga woreda to Kirakir and north to Lake Tana in the woredas of Lay Armachiho. Most remaining speakers of the language are near Ayikel, about west of Gondar. They are mainly farmers. The Qemant are divided into two patrilineal moieties, the Keber and the Yetanti; the Keber is higher in rank. A traditional Qemant can only marry a member of the other moiety, so, while the moieties are exogamous, Qemant society as a whole is endogamous.Gamst (1969), p.67 Religion The Qemant traditionally practiced a religion which is often described as \\"Hebraic\\" . According to the American anthropologist Frederic C. Gamst, their \\"Hebraism is an ancient form and unaffected by Hebraic change of the past two millennia\\". A recent sociolinguistic survey notes that the Qemant religion is in a very precarious situation since very few people still adhere to it due to rapid assimilation. According to this study, the ratio of those who follow the Qemant religion vs. those who are baptized and converted to Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity is about 1% vs. 99%.Leyew (2002), p. 8. Their religious observances include a literal reading of the 11th chapter of Leviticus (see Kashrut). As with mainstream Judaism, even permitted animals can only be consumed if they are properly slaughtered (see Shechita). Their practices include continued animal sacrifices, and the tending of sacred groves (called degegna). Worship is conducted outdoors, usually at a site near a sacred tree (called qole), wrapped in variously-colored strips of cloth. This appears to be a survival of a biblical tradition: :Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there the name of God (Genesis 21:33). and :..where the women wove hangings for the grove (II Kings 23:7). However, due to their dislike to being observed by the increasingly pervasive Christians, they eventually constructed a prayer-hall at Chelga.Gamst (1969), p. 27 The Sabbath is observed on Saturday, when it is forbidden to light a fire. The extent as to which they observe other prohibitions often found in Judaism is unclear. The Qemant call their Deity Adara (God) or Yeadara (My God) or Mezgana, which might to be a proper name. He is described as omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient, and anthropomorphic. He is approachable directly or through qedus which are angels or culture heroes.Gamst (1969) pp. 34-37 The highest political and religious leader among the Qemant is their High Priest, called the Wember (also transliterated Womber and Wambar), an Amharic term meaning \\"seat.\\" There were formerly two superior wambars, at Karkar and at Chelga, with the first being senior, and a varying number of subordinate wambars in other parts of Qemantland. All wambars are chosen from certain lineages in the Keber moiety. The last wambar of Karkar died in 1955, and since then the only wambar has been Mulunah Marsha, Wambar of Chelga (born 1935). Each wambar chose (from the Keber moiety) one or more delegates with the title of afaliq to represent him in judicial matters. These men traveled the countryside, settling disputes, seeing that the laws were obeyed, and punishing wrongdoing, usually with a fine.Gamst (1969), p. 62 Each wambar also chose two stewards with different titles, one from each moiety, who served different elements of the sacred meals.Gamst (1969), p.43 There are two orders of priesthood, the kamazana, the higher, of the Keber moiety, and the abayegariya, the lower, of the Yetanti moiety. Each Qemant locality has at least one of each; they must work together to conduct the traditional sacrifices and other religious ceremonies. When offering a sacrifice, the abayegaria holds the legs of the victim and the kamazana wields the knife. The priests also have a subordinate judicial function. History The origins of the Qemant are unknown due to lack of a written history. According to the early 19th century missionary Samuel Gobat, their Amharic-speaking neighbors considered the Qemant boudas, or sorcerers, along with \\"the Falashas or Jews (Beta Israel), most Mussulamns (Muslims), and some Christians.\\" Gobat knew little more about this \\"small Pagan people inhabiting the mountains in the vicinity of Gondar.\\"Samuel Gobat, Journal of Three years' Residence in Abyssinia, 1851 (New York: Negro Universities Press, 1969), p. 263 The Qemant were especially subject to Ahmarization between 1889 and 1913 during the reign of Emperor Minilik II. Writing in 1967, US anthropologist F. Gamst said he expected total assimilation of the Qemant with the Amhara within three decades. However in the modern era, Qemant identity has resurfaced.https://www.ethiopia-insight.com/2018/12/16/violent-qemant- dispute-fueling-explosive-amhara-tigray-divide/ See also *Beta Israel *Jews and Judaism in Africa References =Further reading= * Gamst, Frederic C.

Early career Collier was born in 1848 in a Georgia village that would later be known as Gate City.Mellus, 1900 He was the son of Judge John J. Collier and Henrietta E. Wilson. At the age of 18, he entered into the University of Georgia to study law. While there, he joined Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Collier graduated from the University of Georgia in 1869 with a degree in law and was admitted to the bar in 1871. Shortly after, he left the law profession and went into mercantile pursuits and banking. Piedmont Exposition He was elected to the Board of Aldermen of Atlanta in 1887 and 1888, similar to the Atlanta City Council today. In 1887, he was also the President of the Piedmont Exposition which bought of land to form Piedmont Park and the Gentleman's Driving Club. In just 104 days, Collier and the rest of the Company managed to build the structures and prepare the grounds for the Exposition held at the newly named Piedmont Park. President Grover Cleveland honored Atlanta with a visit to the Exposition with his new bride, Frances Folsom. Afterwards, Collier was named President of the Cotton States and International Exposition Company charged with planning the 1895 World's Fair which at the time was known as the Cotton States and International Exposition. From 1892 to 1896 he was a member of the Fulton County Commission and with Hoke Smith provided funding for the Seaboard Air Line Railroad's construction through Georgia. The 1895 Cotton States and International Exposition (1895) Serious preparations for the Exposition began in 1894. On October 16, 1894, Collier and John Randolph Lewis wrote to Booker T. Washington making him the Chief Commissioner of the State of Alabama for the Exposition and charging him with creating an exhibit show casing the talents of African-Americans in Alabama. During the Exposition, Collier named several days of honor. One of these days included Sigma Alpha Epsilon day, where he addressed fellow SAE fraternity brothers in the auditorium. Mayor Collier was elected as Mayor of Atlanta for the first time from 1897 to 1898. In 1899, Collier was elected mayor again, pro tem. Just a year after leaving office he was accidentally shot and killed while searching for a burglar in his backyard in the early morning of September 28, 1900. He was buried in Atlanta's Oakland Cemetery. His wife, Suzie (died 1897) was the daughter of William A. Rawson. His son John Collier Sr. was commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs from 1933 to 1945 and known for his effort to reform the BIA with the Indian New Deal. His daughter Julia Collier Harris was a writer and journalist who won a 1926 Pulitzer Prize, the first to go to a Georgian. Notes References  *Mellus, Edward (Ed.)

It is the only member of the genus Stigmochelys, although in the past it was commonly placed in Geochelone. This tortoise is a grazing species that favors semi-arid, thorny to grassland habitats. In both very hot and very cold weather they may dwell in abandoned fox, jackal, or aardvark holes. Leopard tortoises do not dig other than to make nests in which to lay eggs. Given its propensity for grassland habitats, it grazes extensively upon mixed grasses. It also favors succulents and thistles. Taxonomy and etymology The phylogenic placement of the leopard tortoise has been subject to several revisions. Different authors have placed it in Geochelone (1957), Stigmochelys (2001), Centrochelys (2002), and Psammobates (2006). More recently, consensus appears to have settled on Stigmochelys, a monotypic genus.Turtle Taxonomy Working Group (2014)Baker (2015) There has been considerable debate about the existence of two subspecies, S. p. pardalis and S. p. babcocki, but recent work does not support this distinction. Stigmochelys is a combination of Greek words: stigma meaning \\"mark\\" or \\"point\\"* and chelone meaning \\"tortoise\\". The specific name pardalis is from the Latin word pardus meaning \\"leopard\\" and refers to the leopard-like spots on the tortoise's shell.  Description  Shell patterns fade in mature specimens The leopard tortoise is the fourth largest species of tortoise in the world, with typical adults reaching and weighing . Adults tend to be larger in the northern and southern ends of their range, where typical specimens weigh up to and an exceptionally large tortoise may reach and weigh .Branch (2008) The carapace is high and domed with steep, almost vertical sides. Juveniles and young adults are attractively marked with black blotches, spots or even dashes and stripes on a yellow background. In mature adults the markings tend to fade to a nondescript brown or grey. The head and limbs are uniformly colored yellow, tan, or brown. Distribution and habitat Widely distributed across the arid and savanna regions of eastern and southern Africa, extending from South Sudan and Somalia, across East Africa to South Africa and Namibia. The species is generally absent from the humid forest regions of Central Africa. Over this range, the leopard tortoise occupies the most varied habitats of any African tortoise including grasslands, thorn- scrub, mesic brushland, and savannas. They can be found at altitudes ranging from sea level to .  Ecology and behavior  Leopard tortoise eating plant material. Leopard tortoise eating Leopard tortoises are herbivorous; their diet consists of a wide variety of plants including forbs, thistles, grasses, and succulents. They will sometimes gnaw on bones or even hyena feces to obtain calcium, necessary for bone development and their eggshells. Seeds will pass undigested through the gut, so the leopard tortoise plays a significant role in seed dispersal. Normally active during the day, they are less active during hot weather or during the dry season. A very long-lived animal, the leopard tortoise reaches sexual maturity between the ages of 12 and 15 years. During the mating season, males will fight over females, ramming and butting their competitors. They will trail after females for quite some distance, often ramming them into submission. When mating, the male makes grunting vocalizations. Nesting occurs between May and October when the female digs a hole and lays a clutch of 5 to 30 eggs. As many as 5‚Äì7 clutches may be laid in a single season. Incubation will take 8‚Äì15 months depending on temperature.Ernst (1989) There are numerous predators of the eggs and hatchlings including monitor lizards, snakes, jackals and crows. Adults have few natural predators but lions and hyenas have occasionally been reported preying on them.  Conservation  The leopard tortoise is a widespread species and remains common throughout most of its range. Human activities, including agricultural burning, consumption, and especially commercial exploitation in the pet trade, are potential threats but have not yet caused significant population declines. They are increasingly being bred in captivity for the pet trade. For example, most tortoises exported from Kenya and Tanzania originate in captive breeding programs, alleviating collection from the wild. The leopard tortoise has been listed in Appendix II of CITES since 1975 and in 2000, the United States banned their import because of the risk posed by heartwater, an infectious disease carried by tortoise ticks that could seriously impact the US livestock industry.

Born in Edgefield, South Carolina, he later moved to Mississippi and represented Hinds County in the state legislature from 1859 to 1861. He was the only child of Henry Mims and Susan Burr Read of Edgefield, South Carolina. During the United States Civil War, Major Mims served with the Confederate States Army under General John C. Pemberton and saw action in the Battle of Jackson, Champion Hill and Vicksburg Campaign. He served on the staffs of John C. Pemberton and Joseph E. Johnston and shared friendship with Johnson along with continued business interests until Johnson's death in 1891. After the war, he became southern manager of the New York Life Insurance Company (since 1868) and he was charter member and served 20 years as president of the Capital City Club, where he entertained notables such as President Grover Cleveland. Following his death in 1906, he was buried in Westview Cemetery. In observance of his death, Atlanta's City Hall was closed for one half day, and free carriage rides were offered from City Hall to the Westview Cemetery. Politically he was an old school Democrat and he was elected mayor of Atlanta in October 1900. The election came in the midst of Atlanta's streetcar war; he was supported by Joel Hurt (Atlanta Consolidated Street Railway Company) and opposed by Henry M. Atkinson (Georgia Electric Light Company). On October 9, 1901 he rode in the inaugural streetcar over the Peachtree-Whitehall viaductbefore then it was a dangerous at-grade crossing of many busy railroad tracks. His two-story residence was on the northeast corner of Peachtree St and Ponce de Leon Avenue (current location of the Georgian Terrace Hotel).

Early years and education A native of Warsaw, Georgia (located in what is now northern Fulton County), born to Atlanta pioneer Clark Howell, Sr., he became a runner and pupil of Atlanta's first telegraph operator, D.U. Sloan, at the age of twelve. In 1855 he attended Georgia Military Institute in Marietta. He read law in Sandersville, and briefly practiced law in Atlanta before the outbreak of war. Military service In 1861, he joined the infantry, enlisting in Georgia's First Regiment.History of Atlanta, Georgia, Part II, page 71., Book published 1889. Within 2 years, Howell was promoted to first lieutenant. He fought under Stonewall Jackson in Virginia, and then was sent west, where he fought in the Battle of Chickamauga and the Atlanta Campaign, in which he defended the city as a captain of artillery.Nixon, Raymond B., Henry W. Grady: Spokesman of the New South, Knopf, 1943, p.128 He ended the war in Hardee's Corps as captain of Howell's Battery, Georgia Light Artillery. Business and political career Upon his return, he farmed for two years, clearing and selling lumber on his father's land near Atlanta. Then for a year he was a reporter, then city editor, of Atlanta's Daily Intelligencer. In 1869 he returned to practicing law and served in a number of political positions including member of city council, member of the state Senate, and solicitor-general of the Atlanta circuit. One of his law clients was The Constitution where he learned E.Y. Clarke was willing to sell his one half interest in the paper. In 1876 Howell purchased the 50% interest in The Atlanta Constitution and became its editor-in-chief. For the next 25 years, the paper was owned by Howell and the managing partner, William Hemphill. Both Hemphill, and later Howell, would go on to serve as Mayor of Atlanta. With Richard Peters, Samuel M. Inman, Lemuel Grant, and James W. English, he purchased the buildings on the site of the International Cotton Exposition of 1881 and made it the Exposition Cotton Mills, which were successful for many years. While editor of the Constitution in 1895, he sent out transcripts of Booker T. Washington's separate as the fingers speech across the country.

It takes a novelistic approach, focusing on characters and the daily issues that they face. Background √Ösne Seierstad entered Afghanistan two weeks after the September 11 attacks and followed the Northern Alliance into Kabul where she spent three months. Disguising herself by wearing a burka, she lived with a bookseller and his family in Kabul which provided her with a unique opportunity to describe life as ordinary Afghan citizens saw it. Themes As well as giving a historical account of events in Afghanistan as democracy is established, Seierstad focuses on the conditions of Afghan women who still live very much under the domination of men‚ÄîAfghan traditions allow for polygamy and arranged marriage. She also addresses the conflict between westernization and traditional Islam, and gives an accessible account of Afghanistan's complex recent history under the rule of the USSR, the Taliban and coalition-supported democracy. Controversy  Following global critical acclaim, many of the book's descriptions were contested by Rais, whose second wife Suraia sued the author in Norway for defamation. On July 24, 2010, Seierstad was found guilty of defamation and ‚Äúnegligent journalistic practices and ordered to pay damages to Suraia Rais, wife of Shah Muhammad Rais‚Äù... Seierstad won an appeal which overturned the previous ruling and cleared the author and her publisher, Cappelen Damm, of invading the privacy of the Rais family, and concluded that the facts of the book were accurate.. Effect on the Rais Family During a trip to Scandinavia in November 2005, Rais declared he was seeking asylum in either Norway or Sweden, as a political refugee. He felt things revealed about him in Seierstad's book had made life for him and his family unsafe in Afghanistan, where bootleg versions of the book had been published in Persian.

She was the segment's consumer affairs reporter who, like an earlier Radner character Emily Litella, editorialized on current issues, only to go off-topic before being interrupted by the anchor. Unlike Litella's meek and apologetic character, Roseannadanna was brash and tactless. The character was based on Rose Ann Scamardella, a former anchorwoman on WABC-TV's Eyewitness News in New York City. The character also appeared later in Radner's live one-woman shows.  Routine  Radner as Roseanne Roseannadanna in 1980 Roseannadanna's Saturday Night Live commentary followed a strict formula. She usually read a letter from Richard Feder of Fort Lee, New Jersey, although she once read a letter from his wife, \\"Mrs.\\" Richard Feder. The letter would include a series of questions, usually about a current social issue, to which Roseannadanna made derogatory comments about New Jersey before moving on to respond to the question. The name Richard Feder was an in-joke; it was the name of an actual resident of Fort Lee who also happened to be the brother-in-law of SNL writer and segment co-creator Alan Zweibel. The ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù Feder moved to Mount St. Helens, Washington, while the real Feder moved to West Nyack, New York, but later moved back to New Jersey, settling in Hamburg. While answering the questions, Roseannadanna invariably digressed, launching into lengthy anecdotes, frequently having to do with an encounter with celebrities (Bo Derek, Dr. Joyce Brothers, Princess Grace, Gloria Vanderbilt, etc.) which had no relevance to the topic at hand. Invariably, the story led to Roseannadanna going into graphic detail about bodily functions or personal hygiene. The concept was that the celebrities had told her the graphic stories and she was simply relating them to the audience. She also provided response to these stories, which was the rhetorical question and catch phrase: \\"What are ya tryin' to do, make me sick?!\\" Eventually, Weekend Update co-anchor Jane Curtin would interrupt, saying, \\"Roseanne, you're making me sick.\\" Curtin would then ask Roseannadanna what her comments had to do with the question. Radner would reply: \\"Well, Jane, it just goes to show you, it's always something ‚Äî if it‚Äôs not one thing, it's another.\\" Roseannadanna's comments wrapped up with the sharing of a piece of advice passed along by a family member, most often her father, but sometimes her \\"Nana Roseannadanna\\". In one episode, she mentioned her aunt \\"Pollyanna Roseannadanna\\", while in others, her \\"musically happening cousin Carlos Santana Roseannadanna\\", her religious aunt \\"Hosanna Roseannadanna\\", and her singing cousin \\"Lola Falana Roseannadanna\\". In the final episode in which the character appeared, she mentioned her fashion designer aunt, \\"Murjani Roseannadanni\\". Characterization Radner's character had a tendency to refer to herself by her full name whenever possible: \\"Mr. Feder, I know what you're talkin' about, because, I, Roseanne Roseannadanna, once had the same thing happen to me.\\" She often exaggerated her tribulations, saying: \\"I thought I was gonna die!\\" For example, she narrated a story about eating a hamburger in a restaurant and feeling something hard in it. She spat it out and found it was white and looked like a toenail, and she said: \\"I thought I was gonna die. I mean, what was a toenail doing in my hamburger?\\". Then she went to the restroom and, on the way, she saw Princess Lee Radziwill whom she described as the: \\"classy lady that no one knows where she's the princess of.\\" However, what the Princess didn't know was that she had a tiny piece of toilet paper hanging off her shoe, and she was walking around and the toilet paper hadn't fallen off. \\"I thought I was gonna be sick. So I said to her, 'Hey Princess Lee ‚Äî what are ya tryin' to do, make me sick?'. Jane Curtin then asked her what this had to do with anything, and Roseannadanna replied: \\"Well it just goes to show you, it's always something, you either got a toenail in your hamburger or toilet paper clinging to your shoe.\\" After Saturday Night Live In Radner's off- Broadway one-woman show, she included a sketch where Roseanadanna is invited to give the commencement speech at Columbia University. After disclosing that she had not been the first choice for the commencement speech, and that the university only called her after Geraldo Rivera pulled out because he \\"had a boil that needed to be lanced\\", she attempts to prepare the new graduates for the hard road ahead by describing a job interview she once had with CBS, in which Walter Cronkite mistakenly thought that she'd \\"passed gas\\" and consequently kicked her out of his office. Roseannadanna was later credited as \\"co-author\\" of Radner's book Roseanne Roseannadanna's Hey Get Back to Work. In the last year of her life, Radner released a memoir of her experience with ovarian cancer, entitled It's Always Something. Radner also recorded the memoir as an audio book, imitating Roseannadanna and some of her other SNL characters when describing parts of her life.

The term may apply specifically to a dissector tube employing magnetic fields to keep the electron image in focus, and an electron multiplier to scan the electrons.Horowitz, Paul and Winfield Hill, The Art of Electronics, Second Edition, Cambridge University Press, 1989, pp. 1000-1001. . Dissectors were used only briefly in television systems before being replaced by the much more sensitive iconoscope during the 1930s. Operation An image dissector focuses a visual image onto a layer of photosensitive material, such as caesium oxide, which emits negatively charged \\"photoelectrons\\" proportional to the intensity of the light striking the material. Electrostatic deflecting plates or magnetic fields then periodically manipulate the resulting electron image horizontally and vertically before an electron multiplier, or a small aperture leading to a positively charged detector, or anode, in the case of the earliest dissector tubes. The electron multiplier or aperture permits only those electrons emanating from a very small area of the electron image, representing a similarly small area of the visual image. The entire image is scanned several times per second to produce an electrical signal suitably representative of a moving visual image. Because the dissector does not store charge, it is useful for viewing the inside of furnaces and monitoring welding systems as it does not suffer from the \\"flare\\" normal picture tubes experience when looking at intense lights. History In April 1925, German professor Max Dieckmann and his student Rudolf Hell applied for a patent for a device named Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerr√∂hre f√ºr Fernseher (Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television). A patent was issued in October 1927, and their experiments were announced in the magazines Discovery and Popular Radio, but they failed to reduce it to practice. In 1951, Hell claimed that he had made a tube but could not get it to function, since at the time there was an insufficient knowledge of electron optics, the manipulation of an electron beam by electric or magnetic fields. American television pioneer Philo T. Farnsworth invented the first functional image dissector in 1927, submitting a patent application on January 7, 1927.Farnsworth, Philo T., Television System. Patent No. 1,773,980, U. S. Patent Office, filed 1927-01-07, issued 1930-04-26. Retrieved 2010-03-12. On September 7 of that year, the image dissector successfully transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, at Farnsworth's laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco.Postman, Neil, \\"Philo Farnsworth\\", The TIME 100: Scientists & Thinkers, TIME.com, 1999-03-29, retrieved 2009-07-28.\\"Philo Taylor Farnsworth (1906-1971)\\" , The Virtual Museum of the City of San Francisco, retrieved 2009-07-15. By September 3, 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press, the first such successful demonstration of a fully electronic television system. In 1929 Farnsworth eliminated a motor generator from the system, so it then had no mechanical parts. Further developments that year included improvements in image clarity and an increase in the number of lines of resolution, such that it exceeded that of the mechanical television systems.Abramson, Albert, Zworykin, Pioneer of Television, p. 226. Also in 1929, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma (\\"Pem\\") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).The Philo T. and Elma G.

Since the electrons emitted within an image dissector are collected by the electron multiplier or anode only during the very brief time an area of the \\"electron image\\" is exposed, the bulk of the electrons are lost. Thus the earliest image dissectors were very inefficient, and extremely bright illumination was required for it to be used effectively. Farnsworth addressed this problem with the invention of an \\"electron multiplier\\" (not to be confused with contemporary electron multipliers), a device that increased the number of electrons in a circuit by generating \\"secondary emissions\\" of electrons from a pair of opposed surfaces, thus amplifying the electrical signal.Farnsworth, Philo T., Electron Multiplier.

A significant problem with the multipactor, however, was that it wore out at an unsatisfactorily rapid rate. On August 25, 1934, Farnsworth gave the world's first public demonstration of a complete, all-electronic television system, which included his image dissector, at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\\"New Television System Uses 'Magnetic Lens'\\", Popular Mechanics, Dec. 1934, p. 838‚Äì839.Burns, R.

He batted and threw left-handed. Early life Randy Myers grew up in Vancouver, Washington. His father was an auto mechanic and a machinist. He is a graduate of Evergreen High School and Clark College. Myers was drafted in the first round (ninth overall) of the 1982 amateur draft. Professional career Myers began his Major League career with the New York Mets in 1985 under the management of Davey Johnson, and was a member of the Mets 1986 World Series-winning team (although he did not appear on the Mets' postseason roster then, he was given a belated World Series ring nine years later in 1995). Myers became a closer in 1988 as he platooned with Roger McDowell after Jesse Orosco left for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Myers was traded to the Reds in 1990 for closer John Franco, and became one of the league's elite closers and the most successful member of the Nasty Boys trio, which also included Rob Dibble and Norm Charlton, while being selected as an All-Star in 1990. In 1990 Myers won his second World Series ring as the Reds swept the Oakland Athletics. In 1991, the Reds experimented with Myers as a starter, a move that proved highly unsuccessful as he posted a record of 6 wins and 13 losses. In 1992, Myers became the closer for the Padres. After only one season in San Diego, Myers was a Cub in 1993 where he posted his best statistical season with a then National League record 53 saves. In a September 28, 1995 game vs. the Astros, Myers was attacked by a fan at Wrigley Field after giving up a home run. In 1994 and 1995, Myers earned his second and third All-Star selections. After the 1995 season, Myers became a member of the Orioles where he had two more solid seasons, highlighted by an All-Star selection in 1997, when he saved 45 games. Myers had 28 saves for the Blue Jays in his final season, 1998, before being traded back to the Padres after being claimed on waivers. Though he was under contract for both 1999 and 2000, he did not pitch in the Major Leagues after 1998. In a 14-year Major League career, Myers compiled a 3.19 ERA, 347 saves, 44 wins, 63 losses and struck out 884 batters in 884.2 innings. As of the end of the 2019 Major League Baseball season, Myers ranks 12th all-time in saves, and is a member of the 300 save club. In 2000, Myers earned a salary of US$6,916,667.00 while unable to pitch due to a damaged shoulder. Most of his 1999 and 2000 seasons were spent receiving treatment after undergoing rotator cuff surgery in 1999; his injury resulted in a legal dispute between the Padres and their insurance carrier after the carrier denied an $8 million claim due to Myers' inability to play. The Padres' 1998 waiver claim of Myers is considered one of the biggest blunders in the history of the waiver wire. The Padres did not want Myers, mostly because of the $12 million and two additional years remaining on his contract as well as the fact that they already had an established closer in Trevor Hoffman, but placed a waiver claim in order to prevent him from going to the rival Atlanta Braves. They expected the Blue Jays to rescind their waiver claim, but the Blue Jays instead allowed the waiver claim to go through, leaving them responsible for the rest of his contract. In October 1990, Myers was featured on the 18-ounce box of Wheaties breakfast cereal along with fellow Cincinnati Reds 1990 World Series champions Eric Davis, Jos√© Rijo, Barry Larkin, Chris Sabo, and Hal Morris. Personal life For many years during his pro baseball career he assisted in coaching the women's basketball team at his alma mater, Clark Community College. He is widely involved in charities in Vancouver through his Randy Myers Foundation. He also has a lifelong involvement in martial arts. Clark College did not field a baseball team after the 1992 season, but by 2011, thanks in large part of Myers' efforts fundraising and spearheading the program's revival, Clark again started playing baseball in 2011.

Created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane, the character first appeared in Detective Comics #33 (November 1939). In Batman's origin story, Joe Chill is the Gotham City mugger who murders young Bruce Wayne's parents, Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne. The murder traumatizes Bruce, inspiring his vow to avenge their deaths by fighting crime as the vigilante Batman. Publication history Joe Chill first appears in Detective Comics #33 and was created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane. Fictional character biography Not much is known about Chill except that he is, in most versions of Batman, a petty mugger who kills Bruce's parents Thomas and Martha while trying to take their money and jewelry. When he demands Martha's necklace, Thomas moves to protect his wife and Chill panics and shoots him; he then kills Martha when she screams for help (in later versions up to the 1970s, Martha dies from a heart attack brought on from the shock of seeing her husband murdered). Chill runs away when Bruce begins crying and calling for help  but not before the boy memorizes his features. In at least three versions of the Batman mythos, the Waynes' killer is never identified. =Pre-Crisis version= Unnamed mugger holding the Wayne family at gunpoint in Detective Comics #33 (November 1939); art by Bob Kane Batman's origin story is first established in a sequence of panels in Detective Comics #33 (November 1939) that is later reproduced in the comic book Batman #1 (Spring 1940), but the mugger is not given a name until Batman #47 (June‚ÄìJuly 1948). In that issue, Batman discovers that Joe Chill, the small-time crime boss he is investigating, is none other than the man who killed his parents. Batman confronts him with the knowledge that Chill killed Thomas and Martha Wayne. Chill, believing there is no way Batman could know this, accuses him of bluffing, but Batman reveals his secret identity quoting \\"I know because I am the son of the man you murdered! I am Bruce Wayne!!\\" Terrified, Chill flees and seeks protection from his henchmen. Once his henchmen learn that Chill's actions led to the hated Batman's existence, however, they turn on their boss and gun him down before suddenly realizing how priceless his knowledge of Batman's true identity is. Before the dying Chill has a chance to reveal Batman's identity, the Dark Knight intervenes and knocks out the goons. Chill expires in Batman's arms, acknowledging that the Dark Knight got his revenge after all. Len Wein and John Byrne add a one-panel coda in their retelling of this scene in the first issue of The Untold Legend of the Batman. Batman stands over Chill's body and says \\"No, Chill  The Batman didn't finish you... It was Bruce Wayne!\\" In Detective Comics #235 (1956), Batman learns that Chill was not a mere mugger, but actually a hitman who murdered the Waynes on orders from a mob boss named Lew Moxon. Batman also deduced that was why he himself was left unharmed by Chill: so he would unwittingly support Moxon's alibi that he had nothing to do with a robbery that was really a planned murder. In The Brave and the Bold #79 (Sep. 1968), Joe Chill is revealed to have a brother named Max who is also a criminal. Max Chill is suspected of having murdered Boston Brand (AKA Deadman), though the suspicion proves erroneous. Max is killed when a stack of slot machines falls onto him. In Batman #208 (Jan./Feb. 1969), it is revealed that both Joe and Max had changed their name to Chill from Chilton and that their mother was the housekeeper to Bruce Wayne's uncle Philip Wayne, who became Bruce's primary guardian after his parents' deaths. As he was often away on business, Mrs. Chilton played the primary parental role in the boy's life. As an adult, Bruce continues to visit the elderly woman, whom he still calls \\"Mom Chilton\\". He is unaware of her connection with Joe and Max Chill. For her part, Mrs. Chilton knows Bruce is secretly Batman and is proud of him. She is also aware that her sons died fighting him, and she still mourns their deaths. (Perhaps because they were both domestic servants, Alfred, the adult Bruce's butler, was secretly aware of Mrs. Chilton's connection, but he kept that information from Bruce. He once mused that \\"in her own way, that dear woman more than made up for her son's heinous crime\\".) =Modern Age version= In the 1987 storyline Batman: Year Two, Chill played a key role. Several Gotham City crime bosses pool their resources to deal with a lethal vigilante called the Reaper, and Chill, an experienced button man, is hired to take him out. When Batman proposes an alliance with the bosses, they agree that he and Chill will work together  something Batman finds repugnant, but which he nevertheless justifies to himself as necessary to tackle the Reaper. He vows to kill Chill afterwards. Chill is also secretly commissioned to kill Batman after the Reaper has been disposed of. During a major confrontation, the crime bosses are all killed in a shootout at a warehouse, in which the Reaper seemingly also perishes. Chill reasons that he has no reason to fulfill his contract, but Batman takes him to \\"Crime Alley\\", the scene of his parents' murder. There he confronts Chill and reveals his identity. Batman has Chill at gunpoint, but the Reaper then appears and guns Chill down. It is left ambiguous as to whether or not Batman would have actually pulled the trigger. In the 1991 sequel to \\"Year Two\\", Batman: Full Circle, Chill's son, Joe Chill, Jr. assumes the identity of the Reaper in order to seek revenge for his father's death. He attempts to drive Batman insane by using hallucinogenic drugs in conjunction with a faked video of the Waynes' murder to trigger Batman's survivor's guilt over his parents' death and thus break his will. After the intervention of Robin, Batman frees himself from the drug-induced haze. After the new Reaper is defeated, Batman learns to let go of his hatred of Chill. In Detective Comics #678, a \\"Zero Hour\\" crossover story, Batman finds himself in an alternate timeline where, instead of his parents, he was killed by a mugger. Investigating the crime, he discovers that Chill, at least in this timeline, did not commit the murder. Once he returns to his own timeline, Bruce Wayne is plagued with doubt. He wonders if there's a possibility that he never actually caught or confronted his parents' killer. He also wonders if that makes any difference regarding his crimefighting career. Ultimately, he concludes that it does not. In 2006, Infinite Crisis #6 reestablished that Chill was responsible for shooting Thomas and Martha Wayne, and that he was later arrested on that same night for their murder. In the 2008 Grant Morrison story \\"Joe Chill in Hell\\" (featured in Batman #673), Chill is reinterpreted as a mid-level crime boss who builds the Land, Sea, and Air Transport company from the ground up (most likely through illegal means). He blames his crimes, including murdering the Waynes, on class warfare that forced him to do things he wouldn't have otherwise. In this story, Batman has visited and frightened Chill every night for a month. Chill is living as a shut-in, but his guards never see or catch Batman during the visits. On his final visit, Batman gives Chill the gun he used to kill the Waynes, with a single bullet loaded in it. Chill finally realizes who Batman is and fears what his fellow gangsters might do if they found out he was responsible for creating him. It is implied that he uses his gun to commit suicide. Considering the issue consists of Bruce's flashbacks and hallucinations from an experiment he undergoes during his early career, however, it is left ambiguous whether the events of the story are real. In 2009's Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader? by Neil Gaiman, Joe Chill is seen as the bartender attending Batman's funeral (the funeral itself being a near death experience). Batman, who is observing the event as well as Catwoman, note that Joe Chill should be dead. Chill notes that he was there at the birth of Batman and it is only fitting he should be there to witness the end. =The New 52= In The New 52, the 2011 reboot of DC Comics' primary continuity, an 18-year-old Bruce Wayne tracks Chill down and holds him at gunpoint, demanding to know who hired him to kill his parents. Chill responds that he just wanted Martha Wayne's pearls so he could buy alcohol and that he didn't even know who the Waynes were until the next day. Enraged that Chill killed his parents for no good reason, Bruce prepares to kill him, but relents at the last minute when he realizes that his father would not have wanted that. After sparing Chill's life, Bruce Wayne leaves Gotham City and begins training to fight crime, vowing that he will make sure what Chill did never happens to anyone else. =Post-Rebirth= In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called DC Rebirth, which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to The New 52. In the 2020 miniseries Batman: Three Jokers, a news report about the massacre of the final members of the Moxon Crime Family stated that they were accused of hiring Joe Chill to kill Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne only for them to be exonerated when Joe Chill confessed that he acted alone. It was also mentioned that Joe Chill is serving a life sentence at Blackgate Penitentiary.Batman: Three Jokers #1. DC Comics. Using the fingerprints from Judge Wade Walls' humanitarian trophy, Batman enters Blackgate Penitentiary to see Joe Chill. When Batman finds that he is not in his cell, Batgirl informs Batman that Joe Chill was moved to the infirmary where he is suffering from stage 4 cancer. The two Jokers later abduct Joe Chill from the infirmary where they put his hat on him and want him to confess on camera as one of the Jokers asks \\"Why did you really kill Thomas and Martha Wayne?\\"Batman: Three Jokers #2. DC Comics. Other versions In Frank Miller's 1986 limited series Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Bruce Wayne finally resolves his feelings towards Chill (who is not named). While about to be mugged by street punks, Bruce initially fantasizes that the two amateur criminals are both Joe Chill, so he can take out his rage on them. They leave him alone, however, after realizing he would have fought them : \\"Look at him. He's into it. No fun when they're into it\\". Bruce realizes that Chill had not killed his parents for killing's sake, as the two punks wanted to do to him, and thus was not truly evil. \\"All he wanted was money\\", he thinks to himself. \\"He was sick and guilty over what he did. I was na√Øve enough to think him the lowest sort of man\\". In the comics featuring the Crime Syndicate of America, it is revealed that on the Syndicate's alternate Earth, Joe Chill was a friend of Dr. Thomas Wayne. One night, a police officer wants to bring the elder Wayne in for questioning. When he refuses, the police officer suddenly opens fire. This Earth's version of Bruce Wayne and Martha Wayne are killed. Chill comes out of an alleyway to discover the dead bodies and the Waynes' younger son Thomas Wayne Jr., leaves with him, blaming his father for his mother and brother's deaths, and seeing Chill as the only father figure he has left. In the alternate universe of Flashpoint, Joe Chill shoots and kills the young Bruce Wayne, and Thomas Wayne seeks to kill him to avenge his son. He locates Chill and attempts to inject him with a drug, but instead beats him to death in a vengeful fury. Afterwards, Thomas puts Chill's gun in a trophy display in the Batcave. Joe Chill is featured in many Elseworld titles, including Superman: Speeding Bullets, Citizen Wayne, Batman: In Darkest Knight, Batman: Holy Terror, Batman of Arkham, JLA: Destiny, and Dark Knight Dynasty. Joe Chill is featured in the comic book continuation of the television series Smallville, albeit with no connection to Batman. Instead, he worked as an Intergang contact before being killed by Mr. Freeze.Smallville Season 11 vol. 1 #5-8 (September‚ÄìDecember 2012) Joe Chill appears in The Batman Adventures #17, which is set in the continuity of Batman: The Animated Series and its DCAU spinoffs. In a story by Ty Templeton entitled \\"Fear Itself\\", Chill is shown to have spent his whole life as a career criminal since the night he murdered Bruce's parents. The story begins with Chill being released from prison after finishing a sentence for an unrelated crime, and it is apparent that he has been living in fear since that fateful night. Chill is convinced that Bruce Wayne, now one of the most powerful men on the planet, is biding his time to exact revenge. Chill's paranoia is so severe that he begins to see Bruce's face everywhere around him, even on other people. His paranoia goes into overdrive when he discovers that the retired police detective who originally worked on the Wayne case has finally discovered evidence that he was the killer. Chill tracks the detective to his apartment and attempts to silence him, but Batman intervenes, unaware of who Chill is. In a brief scuffle Chill manages to unmask Batman, revealing the visage of Bruce Wayne. Terrified, Chill falls off a balcony, and Batman jumps after him in an attempt to save his life. Batman nearly catches Chill, who pushes him away in terror and falls to his death. Batman is left at the end of the story wondering who the mysterious man was and why he would rather die than accept his help. In Batman Beyond Unlimited set in the DC Animated Universe, Chill is revealed to have a brother. Chill's grandnephew eventually has a child of his own, Jake. In the continuity, Jake Chill is a former security guard at Wayne-Powers, working under Derek Powers' \\"Quiet Squad\\". Having killed Warren McGinnis under Mr. Fixx's orders, Jake repeats his great- granduncle's history with the Waynes and indirectly creates another Batman. Though no one discovers his involvement with McGinnis' murder, Jake Chill is wracked with guilt and decides to become a vigilante to redeem his family's sins.Batman Beyond Unlimited #5 (June 2012) Jake takes the name Vigilante, modified the uniform he got from his former employer as his costume, and works with Batman to stop a riot led by the Jokerz.Batman Beyond Unlimited #8 (September 2012) He is eventually killed in the \\"Mark of the Phantasm\\" storyline, where he suffers a seizure after being injected with Joker Toxin and inhaling the Phantasm's fear gas. Though Terry lashed out at Jake after discovering Jake killed his father, he ultimately respected Jake as a hero and regretted that he died the way he did. In Andrew Vachss' novel Batman: The Ultimate Evil, Chill (who is never seen) is revealed to have killed Bruce Wayne's parents on the orders of an international ring of pedophiles. They wanted to silence Bruce's mother Martha, who was investigating their network of sexual slavery and child pornography. On the alternate world of Earth-Two as part of The New 52, Joe Chill is a hired assassin who shoots Thomas and Martha Wayne. Chill is later killed when Thomas Wayne (who had survived the shooting) crushes his skull in retaliation for Martha's death.Earth 2 Annual #2 In the prequel comic to Justice League: Gods and Monsters, Joe Chill is the right-hand man of crime lord Lew Moxon. When Batman corners them during a meeting with the other crimelords, he kills Lew Moxon and drinks Joe Chill's blood. Upon becoming a vampire, Joe Chill later kills Lew Moxon's wife Angela. Batman avenges her death by killing Chill with an axe. In other media =Television= * In the Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians episode \\"The Fear\\", a flashback depicts Thomas and Martha Wayne being mugged by someone who might be Joe Chill (voiced by Michael Rye). When his father tries to fight him, a young Bruce says, \\"No Dad, he's got a...\\" and lightning is shown in the sky as his parents are shot offscreen. This flashback is later induced by the Scarecrow. This episode represents the first time that Batman's origin is portrayed on television. * The Justice League Unlimited episode \\"For the Man Who Has Everything\\" features an appearance by Joe Chill, voiced by Kevin Conroy (the voice of Batman in the DC animated universe). In the episode, Batman is captured by the Black Mercy plant, which traps its prey in the fantasy of their heart's desire. While under the plant's spell, Batman hallucinates that his father beats Chill up after disarming him. When Wonder Woman tears the plant off of Batman, however, the vision returns to reality, with Chill shooting and killing Bruce's parents offscreen. * Joe Chill is the main focus in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Chill of the Night!\\", voiced by Peter Onorati. This version of the character is a hitman who kills Thomas and Martha on orders from his boss Lew Moxon as revenge for Thomas Wayne putting him in jail. In the present day, Moxon is dying and confesses to a priest (Batman in disguise) that Joe Chill is now working as an arms dealer who sells weapons to super-criminals on the black market, auctioning a sonic weapon to Gotham City‚Äôs supervillains (consisting of Joker, Mad Hatter, Mr. Freeze, Penguin, Poison Ivy, Solomon Grundy, and Two-Face). Batman confronts him and reveals his secret identity. Terrified, Chill asks the villains for help. When he acknowledges that he is indirectly responsible for Batman‚Äôs existence, the villains turn on him. Batman stops the villains from killing Chill, but Spectre manipulates events so that Chill dies when Batman redirects the blast of the weapon Chill was selling, causing the roof to collapse on him. This episode marked the first time in the history of animation that Batman confronts the killer of his parents. * In the series premiere of Gotham, a masked mugger (Danny Schoch) kills Thomas and Martha Wayne in front of their son, Bruce (David Mazouz). In a departure from the comics, however, the series ultimately reveals that, instead of Chill, small- time hitman Patrick ‚ÄúMatches‚Äù Malone (Michael Bowen) killed the Waynes on orders from his employer, Hugo Strange (B.D. Wong). =Film= * In the original script for 1989's Batman, crime boss Rupert Thorne hires Joe Chill to murder Thomas Wayne due to the latter running against Thorne for city council. In the final version of the film, however, Jack Napier (who would later become the Joker) is Thomas and Martha's killer. According to producer Michael Uslan, Chill is one of Napier's minions who accompanied him in mugging the Waynes and was credited as \\"Other Mugger\\" (portrayed by Clyde Gatell).Comics Interview #77, Michael Uslan and Benjamin Melniker After Jack Napier shot Thomas and Martha Wayne from his position, he was about to shoot Bruce only for Joe to advise him to flee the area before the police shows up. * Joe Chill appears in Batman Begins, portrayed by Richard Brake. This version of Chill claims to have resorted to mugging the Waynes because he was one of the millions of Gothamites struggling with poverty amid an economic depression plaguing the city at the time (later revealed to have been caused by the League of Shadows). When Chill grabs Martha‚Äôs necklace, Thomas moves to defend her, and a panicked Chill shoots them both dead. He is arrested that night, and sentenced to prison. After serving fourteen years, Chill makes a deal to finally get parole in return for testifying against his cellmate, mob boss Carmine Falcone. As Chill is escorted out of the courthouse, he is shot and killed by a Falcone-employed assassin posing as a reporter, depriving Bruce of his own chance for revenge, as Bruce had a gun in his own hand and was standing by to kill him himself. When Bruce confronts Falcone, the gangster taunts him by saying that Chill bragged to him that Thomas Wayne \\"begged like a dog\\" for his life. Later on in the film, Batman relives his parents' murder under the influence of the Scarecrow's fear toxin. * Joe Chill appears briefly in the 2016 film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, portrayed by an uncredited Damon Caro. He is the unnamed killer featured during the opening credits and a flashback later on, both of which show him killing the Waynes. * Near the end of the 2019 film Joker, Thomas, Martha, and Bruce Wayne are confronted by a rioter (portrayed by an unknown extra) in an alley wearing a clown mask who is presumably Joe Chill. Inspired by Joker's killing of variety show host Murray Franklin on live television, he proceeds to fatally shoot Thomas and Martha, declaring that they are getting what they deserve. * Joe Chill appears in a flashback of Justice League Dark: Apokolips War. =Video games= * Joe Chill is referenced in Batman: Arkham Asylum. Batman, during a scene when he is under the influence of the Scarecrow's fear gas, relives his parents' murder. In the hallucination, Joe Chill's voice is distorted and the person providing the voice was uncredited. * Joe Chill appears in Batman: The Telltale Series, voiced by Jarion Monroe. In the game, it is revealed that Chill worked as a hitman for Carmine Falcone and murdered Thomas and Martha on behalf of Falcone's ally, Mayor Hamilton Hill. He was later imprisoned for his crime and stabbed to death by a fellow inmate hired by Hill to keep him quiet. * The opening of Batman: Arkham VR has the player witness Joe Chill (voiced by Glenn Wrage) killing Bruce's parents, marking the only time where Joe Chill is seen in the Arkham games.

The building houses the bicameral state legislature and the office of the governor. Located in Sacramento, the Neoclassical structure was completed between 1861 and 1874 at the west end of Capitol Park, which is framed by L Street to the north, N Street to the south, 10th Street to the west, and 15th Street to the east. History The structure was completed between 1861 and 1874. The Capitol and grounds were listed on the office of the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and listed as a California Historical Landmark in 1974, with a re-dedication on January 9, 1982, to commemorate the close of the bicentennial restoration project. The building had undergone a major renovation, known as the California State Capitol Restoration, from 1975 until 1982 to restore the Capitol to its former beauty and to retrofit the structure for earthquake safety. Although not generally considered earthquake country, Sacramento was hit by two earthquakes within days of each other in 1892 which damaged the Capitol.\\"More Terrestrial Chills - Sacramento Shivers Again, But Not Damaged to Any Extent\\". The Sacramento Union. April 22, 1892. p. 3. \\"The Capitol was given a lively shaking, in the course of which a small portion of one of the plaster statuettes tumbled off and the Assembly chamber ceiling cracked. Of course, there was a general exodus of State officials and clerks, too.\\" Construction and design =Exterior= The building is based on the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C. The west facade ends in projecting bays, and a portico projects from the center of the building. At the base of the portico, seven granite archways brace and support the porch above. Eight fluted Corinthian columns line the portico. A cornice supports the pediment above depicting Minerva surrounded by Education, Justice, Industry and Mining. Above the flat roof with balustrade are two drums supporting a dome. The first drum consists of a colonnade of Corinthian columns; the second, Corinthian pilasters. Large arched windows line the drum walls. The dome is high, and supports a lantern with a smaller dome capped with a gold-leafed orbed finial. =Interior= Larkin Mead's statue Columbus Before Queen Isabella, which was removed in 2020, commemorating her decision to finance a voyage to the New World The California Senate chamber seats its forty members in a large chamber room decorated in red, which is a reference to the British House of Lords, also the upper house of a bicameral legislature. The chamber is entered through a second floor corridor. From the coffered ceiling hangs an electric reproduction of the original gas chandelier. A hand-carved dais caps off a recessed bay framed by Corinthian columns. The Latin phrase \\"Senatoris est civitatis libertatem tueri\\" [\\"It is the duty of the Senator to guard the civil liberties of the Commonwealth\\"] lines the cornice. A portrait of George Washington by Jane Stuart, the daughter of Gilbert Stuart, is on the wall above. The State Seal hangs above. Statues of the Roman goddess Minerva once overlooked both chambers. Today, Minerva, sculpted by Michael H. Casey, appears only in the senate chambers. Gilded Corinthian columns support the gallery above, and dark red curtains that can be drawn for privacy are tied back along the columns. High arched windows run along the bottom below rectangular pane windows. Behind the rostrum, there are two chairs with red velvet cushions, reserved for the president pro tempore of the senate and the speaker of the assembly, but are never used. The California Assembly chamber is located at the opposite end of the building. Its green tones are based on those of the British House of Commons, the lower house. The dais rests along a wall shaped like an \\"E\\", with the central projection housing the rostrum. Along the cornice appears a quotation from Abraham Lincoln in Latin: Legislatorum est justas leges condere (\\"It is the duty of legislators to establish just laws\\"). Almost every decorating element is identical to the Senate Chamber. Capitol Park The capitol's grounds are known as Capitol Park, an area of 10 undivided city blocks running from 10th to 16th and from L to N Streets. The entire Capitol Park area is included in the National Register historic district listing. With The park is managed by the California State Capitol Museum.

The reaction generally occurs between aromatic aldehydes or glyoxals. The reaction produces an acyloin. In the classic application benzaldehyde is converted to benzoin. The benzoin condensation was first reported in 1832 by Justus von Liebig and Friedrich W√∂hler during their research on bitter almond oil. The catalytic version of the reaction involving cyanide was developed by Nikolay Zinin in the late 1830s, Benzoin addition Reaction mechanism The reaction is catalyzed by nucleophiles such as a cyanide or an N-heterocyclic carbene (usually thiazolium salts). The reaction mechanism was proposed in 1903 by A. J. Lapworth. In the first step in this reaction, the cyanide anion (as sodium cyanide) reacts with the aldehyde in a nucleophilic addition. Rearrangement of the intermediate results in polarity reversal of the carbonyl group, which then adds to the second carbonyl group in a second nucleophilic addition. Proton transfer and elimination of the cyanide ion affords benzoin as the product. This is a reversible reaction, which means that the distribution of products is determined by the relative thermodynamic stability of the products and starting material. Mechanism of the benzoin addition In this reaction, one aldehyde donates a proton and one aldehyde accepts a proton. Some aldehydes can only donate protons, such as 4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde whereas benzaldehyde is both a proton acceptor and donor. In this way it is possible to synthesise mixed benzoins, i.e. products with different groups on each half of the product. However, care should be taken to match a proton donating aldehyde with a proton accepting aldehyde to avoid undesired homo- dimerization. Scope The reaction can be extended to aliphatic aldehydes with base catalysis in the presence of thiazolium salts; the reaction mechanism is essentially the same... These compounds are important in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds. The analogous 1,4-addition of an aldehyde to an enone is called the Stetter reaction. In biochemistry, the coenzyme thiamine is responsible for biosynthesis of acyloin-like compounds utilizing the benzoin addition. This coenzyme also contains a thiazolium moiety, which on deprotonation becomes a nucleophilic carbene. The asymmetric version of this reaction has been performed by utilizing chiral thiazolium and triazolium salts. Triazolium salts were found to give greater enantiomeric excess than thiazolium salts. An example is shown below. Scheme 2. An intramolecular benzoin addition Since the products of the reaction are thermodynamically controlled, the Retro Benzoin Addition can be synthetically useful. If a benzoin or acyloin can be synthesized by another method, then they can be converted into the component ketones using cyanide or thiazolium catalysts. The reaction mechanism is the same as above, but it occurs in the reverse direction. This can allow the access of ketones otherwise difficult to produce.

With Japan in a critical state, the K-200 never reached the drawing board. There is very little data on the K-200 and contemporary illustrations of the K-200 are based on speculation. Design and development Drawing on the company's E11K1 and K-60 designs, the K-200 was to use six turbojets. The suggestion that the K-200 was intended to replace other long-range heavy flying boats in Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) service and that the K-200 was also proposed as the delivery platform to carry a Japanese nuclear weapon to the United States are not supported with evidence. The IJN may have asked Kawanishi to consider a turbojet powered flying boat or it may have been a company initiative. Support for the latter comes from the IJN's request for the Kawanishi H11K Soku and the K-60, both large flying boats, and thus the suggestion may have been put forth. For such a large flying boat, the K-200 likely would have been powered by the Ne-330 turbojet. This was the last turbojet design in progress before the war ended and which had the highest thrust rating at 1,300 kg of thrust. However, the Ne-330 consumed 1.95 kg of fuel per kg of thrust and six Ne-330 engines would have resulted in the K-200 needing to devote a large portion of its weight for fuel. A consequence of this would be a rather short operational range, inferior to the main IJN flying boat, the Kawanishi H8K \\"Emily\\", even through the speed would have been faster. This shorter range would have made the K-200 a poor candidate as an aircraft capable of reaching the U.S. to deliver an atomic weapon. The engines were mounted on top of the wing, three per wing. This position would minimize water ingestion by the engines. It is likely that the K-200 sported a weapon fit similar to the H8K. This would have consisted of a Type 99 20mm cannon in a tail turret and in a turret on the top of the fuselage, forward of the wings. Blisters on the forward port sides of the hull would have carried either the Type 99 or the Type 92 7.7mm machine-gun. Another cannon was located in the nose. The K-200 may have also been capable of carrying torpedoes, depth charges, or bombs. As a note, one such illustration of the K-200 looks much like the Russian Beriev R-1. The war ended before plans for the K-200 could be completed.

Its first issue was published in August 1999 and it ran until 2001. The magazine was launched by ex-Edge deputy editor Caspar Field, who edited the first seven issues. After his departure to launch the children's Dreamcast magazine, Mr Dreamcast, associate editor Keith Stuart took over until issue 19. At this point, then-deputy editor Lee Hart took over for the single issue that remained. History At launch, DC-UK changed the prevailing Future plc games magazine running order of the time, which went news - previews - features - reviews - tips - letters, by rearranging some of the major sections. This resulted in a running order of reviews - news - features - previews - tips - letters. The magazine also offered some additional content, such as interviews with game developers and attempts at unusual features, such as creating cocktails themed around famous Sega characters. Following Field's departure, DC-UK reverted to the standard Future plc format, which was used until the magazine's closure. The upbeat feel of the magazine, however, continued throughout every issue, and prior to being revised the title was nominated for the 1999 InDin Magazine of the Year award. Sales of DC-UK, particularly during the early months of its existence, were strong ‚Äì often coming close to those of the Official Dreamcast Magazine (UK) despite the latter selling with a cover-mounted disc featuring demo versions of games. DC-UK had in fact started life as Future Publishing's pitch for the rights to the UK Dreamcast magazine license. However, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe (SCEE), from which Future held the rights to the Official UK PlayStation Magazine, objected, leading Future to withdraw its bid for the Dreamcast deal. In March 2000 Future published the first issue of the short- lived DC-UK spin-off title DC-TIPS. Both DC-TIPS and DC-UK's sales began to suffer during early 2000 as British public interest in Dreamcast declined during the run-up to PlayStation 2's November 2000 arrival in Europe. During the magazine's run it was supported by a website at dc-uk.co.uk. This closed on 8 March 2001, shortly after the magazine's last issue had gone on sale, with the message 'Goodbye folks!'. DC-TIPS DC-TIPS was a magazine dedicated to game guides and tips for the Dreamcast and each issue was on average 128 pages long, for the price of ¬£3.99. The magazine was launched as a companion to DC-UK and the two magazines were offered to readers in a special combination subscription. Issue #1 was published in March 2000, 7 months after \\"parent\\" magazine. The magazine was cancelled before issue #4 went to press, with most of the latest issue completed. Some of the commissioned work for future issues included Star Wars: Episode I Racer and Resident Evil Code: Veronica. The magazine was launched by Will Groves who was editor for the lifetime of the magazine. Richard Owen joined as the full-time staff writer halfway through the creation of the first issue. In charge of art was Brad Merrett and the designer was Efrain Mendoza. Contributors to the magazine included Dean Mortlock, Nadine Pittam, Daniel Glenfield, Sally Meddings and Jon Billington. The colour orange was prevalent throughout the magazine, complimenting DC-UK's prevalent blue. It is worth noting that the Dreamcast logo in Europe was blue, and in the US and Japan it was orange. This made orange an obvious choice for DC-TIPS given that the design was so closely tied to its parent DC-UK. Although its run of magazines was short, DC-TIPS covered a relatively large number of games throughout its pages. The magazine would begin with a set of featured games with guides taking up between 5 (Sega Bass Fishing) and 20+ pages (MDK2). At the back of the magazine was a section named \\"Listings\\" which had tips for most games on the Dreamcast system. These tips would be between a short paragraph and six pages. The style in the Listings section was much more compact than in the front of the magazine. Some of the games featured included: * Chu Chu Rocket * Crazy Taxi * Evolution * JoJo's Bizarre Adventure * MDK2 (Cover Art) * NBA 2K * Power Stone * Rayman 2 * Resident Evil 2 * Sega Bass Fishing * Shadow Man * Slave Zero * Sonic Adventure * Soul Calibur * Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation (Cover Art) External links *DC-UK at the Internet Archive References Category:1999 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:2001 disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:Video game magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Monthly magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Defunct magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Dreamcast Category:Magazines established in 1999 Category:Magazines disestablished in 2001 ","title":"DC-UK"},{"id":"1968194","text":"Walter Arthur Sims (September 19, 1880 ‚Äì November 26, 1953) was an American politician and reputed Klansman.

He graduated from the University of Georgia in 1899 and began a twenty-five-year law career in Atlanta. In 1903, he married Edna Belle Cheshire, daughter of Napoleon Cheshire (after whom Cheshire Bridge Road is named). He served as councilman of Atlanta's Ninth Ward. He was twice elected mayor of Atlanta (both times defeating James L. Key) promising to clean up the police department after a gambling scandal which also included an anti-Catholic platform. During his tenure, the Spring Street Viaduct was completed, the north half of which still stands after the southern half was rebuilt in 1996. He also built two new schools, not from bonds but from general revenue, and he also paid off a $1,000,000 deficit left over from the previous Key administration. In 1923, he proposed building an airport, sending alderman William Hartsfield to find a suitable location. Candler Field proved to be the best, and in 1925 the city leased it (the first five years were free) and the next year won a lucrative U.S. Mail route. In 1924, he opened the city's Municipal Market (today's Sweet Auburn Curb Market). He is buried in Arlington Memorial Park, in Sandy Springs, Georgia.

As a performance art, poi involves swinging tethered weights through a variety of rhythmical and geometric patterns. Poi artists may also sing or dance while swinging their poi. Poi can be made from various materials with different handles, weights, and effects (such as fire). Poi originated with the MƒÅori people of New Zealand, where it is still practiced today. Poi has also gained a following in many other countries. The expansion of poi culture has led to a significant evolution of the styles practiced, the tools used, and the definition of the word \\"poi.\\"  MƒÅori culture  A dance using traditional poi at TƒÅmaki MƒÅori Village In the MƒÅori language, poi can mean the physical objects used by the dancers, the choreography itself, or the accompanying music.Huata, NgƒÅmoni (2000), Te Rita Papesch, ed., The rhythm and life of poi, Auckland: HarperCollins, , pg 12 In MƒÅori culture, poi performance is usually practiced by women. Some legends indicate that it was first used by men to develop wrist flexibility for the use of hand weapons such as the club-like patu, mere, and kotiate,Poi Dance, TKI but recent academic study has found no evidence to confirm this story.Paringatai, Karyn (2004). Poia mai taku poi: Unearthing the knowledge of the past. Masters thesis, University of Otago. MƒÅori poi come in two forms: short, with strings equal to the length of the fingertips to the wrist; and long, with strings equal to the distance from fingertips to shoulder.Poi at TKIPoi performance video A performance includes storytelling and singing in conjunction with choreographed poi routines and is often presented alongside other disciplines, such as waiata a ringa, haka and titi torea (included in kapa haka performances). Poi feature in the 1980s hit song \\"Poi E\\".Poi E, nzhistory.net.nz = Traditional construction = Early 20th-century MƒÅori poi at the South Canterbury Museum in Timaru, New Zealand. Made of raup≈ç and stuffed with newspaper. Originally, poi were most commonly made from harakeke (New Zealand flax, Phormium tenax) and raup≈ç (Typha orientalis). Makers stripped and scraped flax to provide the muka (inner flax fibre), which was twisted into two strands to make the taura (cord) as well as the aho (ties). A large knot was tied at one end of the cord, around which the core was formed from the pithy middle of the raup≈ç stem. Dampened strips of raup≈ç stems were then wrapped around the ball and tied off around the cord, forming the covering . The other end of the cord was often decorated with a mukamuka, a tassel made from muka formed around a smaller knot. Occasionally, smaller tassels called poi piu were affixed to the base of the poi ball.Huata, pp 88-98 Construction and design varied widely depending on regional, tribal, and personal preferences. Another variety of poi is poi tƒÅniko. In this construction, the outer shell was made of finely woven muka using a pattern based on a fishing net;Huata pp99-100 these poi sometimes included strands that were dyed yellow to form a diamond pattern known as Te Karu ≈ç te Atua (the Eye of God). In the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, a cottage industry developed from the manufacture of raup≈ç poi for sale to tourists, especially in the Rotorua area. Tourist-friendly variations included miniature poi that could be worn in buttonholes and as earrings. Traditional raup≈ç poi are less likely to be used by modern poi artists since traditional materials wear quickly with frequent use. Also, flax and raup≈ç are becoming increasingly difficult to find as the wetlands where they are naturally found have been drained or made into conservation reserves (although traditional harvesting is, generally, allowed by law). Today, most performance poi are made from durable and readily available modern materials. Cores are often made of foam or crumpled paper, while skins consist of plastic or loomed fabrics, such as tulle. Tassels are usually made of wool.  Modern poi  Performer with fire poi Modern poi coexists with traditional Maori poi and enjoys a broader, worldwide audience. Traditional Maori poi is generally performed in group choreography at cultural events, with vocal and musical accompaniment. By contrast, modern poi is generally performed by individuals, without singing and with less structured choreography. The tools and styles used are more varied. Many people first encounter poi in the form of fire spinning, but fire spinning is just one form of this highly varied art. Modern poi borrows significantly from other physical arts, including various schools of dance and many object manipulation arts. Poi is practiced around the world and can often be seen at large festivals like Burning Man, European Juggling Convention. Unlike many physical arts, learning poi does not usually involve formal education. Most spinners learn from each other or teach themselves using DVDs or online resources. A strong sense of community and self-teaching are key elements of modern poi. Poi with tails = Practice poi = Beginners often learn using a simple pair of practice poi, which are typically constructed from soft materials such as socks or stockings that are weighted with soft household objects such as bean bags, juggling balls, balloons filled with legumes, or small toys. Simple poi can also be constructed from tennis balls and lengths of rope. More advanced practice poi models can include swivels (for orbital-type tricks), weighted handles (for tosses), or incorporate contact stage balls to enable the spinner to execute contact poi moves (i.e., rolls and fishtails). = Performance poi = Performers often use poi with bright, contrasting colors to enhance aesthetics and emphasize patterns. Some performance poi also incorporate tails or streamers for visual effect. Glow poi = Glow poi = Poi can be performed in the dark to dramatic effect when spinners use poi containing a light source, such as UV-sensitive materials, LED lights, or chemical glow sticks. Glowstringing, or using glowsticks swung from shoelaces, is popular at festivals and raves. It is also noted that while poi focuses on the manipulation of the head (the other side of the cord/chain from where you are holding), glowstringing focuses on the manipulation of the cord. Fire poi = Fire poi = Fire poi use wicks made from kevlar or Technora or another flame resistant material for the weighted ends. The wicks are soaked in fuel, set on fire, and then spun for dramatic effect.  Health benefits of poi  A scientific study conducted at the University of Auckland showed significant improvements in grip strength, balance, and attention after one month of poi practice.

Warlord of Hanzhong Map showing the major warlords of the Han dynasty in the 190s, including Zhang Lu Upon the death of his father, Zhang Heng (Âº†Ë°°), Zhang Lu inherited control of the Celestial Masters religious group, and therefore became its third leader (the first was Zhang Lu's grandfather Zhang Daoling). The religion enjoyed its greatest popularity in Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), but when Zhang Lu took control of the group, it was being challenged in the area by a shamanistic religion led by Zhang Xiu (ÂºµËÑ©, no family relation to Zhang Lu). Against this background, both Zhang Lu and Zhang Xiu were abruptly ordered by Liu Yan to go together to attack Su Gu (), the Han-appointed administrator of Hanzhong Commandery and take over his territory. However, having his own designs, Zhang Lu killed Zhang Xiu and took command of his troops and religious followers before he went off for the campaign against Hanzhong. He successfully managed to defeat Su Gu, and upon taking control of Hanzhong, renamed the region Hanning (), ruling it by the principles of his religion. It is worth noting that although he nominally followed the orders of Liu Yan, when Liu Zhang succeeded him many years later, Zhang Lu refused to follow Liu Zhang's orders. As a result, Liu Zhang ordered the execution of Zhang Lu's mother, younger brothers and many other family members. It is said that Zhang Lu's rule over his territory was for its time very humane and civilised. Roads were built throughout the territory with rest stops and foods provided free of charge. The taxes and donations taken from the people were not to be used for amusement, but instead for the support of the common people. In addition, under his leadership was a powerful army and strong defences such that neither Cao Cao nor Li Jue could easily defeat him. The Han central government recognised Zhang Lu's authority over Hanzhong Commandery and appointed him as General of the Household Who Guards Civilians () and the Administrator of Hanning (). According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, Zhang Lu received a jeweled seal from the common people of his realm, which was a sign from Heaven that he was to become a king. Many of his subordinates urged him to declare himself king, but his adviser Yan Pu () warned that to do so would bring disaster. Zhang Lu heeded Yan Pu's advice. Surrender to Cao Cao In 211, Zhong Yao suggested to the warlord Cao Cao, who was the de facto head of the Han central government, to launch an invasion of Hanzhong Commandery. Cao Cao heeded his advice and mobilised his forces. However, the warlords Ma Chao and Han Sui, who were based in the Guanzhong region in between Cao Cao's territories and Hanzhong Commandery, thought that Cao Cao wanted to attack them so they started a revolt against the Han central government, leading to the Battle of Tong Pass and subsequent battles. Although Cao Cao's forces emerged victorious against the Guanzhong warlords, they were in no condition to continue attacking Hanzhong Commandery so they retreated. Ma Chao escaped to Hanzhong Commandery after his defeat and pledged allegiance to Zhang Lu, who considered marrying his daughter to him. However, a subordinate of Zhang Lu's, Yang Bo (), said, \\"A man like that, who has no love for even his parents (referring to the execution of Ma Teng caused by Ma Chao's rebellion), cannot love another.\\" and the marriage proposal was scrapped. Ma Chao then borrowed soldiers from Zhang Lu and attempted to regain some of his lost territory from Cao Cao, but was ultimately unsuccessful. His failures caused the relationship between the two to sour. When Liu Bei's forces had surrounded Liu Zhang, Ma Chao chose this time to leave Hanzhong Commandery with his own followers and join Liu Bei. Ma Chao's subordinate Pang De, however, remained in Zhang Lu's service. In 215, Cao Cao again launched a campaign to conquer Hanzhong Commandery. Initially, Zhang Lu had no hope of standing against Cao Cao's armies, and planned to surrender. His younger brother Zhang Wei (), however, insisted on fighting and lead his army against the invading forces. He was soon killed in battle, and again Zhang Lu considered surrendering. His adviser Yan Pu, told him that surrendering so easily, they would have no position to negotiate from. Instead, Zhang Lu retreated to his fortress at Bazhong (). When leaving his capital, he did not destroy his wealth and treasures, nor attempt to take them with him, instead leaving them behind saying \\"These things belong to the country, not to me.\\" Cao Cao was greatly impressed by this, and sent a messenger to Zhang Lu asking him to surrender. Yan Pu's plan was successful, as Zhang Lu and his forces were warmly welcomed by Cao Cao. Cao Cao appointed Zhang Lu as General who Guards the South () and enfeoffed his five sons as marquises. Zhang Lu also married his daughter to Cao Yu, one of Cao Cao's sons. When Cao Cao turned Ma Chao's son Ma Qiu () over to Zhang Lu, Zhang Lu personally killed Ma Qiu ‚Äì most likely as revenge against Ma Chao's desertion. Zhang Lu died in 216 and was honoured with the posthumous title \\"Marquis Yuan\\" () by the Han imperial court. His sons continued to lead the Five Pecks of Rice religion, which later evolved into the Taoist religion known as Zhengyi Dao. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Zhang Lu is portrayed as strongly craving the title of King of Hanning, and attempting to aggressively expand his territory. In the novel, he attempts to invade Liu Zhang's Yi Province, only to be stopped. When Ma Chao left his service, he sent a servant Yang Bo () along to spy on him. However, when Ma Chao joined Liu Bei, he killed Yang Bo. See also * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms References * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

Cross Cross on 1950s postcard Jumonville is famous for its 60-foot-tall cross that stands on top of Dunbar's Knob (elevation 2480 ft). It is visible from seven counties, three states, and fifty miles on a clear day. Thousands of Sunday School children contributed dimes to help build the cross, and their names are sealed in the 183-ton concrete foundation. It was fabricated by Moore Metal Works of Greensburg, and erected on August 26, 1950. Dedication services were held on September 9. The cross arms project 12 feet on each side of the main shaft. The cross weighs 55 tons, and was designed to withstand 100 mph winds. The campus was developed as the PA Soldier's Orphan School after the Civil War. The school was moved from the old Madison College in Uniontown up to the mountain location with fresh air and a healthier environment for the children. The school operated from 1875 until 1908. The Whyel Chapel was built in 1880. Students were fed, clothed, and educated, and graduated at 16 years old with a trade or skill to support themselves. The property eventually passed through several owners and was donated by Harry Whyel to the Pittsburgh Conference of the Methodist Church in 1941. It operated as a summer only camp until 1970, and has hosted retreats and summer camps since then.

The AOC was created in 1936.

History The origin of the vineyard's name is unknown, although it is known to have been used since the High Medieval period,BIVB: Bonnes Mares (Fiche) and at least three different hypotheses exist. The most commonly prevailing assumption is that it may come from the bonnes m√®res (\\"good mothers\\"), nuns of the Cistercian order at Notre-Dame de Tart. A second hypothesis holds that it originates in the verb marer, to cultivate, which would give a translation of \\"good vintage\\". The third hypothesis, favored by the Drouhin family, is based on the myth of a winegrower who is said to have unearthed in this vineyard a sculpture representing three goddesses of fecundity, the bonnes m√®res. AOC regulations Pinot noir grapes. The main grape variety for Bonnes Mares is Pinot Noir. The AOC regulations also allow up to 15 per cent total of Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris as accessory grapes, but this is practically never used for any Burgundy Grand Cru vineyard. The allowed base yield is 35 hectoliter per hectare, a minimum planting density of 9,000 vines per hectare is required as well as a minimum grape maturity of 11.5 per cent potential alcohol.AOC regulations, last updated 2009 Wine style The style of Bonnes Mares wine is in general full- bodied and tannic. A difference in soil types over the length of the vineyard is often reflected in the style of wines, which can be either more in the style of Morey-Saint-Denis wine or in the style of Chambolle-Musigny wine, meaning lighter and more elegant.Wine Doctor: C√¥te de Nuits Part 1, accessed on December 1, 2009 See also *List of Burgundy Grand Crus References Category:Burgundy (historical region) AOCs ","title":"Bonnes Mares"},{"id":"1968245","text":"Paul Kunz (December 20, 1942 ‚Äì September 12, 2018) was an American Particle physicist and software developer, who initiated the deployment of the first web server outside of Europe.

The town was established in 1078 as an outpost of the Principality of Polatsk on the road from Polatsk to Kiev and Chernihov. According to the Drutsk Gospel, the town was built around one of the oldest Christian churches in White Ruthenia erected in 1001. In the 12th century and 13th century it was a centre of the early medieval Principality of Druck, ruled by the dukes of the Polatsk branch of the Rurikid dynasty. Since the 13th century there is only limited information about the town available in the chronicles. In 1524 Drutsk has been burned down by Russians in a war and started to lose its political importance. Exact time and reasons of the town's decline are unknown. Historians estimate the period of decline to between the 15th and 17th centuries. Archaeological researches state that Drutsk has been an important military fortress for some period of time. Until the mid 17th century it had a castle. Both the castle and the town have been destroyed and rebuilt for several times. According to the German ambassador of the 17th century Johann Georg Korb, in the 16th century Drutsk was a large city that had about two hundred churches but that was then entirely destroyed in a war. Therefore Korb compared the city with Troy. The town is also the name-sake of the Drucki-Lubecki and Druckoy-Sokolinski noble families and the name-sake for their coat of arms, the Druck Coat of Arms. The most famous member of those families is Franciszek Ksawery Drucki-Lubecki.

(2014). \\"Relational Power, Legitimation, and Pregnancy Discrimination.\\" Gender & Society 28(3): 435-462. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891243214523123 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women prohibits dismissal on the grounds of maternity or pregnancy and ensures right to maternity leave or comparable social benefits.Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, Article 11 The Maternity Protection Convention C 183 proclaims adequate protection for pregnancy as well. Though women have some protection in the United States because of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, it has not completely curbed the incidence of pregnancy discrimination. The Equal Rights Amendment could ensure more robust sex equality ensuring that women and men could both work and have children at the same time.  Motives  Employers discriminate on the grounds of pregnancy for a number of reasons: * prejudices against working women and mothers * fear of loss of productivity due to the absence of an employee * insufficient resources to support temporary employees or provide overtime pay for other employees to fulfill the duties during leave * belief that the employee will require too many accommodations even after her return * fear of loss of profits due to loss of productivity or the increased cost of productivity caused by the paid absence of an employee. United States In the United States, since 1978, employers are legally bound to provide the same insurance, leave pay, and additional support that would be bestowed upon any employee with medical leave or disability. This only applies to companies with 15 or more employees (including part-time and temporary workers). With more than 70% of women with children in the work force, pregnancy discrimination is the fastest growing type of discrimination in the U.S., and in 2006 represented approximately 6.5% of all discrimination claims filed. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission mediates claims between employees and employers. In 2006, the EEOC handled 4,901 claims with an eventual monetary pay-out by various organizations totaling $10.4 million. = Legislation = In 1978, the U.S. Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (P.L. 95-555), an amendment to the sex discrimination section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 2002, California's Paid Family Leave (PFL) insurance program, also known as the Family Temporary Disability Insurance (FTDI) program, extended unemployment disability compensation to cover individuals who take time off work to bond with a new minor child. PFL covers employees who take time off to bond with their own child or their registered domestic partner's child, or a child placed for adoption or foster-care with them or their domestic partner. Various U.S. cities have passed additional laws to protect pregnant workers. In 2014, New York City enacted the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act which requires employers offer reasonable accommodations \\"to the needs of an employee for her pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition that will allow the employee to perform the essential requisites of the job\\". Also in 2014, Philadelphia amended an ordinance which actually compels employers to make reasonable workplace accommodations for female employees \\"affected by pregnancy\\" meaning pregnant women or women who have medical conditions relating to pregnancy or childbirth. Philadelphia's revised ordinance identifies several possible required accommodations, including restroom breaks, periodic rest for those whose jobs require that they stand for long periods of time, special assistance with manual labor, leave for a period of disability arising from childbirth, reassignment to a vacant position, and job restructuring. In 2015, the Washington D.C. passed the Protecting Pregnant Workers Fairness Act of 2014 which is effective March 3, 2015. In 2018 Massachusetts did the same, with the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act going into effect on April 1, 2018. =Historical perspective= The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 and Family and Medical Leave Act are rooted in several major court decisions leading up to them. In the 1908 case Muller v. Oregon the Supreme Court upheld a decision limiting women to 10-hour workdays based on the idea that \\"performance of maternal functions\\" made women inherently incapable of the same work that men did. In the 1950s and 1960s laws in several states prohibited women from working and banned their hiring for some length of time before and after delivery. In 1971 Reed v. Reed became the first Supreme Court decision to invoke the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to protect women from discrimination on the basis of sex. In 1970 and 1971 the rights of pregnant schoolteachers were called into question. Many schoolteachers were forced to take unpaid maternity leaves around the fourth to sixth month of pregnancy for the reasons that it was potentially dangerous for the mother or child if the woman continued to work, she might not be able to focus on teaching, and students would be distracted by the visible signs of pregnancy.summary of Rosa Weiner's \\"Pregnant Teachers in the Classroom\\" (1987) by the Georgetown Law Library In 1974 in Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, the Supreme Court declared mandatory unpaid leave policies unconstitutional.Congress and the Nation, s.vv. \\"1798,\\" \\"Pregnancy Disability.\\" Vol. V, 1977-1980, p. 796 This was a big step towards gaining equal rights for women in the workforce. Two other major cases in the 1970s appear to be directly responsible for the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. The first, Geduldig v. Aiello (1974), ruled that the exclusion of medical benefits for pregnant women in California by the California State Disability Insurance program was non-discriminatory. > While it is true that only women can become pregnant ... the [California > State Disability Insurance] program divides potential recipients into two > groups- pregnant women and nonpregnant persons. While the first group is > exclusively female, the second group includes members of both sexes. The > fiscal and actuarial benefits of the program thus accrue to members of both > sexes. In 1976 General Electric v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125, set a similar precedent for private insurance through an employer. The uproar from these two decisions appears to have directly fueled the creation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act by Congress. In 2009 the Supreme Court again addressed pregnancy discrimination with their ruling in AT&T; Corp. v. Hulteen that held that maternity leave taken before the passage of the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act cannot be considered in calculating employee pension benefits, therefore essentially implying that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act is not retroactive. In 2014, a bill was passed in hopes of preventing discrimination. It has yet to become a federal law. European Union The European Union regards less favourable treatment on grounds of pregnancy as unlawful, and the same thing as discrimination on grounds of sex (contrasting to the American case of Geduldig v. Aiello and consistent with the American approach in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978). The European Court of Justice decided in Dekker v Stichting Vormingscentrum Voor Jonge Volwassen (VJV-Centrum) Plus[1990] ECR I-3941 that pregnancy discrimination was sex discrimination without any requirement for comparing this unfavourable treatment to a man. It reaffirmed this position in Webb v EMO Air Cargo (No 2)[1994] ECR I-3567 (C-32/93) where a woman had been dismissed because she had attempted to take pregnancy leave, but had not disclosed this to her employer when hired. As well as a dismissal, a failure to renew a fixed term contract may also be discrimination.Jimenez Melgar v Ayuntamiento de Los Barrios [2001] EC I-06915 (C-438/99) Furthermore, during any period of pregnancy or maternity leave there may be no detriment or dismissal in connection with a period of sickness.Brown v Rentokil Ltd [1998] ECR I-04185 (C-394/96) A woman is also allowed to shorten her maternity leave and return to work when she becomes pregnant again to get the second period of pregnancy, even though she is not fully able to carry out all her normal job functions.Busch v Klinikum Neustadt [2003] ECR I-020341 (C-109/00) It is also clear that women who are pregnant are protected at job interviews. In the Tele Danmark caseTele Danmark A/S v Handels-Og Kontorfunktionaerernes Forbund I Danmark (HK) acting on bhalf of Brandt-Nielsen [2001] IRLR 853, [2001] ECR I-06693 (C-109/00) a woman was held not to be at fault for not telling an employer she was pregnant while being interviewed for a job, despite knowing she was pregnant. However, a study published in The Netherlands is 2016 showed that 43% of active women experienced discrimination related to pregnancy of motherhood. Canada In Canada, pregnancy discrimination is considered a violation of sex-discrimination laws and will be treated as such. Other Mexico and Japan have laws to combat pregnancy discrimination. =Japan= In Japan, Labor Standards Act (Act No. 49 of 1947) provides that an employer must provide an expectant mother worker with maternity leave for 6 weeks (14 weeks for multiple pregnancy beyond twins) before her child birth and 8 weeks after the child birth. Article 9 of Equal Employment Opportunity Act between Men and Women (Act No. 113 of July 1, 1972) prohibits unequal employment condition for the reasons of marriage, pregnancy, maternity leave provided in Article 65 of Labor Standards Act and other reasons related childbirth. These unequal employment conditions includes retirement, dismissal. In addition, Act on the Welfare of Workers Who Take Care of Children or Other Family Members Including Child Care and Family Care Leave (Act No. 76 of 1991) provides that employees has the right to take unpaid child care leave for one year, and Article 10 prohibits for an employer to dismiss or disadvantageously treat a worker who have taken or is about to take Child Care Leave. as Although Maternity Leave and Child Care Leave are basically unpaid leave, Basic Childcare Leave Benefits are provided based on Employment Insurance Act during Child Care Leave and Maternity Allowance and Lump-sum Childbirth Allowance are given based on Health Insurance Act (Act No.70 of 1922). Basic Childcare Leave Benefit is 50% of the employee's wage, and Maternity Allowance is two thirds of the wage. As of 2013, Lump-sum Childcare allowance is ¬•420,000 (US$4,075). =Hong Kong= In Hong Kong, it is a criminal offence if an employer discriminates against a pregnant employee if the employee has been hired under a continuous contract. An employer who contravenes this can be liable to prosecution and, on conviction, fined HK$100,000. The employer would also be required to pay the employee's wages in lieu of notice, a further sum equivalent to one month's wages as compensation, and 10-weeks' maternity leave pay. Pregnant workers who feel they have been discriminated against because of their pregnancy are also protected by the Sex Discrimination Ordinance. Despite the law, women may still feel pressured to leave the workforce due to stress. =Taiwan= In Taiwan, pregnancy discrimination is considered a violation of sex-discrimination laws and are treated as such if an employer is found guilty. Despite the laws, discrimination against women and especially pregnant women is common place as it is rarely reported and discrimination is tolerated. = Cambodia = Discrimination of pregnant women is the main issue in Cambodia's garment industry. They were misunderstood with lower efficiency, frequent toilet breaks and maternity leave. According to one of the Cambodian female worker \\"It doesn't matter whether you are pregnant or not ‚Äì whether you are sick or not ‚Äì you have to sit and work. If you take a break, the work piles up on the machine and the supervisor will come and shout. And if a pregnant worker is seen working \\"slowly\\" then her contract will not be renewed.\\" Pregnant women are forced to either leave the factory or go for an abortion. In Cambodia abortion was legalized in 1997, yet 9 out of 10 Cambodian women believed that this action is illegal and undergo this process through unsafe clinics. According to the \\"Women's Health Cambodia\\", more than 90% of garment workers did not know abortion was legal and 18% out of 900 garment workers had an abortion. Almost 75% of the women do not know where to seek for a safe abortion as there were little information provided to them. In Cambodia, there are laws that provide pregnant women three months of maternity leave and maternity pay if the worker has worked for a year or longer. Most of the workers were given a fixed duration contract (FDC) with a 6 month contract period. Often the FDC of pregnant women are shortened as factories do not want to provide extra cost of maternity pays or any other health care. = Australia = Australia has tried to combat the issues of pregnancy discrimination in their workforce. After The United Nations created the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1981, Australia signed in agreement on August 17, 1983. Australia also passed the Sexual Discrimination act of 1984 to help eliminate discrimination in the workplace based on many things including pregnancy discrimination. This legislation doesn't allow or permit the right to base hiring and firing practices on pregnancy or the chance of pregnancy. The Sexual Discrimination Act also states, \\"It is unlawful to refuse the requests to accommodate a pregnant employee. It is also unlawful to accept the request, but take too long to accommodate those needs\\" However, it is reported despite the Sexual Discrimination Act of 1984 there are still many cases of work related discrimination based on pregnancy. Nearly one in two women (49%) surveyed by the AHRC reported experiencing pregnancy-related discrimination at work (AHRC, 2014: 26). Australia's government is having a hard time enforcing the Sexual Discrimination Act because employers are arguing that there is no way to prove their actions are based on the pregnancy of their female employees or interviewees. Women have a hard time in court proving that the discrimination was based on pregnancy. Employers can base their choice to pass on a candidate by saying that the women won't be able to perform certain tasks entailed in the job. This action has a hard time being refuted in court because employers can say there was another candidate that was more capable of the tasks and has nothing to do with pregnancy.

In the 1920s and 1930s Byam Shaw was a successful actor, both in romantic leads and in character parts. He worked frequently with his old friend John Gielgud. After working as co-director with Gielgud at the end of the 1930s, he preferred to direct rather than act. He served in the armed forces during the Second World War, and then took leading directorial posts at the Old Vic, the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre and Sadler's Wells (later known as the English National Opera). Life and career =Early years= Byam Shaw was born in London, the youngest of five siblings (four sons and one daughter) born to artist John Byam Liston Shaw and his wife, Caroline Evelyn Eunice Pyke-Nott (1870‚Äì1959), also an artist.Denison, Michael, \\"Shaw, Glencairn Alexander Byam (1904‚Äì1986)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, May 2007, accessed 25 June 2011 He was educated at Westminster School, where his contemporaries included his elder brother, James Byam Shaw, later a well-known art historian, and John Gielgud, who became a lifelong friend and professional colleague. The actor Michael Denison, biographer of Byam Shaw in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography writes that Byam Shaw made his professional stage debut in August 1923 with no prior training. Denison speculates that Byam Shaw's cousin, actress May Ward, a close friend of Dame Ellen Terry, \\"may have been enough to make him take the plunge\\". The Times said of him, \\"Tall, gentle, and graceful in movement, he was valuable in any cast, particularly in classics and in the Russian plays.\\"Obituary for Glen Byam Shaw, The Times, 1 May 1986. Byam Shaw's first appearance was at Torquay in the west of England, in C. K. Munro's comedy At Mrs. Beam's. In 1925 he made his London debut, playing Yasha in J.B. Fagan's production of The Cherry Orchard, in a cast that included Alan Napier as Gaiev, O.B. Clarence as Firs and Gielgud as the young student Trofimov.Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith‚Äì\\"The Cherry Orchard\\", The Times, 26 May 1925, p. 14 Over the next few years Byam Shaw appeared in three more plays by Chekhov, and in plays by Strindberg\\"The Theatres\\", The Times, 13 June 1927, p. 12 and Ibsen.\\"The Theatres\\", The Times, 1 November 1928, p. 12 He made his New York debut in November 1927 as Pelham Humphrey in And So To Bed.Gaye, pp. 1171‚Äì73 Actress Constance Collier was impressed by Byam Shaw and used her influence to gain him roles. Among those to whom she introduced him was Ivor Novello, then a leading figure in London theatre. She directed them both in the play Down Hill in 1926.\\"Queen's Theatre ‚Äì 'Down Hill',\\" The Times, 17 June 1926, p. 12 This drew him into contact with the poet Siegfried Sassoon, a friend of Collier; he and Byam Shaw became close.Roberts, pp. 198‚Äì200 Their friendship lasted for the rest of Sassoon's life, although they ceased to be partners quite quickly; Sassoon became involved with Stephen Tennant, and Byam Shaw fell in love with actress, Angela Baddeley.Roberts, p. 223 They married in 1929. The marriage, which lasted until her death in 1976, was, Denison writes, \\"a supremely happy one, both domestically and professionally\\"; the couple had a son and a daughter. =1930s and World War II= Byam Shaw and Baddeley toured together in South Africa in 1931, in a repertory of three plays. The following year, Byam Shaw appeared at the Lyceum in Max Reinhardt's mime play The Miracle, with Lady Diana Cooper as the Madonna, Tilly Losch as the nun and Leonid Massine as the Spielmann.\\"The Miracle\\", The Times, 5 January 1935, p. 10, and \\"The Miracle\\", The Manchester Guardian, 11 April 1932, p. 16 In 1933, Byam Shaw took over from Gielgud as Richard II in the long-running play Richard of Bordeaux by 'Gordon Daviot' (Josephine Tey); the following year he played Darnley in another historical play by the same author, Queen of Scots, opposite Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies and Laurence Olivier, directed by Gielgud.\\"The Theatres ‚Äì New Play by Gordon Daviot\\", The Times, 31 May 1934, p. 12 Byam Shaw continued to work with Gielgud, playing Laertes to his Hamlet in 1934, and Benvolio in the celebrated 1935 Old Vic production of Romeo and Juliet with Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet and Gielgud and Olivier alternating the roles of Romeo and Mercutio. During that Old Vic season, Gielgud invited Byam Shaw to join him in directing Richard II for the Oxford University Dramatic Society. Denison, who was in the cast, describes Byam Shaw as \\"stimulating, firm, and courteous to his undergraduate cast\\". Byam Shaw enjoyed the experience of directing, and never having especially enjoyed acting he turned gladly to direction. Gielgud engaged Byam Shaw to direct Dodie Smith's Dear Octopus in 1938 with a cast including Gielgud, Marie Tempest, Kate Cutler and Baddeley.Brown, Ivor. \\"Dear Octopus\\", The Manchester Guardian, 18 September 1938, p. 13 Byam Shaw concluded his acting career in the late 1930s in roles including D'Arcy in a dramatisation of Pride and Prejudice, character parts in The Merchant of Venice and Richard II, and Sir Benjamin Backbite in The School for Scandal. After appearing in Michel Saint-Denis's short season at the Phoenix Theatre in 1938, his final role was Horatio to Gielgud's Hamlet, both in London and at Elsinore Castle. As the Second World War loomed, Byam Shaw joined the emergency reserve of officers. In 1940 he was commissioned into the Royal Scots. He served in Burma from 1942 and was wounded. He ended his military service in 1945 as a major, making training films in India. While in Burma Byam Shaw conceived a production of Antony and Cleopatra dressed in the costumes of Shakespeare's time, rather than those of Ancient Rome and Egypt. On his return to civilian life, he directed it at the Piccadilly Theatre in 1946, with Godfrey Tearle and Edith Evans. The Manchester Guardian called his production \\"a very adroit and finished piece of work.\\"\\"Anthony and Cleopatra\\", The Manchester Guardian, 3 December 1946, p. 3 =Old Vic and Stratford= Between 1947‚Äì51 Byam Shaw was the director of the Old Vic Theatre School, part of the Old Vic Theatre Centre run by Michel Saint-Denis which also included the Young Vic run by George Devine. Denison writes \\"Despite much success in all fields the three partners fell foul of the Vic governors and of the theatre's top-heavy and largely hostile administration\\". The same board had earlier dismissed Ralph Richardson and Laurence Olivier as heads of the Old Vic company,Obituary for Ralph Richardson, The Guardian, 11 October 1983, p. 11 and now lost another leading team when Saint-Denis, Devine and Byan Shaw resigned in 1951. From 1952‚Äì59 Byam Shaw was director of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, first as co-director with Anthony Quayle, and in sole charge from 1956‚Äì59. He was appointed CBE in 1954. He directed 14 plays at Stratford; Denison singles out Antony and Cleopatra with Michael Redgrave and Ashcroft, Macbeth with Olivier and Vivien Leigh, As You Like It with Ashcroft, Othello with Harry Andrews and Emlyn Williams, and King Lear with Charles Laughton and Albert Finney. Before the 1950s, Stratford seasons had been widely regarded as worthy but unexciting. Under Quayle and Byam Shaw Stratford became one of the principal centres of British theatre, attracting the leading directors such as Gielgud, Peter Hall and Peter Brook. In 1959, he handed over to Hall, whom he had chosen as his successor. =Opera= In 1962, despite describing himself as tone deaf, Byam Shaw accepted the post of director of productions at Sadler's Wells Opera. He worked closely with the company's managing director, Norman Tucker, and musical director, Colin Davis. Tucker's successor, Lord Harewood, recalled \\"a series of striking productions, including The Rake's Progress, Cos√¨ fan tutte, Der Freisch√ºtz and A Masked Ball ‚Ä¶ a notable elegant and witty Die Fledermaus, Hansel and Gretel ‚Ä¶ and Gluck's Orpheus.\\"Harewood, Lord. \\" Obituary of Mr Glen Byam Shaw\\", The Times, 7 May 1986 Byam Shaw's most celebrated opera productions were in collaboration with the conductor Reginald Goodall, first The Mastersingers, the company's last major production at Sadler's Wells Theatre, and, after its move to the London Coliseum in 1968, the four operas of Wagner's Ring cycle, in which Byam Shaw's co-director was his former assistant John Blatchley. Byam Shaw's last collaboration with Goodall was Tristan and Isolde in 1981. He was awarded a CBE in 1954 and received an honorary DLitt from the University of Birmingham in 1959. Death Glen Byam Shaw died in Goring-on-Thames at the age of 81, survived by his children and extended family.Wilson, Scott.

Description The nine-pound battery-powered 1984 Data General-One ran MS-DOS and had dual 3¬Ω\\" diskettes, a 79-key full-stroke keyboard, 128K to 512K of RAM, and a monochrome LCD screen capable of either the standard 80√ó25 characters or full CGA graphics (640√ó200). It was a laptop comparable in capabilities to desktops of the era. History The Data General-One offered several features in comparison with contemporary portable computers. For instance, the popular 1983 Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 100, a non-PC-compatible machine, was comparably sized. It was a small battery-operated computer resting in one's lap, but had a 40√ó8 character (240√ó64 pixel) screen, a rudimentary ROM-based menu in lieu of a full OS, and no built-in floppy. IBM's 1984 Portable PC was comparable in capability with desktops, but was not battery operable and, being much larger and heavier, was by no means a laptop. Drawbacks The DG-1 was only a modest success. One problem was its use of 3¬Ω\\" diskettes. Popular software titles were thus not widely available (5.25\\" being still the standard), a serious issue since then- common diskette copy-protection schemes made it difficult for users to copy software into that format. The CPU was a CMOS version of the 8086, compatible with the IBM PC's 8088 except it ran slightly slower, at 4.0 MHz instead of the standard 4.77 MHz. Unlike the Portable PC, the DG-1 laptop could not take regular PC/XT expansion cards. RS232 serial ports were built-in, but the CMOS (low battery consumption) serial I-O chip available at design time, a CMOS version of the Intel 8251, was register incompatible with the 8250 serial IC standard for the IBM PC. As a result, software written for the PC serial ports would not run correctly. This required the use of software written using the relatively slower and less flexible BIOS interrupt call (014h), or software written exclusively for the DG-1. Video memory came out of that available for the operating system; if 256 kB of RAM was installed, only 204 kbytes might be available to the operating system and user's programs. Although Creative Computing termed the price of US$2895 \\"competitive,\\" it was a very expensive system, and usually-needed additions such as more RAM and an external 5¬º\\" drive drove the price higher yet. The styling of the product, including a bag designed by Pierre Cardin, implied a more up-market buyer than many typical PC buyers of the time. The Data General-One also had a built-in dumb terminal emulator, suggesting an attempt to attract as customers those in organisations with large, expensive minicomputers or mainframes that would access corporate data via terminals such as the ADM-3A or Data General's own Dasher terminals (the cost of the laptop would not have seemed excessive in such situations). The screen was this computer's other great flaw. Although unusually large, the LCD display had very low contrast and narrow viewing angle. InfoWorld stated that \\"the godawful screen made a better mirror than display\\", and PC Magazine reported that \\"The exchange 'Why don't you turn it on?' / 'It is on' is no joke. It happened in our offices.\\" Merged content Despite the memorable advertisements (\\"The first computer able to fit inside the IBM PC\\"), the DG-1 was only a modest success. One problem was the use of 3¬Ω\\" diskettes, which were slightly ahead of their time; popular software titles were not available in 3¬Ω-inch format, and this was a serious issue, because then-common diskette copy-protection schemes made it difficult for users to copy the software into that format. Additionally, the diskettes used a proprietary formatting scheme not compatible with products from other companies. Although Creative Computing termed the price of US$2895 \\"competitive\\", it was a very expensive system and optional additions, such as expanded RAM and an external 5¬º-inch floppy drive, drove the price considerably higher. The 4.0 MHz CPU speed was fractionally slower than the then-current 4.77 MHz IBM PC. The Achilles' heel, however, was the LCD, which was not backlit, had poor contrast, and was frequently accused of serving better as a mirror than as a display screen. Usable outdoors or in bright offices only, a flashlight, it was joked, was often necessary to see the contents of the screen. Another product killer was the incompatible serial port chip, an Intel 82C51, which was used to conserve power, instead of the 8250 used in the IBM PC. For a portable system, this was a critical flaw: PC programs that used the serial port wouldn't run on the DG-1 due to the non- standard register arrangement within the 82C51. An updated version of the DG-1 appeared later with a much improved electroluminescent screen. However, the light-producing display could be washed out by bright sunlight. Additionally, the new screen was power hungry and consumed so much power that the battery option was removed, thereby causing the DG-1 to lose its status as a true portable.

Published from October 1974 until December 1985, the magazine covered the spectrum of hobbyist/home/personal computing in a more accessible format than the rather technically oriented Byte. The company published several books, the most successful being BASIC Computer Games, the first million-selling computer book. Their Best of Creative Computing collections were also popular. Creative Computing also published software on cassette and floppy disk for the popular computer systems of the time and had a small hardware business. Ziff-Davis purchased Creative Computing in 1983 and closed the non-magazine endeavors. History =DEC and Edu= Prior to starting Creative Computing, in the early 1970s David H. Ahl was working in the educational department of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) where he started publication of their Edu newsletter in the spring of 1971. He was surprised to find that the number of subscribers, which reached 20,000 after 18 months, was much larger than the 2,000 or 3,000 he predicted based on the number of DEC machines in educational settings. He found that many subscribers did not have a DEC machine but were using Edu as a source of general information on computers in educational settings. This began his earliest thoughts about a non-DEC magazine aimed at this market. On February 22, 1973, Ahl was let go during a downsizing at DEC. But before he received his last paycheck, he was hired by a different department to help develop new low-end versions of the DEC minicomputer line. During this period he collected many user submissions to Edu and convinced DEC to publish 101 BASIC Computer Games in the summer of 1973. This was a hit, and eventually ran three publishing runs; July 1973, April 1974, and March 1975. By 1974, the team had produced two new designs, a PDP-8 combined with a VT50 terminal, and a briefcase-sized version of the PDP-8 with a small floppy disk. When these were personally canceled by Ken Olsen with the statement that \\"I can't see any reason that anyone would want a computer of his own\\" Ahl quit DEC and took a position at AT&T.; =Formation= It was at this point that Ahl decided to move ahead with the educational-focused magazine. Reasoning that the educational market would be of interest to public foundations and many companies, Ahl sent funding proposals to over a hundred companies and received nothing. Instead, he used his own funds to print 11,000 copies of a flier that he sent to Hewlett-Packard and other minicomputer vendors, which resulted in 850 subscriptions to a magazine that did not even exist yet. Instead of printing 850 copies, Ahl split the subscription money in two; he kept one half for future operations, and used the other half to print as many copies of the new magazine as he could. This allowed for the printing of 8,000 copies of the first edition, which were completed on 7 October 1974. The subscribers were sent their copies first, but the rest were sent for free to a wide variety of companies, libraries and schools. He followed the same pattern for the next three issues. The trick worked, and subscriptions began to pour in. During this period the magazine was based in Morristown, New Jersey. =Growth= Back of the April 1980 issue, with a parody of other computer magazines By August 1975 the magazine had 2,500 subscribers. In January, the Altair 8800 had been announced and Ahl began looking for new authors who could write for the exploding microcomputer market. By 1976 the content was roughly split between the education and microcomputing market. At that point, the magazine started actively looking for advertisers and the November/December 1976 issue was the first to be printed on coated paper rather than newsprint to provide better quality ads. By 1978 the subscriptions hit 60,000, and revenue was approaching $1 million. In July 1978, Ahl quit his position at AT&T; to work at Creative Computing full time. This caused friction with his wife. In August, they purchased ROM magazine and two smaller newsletters and combined their content into the magazine. In January 1979, the magazine went monthly from bimonthly. By 1979 the magazine had outgrown the single-family home it was being run from, and Ahl looked for a larger duplex home that would allow him to live with his wife in one half and run the magazine from the other. It was at this time that Regis McKenna, the advertizing company handling Apple Computer was asked to pay an overdue advertising bill. The company provided a canceled check proving they had already done so. When they began tracking it down, the police were called and found that two people in the company had conspired to embezzle $100,000 by sending incoming cheques to a different bank. This was only discovered because one of the conspirators had forgotten to mark the bill as paid so a second invoice was sent out. When she was told the story, Ahl's wife had enough and kicked him out of the house pending a divorce. He moved into the only unused room in the other side of the building. During this time, Ted Nelson, known for the invention of hypertext, was briefly the editor. Nelson would arrive at 5 pm and work all night, waking Ahl in the bedroom when he started printing on a Qume daisy wheel printer. In October 1980 the company moved to a much larger office building. Through this period, featured writers included Robert Swirsky, David Lubar, and John J. Anderson. The magazine regularly included BASIC source code for utility programs and games, which users could manually enter into their home computers. The April issues, starting in 1980, became famous for their parodies of the major computer magazines of the time. =Ziff-Davis= Larger publishers began taking note of the computer market. A watershed moment was in 1979 when McGraw-Hill purchased Byte. By 1982, most of the quality magazines had been purchased and only a few large ones remained independent, including Compute!, Interface Age, Family Computing and Creative Computing. Realizing they were being pushed out of the market due to the huge budgets and marketing power of these major players, in 1982 Ahl approached several potential buyers, including Atari, CBS and Ziff-Davis. In 1983 Ahl sold the company to Ziff- Davis, which at that time published 28 different magazines. Ahl remained the Editor-in-Chief. The magazine moved to Los Angeles, California. At their peak, the magazine reached about 500,000 subscriptions. Through the early 1980s, and especially with the launch of the IBM PC, the market began to shift from a hobby-and-educational oriented one to more and more business applications. Ziff quickly shifted the focus of the magazine to be more software-oriented, and the programming articles disappeared shortly after the sale. This attempt to refocus on business computing was not successful, and when Bill Ziff had a cancer scare in 1985 he began concentrating his businesses, selling off many of the specialty magazines. Ziff ultimately ceased publication of Creative Computing in December 1985. Other magazines The company also began publication of several other magazines at different times, but none of these were very successful and tended to have very short production runs. Among these were Small Business Computing, Sync Magazine for the ZX81, and Video and Arcade Games. Books The company also published several books. Among these were three volumes of The Best of Creative Computing Magazine (Creative Computing Press) in 1976, 1977, and 1980. The cover of volume 2 was illustrated by underground cartoonist Gilbert Shelton. 101 BASIC Computer Games was ported to Microsoft BASIC and published in 1978 as BASIC Computer Games. It became the first million-selling computer book. This was followed by More BASIC Computer Games in 1979. It also published the first The Best of Byte collection, in spite of being friendly competitors with Byte. The relationship ended with the McGraw-Hill purchase. Software Box art style used by Creative Computing Software A number of home computer games were published under the Sensational Software banner, also known as Creative Computing Software. Their best seller was a version of Space Invaders for the Apple II. Ziff-Davis closed the division as they felt it competed with their advertisers. Titles included: * Air Traffic Controller (1979) *: Released on cassette for the TRS-80 and Apple II. * Space Games-3 (1980) CS-3002 *: A collection of 4 games, containing Ultratrek, Romulan, Starwars, Starlanes; released on cassette for the TRS-80. * Space and Sport Games (1980) *: A collection of 9 games, with 3 space games amongst them. Released on diskette for the Apple II. * Super Invasion/Spacewar (1980) *: A collection of 2 games, containing Super Invasion and Spacewar; released on diskette for the Apple II. * Action & Bumping Games (1981) *: A collection of 6 games, containing Bumper Blocks, Obstacle Course, Hustle Jr., Moto Jump, Mine Rover, Road Machine; released on diskette for the Apple II. * Milestones (1981) *: Released on cassette and diskette for the Apple II. Hardware The company also briefly sold hardware under the Peripherals Plus brand. The main product was a music card for the Apple II, although they also sold a plotter and a few other products. Ziff closed this division as well.

It covers a diversity of activities that can affect human health and the environment, and acts to address any pollution issues not covered by other federal laws. As such, the Act is a \\"catch all\\" piece of legislation that ensures potentially toxic substances are not inadvertently exempt from federal oversight as a result of unforeseen legislative loopholes. The Act also recognizes the contribution of pollution prevention and the management and control of toxic substances and hazardous waste to reducing threats to Canada's ecosystems and biological diversity. It acknowledges, for the first time, the need to virtually eliminate the most persistent toxic substances that remain in the environment for extended periods of time before breaking down and bioaccumulative toxic substances that accumulate within living organisms. Health Canada works in partnership with Environment and Climate Change Canada to assess potentially toxic substances and to develop regulations to control toxic substances. Section 93 of the Act provides the authority to the federal government to make regulations to restrict and manage pollution in Canada.  History  Originally enacted in 1988, the Act provided a systematic approach to assess and manage chemical substances in the environment that were not addressed under existing programs. After being reviewed in the 1990s, it was replaced by the current legislation that provides new powers for health and environmental protection. It was introduced as Bill C-32 on , subsequently receiving Royal Assent on . The Act came into force on . As a Canadian statute, the Act is unique for including a declaration of \\"primary purpose\\" in addition to a preamble.  New and existing substances  = New substances = All new substances must be evaluated for human health and environmental risks before they can be manufactured or imported into Canada. Responsibility for these evaluations is shared between Environment Canada and Health Canada and is administered by the New substances Program, which administers regulations relating to the notification of new substances into the environment. = Existing substances = Existing substances include all 23,000 substances that were in use in Canada prior to the establishment of the New Substances Notification Program, and they are all listed on the Domestic Substances List (DSL). The Act required systematic screening of these substances, a process that was completed in September 2006, which led to the development of the Chemicals Management Plan. = Biotechnology = The 23,000 existing substances on the DSL included 67 microbial strains and 2 complex microbial cultures. These substances were subject to a separate prioritization assessment and accordingly evaluated.For example, see the review of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains ATCC 31480, 700370 and 700371 that summarizes the outcome of the complete screening assessment, completed in August 2010. Health Canada and Environment Canada share responsibility for conducting risk assessments of new biotechnology products (including micro-organisms) that are not subject to a pre-manufacture toxicity assessment under other federal legislation. Under the Act, both naturally occurring and genetically modified organisms are evaluated under the New Substances Notification Regulations (Organisms). Risk assessment decisions are summarized and posted publicly.  Enforcement, penalties and prosecution  Enforcement activities related to the Act can include: * warnings regarding the existence of a violation so that the alleged offender can act and return to compliance; * directions to deal with or to prevent illegal releases of regulated substances; * tickets for offences (e.g. failure to submit written reports); * various orders (e.g. prohibition orders, orders to recall illegal substances or products from the marketplace, environmental protection compliance orders to put an immediate stop to illegal activity) to prevent a violation from occurring or require action to be taken; * injunctions; * prosecution under the authority of a Crown prosecutor; and * environmental protection alternative measures. =Environmental Enforcement Act= Fines under the Environmental Enforcement Act (EEA) range from $5,000 to $6,000,000. The EEA applies to offences under CEPA 1999. The EEA also allows arrest without warrant, seize or detain anything items related to a CEPA 1999 offence or related evidence, detain or redirect ships suspected of an offence. Convictions or indictments under the EEA can also result in imprisonment up to three years. Prosecutions under CEPA 1999 are listed on Environment Canada's website.

Developed by Thomas Rowe and opened in 1928, it gained renown as the Gulf playground for America's pampered rich at the height of the Jazz Age and it still serves as a popular retreat for the rich and famous of today. The hotel was designed by Henry H. Dupont. The Don CeSar is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Construction In 1924, Thomas Rowe purchased of land in St. Petersburg, Florida for $100,000 to begin his dream of building a \\"pink castle\\". He hired Indianapolis architect Henry Dupont to design the hotel and Carlton Beard as contractor. To ensure the stability of the hotel on the shifting sand and avoid the high cost of sinking so many pilings, Beard devised a floating concrete pad and pyramid footings. To this day there is no sign of evident settling of the hotel. The architecture is a blend of Mediterranean and Moorish styles modeled after different hotels and developments that Rowe and Beard saw in Palm Beach, Coral Gables and Boca Raton. Arched openings, red clay tile roofs, balconies, stucco over hollow tile and tower like upper stories were some of the elements that they borrowed. The original design called for a $450,000 six-story hotel with 110 rooms and baths. It was later expanded to 220 rooms and 220 baths and the costs soared to $1.25 million, 300% over budget. Rowe named it Don Ce-Sar after Don C√©sar de Bazan, the hero of William Vincent Wallace's opera Maritana. Opening Rowe's \\"Pink Lady\\" opened on January 16, 1928, with an extravagant party attended by the elite of Tampa and St. Petersburg. The hotel quickly became a favorite romping ground for the rich and famous of the Jazz Age including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Clarence Darrow, Al Capone, Lou Gehrig, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Pink Palace continued to attract the rich and famous throughout the Great Depression, thanks in part to a deal made with New York Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert to house his team during spring training for three years. However, after the sudden death of Rowe without a will, \\"The Don\\" was left to his estranged wife and began to fall into disrepair until the United States entered into World War II and the hotel was bought out by the Army for $450,000. It was converted into a military hospital and reopened in December 1942. In February 1944 the Don Ce-Sar became a United States Army Air Corps convalescent center. In June 1945 the Don Ce-Sar was ordered closed and was vacant by September of that year. It was converted into a Veterans Administration Regional Office by the end of 1945. Rebirth In November 1967 the Veterans Administration began moving out of the Don Ce-Sar. By spring 1969, the once grand hotel was vacant. The General Services Administration planned to raze the graffiti-covered hotel, but this was met with fierce opposition from local residents. In March 1972 the Don Ce-Sar was sold to C.L. Pyatt and William Bowman Jr., a Holiday Inn franchise owner. The Don CeSar (now spelled without the hyphen) reopened on November 23, 1973. Multiple renovations from 1985 to 2001 have updated and added onto the hotel, including a spa, a signature restaurant, and a second outdoor swimming pool. After the addition of the full-service beach club and spa, the official name of the hotel was changed to The Don CeSar Beach Resort and Spa. The Don CeSar was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and became a founding member of the National Trust Historic Hotels of America in 1989.

A native of Toronto and graduate of De La Salle College, D'Amico's NHL career started as a referee on October 12, 1964, when he was 27 years old. He refereed only 19 games before becoming a linesman. At the time of his retirement after the 1987 season, D'Amico was the last on-ice official active during the Original Six era. D'Amico's career included 1,689 regular season games, four All-Star games, including the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87, and 247 Stanley Cup playoff games, including 52 Stanley Cup Finals. His last one was in 1987. He also worked the Canada Cup. In 1988, D'Amico was watching a Leafs game on TV at home when a linesman had to leave a game because of an injury. Not missing a beat, D'Amico grabbed his skates, drove to Maple Leaf Gardens and finished the game. This would become his last on-ice performance as an NHL linesman. After retirement, he became a supervisor of officials for the NHL, a position he held until his death at age 67 after a long battle with leukemia and bone cancer. D'Amico was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1993. His health problems started in September 2002 when he suffered a heart attack and underwent bypass surgery. Tests following surgery indicated blood abnormalities and a diagnosis of aplastic anemia, which resulted in gallstone problems. Just before his death, D'Amico made news headlines across Canada when he spoke out about the poor quality of the country's health care system. D'Amico is survived by wife Dorothy, sons Angelo, Jeff and Anthony, and daughter Tina. Angelo followed in his father's footsteps and was an NHL official from 2000 to 2006. He was renowned during his career for his immense physical strength. This was especially evident when he was required to break up fights on the ice.

They had a daughter (the actress Kate Alderton) and two sons and also acted together in spin-off series, Thomas & Sarah, and another sitcom, No, Honestly, as well as in Wodehouse Playhouse (1975‚Äì78), a series that featured adaptations of short stories by P. G. Wodehouse (primarily the Mr. Mulliner stories.) In the meantime, he appeared on the big screen against-type as 'Friend' in John Boorman's cult sci-fi film Zardoz (1974), before returning to more familiar territory, as 1930s Yorkshire vet James Herriot in the 1976 film, It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet. He was a subject of the television programme This Is Your Life in 1974 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. = Stage roles = He graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1961 and appeared in their production of The Doctor and The Devils by Dylan Thomas. He made his first stage appearance with the repertory company of the Theatre Royal, York in August 1961, in Badger's Green by R.C. Sherriff. After a period in repertory, made his first London appearance at the Mermaid, November 1965, as Harold Crompton in Spring and Port Wine, later transferring with the production to the Apollo. At the Aldwych, March 1969, played Eric Hoyden in the RSC's production of Dutch Uncle. At the Comedy Theatre, July 1969, played Jimmy Cooper in The Night I Chased the Women with an Eel. At the Howff, October 1973, played Stanley in Punch and Judy Stories, and played the same part in \\"Judies\\" at the Comedy, January 1974. At the Shaw, January 1975, played Stanley in Pinter's The Birthday Party. At the Apollo, May 1976, played four parts in Ayckbourn's Confusions. Post-1980 career During the 1980s and 1990s, Alderton had few roles. He narrated the children's original animated series Little Miss in 1983 (with his wife Pauline Collins) and, from 1987 to 1994, narrated and voiced all the characters in the original series of Fireman Sam. In 1988, he starred as Surgeon Robert Sandy in Tales of the Unexpected, in the episode The Surgeon, and from 1989 to 1992 he starred in the series Forever Green as the character Jack Boult. he also appeared in the film Clockwork Mice in 1995. Alderton played opposite his wife Pauline in Mrs Caldicot's Cabbage War in 2002 and made something of a comeback in the 2003 film, Calendar Girls. Then, in 2004 he played a role in the BBC series of Anthony Trollope's He Knew He Was Right. Also in 2004, Alderton starred in the first series of ITV 1's Doc Martin in an episode entitled \\"Of All The Harbours in All The Towns\\" as sailor John Slater, a friend and former lover of Aunt Joan. He played Christopher Casby in the 2008 BBC adaptation of Charles Dickens' Little Dorrit. Personal life Alderton married actress Jill Browne in 1964, but they later divorced. In 1969, he married actress Pauline Collins and they had three children, a daughter and two sons. Alderton is also the stepfather of Collins' daughter Louise.

Many government and non-governmental organizations directly engage in programs of afforestation to create forests, increase carbon capture. Sometimes special tools, such as a tree planting bar, are used to make planting of trees easier and faster. The rate of net forest loss decreased substantially over the period 1990‚Äì2020 due to a reduction in deforestation in some countries, plus increases in forest area in others through afforestation and the natural expansion of forests. In areas of degraded soil In some places, forests need help to reestablish themselves because of environmental factors. For example, in arid zones, once forest cover is destroyed, the land may become dry and inhospitable for the growth of new trees. Other factors include overgrazing by livestock, especially animals such as goats, cows, and over-harvesting of forest resources. Together these may lead to desertification and the loss of topsoil; without soil, forests cannot grow until the long process of soil creation has been completed - if erosion allows this. In some tropical areas, forest cover removal may result in a duricrust or duripan that effectively seal off the soil to water penetration and root growth. In many areas, reforestation is impossible because people are using the land. In other areas, mechanical breaking up of duripans or duricrusts is necessary, careful and continued watering may be essential, and special protection, such as fencing, may be needed.  Forests to attract rain  Several new studies suggest that forests attract rain and this may explain why drought is occurring more frequently in parts of the world such as western Africa. A new study by Carol Rasmussen, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory gives the first observational evidence that the southern Amazon rain forest triggers its own rainy season using water vapor from plant leaves. The finding helps explain why deforestation in this region is linked with reduced rainfall.Carol Rasmussen (2017), New study shows the Amazon makes its own rainy season, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2608/new-study-shows-the-amazon-makes-its-own- rainy-season/ A study by Douglas Sheil and Daniel Murdiyarso hypothesises that forest cover plays a much greater role in determining rainfall than previously recognized. It explains how forested regions generate large-scale flows in atmospheric water vapor. Makarieva and Gorshkov have developed a hypothesis to explain how forests attract moist air and increase rainfall in area covered by trees.Makarieva AM, Gorshkov VG, 2007, Biotic pump of atmospheric moisture as driver of the hydrological cycle on land, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 11: 1013‚Äì1033 Countries and regions =Australia= In Adelaide, South Australia (a city of 1.3 million as of June 2016), Premier Mike Rann (2002 to 2011) launched an urban forest initiative in 2003 to plant 3 million native trees and shrubs by 2014 on 300 project sites across the metro area. Thousands of Adelaide citizens have participated in community planting days on sites including parks, reserves, transport corridors, schools, water courses and coastline. Only Native trees were planted to ensure genetic integrity. He said the project aimed to beautify and cool the city and make it more liveable; improve air and water quality and reduce Adelaide's greenhouse gas emissions by 600,000 tonnes of C02 a year.http://www.milliontrees.com.au =Brazil= There are ongoing afforestation efforts to counter the significant deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest in Brazil. In Para, Brazil, 1 billion trees were intended to be planted to restore deforested lands by 2013. =China= Strips of forest are planted along hundreds of kilometers of the Yangtze levees in Hubei provinceÁúÅÊ≤≥ÈÅìÂ†§Èò≤Âª∫ËÆæÁÆ°ÁêÜÂ±Ä2016Âπ¥Â∑•‰ΩúË¶ÅÁÇπ (The work goals of the provincial waterway flood protection levee administration for 2016), 2016-02-17 China has deforested most of its historically wooded areas. China reached the point where timber yields declined far below historic levels, due to over-harvesting of trees beyond sustainable yield.G.A.McBeath, 2006 Although it has set official goals for reforestation, these goals are set over an 80-year time horizon and have not been significantly met by 2008. China is trying to correct these problems by projects like the Green Wall of China, which aims to replant a great deal of forests and halt the expansion of the Gobi desert. The Green Wall of China Project has historical precedences dating back to before the Common Era. However, in pre-modern periods, government sponsored afforestation projects along the historical frontier regions were mostly for military fortification. A law promulgated in 1981 requires that every school student over the age of 11 plants at least one tree per year. As a result, China has the highest afforestation rate of any country or region in the world, with 47,000 square kilometers of afforestation in 2008. However, the forest area per capita is still far lower than the international average. According to Carbon Brief, China planted the largest amount of new forest out of any country between 1990 and 2015, facilitated by the country's Grain for Green programme started in 1999, by investing more than $100bn in afforestation programmes and planting more than 35bn trees across 12 provinces. By 2015, the amount of planted forest in China covered 79m hectares. From 2011‚Äì2016, the city Dongying in Shandong province forested over 13,800 hectares of saline soil through the Shandong Ecological Afforestation Project, which was launched with support from the World Bank. In 2017, the Saihanba Afforestation Community won the UN Champions of the Earth Award in the Inspiration and Action category for \\"transforming degraded land into a lush paradise\\". =Europe= Europe has deforested the majority of its historical forests. The European Union (EU) has paid farmers for afforestation since 1990, offering grants to turn farmland back into forest and payments for the management of forest. Between 1993 and 1997, EU afforestation policies made possible the re-forestation of over 5,000 square kilometres of land. A second program, running between 2000 and 2006, afforested more than 1,000 square kilometres of land (precise statistics not yet available). A third such program began in 2007. Europe's forests are growing by 8,000 square kilometres a year thanks to these programmes. According to Food and Agriculture Organization statistics, Spain had the third fastest afforestation rate in Europe in the 1990-2005 period, after Iceland and Ireland. In those years, a total of 44,360 square kilometers were afforested, and the total forest cover rose from 13,5 to 17,9 million hectares. In 1990, forests covered 26.6% of the Spanish territory. As of 2007, that figure had risen to 36.6%. Spain today has the fifth largest forest area in the European Union. In January 2013 the UK government set a target of 12% woodland cover in England by 2060, up from the then 10%. In Wales the National Assembly for Wales has set a target of 19% woodland cover, up from 15%. Government-backed initiatives such as the Woodland Carbon Code are intended to support this objective by encouraging corporations and landowners to create new woodland to offset their carbon emissions. Charitable groups such as Trees for Life (Scotland) also contribute to afforestation and reforestation efforts in the UK. Alpine and Subalpine regions have undergone a lot of deforestation and then forestation in the last 300 years. Out of this has emerged much practical experience. One example is the clustered group, which is a method to bring in stable age mixed tree communities. =Hong Kong= Since the founding of the crown colony in the 19th century, afforestation has taken place to prevent soil erosion in the catchment areas of the reservoirs that were built. During the Japanese occupation in the Second World War, the countryside was deforested as the remaining population required fuel to survive. Most of the trees were cut down and extensive reafforestation was carried out after the war. Trees that were planted are mostly non-native species, such as: Pinus massoniana, Acacia confusa (Formosan acacia), Lophostemon confertus and the Paper Bark Tree. =India= Afforestation in South India According to the NASA study, China and India have led in increasing the Earth's greenery over the past two decades. In 1950 around 40.48 million hectares was covered by forest. In 1980 it increased to 67.47 million hectares and in 2006 it was found to be 69 million hectares. 23% of India is covered by forest. In 2018, the total forest and tree cover in India increased to 24.39% or 8,02,088 km2. The forests of India are grouped into 5 major categories and 16 types based on biophysical criteria. 38% of the forest is categorized as subtropical dry deciduous and 30% as tropical moist deciduous and other smaller groups. Only local species are planted in an area. Trees bearing fruits are preferred wherever possible due to their function as a food source. In 2019, Indians Planted 220 Million trees in a Single day in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5d501f43e4b0fc06ace91e2a On Thursday, 29 August 2019, Prime Minister of India Mr. Narendra Modi released ‚Çπ47, 436 crores (over 6.6 Bn USD) to various states for compulsory afforestation activities. The funds can be used for treatment of catchment areas, assisted natural generation, forest management, wildlife protection and management, relocation of villages from protected areas, managing human- wildlife conflicts, training and awareness generation, supply of wood saving devices and allied activities. Increasing the tree cover would help in creating additional carbon sink to meet the nation's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by the year 2030 - part of India's efforts to combat climate change. The Maharashtra government planted almost 20,000,000 saplings in the entire state, and will pledge to plant another 30,000,000 next year. According to The Telegraph, the Indian government has attributed $6.2 billion for tree-planting in order to increase ‚Äúforestation in line with agreements made at the Paris climate change summit in 2015.‚Äù The Indian government has also passed the CAMPA (Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority) law, which will allow about 40 thousand crores rupees (almost $6 Billion) will go to Indian states for planting trees. =Iran= Iran is considered a low forest cover region of the world with present cover approximating seven percent of the land area. This is a value reduced by an estimated six million hectares of virgin forest, which includes oak, almond and pistachio.J.A.Stanturf, 2004 Due to soil substrates, it is difficult to achieve afforestation on a large scale compared to other temperate areas endowed with more fertile and less rocky and arid soil conditions. Consequently, most of the afforestation is conducted with non-native species, leading to habitat destruction for native flora and fauna, and resulting in an accelerated loss of biodiversity.E. O. Wilson, 2002 =Israel= JNF trees in the Negev Desert. Man-made dunes (here a liman) help keep in rainwater, creating an oasis. With over 240 million planted trees, Israel is one of only two countries that entered the 21st century with a net gain in the number of trees, due to massive afforestation efforts. Most Israeli forests are the product of a major afforestation campaign by the Jewish National Fund (JNF). Critics argue that many JNF lands inside the West Bank were illegally confiscated from Palestinian refugees, and that the JNF furthermore should not be involved with lands in the West Bank.Dan Leon.\\"The Jewish National Fund: How the Land Was ‚ÄòRedeemed‚Äô: The JNF's historical concept of exclusively Jewish land is wholly anachronistic\\"; Palestine-Israel Journal, Vol 12 No. 4 & Vol 13 No. 1, 05/06 Shaul Ephraim Cohen has claimed that trees have been planted to restrict Bedouin herding.Shaul Ephraim Cohen. \\"The Politics of Planting\\"; University of Chicago (1993), p. 121. Susan Nathan wrote that forests were planted on the site of abandoned Arab villages after the 1948 war.Nathan, Susan (2005). The Other Side of Israel: My Journey Across the Jewish/Arab Divide. New York: Nan A. Talese. pp. 130‚Äì131. . Since 2009, the JNF has provided the Palestinian Authority with 3,000 tree seedlings for a forested area being developed on the edge of the new city of Rawabi, north of Ramallah. =Japan= Afforested botanical garden in Hattori Ryokuchi Park, Japan In Japan, demand for timber increased due to the construction of steelmaking fuel and large-scale castles in the Middle Ages, and forest resources decreased. As a result, forests have been planted to prevent timber resources and floods, and the Edo Shogunate enacted a law called the Liushan system, restricting the logging of timber and planting trees. The afforestation project that started after the reconstruction after World War II when large areas of forest were clear-cut for timber and to create pastures to attract immigrant farmers.Shoyama, Kikuko. \\"Reforestation of Abandoned Pasture on Hokkaido, Northern Japan: Effect of Plantations on the Recovery of Conifer- Broadleaved Mixed Forest.\\" International Consortium of Landscape Ecology and Ecological Engineering and Springer 4 (2008): 11,11-23. Print. A new management plan for the forests of Japan was instated after many pastures were abandoned and there was a recognized decline of old growth and secondary forests.Miyamoto, Asako, and Makoto Sano. \\"The Influence of Forest Management on Landscape Structure in the Cool-Temperate Forest Region of Central Japan.\\" Landscape and Urban Planning 86 (2008): 248,248-256. Print. =North Africa= Many African countries that border the Sahara desert are cooperating on the Great Green Wall project. The $8-billion project intends to restore 100 million hectares of degraded land by 2030. Also in North Africa, the Sahara Forest Project coupled with the Seawater greenhouse has been proposed. Some projects have also been launched in countries as Senegal to revert desertification. As of 2010, African leaders are discussing the combining of national resources to increase effectiveness. In addition, other projects as the Keita Project in Niger have been launched in the past, and have been able to locally revert damage done by desertification. See Development aid#Effectiveness =Turkey= As Turkey was deforested over the past few thousand years some authors refer to the restoration of these forests as \\"afforestation\\" and some \\"reforestation\\". In Turkish \\"aƒüa√ßlandƒ±rma\\" can mean either of these or \\"forestation\\". So for readability the process is all described in Reforestation#Turkey. =United States= The United States is roughly one-third covered in forest and woodland. Nevertheless, areas in the US were subject to significant tree planting. In the 1800s people moving westward encountered the Great Plains ‚Äì land with fertile soil, a growing population and a demand for timber but with few trees to supply it. So tree planting was encouraged along homesteads. Arbor Day was founded in 1872 by Julius Sterling Morton in Nebraska City, Nebraska. By the 1930s the Dust Bowl environmental disaster signified a reason for significant new tree cover. Public works programs under the New Deal saw the planting of 18,000 miles of windbreaks stretching from North Dakota to Texas to fight soil erosion (see Great Plains Shelterbelt). At their summit in Copenhagen in 2009, organised by the UK based The Climate Group, leaders of subnational governments ‚Äì states, regions and provinces ‚Äì unanimously supported a recommendation by Premier Rann to plant one billion trees across their varied jurisdictions. The initiative was strongly supported by leaders present including Quebec Premier Jean Charest, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond. At a subsequent meeting in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012, The Climate Group announced that it had already received commitments by member governments to plant more than 500 million trees. Criticism The use of afforestation as strategy of conservation of forest biomes is seen as a menace to the conservation of natural grassland and savanna biomes, as the ideal would be the reforestation of areas where forest occurs naturally.Veldman, J.W., Overbeck, G.E., Negreiros, D., Mahy, G., Le Stradic, S., Durigan, G., Buisson, E., Putz, F.E. & Bond, W.J.

Founded in March 1808 as the Pierian Sodality, the orchestra is considered by some the oldest symphony orchestra in the United States. Others dispute this because of the organization's somewhat informal beginnings (the original charter states that the intent of the Pierian Sodality is to \\"perform music for the enjoyment of others as well as serenade young women in the square\\"), and because at one point in its history, the Pierian Sodality was reduced to only one member, a flutist named Henry Gassett. As a result, some consider the New York Philharmonic the oldest American orchestra. The HRO assumed its current form as a modern symphony orchestra during the first half of the 20th century and was briefly the nation's largest collegiate orchestra. The orchestra has over 100 members, and is the largest of Harvard's orchestras. In general, only Harvard College students are eligible for membership, though this rule is not absolute and has occasionally been waived when necessary, allowing students from the other Harvard schools to participate. The orchestra plays four concerts every year in Sanders Theatre on Harvard's campus. It also sometimes gives children's concerts and regularly participates in Harvard's annual Arts First festival. Its alumni board is still known as the Pierian Sodality of 1808. From 1964 to 2009, the orchestra was led by James Yannatos, a composer and member of the music faculty. He retired after the 2008-09 school year, and Federico Cortese took over as music director on July 1, 2009. The HRO has toured various places throughout its history, including South Korea, Brazil, Washington, D.C., Mexico, Canada, Italy, Soviet Union, Asia, Europe, and most recently, Cuba. It has also performed in Carnegie Hall, and in 1978 placed third in the International Festival of Student Orchestras.

The character is commonly associated with the X-Men, and is the sister of Sunfire. Fictional character biography Leyu Yoshida and her brother Shiro were born to a mother who suffered radiation poisoning due to exposure to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Japan. As a result, she and her brother were born mutants, possessing identical powers. Her brother would go on to be the well-known Japanese superhero Sunfire. Leyu first appeared, during the Eve of Destruction storyline, when she joined the X-Men for a single mission, to help fight Magneto. Jean Grey had summoned her brother, but instead got Sunpyre, who she says Shiro had never even mentioned before, as Shiro had refused because he was unavailable at the time. Despite Jean not knowing Sunpyre at all, she easily accepts her offered assistance as the situation was so extreme.Uncanny X-Men #392 Jean's makeshift team of X-Men consists of long-term allies Northstar and Dazzler. There were also civilians Omerta and Wraith.Uncanny X-Men #393 Dazzler had problems of her own and with a Jean-assisted telepathic conference, Sunpyre learns of the childlike Age of Apocalypse villains. Thus, Sunprye is one of the few in current continuity to have any idea the Age of Apocalypse actually had happened. Sunpyre fights valiantly against Magneto, but almost loses her life when the master of magnetism constructs a metallic cocoon around her. After the mission was completed successfully, Sunpyre chose to return to her home instead of stay in the United States with the \\"arrogant\\" X-Men.X-Men #113 Banshee later requests her to join his X-Corps (again replacing Sunfire, who did not want to join). This time she was removed from the front lines and instead spent most of her time in the laboratory studying the mutant Abyss. No explanation was provided for the fifteen-year-old's sudden expertise in mutant genetics.http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix6/sunpyreyoshida.htm When Mystique, who had infiltrated the group and brought together the other former villains, began her plan for taking over the X-Corps, Sunpyre was one of the casualties. Mystique stabs her to death. When Banshee finds her corpse, he is also stabbed but he survives his wounds. Mystique had wanted to release Abyss, but she got more than she bargained for when the mutant was unable to turn off his powers and sucked the shapeshifter into the dimensional void in his chest cavity. Sunpyre was later apparently resurrected as a female East Asian mutant who looks exactly just like her (even complete with her signature flame aura) was most recently seen with other former X-Men and X-Men-related characters in Cyclops's Million Mutant March in Washington D.C.Uncanny Xmen #600 Powers and abilities Sunpyre had powers similar to those of her brother, Sunfire. She could convert solar and some other ambient energy into ionized plasma similar to the sun's, which she could use to fire blasts of heat and flame, surround herself with an aura of solar-powered fire, and fly close to by riding convection currents created by superheating the surrounding air with her aura of flames. This plasma, while surrounding her, also provided protection against energy and physical attacks. Also, she was resistant to most forms of radiation, and could see heat by attuning her eyes to the infrared wavelength of the light wave. Other versions An extra-dimensional Sunpyre, who was a princess on her own homeworld in the Microverse, later appeared as part of Big Hero 6 in Alpha Flight vol. 3 #9. Teammate Honey Lemon pulled Sunpyre out of Lemon's Power Purse, resulting in Sunpyre worshipping Honey Lemon as a goddess and Sunpyre joining the team. Sunpyre and Ebon Samurai were both created to fill in the void left by Sunfire and Silver Samurai, who were being used elsewhere at the time. This version of Sunpyre is not on the current Big Hero 6 roster, as she has returned to reclaim her throne with the help of her teammate and current-retainer, the undead Ebon Samurai. Scott Lobdell clarified the relationship of Honey Lemon and Sunpyre in the Marvel Teams Handbook 2005. This Sunpyre retained her powers during M-Day. However, this Sunpyre's powers were not mutant in nature, but rather powers inherent to her extra-dimensional Coronarian race.

Initially performed by Drew Massey, and later puppeteered by Allan Trautman to Terri Hardin's voice. Reception In the weeks after its debut, The Puzzle Place won a great deal of acclaim and \\"enjoyed an average audience-per-viewing second only to Barney and Friends among shows in the popular PBS daily children's block.\\" It received a citation of excellence from UNIMA-USA for its use of puppetry. In 1997, ten more episodes of the show were \\"in the works\\". Toys \\"R\\" Us, Sears, and Payless ShoeSource all announced that they would carry merchandising from the series and showcase that merchandise in its own separate \\"boutique\\" rather than integrating it with the other products.

Description Depictions of the mapinguari vary. Sometimes it is described as a hairy humanoid cyclops, while others claim it to be similar to the giant ground sloth, an animal extinct for thousands of years, but which some believe the mapinguari to be a cultural memory of. The creature is often said to have a gaping mouth on its abdomen (a feature of course not shared by ground sloths or other real mammals).

Klehr and Ronald Radosh, The Amerasia Spy Case: Prelude to McCarthyism (Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 1996) , p. 21 and as belonging to the Soviet spy group known as the Silvermaster ring. Birth, education, and career Born in 1907 in Richmond, Virginia, he attended public schools in Tennessee, Alabama, and Chicago. He attended the University of Chicago, earning his bachelor of philosophy in 1926 and continuing graduate work into 1928. From 1928 to 1930, he was a member of the staff of the Johns Hopkins University Institute of Law, returning to the University of Chicago as a research assistant and to write his thesis from 1930 to 1933. From 1933 to 1934, he was a member of the staff of the Brookings Institution. In the summer of 1934, he was a consultant in the Office of the Secretary of the Treasury Department; in the summer of 1936 and spring-summer 1939, he was again a consultant at the Treasury. From the autumn of 1934 until the spring of 1939, he taught economics at the University of Toronto, remaining a member of its staff on leave for several years thereafter (in his testimony, Coe says \\"4, 5, or 6 years\\"). Beginning in 1939, he worked adviser to Paul McNutt, then head of the Federal Security Agency, and in 1940 as assistant to Leon Henderson in the Office of Price Administration (then known as the National Defense Council). Late in 1940, he returned to the Treasury Department as an assistant director of monetary research, where he stayed for about a year, during which he was special assistant to the United States Ambassador in England. In 1942, he became Executive Secretary of the Joint War Production Committee of the United States and Canada and an assistant to the Executive Director of the Board of Economic Warfare (later renamed the Foreign Economic Administration). In late 1944/early 1945, Coe was named Director of the Division of Monetary Research in the Treasury Department, serving as technical secretary at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire in 1944, he accepted a position as Secretary of the International Monetary Fund in 1946, his successor at Treasury being Harold Glasser.His position as Secretary was often misunderstood by McCarthy and other Members of Congress to indicate that he had some say in policy. The Secretary's main duties, as Coe testified in 1953, are presiding over Board meetings, preparing the minutes, and distributing documents appropriately. See http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bl/rr03.htm. Coe resigned from the Fund in December 1952 after public calls were made by Congress for his ouster. The IMF announced his resignation on December 3, 1952.Belair, Jr., Felix. \\"WORLD FUND OUSTS AIDE WHO BALKED AT RED, SPY QUERIES; Coe Quits on Request  House Unit Looks Into Jury's Charge U. N.

Accessed July 1, 2008. \\"The International Monetary Fund announced today the dismissal of its secretary, Frank Coe, who refused last Monday to tell Senate investigators in New York whether he was now or had ever been a Communist or subversive agent taking orders from Communists.\\" Allegations and evidence of espionage The evidence against Coe stems from his being named by two defected spies and ex post examinations of his career. In 1939, former Communist underground courier Whittaker Chambers named Coe to then-Assistant Secretary of State Adolf Berle as a communist sympathizer who was providing information to the Ware group. In 1948, former NKVD courier Elizabeth Bentley, testifying before the House Un-American Activities Committee, mentioned Coe, whom she remembered as one of several important Treasury officials who passed on information to Silvermaster.Gabrick, Robert, and Klehr, Harvey, Communism, Espionage, and the Cold War, Los Angeles: UCLA Press, p.15\\"Man of Bretton Woods,\\" Time, December 15, 1952 Called before the HUAC (chaired by Congressman Karl Mundt), Coe denied under oath having ever been a member of the Communist Party USA. Subsequently, he was questioned intensely in the IMF about his activities, but he was not sanctioned or removed from his duties.United States Congress. Senate. Austrian incident. Hearings before the Permanent subcommittee on investigations of the Committee on government operations, United States Senate, 83d Cong., 1st sess., pursuant to S. Res. 40 a resolution authorizing the Committee on government operations to employ temporary additional personnel and increasing the limit of expenditures. May 29, June 5 and 8, 1953 (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1953); J. Keith Horsefield, The International Monetary Fund, 1945-1965 (Washington: International Monetary Fund), vol. 1, pp. 339-40 In late 1952, he was called before a Grand Jury in New York (presided over by Senator Herbert O'Conor) and then before the McCarran Committee on December 1, 1952, both of which were investigating alleged Communist affiliations of U.S. citizens working for the United Nations and other international organizations. On the latter occasion, he declined to answer the question of whether he was a member of the Communist Party on Fifth Amendment grounds, citing the example of Alger Hiss's conviction for perjury. His final appearance before McCarthy's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) came on June 5 and 8, 1953, chaired by then Senator Karl Mundt. Nominally, the investigation was into interference with negotiations to devalue the Austrian schilling in November 1949 as the Soviets had apparently been profiting from the black market. U.S. officials with the European Cooperation Administration (the Marshall Plan aid agency) reported that a command came via a tickertape telecon to break off negotiations at the last minute. The telecon, which was with an anonymous person at the State Department, cited Coe in his capacity as Secretary of the IMF as the source of the order. (In truth, the devaluation had been discussed by and was supported by the Executive Board of the IMF.) The PSI ascertained that Coe could not have been the source of the communication as he was in the Middle East at the time,Testimony from H. Merle Cochran, Acting Managing Director, IMF, in Austrian Incident, op. cit., p. 71 and quickly turned to investigating Coe's alleged Communist activities. Coe, who consulted constantly with his lawyer Milton S. Friedman, maintained his Fifth-Amendment plea, stating at one point that he did not want to see the blacklist extended to include those who had helped him in his search for work.Austrian Incident, op. cit., p. 65. The subsequent report of the Senate Sub-Committee on Internal Security stated: \\"Coe refused to answer, on the grounds that the answers might incriminate him, all questions as to whether he was a Communist, whether he was engaged in subversive activities, or whether he was presently a member of a Soviet espionage ring. He refused for the same reason to answer whether he was a member of an espionage ring while Technical Secretary of the Bretton Woods Conference, whether he ever had had access to confidential Government information or security information, whether he had been associated with the Institute of Pacific Relations, or with individuals named on a long list of people associated with that organization.(Activities of United States Citizens Employed by the United Nations, report of Senate Sub-Committee on Internal Security, Jan. 2, 1953, p.7; also see hearings and report of this Sub- Committee on the Institute of Pacific Relations.) Regarding his policy actions, it is often mentioned that Coe, together with Assistant Treasury Secretary Harry Dexter White and Treasury economist Solomon Adler, opposed President Franklin Roosevelt's gold loan program of $200 million to help the Nationalist Chinese Government stabilize its currency in 1943. However, White's documents indicate while he favored giving economic assistance, he had concerns that cash assistance might be misused or fall into enemy hands.J.M. Boughton, \\"The Case Against Harry Dexter White: Still Not Proven,\\" IMF Working Paper 00/149 Arlington Hall cryptographers identified the Soviet agent designated \\"Peak\\" in the Venona project as \\"possibly\\" Coe, but there is no clear reason for the identification. (One secondary source suggests it was because there was no additional information on Peak.Boughton, op. cit.) The decrypt in question reports that five reels of Peak's documents concerning U.S.-British Lend-Lease negotiations were en route to Moscow.Herbert Romerstein and Stanislav Levchenko, The KGB Against the \\"Main Enemy\\": How the Soviet Intelligence Service Operates Against the United States (Lexington, Mass.: Lexington Books, 1989) , pp. 106‚Äì08; John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1999) , p. 345; Allen Weinstein and Alexander Vassiliev, The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in AmericaThe Stalin Era (New York: Modern Library, 2000) ), pp. 48, 158, 162, 169, 229 A recent investigation into the KGB archives claims that files show Coe to have been a Soviet agent.Allen Weinstein and Alexander Vassiliev, The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America - The Stalin Era (New York: Random House, 1999) However, the authors do not quote or reproduce the documents in question and at least one scholar argues that their testimony should be suspended until the primary sources become available. Later career Coe was Blacklisted, the US denied his passport (in late 1949) and prevented Coe from traveling to neighboring countries (June 1953) due to his ties to Soviet espionage. Coe sought work abroad, eventually finding a sponsor in the People's Republic of China, where he joined a circle of expatriates working with the government. In 1962, he was joined by Solomon Adler in the circle. Coe participated in Mao's disastrous Great Leap Forward, a plan for the rapid industrialization and modernization of China, which in fact resulted in millions of deaths. Coe sought works included articles justifying the Rectification campaign.Becker, Jasper, Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine, Macmillan (1998), , , pp. 290-299Epoch Times Staff, Nine Commentaries on the Communist Party, The Epoch Group, Broad Book USA (2005), , , p. 47 Death Coe died in Beijing, China on June 2, 1980. The New China News Agency listed the cause of his death as a pulmonary embolism and indicated that government officials visited him often during his illness. His brother indicated that he had undergone surgery for cancer eight months earlier.The New York Times, op. cit., June 6, 1980, D15:4.
