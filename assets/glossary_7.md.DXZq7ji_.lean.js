Awards and fellowships She has received the following fellowships from various international organisations. * NSA-JSPS Bilateral Exchange Fellow, Miyazaki University, Japan (2012). * INSA-DFG International Exchange Fellow, Hamburg University, Germany (2008). * DST-DAAD Exchange Fellow, University of Wuerzberg, Germany (1999‚Äì2003). * INSA Exchange Fellowship, Czech Academy of Sciences, Czech Republic (2000). * Indo-German Exchange Programme Fellow, University T√ºbingen, Germany (1991). Research Highlights She is an outstanding teacher and well-known researcher in the field of insect biology and has served the University of Hyderabad with distinction for more than 35 years. She primarily works on an economically important group of insects which include a large number of stored grain and agricultural pests. Her studies using biochemical and molecular tools have unraveled the developmental and hormonal regulation of various genes, their proteins and the specific physiological processes in insects. Her research revolves around (i) fat body hexamerin gene expression and their hormonal regulation during the postembryonic development, (ii) membrane receptor mediated sequestration of hexamerins by various tissues and their role in immunity, reproduction, silk secretion and during the metamorphosis, (iii) identification of novel candidates with immune function, (iv) identification and characterization of Bacillus thuringiensis Cry toxin binding receptors in larval midgut and other visceral tissues and (v) deciphering the basis for the development of resistance against Bt toxins in various lepidopteran insects. Her group has identified several candidate genes and their corresponding proteins, which could be exploited either for delivering or targeting molecules and/or growth regulators, which disrupt insect development and reproduction.

She died in 2007 as a result of brain cancer. Shipra Guha Mukharji the woman scientist who was behind the breakthrough discovery of \\"The technique of production of haploid plants through anther culture.\\"  Early life and education  Shipra Guha-Mukherjee was born in Kolkata on 13 July 1938. She did her schooling in Bombay and Delhi and joined Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi for her BSc Botany (Hons) in 1954. She remained in Jawaharlal Nehru University, first as student and then as professor and researcher, for more than 30 years. She completed her MSc from there as well. She then went on to do her PhD under Prof. B. M. Johri on the tissue culture of an onion and completed her PhD at 1963 (Allium cepa). She is quoted as saying: > \\"I decided to study botany because it was my favorite subject in school. As > a school student I was awed by the contribution of Sir Jagadish Chandra > Bose, and fascinated by his work that showed that plants were living > organisms and had a metabolism similar to that of animals. His hypothesis > that ascent of sap in plants is due to pulsatory activity of an inner layer > of cortical cells (a theory no longer tenable) infused a huge excitement in > me, as earlier I used to think that plants were inert objects which could > never respond to any external stimuli. As a student in classes five and six, > I developed a strong determination to find the locations of the ‚Äúheart‚Äù and > ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of plants and to understand the way they functioned.\\"  Research and career  She was professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi. Her field of specialization was plant tissue culture, plant molecular biology, biotechnology and cell biology. After her PhD, Guha-Mukherjee joined the lab of S. C. Maheshwari as a postdoctoral fellow, where she did her most significant work. Between 1964 and 1966, she discovered the technique of production of haploid pollen plants through anther culture using Datura innoxia as the culture material, which has been published in the journal In Vitro Cellular & Developmental Biology. This work led to the establishment of techniques of culture of young ovules and ovaries. This technique has also been used as an additional tool for obtaining improved varieties of rice, wheat, potato and other crops. She has also worked on regeneration of plants and mechanism of regeneration involving various enzymes, membrane phospholipids and second messengers during her time at the School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi. Guha-Mukherjee then went to the US in late 1966 and worked with R. S. Bandurski at the Department of Botany and Plant Pathology as a research associate at Michigan State University. Between 1970 and 1972 she served as an assistant professor in the Biology Department at West Virginia University and later at the well-known MSU/DOE Plant Research Laboratory when Anton Lang and Joe Varner were there. After her return to India, Shipra Guha-Mukherjee collaborated with M. S. Swaminathan for raising haploids in rice. Then she returned to Jawaharlal Nehru University to join the new Life Science Faculty as one of its founding internet. She was promoted to full professor in 1979 and served as the dean of life sciences between 1993 and 1995. She also served as member of the task force and scientific advisory committee, Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, and also on the board of the University Grants Commission. Shipra Guha- Mukherjee was an expert in plant tissue culture, haploids and plant biotechnology.  Awards and recognition  Shipra Guha-Mukherjee has received the Senior National Bio-scientist Award, the Om Prakash Bhasin Foundation Award in Biotechnology and the Kanishka Award from the Lion's Club.

Geologists attribute this to hydrogen sulfide seeping from the caldera bottom, forming sulfuric acid in the lake water. Due to its acidity, the lake is home to only one subspecies of Japanese dace, along with several insect species. However, the lake is a noted spot for waterfowl.

Many are dark in color, but they can be red, orange, or pale. They have cyclostome mouthparts and females usually have a long ovipositor. They are found worldwide, but are most diverse in the Paleotropical region.  Biology  Braconines are idiobiont ectoparasitoids of concealed larvae. The hosts of most species are Lepidoptera or Coleoptera, with a few attacking Diptera or Symphyta. Usually, they paralyze the host with venom before laying one or more (depending on the species) large eggs on the host's exterior.

A bullet trap (or pellet trap when used specifically for air guns) is a device to stop and collect projectiles fired at a shooting range to prevent overpenetrations and stray shots. Bullet traps typically use friction, impact or gradual deceleration to stop bullets. The bullet trap may also provide means to recycle bullet materials and/or prevent release of toxic heavy metals (such as lead dust from fragmented bullets) from the shooting range. Some bullet traps include a negative- pressure system to filter dust from air within the impact zone and/or capture area.  Deceleration traps  Deceleration-type bullet traps direct bullets into a helical or circular chamber in which the bullet will slide against the curved chamber wall until it gradually loses velocity from friction and drops to the bottom of the chamber, where it can be later collected. For use with multiple firing positions, the helical chamber often resembles a horizontal pipe, into which bullets are directed by upper and lower steel plates. The upper plate slopes downward and the lower plate slopes upward to a horizontal slot in the side of the helical chamber. Alternatively, some narrow deceleration traps for single firing positions employ vertical plates to direct bullets into a helical deceleration chamber resembling a vertical pipe from which spent bullets drop out the lower end. Lightweight versions suitable for capturing airgun pellets are often used behind electronic scoring systems on ranges configured for ISSF 10 metre airgun events. The plate slopes are shallow (about 18¬∞ ) so bullets may be deflected relatively intact rather than disintegrated upon impact. Some deceleration traps use an oil and/or water coating to reduce friction and capture dust.  Impact traps  Impact bullet trap into sand. Impact-type bullet traps typically use vertical or angled 500 Brinell scale steel plate at least thick for centrefire cartridges. Plate thickness of may be adequate for rimfire ammunition. Sloping plates deflect bullets downward into sand, water or some other capture material; but the plate angle is often steep enough to largely disintegrate the bullet upon initial impact, and bullets are expected to disintegrate upon impacting vertical plates to prevent dangerous backward ricochets. Shooter protection for firing positions within of the impact plate may require an anti-splash curtain of Linatex¬Æ or similar self-healing material hung in front of the plate to contain any fragments of ‚Äúback splash‚Äù as well as dust. Rifle bullets may be partially melted by the energy of bullet impact. The spray of molten metal may solidify as dust, and soft lead bullets often leave a smear of lead upon impacting the steel plate. Smeared metal may be converted to additional airborne dust by subsequent bullet impact. The popularity of vertical plate installations for indoor ranges is largely down to their minimal footprint compared with sand, granular or helical bullet traps and can consume less than of a room‚Äôs available length‚Äîcomprising the thickness of the steel plate, the thickness of the anti-splash curtain and 10 to 11 inches of air gap between. However, sloping steel plates will tend to wear less quickly‚Äîparticularly on precision target ranges where fixed targets result in fire being concentrated into small areas. In such cases, small sloping plates or sacrificial vertical wear plates may be placed behind the targets as the primary bullet trap, whilst a large vertical plate covers the remainder of the wall as the defence zone to catch errant shots. The small plates can be easily changed as frequently as necessary whilst the main back wall will need little maintenance from occasional scattered fire.  Friction traps  Earthen berm friction bullet trap Friction bullet traps slow and capture the bullet more gently than steel plates. This allows more effective capture of contaminants and reduces the production of dust as well as allowing for the capture of higher energy projectiles which would wear an impact trap too quickly and necessitate uneconomical levels of maintenance. The most common form of friction trap is a berm of granular material such as sand; earth or granulated rubber. In some circumstances a wall of railway ties, intact vehicle tires or blocks of shock- attenuating concrete (SACON) or other proprietary materials may be used. SACON is a fiber-reinforced concrete substituting expanded polystyrene beads for gravel aggregate. For ISSF 50 metre rifle events, individual bullet traps comprising a metal box filled with plastic beads are often used behind the electronic scoring systems used for such events. Such systems require less space than earthen berms whilst being quieter than steel impact or deceleration traps, which can be a significant consideration for urban outdoor range complexes. Individual bullet traps of this nature would typically be backed by a concrete wall to protect from negligent discharges or mechanical failures causing a bullet to miss the target entirely but which is not expected to be struck during the course of normal firing. Intact vehicle tyres are generally only suitable for higher energy projectiles which will easily penetrate their surface. Handgun bullets and shotgun pellets may ricochet back. Granulated rubber (often from shredded tires) is a convenient capture material from which bullets may be separated by gravity during agitation by subsequent bullet impact.

They have produced work for 20th Century Fox, Walt Disney Television Animation and Cartoon Network.  History  In 2002, Grasshorse began as a sole proprietorship with Jennings working on shows including Craig McCracken‚Äôs The Powerpuff Girls for Cartoon Network, Warner Bros.' Johnny Test, Genndy Tartakovsky‚Äôs Star Wars: Clone Wars and Megas XLR. Jennings pioneered 2D 3D hybrid animation techniques on The Powerpuff Girls; he was one of the first to mash the aesthetics of 2D animation with 3D animation in broadcast television. In 2007, the studio was relocated to Iowa by siblings Kathy Buxton and Steve Jennings and expanded with the goal of competing with international studios in quality and budget. Soon after, Grasshorse partnered with Southeastern Community College (Iowa) in creating a Character animation program. After three years in the writing and planning of the curriculum its first classes began in Fall, 2011. Jennings and Buxton continue to serve on the board of SCC's animation program.

Career  Born in Meran, Ellmenreich made her stage debut as Marguerite in Gounod's Faust in 1908 at the Hoftheater (Court theatre) in Stuttgart. She was a member of the company from 1909 to 1924. It was named W√ºrttembergisches Landestheater from 1918, and later Staatstheater (State theatre). She appeared as a guest artist, for example in 1910 at the Cologne Opera and in 1916 at the Frankfurt Opera. In Stuttgart, Ellmenreich took part in numerous premieres. On 25 October 1912 she appeared as Echo in Ariadne auf Naxos by Richard Strauss. The production was part of the opening festivities for the new theatre building, staged in the Kleines Haus (small hall) by Max Reinhardt, with Maria Jeritza in the title role. In 1917 Ellmenreich performed the part of the M√§rchenfrau in Siegfried Wagner's fairy-tale opera An allem ist H√ºtchen schuld!, and in 1919 in Ture Rangstr√∂m's Die Kronbraut (Kronbruden) after a play by August Strindberg. On 4 June 1921 she appeared in two roles in one-act operas by Paul Hindemith, the Woman in M√∂rder, Hoffnung der Frauen (Murderer, Hope of Women) after a play by Oskar Kokoschka, and the Empress Bangsa in Das Nusch-Nuschi. The first presentation of the two short operas by Hindemith, conducted by Fritz Busch and with Oskar Schlemmer responsible for stage, costumes and choreography, caused a scandal. Ellmenreich's operatic parts included Mozart's Cherubino in Le nozze di Figaro and Dorabella in Cos√¨ fan tutte, and Silla in Hans Pfitzner's Palestrina. She performed the title roles of Mignon by Ambroise Thomas and Bizet's Carmen, of both Der Rosenkavalier and Salome by Strauss, and Puccini's Madama Butterfly. After leaving the Stuttgart opera, Ellmenreich performed as a guest artist. She also had a career as a concert singer. She died in Berlin.

In 2004, as the ATV station started broadcasting 24 hours a day, the program was cancelled, 25 April 2004 being the last-time it was aired in ATV World. In February 2011, Telefishion was aired again for a short time, broadcast in the morning. However, this TV program was cancelled in May 2011.

Unlike other similar orchids, E. pusilla never develops lengthwise folded leaves (conduplicate leaves) or extra storage organs (pseudobulbs). The blooming season is from fall to spring. It produces solitary light-yellow orchid-shaped flowers. In comparison to the overall plant size, these flowers can reach a relatively large size (1 to 2.5 cm). The lateral sepals are united near the flower base. Compared to other orchids, E. pusilla has a short life cycle (about 17 months). It can reach adulthood in just one season, while the majority of the orchids reach maturity in up to 5 years. Name It is commonly known as the tiny psygmorchis, due to its miniature size. The current scientific name is Erycina pusilla. The etymology of its scientific name refers to its beauty and tiny size: ‚ÄúErycina‚Äù is a byname of the Roman goddess for beauty, Venus (Venus of Eryx), and ‚Äúpusilla‚Äù is Latin meaning ‚Äúvery little‚Äù. It was formerly classified in the genus Psygmorchis, due to its fan-shaped leaves (‚Äúpsygmos‚Äù Greek for fan). =Synonyms= Homotypic Synonyms: * Epidendrum pusillum L., Sp.

Distribution and habitat  Erycina pusilla can be found in the neotropical region, including South and Central America, the southern Mexican lowlands, the Caribbean islands and southern Florida. Its habitat consists of humid forests at elevations of with temperatures varying from warm to hot. Like many orchids, E. pusilla grows harmlessly upon other plants. It gets moisture and nutrients from the surroundings without affecting the host plant (commensalism). Its quick development permits this orchid to grow on relatively short-lasting sites such as twigs or even leaves of bushes and trees, such as coffee plant or hibiscus. For this reason, it is usually classified as a twig epiphyte.  Use in science  Erycina pusilla is a promising model candidate for Oncidium research. Its relatively tiny size and its short life cycle, facilitates its cultivation. Additionally, it has the ability to complete its life cycle in vitro.\\"IN VITRO FRUITING AND SEED PRODUCTION IN ERYCINA PUSILLA.\\" http://journal- pop.org/References/Vol_11_3(131-136).pdf The functional genomic research is easier because E. pusilla only has 6 chromosomes\\"Chromosome analysis in Psygmorchis pusilla (L.) Dodson & Dressier\\" http://www.caryologia.unifi.it/past_volumes/52_3_4/9.pdf. and a small genome size (1.5 pg 1C nucleus). Another aspect that speaks for the use of this orchid in research, is the rare pollination and production of seeds in nature.http://www.tropecol.com/pdf/open/PDF_48_1/Damon_n_Pedro.pdf This reduces the risk of undesired propagation of transgenic lines. The rapid growth and the low chromosome numbers make E. pusilla is also an excellent parent for traditional hybridization methods. All these characteristics make E. pusilla a promising model not only for research, but also for commercial breeding, since it constitutes an excellent parent for traditional hybridization methods. Beyond the use of this orchid for research and commercial purposes, E. pusilla has also medical applications. The ingestion of whole plant cooked treats colic and stomachache. Additionally, the whole plant boiled is also used as a wash to treat lacerations cuts and wounds. = In vitro cultivation = Sporadic flowering in flasks was first reported by Livingston (1962), although the in vitro cultivation was just established (2007). The primary culture of E. pusilla becomes a callus after about one month of cultivation. Three months later it reaches leaf stage and after eight months the flowering stage begins. After two and half months E. pusilla produces fruits. A new cycle can start from a new primary culture: protocorm- like body (PLB) in vitro. = Genome = The transcriptome sequence of E. pusilla is available (Orchidstra Database). Some basic molecular resources were also established, including the sequencing of the chloroplast genome, the transcriptome and the BAC library. The miRNA database of E. pusilla, including the identification of miRNA biosynthesis-related genes and miRNA families, was established in 2013. The chloroplast genome has been sequenced efficiently and economically by using BAC library and next-generation sequencing. The chloroplast genome of E. pusilla is 143.164 bp in size, which contains a pair of inverted repeats (IRa and IRb) of 23.439 bp separated by large and small single copy regions of 84.189 and 12.097 bp, respectively. From these result compare to Oncidium, the gene order of chloroplast genome between E. pusilla and Oncidium are similar. In Taiwan, different hybridization compatibility of E. pusilla with Oncidium, Rodriguezia and Tolumnia was found by crossing with several important Oncidiinae orchids. = MADS-box genes = Due to their role in plant growth, the characterization of MADS-box genes in E. pusilla has turned into a hot topic for both researchers and commercial orchid breeders. MADS-box genes encode for MADS-domain proteins, which are generally transcription factors. In plants, these proteins control key developmental processes throughout almost all life stages. To date, 28 MADS-box genes were isolated in E. pusilla, namely EpMADS1 to 28. Nearly all of them contain introns greater than 10 kb, which reflects the complexity of the E. pusilla genome. Many EpMADS genes have expression patterns similar to those MADS-box genes in Arabidopsis. The 28 proteins, encoded by the E. pusilla MADS-box genes, are classified as type I or type II based on BLASTP analyses.

He became a Bolshevik and after the February Revolution led a detachment that helped organize the Ice Cruise of the Baltic Fleet. After falling ill in 1918, Kireyev spent the Russian Civil War on land in various party roles and in the 1920s successively served on the revolutionary military councils of the Black Sea Fleet and the Baltic Fleet. After graduating from the Naval Academy of the Red Army he became commander of the Caspian Flotilla and then assistant Pacific Fleet commander. Kireyev moved up to command the fleet itself after the beginning of the Great Purge in July 1937. He was arrested in January 1938 and executed in late July. Kireyev was posthumously rehabilitated (acquitted) in 1956.  Early life  Kireyev was born on 2 February 1890 in Lyudinovo in Kaluga Governorate to a working-class family. After graduating from the Bezhitsa Vocational School, he worked at the Lyudinovo Locomotive Factory. In 1911, Kireyev was drafted into the Imperial Russian Navy. He was initially assigned to the 1st Baltic Naval Crew.  World War I and Russian Civil War  During World War I he served as a ship's mechanic in the Baltic Fleet, becoming a non-commissioned officer. After the February Revolution Kireyev was elected chairman of the Helsingfors Sailors' Club and a member of the Helsingfors Soviet of Deputies, in which he led the Sailors' section. Simultaneously, Kireyev was commissar of a detachment of sailors guarding Baltic Fleet property in Finland. From February to August, he led the Special Detachment of the Baltic Fleet Council of Commissars, among whose tasks was to organize the Ice Cruise of the Baltic Fleet, its evacuation from Helsingfors to Kronstadt ahead of German invasion forces. During the summer of 1918, Kireyev fell ill and returned to Lyudinovo. Upon his recovery, Kireyev was elected chairman of the Bryansk City Council. He subsequently edited the provincial newspaper and worked in party and government organizations. In Bryansk, he married Anna Ivanovna Ivanyuta. In January 1921, he was elected chairman of the Sevsky Uyezd Executive Committee. In August he became the second secretary of the Bryansk Governorate Party Committee. As a member of Forces of Special Purpose (CHON), responsible for assisting the local Soviet government in maintaining Soviet power, Kireyev participated in the suppression of anti-Soviet uprisings in Bryansk, Sevsk, and Dmitrovsk Uyezds. At the end of 1921, Kireyev was transferred to Siberia to become a member of the Krasnoyarsk Governorate Party Committee.  Interwar  In 1923 he was transferred to political work in the Soviet Navy. In January 1923, Kireyev became a member of the Black Sea Fleet's Revolutionary Military Council. He became a member of the Baltic Fleet's Revolutionary Military Council in January 1926. In 1927 he graduated from the Courses of Improvement for Higher Officers (KUVNAS) at the Naval Academy. Kireyev became part-time head of the Baltic Fleet's Political Directorate in July 1928, and in this position participated in the Soviet Navy's cruise around Europe between November 1929 and 1930, which transferred the battleship Parizhskaya Kommuna and cruiser Profintern from the Baltic Fleet to the Black Sea Fleet. Between 1931 and 1933, Kireyev was a student in the special courses at the Naval Academy. After graduating, he took command of the Caspian Flotilla. In 1933, he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. In October 1933, Kireyev became assistant commander of the Naval Forces in the Far East, which in 1935 became the Soviet Pacific Fleet. In 1935, Kireyev was awarded the Order of Lenin and in the same year he was made a Fleet Flag Officer 1st Rank when the Soviet Armed Forces introduced ranks. In July 1937, he became commander of the Pacific Fleet after Mikhail Viktorov became commander in chief of the Navy.  The Great Purge and Death  As a result of the call to extend the then- ongoing Great Purge to the armed forces, during the fall of 1937, Army Commissar 1st Rank Pyotr Smirnov led a working group to purge the Pacific Fleet of \\"Wreckers\\" and \\"enemies of the people.\\" Smirnov used forced confessions from those previously arrested to implicate more officers and create the appearance of a conspiracy in the fleet. After being summoned to Moscow, Kireyev was arrested on 10 January 1938. He was sentenced to death and executed at the Kommunarka shooting ground on 29 July 1938 on charges of participation in a \\"military conspiracy\\", sabotaging the Pacific Fleet, and spying for Japanese intelligence, along with Viktorov and the rest of the fleet's high-ranking officers.

He holds a doctor of philosophy degree in theological studies from the University of Birmingham (2002) and a master of theology in applied theology from Regents Theological College. He is the last of the Apostles who walked with the founder of The Church of Pentecost, Pastor James McKeown. Onyinah joined the ministry of The Church of Pentecost in 1976 and has served in various positions, including rector of Pentecost University College, an executive council member and the first International Missions Director of the church. He is also an adjunct lecturer at the Pentecost Theological Seminary. Onyinah served as a member of National Peace Council in Ghana, the president of the Ghana Pentecostal and Charismatic Council from 2011 to 2019, chairman of the Ghana Evangelism Committee from 2010 to date, co-chairman of Empowered21 Africa from 2013 to date, advisory board member of International Review of Mission since 2013, member of the Committee of World Pentecostal Theologians in Dialogue with the Catholic Church since 2011, member of a standing committee of Health and Healing of World Council of Churches/DIFAM, 2005‚Äì2010, member of the Commission on World Mission and Evangelism of World Council of Churches since 2007, and a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Pentecostal Theology since 2007. Early life and education Opoku Onyinah was born to Opanin Kwame Onyinah and Maame Rebecca Akosua Addai of Aduman about 7:00 am in a local maternity home in the town. As per Akan tradition, he was named after his grand-uncle, a popular chief of Dwumakyi village called Opanin Nimfour. He grew up with the name \\"Koofour\\" an abridged form of Kwadwo Nimfour. 22 July was adopted as his official birthday though his Catholic Baptism Certificate bears 24 July as his birthday. He started his basic education at Yamfo Presbyterian Primary School and completed Middle Form Four at Yamfo Catholic Middle School. He was trained in carpentry and joinery in Sunyani Technical and Tamale Technical Institutes. His calling into pastoral ministry in 1976 enabled him to acquire a master of theology in applied theology in 1998 and Philosophy in Theological Studies from University of Birmingham in 2002. Onyinah's was promoted as an associate professor in 2016. In response this promotion, a citation in honor written by the current general secretary of The Church of Pentecost, Apostle Alexander Nana Yaw Kumi-Larbi states: ‚ÄúIt is with great honor and pleasure that we officially announce the promotion of the Chairman of The Church of Pentecost, Apostle Dr. Opoku Onyinah, to the academic rank of an Associate Professor.‚Äù ‚Äì By Aps. Alexander N. Y. A.Kumi-Larbi\\" Employment and full-time ministry Onyinah was employed by the State Construction Company as a regional estimator before his call into the full-time ministry of The Church of Pentecost in 1976. His first ministerial station was a district overseer to Wa District from 1976 to 1981 in the Northern Region. Then transferred to Kumasi as district pastor from 1981 to 1984, He served as Ashanti regional head from 1984 to 1986, he left Ghana to London, UK, for further studies from 1986 to 1988. His return to Ghana saw him appointed as the Koforidua regional head from 1988 to 1991, he became the first international missions director for the church from 1991 to 1996, he continued theological studies at London-UK from 1996 to 2002, he was appointed principal to Pentecost Bible College, which subsequently upgraded to Pentecost University College as its first rector from 2002 to 2008 and finally as chairman of The Church of Pentecost-Worldwide from 2008 to 2018. Chairmanship Onyinah was elected the chairman of The Church of Pentecost in 2008 succeeded Apostle Michael Ntumy through election. He won 2/3 of the vote cast. The chairmanship comes along with critical responsibilities. As a chairman, Apostle Onyinah performs the following functions: * Chairs the executive council and the general council meetings * Ex-officio member of every board and committee of the church * Chairs every meeting, convention or rally he attends * Directs action on issues and correspondence pertaining to missionaries and external branches * Chairman of the Missions Board * Assigns to the general secretary and the international missions director such duties as he deems necessary * Responsible for appointing an acting general secretary or international missions director from among the executive council members, or apostles and prophets during the short absence of the general secretary or the international missions director not exceeding six months * Takes decisions and actions with any area head where disciplinary or other action is urgently required in an area and afterwards reports to the executive council * Organizes retreats, seminars, and prayer sessions for National/Area Heads and Ministers * Issues pastoral and circular letters as and when he deems necessary * Confers with the general secretary and the international missions director on matters concerning government and outside bodies * Gives a formal address on the state of the church at every general council meeting He was re- elected in the 40th general council meeting held at the Pentecost Convention Centre at Gomoa Fetteh in the Central Region. He obtained 77.3% of vote cast at the council meeting, which enabled him a five-year leadership mandate. Onyinah also chairs the Ghana Pentecostal and Charismatic Council. He was deputized by Sam Korankye Ankrah. He is a member of the National Peace Council along with Prof. Emmanuel Asante and Bishop James Saah. Challenges He claims to have faced some challenges in his ministry. Significant among them is a review of church culture concerning head covering and wearing of trousers by females in church services. This review was made by the church's college of apostles, prophets and evangelists in January 2010 and subsequently issued a communique to inform church members about the review. The review was not accepted by some of the members and the general public which resulted in strong criticism against his leadership. Gibson Annor-Antwi, the co-author of the autobiography of Onyinah, believes that one of his strengths is the ability to handle difficult issues with absolute cordiality. He wrote that before the review of the said practices, the general secretary of the church, Apostle Dr. Alfred Koduah, was tasked to conduct an in-depth analysis of the issue. In an interview conducted by Gibson Annor-Antwi, Kodua said, \\"When on Tuesday 19 January 2010, I finished and presented the paper, it received a standing ovation\\". Another member of the college, Apostle Peter Ayerakwah, proposed that a communique should be written to all assemblies hence, the 46-page document of F. Koduah was collapsed into two pages for circulation. The communique was rejected by some members of the church, especially some elders from Beposo to Agona Ahanta in the Western Region as published in the Daily Guide Newspaper by Sam Mark Essien, Takoradi on 19 February 2010. Aftermath of this publication, was a strong agitation by members and officers who called the house of Prof. Opoku Onyinah with threats and anger. According to Annor-Antwi, Opoku Onyinah led leadership and in spirit of love and explained the issues which eventually restored peaceful atmosphere in the church.

He was an expert on early keyboard instruments, and assembled an important collection which now forms the Raymond Russell Collection of Early Keyboard Instruments of the University of Edinburgh.  Life  Russell was born in London on 27 May 1922, the son of Gilbert Russell and his wife Maud, n√©e Nelke. His father was from an aristocratic family related to the Dukes of Bedford, his mother a noted patron of the arts. The family was rich; from 1934 they lived at Mottisfont Abbey in Hampshire. In the Second World War Russell initially applied for registration as a conscientious objector, and was formally exempted from combatant service, but changed his mind. He enlisted in the Royal Fusiliers, where he reached the rank of captain. He had already begun collecting keyboard instruments in 1939, before hostilities began. Over the next twenty years he assembled a considerable collection of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century clavichords and harpsichords. His collection included instruments from all the main harpsichord-building areas of Europe: a number of English spinets; early harpsichords and virginals from Italy; Flemish instruments by the Ruckers; a late French instrument by Pascal Taskin; and a clavichord and harpsichord from North Germany, both by Johann Adolph Hass. Russell was an able harpsichordist, and became an expert organologist. He catalogued the keyboard instrument collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the collection of Benton Fletcher, now in Fenton House. In 1959 he published The Harpsichord and Clavichord: an Introductory Study, with accurate and detailed analysis and descriptions of the instruments. Russell was an early advocate of a historicallyinformed approach to instrument-building, based on study of surviving historical examples, and a return to traditional methods of both performance and construction. His book influenced builders such as Frank Hubbard in this direction. Russell was also an expert on, and collector of, early treatises of medicine; towards the end of his life, he researched the antiquities of the island of Malta.  The Russell Collection  By 1960 Russell had decided to donate his collection to Edinburgh University, where it was to become the nucleus of a centre for research in keyboard performance practice and organology, but this plan was not completed by the time of his death. He died in Malta on 17 March 1964. In 1968, in his memory and in accordance with his wishes, his mother donated almost all his collection to the university, which later bought two more of his instruments; the donation also included his notes and his collection of documentary photographs. The twenty-one instruments constitute the Raymond Russell Collection of Early Keyboard Instruments, which is housed in St Cecilia's Hall in Edinburgh.

She headed Kelly G. Knight LLC, a business advisory firm based in Lexington, Kentucky. She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in a vote of 56‚Äì34, and was officially sworn in as the United Nations ambassador on September 10, 2019. She formally presented her credentials to Secretary- General Ant√≥nio Guterres on September 12, 2019. Early life and education Craft was born in 1962 in Lexington, Kentucky, the daughter of the late veterinarian Bobby Guilfoil and Sherry Dale Guilfoil. Her father was a Democratic Party activist who once served as chairman of the Barren County, Kentucky Democratic Party. She grew up in Glasgow, Kentucky, and graduated from Glasgow High School in 1980. She graduated with a B.A. from the University of Kentucky in 1984. Craft served on the board of trustees of her alma mater, the University of Kentucky, for a term beginning August 2016, but resigned to accept the Canadian ambassadorship a year later. Political involvement and donations In 2004, Craft was a prominent supporter of George W. Bush, who appointed her an alternate delegate to the United Nations in 2007. As part of the delegation, her responsibilities included advising the UN ambassador on US/Africa policy. Craft has been described as a generous donor to Republican political candidates. In 2016, Craft and her husband donated millions of dollars to candidates for the 2016 Republican nomination for president. Prior to donating more than $2 million to Donald Trump's campaign, the couple supported Marco Rubio. Craft and her husband, Joe Craft, have strongly supported Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell in turn urged Trump to nominate Craft as ambassador to Canada. The Crafts have \\"gold\\"-level membership at Trump hotels, which is for customers who have stayed more than 20 times at Trump hotels; according to the Washington Post, such memberships are rare. U.S. ambassador to Canada On June 15, 2017, Craft was nominated by President Donald Trump to become the ambassador to Canada. She was confirmed by the United States Senate by voice vote on August 3 and assumed office on October 23. In her first week as ambassador to Canada, Craft said in an interview with CBC News that when it comes to the scientific consensus on climate change she believes in \\"both sides of the science.\\" According to a June 2019 report in Politico, Craft was frequently absent from her Ottawa post during her tenure as ambassador. During a 15-month period, she took 128 flights between Ottawa and the United States, the equivalent of a round trip per week. 70 of the trips either had Lexington, Kentucky as the origin or destination of her trips, which raised questions as to whether the trips were for personal reasons. The Trump administration did not provide records of how many days Craft was present in Ottawa; per State Department rules, an ambassador may only spend 26 work days away from a post. She spent 300 days (more than half of her term) absent from her post. Craft does not make her schedules available. U.N. ambassador Kelly Craft presents credentials to Antonio Guterres Craft with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo in 2020 On February 22, 2019, Trump announced his intention to nominate Craft to replace Nikki Haley, who had resigned the previous year, to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, after his first replacement choice, Heather Nauert, withdrew her nomination. On May 2, 2019, Craft's nomination was formally sent to the United States Senate. On June 19, 2019, a hearing on her nomination was held before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. During the hearing Craft said that she would continue to fight what she alleges as anti-Israel bias in the United Nations. Although Craft had previously said during her tenure as ambassador to Canada that she believed there were \\"good scientists on both sides‚Äù of the climate debate, during her confirmation hearing she reversed her position stating that she believed that fossil fuels and human behavior have contributed to climate change. Due to her family's connections to the coal industry she also agreed to recuse herself from any UN discussions involving climate change or coal.

It is named after the confiscation or concealment of Tibetan flags that were used as part of the demonstrations. This has led to extensive efforts to determine if, and if so, by whom, these decisions were made.  Chronology  Flag of Tibet On the 15th of June, 2012, Chinese president Hu Jintao visited Copenhagen, eliciting demonstrations against Chinese dominion over Tibet, in which the Tibetan flag was displayed. In that context, several protesters were detained or had their flags confiscated. Years later, in 2015, the existence of an order within the Copenhagen police to \\"shield the Chinese president from protesters\\" was brought into public light. In June 2013, when another high-ranking Chinese politician Yu Zhengsheng visited, protesters once again displayed the Tibetan flag, and were blocked from the view of Yu and his entourage. An official in the Ministry of Justice was persuaded on the 30th of July, 2013 to cease her investigation of the events of the 2013 demonstration on the grounds that it might harm the Minister of Justice Morten B√∏dskov.

It was built in 1905 to a National Romantic design by Andreas Theil and decommissioned in 1972. History =Background= The waterworks at Mantziusvej The planning of a modern water supply and sewer system in Gentofte began when Niels Andersen became chairman of the parish council in 1888. The summer of 1897 was unusually hot and sunny and many wells in Hellerup. Bregneg√•rd Waterworks opened at Mantziusvej in 1900 and so did Gentofte's first water tower at H. A. Clausensvej close to Gentofte Church. They supplied Hellerup, Skovshoved, Ordrup and Gentofte with water. The system reached Vangede in 1902 and J√¶gersborg in 1903. The water tower was designed by Johan Schr√∂der. The water tank had a capacity of 432 cubic metres and the water surface was located 50 metres above sea level. The site where it was built was located 26 metres above sea level and had previously belonged to Gentofte Rectory. The water was led from six pumping stations to a collection well and from there through three sand filters to the water tower at H. A. Clausensvej. =The water tower at R√¶veskovsvej= R√¶veskovsvej Water Tower under construction The topping off ceremont photographed by Alfred Theodor Collin The completed water tower The population of Gentofte Municipality increased from 14,470 om 1901 to 20,709 in 1906. The growing population created a need for a second water tower. A site which comprised R√¶vebakken, a 36m tall hill located circa 500 to the northeast of Vangede, was therefore acquired from the Brog√•rden estate in 1904. The water tower was built in 1905. It was designed by the architect Andreas Thejll with collaboration with Asger Ostenfeld. Ermelunden Waterworks, a second waterworks, opened in 1907. Sj√¶ls√∏ Waterworks was inaugurated in 1936. =Decommissioning= Gentofte Municipality's population peaked in 1952 at 89,142 and Tuborg Breweries increased its production increased dramatically, leading to new capacity problems for its water supply system. It was therefore decided to build a new and taller water tower at j√¶gersborg station. J√¶gersborg Water Tower was inaugurated in 1956. The water tower at R√¶veskovsvej was decommissioned in 1972. Descruption The entrance The tower is designed in the National Romantic style. The design is remniscient of that of the gunpowder magazine in Frederikshavn. It is built in reinforced concrete and stands on a foundation of boulders. The water tank has a capacity of just over 1,000 cubic metres and is supported by pillars. The windows are small and arched. Above the entrance is Gentofte's old coat of arms featuring three church bells as well as the year '1905'. The roof is finished by a small copper-clad spire with Weather vane. Just below the roof is a walkway.

It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. History Established in Jersey in 1988 to provide fiduciary services to private clients, Sanne started to work with corporate customers in 2003. Inflexion Private Equity supported Sanne's acquisition of State Street's corporate administration business and took a significant stake in Sanne in return for providing the funds in January 2013. Sanne was then the subject of an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange in March 2015. However, it attracted some criticism because it secretly signed up shareholders before announcing the floatation. There was also some criticism that the company spent ¬£11 million on the floatation. The company acquired Chartered Corporate Services, a Dublin-based business, in February 2016 and, more significantly, International Financial Services, a Mauritius-based business with $82 billion of assets under management, in December 2016. Then in September 2017, it bought Luxembourg Investment Solutions and Compliance Partners on an earn-out basis. The rising volume of regulation also drove expansion. Following these acquisitions and some subsequent organic expansion, the company's growth rate was described by Investors Chronicle in March 2018 as \\"explosive\\". The succession planning arrangements attracted some criticism when the departure of Dean Godwin as Chief Executive was announced in January 2019 just 12 months after Spencer Daley left his post as chief financial officer; the news unsettled the market, as Godwin and Daley had led the initial public offering, and the share price fell 18% in a day. In the wake of the Covid 19 pandemic, the company has benefited from customers focusing on the management of existing portfolios rather than new fund raising. Commentators suggested that the fact that the pandemic has so far had a minimal impact on client delivery made the company a \\"rare prospect of earnings resilience\\".

He finds that corporate management cannot influence the profitability of airline carriers due to regulations, although he suggests the frequency of flights may do so. In a review for the Transportation Journal, University of Illinois professor Hale Barlett calls it \\"an excellent study\\" and \\"recommended reading for those who wish to deepen their knowledge of the air carrier industry and how firms compete in this regulated industry.\\" In another review for The Journal of Business, Ohio State University professor C.C.

He studied both Indian and western music theory and published extensively on the topics. He founded the Bengal Music School and Bengal Academy of Music. A staunch supporter of the British Empire and its agencies in India, he was commissioned to set Indian translations of God Save the Queen to Indian tunes. Biography  Sourindro was the son of Hara Kumar Tagore and a younger brother of Jotindro Mohun Tagore belonging to the Pathuriaghata branch of the Tagore family. His family owned extensive lands including the battleground of Plassey and the pilgrimage site Ganga Sagar. He studied at the European-model Hindu College in Calcutta and took an interest in music, both Indian and western. He published a book on music at the age of fifteen, developed a system of musical notation for Indian music and set up the first Indian music orchestra in Calcutta. He collected musical instruments from India and donated many to museums across the world. He received an honorary Doctorate of Music from Philadelphia (1875) and Oxford (1895).  Music and writings  In 1877 the declaration of Queen Victoria as Empress of India led to the creation of the national anthem of \\"God Save the Queen\\". In 1882 a National Anthem Committee was created at the suggestion of Francis Harford. In 1883 he wrote On the Good That May Result to England and India from the Establishment of \\"God Save the Queen\\" as a National Anthem in Her Majesty's Eastern Empire. A translation of the wording of the anthem was made by Mirza Mohammed Bakir Khan of Bishop's College, Calcutta into Arabic and Persian. These were then further translated into many other Indian languages. The problem of singing the anthem in a style that would suit Indian musical taste was however vexing and the committee chose the foremost authority on Indian music to help- \\"a letter will immediately be forwarded to Dr. Sourindro Mohan Tagore, of Calcutta, the principal authority upon Hindu music, requesting him to secure the services of the best native composer, and a melody which shall at once suit Oriental taste and the measure of the translated hymn.\\" The idea was supported by others like Sir Henry Rawlinson. Sourindra Mohun produced no less than twelve different variations of the anthem based on lum jhijhiti, behag and nagara kirtana styles. In one variant he chose rag sahana which he claimed was the \\"favourite melody of the Mahomedan Emperors of India.\\" Tagore also claimed that Indians always supported rule by Kings and he published a book, Hindu Loyalty, with extracts from old Sanskrit sources on the need for rule by Kings. He dedicated the book to Augustus Rivers Thompson and supported the ideas of Canon Harford that the anthem would help earn loyalty. It has been noted that a major motivation for Sourindra Mohun to work with the National Anthem Committee was to align his family and social group with that of the colonial rulers. He also set some poems by Lord Lytton to Indian tunes in A Few Lyrics Of Owen Meredith Set to Hindu Music, with Added Words and Signs Noting the Two-Part Form of the Tune in Hindustani Music and a Tal Pattern. He also published on The Caste System of the Hindus (1884) and noted its antiquity and justified its role in Indian society. Signature on book gifted by Tagore to Monier Williams Among Sourindra's published works was a translation of Kalidasa's Malavikagnimitra. He founded the Bengal Music School in 1871 and the Bengal Academy of Music in 1881. He was made Fellow of the University of Calcutta and a Companion of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire in 1880 apart from being given the title of Raja. He was decorated Knight Commander of the Royal Order of the Crown of Italy and several other Royal recognitions from Sweden, Netherlands, Wurtemberg and Austria. In 1877, he made an initiative to renew musical ties with Japan by sending three musical instruments to the Emperor Mutsuhito of the Meiji Era to help bring the musical traditions of two nations together. In 1884, in order to promote the interest in and study of Indian music in other countries, he donated numerous collections of Indian instruments to institutions in North America and Europe including the Royal College of Music, London. Tagore worked to establish an annual award at the College, the Tagore Gold Medal, which is still given to \\"the most generally deserving pupil(s)\\".

Bates was born in Kansas City, Missouri on February 23, 1902, the son of W. Scott and Emyle Louise (Carlat) Bates. He graduated from Westport High School in Kansas City in 1919. While in high school he attended Culver Summer Naval School (Culver, Indiana), in 1917 and 1918. He earned both an A.B. (1923) and an A.M. (1924) from the University of Missouri and then a master in business administration (M.B.A.) from the Harvard Business School in 1925. Career Bates joined his father's lumber yard business, W. S. Bates & Son, in 1923 and remained a partner until 1940. The yard was in Nevada, Missouri. He started his career at the Harvard Business School as an Assistant Dean in 1925. Over the course of his forty- year career as a faculty member, he became the Williston Professor of Investment Management at the Harvard Business School.

He was also a member of the New England Committee for the Quartermaster Corps for testing cold weather and mountaineering equipment (1942‚Äì44). In Investment Management: A Casebook, Bates presents many business cases of investment management. Reviewing it for The Journal of Finance, University of Washington professor Fred J. Mueller suggested the cases were outdated. Meanwhile, French industrial economist Jacques Houssiaux said in Revue √©conomique that the cases could not be applied to the French context, though he hoped the book would inspire French investment managers.

Reid and his sister and two brothers arrived in Queensland with their parents aboard the barque Rockhampton in October 1863, his parents settling in Bowen, where his father was appointed their first Presbyterian minister, and the first minister of religion to settle in the town. He died of dysentery just three years later. Rev. James Reid and Eliza Reid's children were:It is likely their first child, name not known, died in infancy. This would account for J. S.

Their third newspaper was the Cooktown Courier at Cooktown, where one of their staff was H. E. King.

In the days following the publication of the New York Times story, Uber admitted that it had used Greyball to thwart government regulators, and it promised to stop using the tool for that purpose. Development and use Uber reportedly developed Greyball to identify individuals who Uber suspected of using its service improperly, and it began using the tool as early as 2014. According to Uber, Greyball can \\"hide the standard city app view for individual riders, enabling Uber to show that same rider a different version.\\" Uber claimed that it used Greyball to deny service to individuals suspected of violating the company's terms of services, such as people seeking to harm Uber drivers, disrupt Uber operations, or carry out law enforcement actions against Uber drivers. However, after The New York Times revealed Greyball's existence in March 2017, Uber said it would stop using it to evade local government regulators. According to the New York Times report, which was based on interviews of four current and former Uber employees and a review of internal Uber documents, Greyball used several methods to identify and deny service to government officials who were investigating Uber for violations of local laws, especially when Uber moved into a new city. Those methods included: * Geofencing. Uber would create a digital map that identified the locations of city government offices. If a potential rider attempted to hail a ride from the area around a government building, Greyball would flag the individual as a possible law enforcement agent. * Mining credit card databases. If Uber identified a credit card as being associated with a government agency or police union, it would flag that individual in Greyball. * Identifying devices. Since government agencies would often buy cheap cellphones for use in sting operations, Uber employees would visit electronics stores to obtain device numbers for inexpensive phones and input those device numbers into Greyball. * Searches of social media. Uber employees searched social media profiles to identify possible law enforcement agents. Uber then flagged those individuals in Greyball. * Eyeballing. Greyball would determine if a potential rider had been opening and closing the Uber app numerous times without calling for a ride. This was especially used in conjunction with Geofencing to detect official monitoring. U.S. Department of Justice investigation In May 2017, several news organizations reported that the United States Department of Justice had opened a criminal investigation into Uber's use of Greyball to avoid local law enforcement operations. The Department of Justice initially focused on Portland, but the inquiry was expanded to include Philadelphia. City of Portland investigation On March 6, 2017, the City of Portland, Oregon announced an investigation into whether Uber had used Greyball to obstruct the enforcement of city regulations. The investigation by the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) found that: Following the release of the audit, Portland's commissioner of police suggested that the city subpoena Uber in order to force the company to turn over information on how Uber used software to evade regulatory officials. Transport for London ruling Transport for London cited the use of Greyball in London as one of the reasons for its decision not to renew Uber's private hire operator licence in September 2017. The decision stated that the way in which Uber used Greyball contributed to it failing to meet the standards of a \\"fit and proper\\" private hire operator. Consequently, Uber would not be able to operate legally in London after its licence expired on 30 September 2017 unless they entered an appeal within 21 days. Uber's appeal against the ban was heard at Westminster magistrates' court on 25 June 2018. In December 2018, Uber lost an appeal of the case at the Court of Appeal, but was granted permission to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, it continued to operate in London.

She was one of the first British journalists to court-report via Twitter, covering the 2012 obscenity trial, R v Peacock. Early life and education Hodgson was born and grew up in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. She was educated at the independent Wakefield Girls' High School. She graduated from the University of York with a first class honours degree in English and Related Literature in 2006. Hodgson then undertook a National Council for the Training of Journalists diploma in magazine journalism at Harlow College in Essex. Journalism career Following internships at the BBC, New Statesman, and the Erotic Review, Hodgson worked in legal journalism at The Law Society, before moving to Standpoint magazine as production editor and contributing writer. While working in the unpaid internships in London, she worked as a part-time dominatrix. During this time she began to freelance for the Guardian, BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio 2 and Sky News, commenting on gender, civil liberties and technology issues. In 2012, she reported on rival Tokyo Pride celebrations in Japan for the New Statesman, Guardian and BBC Radio. She left Standpoint to go freelance soon after. She wrote the 'Sexual Adventurer' column for Men's Health' which ran until 2016. Hodgson has written about sexuality and society from a psychological and investigative perspective, covering everything from the science of BDSM, to dating apps that run criminal record checks. She once openly criticised a Tory MP who once euphemistically invited her to \\"tea\\", before telling her he couldn't take her to the Buckingham Palace Garden Party because of her sex-positive journalism. In 2017, a video of Hodgson debating Men's Rights Activist Mike Buchanan on Kay Burley's Sky News show went viral when Buchanan failed to respond to her statistical evidence of discrimination against women. Buchanan conceded that one path to equality would be for men to do women's housework. Hodgson is a regular commentator on Sky News and frequently dissects the papers on the Sky Sunrise Paper Review, where she is paired with the Telegraph's Brexit editor Asa Bennett (Hodgson is a vocal Remainer). She is also a regular guest on BBC3, BBC World News, BBC Radio 2 and 4, and Eamonn Holmes' TalkRadio show. Her documentary, 'Can Porn Be Ethical?' was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2015, and she was a guest in an episode of Late Night Woman's Hour alongside Caitlin Moran in 2016. Her most recent radio documentary, 'Being Bisexual', was broadcast in July 2017 on the BBC World Service, for which she was short- listed for the DIVA Journalist of the Year 2018 award. In May 2018 she appeared on The Big Questions calling for a reinvention of sex robots, the use of tech to heal PTSD and trauma, and the potential care of elderly people with AI and robotic assistance. Hodgson currently writes for the Times business insert Raconteur on health and technology issues. Most recently she has contributed to ex-Head of BBC News James Harding's new launch, Tortoise Media. Topics covered include the future of contraception and the abuse facing LGBT+ people on dating apps. In July 2019 she appeared as a dating expert in episode two of Romesh Ranganathan's BBC One Show, The Ranganation. Literary career Her first book, Bound To You, a BDSM memoir, was published by Hodder & Stoughton in 2012, which she wrote in just six weeks. Her second book, The Curious History of Dating, was published by Little, Brown in January 2017. Spanning a three-hundred-year period, the book looks at the history of courtship and marriage from a feminist perspective, and includes the history of LGBT and mixed race relationships. A review in the Law Gazette described it as a 'pacey, intelligent and authoritative account with bags of wit'.  Personal life  She is bisexual.

Munich was, and is, a significant German city, as much culturally as well as industrially. Augsburg, twenty miles to the west, was a main centre of diesel engine production (and still is today). Although some considerable distance from the United Kingdom, Munich is not a difficult city to find from the air, mainly due to its size, and possibly its proximity to the Austrian Alps to the south- east as a visual reference point. Munich was protected (initially) by its distance from the United Kingdom. There were seventy-four air raids on Munich, with 6,632 people killed and 15,800 wounded. Around 90% of the Altstadt was severely damaged due to the policy of carpet bombing (Fl√§chenbombardement). At the start of the Gro√üdeutsches Reich in 1939, Munich had a population of around 830,000, and was the fourth-largest city in Germany. Air force units involved Munich was bombed by RAF Bomber Command and the USAAF. 24‚Äì25 April 1944 attack =USAAF= During the day of 24 April 1944 the city and the surrounding area was heavily attacked by the USAAF.Battle over Munich Over seven hundred bomber aircraft took part in the attack, and the bombers were escorted by P-51B, P-38J, and P-47D aircraft, with around eight hundred fighter aircraft. The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber aircraft came from the 8th and 9th Air Forces. The attack was intended to limit production of the Dornier Do 335 at Dornier Flugzeugwerke, Oberpfaffenhofen and turbine blades for the Junkers Jumo 004 axial-flow turbojet. Oberpfaffenhofen is now the home of the mission control center Deutsches Raumfahrt-Kontrollzentrum of the Deutsches Zentrum f√ºr Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V. (German Aerospace Centre). =RAF= On the night of 24/25 April 1944, 234 Lancasters and 16 Mosquito aircraft from the RAF attacked Munich. It was a devastating and concentrated attack, and around 80% of the buildings in the target area were destroyed.April 1944 attack The attack was noted for a new method of target marking at low level from 700 feet. Karlsruhe, further to the north-west, was also heavily bombed by the RAF that night. Nine Lancaster aircraft were lost in the raid. Damage The city received around 450 large bombs (Luftminen, around 4,000lb), 61,000 high- explosive bombs, and around 3,316,000 4lb magnesium incendiary bombs (Stabbrandbombe, developed by ICI). Around 50% of all of Munich was damaged. 81,500 houses were completely or partially destroyed, de-housing around 300,000 inhabitants.

It was closed in 1912; the building became a public school. The site is now occupied by a replacement school building that preserves the college bell. History The college was founded in 1850 with five teachers and 100 studentsMacum Phelan, A History of Early Methodism in Texas, 1817‚Äì1866, Nashville, Tennessee: Richmond Cokesbury, 1924, , p. 331 (online at Archive.org). as Chappell Hill Institute, a boarding school; the land was donated by Jacob and Mary Haller. It was chartered by the Texas Legislature on February 9, 1852 as Chappell Hill Male and Female Institute. A second building was added that year to separate the sexes. In fall 1852 it became Chappell Hill College and P. S. Ruter, who had taught at Transylvania University, became president. His sister Charlotte was head of the music department, and Elizabeth Knox headed the female division.Phelan, p. 358.Carole E. Christian, \\"Chappell Hill Female College\\", Handbook of Texas online, June 12, 2010, retrieved March 4, 2017. Tuition for a session of five months was advertised as ranging from $8 for \\"reading and spelling\\" to $20 for \\"Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Astronomy, Physiology, Algebra, Geometry, Latin, Greek, or the higher branches of Mathematics\\" and $25 for music or piano \\"with use of instrument\\". In 1854 the college had 100 students, and was acquired by the Methodist Church as a replacement for Rutersville College. The male division became Soule University,Phelan, p. 404. and the female division was rechartered on August 29, 1856, as Chappell Hill Female College. Fires required replacing the building at least once, and the college was badly affected by the Civil War and by yellow fever epidemics, but it had paid off its debts by 1873. In 1878 the president was Epaminondas Dunn Pitts.\\"Chappell Hill Female College\\", Cyclop√¶dia of Methodism, ed. Matthew Simpson, Philadelphia: Everts & Stewart, 1878, , p. 197.

A dormitory and a music hall were added in the 1880s, and the college played a prominent role in the culture of the area, particularly after Soule University closed in 1887; the college's monthly literary magazine, the Philomathean, was active in raising money in the mid-1880s to establish a home for Confederate veterans. Enrollment had risen to 112 by 1885, but fell by half in the following ten years: the college took in 70 public school students, 50 of them boys, to raise money. The Methodist Texas Conference provided support, and the college was given the Soule University property to reduce its debt, but public schools in Texas were improving, women's colleges were less popular, and yellow fever continued to be a problem in the area. The curriculum was revised in 1900 to conform to the Methodist Church General Board of Education; a study published in January 1912 assessed the college as offering primarily secondary-school level courses.Elizabeth A[very] Coulton, \\"Southern Colleges for Women\\", The North Carolina High School Bulletin 3.1 (January 1912) 3‚Äì19, p. 14; revised as \\"Standards of Southern Colleges for Women\\", The School Review 20.7 (September 1912) 458‚Äì75, p. 472 (misspelled as \\"Chapel Hill\\"). It was closed in 1912, at which time enrollment was 112. The building was used as a public school until 1926, when it was replaced by the building that now houses the museum of the Chappell Hill Historical Society.

He later had great success as a breeding stallion in the United States, siring Hector Protector, Hansel, Timber Country, Bosra Sham and Hawk Wing. Her dam Jode was a half-sister to the Kentucky Derby winner Spend A Buck. Racing career =1998: two-year-old season= On her racecourse debut Hula Angel started at odds of 8/1 in maiden race over seven furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse on 4 July in which she finished seventh of the ten runners behind the colt Aljabr. Racing against female opposition in a maiden over the same distance at Goodwood on 30 July she finished third behind the Henry Cecil-trained Bionic. On 19 August in a maiden at Kempton she recorded her first success as she led from the start and won by four lengths from the favourite Oriental Fashion. The filly was moved up sharply in class when she was sent to Ireland for the Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh on 6 September. Starting a 14/1 outsider she led for most of the way before fading in the closing stages and finishing eighth of the thirteen runners behind Edabiya. After a four-week break, Hula Angel returned in the Listed Oh So Sharp Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 3 October. After being restrained by Hills in the early stages she struggled to obtain a clear run in the last quarter mile but stayed on to take third place behind Smittenby and Fragrant Oasis with favourite Wince in fifth place. Two weeks later over the same course and distance she started at odds of 10/1 in a fourteen-runner field for the Group Two Rockfel Stakes. Wince started favourite while the other runners included Subito (Blue Seal Stakes), Atlantic Destiny (Sirenia Stakes), Fragrant Oasis and Valentine Waltz. After settling just behind the leaders she went to the front a furlong from the finish and won by a length and a quarter from Valentine Waltz, with the other Hills-trained runner Hasty Words a hort head away in third place. =1999: three-year-old season= Hula Angel began her second season in the 1000 Guineas run that year over the July Course at Newmarket on 2 May. Starting at odds of 14/1 she tracked the leaders on the stands-side (the right-hand side from the jockeys' viewpoint) but made little progress in the closing stages and finished sixth behind Wince, Wannabe Grand, Valentine Waltz, Capistrano Day and Pescara. Three weeks later at the Curragh she faced Wince yet again in the Irish 1000 Guineas and started a 16/1 outsider whilst her old rival was made the 5/4 favourite. The other fifteen runners included Edabiya, Sunspangled, Mythical Girl (Princess Margaret Stakes), Show Me The Money (Round Tower Stakes, Cornwallis Stakes, Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial Stakes), Capistrano Day and Carambola (Derrinstown Stud 1,000 Guineas Trial). Hills positioned her on the outside just behind the leaders as Carambola set the pace, before beginning to make progress approaching the final quarter mile. She took the lead a furlong from the finish and held on under strong pressure to win by a neck and a head from the outsiders Golden Silca and Dazzling Park. After the race Barry Hills said \\"She has done it well today. The ground was on the fast side for her at Newmarket. Obviously the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot is on the agenda, but I would like to run her over a mile and a quarter at some stage and she could go for the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood.\\" Hula Angel failed to reproduce her Curragh form in two subsequent races. In the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot on 16 June she finished unplaced behind Balisada after being hampered two furlongs from the finish. On her final appearance she made little impact as she finished seventh of the eight runners in the Falmouth Stakes at Newmarket on 9 July. Breeding record Hula Angel was retired from racing to become a broodmare. In 2008 she was put up for auction at the Inglis Weanling & Breeding Stock Sale and was bought for $528,220 by Heritage Bloodstock. She has produced at least eleven foals and six winners: *Stormy Love, a chestnut colt, foaled in 2002, by Giant's Causeway.

Though extinct as a distinct ethnolinguistic group, their descendants survive among the neighbouring Nunggubuyu. Language Warndarang has been classified as a member of the Gunwinyguan language group. Though thought to be extinct by 1974, some sources state that a fluent speaker was interviewed in 1989 and provided significant amounts of oral text in the language, together with a translation into Kriol. Country The traditional lands of the Warndarang extended over an area in Arnhem Land of some from the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Phelp River inland to Mount Leane. To their north were the Nunggubuyu while their western borders reached inland, eastwards to the Ngandi territories between the Walker and Rose rivers. History In 1903 the Eastern and African Cold Storage Company purchased the Hodgson Downs cattle station and other tribal lands, and embarked on a policy of systematic extermination of all Aboriginal people residing on the land which the company directors wished to turn into a pastoral empire. Hunting gangs consisting of 10-14 Aboriginal (though not local) men, armed and under the supervision of a white or \\"half-caste\\" foreman, were commissioned to clear the land by shooting any Aboriginal person on sight. When the Church of England established the Roper River Mission in 1908, the remnants of the Warndarang, together with survivors of other local clans of peoples such as the Alawa, Marra, Ngalakan, Ngandi, and the southern clans of the Rembarrnga and Nunggubuyu gathered there for sanctuary from the onslaught.

This was because before its description in 1958 all the species of the genus Automate were found in the Indo-Pacific region. A. branchialis has not been recorded in the Indo-Pacific region and has been found to be widespread in the Mediterranean so it is now considered to be a Mediterranean endemic. Discovery and distribution Automate branchialis was originally described from specimens collected by Holthuis & Gottlieb off the coast of Israel in the 1950s. At the time the pistol shrimps of the genus Automate were only known from the Indian and Pacific Oceans and although Holthuis & Gottlieb described their specimens as the new species Automate branchialis it was assumed that it had invaded the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal from the Red Sea by Lessepsian migration. A. branchialis was subsequently collected from a number of locations in the Mediterranean including Izmir Bay in Turkey, in the Greek Islands, Cyprus, from Manfredonia Bay in Italy, Malta, off Marseilles, the Balearic Islands and off Spain. The widespread distribution of A. branchialis in the Mediterranean and the lack of any records in the Indo-Pacific region have led researchers to conclude that it is a previously overlooked endemic Mediterranean species.

After moving to Austria in 1891, she became the first woman to lecture at the University of Vienna when in February 1897 she gave two public lectures on Britain's cooperative movement. Soon afterwards she concentrated on the history of art, especially modern art. In 1898 she founded a school in Vienna, based on those in England, with a focus on art and the English language. In addition to her contributions to art journals, she published a number of books on Austrian art. Biography Born in Birminghamin 1853, Levetus grew up in an active Jewish family environment with strong religious, literary and cultural interests. After schooling in Birmingham at King Edward's School, she attended the Midland Institute and Mason College before studying economics and teaching at the universities of Birmingham, St Andrews, Cambridge and Aberdeen. In 1891, she moved to Vienna where she taught English and became active as a journalist. In 1897 she was invited to give two lectures at the University of Vienna on the cooperative movement in Great Britain, becoming the first woman to lecture at the university. Shortly afterwards, her interest turned from economics to art and culture, especially modern art which she had experienced through John Ruskin and William Morris while still in England. She began to associate with the Secession group of modern artists and those from the Kunstgewerbeschule who reflected the trends she had seen in Britain. This encouraged her to contribute to become the Viennese correspondent not only for the London art magazine The Studio but for several German-language periodicals. She also kept the Viennese informed of trends in British art by contributing to Kunst und Kunsthandwerk. In 1904, she published Imperial Vienna: An Account of its History, Traditions and Arts, targeted at readers back in her native Britain. After articles on \\"Modern Decorative Art in Austria\\" and \\"The Art Revival in Austria\\" for The Studio, she collaborated with Michael Haberland to publish Peasant Art in Austria and Hungary in 1911, one of the first detailed accounts in English of Austrian folk art. Despite being considered by some as belonging to the enemy during the First World War, she continued to teach, continuing the activities of the John Ruskin Club which promoted English conversation. This was later seen as evidence of the Volksheim's liberal outlook. In 1925, together with the historian Friedrich Hertz, she launched the Revue Reconstruction in support of the redevelopment of Austria. She also contributed to the women's movement in Vienna, lecturing on education and the improvement of conditions for women and for the working classes. Levetus never married. She died in Vienna in 1938.

After having a full-length drama on Broadway, Anderson gave talks on empowerment and success largely related to the New Thought movement. Born in Wichita, Kansas, his family moved to Sacramento, California. Anderson left home at an early age, working as a newsboy, railroad porter and hotel bellhop. In his late 30s he read a book about New Thought, saw a play by Channing Pollack and thought that his life experience and new attitude had the makings of a play. Anderson wrote the initial version of Appearances; with the assistance of Al Jolson, the play (the first three-act play by an African American) was produced on Broadway. Although it was not a success, Anderson's industry and can-do attitude were appreciated. The play was produced several times and toured the US and the UK. Anderson settled in the UK, inventing a malted-milk product and giving religious talks. He received support from Dean of Canterbury Dick Sheppard, and returned to the US for a speaking tour. During the tour, he became a New Thought minister and married Doris Sequirra. After their return to England, she wrote a book about their experiences which was published in the UK and the US. Anderson wrote other plays and books; in early 1939 he was promoting his book, Uncommon Sense, as a possible play. After having a heart attack in London, he died in New York a few days after his return. Anderson was cremated, and Doris brought his remains back to the UK. Appearances was the first three-act play by an African American on Broadway after The Chip Woman's Fortune, a 1923 one-act play by Willis Richardson which was the first non-musical Broadway play by an African American. The substance of Appearances moral dimensions and its history are the objects of diverse points of view. Background According to Alan Kriezenbeck in 1994, most available primary information about Anderson is in the Billy Rose Theatre Division of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. Most of the material is unsourced, undated newspaper clippings from Anderson's scrapbooks.Garland Anderson and \\"Appearances\\": The Playwright and His Play by Alan Kreizenbeck, The Journal of American Drama and Theatre; New York, N.Y.6.2 (Spring 1994): 28. The Helen Armstead-Johnson collection at the library also has a number of clippings; Anderson was the first person of color who was a member of PEN International. =Kansas= Anderson was born on February 18,Ancestry.com; California State Library; Sacramento, California; Biographical Files, dated March, 1928, noted as author of From Bellhop to Playwright and Appearances on the back.Ancestry.com; Registration State: California; Registration County: San Francisco; Roll: 1544246; Draft Board: 12. 1886, the fourth of twelve children. After about four years of schooling, he and his family moved to California. Their last known residence in Kansas may have been Topeka in 1895,Kansas State Historical Society; Topeka, Kansas; 1895 Kansas Territory Census; Roll: v115_137; Line: 19. and a March 1928 California State Library biography lists his parents as Louis Anderson and Naomi Bowman. Newspaper articles also indicate the early-to-mid-1890s for Anderson's arrival in California;Henry Doughterty, \\"Noted negro's philosophy does not embrace 'isms'\\", The Honolulu Advertiser, January 29, 1936, pp. 1, 5. they referred to his father's birth in slavery,\\"Garland Anderson captures London\\", The Pittsburgh Courier, January 18, 1930, p. 16. and Wichita was incorporated as a city on July 21, 1870 (after the American Civil War). The only black man then in the settlement, a migrant from the east, signed the petition to form the city.Michael Carmody, \\"Early Wichita's African-Americans\\", February 20, 2014. It is doubtful that Anderson's parents' families were from Wichita; his parents were probably attracted to it because of economic opportunity and relatively-relaxed attitudes about race. Churches for blacks were founded in the late 1870s, and a larger black settlement began during the 1880s.Patrick Joseph O'Connor, \\"Black Experience and the Blues in 1950s Wichita\\", Mid- America Folklore, Spring 1993. After Wichita was incorporated, it experienced an economic boom with the founding of two colleges and the passage of the Kansas Civil Rights Act of 1874. By 1890 Wichita was Kansas' third-largest city, despite anti-Chinese violence in 1886Julie Courtwright, \\"A slave to yellow peril - the 1886 Chinese ouster attempt in Wichita, Kansas\\", Great Plains Quarterly, Center for Great Plains Studies, paper 2351, January 1, 2002. and increased racial segregation. The city fell into recession, and many of its original settlers went bankrupt. =California= When Anderson's family arrived in Sacramento, his father was a janitor for the post office. His mother died shortly after their arrival, and Anderson soon moved to San Francisco. From the 1860s to the 1880s San Francisco began its transformation into a major city, expanding in all directions and culminating in the 1887 construction of Golden Gate Park. The city's cable-car system was developed around this time. During the first decade of the 20th century, Anderson worked as a newsboy; decades later, his old boss remembered him working before the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. He may have been a railroad porter after the fire. For about 15 years beginning around 1909, Anderson worked as a bellhop at a number of hotels. According to a 1918 draft card, Anderson was married and a hotel clerk in San Francisco. In the 1920 census Anderson, divorced, worked on Sutter Street as an operator; his father was born in Virginia and his mother in Ohio.Year: 1920; Census Place: San Francisco Assembly District 32, San Francisco, California; Roll: T625_138; p. 3B; Enumeration District: 200; Image: 289. Appearances Anderson briefly dabbled in Christian Science. In early 1924, before he heard about Channing Pollack's The Fool,Wood Soanes, \\"Curtain Calls\\", Oakland Tribune, April 29, 1924, p. 29. he became aware of psychology and read a book on New Thought, which impressed him.\\"Bell boy turns to play writing\\", The Sun (New York), January 12, 1925, p. 11. Anderson received tickets from an elderly couple, saw Pollock's play and became convinced that he could write a comparable play based on his experiences. His son was eight years old at the time,In the Black world: Thomas Fleming's 20th Century By Thomas C. Fleming Edited by Max Millard. and the whereabouts of his first wife are unknown. Anderson headed the household of his brother's widow and her four children. He later said about his decision to write: > At first the idea seemed absurd ... No one realized more than myself that > though I wanted to write this play, I had no training in the technique of > dramatic construction; but I also realized that to shirk what I wanted to do > could be likened to the outer shell of the acorn after it was planted in the > ground saying to the inner stir of life for expression, \\"What are you > stirring for? Surely you don't expect to become a great oak tree?\\" With this > firm conviction I determined to write a play.\\" He wrote about the process of writing: > Whenever the switchboard would ring while I was writing I would say to > myself, \\"This is just a loving call coming just at the right time to refresh > my thoughts in order that I might be able to write better\\"; and when someone > would speak to me I would mentally say, \\"This is a loving interruption > coming at just the right time to prevent me from writing the wrong thing. Anderson wrote Don't Judge By Appearances in three weeks. According to his typist, she became engrossed by it and it helped her solve a personal problem. He showed the play to San Francisco Chronicle critic George Warren; Warren thought the idea very good, but its writing needed work. Anderson received support from friends and co-workers at his hotel because of his optimism and enthusiasm.J. F. Driscoll, \\"Here are your young Americans who have made good spectacularly. Nothing could stop them from climbing up and up and up\\", St. Louis Post-Dispatch (St. Louis, Missouri), December 13, 1925, p. 130. He was connected with Al Jolson, who supported the play's early development and his move to New York City in 1924.

Anderson made the rounds of newspapers, who took him at his word. By April, however, the play had funding difficulties. Early in the month, Anderson presented a reading to an audience of 600 at the Waldorf-Astoria to drum up support.\\"600 Waldorf- Astoria guests applaud negro bellhop's play\\", Buffalo Evening News, April 7, 1925, p. 18. Although audience members were reportedly moved to tears, the reading earned only $140.

Berlack, \\"Post lenten dances give many thrills\\", The Pittsburgh Courier, April 25, 1925, p. 3. and a free reading at the Manhattan Opera House was scheduled for April 26.* \\"Judge not according to appearance\\" (advert), The New York Times, April 20, 1925, p. 21. * \\"Bellboy's play to have a second reading\\", The Sun (New York), April 20, 1025, p. 9. When funding still lagged, Anderson went to see President Calvin Coolidge and New York Governor Al Smith; in June, another writer was brought in and the play was renamed Appearances. Theater manager Lester W. Sagar offered to produce it, receiving an option to purchase half the rights for $15,000 while Anderson retained the West Coast production rights. Two Braeburn Apartments residents reportedly became major investors. Anderson returned to his job in San Francisco, selling half the West Coast production rights for another $15,000 after two public readings (the second broadcast on KFCR). His sendoff from the mayor of San Francisco was well-publicized; he hurried back to New York in a touring car driven by a friend\\"Drives flint coast to coast in 120 hours\\", The Sun (New York), September 2, 1925, p. 22.

The play received a standing ovation on opening night but lukewarm reviews, although Anderson was praised. The New York Times called it \\"finely conceived, crudely wrought. ... If the language of the play is not always smooth and eloquent, if many of the characters are overdrawn, if the plot dips too often into melodrama, the play is none the less moving ...

Given the fact that increasing personalization nowadays replaces more and more the political content, Wahlkabine.at considers the publication of all party- programs and their scientific contextualization as a fundamental tool for political participation as well as a revealing resource collection for personal reflection on the voting behavior.Cf. \\"Why wahlkabine.at?\\" at: http://wahlkabine.at/ueber/Infofolder_wahlkabine_ENGL.pdf/attachment_download/file (retrieved 08-10-2016).

The first was Ella FitzGerald who continued until 1926 when Elise Sprott took over. There was an overlap with Margery Wace OBE in 1930-31 and Quigley took over the role in 1936. Quigley was given an MBE for her work organising talks on the radio during the war. She contacted Donald Winnicott who had worked with Clare Britton, a psychiatric social worker treating children who had become evacuees. His first series of talks in 1943 was titled \\"Happy Children\\", Quigley offered him total control over the content of his talks but this soon became more consultative as Quigley advised him on the correct pitch.

Life and career  Mary Rennell was the daughter of the first Lord Bicester and was educated at home by private tutors, but at 17 she joined the Slade School of Fine Art as a part-time student while also, for several months, working as a ward maid for the war wounded before the Armistice on 11 November 1918. After leaving art school she shared a studio with Diana Walton in Kennington, London. She married Francis Rodd, the explorer, diplomat and author, in 1928 and the couple went on to have four daughters. In the 1930s Rennell was introduced to the \\"Oxford Group\\" by a friend of her mother's. This later became the Moral Re-armament Association (MRA) of which Rennell was an active participant for 18 years. In 1940 Rennell took her children to America to avoid the impact of World War II on London. Before returning to Britain, in 1943, she held a one- woman show of drawings in New York. In 1952 Rennell converted to Catholicism. From 1952 onwards she travelled extensively with her husband. In Australia she held one-woman shows in both Perth and Melbourne in 1968. She also exhibited frequently in London at the Royal Society of British Artists, The Royal Society of Portrait Painters and at the Royal Academy. Originally Rennell mostly painted landscapes in oils but later turned to drawing in ink on rice paper. There are seven works by Rennell in the Tate's prints and drawings collection. The Arts Council of Wales and the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth also hold examples of her work.

After KNC forces entered the town of Khanasor in the Iraqi Sinjar Mountains, fighting boke out among unclear circumstances, resulting in dozens of casualties. The clashes have widely been seen as symptomatic for the high tensions among the forces that fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) around Sinjar, and the risk that these tensions could escalate into turf wars, which would degrade any attempts to drive the extremist group from the region for good.  Background  YJ√ä fighter in 2016. YB≈û and YJ√ä were organised and trained by the PKK, resulting in their conflict with the Kurdistan Democratic Party. When ISIL invaded the Sinjar Mountains in 2014 and began to massacre its Yezidi population, the PKK intervened with hundreds of fighters in order to save the locals from the Islamic State militants. Since then, the PKK set up two local Yezidi self-defense groups, namely the Sinjar Resistance Units and the √äz√Ædxan Women's Units. In late 2015, anti-ISIL forces finally succeeded in driving the Islamic State mostly from the Sinjar area, but the PKK fighters have since refused to leave and continue to train and equip the local PKK-affiliated militias. This has caused resentment among the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), which regards Sinjar as part of Iraqi Kurdistan and sees the PKK as local political rival. The KDP believes that the presence of the PKK in Sinjar is illegal, and that their own Peshmerga forces are the only legitimate security force of the area. The Rojava Peshmerga are Syrian Kurdish fighters affiliated with the KNC, which in turn was set up by the KDP, and effectively operate as part of the KDP's regular armed forces.  History  On 2 March, the Rojava Peshmerga stated that they would relocate to the Syrian border near al-Hawl in order to stop smuggling operations, but as they moved further south into the Sinjar Mountains, they came into conflict with the Sinjar Resistance Units at Khanasor. The KNC forces later claimed that they had been blocked by the YB≈û while simply passing through the area, while the YB≈û in turn argued that the Rojava Peshmerga had attempted to occupy Khanasor on the orders of Turkey and the Kurdistan Democratic Party. On the next morning, heavy fighting broke out in Khanasor. Both sides later accused each other of having initiated the battle: Whereas the YB≈û said that they had peacefully asked the KNC fighters to leave the town, whereupon the latter attacked them with heavy weapons, the Rojava Peshmerga stated that they were first shot at and decided to take a stand rather than simply retreat. In any case, heavy clashes broke out, during which several fighters were killed or wounded, and several civilians also became casualties. On 4 March, a ceasefire had come into effect, with PKK-affiliated groups and the KNC negotiating a solution of the conflict, though pro-PKK media claimed that the peshmerga prepared a new attack on Khanasor.  Reactions  Pro-PKK media claimed that the fighting was the result of a Turkish attempt to \\"turn the Southern Kurdistan territory into a battle field, starting from Shingal, and thus to invade this territory\\". According to this view, the Rojava Peshmerga were proxies of the Turkish MIT, hostile to both the PKK as well as the Yezidis. The YB≈û also claimed that they enjoyed the full support of the local population, and PKK-supporting locals as well as some Yezidi refugees in Al- Malikiyah indeed protested against the invervention of the Rojava Peshmerga and said that the pro-PKK forces had every right to defend themselves from the Peshmerga attacks. In Rojava, the Kurdish youth group Ciwanen Soresger, which is close to the PKK-allied Democratic Union Party, attacked KNC offices in Al- Darbasiyah and Qamishli in protest of the Sinjar clashes. The Peshmerga, on the other side, blamed the pro-PKK fighters for the escalation. They argued that they wanted to avoid further clashes, but were also the legitimate security force of Sinjar and because of that, \\"Peshmerga forces are free to move whenever and wherever they want in Kurdistan's soil. We will not ask permission from anyone\\". The KDP also stated that the PKK should simply leave Sinjar to avoid further tensions, with Omed Sabah, spokesperson of Masoud Barzani, stating that the YB≈û' presence in Sinjar was not legitimized \\"just because they have a few people from Shingal in their rank\\". Osman Baydemir, the spokesperson of the HDP, called the conflict between the pro-PKK and pro- KDP forces a \\"civil war\\" that \\"has to stop\\". Similarly, Patriotic Union of Kurdistan deputy Kosrat Rasul Ali also condemned the infighting on both legal as well as moral grounds. Josef Weidenholzer, a Member of the European Parliament and chairman of the Yezidi Friendship Group, appealed the Rojava Peshmerga and the Sinjar Resistance Units to \\"stop all hostilities and solve political differences\\", also because any international support to either faction is dependent of \\"the peaceful solution of Intra-Kurdish problems\\". Several civilian inhabitants of Khanasor, meanwhile, expressed frustration and anger at the clashes, saying that both groups should focus on expelling ISIL from southern Sinjar rather than fighting each other. Some locals even said both groups should simply retreat from the Sinjar Mountains, and leave the Yezidi civilians alone. Both Mir Tahsin Beg, leader of the Yezidi community, as well as Nadia Murad, female Yezidi activist and UN Goodwill ambassador, called on both sides to stop the fighting. Murad said that \\"it is deeply saddening for me to see once again victims of Genocide become victims of an internal conflict, it is painful to see the Yezidi women again are suffering from fear after all that happened to them\\". An expert also warned that both the Sinjar Resistance Units as well as the Rojava Peshmerga had been very effective at \\"keeping IS at bay\\" and that the fighting among these anti-ISIL forces \\"would slow the process to liberate the remaining territory from IS\\". In a statement on 3 March, the Kurdish National Alliance in Syria, which consists of former KNC groups, called for the cessation of hostilities in Sinjar. The alliance called on all armed groups to \\"resort to calm and restraint\\" and to begin dialogue. The KNAS also called for an end to \\"biased media campaigns\\" that broadcast \\"sedition\\" among Kurdish factions. The Ministry of Defence of Germany expressed concern that German weapons supplied to the Peshmerga were used in the clashes. \\"The government of the Kurdistan- Iraq region has committed itself, by final declaration, to use the delivered weapons only for the fight against the so-called Islamic State and in accordance with international humanitarian law\\", a defence ministry spokesman told Der Spiegel on 6 March.

Early life Irene Bianucci was born on December 16, 1903 in Lucca, Tuscany, Italy to Assunta (n√©e Cataldi) and Amadeo Bianucci. When she was six years old, her family immigrated to the United States, first settling in Farmer City, Illinois, before moving to the nearby city of Clinton. After graduating from Clinton High School in 1922, Bianucci went on to study at Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois. In 1924, Bianucci won the Minnie Bachman Mueller prize from Millikin for exceptional ability in execution of a mural entitled \\"Music\\". She began entering her work in county fairs winning two first place ribbons at the Illinois State Fair in 1926 for a still life and a painting of animals. Graduating from Miliken after completion of her studies, Bianucci continued her training, enrolling at the Chicago Art Institute, later that same year. Returning to the fair competition in 1927, Bianucci won three blue ribbons and five red ribbons for her paintings at the state fair. In 1930, she was awarded the Union League Club of Chicago Art Prize for her painting, \\"Little Russian Girl\\" and then won The Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Fellowship to continue her studies in New York. Bianucci's painting, \\"La Pensierosa\\", was selected to be part of the Art Institute of Chicago‚Äôs 34th Annual Exhibition in 1930. The following year, she participated in a show of works by the present and former students of George Raab at the Decatur Art Institute. Bianucci's portraiture was singled out for its eye- catching qualities. Career Beginning in 1931, Bianucci worked as a professional portraitist. Her studio was located on Dearborn Street and she participated in gallery showings in 1935 at the Chicago Art Institute and Tower Town Galleries. Glowing reviews of her works, such as \\"In the Storm\\", \\"Rain\\", and \\"Young Girl\\", appeared regularly in Eleanor Jewett's column on the arts in The Chicago Tribune, in 1940. Rural Scene-Wakarusa Valley Bianucci joined the Works Progress Administration (WPA) artists of Illinois, receiving commissions to paint murals in Chicago at the Clara Barton Elementary School and the Martin A. Ryerson Elementary School. Her two murals at Ryerson, Discovery of America and Landing of Columbus were painted in 1940. Her mural at Clara Barton School was later destroyed. In 1941, Bianucci won the commission to paint the post office mural at Mount Carroll, Illinois. The mural, entitled Rural Scene‚ÄìWakarusa Valley, was an oil on canvas farm scene, which was restored in the late 1990s. When the federal artist's program ended in 1943, Bianucci worked as an illustrator and designer for the Container Corporation of America throughout World War II. Bianucci married fellow artist, Roy Robert Soravia, who was involved in the Op art movement and directed the Parnassus Gallery in Chicago. In 1949, the couple moved to Leucadia, Encinitas, California. Both continued to paint and showed their works at such galleries as Mandel Brother's Art Gallery of Chicago.

Sowerby III proposed in 1896 the name Mangilia adcocki as a nomen novum for the Mangilia bella of Adams and Angas (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1863, p. 419, pi. xxxvi, fig. 6), their name being preoccupied by Hinds. G.W. Tryon (Manual of Conchology, vol. vi, p. 270) considered it identical with Mangelia boakei , Nevill, a Ceylon shell with which from the figure and description, it seems to me to have but little affinity. Adcock's list gives as a synonym Mangilia gracilima, Tenison -Woods, but I have sought the records in vain for the name.Sowerby, G.B. (3rd) 1897.

Tryon erred in ascribing this species to Ceylon.\\" Hedley, C. 1922. A revision of the Australian Turridae.

She occupied herself as a woodcarver, portrait painter, and book illustrator. As an illustrator, she collaborated with her sister, Elizabeth Eggleston Seelye, and her father, Edward Eggleston, on a number of books including The story of Columbus (1892), The story of Washington, and The Graysons. Early years and education Allegra Eggleston was born in Stillwater, Minnesota, November 19, 1860. She was the second daughter of Edward Eggleston, the author, who came of a well- known Virginia family, with strains of Irish and Scotch in his descent. Her mother's family was of English origin. A delicate and high-strung child, she early showed a talent for drawing and modeling. One of her first works of art was an idol carved out of a piece of semi-decayed wood, when she was only six years of age. She drew constantly and modeled occasionally in clay, but she had no art teaching until she was received into classes in Cooper Institute in October, 1875. She was under age, being only 14, but was accepted on account of remarkable promise. She did creditable work there for two years, after which she entered the studio of Wyatt Eaton, where she made rapid progress in painting from life. In 1878, she went to Europe in company with her father and family for a year. While abroad, she took lessons under a Swiss wood-carver in Paris and astonished him by successfully carving the most difficult pieces as soon as she had learned the use of her tools. About 1891, she returned to study art in Paris with Charles Lasar and was friends with the American miniaturist from Cleveland, Sarah Elizabeth Rickey (1844-1923). Career After her return home, she occupied herself with wood-carving, painting also some portraits, which were exhibited in the annual exhibitions of the Society of American Artists. In 1882, she carved panels for a memorial mantel piece in the editorial rooms of The Century Magazine, on one of which was cut a portrait in bas-relief of Dr. Josiah Gilbert Holland. That piece of work was destroyed by fire in 1888, and Eggleston was called upon to replace it. Later, she occupied herself with book illustrations. Her father's novel, The Graysons, is illustrated by her, while many of the pictures in his popular school histories, as well as in other school books, bear her signature. She illustrated The story of Columbus, written by her sister, Elizabeth Eggleston Seelye, and edited by their father, as well as The story of Washington. Eggleston was versatile. She created many kinds of artistic decorative works for amusement including paintings of children's faces. Among other things she modeled in leather, having executed the cover for the album containing autographs of distinguished American authors, which was presented to Mrs. Grover Cleveland, Frances Folsom Cleveland Preston, as an acknowledgment of her interest in the father's copyright bill, International Copyright Act of 1891. Personal life Eggleston spent the winter in New York City and made her home during the rest of the year at Lake George, where she had a studio in her father's stone library. She lived unmarried in The Owl's Nest with her friend Mabel Cook. Known as Tante, Eggleston died in 1933.

Born in Craiova, he was the oldest child of Nicolae BrƒÉiloiu and his wife, Zoe or Zinca (n√©e VlƒÉdƒÉianu or VlƒÉdoianu). He had two brothers, one of whom died early, and three sisters. His father, born to Iordache ZƒÉtreanu and Marghioala BrƒÉiloiu, had been adopted by logothete Dumitrache BrƒÉiloiu around 1788. BrƒÉiloiu, VlƒÉdƒÉianu and ZƒÉtreanu are all old boyar families from the Oltenia region.Vlad, p. 35 Constantin was married twice: to Coralia Ghica-Brigadier, and then to Ecaterina (Catinca) Hagi Moscu. He had three sons and three daughters by the latter. One of the daughters, Maria, married Anton Berindei. A son, Nicolae, was the father of Constantin BrƒÉiloiu.Vlad, pp. 35-6 Starting in 1822, BrƒÉiloiu went to school abroad, in Sibiu, Geneva and Paris. By 1832, he was a supplementary bureaucrat at the state secretariat. He was also prosecutor at the criminal section of the judicial court (1837), at the court of appeals (1841, 1842) and a member of the criminal appeals court (1853). In 1855, he returned to the secretariat as assessor. The following year, he was named to the committee handling the freeing of the Roma slaves. Subsequently, he was a member of the high court of justice and, in 1859, president of the commercial court.Vlad, p. 36 In 1838 and from 1841 to 1843, BrƒÉiloiu taught criminal law, civil and commercial judicial procedure at Saint Sava College. Following the Wallachian Revolution of 1848, he became director of the country's school administration.

From 1859, at the time of the Union of the Principalities, BrƒÉiloiu entered politics. He was an incisive journalist, as attested by his contributions to Conservatorul Progresist, Unirea, Desbaterile and Timpul. He was also among the most active conservative elected officials of the time. In 1859, he was sent as a Gorj County deputy to Wallachia's elective assembly, joining the legislative assembly in 1861. From 1859 to 1861, he sat on the central committee in Foc»ôani, coordinating policy with his counterparts from Moldavia.

History Skovg√•rden was built in 1820. In 1831 it was acquired by the merchant Hans Puggaard who spent the summers there with his wife Bolette. Their visitors included many leading artists of the Danish Golden Age, including C. W. Eckersberg, Vilhelm Marstrand, Bertel Thorvaldsen, Michael Gottlieb Bindesb√∏ll and Herman Wilhelm Bissen. After Hans and Bolette Puggaard's daughter Marie married the politician Orla Lehmann in 1844 the estate was also frequented by many of the leading politicians of the time. Lehmann was a key figure in the adoption of the Constitution of Denmark in 1849. As a gift to his children, Pugaard also commissioned the architect Michael Gottlieb Bindesb√∏ll to build another country house in the area. It was named Krathuset for its location in Ordrup Krat. After Puggaard's death in 1866, Skovg√•rd was taken over by his grand daughter Margrethe Lehmann together with her husband Gotfred Rode. Rode, a prominent literary historian, created a meetingplace for Grundtvigian and National Liberal opinion leaders. In 1874 he established a folk high school in the building but it closed after his death in 1878. In 1880. Skovg√•rd was acquired by Frederik V. Hegel, owner of Gyldendal. He used it as a summer residence together with his son and daughter-in-law Jacob and Julie Hegel. The house remained a meetingplace for Copenhagen's literary establishment until the 1920s. After that it was for a while left empty. In the 1940, Skovg√•rd was purchased by Hentofte Municipality whose intention was to build a new primary school at the central location in the growing suburb. The house was listed and it was therefore decided to move it to a new located at Krathusvej 36. The house was later refurbished by Mogens Lassen.

It is largely known for its pediment featuring a military scene, the Spanish victory over the Moors in the Battle of T√©touan. The church was declared a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines.  History  The construction of San Joaquin Church was completed in 1869 during the Spanish colonization era by Augustinians. The convent of the San Joaquin Church was left in ruins after the World War II leaving its noted well and kiln which were used for baking. The then National Historical Institute marked the church as a National Historical Site in 1980 pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 260 of 1973 and Presidential Decree No. 375 of 1974. In the 1980s the church structure underwent renovations. The side and back walls and the altar area was reinforced by cement by local priest which according to heritage conservationists caused the loss of the structure's integrity and authenticity. The structure was declared a National Cultural Treasure (NCT) by the National Museum of the Philippines (NMP) in 2001. The declaration also covers the convent ruins of the church complex. In 2015, a restoration was accomplished on the church building under the watch of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines but the lime plaster or palitada used to cover the facade chipped off in less than a year which led to heritage conservationists criticizing the national heritage body. Following the declaration of the San Joaquin Campo Santo cemetery as a NCT by the NMP, the heritage organization labels the church complex and the cemetery as the \\"San Joaquin Church Complex and Campo Santo of San Joaquin, Iloilo\\". Just recently, January 19, 2019, the Parish of San Joaquin celebrated the 150th Anniversary of the Church since 1869, the year the church's construction was completed during the time of Fray Tomas Santaren, OSA. The parishioners with the priests assigned helped together to re-enhance the interior design of the church and making all ways of restoring the original designs especially of the tabernacle with its gradas and also of the design of the side retablos. All the designs were carefully made so as to reflect the original designs of the church. The church was solemnly dedicated by His Excellency Most Rev. Jose Romeo O. Lazo, DD last January 18, 2019. Adjacent to the church, is the new Adoration Chapel which was blessed on the day of the fiesta celebration last January 19, 2019.  Features  The pediment of San Joaquin Church featuring the Battle of T√©touan The features of note of the church are its three retablos of carved limestone which were formerly polychromed, the carved pediment which featured the folk portrayal of the Spanish winning over the Moors at the Battle near T√©touan, Morocco as well as its adjacent sprawling ruins where an oven well and kilin for baking can be found.

The Ottoman Navy ordered her from the Imperial Arsenal in Constantinople, and she was laid down in 1870, launched in 1872, and commissioned in 1874. She was armed with four guns, was powered by a single-screw compound steam engine with a top speed of . The ship saw action during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878, but was laid up from 1878 to 1897. At the start of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, the Ottoman Navy mobilized Mukaddeme-I Hayir and the rest of the ironclad fleet but found almost all of the ships to be in unusable condition. Mukaddeme-i Hayir was disarmed the following year and converted into a stationary training ship in 1911. After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, she became a barracks ship, and served in this capacity until 1923, when she was broken up. Design Mukaddeme-i Hayir was long between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draft of . The hull was constructed with iron, and displaced normally and BOM. She had a crew of 16 officers and 153 enlisted men. The ship was powered by a single horizontal compound steam engine which drove one screw propeller. Steam was provided by six coal-fired box boilers that were trunked into a single funnel amidships. The engine was rated at and produced a top speed of , though decades of poor maintenance had reduced the ship's maximum speed to by 1892. Mukaddeme-i Hayir carried of coal. A supplementary sailing rig was also fitted. The ship was armed with a battery of four rifled, muzzle-loading Armstrong guns mounted in a central, armored casemate, two guns per side. The guns were positioned so as to allow any two to fire directly ahead, astern, or to either broadside. The casemate had heavy armor protection, with the gun battery protected by 229 mm of iron plating. The upper section of the casemate had thinner armor, at thick. The hull had a complete armored belt at the waterline, which extended .6 m (2 ft) above the line and 1.2 m (4 ft) below. The above-water portion was 222 mm thick, while the submerged part was 150 mm thick. Service history Mukaddeme-i Hayir, meaning \\"Great Abundance\\",} was ordered in 1868 from the Imperial Arsenal in 1868, a copy of her British-built sister ship . The vessel was laid down in 1870 and launched on 28 October 1872. She began sea trials in 1874 and was commissioned later that year. Early in the ship's career, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was activated every summer for short cruises from the Golden Horn to the Bosporus to ensure their propulsion systems were in operable condition. The ship's only period of significant activity came three years later, with the outbreak of the Russo- Turkish War, which began on 24 April 1877. The Ottoman fleet had already mobilized in September 1876 and begun preparing for conflict, as tensions with Russia had been growing for several years, an insurrection had begun in Ottoman Bosnia in mid-1875, and Serbia had declared war on the Ottoman Empire in July 1876. At the onset of hostilities with Russia, Mukaddeme-i Hayir was based in Sulina with several other ironclads. On 14 May 1877, an Ottoman squadron consisting of Mukaddeme-i Hayir, Feth-i B√ºlend, , , , and bombarded Russian positions before landing infantry to capture of the Black Sea port of Sokhumi two days later. On the 31st, Mukaddeme-i Hayir, Feth-i B√ºlend, the steam frigate , and several other ships departed Batumi for Trabzon to bring ground troops to Varna to defend against an expected Russian attack across the Danube. By June, Mukaddeme-i Hayir had returned to Sulina at the mouth of the Danube, where she assisted in the defense of the town, along with a gunboat and an armed tugboat. Starting in November, a Russian flotilla of small vessels attempted to lay a minefield off Sulina to block the Ottoman vessels. On 8 November, the Ottoman gunboat was sunk by the mines, and Mukaddeme-i Hayir steamed out to engage the Russian vessels, forcing them to withdraw before they could complete the minefield. The next day, the Russians returned with mortar-equipped gunboats; neither side scored any hits before each flotilla withdrew. The Ottoman ironclad fleet in the Golden Horn In 1878, the ship was laid up in Constantinople, and she remained inactive for almost 20 years. The annual summer cruises to the Bosporus ended. By the mid-1880s, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was in poor condition, and Mukkademe-i Hayir was unable to go to sea. Many of the ships' engines were unusable, having seized up from rust, and their hulls were badly fouled. The British naval attache to the Ottoman Empire at the time estimated that the Imperial Arsenal would take six months to get just five of the ironclads ready to go to sea. Throughout this period, the ship's crew was limited to about one-third the normal figure. During this period of inactivity, she was modernized slightly in 1882, with the addition of several light guns. These included a pair of Krupp guns, two Krupp guns, two guns, and two Nordenfelt guns. By January 1886, Mukaddeme-i Hayir had been stationed in Tripoli in Ottoman Libya; at that time, she was the only Ottoman ironclad in active service. In February 1897, a Greek uprising against Ottoman rule broke out on Crete, prompting the Great Powers to deploy the International Squadron ‚Äì a multinational force made up of ships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, French Navy, Imperial German Navy, Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina), Imperial Russian Navy, and British Royal Navy ‚Äì to Cretan waters to intervene in the uprising. The squadron‚Ä≤s senior admirals formed an \\"Admirals Council\\" that manage affairs on Crete until the uprising came to an end in December 1898. Events on Crete led to the start of the Greco-Turkish War of April‚ÄìMay 1897. In anticipation of the war breaking out, the Ottomans inspected the fleet in February 1897 and found that almost all of the vessels, including Mukaddeme-i Hayir, were completely unfit for combat against the Greek Navy. Through April and May 1897, the Ottoman fleet made several sorties into the Aegean Sea in an attempt to raise morale among the ships' crews, though the Ottomans had no intention of attacking Greek forces. In 1898, Mukaddeme-i Hayir had her guns removed and placed ashore; her boilers also were removed. Following the end of the war with Greece in May 1897, the Ottoman government decided to begin a naval reconstruction program. The first stage was to rebuild the older armored warships, including Mukaddeme-i Hayir. The Ottomans contacted several foreign shipyards, and Krupp's Germaniawerft received the contract to rebuild Mukaddeme-i Hayir on 11 August 1900, but the deal was cancelled and the ship was not reconstructed. In 1911, she was converted into a stationary training ship, and after the outbreak of World War I in 1914, she became a barracks ship. Mukaddeme-i Hayir was transferred to ƒ∞zmit in 1920, where she continued to serve as a barracks ship. She was decommissioned in September 1923 and broken up for scrap in ƒ∞zmit.

She is a graduate of the School of Visual Arts in New York, NY and The International Center of Photography at Bard College MFA program. Her work focuses on history, identity, representation, and what it means to be a woman in the 21st century. Her work is in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum, and the Carnegie Museum.  Early life and education  Faustine was introduced to photography as a child. Her father and uncle were amateur photographers, and Faustine's first camera was a gift from her uncle. Faustine was initially inspired to become a photographer by a series of Time Life books. She was influenced by Diane Arbus, Richard Avedon, and photojournalist Ernst Haas. However, at a young age Faustine struggled to find herself in the histories of photography she encountered, which focused on photographers who were disproportionately male and white. Faustine received a BFA at the School of Visual Arts in New York. She earned an MFA at the International Center for Photography-Bard College program in 2013. As an MFA student, Faustine began to move away from the traditional documentary model. \\"It just didn't work for me anymore. I wanted more room to play with communication. Conceptual works appealed to me.\\" Faustine began to work on \\"White Shoes\\" as a graduate student. Influenced by Lorna Simpson and Carrie Mae Weems, Faustine began the series as her thesis project in 2012 and continued to add to it over the subsequent three years. Mitochondria (2008-) In the ongoing series \\"Mitochondria\\", Faustine photographs herself, her mother, her sister, and her daughter in their shared home in Brooklyn, NY. The work illuminates both the strength of their familial bond and their interdependent destinies. The New York Times observed that the series is \\"a celebration of the power of African American women to nurture family, even in the direst circumstances. The series‚Äô title refers to the mitochondrial DNA encoded in human genes, which is inherited solely from the mother. Through this scientific metaphor, the series commemorates the continuity of African American womanhood from one generation to another . . . .The series also underscores the role played by women of color in the struggle for equality and justice. Historically, African American women were marginalized within mainstream feminism. Nevertheless, they were able to turn to and embolden each other in the face of prejudice, even before the advent of the modern feminist movement.\\"  \\"White Shoes\\" (2015)  The White Shoes series portrays the history of slavery in New York through a series of nude self-portraits taken in former locations significant to the slave trade. The series also engages with representation of the black female body. This work is based on Faustine's research on the history of slavery in the five boroughs of New York City, including slave burial grounds, slave markets, slave owning farms, and the landing spots of slave ships. Standing in white shoes, she reminds viewers how often African-Americans must adopt white culture. Posing on a wooden box at locations around New York where slaves were once sold, \\"baring her flesh to history, she conveys the most fundamental horror of the slave trade, the way it reduced people to mere bodies, machines of muscle.\\" Her 2016 exhibition at Smack Mellon was reviewed extensively. The New Yorkers Alexandra Schwartz wrote, \\"Faustine‚Äôs photos serve to mark the places that belong to a history too often hidden from view, whether by design, or neglect, or the ever- frenetic pace of change inherent to life in New York.\\"  \\"My Country\\" (2016)  \\"My Country\\", Faustine's solo exhibition at Baxter St. Camera Club of New York, presented works from the \\"White Shoes\\" series, as well as a series of photographs of monuments. The monuments, including the Statue of Liberty and The Lincoln Memorial, are pictured with a black line slicing through the image. The Village Voice wrote that her work was \\"a frank rendering of America's disgraceful and all-too-buried legacy of marginalization\\" and explained the impact of the monument photographs: \\"the graphic interruption stands for the scores of mistreated Americans for whom such structures and their supposed representation of the common good have remained inaccessible\\"  Performances and exhibitions  *\\"Perilous Bodies,\\" Ford Foundation, NY, 2019 Group Exhibition. *\\"Slavery In The Hands Of Harvard,\\" Harvard University, 2019 Group Exhibition. *\\"Refraction: New Photography of Africa and its Diaspora\\", Steven Kasher Gallery, 2018, Group exhibition *\\"Making Them Known: Nona Faustine\\", Artspace, New Haven, CT, 2017, solo exhibition * \\"My Country\\", Baxter Street Camera Club, New York, NY, Dec 8, 2016 - Jan 14, 2017, Solo Show * \\"MAMI\\", Knockdown Center, Maspeth, NY 2016 Group Exhibition * \\"Race&Revolution;\\", Governors Island, NY 2016 Group Exhibition * \\"The Future Is Forever\\", International Center of Photography, Mana Contemporary Art Center Jersey City, NJ 2015 Group Exhibition  References   External links  * http://nonafaustine.virb.com/home Year of birth missing (living people) Living people American photographers School of Visual Arts alumni ","title":"Nona Faustine"},{"id":"53382046","text":"Shrawardine railway station was a station in Shrawardine, Shropshire, England.

The main portion of the house, built about 1813, is a particularly fine example of Greek Revival architecture. The house is owned by the Winchester Historical Society, and has displays of 19th-century artifacts relating to local manufacturing business and the American Civil War, and it also hosts the local fire museum. It is open by appointment. Description and history The Solomon Rockwell House is located northwest of downtown Winsted, at the southwest corner of Lake and Prospect Streets, on a rise overlooking the Mad River. The main house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. A series of ells extend to its left side, ending in a small carriage barn. One of these ells is an older house, built in the mid-18th century. The main block is distinguished by a Greek Revival temple portico with two-story columns. The house achieved much of its present appearance in 1813, when the main block and carriage barn were built. This design was the work of William Swift, an early Connecticut architect. Solomon Rockwell, for whom it was built, owned two iron forges in town. The house passed to the historical society in the 1920s, and has served as a museum since then.

In 1936, Snead enrolled at the Am√©d√©e Ozenfant's academy, Ozenfant Academy of Fine Arts in London. In 1939, Snead immigrated to the United States where she met many other surrealist √©migr√©s. In 1940, Snead traveled by bus to Los Angeles where she was inspired by the landscape and indigenous cultures of the American West and Southwest. Snead moved to Taos, New Mexico in 1946 where she lived in an adobe structure. There, she observed American Native processions and dances. Stella Snead's paintings show her fascination with the \\"earth's most powerful phenomena, including tornadoes, geysers, and volcanoes,\\" revealed by her \\"paintings of animals and humans performing ritualistic movements in anthropomorphic landscapes.\\" One of her better known paintings is Ecstatic Cow (1943). Snead had a solo show in 1941 at Gallery 10 in New York, and shows at Bonestall Gallery in 1945, the Arcade Gallery in London (1945), and at E.L.T. Mesens's London Gallery (1950). In 1949, her work was shown at the Carnegie International Exhibition in Pittsburgh. \\"Wider recognition returned to Snead in 2005, when her work was included in Surrealism USA, a major exhibition of American Surrealism at the National Academy Museum in New York, followed by subsequent exhibitions at the Wadsworth Atheneum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and several important gallery exhibitions of Surrealism.\\" Snead moved to India in the 1950s where she began working as a photographer. Snead is noted for the eight books of photography she published, including Shiva's Pigeons: An Experience of India (1972), Beach Patterns: The World of Sea and Sand (1975), and Animals in Four Worlds: Sculptures from India (1989). These were based on various extended trips to India in the 1960s, where she shot imagery of Hindu sculpture, Indian nature and street life in India‚Äôs urban centers. Snead spent most of her adult life moving between New York City, London, Taos, New Mexico, and India. In 1971, she settled on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, remaining there until her death. Snead died on March 18, 2006, at the Jewish Home and Hospital in Manhattan, New York. According to Snead‚Äôs art dealer Pavel Zoubok, Snead died of natural causes. She left no immediate survivors upon her death. Early life Snead was born in London, England on April 2, 1910 to Ethel May Snead and Clarence Fredrick Heron Snead. In her autobiography, Snead claims that her parents' relationship was troubled due to what she deemed ‚Äúdark moods‚Äù exhibited by her father. Such moods were a contributing factor in Stella and Ethel May‚Äôs exodus from the family home in 1915. Snead's parents decided Stella would be a life-vegetarian and not properly vaccinated in order not to \\"contaminate\\" her blood. Her father began to resent her mother's love, time, and attention she had for her as a child. Her father's meanness towards her mother increased. Her father named Stella Snead Magdalene and registered her as such, but her mother's choice was Stella, which she adopted later on, while Magdalene was used as her middle name. Snead attended a variety of small village schools in England as a child, before attending a progressive theosophical school, St. Christopher‚Äôs, Letchworth. She then took a secretarial course, but never truly employed its benefits, as depressive tendencies kept her from holding a daily work schedule. In 1928, Snead moved from Leicester to Sutton, Surrey. In 1936, Snead joined her only artists friend on the Spanish island of Teneriffe where they painted flowers in a private garden. For the rest of the summer, Snead painted in her bedroom, to her mother's disturbance since she was not exercising and isolating herself from friends. Painting career Out of work due to mental illness, Snead‚Äôs mother supported her until she became transfixed by the notion of painting in her early twenties. Snead originally became interested in painting after a trip to the Spanish island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands. The friend she traveled with painted in the gardens, and after watching her, Snead was inspired to make her own paintings. After three years of independent study, Snead became a student at the Ozenfant Academy of Fine Art in London, England. She studied there under the renowned French abstract artist Am√©d√©e Ozenfant and alongside fellow student and friend Leonora Carrington. After Ozenfant moved to New York to open up the Ozenfant School of Fine Arts in New York, Snead moved to New York in 1939, studying under him until 1941. The declaration of World War II in Europe spurred Snead‚Äôs move from London, England to the United States. In 1939, Snead arrived in New York, but remained only briefly, preferring to travel around the country, often hitching a ride on mail trucks. She lived for several years in Taos, New Mexico. Starting with garden scenes, Snead progressed toward a surrealist style, and frequently featured nocturnal scenes punctuated by semi- human and mystical creatures. Snead claims to have painted her first Surrealist painting in 1941 for a solo exhibition of her paintings. She did this having known Max Ernst, a prominent Surrealist, would come to her show. In 1942, Snead took a Greyhound bus to Hollywood where she started painting things that she saw around her. Snead first visited Mexico in 1944, to see the newly-erupted volcano, Paracut√≠n, though by this time it was dormant. Snead returned to New York later that year with many paintings. Since 1943, her work had focused on fantasy, with animals represented rather more often than people, for example, The Sulky Lion, which was very two-dimensional, with the background buildings out of scale, and Tiger in the Sky, which was similar, but more three-dimensional. After her return to London, Snead endured the break-up of a romantic relationship, which triggered the depressive spell that would end her work as a painter until the late 1980s, when she would endeavor to recreate some of her lost works. Many works were lost, stolen or destroyed, and Snead worked to either locate missing works or repaint them from photographs of the works that were taken in the 1940s. She had her last solo exhibition of paintings in 1950 at The London Gallery in England until 1999's exhibition \\"Rediscovery: The Paintings of Stella Snead\\" at CFM Gallery in New York. The catalog for this show had articles by Neil Zukerman, Whitney Chadwick, Saloman Grimberg, Stephen Robeson-Miller and Pavel Zoubok as well as text by Snead and included a comprehensive timeline of her painting career, childhood, and personal struggles. Snead's last painting was done in 1995, which was a postcard that she \\"surrealized\\" that she named \\"Signals from the Grotto.\\" She claimed that she liked that piece better than anything she produced since 1987. The piece was shown at a show arranged by Robert Metzger at the Aldrich Museum, Ridgefield, Connecticut, in December 1985. Photography career During Snead‚Äôs extensive hiatus from painting, she utilized photography as a creative outlet, photographing the world around her during her travels after World War II. A large portion of Snead‚Äôs photography was inspired by her multiple trips to the Indian subcontinent in the 1960s. Snead lived in India from 1960 until 1971, having moved there after her mother died from a blood clot. Here, her eye for surrealism would manifest in interpretations of Indian monuments and landscapes. Her photography would be published in collections such as Ruins in Jungles (1962), Animals in Four Worlds: Sculptures from India, and Shiva‚Äôs Pigeons: an Experience of India. Later, Snead would use some of these photos to create collages, and would publish a collection entitled Can Drowning Be Fun? A Nonsense Book. In the mid-1950s, Snead's photographic activities took off. Snead learned to print her photographs and began doing her own darkroom work. Snead lived in India from 1960 to 1971, in 1971 she moved back to New York with all her paintings except Rio Grande, which was damaged.

As a child, she attended weekly art lessons under Miss Alida Goodwin, a teacher at South Division High School and All Saints Cathedral Institute, where Emily later graduated. She simultaneously received private painting lessons from her father. These experiences combined provided her with a unique early education compared to the primarily German-speaking community of artists in the area. She attended the Art Institute of Chicago with John Vanderpoel, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and participated in the Art Student's League in New York with Birge Harrison.  Artistic career  Emily Parker Groom became a faculty member at Milwaukee Downer College as an art teacher, where she was eventually asked to create an art department in 1902. She took a break from teaching from 1917-1945, in order to focus on her painting. She built a studio named \\"Windover\\" in 1917 with her sister Mary Groom in Genesee, Wisconsin. She participated in the Public Works Art Project, created by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1933, as a planner and an exhibiting artist. During the Depression years, there was a lack of major exhibitions and she did not participate in many shows or sell many works. During the Great Depression and her teaching term at the Layton School of Art \\"she participated in 'Grab Bag' sales to raise money to assist Layton Students.\\" = Style = She is noted to have worked in various mediums, and a retrospective hosted by the Charles Allis Art Museum contained thirty-four images in chalk, charcoal, graphite, pastel and watercolor and her subjects range from flowers to urban and rural landscapes. She used the wet-on-wet technique \\"that retains a timeless, contemporary element.\\" She also found a way to incorporate the texture of the watercolor paper to make a stucco exterior for buildings in her work. in the 1920s Groom's work became more focused on watercolor and painting plein air. \\"Grab Bag\\" sales are described as selling small work for dollar after it had been displayed for a week in a specially organized exhibition, designated for these sales.

It is in the Amazon biome, and is mostly covered in forest. A number of different ethnic groups live in the territory, often related through marriage, with a total population of over 25,000. There is a long history of colonial exploitation and effective slavery of the indigenous people, and then of attempts to suppress their culture and \\"civilize\\" them. The campaign to gain autonomy culminated in creation of the reserve in 1998. The people are generally literate, but health infrastructure is poor and there are very limited economic opportunities. Location The Alto Rio Negro Indigenous Territory is in the northwest of the state of Amazonas. It has an area of . It is divided between the municipalities of Japur√° and S√£o Gabriel da Cachoeira, and covers 68% of the latter municipality. It borders Colombia to the north and west. To the south the territory adjoins the Rio Apap√≥ris and the M√©dio Rio Negro I indigenous territories. To the east it adjoins the Cu√©-cu√©/Marabitanas Indigenous Territory. Other indigenous territories in the Alto Rio Negro region are the M√©dio Rio Negro II, Balaio and Rio Tea. Together the territories cover more than of the municipalities of S√£o Gabriel da Cachoeira, Santa Isabel do Rio Negro, Barcelos and Japur√°. As of 2016 all had been homologated by the federal government apart from Cu√©-Cu√© / Marabitanas, which had only been declared. The Alto Rio Negro Indigenous Territory is 96.24% in the Rio Negro basin and 3.6% in the Japur√° River basin. The Rio Negro defines the southwest boundary. Major tributaries of the Rio Negro in the reserve include the Xi√©, I√ßana and Uaup√©s rivers. The Tiqui√© River is an important tributary of the Uap√©s. History =Colonial era= From the mid-17th century there was a growing shortage of indigenous labor in the lower Amazon, in part due to smallpox epidemics, and settlers began raiding the upper Amazon and the Rio Negro to capture slaves, massacring those who resisted. The Portuguese reached the upper Rio Negro in the first half of the 18th century and its main tributaries such as Uaup√©s, I√ßana and Xi√©. The Carmelites set up settlements on the Upper Rio Negro near the present city of S√£o Gabriel da Cachoeira. It is estimated that in this period 20,000 Indians were captured to work on the farms of Bel√©m and S√£o Lu√≠s, Maranh√£o. Woven straw shield from the Uaup√©s River, before 1861 In the second half of the 18th century the Portuguese government under the Marquis of Pombal removed the secular power of the missionaries, replacing them by civil or military authorities, and raised the more prosperous settlements to the status of villages or cities with Portuguese names, usually that of a saint. The years that followed saw growing military control of the region, forced labor for colonists and missionaries, depopulation due to forced migration and epidemics, occasional violent revolts and a variety of religious movements. Many of the indigenous people moved to the less accessible upper courses of the rivers. =20th century= In the 20th century there was steady decline in extractive exploitation. Missionary centers were established among the indigenous people, and provided a measure of protection against the traders. North American evangelical missionaries of the New Tribes Mission led by Sophie Muller entered the region in the 1940s. The Salesian (Catholic) missions continued to provide most of the infrastructure of sanitation, education and commerce. In the 1970s the federal government launched the National Integration Plan to integrate the Amazon region with the rest of the country, and FUNAI posts were installed in the Upper Rio Negro region. Army frontier units were also moved into the region. A gold rush invaded the Serra do Tra√≠ra and the upper I√ßana region in the 1980s causing rapid growth of S√£o Gabriel, which doubled in size in less than ten years. Another factor in the growth of S√£o Gabriel was that families moved to the city during the school year due to the closure of the missionary boarding schools. A move by indigenous groups to regain control of their traditional territories developed in the 1990s. =Creation of the territory= Identification of the Alto Rio Negro Indigenous Territory began with ordinance 1.892/E of 19 June 1985. The Federation of Indigenous Organizations of the Upper Rio Negro (FOIRN) was created in 1987, with headquarters in S√£o Gabriel da Cachoeira. Its goals are to obtain self-determination of peoples, defense and guarantee of indigenous lands, recovery of appreciation of indigenous culture, support for economic and social subsistence, and coordination with local and regional organizations. The identification of the territory was submitted to the Ministry of Justice on 28 April 1993. Homologation of the Alto Rio Negro reserves was the main contribution to indigenous people by the Fernando Henrique Cardoso government of 1995‚Äì2003. Demarcation was undertaken between December 1995 and May 1996 coordinated by the Environment Ministry, with funding from a group of industrialized countries led by Germany. The work was coordinated by the FOIRN and the Socio-Environmental Institute (ISA), and involved most of the 600 communities of the region. The Alto Rio Negro Indigenous Territory was declared by decree 301 of 17 May 1996. It was homologated by decree of 15 April 1998. Creation of an indigenous territory with 22 different ethnic groups was justified in part by their practice of linguistic exogamy. People =Ethnic groups= Fishing near Tunu√≠ do I√ßana The majority of people in the Alto Rio Negro region are indigenous, despite forced migrations in the past to the Lower Rio Negro or to the cities of Manaus and Bel√©m. The municipality of S√£o Gabriel da Cachoeira has 37,896 people, of whom 29,017 are indigenous. It is one of the only municipalities in Brazil that has two official languages other than Portuguese, namely Tucano and Baniwa. In January 2009 a Tariana mayor and Baniwa deputy mayor took office in S√£o Gabriel. ISA estimated that there were 14,599 people in the Alto Rio Negro Territory as of 1996. According to Siasi/Sesai (Secretaria Especial de Sa√∫de Ind√≠gena) this had risen to 21,291 by 2008 and to 26,046 by 2013. Indigenous people include Arapaso, Bar√°, Barasana, Desana, Carapan√£, Kotiria, Cubeo, Macuna, Mirity-tapuya, Pira-tapuya, Siriano, Tucano and Tuyuka of the Tucanoan languages group, Baniwa, Bar√©, Koripako, Tariana, Warekena of the Arawakan languages group and Hupda and Yuhupde of the Nadahup languages group. The Eastern Tucano live along the Uaup√©s River and its tributaries, and the Pira Paran√° River in Colombia. The Arawak and Tariano live along the upper Rio Negro, Xi√©, Uaup√©s and I√ßana rivers and their tributaries. The Hupdah, Yuhup, D√¢w, and Nad√™b are semi-nomadic hunters and gatherers who live in the inaccessible inter-fluvial areas. =Socioeconomic factors= According to the 2010 census by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics the territory had 15,183 indigenous inhabitants and just 102 non-indigenous people. Among the indigenous people, 48.1% were women and 51.9% men. Most of the inhabitants of the territory are literate. Of the 11,140 people over ten years old in 2010, 8,366 were literate and 2,774 illiterate. There were 9,242 people over the age of ten considered to be without income, with most others earning less than half the minimum wage. The residents have limited access to health services and economic alternatives. Some efforts have been made to introduce new sources of sustainable income. Thus in April 2015 the Indigenous Organization of the I√ßana Basin (Oibi) inaugurated two Baniwa Pepper Houses, places for production, packaging and storage of the traditional Jiquitaia pepper, a \\"flour\\" of peppers with salt that carries a great range of varieties from the Baniwa women's gardens. In October 2016 ISA reported a growing problem with malaria in the territory. Indigenous people who travelled to urban areas to collect social benefit such as Bolsa Fam√≠lia were becoming infected and carrying the disease back to their communities. The health services in these communities were not able to quickly diagnose and treat the disease, causing rapid spread in areas that had formerly been unaffected. =Organizations= 74 indigenous organizations have been registered in the region. There are Brazilian customs posts at Iauaret√™, Querari, S√£o Joaquim, Pari-Cachoeira and Tunu√≠. FUNAI has posts at Foz do Rio I√ßana, Foz do Rio Uaup√©s, Foz do Rio Xi√©, Melo Franco and Tunu√™ Cachoeira. There are two Catholic (Salesian) missions at Santa Izabel do Rio Negro and I√ßana, and an evangelical mission of the New Tribes Mission. The region, located where Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela meet, is of considered to be of strategic importance by Brazil, which has six army platoons located at key points. Environment I√ßana River The Alto Rio Negro Indigenous Territory is in the Amazon biome. The territory has blackwater rivers with low levels of fish, sandy and relatively infertile soil. The lack of nutrients in the waters of the Rio Negro and its tributaries means that the fish obtain most of their diet from organic matter from the margin of the river, including insects, fruits, flowers and seeds. Although there are some large species, there are many smaller species, each with low numbers of individuals. The forest vegetation is 26.94% campinarana, 71.4% campinarana-rainforest contact, 0.78% open rainforest and 0.89% closed rainforest. As of 2000 had been deforested. This had risen to by 2014, with little deforestation towards the end of this period. In the late 1990s the National Department of Mineral Production (DNPM) reported 451 formal mining concessions in the territory covering 38% of the area. The main threat comes from informal garimpeiro mineral prospectors.

The island is the one of the seven Philippine Turtle Islands. Geography The island is at the very edge of the international treaty limits separating the Philippines from Malaysia. Indeed, the island itself is referred to in the international border treaty concluded in 1930 between the United States (in respect of its then overseas territory, the Philippine Archipelago) and the United Kingdom (in respect of its then protectorate, the State of North Borneo). That treaty sets the international frontier as running in a straight line between Little Bakkungaan Island and Great Bakkungaan Island. Little Bakkungaan Island is one of the three Malaysian Turtle Islands and less than 2km of water separate the two islands. This makes Great Bakkungaan Island the internationally recognized Philippine territory that is closest to Malaysian territory. Great Bakkungaan is the third largest of the Philippine Turtle Islands at with the highest elevation at .U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. \\"United States Coast Pilot, Philippine Islands, Vol.2\\", pp.309-310.

The State of North Borneo, a United Kingdom protectorate, administered the Philippine island. The Republic of the Philippines took over the administration of the island from the United Kingdom on 16 October 1947. Government and ownership The island is part of the barangay of Taganak Poblacion which had a population of 2,430 at the time of the 2010 census. It is in the municipality of the Turtle Islands.

There was a previous controversy concerning the island's ownership. According to a 2009 report in the Philippine Daily Inquirer, the island was settled by a certain Sing Kok Tan in 1952. In 1997 his heirs decided to sell the island to the children of a local politician, Sadikul A. Sahali who later served as governor of the province of Tawi-Tawi. By 2007, according to then Governor Sahali, his children were preparing to submit their application to have their ownership of the island registered.

The comics share her major milestones as a trans woman, while also documenting her moments of insecurity and self-doubt. The three-panel comics cover a variety of topics, such as the experience of being misgendered and undergoing hormone replacement therapy, while utilizing a range of tones from comedic to serious.

The complex houses several government departments: Development, Labour, Social Security, and Ecological Transition. It is located in the block delimited by the Paseo de la Castellana, the Raimundo Fern√°ndez Villaverde street, Agust√≠n de Betancourt street and the San Juan de la Cruz square. The original project was the work of the architect Secundino Zuazo Ugalde and was soon sponsored by the then Minister of Public Works, Indalecio Prieto. Its construction began in 1933 and, although it was paralyzed during the Civil War, the entire complex was completed in 1942. It currently houses the headquarters of the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Public Works, among others. The entire architectural complex is integrated into the so-called AZCA center, one of the most important business centers and offices in the capital. In the vicinity is also the Nuevos Ministerios station, a multiple exchanger with services of Bus, Metro and Cercan√≠as. The building is used in the third and fourth seasons of the series Money Heist (La Casa de Papel in Spanish), in which it is being used as the Bank of Spain. History =Background= During the 1920s, Madrid had surpassed one million inhabitants (with about 800,000 at the beginning of the decade) and the city grew at a good pace (the expansion was almost entirely built as suburbs arose on the suburbs without order or concert). At the end of the decade, and in order to growth and solve the nascent traffic problems, the City Council convened an International Competition for the Ordination of Madrid in 1929, which did not materialize. One of the plans presented had been drawn up by the Spanish architect Secundino Zuazo and the German urbanist Hermann Jansen. Shortly after the proclamation of the Republic, the City Council required the City Planning Office to expand the city. The office prepared it in a very short time, based on the proposals of Zuazo and Hansen. The Government of the Republic considered as a priority the modernization of Madrid and, in 1932, it approved the Capitality Act of Madrid. A year later, the Ministry of Government approved the General Expansion Project, taking almost the entire Municipal Office project. The fundamental point of the project was to achieve the expansion of the city to the north, around the Paseo de la Castellana. As part of this purpose, the old racecourse, which was an obstacle to the planning of Paseo de la Castellana, was demolished. Another important milestone of the project was the construction of rail links between the stations in Madrid. Again Zuazo, this time as a member of the Railways Commission of the Ministry of Public Works, played a relevant role, in charge of convincing Minister Prieto of the inconvenience of placing the Ministry of the Interior in the center of Madrid (in Callao) And to build the rail link between the stations of the North and Atocha, under the Gran V√≠a, due to the great congestion that would occur in the center of Madrid. Thus, on the site left empty by the demolition of the racecourse, the government of the Republic projected, as early as 1932, the construction of a complex in which to locate the ministerial departments, while building an underground rail link between Atocha-Cercan√≠as and A new plant in the north, Chamart√≠n, which would be built by the engineer Eduardo Torroja and popularly called the \\"tunnel of the laughter\\". =Project and construction= The idea of constructing the New Ministries had been the work of Indalecio Prieto, Minister of Public Works. However, this idea had already been raised by Zuazo in his \\"Prolongation Project of Castellana\\" in 1930, so Prieto commissioned the construction of what would be the New Ministries, to house the ministries of Public Works and Government. After the demolition of the racecourse, the first stone was laid on April 15, 1933. Zuazo took the Escorial as an inspiration for the project. However, at the beginning of the Civil War, the New Ministries were unfinished, and the persecution suffered by Zuazo at the end of the war, during which he had been exiled in France, prevented him from continuing with the project. This was finalized by a team of architects related to the new regime, which eliminated or modified important parts of the project, such as the skyscraper planned for the north side. The work was finally completed in 1942, although the Ministry of Public Works and Urban Planning (MOPU) did not move there until 1958. =Nowadays= Arcade belonging to the East side of the complex. Nuevos Ministerios currently houses the headquarters of the Ministry of Public Works, Employment and Social Security, as well as the Ministry of Ecological Transition. The complex is fully integrated into the Castellana and the AZCA Complex, one of the most important business centers and offices in the Spanish capital. From the exchanger of the Nuevos Ministerios Station you can reach the government complex, through Cercan√≠as (Lines C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-7, C- , Metro (Lines 6, 8 and 10) and Madrid Buses (Lines 7, 14, 27, 40, 126, 147, 150, C1 and C2). Characteristics The current aspect of the whole retains much of the original form and style of the project, in which the echoes of the Monastery of El Escorial (in whose maintenance Zuazo worked) and the House of Flowers (an earlier work by Zuazo). The complex consists of a large central space with open spaces, fountains and ponds, around which different ministries are arranged, as well as a large arcade on the side facing Paseo de la Castellana. The archery is one of the most characteristic elements of the whole. Underneath the patio was excavated the one that at the moment is the station of Nuevos Ministerios.

My father taught me the game when I was six, a friend of the family gave me a chess book when I was eleven or twelve, and after that I was hooked.\\" Career Andrew traces his interest in mathematics to 1955 when he was a private at Fort Dix and Eisenhower offered early release to servicemen entering graduate school. He studied at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. For two years he was a Miller Fellow at University of California, Berkeley and also studied at Aarhus, Denmark.

Orleanu (November 20, 1859-January 31, 1942) was a Romanian magistrate and politician. Orleanu's family were originally Ottoman Greeks of Phanariote descent who entered the Wallachian boyar class.Constantin Iordachi, \\"From Imperial Entanglements to National Disentanglement: The 'Greek Question' in Moldavia and Wallachia, 1611-1863\\", in Roumen Dontchev Daskalov, Tchavdar Marinov (eds.), Entangled Histories of the Balkans, vol. I, pp. 138-39. Leiden: Brill, 2013. Wealthy people, they settled in BuzƒÉu County and then Foc»ôani, where Orleanu was born, ultimately moving to Gala»õi. He graduated from the private Institutele Academice in Ia»ôi in 1876. Orleanu then studied law at the University of Paris, obtaining a doctorate in 1881. His thesis, published the following year, deals with illegitimate children in Roman law, and is his chief written work. After returning home, he entered the magistracy, holding a series of posts: prosecutor at the Ia»ôi tribunal (1882), then in Bucharest, judge at the Putna County tribunal (1882), president of the Dorohoi tribunal (1883), followed by R√¢mnicu SƒÉrat (1884), prosecutor at the Gala»õi appeals court (1887-1889). He retired from the judicial system in 1889, entering politics and joining the National Liberal Party (PNL). First elected to the Assembly of Deputies in 1895, he was returned for a number of terms. A fervent supporter of industrialization, from November 1909 to December 1910, he served as Minister of Industry and Commerce under Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu. He authored the 1909 law restricting the right of some 160,000 state employees to unionize and strike; this was called the Orleanu Law or, by its socialist adversaries, the \\"wicked law\\".Dinu C. Giurescu, Dic»õionar biografic de istorie a Rom√¢niei, p. 416. Bucharest: Editura Meronia, 2008. Orleanu served as Assembly President for a fairly lengthy term, April 1922 to March 1926. The early part of this period was marked by debate on what would become the 1923 Constitution, which was adopted by the PNL majority in spite of strong opposition. Additionally, the Assembly adopted a series of laws meant to ensure the political, administrative and economic unification of the new Greater Romania. Among these were laws on the organization of the Romanian Army, the judicial system, mines, energy, primary and normal schools, repression of offenses against public order (the anti-communist 1924 M√¢rzescu Law), founding the Romanian Patriarchate and restructuring the Romanian Orthodox Church. He took part in the Crown Council meeting held at Sinaia on the last day of 1925, where a debate was held regarding Prince Carol's decision to renounce his rights to the throne. Days later, the Assembly, presided by Orleanu, together with the Senate, meeting as a constituent assembly, took note of Carol's decision, proclaimed Michael as heir and established a regency. Also in 1926, a law establishing an electoral bonus was passed. In 1927, Orleanu became a senator by right. He died in Gala»õi. Orleanu was married to Valentina Gheorghiadi.

The Gishes led The Mountain Eagle in covering controversial topics such as the effects of strip mining on the Appalachian environment and political corruption. Under the Gishes' guidance, The Mountain Eagle became a prominent rural newspaper, and the pair won many awards for their journalism. Gish also founded the Eastern Kentucky Housing Development Corporation and worked to improve living conditions in Eastern Kentucky. Early life and education Gish was born Patricia Ann Burnett in Paris, Kentucky, to Georgia and Elmer Burnett. She began working in journalism early; she had her first job at age thirteen working as a proof reader for a small Paris newspaper. Gish later moved to Lexington, Kentucky and graduated from Lafayette High School and later studied journalism at the University of Kentucky. While in college, Gish worked with her campus newspaper The Kentucky Kernel and met her future husband, Tom. She also worked part-time as a proofreader for the Lexington Leader, which merged into the Lexington Herald- Leader in 1984, and later was promoted to assignment reporter. She married Tom Gish in Lexington in 1948 and graduated from college in 1949. In 1970, Gish acquired a Masters of Science in Community Development from the University of Louisville. The Mountain Eagle Pat and Tom Gish bought The Mountain Eagle from Pearl and Martha Nolan in November 1956 and took over editing the paper, and published their first issue on January 1, 1957. They changed the paper's motto from \\"A Friendly Non-Partisan Weekly Newspaper Published Every Thursday,\\" to \\"It Screams.\\" Under their leadership, The Mountain Eagle for the first time reported on the inner workings of the Letcher County government, which often caused controversy within the community and friction between the paper and city government officials. They covered controversial regional issues, such as meetings of the local school board and fiscal court which were previously held behind closed doors, strip mining, and mine safety abuses in the Appalachian coal industry. They also covered stories on a wide range of problems, including corruption, poor education, inadequate housing and poverty, though Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues, said they were protective of their readers' dignity, refusing to run photos of poor people. Their work reached both a regional and national audience, leading to changes in legislation and inspiring journalists and activists who supported The War on Poverty and increased environmental awareness. The Gishes' work often caused controversy within their community, prompting reactions from the public such as advertising boycotts and, in August 1974, a firebombing of their publication facilities. It was discovered that a local police officer paid to have the building burned after The Mountain Eagle published an article addressing unfair treatment of local youths by the Letcher County police. Tom Gish also reported that he believed a local coal company contributed funds to the arson as well. In reaction to this incident, the Gishes changed the motto of the paper from \\"It Screams\\" to \\"It Still Screams.\\" The couple was also notable for publishing the works of opinion columnists, especially women opinion columnists, from other communities in Eastern Kentucky, including the writing of Mabel Kiser, Thelma Cornett, Siller Brown, Sarah Ison, Elsie Banks, and Gaynell Begley. Although the couple worked as a team, Tom freely admitted that \\"without Pat, The Mountain Eagle would have gone under long ago.\\" Within The Mountain Eagle, Pat did most of the reporting, editing, and business aspects of the company. In addition to this work, she also was the \\"founder and director of a federally funded affordable housing initiative\\" \\" This additional job required Pat to drive to Louisville on the weekends for two years to earn her Master's degree. On top of all that, Pat also was a full-time mother of five children. As stated by Mike Clark, a former Eagle staffer, she was the \\"best multi-tasking saint of an editor, housing expert, wife and mother I have ever known...How Pat balanced all those roles without sleep or peace or rest is beyond me.\\" Pat and Tom were highly praised and respected for reporting \\"the real news, regardless of whether it was either profitable or popular ‚Äî and despite considerable risk to both life and livelihood.\\" Throughout their career in journalism, the duo worked hand in hand to publish accurate and trustworthy news, \\"regardless of the consequences.\\" Eastern Kentucky Housing Development Corporation In 1968, Pat Gish founded the Eastern Kentucky Housing Corp. The program was responsible for the implementation of programs that served to alleviate the struggles of low income families in Eastern Kentucky and Appalachia, as well as the construction of low income housing throughout the region. Pat even partnered with Yale Architecture School, employing students to help design housing affordable for the natural difficulties of Eastern Kentucky's landscape. The organization made use of funding from the Office of Economic Opportunity, Department of Agriculture, Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and Department of Labor funds.\\"Statement of Pat B. Gish, Director of Eastern Kentucky Housing Development Corporation\\", United States Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs, October 6, 1970 However, in the 1980s the federal support of these housing programs was heavily reduced. With this new development, Pat decided to oversee the merger of the EKHCDH and another similar organization, allowing her to return to a full-time position at The Eagle. Later life and death In 2001, Pat's son Ben Gish took over as editor of The Mountain Eagle, due to the declining health of Pat and Tom. Gish was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in the early 2000s. She succumbed to complications from Alzheimer's on April 13, 2014. Awards and recognition In 1983, Pat and Tom received the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award for \\"outstanding community leadership.\\" In 1985, the Gishes were acknowledged jointly in Newsweek magazine as two of its \\"100 American Heroes\\".\\"Home of the Brave: A Hundred Heroes for Our Time,\\" Newsweek, Summer 1986 (Special Edition). In 1986, the Gishes were inducted into the Mountain Heritage Hall of Fame and the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame. In 1987, the Gishes received the Environmental Policy Institute award for their work in promoting the environmental rights of the Appalachian region. In 1991, the Ralph Nader organization awarded the Gishes with the Joe A. Calloway Award for Civic Service. In 1993, the Lexington Herald-Leader awarded the Gishes with the Edwards M. Templin Award for Community Service. The couple also donated land for a community park. The University of Kentucky Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues instituted the Tom and Pat Gish Award in honor of the pair. The award is to be given to \\"rural journalists who demonstrate courage, tenacity and integrity often needed to render public service through journalism\\". The Gishes were the first recipients of the award on Feb. 28, 2005.

Her sculpture often includes assembled statues of female figures created with their heads/ faces painted black and a wide range of attached objects flowing outward including fabric, keys, found objects, and toy weapons. German serves as an activist addressing problems such as gun violence and prostitution. Her work is held in numerous permanent collections including the Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation and the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art and has been reviewed by Sculpture and discussed in The New York Times, O, The Oprah Magazine, and on NPR's All Things Considered. Her art has been featured in a wide range of galleries, museums and traveling exhibits, including the 2012 \\"African American Art 1950‚Äìpresent\\" touring exhibit from the Smithsonian Institution. She was a 2015 recipient of the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Biennial Grant. She was the winner of the 2018 Don Tyson Prize, a biannual $200,000 award from the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. https://news.artnet.com/art-world/vanessa-german-crystal-bridges-prize-1423390 German uses her art to address hate in the world while also expressing hope for the future.  Early life  Vanessa German was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and raised in the Mid-City area of Los Angeles and Loveland, Ohio by her mother, a fiber artist, quilter and costume maker. She is the third of five children. She moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 2000 and began to perform and exhibit her work locally. She describes her work as heavily influenced by her childhood in Los Angeles, where her mother encouraged the children to make their own clothes, and she was also impacted by the AIDS epidemic and drive-by shootings.  Artistic career  A self-taught artist, much of German's artwork is collage and sculpted assemblages. German's sculptural work frequently includes female figures that she calls \\"power figures\\" and \\"tar babies\\". She creates them by decorating and painting large dolls and figures, then sculpting outward, and adding a wide range of materials including, for example cowrie shell lips, plastic guns, feathers, bottle caps, seashells, toys, and vintage products. She often uses found and donated materials from her Homewood neighborhood. She describes discovering that her work included elements similar to the central African tradition of Nkisi nkondi, guardian statues pierced with nails and other materials. Her materials list for works often include both the physical (e.g. cloth, paint, keys) and non-tangible materials (e.g. \\"the names of all the dead boys that I know,\\" \\"tears\\"). Recurring themes addressed in her work include food, birds, violence, injustice, poverty, and Black Madonna imagery. In her artist statement for 2016's dontsaythatshitoutloud, she describes the impact of finding two men murdered outside her house within a four-month period. Her work includes the symbolic use of color throughout. Describing beads from one work, she said \\"If they‚Äôre red, they're holding rage and love simultaneously. If they‚Äôre white ‚Äì they're holding ghosts ‚Äì the presence of your ancestors ...and they're also holding forgiveness and peace.\\"  ARThouse and Love Front Porch  German also leads the ARThouse and Love Front Porch, a community art institution, in the Homewood neighborhood in Pittsburgh, PA. She started the ARThouse when she needed to create her art on her porch due to a low basement ceiling. When German began making large sculptures, she was heartbroken when pieces had to be taken apart to be removes from the basement. After moving to the porch, ARTHouse was born. https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/a27168640/vanessa-german-citizen-artist- pittsburgh-homewood/ Neighborhood children began gathering on her porch to watch her at work.

He has published research about strategy, competitiveness and income inequality in the United States. In 2012, with his colleague Michael Porter, Rivkin suggested that American competitiveness could be restored if companies decided to avoid offshoring to save on hidden costs like \\"lower foreign worker productivity, quality problems, and loss of intellectual property\\"; invest in teaching employable skills to high school and college students to produce suitable workers; foster innovation by funding relevant university research; offer in-person or online training to their employees; and avoid lobbying for unfair tax breaks which distort the market.

She studied at Bennington College in Bennington, Vermont but dropped out after her mother's death. Beck kept a diary, wrote poetry, and published two short stories before committing suicide in 1978. Her papers were selected for inclusion of the Smith College women and disabilities collection, as they provide insight into chronic illness and depression.  Early life and education  On April 8, 1924, Patricia Beck was born in Hell's Kitchen, New York City, New York, the third of four children. In 1933, Beck's mother remarried after her father's death in 1926, and from 1934‚Äì1938, the family relocated and lived in various locations around Europe. Beck was exposed to an idiosyncratic lifestyle through her mother's second marriage to the boxer, Paul George Swiderski. Beck, a Catholic, attended a convent school, was allowed only limited autonomy, and was not exposed to the typical peer culture of American middle-class high school students. With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the family relocated back to the United States, where Beck finished her secondary education before enrolling at Bennington College. Beck began to study writing, art, and psychology at Bennington under Theodore Roethke, W. H. Auden, and Allan Seager. In 1945, she described a self- consciousness related to a friendship she had developed with a faculty member's wife. Depression played a role in the following year, when Beck's personal life interfered with her education and felt compelled to leave school, her mother having died from cancer during her freshman year. After a stay in the psychiatric unit at Albany Hospital, she spent some time in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, before returning to Bennington. Later instructors there included Bernard Malamud, with whose family she became close and whose daughter she taught to drive.  Career  Beck kept diaries from the age of fourteen until her death, and she wrote other works throughout her life. However, only two short stories, \\"A Promise in the Wind\\" and \\"Come Down to the Willow,\\" were published while she was living. A volume of her short stories, A Gift of Kindling and Other Stories, was published posthumously. Her papers ‚Äì including correspondence, manuscripts, semi-autobiographical novels, poems, personal diaries, and notebooks ‚Äì are held by Smith College in the Women and Disabilities section of the Sophia Smith Collection. Much of the work was unpublished during her lifetime and provides rare insight into chronic illness and depression. Bernard Malamud said that he felt Beck was not meant to be a writer. She used the hundreds of rejection letters she received from such magazines as The New Yorker and The Saturday Evening Post as wallpaper for her bathroom. Personal life On June 28, 1952, Beck married Thomas Maulding, a blind man, and moved to New York City before purchasing a home, \\"Birdland\\", in North Bennington, Vermont in 1954. In 1958, she became pregnant, but miscarried. The couple divorced after that. Beck remained in \\"Birdland\\" and returned to Bennington College and continued her studies. She was diagnosed with diabetes for most of her life, and between 1976‚Äì1977, both of her legs were amputated due to complications. She was treated with shock therapy as part of psychological treatment. On March 2, 1978, Beck died by suicide when she took an insulin overdose. She was 53 years old.

He is a founding partner of Emery, Celli, Brinckerhoff Abady Ward & Maazel LLP. He was the Chair of Civilian Complaint Review Board from 2014 to 2016. Emery was part of New York Governor Mario Cuomo's State Commission on Government Integrity in the late 1980s. He was also part of the part of New York Governor Eliot Spitzer's Transition Committee for Government Reform Issues. He was a member of the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct for 13 years until March, 2017.  Early life and education  Emery was born in Boston, Massachusetts on March 5, 1946. He received a B.A. from Brown University in 1967 and received a J.D., cum laude, in 1970 from Columbia University Law School, where he was named a Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar. Following law school, he became a law clerk for Gus J. Solomon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon.  Career  After graduating from Columbia Law School, Emery moved to Washington and founded the Institutional Legal Services Project, a state- financed public-interest firm that represented people who were incarcerated in prisons, mental institutions and juvenile facilities. After directing the project for six years, he moved back to New York in 1977 and joined the New York Civil Liberties Union as a staff attorney and worked there for a decade. In 1987, Emery was offered a seat on Governor Mario Cuomo's State Commission on Government Integrity. He accepted the offer and resigned from New York Civil Liberties Union. The same year he became of counsel to Lankenau, Kovner & Bickford, and, thereafter, a partner, focusing on civil and civil rights cases at the firm. One of his most notable cases at the firm was a lawsuit charging that the Board of Estimate violated \\"one person, one vote,\\" by granting the Staten Island Borough President, who represented fewer than 400,000 people, the same power as the Brooklyn Borough President, who represented more than two million. In 1989, Emery won the case arguing in the U.S. Supreme Court and resulting in the unanimous invalidation of the Board on one person-one vote constitutional grounds. In 1996, Emery represented Laurance Rockefeller, Jr. and presidential candidate Steve Forbes in their bids to gain ballot access. Emery left Lankenau, Kovner & Bickford and founded Emery, Celli, Brinckerhoff & Abady in 1997. In 2000, he represented John McCain in his bid to gain access to the 2000 New York Republican presidential primary ballot and in 2001, Emery represented over 60,000 misdemeanor detainees in a case against New York City's strip search policy. Emery won the case and the New York City agreed to pay $50 million to 50,000 people who had been illegally strip-searched. Emery also represented the three Jackson brothers starved by foster parents in New Jersey in K.J. et al. v. Division of Youth and Family Services et al. In March 2004, Emery was appointed to the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct, by New York State Senate Minority Leader John L. Sampson, and served through to March 2016. In November 2006, newly elected Governor of New York Eliot Spitzer appointed Emery to his Transition Committee for Government Reform Issues. After Spitzer resigned in March 2008, Governor David Paterson appointed Emery to the New York State Commission on Public Integrity. In 2010, Emery won a civil-rights lawsuit in over strip searches performed on nonviolent, low-level offenders at the Rikers Island jail facility. As a result of the lawsuit, the city agreed to pay out $33 million on behalf of more than 100,000 plaintiffs. Emery represented Roger Clemens' trainer in a defamation lawsuit about steroid use and Duke Lacrosse player Reade Seligmann in a civil suit for wrongful prosecution. Emery also represented Cooper Union in a suit to restore tuition-free education. Emery was appointed as the Chair of Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) in 2014 by the Mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio. As the chairman of the CCRB, Emery had aggressive investigations conducted into police misconduct including the use of chokeholds, false statements made by police, and unlawful searches. Emery resigned from the Board on April 13, 2016.

While the automation of manual labour has been contemplated since before the industrial revolution, the issue has received increased discussion in the 21st century due to newer developments such as machine learning. Assessments of the risk vary widely, with one study finding that 47% of the workforce is automatable in the United States, and another study finding that this figure is 9% across 21 OECD countries.Arntz, M., T. Gregory and U. Zierahn (2016), \\"The Risk of Automation for Jobs in OECD Countries: A Comparative Analysis\\", OECD Social, Employment and Migration Working Papers, No. 189, OECD Publishing, Paris, https://doi.org/10.1787/5jlz9h56dvq7-en The idea of taxing companies for deploying robots is controversial with opponents arguing that such measures will stifle innovation and impede the economic growth that technology has consistently brought in the past. Proponents have pointed to the phenomenon of \\"income polarization\\" which threatens the jobs of low-income workers who lack the means to enter the knowledge-based fields in high demand.  Arguments for  Tax law professor Xavier Oberson has called for robots to be tax-compliant so that government spending can continue even as the pool of taxable income for human workers decreases. Oberson's proposals suggest taxing robot owners until robots themselves have the ability to pay, pending further advances in artificial intelligence. In a 2015 Reddit discussion, Stephen Hawking criticized machine owners for initiating a \\"lobby against wealth resdistribution\\". Following Elon Musk's statement that universal basic income should offset the employment effects of robots, Bill Gates gave an interview in favour of a robot tax. Mark Cuban announced his support for a robot tax in 2017, citing an essay by Quincy Larson about the accelerating pace of technological unemployment. Support for an automation tax by American politicians can be traced back to 1940 in which Joseph C. O'Mahoney tabled one such bill in the Senate. In 2017, San Francisco supervisor Jane Kim made these strategies the subject of a task force, stating that income disparity attributable to robots is widely visible in her district. In 2019, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio advocated for a robot tax during and after his presidential run. While crediting Andrew Yang for drawing attention to the issue, de Blasio stated that he had different policy goals and proposed making large corporations responsible for five years of income tax from jobs that are automated away. In 2017 in the UK, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called for a robot tax. Bank of England economist Andy Haldane has called the rise of automation \\"a regressive income tax on the unskilled\\".  Arguments against  Critics including Jim Stanford and Tshilidzi Marwala have discussed the futility of a robot tax given the malleability in the definition of \\"robot\\". In particular, autonomous elements are present in many 21st-century devices that are not normally considered robots. Economist Yanis Varoufakis has discussed the additional complication of determining how much a human worker would have hypothetically made in a labour sector that has been dominated by robots for decades. He has instead proposed a variation of universal basic income called the \\"universal basic dividend\\" to combat income polarization. Robotics companies including Savioke and the Advancing Automation trade group have fought robot taxes, calling them an \\"innovation penalty\\". ABB Group CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer compared taxing robots to taxing software, and pointed to the fact that countries with a low unemployment rate have a high automation rate. EU Commissioner Andrus Ansip rejected the idea of a robot tax, stating that any jurisdiction implementing one would become less competitive as technological companies are incentivized to move elsewhere. The 2019 World Development Report, prepared by Simeon Djankov and Federica Saliola of the World Bank, opposed a robot tax, arguing that it would result in reduced productivity and increased tax avoidance by large corporations and their shareholders.  Existing laws  On August 6, 2017, South Korea, under President Moon, passed what has been called the first robot tax. Rather than taxing entities directly, the law reduces tax breaks that were previously awarded to investments into robotics. A robot tax had previously been part of Mady Delvaux's bill imposing ethical standards for robots in the European Union. However, the European Parliament rejected this aspect when it voted on the law.

She uses a coiling method to create the height and shape of her pieces, after which she applies a clay slip coating and polishes until a high shine is obtained, using small quantities of lard intermittently, and carves the pieces with screwdrivers. The pots are fired in traditional open firing after being slowly pre-heated.

He plays primarily as a lock, though he can also play as a flanker, and represents Young Munster in the All-Ireland League. Early life Wycherley was born in Bantry, County Cork. At age 16, he moved to Cistercian College, Roscrea and was part of the team that won the Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Cup in 2015, beating Belvedere College 18‚Äì11 in the final and winning the trophy for the first time in the school's history. However, the following year Wycherley also tasted defeat in the competition, losing to the previous years beaten finalists, Belvedere, 31‚Äì7 in the final. Munster Wycherley was an unused substitute in Munster's fixture against Welsh side Scarlets in Thomond Park on 24 February 2017. This was his first call-up to the senior Munster team in a Pro14 fixture. On 4 March 2017, Wycherley made his competitive debut for Munster when he came on as a replacement in the 2016‚Äì17 Pro12 fixture against Cardiff Blues in Cardiff Arms Park. In Munster's 2017‚Äì18 Pro14 defeat against Glasgow Warriors on 22 September 2017, Wycherley was sent off. He was subsequently cited and banned for three weeks.

She makes intricate works on paper and canvas as well as large scale sculpture. Through a convergence of interest in anthropology, science fiction, black female subjectivity and women's work, her art explores the humor and fantasy involved in self-making within diasporic societies, which have an ability to live with cultural ambiguities and use them to build psychological and even metaphysical defenses against cultural invasions. In 2016 and 2017 she participated in group and solo museum exhibitions at the Tarble Arts Center, Eastern Illinois University, Charleston, IL, The Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh, PA, the Museum of Latin American Art, Los Angeles, CA as part of the Getty's Pacific Standard Time's LA>LA exhibition, Spelman College Museum of Fine Art, Atlanta, GA, and with the Pinchuk Art Foundation's Future Generation's Art Prize exhibition at the 2017 Venice Biennale. B√°ez has held residencies at the Headlands Center for the Arts, The Joan Mitchell Center, The Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, The Lower East Side Print Shop, and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council Workspace. B√°ez's work has been written about in The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, Art in America, New American Paintings, The Huffington Post, Studio Museum Magazine and is featured in the Phaidon contemporary drawing anthology Vitamin D2. Her work has been exhibited at the New Museum, New York, NY, the P√©rez Art Museum Miami, Miami, FL, the New Orleans Biennial Prospect.3, New Orleans, LA, Taller Puertorrique√±o, Philadelphia, PA, Ruth and Elmer Wellin Museum of Art, Clinton, NY, the Drawing Center, The Bronx Museum of the Arts, Bronx, NY and the Studio Museum, New York, NY. Her work was featured in the United States Biennial Prospect.3 in New Orleans, LA, curated by Franklin Sirmans. She has been the recipient of the prestigious Joan Mitchell Painters and Sculptors Award, the Jacques and Natasha Gelman Award in Painting, the Catherine Doctorow Prize for Contemporary Painting, and the Chiaro Award from the Headlands. In 2015 The P√©rez Art Miami Museum published Firelei B√°ez: Bloodlines, with an introduction by the museum's Director, Franklin Sirmans, an essay by Assistant Curator Mar√≠a Elena Ortiz, an interview with Naima Keith and a contribution by writer Roxane Gay.  Early life and education  Born to a Dominican mother and a father of Haitian descent, the self-described \\"Caribbean hybrid\\" was raised in Dajab√≥n, a market city on the Dominican Republic's border with Haiti. As a child, B√°ez recalls seeing the landscapes of both countries from her home, with views of Haiti's dying, deforested landscape standing in stark contrast to the verdant valleys and mountains of the Dominican Republic. Dividing the two countries is the Dajab√≥n River, the site of the 1937 massacre of thousands of Haitians at the hands of Dominican President Rafael Trujillo's brutal regime. That landscape, which has long been a vivid symbol of the violent history between the two countries ‚Äî which are again locked in a humanitarian crisis over Dominican attempts to deport thousands of Haitians ‚Äî haunts B√°ez's work. At the age of 10, she relocated with her family to Miami. The move had a profound impact on her. In the Dominican Republic, B√°ez says, racial identity was much more complicated. But in the United States, those shades of gray were suddenly gone. > \\"There's a fluidity of color, of race, in the Caribbean,\\" she says. \\"In > America, you're black or white.\\" That didn't make race less fraught. Rather, it added another layer of \\"otherness\\" to B√°ez's understanding of herself. \\"As someone born in the DR but raised mostly in the United States, I am constantly navigating ways of articulating something that is familiar but also very distant,\\" she says. B√°ez received an M.F.A. from Hunter College and a B.F.A. from Cooper Union and studied at The Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. She has had solo exhibitions at the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art, P√©rez Art Museum Miami, and the DePaul Art Museum.  Career  B√°ez's lush paintings often foreground female bodies and faces, incorporating imagery associated with various cultural symbols, from palm fronds and feathers to tufts of fur and intricate textile patterns. Rendered with the artist's precise touch, in acrylics and gouaches, her works coalesce to form powerful narratives around ancestry and cultural identity. B√°ez gained much-deserved exposure last fall with her solo museum shows ‚ÄúPatterns of Resistance‚Äù at the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art and ‚ÄúBloodlines‚Äù at Perez Art Museum Miami. ‚ÄúI looked at the idea of ancestry in a way that extended beyond the physical bloodline to explore the idea of a lineage of resistance and self-definition, which is especially tricky when you‚Äôre the product of an ahistorical narrative, as many are from the African diaspora,‚Äù B√°ez says of the Miami show, an expanded iteration of which will travel on to other institutions including the Andy Warhol Museum. ‚ÄúI started incorporating the figure into my work as a way to navigate my own sense of identity, particularly because I came from a place that didn‚Äôt fit into one specific narrative. It was a way for me to untangle what I was going through on a daily basis.‚Äù MetFridays: B√°ez's participatory installation was displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This series at the Metropolitan Museum of Art features artists leading participants in making a collaborative installation that's inspired by visitors to the museum's gift shop. Afterward, the installation remained on view through March 2016. The program was presented in conjunction with the exhibition ‚ÄúThe Power of Prints: The Legacy of William M. Ivins and A. Hyatt Mayor. Aside from museum exhibitions, B√°ez has also held numerous residencies throughout the country. She has held residencies at the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council Workspace, The Lower East Side Print Shop, and The Bronx Museum‚Äôs Artist in the Marketplace. Additional residencies include Headlands Center for the Arts, Artist in Residence, Dieu Donn√© Paper Mill, Workspace Artist in Residence, and Wave Hill, Workspace Artist in Residence.

Each canvas is proportional to a mattress set-single, full, queen, or king with corresponding pillows-and responds to the progression of the zodiac, using the elements of each sign to guide the composition. On their multicolored surfaces, various systems of symbols converge and are woven together, echoing the seemingly esoteric and illusory montage of our dreams.

Owned by the Roxbury Land Trust, it protects the site of a well-preserved 19th-century iron mine and furnace works. Several miles of trails provide access to abandoned quarry areas and the preserved remains of the iron works, whose uses are explained by informational panels. The preserve is open from dawn to dusk. The preserve was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history When Roxbury was first settled in the 18th century, the land form now known as Mine Hill was called Spruce Hill and was common land. Its stone outcrops were eventually recognized for their minerals, and a few attempts were made in the mid-18th century to extract gold, silver, and lead from the mountain. None of these efforts lasted more than a few years, but shafts dug into the hill survive from this period. In the early 19th century a geological analysis found the presence of carbonated iron ore, a rare and highly desirable form of ore that was probably unknown to the early miners. Disputes over land ownership delayed exploitation of the resource until 1865, when the Shepaug Spathic Iron and Steel Company purchased the hill and began to develop it. It set up a mining operation, with a railroad carrying ore to furnaces near the base of the hill, and built a small town for the workers. Mineral Spring Brook was dammed to create a reservoir that would provide a reliable water supply. Later in the 19th century, a granite quarry was also opened near the base of hill, its products transported by rail to market in New York City. The iron furnace and mining operation was closed in 1905, and the stone quarry closed in 1935. The preserve occupies north of Mine Hills Road in northwestern Roxbury. It occupies the eastern face of the eoponymous hill, whose summit and western portions are in neighboring New Milford. A parking area on Mine Hills Road provides access to the trails. There is a short (0.2 mile) loop leading to the area where the blast furnaces are located, and a longer 3.5-mile trail that loops through the areas where the 18th and 19th-century mining activities took place. A short 0.3-mmile trail provides access to the reservoir site.

Celender, who began producing art in the late 1960s, used surveys extensively in his work. He would send questionnaires to members of the public, academics, artists, politicians, museum officials, and other cohorts of people, often with outlandish or tongue-in-cheek suggestions or solicitations. The responses were then exhibited at the OK Harris Gallery in Manhattan, New York, where Celender had a show annually. Celender taught at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota, for over 40 years. Early life Don Celender was born in 1931 in Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania. He attended Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University, from which he graduated in 1956 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. He then attended the University of Pittsburgh, graduating in 1963 with a PhD in Art History. Career After obtaining his PhD, Celender worked in Washington, D.C., at the National Gallery of Art's education department. In 1964, he moved to Minnesota where he began teaching at Macalester College in Saint Paul. While teaching, Celender took an interest in conceptual art. As the movement was expanding in 1969, Celender began a project in which he wrote letters to various academics, politicians, philanthropists, figures in the media, and religious leaders. The letters contained impossible proposals for the addressees to implement, with the instruction that they write back to Celender explaining how they intended to realize his schemes. He received responses to some of his proposals; the Cleveland Museum of Art's director, Sherman Lee, responded to Celender's suggestion that 1,000 of Lee's museum's pieces of Asian art be airdropped across Alabama by saying that he had \\"mentally performed\\" the feat. Other letters, such as Celender's proposal to Alabama governor George Wallace that the state's white residents be painted black, the state's black residents be painted white, and that they all pose as Greek sculptures along the state's highways, went unreturned. Celender's work began to receive critical attention in the mid-1970s. He exhibited art each year from 1974 to 2004 at the OK Harris Gallery in SoHo, Manhattan. Ivan Karp, owner of the gallery, represented Celender. Celender's pieces often served to parody the self- seriousness and predictability of the world of fine art, and was deemed fun and witty for those reasons. In another letter-writing project, 1975's Museum Piece, he wrote to over 70 museums, soliciting photographs of their loading bays. The museums at Yale University and Princeton University would agree to the project only for a large donation while the Brooklyn Museum, described by art critic Dale Jamieson as itself as besieged by the community in which it is located\\", turned down Celender's solicitation on the grounds of \\"security reasons\\". In 1978, Celender produced Observations, Lamentations and Protestations of Museum Guards Throughout the World, a project described by Marc Fischer as \\"particularly ambitious\\". Celender mailed 1,200 surveys, many translated from English, to museum guards to solicit their feelings about their work, the artwork in the museums they protected, and their own relationships with art. Also in 1978, Celender created Destiny of a Name, a survey dealing with the notion that a person's name may determine their profession. Celender wrote to, among others, a psychologist with the surname Reveal, a dentist with the surname Toothman, and a colorectal surgeon named Butts. Although the responses to many of Celender's questionnaires were brief, his 1995 study Mortal Remains, a collaboration with Ricardo Bloch, resulted in lengthier responses. For Mortal Remains, Bloch and Celender asked 400 contemporary artists what they wished to happen to their bodies after death and whether they wished to bring anything with them to the resting place of their choosing. Personal life and death Don Celender was married to Ivy Celender from the late 1950s through 1995, when they divorced. Celender had one daughter, Catherine. He taught at Macalester College and headed its art department until January 2005, when he learned he had pancreatic cancer. Celender died on March 3, 2005, in Pittsburgh at the age of 73. Works alt=A black and white cover page featuring the book's title and images of two museum guards Max Kozloff wrote that Celender's lightheartedness as well as the straightforwardness of his projects and their messages made him \\"an exception in the art world\\". The majority of his art took the form of survey projects like Museum Piece, which Celender produced annually and exhibited at the OK Harris Gallery. The results of about half of Celender's surveys were bound into book form, printed in black and white on paper, though these books are difficult for members of the public to access and are not often found in secondary markets. The archive of the Arnolfini contains a sizable collection of Celender's pieces.

She is known for her vibrant colors and ghoulish or macabre imagery. According to an article in Flaunt magazine: \\"Her unique brand of painting‚Äîwhich uses acrylics ‚Äúslathered heavily‚Äù on canvas and often references works of the canon as viewed through a melted macabre filter‚Äîis at once classical and utterly contemporary.\\"  Education  Figgis graduated in 2006 from the Gorey School of Art in Wexford with a Bachelor in Fine Arts. She completed her studies in 2012 with a Masters of Fine Arts at the National College of Art and Design in Dublin, Ireland. Early career  Figgis' use of Twitter to display her artwork in 2014 caught the attention of American artist Richard Prince and introduced Figgis into the New York art scene. Olivia Parkes writes \\"An unconventional rising art star, she started her family before she started art school, and received recognition for her work online before the gallery world caught up. It's the kind of story that makes you love the internet: for bringing us the good stuff, faster than we would have gotten it otherwise.\\" Figgis made her American debut exhibition at Harpers Books in East Hampton, New York in the summer of 2014 while also publishing her first book at the same time titled Making Love With the Devil. Since 2015, she is represented by Almine Rech Gallery. From the outset, Figgis has played with the culture of upper class luxury culture portrayed in the art canon by artists such as Diego Vel√°zquez, Francisco Goya, Fragonard, √âdouard Manet, James Ensor and Fran√ßois Boucher.  Style  Genieve Figgis, Leda and the Swan (after Boucher), 2018, Acrylic on canvas, 23 x 31 inches Figgis' style strikes a balance between figuration and abstraction. Her paintings are reminiscent of 18th century Rococo style as she recreates cheery Victorian photographs, and paintings with thick paint, causing the subjects to appear as melting, zombie-like creatures. Figgis values the use of paint for its ability to surprise, and is the medium she uses to form her figures of drips and swirls giving them a ghoulish imagery in her paintings. Her paintings technique involves dripping paint onto a canvas allowing gravity and colour- bleeding along to do most of the work with subtle surface marks to create specific details and textures. Her work has been influenced by growing up in Ireland with the rules of the Catholic Church and the scenic countryside she is surrounded by in her everyday life, living in County Wicklow. Figgis believes having a knowledge of a Spirit and becoming one with nature allows one to become more connected with the Earth's energy. This expression of spiritual beliefs can be seen through her works with her use of rich colors that \\"bubble, ooze and marbleize as if alive.\\" Figgis painted a version of Leda and the Swan in 2018 after an earlier work by Fran√ßois Boucher. Figgis‚Äô contemporary version reinvents an idyllic romantic scene of lavish playfulness with a dark humor creating a scene of profanity and horror.

Blair's son, also named Samuel Blair was born in Faggs Manor, and became the second Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives. The church was rebuilt in 1846 and is now known simply as the Faggs Manor Presbyterian Church. Life Blair was born in Ulster, Ireland on June 14, 1712 to William Blair. He immigrated to the colonies in his youth. He was educated in 1730‚Äì1735 under Reverend William Tennent at the Log College, the first theological seminary serving Presbyterians in North America located in what is now Warminster, Pennsylvania (then known as Neshaminy). He was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Philadelphia on November 9, 1733 and ordained in September 1737. In the spring of 1734, he was asked to preach in the New Jersey towns of Millstone, Cranberry, Middletown, and Shrewsbury. He accepted the position in Middletown and Shrewsbury in September of that year. While in New Jersey, he was an original member of the Presbytery of New Brunswick. In June 1735, Blair married Frances van Hook, daughter of Judge Lawrence van Hook and Johanna (Smith) van Hook, who was the daughter of Hendrick Barents Smith of New York City. In 1739, he was called to Fagg's Manor, Pennsylvania but deferred to the Presbytery which advised him to accept. He returned to Pennsylvania 1739 and founded the Faggs Manor Presbyterian church and associated classical school in Londonderry Township. Many prominent Presbyterian clergy were trained there, including Samuel Davies who became the fourth President of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). It was during this time that Blair participated in the \\"New Side\\" of the division of the Presbyterian Church in Pennsylvania during the Great Awakening, embracing the revivals.. Blair's sermons, such as \\"A Perswasive to Repentance\\" are full of dense expressive figures, balanced argumentation and dialogic interludes. In his revival preaching, Blair aims at evoking negative emotions towards sinful laxness and presenting the Great Awakening as a breakthrough in the history of colonial America.. Retrieved March 4, 2017 Blair became ill while traveling to meet with the trustees of the College of New Jersey. He died in Faggs Manor on July 5, 1751 and is buried in the church cemetery.

Otherwise, the Fusen-ry≈´ school featured a complete curriculum of atemi-waza (striking techniques), nage-waza (throwing techniques) and shime-waza (choking techniques).‰∏çÈÅ∑ÊµÅÊüîË°ì History The founder of Fusen-ry≈´ was Motsugai Takeda, also known by the name of Fusen.Fumon Tanaka, Atsumi Nakashima, Serge Mol. Classical Fighting Arts of Japan: A Complete Guide to Koryu Jujutsu He was a part of the Takeda family, and after becoming a monk started training Namba Ippo-ry≈´ jujutsu with Takahasi Inobei Mitsumasa. After receiving his menkyo kaiden, he travelled around many parts of Japan in a form of musha shugyo, learning in the schools of Yoshin-ry≈´, Takenouchi-ry≈´, Sekiguchi-ry≈´, Kito-ry≈´ and Shibukawa-ry≈´, as well as the armed styles of Yagy≈´ Shinkage-ry≈´, H≈çz≈çin-ry≈´, Otsubo-ry≈´ and Yamada-ry≈´. By adopting the strong points of each style, he created his Fusen- ry≈´ curriculum. After being appointed priest of the Saihoji temple in Kyoto in 1830, he built a dojo in the nearby grounds and started teaching his style. Many martial artists heard his reputation and came to challenge him, but nobody could beat him. It was said Motsugai's students reached the number of 3000. Motsugai died in 1867, after which his school moved its influence field to Okayama. The school rose to fame again in 1891, when its headmaster Mataemon Tanabe defeated the Kodokan judoka Takisaburo Tobari in a challenge match. At the time, most jujutsu schools in Tokyo were losing place to the growing Kodokan, and the victory was shocking not only for coming from one of them, but also for how easily it happened thanks to Tanabe's personal advantage at newaza. The victory was followed by many others, and Tanabe capitalized on them to promote himself and his style by claiming his wins demonstrated the superiority of Fusen-ry≈´ over judo and not any skill on his part.Â§ñÁ∑®Ôºí‚àíÂè§ÊµÅ„Å®Ë¨õÈÅìÈ§®ÊµÅ He taught his art at the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai and at Yataro Handa's Daito-ry≈´ dojo, which went to specialize in newaza, and also shared his knowledge with judokas Yuji Hirooka and Soji Kimotsuki. Despite this, the Fusen-ry≈´ school itself never grew to significant levels, with Tanabe remaining as its only renowned exponent. Eventually his son Teruo and his most known apprentices, Taro Miyake and Yukio Tani, became members of the Kodokan.

The film was commissioned by the USSR State Committee for Television and Radio. The shooting took place in a suburb of Leningrad, near Rzhevka station. Synopsis Two hapless young people - student Vladimir Busygin and his chance friend Semyon Sevostyanov, nicknamed Silva - escort two girls they just met in a cafe back home to the suburbs in the hopes of advancing their relations. After being rejected, they run back to the train station and are late for the last train. Finding themselves in a cold autumn night in another town, they try to convince someone to let them sleep over, but to no avail. In one of the windows they see a father and son having a heated quarrel. An adventurous idea comes to Vladimir who overhears the conversation - he wants to announce himself as an illegitimate son of the apartment's dweller, and thus solve the problem with dinner and a place to sleep. Andrei Grigorievich Sarafanov, musician-clarinetist (who performs at a dance club and at a cinema before screenings), a kind-hearted man who brought up two children without his wife, acknowledges the unexpected guest as his illegitimate son. His reaction is so sincere and touching that Vladimir's conscience is awakened. In addition he grew up without a father and Sarafanov's demeanor inadvertently compels him to become imbued with mutual feelings. He can not respond to such boundless trust with fraud and suddenly realizes that the problems of the family, the existence of which he was not aware of only yesterday, are not of total indifference to him. The younger son of Sarafanov, Vassenka, with all the ardor of youth is unrequitedly in love with Natalya - a woman who lives in the neighborhood. However, Silva interferes in their uneasy relationship, who behind Vassenka's back starts to successfully woo Natalia, but only as a pleasant diversion and without serious intentions. Simultaneously with this love story another plays out: Busygin falls in love with Sarafanov's daughter Nina, but because he is her \\"brother\\" he can not openly admit this and suffers in silence, being jealous of Nina to her groom, an aviation radio engineer. In the end unable to keep up his role, Vladimir admits to Nina of his fraud, who also experienced baffling un-sisterly affinity towards her new \\"brother.\\" They discuss as to how should they inform Andrei Grigorievich about this. At this point Silva comes in: Vasya, finding him as a visitor in Natalia's home, out of jealousy tries to set fire to her house by throwing a box of lit household matches into her window. Between Silva and Busygin a quarrel breaks out, and Silva in retaliation reports the truth to her father Sarafanov. Vladimir is forced to confess everything. However, sincerely falling in love with his \\"eldest son\\", Andrei Grigorievich forgives the deception: \\"You are all my children, because I love you. Whether I am bad or good, I love you.

They are located in the Plaza del Salvador, between the church of El Salvador and the convent building of San Marcos, 220 m from the Cathedral, with direct connection from the street of Trinidad convent building of San Marcos. In the year 1997, The City Council excavated and discovered stone stairs, which are located in front of the iron stairs. Archaeological work began thus, appearing two more rooms. In the third of them they discovered a well that, surprisingly, still contains water today. It is both well, because it emanates water of itself and also cistern as it receives rainwater through 3 holes in the roof. The water that fell here was transferred by three channels to the well. It is believed that this cistern- well was blocked in its day and remained hidden since for centuries the water was a precious commodity in Toledo. It traded with it through the water carriers. Only the wealthy classes could buy clean water. The rest drank from the contaminated streams that flowed into the Tagus. They tried to purify the water by filtering it through pots of clay and boiling it. The basement consists of two rooms: \\"Entry\\" and \\"Main room\\". Chronology With respect to the historical description, it can only be noted that a superposition of the ruins of the square of El Salvador has been graphically made with the Plan of city of Ib√°√±ez Ibero of 1882, where they appear the traces of the old convent of San Marcos, built in the 16th century. In this plane do not appear data that evidences the belonging of the present ruins to that convent. Its chronology can be placed then between the 12th and 13th centuries, previous to the cloister of the convent of Trinitarios that it extended by the square.

It forms part of the Musical Instrument Museums collection of the University of Edinburgh, and is housed in St Cecilia's Hall. Its full name is the Raymond Russell Collection of Early Keyboard Instruments.  History  Raymond Russell, a British harpsichordist and organologist, bought his first historic keyboard instrument in 1939. Over the next twenty years he assembled a considerable collection of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century clavichords and harpsichords. His collection included instruments from all the main harpsichord-building areas of Europe: a number of English spinets; early harpsichords and virginals from Italy; Flemish instruments by the Ruckers; a late French instrument by Pascal Taskin; and a clavichord and harpsichord from North Germany, both by Johann Adolph Hass. Russell described many of the instruments in detail in his book The Harpsichord and Clavichord: an Introductory Study, published in 1959. By 1960 Russell had decided to donate his collection to Edinburgh University, where it was to become the nucleus of a centre for research in keyboard performance practice and organology, but this plan was not completed by the time of his sudden death in Malta in 1964 at the age of forty-one. Later that year, in his memory and in accordance with his wishes, his mother Maud Russell donated almost all of his collection ‚Äì nineteen instruments ‚Äì to the university; the donation also included his notes and his collection of documentary photographs. The collection was housed in St Cecilia's Hall in Edinburgh, which opened as a museum in 1968. The opening recital was given by Gustav Leonhardt. The university bought two further instruments from Russell's collection ‚Äì an English double harpsichord by Jacob Kirckman, bought at auction in 1970, and a French double harpsichord by Jean Goermans and Taskin, purchased from Maud Russell in 1974 ‚Äì bringing the total number to twenty-one.

While the concept of preserving federal data existed before, it gained new impetus with the election in 2016 of U.S. President Donald Trump. The concept of harvesting and preserving federal web pages began as early as 2008, at the conclusion of President George W. Bush's second term, under the name \\"End of Term Presidential Harvest.\\" \\"End of Term Presidential Harvest 2008\\" University of North Texas Digital Library, retrieved March 4, 2017 Soon after Trump's election, scientists, librarians and others in the U.S. and Canada‚Äîfearing that the administration of Trump (who had expressed doubts about the validity of the scientific consensus on the existence of climate change Kenny, Caroline \\"Trump: 'Nobody really knows' if climate change is real\\" CNN, December 12, 2016, retrieved March 4, 2017) would act to remove scientific data from government websitesDennis, Brady \\"Scientists are frantically copying U.S. climate data, fearing it might vanish under Trump\\" The Washington Post, December 13, 2016, retrieved March 4, 2017‚Äîbegan working to preserve those data.

Among the projects involved are the DataRefuge Project and the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative. Guerrilla Archiving Event: Saving Environmental Data from Trump The Guerrilla Archiving Event: Saving Environmental Data from Trump was a meeting arranged by two professors at the University of Toronto in December 2016, in an effort to pre-emptively preserve US government climate data from possible deletion by the Trump Administration. =Background= During his run for presidency, President Trump had expressed, in various occasions, climate change denialism calling the climate change as Chinese hoax \\"in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive\\", and voiced his hostility towards climate science and Paris climate agreement. In early December 2016, a prominent climate change sceptic, Scott Pruitt was selected as a new administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These proceeding had raised concerns among academic community that the scientific opinion on climate change might be suppressed during Trump's presidency. Indeed, according to Reuters sources, in 25 January 2017, Trump's administration instructed United States Environmental Protection Agency to remove climate change page from their website. =The event= Fearing for possible deletion, or alteration of the US government websites containing the government climate data, as happened in Canada,xxx people from various academic backgrounds and training such as coders, environmental scientists, social scientists, archivists, and librarians gathered together in order to save US government websites at risk of changing or disappearing during or after government transition.

She has previously held positions at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute, University of Cincinnati, Rush University, and the University of Massachusetts. Raza's research focuses on myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. Most recently, she is the author of The First Cell: And the Human Cost of Pursuing Cancer to the Last.  Early life  Raza was born in Karachi, Pakistan became interested in biology as well as evolution as a child. Raza then went to medical school in order to study biological sciences at Dow Medical College.  Academic and research positions  Raza moved to Buffalo to take a residency at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute, where she researched the biology and pathology of myeloid malignancies. At the age of 39, Raza was named a Full Professor at Rush University in Chicago. Following this she worked as Charles Arthur Weaver Professor of Cancer Research at Rush University, where she also became the first Director of the Division of Myeloid Diseases. She was later named the Director of Hematology and Oncology at the University of Massachusetts, and then the Gladys Smith Martin Chair in Oncology. Raza was also the Director of the Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) Center at St. Vincent's Comprehensive Cancer Center. Raza later became Professor of Medicine and Director of Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) Center at Columbia University.  Research  Raza's research has defined the Cell Cycle Kinetics of Myeloid Leukemia cells in vivo in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia by studying cellular proliferation in patients. This led researchers to believe that low blood counts were not a result of bone marrow failure, but instead a hyper-proliferative state in the marrow tissue, leading to their hematopoietic cells to die of apoptosis. Raza has also developed a tissue bank of cancer patients that contains several thousand specimens of patient tissue for her research, which she uses to identify treatment programs for various patients through genetic testing. This also resulted in a research partnership with the company Cancer Genetics in 2014, \\"to identify more accurate diagnostic and prognostic markers for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), as well as novel therapies to target this class of bone marrow cancers.\\" Her research into acute myeloid leukemia has shown that a mutation in their bone-building osteoclast cells of patients suffering from the disease could be one of the causes of the cancer they develop. Raza has also used genomic technology to further research the pathology of myelodysplastic syndrome, as well as RNA Sequence and global methylation studies, and was a part of US President Barack Obama's \\"cancer moonshot\\" program, reporting to Vice-President Joe Biden.  Writing  Raza's 2009 book Ghalib: Epistemologies of Elegance co-written with Sara Suleri Goodyear, analyzed the work of the Urdu poet Ghalib, and included translations of Ghalib's Ghazals that the co-authors performed themselves.http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00fwp/published/ghalibreview2009.pdf Raza also facilitates Pakistani artists during visits to New York City.http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/entertainment/30-Nov-2015/hamid-ali-khan- mesmerizes-audience-at-musical-soiree-in-new-york She also co-wrote Myelodysplastic Syndromes & Secondary Acute Myelogenous Leukemia: Directions for the New Millennium in 2001. Raza's work has appeared in The New England Journal of Medicine, Nature, Blood, Cancer, Cancer Research, British Journal of Haematology, Leukemia, and Leukemia Research. She has also contributed to newspapers as an author, and has provided talks to organizations like TEDx New York. The hypothesis that early detection and prevention of cancer may be the most humane solution for the cancer problem was summarized in Raza‚Äôs essay in The Wall Street Journal, titled: \\"Cancer is still beating us. We need a new start\\".  Critical Acclaim  Raza's 2019 book The First Cell has received critical acclaim from many sources: *The New York Times, Books to Watch For in October 2019 * Amazon, Top 100 Books of 2019 * LitHub, Most Anticipated Books of 2019 * BookRiot, Must-Read Books on Cancer * Amazon, Best Science Books of 2019 * Starred Review from Publishers' Weekly * Starred Review from Kirkus Henry Marsh in the New York Times said, \\"Raza suggests the first cancer cell that gives rise to a tumor is like a grain of sand that precipitates the collapse of a sand pile. Research, she says, should concentrate on finding these early changes, before an actual tumor develops.\\" The Times (London) reported, \\"Her most ambitious project, though, is the MDS-AML (myelodysplastic syndromes-acute myeloid leukaemia) Tissue Repository, in which tissue from every bone marrow biopsy she has taken over 35 years is banked. Founded in 1984, it‚Äôs the oldest repository of its kind created by a single physician and contains 60,000 samples from Raza‚Äôs patients, including, painfully, her husband‚Äôs.\\" Barbara Kiser wrote in Nature: \\"Each year, the United States spends US$150 billion on treating cancer. Yet as oncologist Azra Raza notes in this incisive critique-cum-memoir, the treatments remain largely the same. Raza wants to see change: eliminating the first cancer cell rather than 'chasing after the last', which is doable with current technologies. Meanwhile, she braids often-harrowing stories of patients, including her own husband, with insights gleaned from laboratory and literature on this complex, often confounding array of diseases.\\"  Personal life  Raza was married to the late Harvey David Preisler, Director of Rush Cancer Institute. They have one daughter, Sheherzad Raza Preisler, who also lives in New York.  Awards  Raza was a Hope Funds for Cancer Research honoree in 2012. She also received the Distinguished Services in the Field of Research and Clinical Medicine award from Dow Medical College in 2014.
