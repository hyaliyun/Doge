Career  Erickson received her BFA in 1982 from the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. After graduating, she worked for a year as a potter the French-Canadian section of the Busch Gardens theme park in Williamsburg. She also took a job running the ceramics studio at the Jamestown Settlement where she began to study and recreate pottery from the archaeological collections at the historic site. Erickson was the artist in resident at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, England from July to September 2012. Erickson also completed two residencies; one at the Visual Arts Center in Richmond, VA, and the other at Starworks in Star and Seagrove, NC.

Additionally, she is affiliated with the National Council on Education for the Ceramics Arts, American Craft Council, and American Ceramics Circle.  Artist's Statement  \\"My career-long fascination with ceramic history during the period of Western exploration expansion, and dominion began with exposure to archeological ceramics in the \\"colonial triangle\\" of Virginia. Fragments of British, European, Asian, and Native American pottery unearthed in the early colonial excavations embody a remarkable global convergence of cultures in clay. My practice in the rediscovery of lost ceramic techniques and the contexts of this history define my approach as a contemporary artist. I use the depth of history through the art of making to draw parallels through time such as the 18th century Staffordshire pottery industry and global design giant Nike, Wedgewood's abolitionist ceramics and 21st child slavery, the colonial discovery and obsession with fossils as prescient to our perilous addiction to fossil fuels. I make objects of the past from an imagined future in the present.\\" References Further reading * 1960 births Living people American potters American ceramists 21st-century women artists Women potters 21st- century ceramists American women ceramists ","title":"Michelle Erickson"},{"id":"53383377","text":"Nicole Awai (born 1966) is an artist and educator based in Brooklyn, New York and Austin, Texas. Her work captures both Caribbean and American landscapes and experiences and engages in cultural critique. She works in many media including painting, photography, drawing, installations, ceramics, and sculpture as well as found objects.  Early life  She was born in Port-of- Spain, Trinidad. She is of Afro-Asian ancestry.  Education  She received her Bachelor of Arts in 1991, and a 1996 Master of Fine Arts in painting and printmaking, both from the University of South Florida. In 1997 she attended Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine.  Career  Early in her career in 2000 Holland Cotter remarked in the New York Times that Awai's then figurative paintings were sourced with \\"unprettified technique and a metaphorical bent\\" and that West Indies Colonialism was her subject. He speculated that in her overlaid images representing memories of the island of her childhood, the shifting of backgrounds and foregrounds in her paintings was a good way to think about history. He noted that in the 2000 exhibition at the Studio Museum in Harlem curated by Thelma Golden, Awai shared with other artists such as Sanford Biggers a looser sort of cultural signage as well as a post-1990s identity fluidity. Rocio Aranda-Alvarado, Senior Curator at El Museum del Barrio, described her layered imagery as identity politics that include both popular culture and her own personal manual of images. In 2018 Awai became involved as an artist in the U.S. monuments dispute. Generated after the Charlottesville, Virginia demonstration of white supremacy that sparked nationwide reconsideration of monuments to the Confederacy still in existence, Awai's proposal for a new monument was one of several done by artists for a New York Times article. Her monument rendering was inspired by the Grand Army Plaza memorial arch which is a tribute to fighters for the Union, focusing on the African-American man who surveys and stands ready for battle. When the conversation about who should be represented on a public pedestal broadened to deprecation of all indigenous peoples a commission was created to re-evaluate the monuments of New York City. Cecilia Alemani, director and chief curator of High Line Art created New Monuments for New Cities and chose Awai‚Äôs rendered proposal, a street drain in the shape of a man‚Äôs torso and face that reads ‚ÄúReclaimed Water.‚Äù Carved into the metal at the bottom, a plaque of sorts, reads ‚ÄúChristopher Columbus‚Äù. ;Academic Positions From 2009 to 2015 she held the position of Critic for the Yale School of Art. She is currently Assistant Professor of painting and drawing at the University of Texas at Austin's Department of Art and Art History. ;Artist Residences *Artists in the Market Place, Bronx Museum of the Arts, (1997-1998) *Artist-in-Residence, Art Center South Florida, Miami Beach, FL.(1998) *BRIC Media Arts Fellowship Fellowship, Brooklyn, NY (1999) * Studio Museum in Harlem (1999-2000), * Artist-in-Residence, Hunter College, Art Department, New York, NY.

Ex-Trinidadians Nicole Awai and Terry Boddie (re)envision it in a Brooklyn NY gallery using elements of drawing, photography, sculpture. Historian Rocio Armanda-Alvaraz writes about their intent to reconsider minimalist art language of the1970s to bring a sophisticated yet non-narrative version of carnival, borrowing from an ethnicized and racialized past that has asserted itself, via their installation, in the present. The installation was shown at FiveMyles Gallery in Brooklyn New York. Local Ephemera, 2007 Subjects and objects depicted in action are drawn in a looser, colorful style. They contrast with the mechanical blueprint '\\"language\\" that other objects are rendered in \\"to bring clarity where there is none\\". Notable works from Local Ephemera include Specimen from Local Ephemera: Tension Springs (2004), Specimen from Local Ephemera: Drab Hanger (2007), Specimen from Local Ephemera: Castle Nut and Drama Queen (2007), and Specimen from Local Ephemera: Resistance with Black Ooze (2005) Almost Undone, 2011 was the title of an exhibition in September, 2011 at The Vilcek Foundation Gallery. The sculpture incorporated a wide variety of materials such as sprayed paper, resin, plastic, nail polish, and clay, resulting in bold, complex three-dimensional structures, which seemed to pull, stretch, and tear from the wall. in conjunction with her earlier works of her Local Ephemera series The sculpture creates its own multi-dimensional adaptation from that series, reconstituting one dimension into the next. Asphaltum Glance, 2013 was a painting on the walls of the small gallery at Alice Yard in her native Trinidad. Awai explored the origins of the viscosity and blackness that were a long-standing staples of her painting oeuvre. Through an Art Matters Grant trip in 2012 to Le Brea a childhood memory of a nearby pitch lake resonated with her so she photographed close-up details of it as the basis for wall sized paintings for the gallery. Speaking about the connection between the black ooze and Caribbean identity, Awai says, \\"The pitch lake is constantly replenishing itself, just like us, taking on new form.\\" According to Awai, asphalt is, \\"literally the remnants of all of us, the decomposition of all flora and all fauna over the course of known time that keeps turning, churning and revealing at the same instance material and items randomly from yesterday and four hundred years ago.\\" Before leaving Trinidad, Awai painted over Asphaltum Glance as a way of continuing her themes of \\"regeneration and malleability.\\" Notes for Material Re-pose, 2016 Critical Practices/ 21st Projects, New York, NY was the exhibition site for a sculpture intended to make viewers aware of their own material present/ presence, Awai posited a continual back and forth between narrative and matter in immediate time and perpetual history. She chose these exhibits for their \\"informal viewings\\" of artists' works, intending to set up the normative space for cultural consumption and bring the audience into a domestic setting.\\" Vistas, 2017 shown at Leslie Heller Gallery consists of a series Awai had been working on since 2013. As a mental view of a succession of remembered events they were partially focused on the characteristics of asphalt ooze of her prior work. ‚ÄúVistas are momentary glimpse experiences. There is a feeling of impermanence, of possible shift, change or impending disappearance, illusive physicality that may actually be imagined and ephemeral. Vistas could be windows to the past, the future or even moments in the present that cannot be specified.‚Äù Material Re-pose, 2017 In an accompanying essay historian Dorota Biczel draws attention to Awai's abrupt transformational shifts of image, patterning and materials within the same work. Awai's juxtaposition of the infinity of the black ooze, the suggested locality of the rendered skins of animals, as well as the here and now of her own figurative likeness continue her signature premise of the complexity of matter and historical narrative. Persistent Resistance of the Liquid Land, 2018 In an installation inspired by a singular crouching black scout in a Brooklyn Civil War monument of otherwise standing group of white soldiers, ‚ÄúPersistent Resistance‚Äù consists of a central speckled, decorative column that looks like a Rorschach ink blot. Beneath it pooled on the floor, as if still in the process of cooling, is a pour of asphalt, resin, charcoal, nail polish over foam. Repeating butterfly-like paper shapes in dark blue, black, and gray hover around the column, often with a gray-tone image of the crouching soldier in the middle of them evoking cherubim or etherial figures. Also in the same year, The New York Times asked artists to propose alternatives to Confederate monuments being removed from public spaces. Awai's proposal was inspired by the Grand Army Plaza memorial arch which is a tribute to fighters for the Union. Focusing on the African- American man who surveys and stands ready for battle, she creates a winged soldier waiting to do battle for a better future. Envisioning the Liquid Land, 2019 A solo exhibition of painted relief works on paper. Purposely ambiguous spatial familiarities in multitude of parts combine into a complex mixture of visual and symbolic elements. Awai states ‚ÄúThe history of the Americas is about malleability; the shaping and reshaping of resources and culture. It is an evolving, and revolving phenomena of transformation through the movement of bodies and materials,‚Äù References External links *Official Website 1966 births Living people University of South Florida alumni Trinidad and Tobago women artists Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture alumni Artists from Brooklyn University of Texas at Austin faculty American installation artists American women installation artists ","title":"Nicole Awai"},{"id":"53383386","text":"Hickam may refer to: ;Surname *Homer Hickam (born 1943), American author, Vietnam veteran, and a former NASA engineer October Sky: The Homer Hickam Story, 1999 American biographical film *Horace Meek Hickam (1885‚Äì1934), pioneer airpower advocate and officer in the United States Army Air Corps ;Places *Hickam Air Force Base (formerly Hickam Field), United States Air Force installation *Hickam Housing, Hawaii, census-designated place in the City & County of Honolulu, Hawaii, United States See also *Hick (disambiguation) *Hickman (disambiguation) *Whickham ","title":"Hickam"},{"id":"53383411","text":"Oak's Inn Military Reservation was a coastal defense site located in Misquamicut, Rhode Island in the town of Westerly, overlooking Misquamicut State Beach.

The shrine is notable as it is jointly used for worship by members of both faiths, while both communities also display reverence for the nearby Indus River at the shrine. Background Sindhi Muslims believe the saint interred at the shrine is Sheikh Tahir - who they believe was a Hindu convert to Islam born as Odero Lal. Hindus also revere the interred saint as Odero Lal, but offer a different explanation for his origins. Hindus also refer to the saint in the shrine as Jhulelal, a name which Sindhi Muslims also use to refer to Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, whose shrine is in Sehwan Sharif. It forms the seat of the Daryapanthis, originally a sub- sect of the followers of Gorakhnath, who belong to the Nath tradition. Both communities also refer to the saint by the alternate and religiously-neutral term Zinda Pir, or \\"The Living Saint.\\" The complex is home to both a Muslim shrine and Hindu temple. The joint arrangement was devised as a compromise to stem any conflict that might arise regarding by which religious tradition the corpse should be disposed of.  Worship  The shrine caretakers hail from both the Muslim and Hindu communities. In the evening, Muslims offer namaz prayers at the shrine while Hindus perform aarti and puja prayers. At the temple, a lamp is kept burning perpetually. On the new moon days, lamps are lighted and the shrine deity, an avatar of Varuna, is worshipped at the nearby river, or other water bodies, with rice, sugar-candy, spices and fruits. Significance =For Muslims= According to Muslim tradition, Sheikh Tahir was born as a Hindu by the name of Odero Lal (alternatively spelled Udero Lal), but converted to Islam as a teenager. Odero Lal in his youth was said to have been fiercely opposed to the Hindu caste system, and as a result, attracted the attention of a Sufi saint from Multan, whose association then lead Odero Lal to convert to Islam and adopt the name Sheikh Tahir. =For Hindus= Hindus commonly refer to Odero Lal as Jhulelal. According to Hindu tradition, a tyrannical ruler named Mirkh Shah from nearby Thatta ordered that local Hindus convert to Islam within 24 hours. Local Hindus, fearful of this edict, prayed at the banks of the Indus River, where they then saw a vision of the Hindu deity Varuna who informed the worshippers that he would re-incarnate himself as an infant to be born in Nasirpur in order to deliver them from their hardships. The underside of the shrine's dome is decorated with mirror- work known as ayina kari. The baby Jhulelal was then born on the first day of the Hindu month of Chaitra. Upon hearing of the infant's birth, Mirkh Shah commanded a Hindu minister named Ahirio to kill the infant with a poisoned rose petal. When Ahirio saw the infant, Jhulelal smiled and the poisoned rose petal blew out of Ahirio's possession. When Ahirio caught sight of Jhulelal for a second time, he was startled to see that the infant had grown into an elderly man. The elderly man was then said to have turned into a young man, and then a warrior on horseback before Ahirio's eyes. Ahirio returned to recount the story to Mirkh Shah, who then lambasted Ahirio, and told him to leave and call out for Jhulelal in villages and by the banks of the Indus River. Upon calling for Jhulelal, the warrior on horseback appeared out of the river to appear to Ahirio with an accompanying army. Terrified, Ahirio begged Jhulelal to restrain his army. Jhulelal's army then disappeared back into the river, while Ahirio went back to the palace to recount the story to Mirkh Shah. Mirkh Shah remained skeptical, but invited Jhulelal to his court with intent to forcefully convert Jhulelal. Jhulelal is then said to have vanished, leaving Mirkh Shah enraged. Mirkh Shah then ordered that all Hindus immediately convert to Islam. The Hindus then rushed to the house in Nasirpur where Jhulelal was born, and found Jhulelal there as an infant. The infant consoled the distraught Hindus and commanded them to assemble at a temple near the Indus River. Upon assembling, a firestorm broke out and engulfed Mirkh Shah's palaces. The king escaped to the banks of the river, where he found Jhulelal, now again a warrior, and his Hindu followers protected from the firestorm. The king fell at Jhulelal's feet, and Jhulelal dismissed the storm with the movement of his hand. Jhulelal is also believed by Sindhi Hindus to have performed miracles, such as entering the Indus river at Nasirpur, and coming up at Bukkur, at the northernmost extent of Sindh.

Episodes  =Episode One: The Beginning= This episode, exploring theories of how the universe came into being, outlines the realisation of Edwin Hubble that the universe is expanding, and the discovery of the residual radiation that gave weight to the Big Bang theory. It also highlights some lesser known theorists including Georges Lema√Ætre, who first theorised that there was a big bang, Ralph Alpher, who stated that the light from this should be detectable, and Cecilia Payne, who calculated that hydrogen and helium were the dominant elements in the universe. The episode concludes at the Large Hadron Collider, where physicists create matter in a similar manner to the Big Bang. =Episode Two: The End= This episode explores the theories of the big crunch, the big rip and the big freeze, that are postulated by physicists as possible fates for the universe. Al-Khalili indicates that the difficulty in understanding this is our limited ability to comprehend something of such immensity both physically and philosophically. So, rather than suggesting an answer, he provides the historical background for how we came to know what we know, such as how elements are forged inside stars and how gravity provides the key to the fate of the universe, and what we don't know, such as the nature of dark matter and dark energy.  Reception  Jack Seale, writing for The Guardian, commends the Al-Khalili for, \\"his usual mix of spectacular locations, clear explanations, a few gags and the stories of scientists who made crucial breakthroughs.\\" Gary Rose, writing for RadioTimes however points out that while Al-Khalili is \\"as watchable as ever\\", this series, unlike his earlier series Atom, covers well-trodden ground and while there are \\"oodles of graphs and stats,\\" which he explains, \\"with seemingly effortless lucidity,\\" regular viewers of Horizon, \\"might be immune to the barrage of cosmic stats.\\"  References   External links  The Beginning and End of the Universe at OpenLearn * 2016 British television series debuts 2016 British television series endings 2010s British documentary television series BBC high definition shows BBC television documentaries about history BBC television documentaries about science British documentary films British films British documentary television series Documentary films about the history of science Historical television series History of electrical engineering English-language television shows ","title":"The Beginning and End of the Universe"},{"id":"53383848","text":"Ordrup Asyl, later Kong Christian IX's Asyl and now Kong Christian Den Ix og Dronning Louises B√∏rnehave , is a daycare established in the 1860s in Ordrup to the north of Copenahgen, Denmark.

The escaped gas rose and was released into Earths atmosphere after clearing the surface. An estimated that 6 - 8.8 million litres (210,000 - 310,000 cubic feet) of natural gas was being released from the damaged pipe per day. The pipeline operator, Hilcorp Energy, has said that there is presently too much sea ice to safely launch a repair mission. They added that shutting off the flow of natural gas through the pipeline would compound the problem, because the pipe had previously been used to transport crude oil and the residual crude in the pipe would then be exposed to the sea water once the pipeline was depressurized. The leak was first reported in February 2017, but an investigation by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration states that the leak may have begun in December 2016. The leak was reported to be dry natural gas being sent to the platforms as fuel, which consists of 99% methane. Divers reported that the leak was caused by the pipeline being laid across a rock on the ocean floor, resulting in a small hole. Non-profit organizations representing the environment have either sued or expressed interest in suing Hilcorp Energy, claiming that the ongoing situation is a danger to beluga whales and other marine life. The leak was repaired April 13, 2017 when divers were able to install a clamp on the leaking pipe. Litigation and state response The Alaska-based environmental organization Cook Inlet Keeper has sent a letter to Hilcorp Energy, stating their intent to sue the energy company, for what the group alleges are violations of the Clean Water Act. The Center for Biological Diversity further alleges that Hilcorp Energy is in violation of four federal laws. In addition to the Clean Water Act, the Center maintains that Hilcorp is violating the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act and the Pipeline Safety Act in a letter to the company announcing the Centers planned litigation against them. In addition, the administration of Alaska Governor Bill Walker, through the cabinet-level Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC), has demanded that Hilcorp Energy closely monitor the environmental impact of the ongoing leak. ADEC has also requested that Hilcorp hire specialists to look for dead fish and other marine life in the area, and to come up with a repair plan by March 8, 2017.

Background Brett Darren Lee was born to James D. Lee and Karen Arnold (died December 18, 2018), to a southern White American family. According to Lee, after his parents broke up, his mother relocated from the then more prosperous \\"North County\\" of St. Louis County, Missouri, to the more multiracial South Side at Shaw, St. Louis and entered into an interracial relationship, baring several mixed-race half-siblings for Lee. In the 2000s, several of Lee's close family members have been killed in gang-related shootings; his sister's boyfriend, Shelby Polk III, an African-American man, was killed in Soulard on July 19, 2015 as part of a shooting.

He studied under Abdul-Rahman Baseer, Ali al-Timimi (associated with the Virginia jihad network) and Anwar al-Awlaki (a leader within al-Qaeda). In 2007, Lee authored a ten post blog series entitled The Rise and Fall of the Salafi Movement, which focused mostly on black converts to Salafism in the United States, in a lineage of interest in Islam which he traced from Malcolm X onward. Lee's writing about the movement, which was mostly \\"lamentful\\", portrayed a disillusionment with what it described as Salafists separation from \\"the real world\\", divisions, descent into religious-extremism, and control by Saudi Arabian Islamic scholars who were ill-equipped to advise and guide on American social and cultural matters. During this time, Lee's blog won the award for \\"best series\\" in the Brass Crescent Awards. This led to a feud with Dawud Adib, an African-American who had converted in the 1970s; he authored The History of the Salafi Da'wah in America in response, accusing Lee of being federal informant or an \\"agent provocateur\\", saying that Lee was \\"a criminal\\". Adib emphasised the need for \\"pious steadfastness\\", while Lee was more interested in mixing Islam with \\"social activism\\" and secular engagement (similar politically to the Muslim Brotherhood approach). In the aftermath of the War on Terror, Lee was investigated by the FBI accused of \\"connections to terrorists\\" (namely al-Timimi and al-Awlaki), however he was cleared of all charges put against him. By 2010, Lee completed his drift away from Salafism and began to associate himself religiously with the Sufism of Mubarak Ali Gilani, the community in which his then wife was reared, before concluding they exhibited the same type of religious-extremism and isolationist tendencies Lee had found with the Salafi community. By 2013, Lee announced in a YouTube video in which he denounced Islam and Islamic societies completely that he was leaving the religion and converting to Baptism, a Protestant sect, before changing back again to Islam a few days later. In 2017 Lee criticized the Georgetown Islamic Studies Professor Jonathan Brown after he attended his lecture on slavery. Political activity Lee, while working as a cab driver, campaigned against the introduction of ride-share companies to the St. Louis Market. In 2014, Lee covered the Ferguson Unrest and was interviewed on several national outlets.

Biography  Pagliuso was born in California in 1941. She received her bachelor of fine arts from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1963. Pagliuso's father raised chickens and her mother loved her flower garden. Her father's love for chickens influenced her work. Pagliuso has lived in New York and Los Angeles throughout her career. She now lives with her husband,Tom, and her daughter, Jesse, in Santa Fe, New Mexico and New York.  Career  Pagliuso worked as the assistant art director for Mademoiselle Magazine. She also worked at the office of interiors for Morganelli Heumann and Associates. In 1969, Pagliuso started her career in photography. She moved to New York in 1974. For the next 30 years, her photographs were printed in magazines including House & Garden magazine, Interview magazine, Italian Harpers Bazaar, Italian Vogue, Mademoiselle, Men's Journal, Newsweek, New York Times Magazine \\"fashion of Times,\\" New York Magazine, Rolling Stone, Seventeen, Time Magazine, and Vogue. She worked on assignments for fashion editor Anna Wintour for 10 years and worked with many actors and celebrities such as Jessica Lange, Meryl Streep, Jack Nicholson, and Robert Redford among others. Other collaborations include working with Robert Altman, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios, Warner Brothers, 20th Century Fox, and Disney. While working with Robert Altman, she shoot stills on the sets of Thieves Likes Us, Buffalo Bill and the Indians, Nashville, and Popeye.  Photography  The Poultry Suite is one of her most well-known photographic series. The Poultry Suite is a collection of photographs of chickens. She decided to take these chicken portraits in honor and memory of her father after his passing. He had raised chickens that were shown annually in the Pomona State Fair (now L.A. County Fair) when she was a little girl. Shooting with a Hasselblad camera in her Chelsea, Manhattan studio, Pagliuso photographed chickens from an animal talent agency since all of her fathers chickens had been given away by the time she decided to start the project. She uses a low shutter speed and open aperture giving the images a softer quality. In order to achieve an effect of graphite drawings, she prints the images onto handmade Thai Mulberry paper in her darkroom. A process that is delicate and labor-intensive.  Exhibitions  The Poultry Suite series of work has been shown at the Mary Ryan Gallery in New York frequently, most recently as a retrospective titled \\"In Plain Sight\\" and was turned into a monogram published by Hirmer Publishers. The series was also featured in a retrospective solo exhibition, \\"Poultry, Raptors, Places of Ritual\\" at the Florida Museum of Photographic Arts in Tampa. The Drawing Room also showed the work in a notable 2006 show of The Poultry Suite, and again in 2009 with an addition of The Raptor Suite, that included the addition of seven owl photographs.

She is considered a writer, a visual anthropologist, and a filmmaker.  Biography  Roxanne Varzi was born in Iran to an American mother and an Iranian father. Her family migrated to the United States after the Iranian Revolution in 1979. She moved back to Iran in 1991 to continue her education at the American University in Cairo in Cairo, Egypt. She completed her PhD in 2002 at Columbia University for anthropology. Due to her Iranian roots, many of her works focus on post-Revolution Iran public culture. She expresses her art through many forms of media, including, but not limited to, films, books, and sound performances. She was the first recipient of the Fulbright award to Iran since the Revolution. Even though many of her works are focused on Iranian culture, she has expanded her work to tackle universal issues concerning war.  Career  Roxanne Varzi is currently a full professor of anthropology and film and media studies at University of California, Irvine. While at the University of California, Irvine, she has completed many works. Her first book, Warring Souls: Youth, Media, and Martyrdom in Post-Revolution Iran (2006) focuses heavily on how propaganda and media take a role in shaping the identities of those living in post-Revolution Iran. The author says this that her book focuses on \\"the intersection of religion, vision, and power, and whether the individual ultimately has the power to turn an image off\\". Her second work, Plastic Flowers Never Die (2008) which is an experimental documentary on the effects of the war in Iran, and the aftermath of the war. In this documentary, she speaks to mural painters, museum curators, and veterans to get a thorough breakdown of war and how the post-war period has been affected by the war. Plastic Flowers Never Die was selected for 14 film festivals. The Whole World Blind (2011) was her first sound performance. It is said to be experienced while the audience is \\"blindfolded and wearing headphones\\". The audience listens to a \\"narrative loop of a curator describing a slide show of war photography\\". Her second book, Last Scene Underground: An Ethnographic Novel of Iran (2015) is a fictional story set in Iran's Green Movement about young Iranians learning life lessons \\"through politics, art, and the meaning of home\\". Last Scene Underground was a gold medalist in the 2016 Independent Publisher Book Awards.

It is named after composer Heitor Villa-Lobos, and is located next to Pinheiros River. It was created in 1989 on a site that was previously used as a rubbish tip. The park now has around 37,000 trees. It hosts the annual Aberto de S√£o Paulo.  Location  The park is located the Alto de Pinheiros district to the west of the centre of S√£o Paulo.  History  In the late 1980s the area where the park is now located was used as a rubbish tip. The western area was used by the Companhia de Entrepostos e Armaz√©ns Gerais do Estado de S√£o Paulo (Company of Warehouses and General Warehouses of the State of S√£o Paulo, CEAGESP) for their garbage disposal, and around 80 families were scavenging for food and packaging there. The central part was used as a waste dump for civil construction, and the eastern part was used to hold dredged material from the Pinheiros river. The first studies to turn the area into a park were carried out in 1987 as part of the centenary of Heitor Villa-Lobos's birth. State decrees allocated to create the park, dedicated to leisure, culture and sport. The Departamento de √Åguas e Energia El√©trica (Department of Water and Electric Power, DAEE) started to clear the site in 1989, removing the families that were living there, and of debris that was larger than diameter. The site was landscaped by moving of earth. The Boa√ßava creek, which runs through the site, was channelized. The new park was designed by D√©cio Tozzi, with a \\"music city\\" theme. The administration of the park was changed in January 2004 to the Secretaria do Meio Ambiente (State Department of Environment, SMA) of S√£o Paulo state, with emergency maintenance carried out at the park in the same year, and the possibility of extending the park was started to be investigated. In 2011 plans were announced to expand the park by 20% by incorporating a area currently used for the construction of Line 4 of the S√£o Paulo Metro. Around 5,000 people visit the park each day during the week, around 20,000 people during weekends, and around 30,000 people during holidays.

Its unusual rear fuselage gave a wide field of downward machine gun fire. Only two examples were built. Design and development In 1930, the French government set out several programmes for colonial aircraft to police their overseas territories. Covering single and multi-engine designs, all were to be all- metal and powered by the Lorraine 9Na Algol radial engines, these contracts required two prototypes of each type, each shown to be capable of flight. Nieuport-Astra offered two types, the three-engined Nieuport-Delage NiD 590 and the smaller, single-engined NiD 690, which had much in common. Both had the angular appearance of the earlier single-engined NiD 540 airliner. The Nid 590 also had very similar dimensions to the NiD 540 but both newer designs differed from the earlier one in their novel rear fuselage structure. The NiD 690 was a high wing, cantilever monoplane, with wings which were trapezoidal in plan. Its Algol engine was in the nose within a narrow-chord, Townend ring type cowling and behind it the forward and central metal-covered fuselage was, apart from the roof, flat-sided and rectangular in section. The pilots' enclosed cockpit was under the wing leading edge with all-around glazing of the multi-panel type and with lower side windows for better downward vision. Colonial aircraft were expected to fill a variety of roles, including transport, bombing, reconnaissance, observation, policing and medical, so needed a large and reconfigurable internal space. Since policing involved observation of and intervention in ground events, clear views and wide fields of machine gun fire were required. As on the NiD 590, Nieuport provided a long cabin behind the cockpit with windows on each side under the mid-wing and the trailing edge; towards the rear of the cabin its walls came closer together until they met the rear fuselage, which was T-shaped in section and built from three longerons, with T-shaped bulkheads and metal covering. Long wall openings towards the rear of the cabin allowed a gunner at its narrow convergence to fire backwards and downward as well as to the sides. The tail of the NiD 690 was conventional and angular, with its trapezoidal tailplane and narrow, rectangular elevators mounted at the top of the fuselage. Its fin was triangular and the rudder was almost rectangular. It had a conventional, fixed undercarriage with each mainwheel on a V-strut hinged from the lower fuselage longeron and a long, vertical shock absorber strut to the wing. The prototype made its first flight in June 1934 but in CEMA (the Centre d'Essais de Mat√©riels A√©riens at Villacoublay) trials it was judged overweight for the available power. The second prototype flew three months later, with its fuselage lengthened by and an extended elevator to rectify directional instabilities. Both NiD 690s had been retired by the end of 1934; the SPCA 80 was the only other single-engined competitor on the 1930 programme and it, too, was rejected for production.

W. Lamb of the Paragon Feature Film Company. The melodrama was shot in Columbus, Georgia, in March 1915 and included flashback scenes depicting the Battle of Columbus also known as \\"Last Battle of the Civil War\\", fought in Columbus on April 16, 1865. It is the first movie known to be shot in the city. The story was similar to several other movies produced by Paragon around this time including The Lumberjack (1914), filmed in Wausau, Wisconsin and The Blissveldt Romance (1915) filmed in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The film was first shown during the Homecoming festivities of April 14‚Äì17, 1915, that coincided with the 50th anniversary of the battle. In all likelihood, it would have been seen by witnesses of the actual event. After touring the country, the film was returned to Columbus where it was shown again in November 1916. The Homecoming of 1916 appears to be the last time the film was shown in public.  Plot  In the film, young Dorothy Watkins meets Richard Wentworth through an automobile accident. They meet again at the country club golf course. Richard calls on her at her home (represented by Dinglewood) and meets her family. The couple tours Columbus and sees the many things the community has to offer its residents including the Ralston Hotel, St. Elmo (the house of Augusta Evans Wilson), parks and factories. They also meet an aging soldier at the Confederate monument who tells them stories of the Civil War, including its last major military engagement, the Battle of Columbus. After meeting again at a dance, Richard asks for Dorothy‚Äôs hand in marriage but, her father refuses to give his blessing. The couple plans to elope by boating across the Chattahoochee River to the Alabama side. The boat overturns, sending the couple over the falls and presumably to their deaths. The couple survives and her father gives his blessing for their union. They marry at Trinity Episcopal Church and the film ends with the couple sailing off on the riverboat W.C. Bradley.

Together with Edith Behring and Fayga Ostrower, she is part of the generation of Brazilian women engravers that art historian Geraldo Edson de Andrade calls the \\"matriarchy of engraving in Brazil\\".  Career  Katz began her career in the 1940s, primarily painting portraits and landscapes of Rio de Janeiro. In 1946, she started to take woodcutting lessons with the Austrian printmaker Axl Leskoschek . Between 1947 and 1950, Katz attended college at the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes in Rio de Janeiro, focusing her studies on painting. She went on to get a licentiate degree in drawing from the College of Philosophy of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Persuaded by a friend, the artist Poty Lazzarotto, Katz studied metal engraving with Carlos Oswald at the Rio de Janeiro School of Arts and Crafts. Throughout the 1950s, she continued to work with metal engraving but switched to woodcutting and lithography for most of her career and only returned to engraving in the 1980s. After moving to S√£o Paulo in 1951, Katz taught painting and print making at the S√£o Paulo Museum of Art from 1952 to 1955, and at the Armando √Ålvares Penteado Foundation from 1953 to 1963. During this period, from the late 1940s to mid 1950s, she mostly dedicated herself to woodcut and linocut working. She produced figurative prints with a strong social appeal in the style of social realism, portraying marginalized members of the Brazilian population, including migrants, farm workers and slum dwellers. In the 1960s, Katz adopted a more abstract style which she continued for the rest of her career. She dedicated herself to painting and drawings, embarking on a study of color through serigraph printing. To obtain the desired effects, Katz engraved up to five matrices and applied up to eight different colors to make multiple impressions of a single print. Of this process, she said: \\"color emerged from the evolution of the work, and the multiplication of the matrices brought the possibility of exploring various tonal values.\\" During the 1970s, Katz started working with lithography, which became her favoured medium. In 1965, Katz becomes a professor at the School of Architecture and Urbanism at the University of S√£o Paulo, the same institution where she obtained her master's and doctoral degrees. Her 1979 master thesis was the first scholarly work at the University of S√£o Paulo presented as a series of serigraphs. Similarly, her 1982 doctoral thesis consisting of 13 lithographs was the first non-verbal dissertation presented in her department. Diminishing health made Katz give up printmaking, shifting her focus to watercolors. \\"Since engraving demands physical strength, with time it became increasingly hard to work with it\\", she claimed.

She has received numerous awards, including for exemplary design research from the National Endowment for the Arts, career award from the Environmental Design Research Association (EDRA), and a Guggenheim Fellowship. Her co-edited (with Carolyn Francis) volume People Places: Design Guidelines for Urban Open Space received a Merit Award from the American Society of Landscape Architects in 2000 and Healing Gardens: Therapeutic Benefits and Design Recommendations (co-edited with Marni Barnes) won the EDRA Award for Place Research in 2000. Marcus advocates post-occupancy evaluation as a research method for studying public and semi-public open spaces. In her studies of Easter Hill Village in Richmond, California and St. Francis Square in San Francisco, she saw that semi-public open spaces in cluster housing foster a sense of community. She found these spaces to be well-used by residents, particularly by children. Her articles and book (with Wendy Sarkissian) Housing as if People Mattered: Site Design Guidelines for Medium- Density Family Housing published by the University of California Press in 1986 showed how medium density, low-rise cluster housing is supportive of families with children and a catalyst in building social networks. Marcus expanded her studies on open spaces in housing to other types‚Äîneighborhood and city parks, plazas, and campus open spaces in her edited volume (with Carolyn Francis) People Places: Design Guidelines for Urban Open Space first published by Van Nostrand Reinhold in 1990. She translated her findings in performance guidelines that would aid the designer and bridge the gap between research and practice. The formative years of Marcus' childhood were spent in Buckinghamshire countryside during World War II where her family was evacuated from London. There she was free to explore the landscape and developed a lifelong affinity for the natural outdoors. She encouraged her design students to remember their own childhood environments and write their environmental autobiography to discover hidden biases while designing for their clients. Marcus' work shows the impact of human potential movement in California in the 1960s. She attended seminars in the Carl Jung Institute in San Francisco and the Esalen Institute in Big Sur to delve deep into topics such as the age of Aquarius, sacred geometries in the landscape, self-transformation and becoming whole through integration of feminine and masculine archetypes. She wrote about the garden as a symbol of the higher self and the role of gardening in creating the spiritual community of Findhorn in Scotland. She adapted the Gestalt role playing therapeutic technique in her research on house as symbol of the self that was published as the book The House as a Mirror of Self: Exploring the Deeper Meaning of Home published by Conari Press in 1995. Marcus' own environmental autobiography and analysis of her self and growth are contained in Iona Dreaming: The Healing Power of Place, A Memoir published by Nicholas-Hays, Inc. in 2010. In this book written after a double bout with cancer, she reveals the remarkable power of place to heal psychological wounds and restore the spirit. Marcus has continued her research on restorative environments in the book (with Marni Barnes) Gardens in Healthcare Facilities: Uses, Therapeutic Benefits, and Design Recommendations published by The Center for Health Design, Inc. (Martinez, California) in 1995; in the edited volume (with Marni Barnes) Healing Gardens: Therapeutic Benefits and Design Recommendations published by John Wiley & Sons in 1999; and the book (with Naomi Sachs) Therapeutic Landscapes: An Evidence-Based Approach to Designing Healing Gardens and Restorative Outdoor Spaces published by John Wiley & Sons in 2014. She advocates designing salutogenic' urban spaces that promote health.

Scharschmidt Bruce F. Scharschmidt (born March 6, 1946) is an American physician-scientist whose career has spanned academic, business and non-profit sectors. He was a major contributor to the advancement of liver transplantation.  Personal life  Scharschmidt was born in East Cleveland, Ohio. He now lives in San Francisco, California with his wife, Peggy S. Crawford M.D.  Education and academic career  Scharschmidt graduated from Shaw High School in East Cleveland and completed his undergraduate and medical education in Northwestern University‚Äôs Honors (6-year) Program in Medical Education. After completing his residency training in Internal Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) in 1972, Scharschmidt worked for three years as a Clinical Associate at the National Institutes of Health, where he was a founding member of the Liver Disease Research Branch of NIDDK. Scharschmidt returned to UCSF in 1975 for subspecialty training in gastroenterology, and in 1977 joined the UCSF faculty. In 1985, he became a Professor of Medicine and, in 1990, was named Chief of the Gastroenterology division. While at UCSF, for two decades Scharschmidt led an independent NIH- funded research laboratory focused on liver physiology and the pathophysiology of liver disease. His research team elucidated cellular mechanisms of bile formation, including characterization of the hepatic uptake of organic anions such as bilirubin, demonstration that hepatic update of bile acids is sodium- coupled and electrogenic, identification of the presence on the basolateral hepatocyte membrane of a sodium-coupled bicarbonate transporter critical to intracellular pH regulation, and reporting of the initial evidence that hepatic bile acid secretion is mediated by an ATP-dependent transporter (later identified and shown to be mutated in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2). His team also collaborated in the identification of the gene that is responsible for progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1, previously known as Byler's disease, as well as benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis. Scharschmidt was an invited speaker at the 1982 NIH Consensus conference on Liver Transplantation, he reviewed and presented the results of liver transplantation, which at that time was carried out in only four centers worldwide, and authored the then definitive article on liver transplantation outcomes. The NIH Consensus Conference concluded that liver transplantation was no longer experimental, which paved the way for its reimbursement and availability at centers throughout the US and worldwide. Subsequently, with his UCSF colleagues in surgery, Scharschmidt helped launch the UCSF liver transplant program. As a member of the Training and Workforce Committee of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, he worked with his colleagues to set current standards for training in hepatology.  Mentoring  More than 15 individuals trained directly with Scharschmidt, several of whom became gastroenterology division chiefs, and/or deans and dozens more completed the UCSF gastroenterology training program for which he was responsible. He authored an invited article on the topic of mentoring for Gastroenterology.  Business career  In 1996, Scharschmidt moved to Chiron Corporation, where he served as Corporate VP responsible for the clinical development of both therapeutics and vaccines until its acquisition in 2006 by Novartis, where he remained for two years. While at Chiron and Novartis, his team was responsible for the successful clinical development and approval of therapeutics, including interleukin 2 for melanoma., Scharschmidt also played a central role in the early development of several new vaccines subsequently approved in the US and/or Europe, including the first influenza vaccine manufactured using mammalian cell culture rather than the traditional fertilized chicken eggs, the first adjuvanted flu vaccine, the meningococcal C vaccine used to help curb deadly outbreaks in Canada and the UK, a tetravalent meningococcal vaccine effective against A, C, Y & W strains, and the first vaccine against meningococcus B. In April 2008, Scharschmidt left Novartis to join Hyperion Therapeutics, a bay area biotech startup which was in early phase development of an ammonia lowering agent for patients with urea cycle disorders (UCDs). Within a month of his arrival, Hyperion was downsized. As a member of Hyperion's management team, he was closely involved in taking the company public in 2012 (HPTX, NASDAQ) orchestrated Hyperion's successful secondary stock offering in 2013, and completed the sale of the company to Horizon Pharma in May 2015. Scharschmidt currently serves as Board Member and/or consultant to several biotechnology companies in the US and abroad.  Editorships, awards and patents  Scharschmidt was elected to membership in the American Society for Clinical Investigation (ASCI) at age 36 and was subsequently elected ASCI President. He served from 1987-1992 as Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Clinical Investigation (JCI), the official publication of the ASCI. He was also elected to the Association of American Physicians. Scharschmidt served as Associate Editor of Gastroenterology (1981-1986), Associate Editor of the textbook Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease, (5th, 6th and 7th Editions) and as Editor of the Pocket Clinician textbook on Internal Medicine. He has received the Western Gastroenterological Association Research Award (1988), the University of Toronto Sheila Sherlock Research Award (1991), was 1998 Honoree of the American Liver Foundation Northern CA Division's Salute to Excellence, and was named 2010 Distinguished Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine Alumnus of the year. Scharschmidt is inventor or co-inventor on multiple US (Patent Nos. 5,308,833, 8,404,215, 8,642,012, 9,095,559, 13,610,580,) and international patients with multiple patents pending.  Publications  Scharschmidt has authored over 200 research and review articles. The clinical trials designed under Scharschmidt have resulted in over 20 publications. They address not only with the performance characteristics of RAVICTI, but also the use of blood and urine metabolites for drug dosing and the optimal timing and target levels for blood ammonia in patients with urea cycle disorders so as to minimize the risk and frequency of hyperammonemic crises,. Bruce's team at Hyperion also designed and executed a large randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial which demonstrated that lowering ammonia in patients with cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephalopathy (HE) decreases the risk and frequency of HE episodes. These findings, which were presented at the plenary session of American Association for the Study of Liver Disease, established that ammonia is not just a correlate, but a cause of HE and, as with UCDs, established the optimal timing and target levels for blood ammonia in cirrhotics so as to minimize their risk and frequency of HE episodes. He also helped define the natural history of HE as well as methodology for its diagnosis  Service and non-profit  As ASCI President, Scharschmidt initiated and obtained industry and NSF funding for a High School Science Teacher Summer Scholarship Program, which paired science teachers with ASCI mentors so as to enable them to teach science as the exciting discipline of discovery. Bruce has served on the National Board of Directors of the American Liver Foundation, on the External Advisory Board for the Clinical Translational Science Award at Northwestern/Feinberg School of Medicine, where he also served as President of the Medical Alumni Association Board from 2015 to 2017. He has chaired the Translational Team of the Gladstone Institutes, where he is also a member of the President's Council. He ran in the 2005 and 2006 Boston Marathons and participated in the 2008 Mt. Shasta Climb to raise funds for the American Liver Foundation, organized with his son in 2009 the ‚ÄúBiking For Burma‚Äôs Malnourished‚Äù bike ride from Central Thailand to the Burma Border to raise money for Global Health Access Program, and in 2010 co-founded the ‚ÄòCure the Cycle Challenge‚Äô for the National Urea Cycle Disorders Foundation in which he participated as a rider from 2010 through 2015.

She was the daughter of the surgeon William Leurs (ca 1753-1801) and Maria Anthonia Bergman (d. 1802). Leurs worked as a governess, and successfully managed her own girls school in Utrecht from 1833. In 1836, large amounts of false printed banknotes circulated in the Netherlands. The banknotes were traced to Leurs, who were trialed in 1837. She denied the accusation and claimed the notes were given to her by a bank clerk. She was charged with having manufactured the banknotes herself to distribute to uneducated people who would not observe her handwriting on them, and the prosecutor demanded death penalty on the grounds that she could have caused a financial crisis. Her defense attorney, however, claimed that the spelling errors on the false notes could not be expected from the hand of a school teacher, that she did not have time to manufacture them and that her school was successful and highly regarded and that she did not have an economic reason to engage in forgery. Hendrica Leurs was acquitted from charges, but she was unable to keep her school and emigrated to the Dutch East Indies, where she opened a school in Surakarta.

He was convicted for the December 10, 2003, murders of his mother and brother by gunman Chris Brashear and sentenced to death in March 2007. On February 22, 2018, 45 minutes before the scheduled execution at 6:00 pm, Whitaker had his death sentence commuted to life imprisonment without parole by Governor Greg Abbott, the first time Governor Abbott has done so. He currently resides in the McConnell Unit in Beeville, Texas, in solitary confinement.  Background  Whitaker had enlisted Chris Brashear to carry out the murders and Steven Champagne to be the getaway driver. Whitaker's father Kent was shot but survived. Whitaker fled to Mexico in the Summer of 2004 following a tip-off that he would shortly be arrested for the murders. He lived there for over a year under the false name of Rudy R√≠os. On September 15, 2005, a capital murder warrant was issued against Whitaker. Cooperating with US authorities, Mexican authorities arrested Whitaker without incident under immigration charges. In September 2005 Whitaker was handed over to US authorities at the border town of Laredo, Texas, where he was arrested for capital murder. The State of Texas executes by overdosing the condemned with pentobarbital from a compounding pharmacy and Whitaker's defense lawyers had claimed the state's first two executions of 2018 were botched because of old lethal injection drugs. Whitaker withdrew his appeal pending at the Supreme Court of the United States, pertaining to the purity of the drug used in Texas executions, just before the Governor granted clemency and commuted his sentence. In a rare decision on February 20, 2018, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles unanimously recommended that the death sentence be commuted to life imprisonment. The recommendation from the seven-member panel was sent to Republican Governor Greg Abbott. Abbott accepted their recommendation, and commuted Whitaker's death sentence, noting that Whitaker had \\"voluntarily and forever waived any and all claims to parole in exchange for a commutation of his sentence from death to life without the possibility of parole\\". Abbott cited the fact that Whitaker did not fire the gun and that his father Kent \\"insists that he would be victimized again if the state put to death his last remaining immediate family member\\", as the reasons for the commutation. Whitaker responded to the commutation of his sentence by saying, \\"I am thankful for this decision, not for me but for my dad\\". In 2012, Whitaker had previously stated his strong opposition to the idea of life without the possibility for parole, and wrote in his blog from prison: Early life Whitaker attended Clements High School, but had to leave as a result of burglaries he had committed with other students. As a result, he was evaluated by a psychologist who stated that he was \\"experiencing the clinical symptoms of a delusional (paranoid) disorder\\". Whitaker had previously recruited others in a plot to murder his family in 2001 which ended up being aborted. At the trial, one of the recruits from 2001 said that he had contacted the Sugar Land Police Department with information about the previous plot when he heard about the murders in 2003. This individual was given immunity from prosecution in exchange for testifying for the prosecution against Whitaker. A 2009 psychological evaluation of Whitaker noted that after high school he was given, \\"More of the unearned trappings of wealth\\" while his thoughts became even more disorganized. Whitaker's affluent parents had bought him several luxury vehicles and paid for his tuition at Baylor University and Sam Houston State University. They also bought him a lakeside townhouse in Willis, Texas, and a $4,000 Rolex watch was given to him as a graduation present hours before the murders, despite the fact that he was not enrolled at college at the time. Whitaker also had access to an $80,000 trust fund from his grandparents, although he testified in court that he did not know he could access it. He had dropped out of university but did not notify his parents. Murders On December 10, 2003, Whitaker falsely told his family that he had just taken his final exams and would soon be graduating from Sam Houston State University. They drove to the nearby Pappadeaux restaurant in Stafford for a celebratory dinner. Meanwhile Chris Brashear, dressed in black, including a ski mask, had entered the Whitaker family home, taken Kevin's gun and ammunition from a locked box in his room, staged a burglary, and then waited near the front door for the Whitaker family to return home. Upon returning home, but before entering the house, Thomas said that he needed to collect his cell phone from his parked Yukon, knowing that Brashear was armed and waiting inside to kill his family. Thomas' brother Kevin entered the family home first and reportedly smiled when he saw the masked Brashear. Brashear shot Kevin once through his chest and he fell to the floor. Patricia was also shot in the chest and fell to the floor. Kent rushed in and was shot in the shoulder with the bullet shattering his humerus. Thomas then ran inside and staged a struggle with Brashear, getting shot in his left arm to divert suspicion. Brashear then exited through the Whitakers' back door and jumped the fence into the rear neighbour's yard. Kevin died within minutes of being shot. Patricia died shortly after being airlifted by Life Flight service on the way to Memorial Hermann Hospital. Thomas told First Responders that he thought the gunman was black, in order to divert suspicion away from Brashear. Kent survived the murder attempt. Conviction At his trial in March 2007, prosecutors alleged that although it wasn't Whitaker who shot his family members, he was responsible for the murders because he played the leading part in the conspiracy to commit murder. Whitaker was refused a plea bargain by the District Attorney in return for his admission of guilt and was tried for capital murder. The prosecution claimed that Whitaker had wanted his family dead so he could capitalize on a million-dollar life insurance payout. Whitaker denies this and says that the only life insurance policy the family had was for $50,000 on his father's life. Whitaker claims that a mental disorder, exacerbated by drug abuse, caused him to want his family eliminated. Kent Whitaker had already forgiven his son for his part in the murders and had tried to persuade the jury not to deliver a death sentence. However, the jury decided to convict Whitaker of capital murder under the Texas law of parties. Chris Brashear received a life sentence in a plea bargain worked out with prosecutors and Steven Champagne received 15 years in return for being the main witness for the prosecution. Appeals Whitaker appealed his death sentence on the grounds of the ineffectiveness of his trial counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, the arbitrariness of the death penalty punishment and the cruelty of the lethal injection, in violation of the eighth amendment to the U.S. constitution prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment. In April 2017, his appeal against prosecutorial misconduct was dismissed by the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. On October 10, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to consider an appeal based on his claims that his trial lawyer was deficient and that Fort Bend County prosecutors engaged in misconduct by improperly referring to discussion of a plea deal that never was reached. The justices provided no explanation for their refusal. On November 1, 2017, his death warrant was signed, scheduling his execution for February 22, 2018. Whitaker stated that his father, Kent, would have been revictimized by his execution. Kent Whitaker, the only surviving victim of the crime, wrote a book about the murders titled Murder by Family detailing his forgiveness for his son's actions. Kent also wrote to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles asking for clemency for his son, and the Chairman of the Board met with him for half an hour. The Board unanimously recommended clemency to Governor Greg Abbott. Thomas Whitaker and other inmates initiated an unsuccessful class action suit against the conditions on Texas death row where inmates are kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day. Writing He has contributed to Solitary Watch where he wrote about the effects of solitary confinement on himself and other death row inmates. He also contributed to Hell Is a Very Small Place: Voices from Solitary Confinement. He won prizes in PEN America's prison writing contests for \\"Hell's Kitchen\\", \\"Manufacturing Anomie\\" and the essay \\"A Nothing Would Do as Well\\". He was named a PEN America Writing for Justice Fellow in 2018 for writing about incarceration and criminal justice in the United States. In 2007, he founded an inmate blog, entitled Minutes Before Six which publishes articles, poetry and art from inmates held in prisons in the United States, maintained by volunteers. Texas inmates are typically executed at 6:00p.m. in the Huntsville Unit. Whitaker received a Bachelor of Arts in English and Sociology from Adams State University, and a Master of Arts degree in English from California State University, Dominguez Hills while on death row.

Freeman were the first to formulate an explicit organizational theory about population ecology with the 1977 article in the American Journal of Sociology, which was the seminal work in the field of organizational ecology. This article proposed: :... [a] population ecology perspective on organization-environment relations... as an alternative to the dominant adaptation perspective. The strength of inertial pressures on organizational structure suggests the application of models that depend on competition and selection in populations of organizations. Several such models, as well as issues arising in attempts to apply them to the organization-environment problem, are discussed.Hannan & Freeman (1977, 929) The scope of their organizational ecology theory ranged from birth of new organizations (organizational founding), organizational growth and organizational change, to the death of organizations (firm mortality). Organizations compete in their environment, where processes like natural selection rule.  Selected publications  * Hannan, Michael T., and Glenn R. Carroll.

Life He unofficially became the vizier of Seljuk Empire after the death of Malik-Shah. Taj al-Mulk was from an old noble family of Fars region. Not much is known about his life before his post in Seljuq government, but his biographers praised him for his competence, knowledge and fluency, which shows he had enough education. He was at first, in service of Imad al-Dowla Sawtekin, a local Seljuq amir. Impressed by Taj al-Mulk's competency, the amir introduced him to the Seljuq Sultan and he entered the court. Vizier Judging by the primary sources, it seems that he intended to become the vizier from the beginning. After gaining the support of Terkan Khatun, he built a tomb for Shaykh Abu Ishaq-i Shirazi, and a school in Baghdad (known as Madrasa-i Tajiya) in order to gain some support from the masses. He slowly and carefully started his opposition to Nizam al-Mulk. Helped by some other courtiers, his goal was to depose Nizam al-Mulk, though Nizam al-Mulk didn't take them seriously, and the Sultan himself wasn't able to depose Nizam al-Mulk. He finally gained a chance to increase the disagreements between Nizam al-Mulk and the Sultan. Although both Nizam al- Mulk and the Sultan were in agreement about the future Sultan, Barkiyaruq, Taj al-Mulk supported Mahmoud, the child of Terkan Khatun. Isma'ili Some primary sources such as Abd al-Jalil Qazvini Razi claimed that he was an Isma'ili and mentioned an story about his pact with Hassan-i Sabbah, which explain his enmity toward Nizam al-Mulk. Beside that, Nizam al-Mulk warned Sultan about \\"those who hide their true goals and intend to depose the vizier and the Abbasid Caliph\\" in his work, Siyasatnama. He was responsible to deliver Sultan Malik-Shah's harsh letter to Nizam al-Mulk, which Nizam al-Mulk answered with harsh words as well. Malik-Shah, angry of Nizam al-Mulk's harsh words, and was preparing himself for a travel to Baghdad. When they reached Nahavand, Nizam al-Mulk was assassinated by an Isma'ili agent. Primary sources explicitly mentioned that the assassination of Nizam al-Mulk was orchestrated by Taj al-Mulk, making it likely that Malik-Shah was aware of it. The deposition of Nizam al-Mulk was a win for both Tarkan Khatun and her supporters, as well as the Isma'ilis who enjoyed the support of Taj al-Mulk. When the Sultan reached Baghdad, Taj al-Mulk prohibited the soldiers from entering the houses of Baghdad's population and looting the city. He also bought ten days for al-Muqtadi, who had to leave the city at the order of Malik-Shah. But the subsequent events weren't in favor of Taj al-Mulk. Malik- Shah suddenly died only a mouth and a few days after the death of Nizam al- Mulk. In the following civil war between Barkiyaruq (the official heir) and Malik-Ismail (supported by Tarkan Khatun), the latter was defeated in a battle near Boroujerd. Taj al-Mulk was arrested, and Barkiyaruq (who was aware of his competency) at first decided to grant him the post of viziership, but he was assassinated by the supporters of Nizam al-Mulk who considered him responsible for the death of Nizam al-Mulk. Of Persian descent, he was unoffially the vizier of Seljuk Empire for not more than 7 months.

Since 1992, the foundation has been recognized as a \\"public utility\\" (French: D√©claration d'utilit√© publique).  History  Bardot's initial involvement with animal rights was in 1962, after seeing photographs of the conditions in which animals were killed. Upon this, Bardot immediately began advocating against the use of painful electric shock pistols in slaughterhouses,Initiales B.B., √©ditions Grasset. and became a vegetarian. In 1967, Bardot was received at the √âlys√©e Palace where she met with Charles de Gaulle, the then president of France. It was a few years later that Bardot obtained the \\"stunning before slaughter\\" rights from the government. In 1977, Bardot went on to campaign against the hunting of baby Harp seals. Upon invitation from Paul Watson, of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, Bardot embarked on a five day trip to the ice fields in Blanc-Sablon, Canada, receiving significant media attention. In addition, the trip also gained Bardot the support of French president, Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, leading to changes regarding the import of seal products. The Brigitte Bardot Foundation (La Fondation Brigitte Bardot) was launched by Bardot in Saint-Tropez, in 1986 where she auctioned her jewellery and other personal possessions to raise 3 million French francs for her campaigns and activities. In 1988, the organization moved to Paris. It was here that Bardot led a television series entitled S.O.S. Animaux. The show aired from 1989 through 1992, over which time it spread its purpose of influencing public opinion of animal cruelty. In 1991, Bardot donated her Saint Tropez property, La Madrague to the foundation so as to raise the capital required to obtain a declaration of public utility. The declaration was granted on February 21, 1992, by the Conseil d'√âtat. In 1995, the Dalai Lama became an honorary member of the foundation. The Foundation celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2006. It reached 75,000 members by the year 2014.  Activities  The foundation has helped create shelters for elephants in South Africa, koalas in Australia, dancing bears in Bulgaria, and primates in Cameroon. It has also reintroduced several animal species that had completely disappeared in Senegal and participated in the reintroduction of wolves to the Alps. A mobile veterinary clinic has also been created for the Eastern Bloc countries. The foundation is a regular plaintiff in lawsuits against animal cruelty. In January 2016, to support the proposition of a law to ban force-feeding on ducks and geese, the foundation invited Pamela Anderson to speak at the French National Assembly. While funding other French animal shelters, the foundation has also created its own shelter, La Mare Anzou, located in a ruined mansion in the department of Eure in Normandy. It covers several hectares, where 200 dogs and 250 cats wait for adoption. This shelter is also a \\"retirement home\\" for several horses, cows, etc. After complaints from local residents about noise nuisance threatened to close the shelter in 2009, the foundation began soundproofing construction, investing 3 million euros to date. Brigitte Bardot and Christophe Marie in 2006.On 23 December 2006, Brigitte Bardot published a letter to Nicolas Sarkozy in the Foundation's newsletter, L'info-journal (published every trimester since 1992), condemning the practice of the Eid al-Adha in France. This caused her be charged with and later fined for incitement to racial hatred. In 2009, the foundation launched a campaign against hippophagy titled Le cheval vous l'aimez comment? ( \\"The horse, how do you like it?\\"). The foundation was banned from the Salon du Cheval (Paris Horse Show), the organizers of the event stating, \\"This is not a place to develop a view point on hippophagy\\". In the winter of this year, the foundation launched Fourrure : signe ext√©rieur de cruaut√© (\\"Fur : external sign of cruelty\\"), a national campaign of posters and television spots against fur. The French fur association attempted to ban these advertisements, without success. In December 2005, a new communication campaign Fourrure, le look qui tue (\\"Fur, the look that kills\\") was launched in France. The foundation has also supported the yearly \\"day without fur,\\" on every first Saturday of winter sales since 2007. In 2011, the boat \\"MV Brigitte Bardot,\\" co-financed by the foundation and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society of Paul Watson, was damaged by a wave.

She is known for her large paintings incorporating neon lighting tubes. Her work is featured in museums and galleries including the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Brooklyn Museum, Museum of Modern Art, and the High Museum of Art. Weatherford's solo exhibitions include Mary Weatherford: From the Mountain to the Sea at Claremont McKenna College, I've Seen Gray Whales Go By at Gagosian West, and Like The Land Loves the Sea at David Kordansky Gallery, Los Angeles. Her work has been part of group exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art and the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University. Life and career Weatherford was born in Ojai, California and raised in Los Angeles. She studied visual arts and art history at Princeton University, graduating in 1984. After graduation, she lived and worked in New York where in 1985 she was a Helena Rubinstein Fellow in the Independent Study Program of the Whitney Museum of American Art. She returned to Southern California in 1999 and later received an M.F.A. from the Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts at Bard College. Early in her career she also collaborated with her late sister, the writer Margaret Weatherford, on performance art and worked as a bookkeeper for the artist Mike Kelley. A career breakthrough came in 2012 with Weatherford's Bakersfield Project exhibition at the Todd Madigan Gallery at California State University at Bakersfield where she was an artist in residence. The Bakersfield paintings marked the first time she incorporated illuminated neon light tubes into her abstract paintings. The series was inspired by the colourful neon signs she saw on old restaurant and factory buildings while driving around Bakersfield. Weatherford used neon in the Bakersfield Project and later series of paintings, such as Manhattan (2013), Los Angeles (2014) and Train Yard (2016‚Äì2020) to recreate the sensations of specific places or moments. In an interview for Gagosian Quarterly she once said, ‚ÄòI try to depict or deliver not only a visual translation of a place in time, but with that, the scent, the sound, and the feeling. Is it chilly? Is it hot? Is there a clanging sound?‚Äô Her work was included in the exhibitions Variations: Conversations in and Around Abstract Painting at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and The Forever Now: Contemporary Painting in an Atemporal World at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2014. That same year she received the $25,000 Artist Award from the Artists' Legacy Foundation founded by Viola Frey. Examples of Weatherford's abstract paintings incorporating neon lights are held by the Museum of Modern Art, the Hirshhorn Museum, and the Hammer Museum. Another of her neon paintings, Past Sunset (2015), was shown at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in the 2016 exhibition NO MAN'S LAND: Women Artists from the Rubell Family Collection. Three examples of her early work combining acrylic, ink and screen print are held by the Brooklyn Museum: Madame Butterfly (1989), Violetta (1991), and First Riddle (1991).

Description  A Game of Tric-Trac offers an insight into seventeenth century Dutch nightlife as well as the codes surrounding prostitution and morality. Backgammon, which was commonly called tric-trac, was a popular pastime during Leyster's lifetime, depicted in paintings by many of her contemporaries. While there is often a woman present in these pieces, besides one print by Jacob Matham, none of them depict her as having an active role in the game. Leyster's painting is interesting then because the woman in it appears to the opposing player. Leyster signals this to the viewer with her placement of the oil lamp, which would have been placed on one side of the board (the \\"inner table\\") between the two players.  Role of Prostitution  Compared to other paintings and prints of her time, such as A Game of Tric-Trac in an Inn by Remigius Hogenberg, Leyster's identification of the woman in her painting as a prostitute is not as obvious. While she holds a glass of wine (a symbol which may have codified her profession) her clothing is more modest and domestic. It is, however, the lit pipe which she hands to her opposer which gives away her occupation. During Leyster's life time pijpen or \\"to pipe/to smoke a pipe\\" would have had explicit sexual connotations. A similar idea is found in Jacob Cats' Spiegel van den Ouwden en Niewen in the section \\"Whores and their sly tricks\\" which depicts a prostitute handing her client a brazier of hot coals instead of a pipe. However both Leyster's painting and the emblem in Cats' book can be read through its accompanying verse \\"Thus I am in danger where I put my fingers; your coal as does your maidenhead - it burns or it infects\\" condemning both the courtesan and her male client. Some critics, such as Cynthia Kartnehorst-Von Borgendorf Rupprath argue that Leyster's work drives this point home as the man in the painting breaks the fourth wall looking at the viewer as if asking his or her involvement in his decision.  Style  Leyster's choice to have this exchange take place at night with candlelight both adds an air of suspense and intrigue and showcases her mastery of and interest in lighting and shadows. While some scholars have argued that this emphasis on lighting brings to mind Leyster's potential influence from the Utrecht Caravaggisti others emphasize the painting's similarity in composition to her husband, Jan Miense Molenaer's early work Card Players by Lamplight. While both paintings employ similar lighting and idleness, the most convincing similarity is the mirrored image of Leyster's cavalier to the figure in Molenaer's foreground.

Background  Dou Zhengu was born in 892, during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang. He was from Baishui (ÁôΩÊ∞¥, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi). His father Dou Zhuan () would subsequently serve as a consultant in the imperial government of Later Tang. Dou Zhengu himself was said to be capable in writing even in his youth.History of Song, vol. 262.  During Later Tang  Dou Zhengu passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class during the Tongguang era (923-926) of Later Tang's founding emperor Li Cunxu, and he was made the secretary general for Wanquan County (Ëê¨ÂÖ®, in modern Zhangjiakou, Hebei). He later left governmental service to observe a mourning period after his mother's death. After the mourning period was over, he was made an assistant to Shi Jingtang the military governor (Jiedushi) of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi).Shi Jingtang was made the military governor of Hedong by Li Cunxu's successor and adoptive brother Li Siyuan, who was Shi's father-in-law, in 932; therefore, Dou's commission as Shi's assistant must have come after that point. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. Shi considered Dou to be an honest official, and thus viewed him highly.  During Later Jin  = During Shi Jingtang's reign = In 936, Shi Jingtang, with aid from the Khitan Empire, rebelled against then-Later Tang emperor Li Congke (Li Siyuan's adoptive son and Shi's brother-in-law) and established Later Jin. In his nascent government, he made Dou Zhengu an imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Xueshi),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. as well as Hubu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®, Hubu). He then gave Dou the greater title of Zhongshu Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). Not long after, with Khitan help, Shi destroyed Later Tang and took over its territory. In 938, Shi encouraged his officials to submit secret proposals to improve his governance. Dou submitted a petition in which he suggested that the imperial officials be required to submit recommendations for people to be commissioned, pointing out that at that time, the Later Jin government lacked capable officials and thus such recommendations were necessary for good governance. He further suggested that the promotions and demotions of recommending officials be tied to the performance of those that they recommended. Shi was very pleased with his proposal and made it law. In 939, Shi made Dou the deputy chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤‰∏≠‰∏û, Yushi Zhongcheng), and ordered him, along with the minister of ceremony Cui Zhuo (), the deputy minister of justice L√º Qi (), and the deputy minister of rites Zhang Yuntong (), to draft regulations for imperial gatherings, as well as music and dance appropriate for such ceremonies. Later in Shi's reign, Dou served successively as the deputy minister of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Xingbu Shilang) and then Menxia Shilang (), the deputy head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng). During his service under Shi, he had friendly relations with the major general Liu Zhiyuan. = During Shi Chonggui's reign = During the subsequent reign of Shi Jingtang's adoptive son (biological nephew) Shi Chonggui, Dou initially served as the minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Gongbu Shangshu), and then the minister of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu). He was put in charge of the imperial examinations. In the Tang days, the imperial examinations were held not only at day, but also at night (for the duration that it would take to burn through three candles), but in 931 (during Li Siyuan's reign), that custom was changed such that the examinations would only happen during the day. Dou considered the daylight period to be insufficient for the testing, and requested that nighttime examinations be restored. He was also praised for being fair in his administration of the examinations. He was later made the minister of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Xingbu Shangshu), before being sent out of the imperial government to serve as the military prefect (ÂúòÁ∑¥‰Ωø, Tuanlianshi) of Ying Prefecture (ÊΩÅÂ∑û, in modern Fuyang, Anhui), where he remained for a year, before being recalled to the imperial government to again serve as minister of justice.  During Later Han  = During Liu Zhiyuan's reign = Around the new year 947, Later Jin was destroyed by Khitan (then known as Liao)'s Emperor Taizong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. Emperor Taizong entered Later Jin's capital Daliang and initially declared himself emperor of China as well. (Dou Zhengu's activities during this period were not clearly stated in traditional histories, although he presumably, along with other Later Jin officials, submitted to the Liao emperor.) Liu Zhiyuan, then the military governor of Hedong, initially postured that he would submit to Liao, but then declared himself emperor (of a new state later known as Later Han). With Liu and many others resisting his rule, Emperor Taizong withdrew from the Central Plains region and died on the way back to Liao proper.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. In the power vacuum, Liu first entered Luoyang, and then headed for Daliang. Dou, along with the other Later Jin officials remaining at Daliang, went to Xingyang (ÊªéÈôΩ, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan) to welcome him to Daliang, which he subsequently entered.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287. Not long after, Liu requested discussions on how he should establish the imperial temples, in light of the fact that he had claimed ancestry from the Han dynasty imperial clan and honored Emperor Guangwu of Han as a distant ancestor. Dou proposed that it would be appropriate to establish six temples, with Emperor Gao of Han and Emperor Guangwu serving as the two most honored ancestors, and Liu's own four generations of ancestors in the other four temples. Liu followed his proposal, and thereafter made him the minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu, note not the same as minister of rites). Later in the year, finding that having two chancellors (Su Fengji and Su Yugui) was not sufficient, he resolved to commission at least one more chancellor. Su Fengji recommended Li Tao, but as Liu respected Dou, he decided to make both Li and Dou chancellors with the title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), with Dou receiving the additional titles of Menxia Shilang, Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫, one of the Three Excellencies), and grand imperial scholar at Hongwen Pavilion. In early 948, Liu Zhiyuan fell deathly ill. He entrusted his son Liu Chengyou to Su Fengji, Yang Bin, Shi Hongzhao, and Guo Wei, and then died. Liu Chengyou thereafter took the throne. = During Liu Chengyou's reign = During Liu Chengyou's administration, there was a split of authorities among the high level officials. Yang Bin oversaw the governmental operations; Guo Wei oversaw military operations; Shi Hongzhao oversaw the imperial guards; and Wang Zhang oversaw the financial agencies. Su Fengji, Su Yugui, and Dou Zhengu served as chancellors.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 289. It was said, however, that Dou was only able to be elegant and upright in his behavior, and was unable to curb the power-grabbing of Yang, Shi, and Wang. In 949, after Guo defeated the rebellion of the major general Li Shouzhen, Guo declined to be individually rewarded, so the other high-level officials and regional governors were all rewarded. As part of the rewards, Dou was given the title of Situ (Âè∏Âæí, also one of the Three Excellencies).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 288. In summer 950, an incident occurred to damage the relationship between the leading officials. They had discussed and resolved that, because of frequent Liao incursions and the inability for the circuits to coordinate their defenses, Guo Wei should be sent to Yedu (ÈÑ¥ÈÉΩ, in modern Handan, Hebei) to serve as its defender (as well as the military governor of Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered at Yedu) to coordinate the defense against Liao. Shi advocated that Guo be allowed to continue to retain his title as chief of staff to allow him to give orders to the military governors. Su Fengji opposed, pointing out that there had been no precedent to allow a military governor to continue to retain chief of staff title. Eventually, Liu Chengyou approved Shi's proposal. When Shi then complained to Su about his opposition, Su responded, \\"Letting the central government control the outlying circuits is proper. How can it be that now you are letting an outlying circuit control the central government?\\" It was at the send-off dinner for Guo the next day, at Dou's mansion, that frictions within the imperial government came to the forefront. At the feast, Shi, when toasting Guo, spoke in a harsh voice, \\"How could there have been opposition when we discussed this matter yesterday at the imperial gathering? Now, let us drink, younger brother [(i.e., Guo)]!\\" Su and Yang also raised their cups and stated, \\"This is an important matter for the state. Do not bear grudges!\\" Shi responded, again in a harsh voice, \\"To settle the state, it takes long spears and large swords. What use does the ink brush have?\\" Wang Zhang, the director of the financial agencies, responded, \\"Without ink brushes, where does money come from?\\" It was said that from this point on, there were increasing tension between generals and chancellors. By winter 950, Liu Chengyou himself had tired of the control the senior officials had on his government, even though, under Yang's leadership, the imperial government was considered well-run. He conspired with his uncle Li Ye (), as well as his favorite attendants Nie Wenjin (), Hou Kuangzan (), and Guo Yunming (), to kill Yang and the others. Soon thereafter, they surprised and killed Yang, Shi, and Wang. Guo Wei's and Wang Jun's families were slaughtered, leading to Guo's rising at Yedu, taking his army south, and heading toward Daliang. Hearing that Guo was approaching, Liu Chengyou, in fear, commented to Dou, \\"Maybe I was being too frivolous.\\" Despite this realization, he did not accept his mother Empress Dowager Li's advice to try to maintain a pretense of emperor-subject relations with Guo Wei; rather, commissioning Liu Zhiyuan's half-brother Murong Yanchao as the commander of the imperial troops, he decided to confront Guo Wei personally. He took the three chancellors (Su Fengji, Su Yugui, and Dou) with him. Around the new year 951, Guo's army and the imperial army confronted each other, and the imperial troops were defeated; most of the generals surrendered to Guo Wei. Thereafter, Liu Chengyou was killed in the confusion, and Su Fengji committed suicide. Su Yugui and Dou hid themselves, but after Guo entered Daliang, he located them and restored them to their chancellor positions. Guo initially postured that he would support Liu Zhiyuan's adoptive son (biological nephew) Liu Yun the military governor of Wuning Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂØß, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) to succeed to the Later Han throne. However, before Liu Yun would arrive at Daliang, with news that came that there was a Liao incursion, Guo headed north, ostensibly to defend against it, while leaving the matters of state at Daliang to Dou, Su Yugui, and Wang Jun, and military matters to Wang Yin (). Shortly after Guo left Daliang, his soldiers rose and supported him as emperor. He thereafter returned to Daliang and claimed the throne, establishing Later Zhou. (He put Liu Yun under house arrest, and thereafter had Liu Yun killed.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 290.)  During Later Zhou  Shortly after Guo Wei took the throne, he bestowed on Dou Zhengu the greater chancellor title of Shizhong (). Not long after, with the senior statesman Feng Dao becoming a chancellor again, Dou was put in charge of editing imperial histories. Not long after, he was removed from his chancellor position, carrying only now his title as Situ, and was created the Duke of Yi. In 954, by which time Guo Wei had died and been succeeded by his adoptive son Guo Rong, the chancellor Fan Zhi was given the title of Situ. As a result, Dou was effectively forced into retirement, and took up residence at Luoyang. The local government considered his household to be a regular household and did not exempt it from either taxes or conscripted labor. Dou went to see the defender of Luoyang, Xiang Xun (), to request to be exempted, but Xiang did not listen to him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 292.  During Song  After the Later Zhou throne was seized by the general Zhao Kuangyin, who established Song dynasty as its Emperor Taizu, Dou Zhengu was summoned back to the imperial court given his prior status as one of the Three Excellencies. He went to see Fan Zhi, who had remained a chancellor under the new Song emperor, requesting that he be given an honorary post as an advisor to the Crown Prince so that he could attend imperial meetings. Fan paid his request no heed and did not report it to the emperor. He thus returned to Luoyang. There, he spent his days visiting the mountains and the rivers, in the company of commoners and prostitutes, drinking and enjoying their company. In 969, he became ill, and he authored his own tombstone text before dying.

Location Island Wedge Tomb is located 9.3 km (5.8 mi) southeast of Mallow. History Wedge tombs of this kind were built in Ireland in the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age, c. 2500‚Äì2000 BC. Carbon-14 dating indicated activity in the time range of 1412‚Äì1308 BC and suggested that the gallery and outer wall were constructed in Early Bronze Age, with later enhancements. Evidence of cremated burial was found in several areas of the main chamber, as well as worked flint and scrapers. Also found were a spindle whorl and two glass beads. Three lots of cremated bone were found in the chamber but two were too small for meaningful interpretation. The third, in a pit towards the rear, was probably a 60-70-year-old female. The tomb was excavated and partially restored in 1957. Some cremated bones were found during the excavation, located towards the end of the gallery. Description The gallery of this tomb is oriented SW‚ÄìNE. It is divided into a portico and main chamber enclosed in a U-shaped outer wall surrounded by an oval cairn measuring long by wide.

She is known as the victim of a famous case of kidnapping and rape in the Netherlands in 1515. The case was widely famed in the contemporary Netherlands, where it was published and popular within literature: it was also the subject of a song, where Catharina de Grebber was described as a rabbit persecuted by a hunter. Catharina de Grebber was the daughter of the wealthy shipper Pieter Claeszoon Grebber and Alyt van Tetrode in Leiden. In 1509, at the age of thirteen, she was abducted by the nobleman Gerrit van Raaphorst and four accomplices on her way to church with her father in Wassenaar. Raaphorst took her to Sassenheim, where he married her. During this period, she was reportedly raped and locked up. Four months later, she returned to her parents. When Raaphorst wished to have her returned, her parents sued him for forcing her to marry him. Raaphorst claimed that both the marriage and intercourse were voluntary. The court case continued for years, until 1515, when Raaphorst was judged guilty for rape and sentenced to a public walk of repentance and to pay for a painted window in the church. Raaphorst was executed for the murder of a man in 1524. The life of Catharina de Grebber after 1515 is not known.

Active in Germany and the United States between the years 1921 and 1977, she was regarded for her work on psychosomatic medicine, women's psychosexual development, sexual dysfunction, and family relationships. She was a faculty and staff member of the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis from 1936 to 1969. Early life and education Therese Friedmann was born in Eger, Hungary, to a traditional Jewish family. Her parents were Ignatius Friedmann and Charlotte Link Friedmann, and she had one brother and two sisters. When she was six years old, her family moved to Budapest. She was the only one of her siblings to receive a university education, graduating from the University of Budapest with a doctorate in medicine in 1916. She was a participant of the Galileo Circle.Judit Meszaros, 'Ferenczi and Beyond. Exile of the Budapest School and Solidarity in the Psychoanalytic Movement During the Nazi Years', Routledge, 2014, p.68. Career Benedek initially decided to pursue a career in child psychology and study the effects of maternal separation on infant emotions. She completed the requirements for a residency in pediatrics in 1918 and began working as an assistant physician at the St. Elizabeth University pediatric clinic in Bratislava. She left this position in 1919 and married shortly afterward. Having taken courses from Hungarian psychoanalyst S√°ndor Ferenczi, an associate of Sigmund Freud, during her university days, she decided to switch her career track to psychoanalysis. She underwent a five-month training analysis with Ferenczi before leaving Budapest. In 1920 she and her new husband relocated to Germany to escape the political upheaval in Hungary. In 1920 she became an assistant physician at the Neurological-Psychiatric Clinic of the University of Leipzig and in 1921 opened the city's first private psychoanalytic practice, becoming a training analyst. From 1933 to 1935 she was a training and supervisory analyst at the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute. Although as a Jew she was a target of the Nazi Party in Germany in the mid-1930s, Benedek did not feel the need to emigrate, since she considered herself a Hungarian rather than a Jew. Nevertheless, in 1936 her husband convinced her to leave Germany and accept the offer of Franz Alexander to work as a training analyst for the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis. She was a faculty and staff member, engaging in teaching, supervising, and research at the institute, for the next 34 years. She acquired her U.S. medical license in 1937 and her U.S. citizenship in 1943. Her husband joined the faculty of Northwestern University School of Medicine. Research Benedek is said to have \\"played a central role in the development of psychoanalysis in the United States\\". Influenced by the theories of hysteria promulgated by Freud, her early research had sought a link between psychological and endocrinal factors for such problems as anxiety, aggression, and diabetes. In the United States, working with endocrinologist Boris B. Rubinstein, she conducted extensive studies on the correlation between ovulation and female emotions, resulting in the 1942 book The Sexual Cycle in Women. Benedek explored a link between the estrogen/progesterone cycle and a woman's desire to engage in sexual intercourse, nurture a pregnancy, and raise children. She also described the \\"modern\\" woman's struggle with her natural maternal role. Benedek's analysis of the \\"un-motherly modern mother\\" was widely praised and included in psychology and medical teaching manuals. Benedek also studied the effects of gender equality and democracy on relationships between spouses and their children. Her 1949 paper Parenthood as a Developmental Phase: A contribution to the libido theory rejected the prevailing theory that psychological development stopped after adolescence; Benedek maintained that it continued throughout parenthood. She published further research on parenthood, family relationships, and depression into her seventies, and continued seeing patients in private practice after her retirement from the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis in 1969. Affiliations In Germany Benedek was a member of the Berlin Psychoanalytic Society. In the United States she belonged to national and international psychoanalytic organizations and served as president of the Chicago Psychoanalytic Society from 1958 to 1959. On her eightieth birthday in 1972, the Therese Benedek Research Foundation was established in her honor. Personal life In 1919 she married Tibor Benedek, a dermatologist and researcher. She and her husband, a Hungarian Protestant, attended church together regularly. They had one son and one daughter. She died of a heart attack on October 27, 1977, aged 84. Her husband predeceased her by three years. Her papers are stored at the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis. Bibliography =Books= (with Boris Benjamin Rubenstein) (with Joan Fleming) * (with E.

NGC 1140 is a starburst galaxy, meaning it is forming stars at a very fast rate. In fact, while it is only a tenth as wide as the Milky Way, it is producing stars at a rate of /yr, about the same as the Milky Way. The image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope shows bright blue and red regions of star formation, similar to NGC 1569. The starburst is estimated to have begun about 5 million years ago. Its low metallicity (the ratio of hydrogen and helium to other elements) makes NGC 1140 similar to primordial galaxies. Wolf‚ÄìRayet stars, a class of blue, massive, and luminous stars, are present in this galaxy; in fact, NGC 1140 has so many of them that their spectra also appear in the galaxy's spectrum.

Ramos writes about the ways La Chica Boom appropriates and plays with the stereotypes of Mexicans as unsanitary, obnoxiously flavorful, and over sexualized, in order to dismantle them.

In addition to the dismissal of Walter Lohmann on 19 January 1928 and the dismissal of the Chief of the Reichsmarine Hans Zenker, on 30 September 1928, it also led to the resignation of the Reichswehr Minister Otto Gessler. Secret Rearmament In early 1923 Captain Walter Lohmann, who had acquired experience in international business, gained command of the Maritime Transport Department of the Navy in October 1920, and whose primary responsibility was logistical matters. With the full confidence and trust of naval chief Admiral Paul Behncke, he was transferred to managing the black funds of the Navy that were generally used for covert funding. It was, initially, proceeds of approximately 100 million gold marks from the illegal sale of ships and submarines scrapped in 1919 and 1920, which actually would have to be scrapped, under requirements of the Treaty of Versailles. In addition Ruhr Funds submitted by the Cabinet without the knowledge of the Parliament, were added to the fund, of which a portion for the marine of 12 million German gold marks, were to be used to prepare for military resistance in the Occupation of the Ruhr crisis. Defense Minister Otto Gessler wrote in his memoirs: The funds for the Ruhr fund were mainly used for the secret sale of weapons, especially in Italy, and for the construction of a tanker fleet. But the activities went far beyond that: * Establishment of a marine intelligence service (), initially to ensure the supply of raw materials. * Development of a modern submarine (among other things with a bubble-free torpedo, see also German Type II submarine) with the help of secret funds of the Friedrich Krupp Ship Yard in Kiel, the AG Weser in Bremen, and Vulcan Shipyard () in Hamburg and Stettin (now Szczecin) and by the Engineers Office for Shipbuilding () in The Hague, Netherlands, which was built on the basis of the mediation of Wilhelm Canaris from 1926 in C√°diz, Spain. * Support for the companies Heinkel, Dornier Flugzeugwerke and Rohrbach Metall-Flugzeugbau in the construction of aeroplanes. * Purchase of the Caspar works, which developed \\"civilian\\" aircraft, whose performance data \\"coincidentally\\" resemble those of military aircraft of other countries. * Severa (seaplane pilot division) to develop aircraft types required by the Navy and to train pilots on Norderney and Kiel- Holtenau. * Travem√ºnde Marina A.G. to the development and maintenance of speedboats.Francis L. Carsten: Reichswehr and Politics, 1918-1933, Cologne 1964, p. 314 * Participation in the founding of Neust√§dter Slip GmbH as a repair and training company for sport boats and speed boats. * Establishment of the German German High Seasport Association HANSA to promote the offspring of officers for the secret reconstruction of the Reichsmarine. * The yachting school in Neustadt in Holstein, which was well equipped with boats, was made available to the German High Seasport Association HANSA (today DHH). Economic Activities In addition, Lohmann began investing in commercial projects: * Property speculation * Purchase of the Berlin Bacon AG, with which he wanted to dispute the British Speck market to the Danes * Purchase of a private bank shares bank Berliner Bankverein (the bank through which Lohmann financed all activities) * Development of an ice rescue process * Participation in and guarantees for Phoebus-Film AG, (see below) There were various explanations for these non-maritime activities: * They should be indirectly in the interests of the navy, e.g. Berlin Bacon AG's refrigerated vessels could also have been used as troop carriers during the war * They should serve the unobtrusive construction of an agent network * They should conceal the financing of the secret projects * They should replace the lack of funds inflow through economic successOtto Gessler: Reichswehrpolitik in the Weimar period. P. 448 Lohmann, on the other hand, received explanations of honour from all sides, that he had not personally enriched himself. But he was also told that he had been a friend of the Phoebus Director Ernst Hugo Correll and had given his girlfriend Else Ektimov (or Elke Ekimoff) a 12-room apartment and a well-paid job at Phoebus.Berlinische Monatsschrift 6/2000 Since 1924, Lohmann had been involved with Phoebus-Film AG company. In addition to high returns, he also had the goal of being able to place agents in the Phoebus offices abroad without inconspicuous agents. When Phoebus got into trouble, he got her credit from the Girozentrale. He received the signature for the required guarantee only because he presented a further guarantee from the parent company, Lignose AG , which had priority. In fact, he had assured the Lignose, on the other hand, in the name of the empire, that it was not claimed for this guarantee. Later, he signed his own self- sufficient guarantees. When bankruptcy in August was no longer averted, the financing arrangement collapsed. Expos√© Kurd Wenkel, an economic journalist of the Berlin daily newspaper, had wondered since the middle of July 1927, through which inflows the company could delay its collapse for so long. After a former Phoebus employee informed him about the Lohmann investments, Wenkel publicly published the scandal in articles on August 8 and 9. He was probably not aware of the real background, but suspected that the state had in the national sense to influence the program and the rental policy of Phoebus, which was not quite unjustified, because in the shallow program of the Phoebus (one does not participate Of love ), a few nautical injections were noticeable (the northbound journey of German warships). The government under Reichskanzler Wilhelm Marx tried to limit the damage. The Wenkel articles were removed from publication under threat of prosecution for treason. The remote economic activities were portrayed as the authority of a subordinate official, and the Phoebus scandal became the Lohmann affair. The secret rearmament activities, and thus the breach of the Treaty of Versailles, could be hushed up. Although the KPD deputy Ernst Schneller in the Reichstag asked very precisely for details of the upgrade program, he was ignored. The Reichstag approved the costs for the settlement of the affair of 26 million RM only after the resignation of Reichswehrminister Otto Gessler on January 19, 1928. On 30 September, Gessler's successor Wilhelm Groener, dismissed the chief of the Reichsmarine, Admiral Hans Zenker, the direct superintendent of Lohmann. Lohmann himself was retired when his pension was abridged, but he was never prosecuted, because the risk of uncovering the true background of the affair would have been too great. Lohmann died completely impoverished three years later of a heart attack. The secret rearmament was not stopped, but extended, but subject to independent and secret control by the Court of Auditors. The naval intelligence service was merged into the defense of the army in 1928.Gert Buchheit: The German Secret Service.

The SPD suspected black coffers and demanded that the resources of the army and the navy should be limited by their budgetary resources and that their use should be monitored more closely.Caspar, Gustav Adolf: The Social Democratic Party and the German Wehrproblem in the Years of the Weimar Republic , in: Supplement 11 of the Wehrwissenschaftlichen Rundschau, Stuttgart 1959, p. 72 During 1929 appeared in the world stage an article, about the German aviation industry, in the magazine Die Weltb√ºhne, which revealed individual details of the continued secret armoury.

The game centers around a boy who deals with depression, anxiety, and fear as he embarks on a journey through different locations in search of his dog, Baron. The narrative changes with different pathways and endings depending on how the player interacts with the environment, other characters, and combat system. Each choice or interaction has the potential to change the game by adding dialog, encounters, or interactive objects to the world. An alpha version of the game was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux in November 2016 on Steam Greenlight. The game was greenlit by the community in ten days and received enough support to reach the top game on the platform for that time period. A beta was then released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux in February 2017 along with a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign. This campaign was successful within its first 24 hours, and the game is now in development for the final release. Initially scheduled for a full release in December 2017, the game is currently planned to be released in sections; an early access version of the game has been released in December 2018, and content will be added over time through patches.  Gameplay  Heartbound is a role-playing game that borrows many conventions from other gaming genres. Progress is achieved by exploration and player choice, and how the player interacts with the world shapes the story line and the environment for the rest of the play-through. According to the Pirate Software website: \\"Every time you interact with an object, talk to an NPC, forget to turn off a light-switch, take out the trash, or disregard a sparkly bush the game remembers this and will change subtly for all further interactions. The greatest part about this design is that it already works and is in the current builds of the game. Both minor and major differences are going to pop up throughout the game and give the community something to share with one another. Everything you do matters no matter what kind of player you are or choose to be.\\"  Alternate reality game  A series of cryptographic puzzles can be solved outside of Heartbound, accessible from the game's website. These puzzles provide additional lore and offer an alternative narrative parallel to the game. Completing portions of the Alternate reality game (ARG) can foreshadow or unlock additional game content.  Combat  279x279px Heartbound does not use the traditional systems of levels, experience, or consumables; everything is skill-based and combat can change based on the player's actions and relationships with others. Equipment can be found throughout the world, which augments Lore's damage and maximum health. Every enemy has unique mini-games that are not encountered anywhere else in the game. There are no random battles, and a number of encounters are avoidable based on how the player progresses.  Characters  = Home World = * Lore is the main protagonist of Heartbound. He is a troubled young man who routinely fights off internal turmoil and negative thoughts. His outlook can alter how he perceives both communication from others and the physical world around him. Together with his faithful companion, Baron, Lore manages to make it through each day. He has the bad habit of never cleaning up his socks, and they can be found nearly everywhere. * Baron is Lore's dog, guardian, and best friend. He overflows with happy-go-lucky positivity in every situation and always knows what to do. This helps to balance out Lore's innate negativity and unease. Baron has an intense fear of isolation and cannot function without Lore nearby. Because of their reliance on one another, the duo are essentially inseparable. * Binder is a mysterious old man who lives deep in the forest. He possesses immense strength of will and is incredibly stubborn. His home serves as a makeshift library, with tomes haphazardly littering the walls and floor. Binder knows a lot more than he lets on, but he prefers to allow others the pleasure of discovering things for themselves. Binder has an intense addiction to apples but will not admit this fact to any living soul. He also has the ability to speak in Guardian Glyphs. * Lore's father is mostly absent in Lore's life. He is somewhat rude to Lore, and is described as being in a bad mood most of the time. * The Barghest is a Darksider Lore meets in the forest after waking up and finding Baron to be missing. Its namesake is The Barghest of Northern English folklore. = Animus = * Ramul is a quick-witted and quick-footed rabbit who serves as the mailman in Animus. If you ever need a message delivered before you finish writing it, Ramul is the guy you need to see. His adoptive mother and father are Shelly and Sheldon Mossback. Sheldon dislikes Ramul's line of work and wishes that Ramul would slow down and do \\"real work\\" on the family farm. Ramul and Rem√© have been dating for a while but try to keep it low-key. * As the grand conspiracy theorist of the village, Rem√© is always up on the latest rumors and regards himself as the go-to source for news before it's news. He has an uncanny ability to detect vibrations in the ground and can hear others speaking from a great distance away. Rem√© is constantly cold in the generally chilly environment and wears winter clothing year round. Ramul and Rem√© have been dating for a while but try to keep it low-key. * As the resident outsider of the Animus, not much is known about Phil. He appeared one night and took up residence without a word to any of the other villagers. Rem√© claims that Phil is a government assassin sent to kill him but says if he cites any sources they would be \\"taken out\\" as well. Phil speaks using a strange dialect that results in bubbles filled with imagery depicting his thoughts appearing about his head whenever he talks. * Rhode spends most of her time combing the forests outside of Animus searching for medicinal herbs and beautiful flowers to sell. Rhode trades with Cirsi to provide materials for her alchemical creations. She spends a lot of time hanging out with Ramul and Rem√©, chatting about the latest news or dreams of the future. Pines over Fern but is far too shy to be forward enough for the oblivious deer to notice. * Fern is a deer possessing a singularly dominant personality. Fern appears to care nothing for the opinions of others and is very confident in herself. This confidence, however, is just a mask she uses to hide her immense self-doubt and worry. Most of her days are spent with Avocado reading hundreds of books aloud for the mole to transcribe. Because of her internal turmoil Fern is entirely unaware of Rhode's interest. * Seto is a great bear of immense power and the guardian of Animus. He watches over the village and would lay down his life for any of the other villagers. A stoic and aloof creature, Seto prefers a life of quiet solitude in a cave near the edge of the forest. Only the oldest remember the times before Seto, and they have nothing pleasant to say about it. * One of the most down to earth possums around, Cirsi serves as the village alchemist. Her tinctures and tonics help the crops grow and bring others back from the brink in times of sickness. She describes the villagers as \\"a bunch of downright animals\\" and is never afraid to say how she really feels about things even if it's not the most popular opinion. She spends much of her day creating new alchemical tinctures and taking care of her sister Carli. * Carli is a sister to Cirsi and one of the sweetest members of the village. She is exceptionally shy and prefers to stay indoors. Many months ago her mother's life was cut short in a terrible accident and she hasn't left the house since. Cirsi takes care of her and keeps her away from the other villagers. * Avocado is a small and mostly blind mole that is infatuated with books and puns of all kinds. She spends most of her time transcribing stories into braille with the help of her friend Fern. Avocado rarely leaves her home, but when she does, it's usually to pick up ink and supplies from Cirsi's shop. Her incredible hearing allows her to sense even the slightest movement. * Shelly Mossback is a kind and caring tortoise that walks the streets of Animus delivering food from Mossback Farms to the other villagers. In stark contrast to her husband, Shelly believes deeply in following Mania and strives to do something new and exciting each day. She loves her adopted son Ramul and wants him to follow his dreams and be whatever he wants to be. * An old snapping turtle, the owner of Mossback Farms, and husband to Shelly Mossback, Sheldon is a strong believer in Misery. He denounces Mania and sticks to his ways claiming that the earth provides for those with a routine and persistence. He dislikes the direction that his adopted son Ramul's life is going in and voices this frequently and vehemently. * Emelio is a gruff and no-nonsense blacksmith who builds all of the tools that keep the farm running. A strong believer in the primals, Emelio does everything he can to be productive and neutral in all aspects of his life. He's a very good friend of the Mossbacks and spends a lot of time talking to them. * Mania is the primal aspect of chaos, death, and madness. He can be found all around us in every terrible accident or lapse of judgement. He is the storm in sky threatening to overtake everything in an instant.

Multiplicative binary search was first described by Thomas Standish in 1980. This algorithm was originally proposed to simplify the midpoint index calculation on small computers without efficient division or shift operations. On modern hardware, the cache-friendly nature of multiplicative binary search makes it suitable for out-of-core search on block-oriented storage as an alternative to B-trees and B+ trees. For optimal performance, the branching factor of a B-tree or B+-tree must match the block size of the file system that it is stored on. The permutation used by multiplicative binary search places the optimal number of keys in the first (root) block, regardless of block size. Multiplicative binary search is used by some optimizing compilers to implement switch statements.  Algorithm  Multiplicative binary search operates on a permuted sorted array. Keys are stored in the array in level-order sequence of the corresponding balanced binary search tree. This places the first pivot of a binary search as the first element in the array. The second pivots are placed at the next two positions. Given an array A of n elements with values A0 ... An‚àí1, and target value T, the following subroutine uses multiplicative binary search to find the index of T in A. # Set i to 0 # if i ‚â• n, the search terminates unsuccessful. # if Ai = T, the search is done; return i. # if Ai < T, set i to 2√ói + 1 and go to step 2. # if Ai > T, set i to 2√ói + 2 and go to step 2.

It was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1796 and has been owned by the Tate Gallery since 1972. The painting measures . It depicts a moonlit view of fishermen on rough seas near the Needles, of the Isle of Wight. It juxtaposes the fragility of human life, represented by the small boat with its flickering lamp, and the sublime power of nature, represented by the dark clouded sky, the wide sea, and the threatening rocks in the background. The cold light of the Moon at night contrasts with the warmer glow of the fishermen's lantern. Years later, Turner made a similar sketch, Moonlight at Sea (The Needles), c.1818, as an example of marine art for his Liber Studiorum. The work shows strong influence from the work of marine artists such as Claude Joseph Vernet, Philip James de Loutherbourg, Peter Monamy and Francis Swaine, and the intimate nocturnal scenes of Joseph Wright of Derby. The image was praised by contemporary critics and founded Turner's reputation, as both an oil painter and a painter of maritime scenes. Art historian Andrew Wilton has commented that the image: \\"Is a summary of all that had been said about the sea by the artists of the 18th century.\\" According to Walter Thornbury, the work was sold to General Stewart for ¬£10. The painting was acquired by Sir Henry Charles Englefield; after his death in 1822, it was sold at Christie's on 8 March 1823, as View of the Needles, with the effect of Moon and Fire Light. It was bought by Englefield's nephew Francis Cholmeley, and it remained in the Cholmeley family for nearly 150 years, displayed at Brandsby Hall, and it became known as the Cholmeley Sea Piece. It was loaned regularly to the Tate Gallery from 1931, and sold to the Tate Gallery in 1972 by Francis William Alfred Fairfax-Cholmeley, with finance from the Beatrice Lizzie Benson Fund.

In the late 19th century up to the mid 20th century, Mindelo had the colony's busiest port once and brought influences to the island and around 1890, it became the most culturally renowned island together with Santiago once. Today it is the second most prominent in Cape Verde. Cuisine The most popular cuisine is cachupa as is in the rest of the nation. Delicacies originated from the island include Arroz de cabidela de marisco –∞ dadal which is the rice seafood dish fried moray, barnacle stew (guisado de percebes) and xer√©m. Literature The first issue of Claridade issued in 1936. It was a literary review along with other works published at the time that lef the struggle for freedom and independenceLiterature is one of the richest in the Cape Verde Islands, unlike other islands, recorded literature started in the late 19th century. Later on, Mindelo became a commonplace for literature in Cape Verde. In the early 20th century, works, books and poems were published, more of them were related to the independence struggle, in 1936, the Claridade review was published in the city and was considered an underground publication, it was closed in 1960,From classicism to realism in Claridade by Alberto CarvalhoThe Creation of a Creole Literature (pdf) several writers were exiled until after the Carnation Revolution of April 25, 1974, before Cape Verde became independent. Numerous works and poems continues to be published from the island even after the years after independence. Mindelo is home to the second public library in Cape Verde. Numerous institutions include the University of Cape Verde's campuses of Faculty of Science and Technology and the School of Maritime Sciences, the University of Mindelo and the Mindelo Lusophony University. Mindelo's first lyceum was Liceu D. Infante Henrique opened in 1912, it is now known as Escola Jorge Barbosa. Notable writers includes Corsino Fortes, Aguinaldo Fonseca, Ant√≥nio Aur√©lio Gon√ßalves, Thierry Gra√ßa, Baltasar Lopes da Silva, Manuel Lopes, Jo√£o Cle√≥fas Martins, Yolanda Morazzo, Osvaldo Os√≥rio, On√©simo Silveira and Jo√£o V√°rio.

Other than Chiquinho, three books were published by authors not native of the island. Arts and theater Mus√©u Artesanato (Artisan's Museum) or the National Artisan's Center, Mindelo Art is well known on the island, one of the latest to be founded. It is rich in art, it has an art center named Centro Nacional de Artesanato located north of the city center, it is a museum that features arts and paintings from the earlier times of the island. Theater dominates an important role in the island. It has the Mindelo Theatrical Festival which is a major festival in Cape Verde, its first edition was held in 1995, a year later, Mindelact, a theatrical association was founded. The most notable theatrical actor today is Jo√£o Branco who was born in France and immigrated from Portugal in 1991. Rich colonial architecture which includes neoclassical and late colonial are founded in the island capital. Newly constructed tall towers are founded in northwest, modern architecture are scattered in the outer areas of the city. Notable painters include Jo√£o Cleofas Martins, nicknamed Djunga Fotografo, Bit√∫, Manuel Figueira and Luisa Queir√≥s. Events Every late winter before Lent, the S√£o Vicente Carnival for many years has been the most important in Cape Verde. In one song, Ces√°ria √âvora mentioned it in \\"S√£o Vicent √™ um Brazilim\\" (probably also the name for the song \\"Carnaval de S√£o Vicente\\") indicating the similarity with the carnival in Brazil. Music Music was brought to the island in the start of the 19th century after the first settlement was founded and was the most recent to be introduced in Cape Verde. The music takes a dominant position of its culture on the island. The most significant genres are morna and coladeira. The island has its own morna variant which is a derivative of the Brava Morna. In the 1930s and the 1940s, the morna gained special characteristics in S√£o Vicente. The Brava style was much appreciated and cultivated in all Cape Verde by that time (there are records about E. Tavares being received in apotheosis in S. Vicente island and even the Barlavento composers wrote in Sotavento Creole,Rodrigues, Moacyr e Isabel Lobo, A Morna na Literatura Tradicional ‚Äî Instituto Cabo-verdiano do Livro, 1996 probably because the maintenance of the unstressed vowels in Sotavento Creoles gave more musicality). But specific conditions in S. Vicente such as the cosmopolitanism and openness to foreign influences brought some enrichment to the morna. The other music style of the island is coladeira, one of two centered in Mindelo, from S. Vicente this musical genre passed to the other islands.Gon√ßalves, C. F., Kab Verd Band ‚Äî 2006 Festival de Ba√≠a das Gatas was the first music festival that took place in 1984. Due to its enormous space, it has been the most popular music festival of Cape Verde. It may have become the second-most popular festival today to Praia da Gamboa on Santiago or Praia de Santa Maria on Sal. The most popular singer of all time was Ces√°ria √âvora, who was the first from the nation to reach world stage, second was Bana and he recorded the most songs and singles. Other singers and musicians include, Dudu Araujo, Bau, B. Leza (Francisco Xavier da Cruz), Herm√≠nia da Cruz Fortes, Dj√¥ d'Eloy, Fantcha, Jotamont, Belinda Lima, Lu√≠s Morais, Eddy Moreno, Tito Paris, Titina (Albertina) Rodrigues, Jovino dos Santos, Lela Viol√£o and Robert and Val Xalino. Rappers include Boss AC and Eddy Fort Moda Grog, both of them immigrated to Europe and recorded its tracks there. The most famous composer is Vasco Martins who is the first Capeverdean to perform symphonies and orchestral music. One of the songs based on or set on a locality on the island includes \\"Salamansa\\", \\" S√£o Vicente di Longe\\" and \\"Rogamar\\" by Ces√°ria √âvora and \\"Avenida Marginal\\" by Bana. Some of the songs were related to the famine and starvation that happened on the island as was with the rest of Cape Verde in the mid 20th century and emigrants in other countries (some descendants) which was common especially in the 1950s. The most popular albums from the island were S√£o Vicente di Longe with its tracks mainly set on parts of the island and most of all Voz d'Amor and Rogamar (2006).

Best known for her paintings, her work incorporates both mythical and spiritual iconography. In 1932 she attended a seance held in the home of Rev. Ida L. Ewing, the pastor of The National Federation of Spiritual Science, Church No. 68, in Santa Ana, California. Peavy first encountered \\"Lacamo\\", a spirit from another world whom she called her \\"spirit muse,\\" while in a trance during one of the weekly meetings. Afterward when she painted, she claimed that Lacamo directed her brush. She sometimes wore a mask to channel Lacamo‚Äôs energy. Her paintings were exhibited in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York during her life time and have recently resurfaced in exhibitions. The works reflect her (and Lacamo‚Äôs) belief that humanity was slowly moving toward an androgynous species, which she called ‚Äúone-gender perfection,‚Äù through contact with alien species, or UFOs (Unidentified Foreign Objects). In her consideration of a future-sex and post-masculine world, Peavy‚Äôs work aligns with that of Hilma af Klint, Agnes Pelton, and Forest Bess.  Early life  Paulina Peavy was born Pauline Ellen White in Old Colorado City, Colorado (now part of Colorado Springs) on August 24, 1901. In 1906, Peavy's family moved to Portland, Oregon, where she attended both elementary school and high school. When Peavy was six, her mother died, leaving her to live with her father. In her unpublished manuscript The Story of My Life with a ‚ÄúUFO,‚Äù Peavy recalls that ‚Äúit was my father‚Äôs belief that education would be wasted on girls - as they only shall marry and bear children.‚Äù Instead of a traditional high school, Peavy attended the Girl‚Äôs Polytechnic School in Portland, Oregon, where courses focused heavily on cooking and sewing. In 1923, Peavy graduated from Oregon State College, with a Bachelor of Science in Vocational Education. She likely met her future husband, Bradley A. Peavey (b. 1890), as a student. They married in 1922. The Peavy family was powerful in Corvallis, Oregon ‚Äî Bradley‚Äôs father, George Wilcox Peavy, was the Dean of Forestry at the time. While Paulina Peavy lived there, he would become the president of the college, and later the mayor of Corvallis. The couple left Oregon, however, and moved to southern California, where Peavy gave birth to her first son, Bradley Adelbert Peavy, in 1924 in San Pedro, California. She gave birth to her second, Wesley Peavy, two years later in 1926. As a young woman, Paulina found herself married to an alcoholic man prone to violence. While Paulina was in a sanitarium for tuberculosis around 1930, her husband Bradley took both boys to his parents‚Äô house in Oregon. When Paulina recovered, she retrieved the boys from Oregon and eventually won custody later that year. Independent for the first time in her life, Paulina Peavy and her two sons settled in Long Beach, California. By teaching art in local schools, she supported the family. For a period of time in 1932, she left the boys in an orphanage called The Boys and Girls Aid Society in Pasadena, California. According to a later interview in a New York newspaper called the Brooklyn Eagle, she taught architectural design in the art department of a junior high school in Long Beach for 14 years. At some point in the 1930s, while teaching for the Los Angeles Board of Education, Peavy took courses at the Chouinard School of Fine Art in Los Angeles (now part of the California Institute of the Arts) on an Art Advanced scholarship. Although an undated resume she later wrote says she finished her MA, school records do not substantiate that claim. After living in Los Angeles and San Francisco from 1923 to 1942, she moved to New York, New York, where she remained until the age of 97.  Spiritual and philosophical ideas  This is a page of Peavy's manuscript defining her seasons. In 1932, Peavy began attending weekly s√©ances at the Long Beach home of Ida Ewing of Long Beach, whom she described as \\"a trance medium.\\" It was there that she said she first met Lacamo (pronounced LA-cum-mo), a spirit that Peavy called a UFO, or ‚ÄúUnidentified Foreign Object.‚Äù Although Lacamo originally channeled his communications through Ewing, eventually the spirit would \\"spoke\\" directly to Peavy. In her 1982 film, Mountain of Myrrh/UFO, she describes her first encounter with the UFO as seeing a \\"great cloud and fire unfolding itself, and a brightness was about itself, the color of amber. . . . The spirit of the living creations was in the wheels. As for this ring [meaning sound], they were so high they were dreadful. Wherever the living creature went, the wheels went. The flying saucer‚Äôs spacecraft form is planetary, consisting of an aggregation of hierarchical egos, a vast pulsating living power unit, promulgated as seed around a central nucleus. Being seed in constant metamorphosis, they create themselves mentally by the brow in any form in any place in the universe and by feat of travel that their thought enacts upon. Their genesis is wholly mental.\\"Mountain of Myrrh/The UFO, 1982, 25.5 minutes. Lacamo, through Ewing, instructed Peavy to read Isis Unveiled (1877) by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, a Russian philosopher and co-founder of the Theosophical Society whose ideas inspired the work of other artists like Hilma af Klint. The Bible and Christian Theology figured prominently in Peavy's work throughout her life. A 1946 article by Margaret Mara published in the Brooklyn Eagle reads, ‚ÄúInterpreting the parables in the Bible with a paint brush is the gigantic task undertaken by Paulina Peavy, modernistic painter, who has evolved some amazing theories following 10 years of biblical research.‚Äù But her philosophy of the cosmos moved beyond established theosophical and religious tests. She also recalls that Lacamo instructed her to ‚Äúreduce all capitallised [sic] words in the Bible- to their low case and then wholly scientific meanings; as example- biology- embryology- etc.!‚Äù Through these synthetic visions, her philosophy and images combined modern conventions of science with historical religious philosophy. Lacamo continued to teach Peavy and co-author works with her for over 50 years. For Peavy, Lacamo existed beyond human conceptions of gender and identity. According to her, Lacamo revealed a vision of the future in which single-sex female reproduction would render men unnecessary. Her worldview hinged on the idea that humans were continually reincarnated until they became ‚Äúpharaohs,‚Äù or ‚Äúfree souls‚Äù who had achieved ‚Äúone-gender perfection.\\" In her art, pyramids represent this evolution. Over time, she developed a philosophy that the world evolved through 12,000 year cycles composed of four seasons of 3,000 years each‚Äîthe spring age, summer pyramid age, autumn age, and winter age. ‚ÄúThe male‚Äù only appeared during the winter age, which she also referred to as ‚ÄúBabel.‚Äù In her writings, films, and paintings, Peavy advanced her belief that humankind was ‚Äúnearing the end of our 3,000 year age- likened to a prolonged WINTER‚Äù and that soon the spring age, where humanity ascended to ‚Äúone-gender perfection‚Äù would arrive. Curator Bill Arning has drawn a connection between Peavy and radical feminists like Valerie Solanis, who wrote a book called the SCUM Manifesto arguing that men were an unnecessary evil. Her paintings were revealed to her. She felt herself to be the physical maker, but not the spiritual author. Through the act of painting and revising, which she did continually, the images revealed their meaning to her over a long span of time.  Work  As an artist, Peavy worked in painting, drawing, sculpture, writing, poetry, and film. Her work, particularly her mixed-media and Phantasma series, developed a personal symbology consisting of shapes that resembled energy beams, solar systems, and organic shapes that represented ovaries, genitalia, sperm, and fetuses. = Paintings, drawings, and mixed- media = Working in thin layers of jewel-toned oil paint, Peavy composed multi-layered images with translucent colors that often referenced her belief in an electric and cosmic relationship between the human brain and higher sources. Her subjects range from her earlier representational works, like the paintings she exhibited at the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco, California, to abstract works of geometric and organic shapes symbolizing reincarnation and fertility. Most of her works are undated, but it is presumed that she began working in this style during the 1930s, perhaps while at the Chouinard School of Fine Arts, and continued through the 1970s. In an interview with the Brooklyn Eagle, Peavy describes her technique as \\"a revolt in art school teachings as well as being the result of research in the bible.‚Äù In the same interview, she says, ‚ÄúMy paintings attempt to ‚Äòcreate life‚Äô on canvas, even as my mother created me and as I created my two sons.‚Äù Her oil paintings have a hard, almost mirrored surface that resembles enamel as a result of her painting style. During the 1970s and 1980s, she returned to many of her earlier paintings and reworked them in sharper shapes that resembled crystals. Because of this practice a single painting can represent decades of work. In her 1987 film, UFO Identified, Peavy describes her watercolors as depicting creation, or conception: ‚ÄúLight at the moment of conception, the seed nuclear. The tongue of flames ascend and descend of the egg nucleus and then there is light.\\"UFO Identified, 1987 Between 1975 and 1984, Peavy began working with watercolor, pen, collage, and ink. She often signed both these later works and her earlier ones with her name as well as Lacamo‚Äôs. Many of the watercolors are dated. The earliest is dated to 1953. In addition, some have two dates, suggesting that she would return to a work many years later. = Exhibition and critical reception = The complexity of her constructed cosmos and the technical skill with which she executed her images occasionally stymied, but often impressed reviewers and the public. From 1933 to 1942, Peavy exhibited at the San Diego Museum, Civic Center Museum of San Francisco, Stanford University, the Gump Galleries in San Francisco, the Stendahl Gallery in Los Angeles, and the Palos Verdes Gallery in Palos Verdes. In 1935, she stayed with Brigadier General Charles F. Humphrey and his wife. The visit was recorded in the Army and Navy Journal, which described her as ‚Äúa noted California artist.‚ÄùArmy and Navy Journal - Volume 73 - Page 430 https://books.google.com/books?id=x38XAQAAMAAJ In 1939, she was invited to participate in the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco, California, where she painted a large panel entitled ‚ÄúThe Last Supper.\\" Artist Diego Rivera was on site painting a mural at the same time. Peavy‚Äôs panel was fourteen by six feet and painted on stretched canvas. The original image was a representational depiction of Jesus Christ at the center, surrounded by other female figures. She brought the painting with her to New York and, as with many of her works, she eventually painted over it and renamed the image \\"Crystallization of Matter.\\" That painting was destroyed when Peavy moved to Bethesda, Maryland, at the end of her life in 1997. Fortunately, a partial original image survived as a postcard. The later painting, an abstract mosaic of pyramids and other geometric shapes, demonstrates how her work evolved, as she documents in her book The Story of My Life With a \\"UFO\\" and in her films from the 1980‚Äôs. The reception of her work at the exposition was mixed, but she considered the event a highlight of her life. At the time, a major art critic, Alfred Frankenstein, found some of her work was ‚Äúquite good,‚Äù but that the majority were ‚Äúcurious affairs, glazed hard as mirrors, making much rather monotonous use of concentric circles in drapery, beads, aureoles and curlicues of sorts.‚Äù In response, Peavy wrote a letter to the editor entitled ‚ÄúArtist Amazed‚Äù: > I wish to thank Mr. Frankenstein for reviewing my exhibitions at the Temple > of Religion, but I am amazed that he, with the reputation of being one of > the most intelligent art critics of the Bay Area, has followed the examples > of unthinking people throughout the ages‚Äîthat is, to condemn that which they > do not understand. Might it have ever occurred to Mr. Frankenstein that the > queer gyrations of my paintings, as he has expressed it, might be an > expression of the same God-given fundamental principles (as yet not > understood) embodied in the structural and philosophical principles of the > ancient Pyramids and even the ancient Egyptians‚Äô art? Three years later, for reasons not entirely known, Peavy moved from Long Beach, California, to New York, New York. The only record she has left of her decision is in her unpublished manuscript, The Story of My Life with a \\"UFO\\": \\"The dictionary defined ‚Äòdestiny‚Äô- as ‚Äò-that which is to happen to a particular person or thing.‚Äô And so, obviously it was in my destiny to move to New York in 1942.\\" According to an undated resume she composed while in New York, between 1942 and 1943 Peavy exhibited at the Delphic Studios, New York City. In 1943, Peavy had her first solo exhibition in Manhattan at the Argent Gallery. Art Digest's Maud Riley wrote a glowing review of her exhibition in an article entitled ‚ÄúElectronics in Paint‚Äù: > Mrs. Peavy has technical equipment equal to Dali. But instead of using her > inherent ability developed, certainly, in the cases of both by dint of long > hard work to give vicarious thrilled of the unnatural and decadent, as Dali > does, this artist tells a tale of the abstract forces of thought abroad in > the world and attempts to give validity to the belief that the mind is real. > She gives form to the ‚Äòelectronic structure,‚Äô and these forms are no more > unworldly than Dali‚Äôs melting watches. To do this, the artist devised a > technique that defies analysis. She paints plasmas similarly to Matta‚Äôs, > uses church window colors of intense reds and blues, creates forms which are > neither plant nor animal nor human. But they are not 'non-objective.' For > many are built around the figures of Biblical characters and there is deep > beauty in the faces of the subjects. Two reviews also ran in the New York Herald Tribune, one entitled ‚ÄúMystic Symbolism.‚Äù The other was by Carlyle Burrows, who called Peavy an ‚Äúextraordinary creative talent, curiously romantic in its implications.\\" Throughout the 1940s, galleries continued to exhibit her work. In 1945, she showed her ‚ÄúWaterflames,‚Äù ‚ÄúConception,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSea of Life‚Äù series, as well as a painting called ‚ÄúThe Supper of Peace,‚Äù at the Jurart Gallery at Sixth Avenue and Forty-sixth street. A year later, the Lawrence Terzian Gallery, 545 Fifth Avenue, New York, hosted a show of her work that was called ‚ÄúGenesis, Atomic Forces of Nature.‚Äù The New York Times ran an ambiguous review of the exhibition, while The Brooklyn Eagle printed a more favorable column on the paintings by Margaret Mara called ‚ÄúIn Awe of Creative Powers, Impressionistic Painter of Biblical Parables Has Theories on Atom.‚Äù \\"In each of her paintings the artist depicts birth,‚Äù Mara writes, ‚Äúwhich she describes as ‚Äòthe multiplying power of the human atom or life cell.‚Äô\\" By 1948, Peavy's work was being featured on posters sold by the American Cancer Society for fundraising purposes, who described her as ‚Äúdedicating her life to a rich interpretation of the Bible.‚Äù Yet in the following decade, other than her development of a manikin made of articulated blocks for drawing in 1954, she seems to disappear from public view. She must, however, have remained active as an artist and public figure because she appeared in live broadcasts of the Long John Nebel talk show on WOR in both 1958 and 1960. Nebel invited guests who had experienced paranormal events, including witchcraft, ghosts, UFOs, conspiracy theorists, and parasychology. Between 1954 and 1962, the show aired from midnight to 5:30 am seven days a week, and amassed a significant following across the continental United States. Peavy wore a mask, which Nebel described on air, and was in a trance through most of the interview. Lacamo spoke through her during the trance, and said \\"...we are using her exactly as you use your microphone. We are beings existing.\\"(Long John Nebel Show, January 1958 \\"The Mystic Barber of Brooklyn - Andy Sinatra\\")(\\"The Age of Flying Saucers\\" by Paris Flammonde)) Over the last thirty years of her life, Peavy seems to have continued producing and exhibiting art, although she increasingly began to use film and text as her mediums. In 1961, the New York Tribune listed an exhibition of her recent paintings in Crown Gallery, 881 Seventh Ave, New York. On her undated resume, she wrote that she had produced 1,000 paintings, a number she would have certainly surpassed by the end of her life. = Masks = The mask that Peavy wore when she appeared on the Long John Nebel show in 1958 and 1960 was just one of many that she created to facilitate a deeper trance. Her creativity depended on achieving a dream- state, where she could contact the higher plane where Lacamo resided. Peavy often cut the base of the mask out of leather, or other materials such as velvet or lace. Using beads, feathers, lace, buttons, and costume jewelry, she would decorate each mask individually. Each received titles like ‚ÄúRoyal Foursquare‚Äù, ‚ÄúDuo Genius‚Äù or ‚ÄúMonumental Redundant. In 1967, she received a patent (72185234) for an invention called ‚ÄúMask-Ezz,‚Äù which she describes as ‚Äúadhesive facial covering devices and the like described as self-adhesive skin covering devices in sheet form, the adhesive layer of which impregnated with substances conducive to stimulating healing of the skin and layers therebelow [sic] when placed against the skin.\\" It is unclear when she began making the masks, but they featured heavily in her later films, especially the 1985 film entitled The Artist Behind the Mask. = Writings and Films = Peavy only began committing her philosophical ideas to the page later in life. In 1959, she began an unpublished manuscript entitled Various Kinds of Dissertations, which recorded various conversations with Lacamo and laid out her vision of the cosmos. When she finally finished the book in 1973, it was 121 pages long. She began to write poetry as well, including ‚ÄúVoice from Higher Dimensions‚Äù in 1960, which she claimed Lacamo had written through her. In another poem entitled ‚ÄúResurrection of Atoms,‚Äù she articulates her view that reincarnation as a woman is the step before one-gender perfection as a pharaoh: > Therefore, as each female had been all sub-creature forms ‚Äì Including a > human male, ultimately she has graduated out from All lower creature forms- > eventually becoming a pharaoh (fair-oh)- And as a ‚Äúcreator pharaoh‚Äù- and > eventually she Graduates within the so-called higher dimension- as a UFO! In the late 1980s, Peavy began writing her unpublished manuscript, The Story of My Life with a \\"UFO\\". Although the book is undated, she does mention the diseases Alzheimer‚Äôs, which did not become a major concern until 1977, and the Auto Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which was not discussed nationally until the mid-1980s. In 1993, she copyrighted five manuscript books: Various Kinds of Dissertations, which was a compilation of various writings; The Mad Nightingale In Search of God; A Spoof On Psychology, Biology, Sexology, Symbology, Government, and Religion, which was written by Peavy and Lacamo according to the title page; Psychology of Art and Composition, which was largely a design book without text; Philosophy & Poetry, also jointly-authored by Peavy and Lacamo; and The Story of My Life with a \\"UFO.\\" Peavy‚Äôs earliest film was Paulina, Artist-Philosopher, An Artist of Vision, which she copyrighted in 1981. That year, she exhibited it in the International Film & TV Festival of New York, where it won a bronze medal. For the next three years, she annually entered a film into the festival. In 1982, she won a bronze medal for Mountain of Myrrh, and another for Is the Moon a Burned-Out Sun in 1983. Male Sex then won her a silver award in 1984, and The Artist Behind the Mask won her final Bronze medal in 1985. Her films feature many of her paintings, which she narrates and describes in a calm voices accompanied by lilting music. Each capture a different aspect of her philosophy. Her final film, copyrighted in 1988, is Phantasma, Sixty Oil Paintings, A Self Portrait. Later life Very little is known of Peavy‚Äôs personal life after she moved to New York, NY, in 1942. Her undated resume, left behind in ephemera kept by her family, sketches a faint picture of her movements. At the top of the page, her address reads 390 West End Avenue, New York, NY, which places her in the Upper West Side. A marketing postcard lists an address at 320 West 78th Street. She seems to have held various jobs, from an art teacher for the New York City Board of Education to an architectural and engineer drafts-person for various companies. In addition, she lists herself as a lecturer at City College New York and at the American Museum of Natural History, where she spoke about ‚ÄúPhillians.‚Äù Although she showed at many galleries, she did not seem to find much commercial success. Likely, she supported herself by working odd jobs and teaching art. A 1954 article in the New York Herald Tribune describing the theft of a valuable statuette of Mrs. Dwight D. Eisenhower from a booth at the National Antique Show in Madison Square Garden describes a ‚ÄúMrs. Pauline Peavy‚Äù as an assistant at the hall. According to her family, she began showing signs of dementia around 1996. Her son Bradley moved her to a nursing home in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1998 after she broke her hip. She died there in 1999, at the age of 98.  Legacy  Despite some success during her lifetime, Peavy was relatively forgotten by the time she died. Her family kept her papers, paintings, and drawings, tucked away in a basement corner. A retrospective of her work, A Message to Paulina, was held at the Greater Reston Art Center in 2018; a Washington Post review described it as \\"exuberant, kaleidoscopic and beckoning\\". The Andrew Edlin Gallery has represented her work since 2016. In 2018, Peavy's paintings were included in the gallery's group exhibition \\"April 14, 1561.\\" Roberta Smith reviewed the exhibition in The New York Times, and mentioned Peavy's work: ‚ÄúThe abstractions representing Ms. Peavy here suggest brightly colored embryos or sleek flying saucers drifting among amniotic fluids or intergalactic ethers.‚Äù As interest in previously overlooked female spiritualist artists like Hilma af Klint and Emma Kunz grows, the art world has begun to recognize Paulina Peavy's achievements as an artist. Artist Jane Kaplowitz chose the 2019 exhibition of Paulina Peavy's work at the Andrew Edlin Gallery as her most memorably exhibition of 2019 in Artforum round up of artists' artists.

She served as chair of form and drawing in the College for the Training of Teachers, president of the art department of the National Education Association, and director of the art department in the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry (now known as Drexel University). Early years and education Hannah True was born in Portland, Maine, the only child of Jonathan True and Hannah True, his wife. Carter's father was a wealthy importer and commission merchant. Her mother died young, leaving her infant daughter to the care of a devoted father who, early recognizing the artistic tastes of his child, gave her considerable training in that direction. Career In 1868, she became the wife of Henry Theophilus Carter, a mechanical engineer and manufacturer. The marriage was happy and congenial, with wealth and high social standing. Financial losses, the failing health of her husband, the death of a child, and the loneliness of widowhood all came in quick succession, forcing her to look for ways to support herself and a child. With the life insurance left her by her husband, Carter entered the Massachusetts Normal Art School (now known as Massachusetts College of Art and Design) and was graduated with high standing. After a year's further study with private teachers in first-class studios, she went to Kingston, Canada, to direct an art school, where she succeeded in establishing the school on a permanent basis. At the close of the first year, she was obliged to return to Boston, as the climate of Canada was too severe for her health. For two years, she was associated with the Prang Educational Company, of that city, doing various work pertaining to its educational department, such as illustrating drawing-books and often acting as drawing supervisor. In the fall of 1887, she was called to New York City to take the chair of professor of form and drawing in the College for the Training of Teachers, and in 1890, she was elected president of the art department of the National Educational Association. In 1891, she was made director of the art department in the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Carter was appointed on many industrial, educational and art committees. She had an interest in general art education, believing enthusiastically in the necessity of educating and elevating public taste by beginning early with the training of children for a love of the aesthetic.

Its most prominent era occurred in the late 1970s among post-punk acts who embraced black dance styles. Characteristics Critic Simon Reynolds described avant-funk as \\"difficult dance music\\" and a kind of psychedelia in which \\"oblivion was to be attained not through rising above the body, rather through immersion in the physical, self loss through animalism.\\" Simon Frith described avant-funk as an application of progressive rock mentality to rhythm rather than melody and harmony. Some motifs of the style in the 1970s and 1980s included \\"Eurodisco rhythms; synthesizers used to generate not pristine, hygienic textures, but poisonous, noisome filth; Burroughs‚Äô cut-up technique applied to found voices.\\" History Talking Heads combined funk with elements of punk and art rock. Early acts who have retrospectively been described with the term include German krautrock band Can, American funk artists Sly Stone and George Clinton, and jazz trumpeter Miles Davis. Herbie Hancock's 1972 album Sextant was called an \\"uncompromising avant-funk masterpiece\\" by Paste. Jazz saxophonist Ornette Coleman led the avant-funk band Prime Time in the 1970s and 1980s. Guitarist James \\"Blood\\" Ulmer, who performed with Coleman in the 1970s, was described by The New Yorker as \\"one of avant-funk's masters.\\" According to Reynolds, a pioneering wave of avant-funk artists came in the late 1970s, when post-punk artists (including Public Image Ltd, Liquid Liquid, and James Chance, as well as Cabaret Voltaire, Talking Heads, The Pop Group, DAF, A Certain Ratio, and 23 Skidoo) embraced black dance music styles such as funk and disco. Reynolds noted these artists' preoccupations with issues such as alienation, repression and the technocracy of Western modernity. The artists of the late 1970s New York no wave scene also explored avant-funk, influenced by Ornette Coleman. Later groups such as Skinny Puppy, Chakk, 400 Blows represented later waves of the style. By the mid 1980s, it had dissipated, with many of its practitioners becoming a part of the UK's first wave of house music.

She declined to endorse any of the candidates vying to replace her. Among the primary candidates, County Supervisor Susan Golding and City Councilmember Ron Roberts ran on their experience in local government. Economist Peter Navarro and businessman Tom Carter ran as political outsiders. Navarro also emphasized his advocacy for slow-growth policies as chairman of the grassroots organization Prevent Los Angelization Now! (PLAN). Navarro considered himself a conservative Republican, but had changed his affiliation to independent prior to the primary election. In the primary election held June 2, 1992, Navarro placed first with 38.2 percent of the vote followed by Golding with 31.1 percent.

Background At the outset of the First Seminole War, Andrew Jackson was called upon to proceed with his Tennessee and Georgia militias into southern Georgia and, if need be, northern Florida to bring about peace. Overzealous as he was, he took his bloated company, by then joined by friendly Lower Creek and Chehaw, and ran amok throughout Spanish Florida, capturing the Spanish towns of St. Marks and Pensacola. In doing so, however, he left southern Georgia settlers unprotected to the few hostile Lower Creek tribes who were emboldened by his absence. In lieu of these events, Governor William Rabun was forced to dispatch for a part of Jackson's army. However, Jackson was too far gone so as to effectively comply at the time, so Rabun issued orders for a militia at Hartford on April 4, 1818 made up of volunteers from Twiggs and Jones counties as well as a contingent of federal troops from Fort Early. This company, led by Captain Obed Wright, would seek to punish the two identified hostile tribes, the Phelemmes and the Hoppones along the Flint River by way of surprise.Coulter, 1965. p. 372 Attack On April 21, Wright embarked with 270 men for Chehaw, which he had decided to attack instead, because he believed a chief of the Hoppones had taken up residence there, the result of being \\"misled by false information\\". With that, he left without the fort commander who refused to accompany him, insisting Chehaw was a friendly village. Nevertheless, the next day, with little resistance, Wright's force burned the village down, killing 40 to 50 warriors (or so Wright claimed at the time) in the process without any U.S. loss of life. Meanwhile, seven other accounts saw the death toll between five and ten.Coulter, 1965. p. 374. Conflicting Accounts The death toll wasn't the only fact disputed and it wasn't the most contentious. One second hand account in the local paper claimed an Indian man emerged from his house with a white flag, only to be murdered alongside his son, while another explained how the militia were the ones waving a white flag, but that it was done in order to trick the Chehaw into a false sense of security.Coulter, 1965. p. 374. A decade later, Jackson himself, used the event as a sort of propaganda in his 1832 campaign for the presidency. Author of Jackson's biography, Philo A. Goodwin, who had defended Jackson's campaign into Florida, embellished the cruelty and barbarism on display that fateful day: \\"a deeper stain of dishonor or a more intense visitation of wo [sic], was never seen or inflicted, than at the secluded village of the Chehaws.\\" Reaction While many newspapers including the Augusta Chronicle, Savannah Republican, National Intelligencer and Niles' Register strongly criticized Wright's actions, Judge C. B. Strong of the Georgia Superior Court and Governor Rabun, \\"who took on the responsibility\\", rushed to his defense.Coulter, 1965. p. 376-7. The events would have remained relatively local in newsworthiness had it not been for Jackson, who upon hearing of them, was furious for it was at Chehaw where he'd been generously resupplied and joined by 40 brave warriors. In a letter to one of his subordinates on May 7, he wrote of an \\"outrageous and inhuman attack\\" that \\"will be a stigma on the American nation, unless the general government use their endeavors to bring the perpetrators to justice.\\" He then wrote a scolding letter to Governor Rabun ordering the arrest and military prosecution of Wright.Coulter, 1965. p. 378. Rabun responded with indignation, pointing to Jackson's non-response to his earlier letter in Florida. Both followed up by writing Secretary of War John C. Calhoun on the matter.Coulter, 1965. p. 379-80. This correspondence, which thusly continued for some time, was published nationally.Coulter, 1965. p. 381. Once again, editors, this time across the country, including those at the Georgia Journal and Richmond Enquirer, saw the military man, Jackson, in the wrong for his temperance toward Rabun and assertions regarding the Governor's authority.Coulter, 1965. p. 381. Legal Action On December 10, 1818, a resolution introduced to the House by Henry R. Storrs of New York requested copies of any correspondence between Rabun, Jackson and the executive departments and on the 12th President Monroe complied. Monroe later requested Congress seek all documents relating to the Chehaw Affair, which Thomas W. Cobb of Georgia and Abner Lacock of Pennsylvania requested at the President's wishes.Coulter, 1965. p. 381-2. Meanwhile, William McIntosh, in correspondence with Jackson, sought to bring the men who had murdered his uncle (chief of Chehaw) and the inhabitants of the village to justice. He called for an assembly of the Creek nation on June 7, 1819.Coulter, 1965. p. 382. In the end, Indian Agent David Brydie Mitchell was provided with $10,000 by the U.S. government, with which to compensate the Chehaws. As for the fate of Wright, he was located and arrested by Major John M. Davis. Davis was forced to release him, however, while passing through the state capital, then located in Milledgeville, on his way to Fort Hawkins after a Georgia Inferior Court ruled in Davis' favor. Once he was released, Governor Rabun had him arrested so that he could be tried by a United States civil court rather than one of Jackson's martial courts.Coulter, 1965. p. 385-6. Having received letters urging for both outcomes, President Monroe conferred with Secretaries John Quincy Adams and William H. Crawford on June 26, reaching the conclusion that Wright should fall under the circuit court's jurisdiction unless they should disclaim him.Worthington c. Ford, ed., Writings of John Quincy Adams (7 vols. New York, 1913-19.17), VI, 358-59; In the meantime, Wright, unaware of the relative victory in Washington, caught wind of a rumor published in the Savannah Republican that he would be tried before a special court for murder. So, in the darkness of the night on July 27, as Niles' Register reported, Wright \\"took the fatal resolution to flee from justice\\" fearing \\"that his conduct would not be impartially investigated.\\"Coulter, 1965. p. 390. He was months later spotted one last time by an acquaintance in St. Augustine, Florida on his way to Havana, Cuba.

Describing the Chehaw as a \\"friendly agricultural people...who aided our early settlers\\", it proceeds to (fittingly) put forth its own version of the events: \\"Here also, in 1818, through misunderstanding, were sacrificed seven of this tribe by Georgia troops, for which all possible amends were made.\\"Coulter, 1965. p. 369.

A partlet or partlett is a fashion accessory of the sixteenth century. The partlet was a sleeveless garment worn over the neck and shoulders, or to fill in a low neckline. The earliest partlets appeared in late 15th century fashion. They were made of silk or linen, and were worn to fill in the low V necklines of both men's and women's Burgundian dress. Men continued to wear partlets, usually of rich materials, with the low-cut doublets of the early 16th-century. Early 16th-century women's partlets were made in a variety of fabrics and colors, although black was most popular. Black partlets worn over the gown, usually of velvet or satin for the upper classes are an early style. A wardrobe warrant of June 1538 ordered black velvet for a \\"French partlet\\" for Princess MaryHayward (2007), p. 166 These black partlets may be seen in a number of portraits of Tudor court ladies by Hans Holbein the Younger, as well as in Netherlandish paintings of market women throughout the sixteenth century. Fine lawn (linen) partlets, with small standing collars and ruffles, could be worn directly over a low-necked smock, or over the kirtle. The \\"Pelican\\" portrait of Elizabeth I shows the Elizabethan fashion for matching partlet and sleeves worked with blackwork embroidery, in this instance covered with a sheer layer of cypress decorated with narrow stripes of gold lace. Such sets of parlet and sleeves were common New Year's gifts to the queen. In 1562 Lady Cobham gave her \\"a partelett and a peire of sleeves of sypers wrought with silver and black silke\\". Elaborate lattice-work partlets were made of gold and jewels or pearls, such as that worn by Eleanor of Toledo in the portrait by Bronzino. This was called \\"Caulle fashion\\" in England.Hayward (2007), p. 167 The origin of the term partlet (attested from 1515) is uncertain, but it may derive from Dame Partlet, a traditional name for a hen, perhaps in reference to the ruffle of feathers on some hens' necks. For similar garments, see guimpe and chemisette.

In 1951, Alves made history when she and actor Walter Forster performed the first on-screen kiss ever broadcast on Brazilian television on the early telenovela series, Sua Vida Me Pertence. In 1963, Alves made television history once again by sharing the first gay kiss shown on Brazilian television with actress Ge√≥rgia Gomide on the teleteatro show, TV de Vanguarda. Additionally, Alves co-founded the Associa√ß√£o dos Pioneiros da Televis√£o, or Association of Television Pioneers (Pr√≥-TV), in 1995 and operated the Museu da Televis√£o Brasileira from her home in S√£o Paulo. Biography Vida Alves was born on April 15, 1928, in Itanhandu, a mining city in Minas Gerais. She moved to the city of S√£o Paulo to pursue acting. She began her career in radio before transitioning to film and early television roles. Her film roles included Paix√£o Tempestuosa in 1954 and A Pequena √ìrf√£ in 1973. Alves was cast in Sua Vida Me Pertence, Brazil's first telenovela and a pioneer of the television genre, which debuted on TV Tupi in 1951. She co- starred in the series with Walter Forster, an actor who was also TV Tupi's director. In 1951, Alves and Forster shared the first on-screen kiss ever broadcast on Brazilian television. Alves and Forster rehearsed their scene in her living room under the watch of her husband, Gianni Gasparinetti, who gave his permission. Alves and Gasparinetti were newlyweds at the time and Forster was a close friend of the couple. According to Alves, who spoke of the scene in a December 2016 interview, \\"We [She and Forster] lived very close, a block away...It was a technical kiss. Walter Foster showed up at my house and said, 'Let's rehearse.' My husband thought it was kind of weird, but he agreed.\\" Alves historic kiss was performed live on television and not taped, so unfortunately no copy of Brazil's first on-screen kiss exists. Alves called the early telenovelas aired in the 1950s \\"simpler\\" than today's series, since the shows were only broadcast two or three times per week, rather than airing daily episodes. During the 1950s and 1960s, TV Tupi also aired a teleteatro show called TV de Vanguarda, which broadcast television adaptations of literary novels and plays. Teleteatro were a type of Brazilian television show that featured a complete story arc with a beginning, middle and ending broadcast in a single, two-hour episode. In 1963, Alves appeared in an episode of the series called A Cal√∫nia in which she and actress Ge√≥rgia Gomide shared a kiss, marking the first gay kiss ever broadcast on Brazilian television in the country's history. The plot of A Cal√∫nia featured two staff members of an all-girls boarding school, played by Alves and Gomide, who become the subjects of rumors that they were gay. Alves plays the director of the school, while Gomide portrays her colleague. Upon hearing the rumors, outraged parents complain and the school is forced to closed. On the day the school closes, Alves and Gomide look at each other, kiss and realize they are actually in love. In a 2011 interview with √âpoca magazine, Alves called the landmark kiss \\"tender\\", since their characters had not realized their feelings for each other until that moment. In 1995, Alves and several television co-founded the Associa√ß√£o dos Pioneiros Profissionais e Incentivadores da Televis√£o Brasileira (Pr√≥-TV), a professional organization. She also operated the Museu da Televis√£o Brasileira, including special exhibitions, at her own home in S√£o Paulo for thirteen years. Alves released two books focusing on her career during her later life. A biography titled Vida Alves - Sem medo de viver, authored by Nelson Natalino, was published by Editora Imprensa Oficial in 2013. Alves also wrote a second book, Televis√£o brasileira: O primeiro beijo e outras curiosidades (Brazilian television: The first kiss and other curiosities), which she released in 2014. Alves was interviewed by BBC Brasil in December 2016, just weeks before her death. Alves began suffering from declining health in 2016. She was hospitalized in Sancta Maggiore hospital in S√£o Paulo on December 28, 2016, just weeks after her BBC Brasil interview. She died at the same hospital from multiple organ failure on January 3, 2017, at the age of 88. She was survived by two children, three grandchildren, including Brazilian singer Ti√™, and three great-grandchildren. Alves was buried in the Cemit√©rio do Ara√ß√° in S√£o Paulo.

Various mechanisms have been proposed to increase the size of the Earth's orbit. The most plausible method would involve redirecting asteroids or comets roughly about 100 km wide via gravity assists around the Earth's orbit and towards Jupiter or Saturn and back in order to gradually move the Earth away from the Sun in order to keep it within the continuously habitable zone. However, this scenario has many practical drawbacks: besides the fact that such a scenario spans vast timescales far longer than human history, it would also put life on Earth at risk, as the repeated encounters could cause the Earth to potentially lose its Moon, therefore severely disrupting Earth's climate and rotation. Additionally, the encounters would require said asteroids or comets to pass extremely dangerously close to Earth, and one slight miscalculation would end up causing the asteroid or comet to hit the Earth instead and potentially sterilizing it, at least down to the level of bacteria, and that the damage done cannot be overemphasized.

The Trust was established by the Government in September 1927. The Wellington Street Markets were formally opened on 14 June 1929 by the Deputy Premier of Western Australia, John Willcock. The site incorporated an auctioneering area (72,750 sq ft), meat markets (2,400 sq ft) and egg and poultry markets (9,900 sq ft). The site also included a public restaurant, post office and several bank branch offices. By the 1950s protective restrictions on road transport by the Road Transport Regulation Board were being lightened, and more trucking of produce into and away from the markets was beginning to have effect on Wellington Street. The closing down of various freight services on the Western Australian Government Railways system as it was changed to a bulk freight operation, and its new brand and style of operation, saw the location of the markets and proximity to the central business district and the high land values as a problem. Various reviews and changes to processes at the markets were occurring prior to the closure. In 1990, the Metropolitan Market Trust changed its name to the Perth Market Authority and in 1989 the Authority relocated the markets to a site in Canning Vale.

She is a four-time International Ribbon Tag Team Champion, while also being a former two-time ICE√ó‚àû Champion. Early life Sera was born in Sera, Hiroshima. After graduating high school, she moved to Tokyo and studied voice acting at Amusement Media Academy (AMG). In 2012, Sera took part in the audition for \\"Taiyo kara Plancha\\" (), a movie collaboration with Ice Ribbon, and she won the main role on the condition that she had to actually make her wrestling debut with other winners of the audition, which made Ice Ribbon's recruiting project likewise in \\"Muscle Venus.\\" Until then, she used her real name Risa Okuda. Professional wrestling career =Ice Ribbon (2012‚Äìpresent)= Sera in July 2016 Sera was trained by Tsukasa Fujimoto and Hikaru Shida and made her debut on November 10, 2012, at the Ice Ribbon dojo under the ring name Risa Sera, defeated by Hamuko Hoshi. A half of her co- actors quit wrestling early, but she, 235 and Rutsuko Yamaguchi (retired in 2014 due to knee injury) remained to be on the roster. On January 4, 2014, Sera teamed up with Maki Narumiya and named their tag team \\".STAP\\". They defeated Tsukushi and Kurumi at the Korakuen Hall event on March 30 to become the International Ribbon Tag Team Champions. Until the next year, they successfully retained the championship for nine times. The team was dissolved as Narumiya left Ice Ribbon by March 31, 2015. They were defeated in a hardcore tag match against Isami Kodaka and Yuko Miyamoto in their last match, then Sera challenged Narumiya to a hardcore tag match. They had the match on May 4 and Sera's team were defeated. Sera demanded an even harder rematch with light tubes, but this was declined by management of Ice Ribbon, because it would be deviating from the main concept of the promotion. Sera declared that she would boycott the next Korakuen Hall event on June 24, but eventually she held her own event there after Ice Ribbon's event for just one match called \\"Human Hair Death Match\\" () and made peace with Narumiya after being defeated again. Since then, Sera held two \\"Death Match\\" events collaborating with Ice Ribbon. They were made of fun matches by Ice Ribbon's wrestlers and really hardcore matches including ladders, barbed wires and light tubes by Sera, so practically she made the promotion compromise on the matter. On November 14, 2015, Sera formed a new tag team with Maya Yukihi, and named the team \\"Azure Revolution\\". On March 21, Sera challenged Hamuko Hoshi for the ICE Cross Infinity Championship, and defeated Hoshi by a diving double knee drop to win her first title as a single player. On May 3, Sera headlined Ice Ribbon's 10th anniversary event at Yokohama Cultural Gymnasium to successfully defend the championship against Yuka. Sera was defeated by Tsukasa Fujimoto at korakuen Hall event on July 3 and lost the title, but the title went vacant by the result of the November 3 event, and on December 31, Sera won the tournament for the championship, defeating Fujimoto in the finals, and regained the title.

It first became legal on 5 May 2017, when the Supreme Court of Bermuda declared that same-sex couples had a legal right to marry in the territory after a couple filed suit against the Bermudian Government. However, a bill to ban same-sex marriage and establish domestic partnerships was passed by the Parliament in December 2017 and went into effect on 1 June 2018 though same-sex marriages performed before that day remained legally recognised. In response to the renewed ban on same-sex marriage, two legal challenges were filed opposing the domestic partnership law. On 6 June 2018, the Supreme Court struck down the parts of the domestic partnership law that banned same-sex marriages but stayed the ruling while the government appealed to the Court of Appeal. It upheld the right of same-sex couples to marry when it handed down its ruling on 23 November 2018. Same-sex couples are free to marry in the territory while an appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is under way. History The Bermudian Government first made clear in 2004 that it would not consider the recognition of civil unions or same-sex marriages. In May 2006, MP Renee Webb tabled a private member's bill to add sexual orientation to the Human Rights Act 1981. The bill was squashed when the Parliament of Bermuda refused to discuss it. Socially, the situation was hard enough that some gay residents had chosen to emigrate, particularly to London, United Kingdom, where Bermudians and other British Overseas Territories citizens have a right to reside, to be able to live openly. One such emigrant noted that same-sex relationships had to essentially be secret, with partners introduced only as \\"friends\\" and relationships between two Bermudians as being very difficult. In June 2013, Parliament passed legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation under the human rights law. On 18 June 2013, newly-elected Premier Craig Cannonier ruled out same-sex marriage in Bermuda: \\"I can assure you that under my leadership this is not about same-sex marriage, and under my leadership that will not happen.\\" An amendment to Section 15 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1974, which required marriage to be between a man and a woman, was introduced to Parliament in 2016. The amendment would override the Human Rights Act 1981's anti- discrimination provisions on the basis of sexual orientation and retain language stating that marriage is limited to a man and a woman. On 8 July 2016, the House of Assembly passed the bill by 20 votes to 10. On 21 July 2016, the Senate rejected the legislation 5‚Äì6.Bermuda Senate narrowly rejects anti-marriage billSenate rejects Human Rights Act Amendment =Referendum (2016)= On 11 February 2016, Attorney General Trevor Moniz announced that the government would introduce a bill to create civil unions for same-sex couples. He ruled out the legalisation of same-sex marriage.Civil union legislation plans unveiled On 29 February 2016, it was announced that a referendum on both same-sex marriage and civil unions was planned.Bermuda plans referendum on same-sex marriage On 12 March, Premier Michael Dunkley announced that the referendum would take place mid-to-late June 2016. The results of the referendum would not be binding and were described by Dunkley as \\"only a way to get some clarity on the issue\\". Voters were asked two questions: \\"Are you in favour of same-sex marriage in Bermuda?\\" and \\"Are you in favour of same-sex civil unions in Bermuda?\\" Opposition Leader Marc Bean added that after the results of the referendum are announced, the government would govern accordingly. The non-binding referendum on same-sex unions was held in Bermuda on 23 June 2016.Bermuda same-sex marriage referendum set for June 23 Jamaica Observer, 12 May 2016Referendum (Same Sex Relationships) Act 2016 Bermuda Laws OnlineReferendum (Same Sex Relationships) Notice 2016 Bermuda Laws Online Both proposals were rejected by 60‚Äì70% of voters though the referendum was legally invalid, as less than 50% of eligible voters turned out. =Legal proceedings= A November 2015 ruling from the Supreme Court of Bermuda found that the same-sex partners of Bermuda residents should have the same rights to employment and benefits as all other spouses in Bermuda without restrictions from immigration requirements. The government did not indicate that it would appeal the decision; but it asked for implementation of the judgment to be suspended for an evaluation of the full scope of the judgment on such laws affecting \\"bankruptcy, estates, wills, succession rules, the right to inherit or receive bequests, health insurance legislation, pensions and social insurance\\". The ruling came into effect on 29 February 2016. In June 2016, after the referendum, two same-sex couples indicated they would apply for marriage licenses and hope for a court ruling to settle the issue. On 6 July 2016, a male same-sex couple filed notice of their intent to marry with an accompanying letter from their attorney requesting that the banns be posted within two days. The letter went on to state that unless the registrar notified the parties within two days, proceedings would be initiated in the Supreme Court of Bermuda. On 8 July 2016, the Registrar General's office rejected the application to publish banns for the same-sex couple that had applied for a license earlier in the week, which prompted their attorney to file a writ asking the Supreme Court to determine if the refusal contravened the provisions of the Human Rights Act. The case was heard by acting Chief Justice Charles-Etta Simmons of the Supreme Court on 1‚Äì3 February 2017. Supreme Court ruling (2017) Judge Charles-Etta Simmons issued her ruling in favour of same-sex marriage on 5 May 2017. Judge Simmons wrote that \\"on the facts, the applicants (Winston Godwin and his Canadian fianc√©, Greg DeRoche) were discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation when the Registrar refused to process their notice of intended marriage.... The applicants are entitled to an Order of Mandamus compelling the Registrar to act in accordance with the requirements of the Marriage Act 1944 and a declaration that same-sex couples are entitled to be married under the Marriage Act 1944.\\" The Rainbow Alliance issued a statement praising the ruling: \\"the ruling is a victory for all same-gender loving people in Bermuda [and] ensures that same-gender couples can enjoy the same legal protections as heterosexual spouses do\\". The group Preserve Marriage criticised the ruling as \\"an attack on traditional marriage [and] on Christian and other faith-based traditional values\\". Judge Simmons' ruling included a draft order giving effect to the judgement, but she heard from counsel on precise terms of the final order before giving it effect. The final order, which included a requirement on the part of the government to pay the petitioners' legal costs, was published on 22 September 2017. On 9 May 2017, Minister of Home Affairs Patricia Gordon-Pamplin said that the government would not appeal the ruling. The Registrar General posted the first wedding banns for a same-sex couple on 17 May, and the first same-sex marriage ceremony in Bermuda was celebrated on 31 May 2017. The ruling was welcomed by the operators of several cruise lines with Bermuda-flagged ships on which marriage ceremonies are performed under Bermuda law. The Preserve Marriage organisation, which intervened in the proceedings, and a separate group opposed to same-sex marriage sought to appeal the decision to the full bench of the Supreme Court, but leave to appeal was not granted. =Domestic Partnership Act 2018= After the July 2017 elections, which resulted in the Progressive Labour Party (PLP) returning a comfortable majority of MPs in the House of Assembly, PLP MP Wayne Furbert stated he would reintroduce a bill banning same-sex marriage to the Parliament in September and that he expected the bill to pass. Furbert stated the bill would need to be passed by only the Senate if it was amended. If it passed in its current form it would not need the approval of the Senate before being sent to the Governor for royal assent. The government stated that if Furbert's private member's bill passed the Parliament, it would draft a bill allowing same-sex couples rights equal to non-married heterosexual couples, akin to civil unions. After Furbert's announcement, several experts doubted the capacity of the bill to avoid Senate scrutiny, particularly if it was amended to make arrangements for existing same-sex marriages. On 2 November 2017, the newly-elected government introduced a bill to replace same-sex marriage with domestic partnerships. Two weeks of public consultation on the bill was held in various locations. The bill was strongly criticised by human rights groups, the Human Rights Commission and the Rainbow Alliance of Bermuda, which called it \\"an embarrassment\\" and \\"disappointing\\". The law would provide domestic partners with many of the same rights as married couples, particularly in areas such as pensions, inheritance, healthcare, tax, and immigration. The bill was debated in the House of Assembly and passed by a 24‚Äì10 vote on 8 December 2017. It then passed the Senate by an 8‚Äì3 vote on 13 December 2017. The provision of royal assent, usually a formality, was debated in the British Parliament and the subject of a lengthy review by Her Majesty's Government and the Governor of Bermuda. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson received calls to withhold his approval of the bill, as territorial governors may refuse to assent certain bills but require the approval of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to do so.Boris Johnson under fire for allowing ban on same-sex marriage Eventually, on 7 February 2018, the Governor provided assent to the bill, allowing the law to go into effect on a day to be appointed by the Minister of Home Affairs.Domestic Partnership Act 2018 (refer to p. 31 for note on commencement) A number of international politicians and human rights organisations criticised the change and argued that the move would ultimately damage the island's tourist industry.Gay MP says Bermuda's ban on same-sex marriage will damage Britain's reputation Same-sex marriages performed before the law commenced would remain recognised under the new law.Bermuda trades same-sex marriage for domestic partnerships The Bermudian Tourism Authority expressed fears and concerns that Bermuda would experience an economic fallout if the law went into effect.Bermuda repeals same-sex marriage Bermuda's repeal of same-sex marriage received significant and considerable international media coverage.International Media Report On Marriage Law Bernews, 8 February 2018 The Guardian and The New York Times reported that \\"Bermuda had become the first country to repeal same-sex marriage\\".Bermuda becomes first nation to legalize gay marriage, then repeal it The New York Times, 8 February 2018 The repeal was met with calls for a boycott. #BoycottBermuda quickly began trending on Twitter and other social media outlets.'Truly evil': Calls to boycott Bermuda for unprecedented repeal of same-sex marriage In response, LGBT groups proposed challenging the new law in court, as it \\"removes an established fundamental human right\\". Lawyer Mark Pettingill, who successfully argued before the Supreme Court in 2017 that same-sex marriage was a human right, said that any further legal action would need to be heard in higher, namely European, courts.Pettingill says battle may be far from over On 28 February 2018, the Minister of Home Affairs, Walter Roban, announced that the Domestic Partnership Act 2018 would take effect on 1 June 2018. Same-sex couples who wished to marry before that date had to apply for a marriage licence by 12 May. The Commencement Notice was issued on 9 April 2018. Legal challenges A challenge against the law was filed with the Supreme Court on 16 February 2018. A second lawsuit against the law was announced on 3 April 2018. A hearing was held on 21 and 22 May 2018 before the Chief Justice of the court. The court ruled on the matter on 6 June 2018, revoking the parts of the law that prevented same-sex couples from marrying and held that \\"maintaining or restoring a definition of marriage that disadvantaged those who believe in same-sex marriage discriminated against them on the grounds of their creed contrary to section 12 of the Bermuda Constitution\\". The court agreed to an application by the Attorney-General to stay the ruling by six weeks to allow the government to consider an appeal. On 5 July, the Minister of Home Affairs, Walter Roban, confirmed that an appeal had been filed with the Court of Appeal. The court heard oral arguments on 7, 8 and 9 November 2018. On 23 November, the court upheld the Supreme Court's ruling and refused to stay the decision. On 13 December 2018, Roban announced that the government had applied to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal the ruling to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. On 29 May 2019, Roban said that permission to appeal had been granted. The government filed the notice of appeal on 12 July 2019. The appeal will be heard on 3‚Äì4 February 2021. A March 2019 estimate showed that the court cases surrounding same-sex marriage had cost US$120,000-150,000. However, a May 2019 estimate by association OutBermuda suggested that the total cost of the court cases is likely to cost taxpayers as much as US$3 million. =Statistics= Between May 2017 and June 2018, 20 same-sex couples married in Bermuda, of which 14 on the island itself and 6 on board Bermudian-registered ships. By May 2019, there had been two more same-sex marriages since the Court of Appeal's judgment in November 2018. By May 2019, three couples had entered into domestic partnerships. Public opinion An opinion poll in July 2010 showed 27% of respondents in favour of same-sex marriage and 51% against. An October 2015 poll by Global Research commissioned by The Royal Gazette found that 48% of Bermudians supported same-sex marriage and that 44% opposed it.Poll: support for same-sex marriage An August 2020 opinion poll conducted by Global Research showed that 53% of Bermudians supported same-sex marriage. Support was higher among 18‚Äì34-year-olds at 64%. 95% of respondents felt that the legalisation of same-sex marriage had not negatively affected them, and 75% opposed the government spending more money on the issue in court.

He was the nephew of James Blair, the founder of the College of William and Mary, and father of John Blair, Jr., a delegate to the Constitutional Convention and associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. Early life Blair was born in Scotland around 1687, the only known son of Archibald Blair, and immigrated as a child with his family to Virginia in the 1690s. Archibald was a brother of James Blair, the founder of the College of William and Mary in Williamsbury. Archibald operated an apothecary shop in Williamsburg. John Blair graduated from the College of William and Mary around 1707 and remained in Williamsburg his whole life. Public career Blair's public career may have begun in 1715, when he or a cousin with the same name was appointed keeper of the Royal Storehouse in Williamsburg. Blair took the oaths of office as a justice of the peace for York County on August 17, 1724 (serving until he was sworn in as a member of the Virginia Governor's Council in 1745) and in 1727 as a James River upper district naval officer (serving until he became deputy Auditor General of Virginia on August 15, 1728). He served as deputy Auditor General until his death in 1771, while simultaneously holding various other positions. Blair was elected to the House of Burgesses from Jamestown from 1734 to 1736, succeeding his father. Subsequently, he was then elected to represent Williamsburg from 1736 to 1740 where he dealt with issues of the defense of colonists from attacks by Indians. From April 22, 1741 to October 15, 1741, he served as clerk of the Governor's Council. During part of that time, his uncle James Blair was the acting governor. He is likely the John Blair who was Williamsburg's mayor in 1751. Blair having inherited approximately ¬£10,000 from his uncle James, Governor William Gooch now considered him qualified for a seat on the upper house of the colonial legislature, the Virginia Governor's Council and recommended to the king in February 1745 that he be appointed to fill a vacant seat. However, the king had already named Blair to fill a different vacancy on November 15, 1744. He was seated on August 6, 1745. He became the council's senior member or president in 1757 and served four times as Virginia's acting governor. The first was after the departure of Robert Dinwiddie, from January 12, 1758 to June 5, 1758, when Francis Fauquier arrived. The second time was in September and October 1761 when Fauquier was consulting with General Jeffery Amherst in New York. In 1763, Blair was acting governor when Fauquier was in the Province of Georgia in September to December. The final time was after Fauquier's death on March 4, 1768 until the arrival of his replacement, Norborne Berkeley on October 26, 1768. Although appointed for life, he resigned on October 15, 1770 after the death of governor Berkeley. In poor health himself, he did not want to serve as acting governor again for the fifth time. He died the following year. Blair having a large family to support, the Council petitioned the king to grant Blair a pension. The king and Privy Council did not act before Blair's death. =Deputy Auditor General= Holding the position for 43 years, he was responsible for certifying the accuracy of official government revenue accounts, including quitrents and taxes on exported tobacco, then a major component of Virginia's agricultural production. Blair successfully improved procedures and records to prevent the evasion of paying quitrents. However, in his final years the efficacy of the office was poor, probably due to his failing health and the death of his assistant. Blair's son became the next deputy auditor general. =Governor's Council= In 1746, he voted to license Reverend Samuel Davies to preach in Williamsburg, one of the first non- Anglican ministers licensed in Virginia. This was not popular with the established church as Davies advanced the cause of religious and civil liberty and preached to religious dissenters against the Anglican Church. =Governor= During his first term as acting governor in 1758, he addressed the General Assembly on March 31 requesting that Virginia raise an additional regiment for offensive operations in the Ohio Valley against the New France forces in the French and Indian War, which was approved. Also approved was the issuance of ¬£32,000 of treasury notes to fund defenses of the colony. In 1768, Fauquier had intended to call the Assembly into session. After Fauquier died, Blair, again acting Governor, followed through with a session that closed in April at which time he sent to the king and Parliament the assembly's challenges, led by speaker Peyton Randolph of Parliament's right to tax the colonies. The response was the speedy appointment of Berkeley as new governor with instructions to quash such protests of the crown's authority over the colonies. Blair also urged Virginia's clergy to raise money to aid the victims of a fire in Old Montreal (then under British rule) that destroyed the Congregation Notre-Dame convent and 88 houses. =Other civic action= Blair served on a 1745 committee to revise the laws of Virginia, on a committee that oversaw the 1748‚Äì1753 rebuilding of the Capitol after it burned in 1747, and on another in 1763 to correspond with Virginia's London agent. He was appointed to the Board of Trustees of the public hospital for lunatics established in 1769. Blair was the only participant in the bricklaying ceremonies for both of the Williamsburg Capitol buildings (in 1699 or 1701 and 1752 or 1754). Religious duty Blair served as a vestryman of Bruton Parish, from around 1744 or earlier, and was a churchwarden about 1749. He was also a visitor of the College of William and Mary in 1758. Williamsburg business interests Until his death in 1733, Blair's father, Archibald, was the largest shareholder of Dr. Blair's Store, a mercantile house. Blair was the store's manager. Blair was also a partner with John Blair Jr. (the son of a cousin) in another store from 1740 to 1759. Blair owned one the largest taverns in the colony, the Raleigh Tavern, named after Sir Walter Raleigh and the Chowning Tavern, renting them to tavern keepers. He owned Chowning from 1726 to around 1738, and sold Raleigh in 1742. In 1745, he was a partner with 16 others in a land grant on the Potomac and Youghiogheny rivers. Personal Blair married his first cousin Mary Munro about 1726. Munro, the daughter of the Reverend John and Christina Monro of St. John's Parish, King William County, was born circa 1708 and died 1768 They had ten children, including eight daughters. Their fourth child, John Blair, Jr. became an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. One daughter was named Agan (Scottish for Anna), who married Colonel John Banister. She was born in 1746 and died in 1813. Another daughter, Mary (Born September 27, 1734), married on December 6, 1753 Colonel George Braxton who died October 3, 1761, and on December 31, 1774 Colonel R. Burwell who died January 30, 1777, and lastly on June 2, 1795 to Mr. R Prescott who died June 2, 1795. A third daughter was Elizabeth (Betsy), who married Captain/Commander/Admiral Thompson. A fourth daughter, Christian (1727‚Äì1784), married Armistead Burwell who was elected Burgess in 1753‚Äì1754. His son Dr. James Blair married in 1771 and shortly thereafter separated from his wife and died the next year. This led to a dower lawsuit between his estate and wife (Blair v Blair), involving his brother John as executor and Thomas Jefferson and Edmund Randolph as council. Some considered this matter a scandal. John Blair Sr. died in Williamsburg on November 5, 1771 and was buried in Bruton Parish churchyard. Blair and his family likely lived in the John Blair House, presently located on Duke of Gloucester Street in the National Register of Historic Places district living history museum of Colonial Williamsburg. The house was originally built in the mid 18th century (1747) and is one of the oldest in Williamsburg. The house features typical American colonial architecture, including hip roof dormers. The stone steps were imported from England. The house was reconstructed in 1937. According to Blair's diary, he loved gardening and maintained a garden with flowers, vegetables, and a fruit tree orchard.

orchestral composition by the Romanian composer George Enescu, left incomplete at the composer's death, but finished in 1996 by Pascal Bentoiu. History Enescu began sketching his Fourth Symphony in 1928, but did not return to it in earnest until after completing the orchestration of his opera ≈ídipe in 1931. Although he worked on the symphony from 1932, he broke off work in December 1934 after achieving a complete draft and a partial orchestration. He briefly resumed work in the spring of 1939, but it remained incomplete at his death (; ). Enescu made two orchestrated drafts of the first movement. The first is undated, while the second one, dated 20 October (or possibly 20 December according to ) 1934, also continues the orchestration into the second movement, extending through about the first quarter of it. After having completed Enescu's Fifth Symphony in 1995, Pascal Bentoiu undertook completion of the Fourth as well, and this version was premiered in Bucharest on 2 October 1997 by conducting the George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra . The UK premiere was given in London on 29 April 2017 by Samuel Draper conducting the Oberon Symphony Orchestra . Analysis The symphony has three movements, which are played without pauses in between: *Allegro apassionato *Un poco andante, marziale *Allegro vivace ‚Äì non troppo The first movement is in sonata-allegro form, with the exposition presenting the exceptionally economical matter (only five or six melodic elements) that will account for virtually all of the music in the symphony. The main cyclic theme, which will recur in each movement at the same pitch and in the same instrument, first appears in the trumpet at rehearsal number 21. The development section is comparatively short, but this will be compensated by further extensive development in the finale. The recapitulation brings back the two main themes in reverse order. The second theme, originally presented in the solo flute, returns in a blaze of orchestral colour, while the first theme group is represented mainly by what was originally a bridge idea . This first movement, although completed by Enescu, cannot be regarded on its own, nor did the composer conceive it as such. Even in its unfinished form, the second movement (Un poco andante, marziale) follows without interruption and represents, in its thematic character, a continuation of the initial movement . The second movement develops further both of the theme groups from the first movement, in a march character that builds steadily to a climax at rehearsal number 49 and then subsides to a whisper in a solo string quartet, specified by the composer in the short-score sketch. The movement ends inconclusively, with a tremolo in the strings, cymbals, and harp that leads directly into the finale . The finale is difficult to assign to a definite form. Although there are passages with expository and developmental aspects, its overall function is the recapitulation of all the material from the previous two movements. After a certain point, Enescu turns his attention to breaking up the rhythms within the metre, first into twos, then fours, fives, nines, and tens, as well as superimposing them until finally the underlying ternary rhythm is broken and transformed into a binary metre .

H√§meensilta is one of the city's best known landmarks, especially famous for the statues on the rails of the bridge. The arches of the bridge are made of concrete and they are coated with a red granite. The H√§meensilta was completed in 1929. It is named after the Finnish name of the Tavastia province.  History  The first known bridge crossing the Tammerkoski was built in the 16th century as the area was a part of the Messukyl√§ socken. As the town of Tampere was established in 1779, the wooden bridge was finally replaced with a steel structured in 1884. During the early 1900s, Tampere was rapidly growing and the present H√§meensilta was built in 1928‚Äì1929.

She attended the local school and relocated to Brisbane in 1920 to join the Queensland Public Service, working as private secretary to the under- secretaries of the Department of Labour Industry. Personal life and career King married solicitor Edward Francis Pender on 5 August 1939 at the All Saints Church in Wickham Terrace. She became secretary of the local chapter of the Australian Comforts Fund's Queensland division. In 1941, her husband enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force; a year later, King was appointed as the administrative officer of the Australian Women's Land Army (AWLA) in Queensland. The couple filed for divorce some five years later. The AWLA worked to mobilise female workers to replace male workers who had left to fight during the war. McLeish was instrumental in recruiting women, and in overcoming the skepticism of some farmers who were uneasy with having women replace their male workers.

As a three-year-old, he won the 142nd running of the New Zealand Derby, followed up by a win in the Rosehill Guineas in Australia. At age four, he won the Windsor Park Plate and was second in the Livamol Classic, but then was injured while warming up for the Emirates Stakes. The injury required surgery that eventually prompted his retirement. Background Gingernuts is a chestnut gelding who was bred by Goodwood Stud in Palmerston North. He was produced by Double Elle, a five-time winning daughter of Generous who descends on the female side from New Zealand Oaks winner Devante. Gingernuts was sired by Iffraaj, a stakes-winning son of Zafonic. He was sold as a weanling for only NZ$5000, then was put through the ring again in the 2015 Ready to Run Sale of two-year-olds. He was bought for NZ$42,500 by Te Akau Racing, a 35 member syndicate consisting of mostly first time owners. He is trained by Steven Autridge and Jamie Richards. Racing career Gingernuts made his debut on 6 May 2016 in a 1200m maiden race at Pukekohe Park, finishing second. He then broke his maiden on 19 May at Hastings over a distance of 1300m. Gingernuts began his three-year-old campaign on a low-key note, winning one of three starts while competing at rural tracks such as Te Teko. Early in 2017, his trainers added blinkers to his equipment, which helped him focus. On 18 February, he dramatically stepped up in class in class for the Group II Avondale Guineas at Ellerslie, going off at odds of 26-to-one. Gingernuts missed the start by six lengths and still appeared to have no chance with 600m remaining. However, he then found racing room and \\"sailed through\\" to win by a length. The win prompted his connections to make a late nomination payment for the New Zealand Derby. Gingernuts was the second favourite for the 2017 New Zealand Derby on 4 March. Ridden by Opie Bosson, who had previously won several major races aboard Mongolian Khan, the chestnut gelding surged out of midfield to score a comfortable victory. The win sparked jubilant scenes among the owners, most wearing matching orange caps. \\"We didn't know where we were before the Avondale Guineas\\", said Richards. \\"There's a lot of excited owners here.\\" Two weeks after his Derby win, Gingernuts crossed the Tasman to make his Australian debut in the Rosehill Guineas at a distance of 2000m. Over extremely heavy going, he settled in mid-pack, then unleashed his run with 800m remaining and struck the lead shortly after turning into the straight. He tired somewhat in the final 100m but was still over three lengths clear of the runner-up, Inference. \\"He just loves it the further they go and we knew he would handle the conditions,\\" said Richards. \\"He had his ears pricked all the way up the straight and he was gawking and looking around,\\" noted Bosson. \\"I was just trying to keep his mind on the job.\\" He finished his three-year-old campaign with a fifth place finish in the Australian Derby. Gingernuts returned to New Zealand and was given some time off, then began his four-year- old campaign on 2 September in the Tarzino Trophy, finishing fifth. He next entered the Windsor Park Plate on 23 September, in which his odds dropped rapidly to 2.90 thanks to his ever-growing fanbase. He raced in mid-pack during the early running then followed Kawi to the lead with about 600m remaining. Gingernuts dueled briefly with Kawi before pulling away, then withstood a late charge from Close Up to win by a neck. Two weeks later though, he was caught at the finish line by Wait A Sec in the Livamol Spring Classic, losing by a head. Gingernuts made his second trip to Australia for the Emirates Stakes on 11 November. Unfortunately, he took a bad step during the warm-up and was immediately pulled up by jockey Michael Dee. The on-track veterinarian immediately applied bandages and the horse was transported to the University of Melbourne veterinary clinic at Werribee. A CT scan found a fracture of the long pastern bone on his near foreleg. He underwent surgery on 13 November, during which four compression screws were inserted into the leg. A small fragment of bone was also removed from the fetlock joint. The initial prognosis was positive according to David Ellis of Te Akau Racing. \\"The fracture came together well,\\" he said, \\"and barring any further complications, the prognosis is that he stands a 50/50 chance for a return to racing.\\" Retirement On 2 September 2018, his connections announced that Gingernuts was officially retired. Although he recovered well from his injury, veterinarians feared that he would favour the injured leg if he returned to racing. He has been pensioned at Te Akau Stud.

Drafted in 1941 and partially orchestrated at some later date, the symphony was left unfinished at Enescu's death, but has been completed posthumously, first partially by in 1970‚Äì72 and 1990, then in complete form by Pascal Bentoiu in 1995. History Lumini»ô, Enescu's villa near Sinaia, where he composed the Fifth Symphony Although the ideas in it had doubtless been gestating for some time, Enescu began writing the Fifth Symphony during his annual summer break at his villa, Lumini»ô, in Sinaia in 1941, completing the entire draft in a span of something less than one month. The starting date is unknown, but Enescu might have been prompted to begin the symphony by the outbreak of war in Romania on 22 June. The first movement is dated 1 July in the manuscript and the second movement 8 July. The third movement is undated, but the fourth and final movement of the draft was completed on 19 July. For reasons that are not entirely clear, but must have had something to do with the war, Enescu broke off work at this point . At some later date (perhaps in Romania before September 1946, or later, in Paris), Enescu set about the orchestration, completing twenty-five pages (about two-thirds) of the first movement, up to a culminating chord in the fifth bar of the recapitulation . The first movement of the Symphony, in the completion by Cornel »öƒÉranu, was premiered at the Cluj Musical Autumn in 1972 under the baton of Emil Simon. Encouraged by its reception, »öƒÉranu set about the more difficult task of completing the rest . After finishing a piano-score version, he orchestrated the finale, which was first presented together with the first movement at the Enescu Festival of 1991 in Bucharest, performed by the George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra under . Although »öƒÉranu had hoped to complete the orchestration of the other two movements as well, he was prevented from doing so and asked Pascal Bentoiu to undertake the task. Realizing that the orchestrational integrity of the whole would otherwise suffer, Bentoiu (with »öƒÉranu's agreement) reworked the entire finale as well as the unfinished third of the first movement, and the completed symphony was finally premiered in Bucharest by the Romanian National Orchestra and Radio Choir, with Florin Diaconescu, tenor soloist, conducted by , on the opening concert of the 1996‚Äì97 season . Analysis The symphony has four movements: *Moderato sciolto *Andantino moderato piacevole *Vivace con fuoco *Andante grave The overall form of the symphony involves, typically for Enescu, a cyclical metamorphosis of thematic \\"characters\\", setting out from a definitively shaped but spontaneous block of sonorities . It involves a broadening of the concept of clyclic form, however, in that the allocation of roles for the various themes is constantly changing, in a sort of perpetual variational thinking. The main theme of the first movement, for example, will become a secondary theme in the finale. Similarly, the internal arrangement of elements within each theme group also changes with every recurrence . The first movement (Moderato sciolto) is written in a free sonata-allegro form . The first thematic group is striking for the breadth of its melodic content, which is not usual for any symphony, and is not found in Enescu's previous four essays in the form. Within the composer's catalogue, it is necessary to go back to the String Octet (1900) or the \\"Pr√©lude a l'unison\\" from the Second Orchestral Suite (1915) to find a comparable treatment. This theme group extends for twelve pages of orchestral score, up until the solo violin enters at rehearsal-number 7, marked dolente. At first this seems to be just a bridge, but proves to be the most important element of the second thematic group. This second group, in contrast to the first, presents a small number of well-defined motifs and phrases, and continues for only four pages of score, to the beginning of the development section at rehearsal number 11 . The treatment of the exposition materials is one of \\"characters in the making\\"‚Äîfigures and motives that will evolve over the remainder of the entire symphony . The tumultuous development section reaches its climax after five bars of the recapitulation are already under way. It is at this point that Enescu's completed orchestration ceases, and what follows is surpisingly compressed, reaching the second thematic group after only sixteen bars. The composer's intention seems to have been to create in the first movement only a summary of what is to follow in the rest of the symphony, with anticipations in place of the expected resolutions. The movement concludes with an announcement of a new theme, which will become the opening theme of the second movement, at exactly the same pitch‚Äîa device that Enescu used frequently, ever since the Octet and the First Orchestral Suite. He will do exactly the same thing at the junction of the third and fourth movements . The second movement (Andantino moderato piacevole) is in Enescu's mature rhapsodic style. It opens with a long viola solo, recalling the modal sound world of the composer's nearly contemporaneous Opp. 27 and 28: the Third Orchestral Suite (Villageoise) and the Impressions d'enfance for violin and piano. After a repetition by the oboe, accompanied by other woodwinds, the viola returns, accompanied in an improvisational, lƒÉutƒÉreascƒÉ style. (The scoring here is indicated scrupulously by the composer in the draft score.) The chromatic/neoromantic musical language gives way here to a fluid modal world that passes easily from one finalis to another, with accompanying pedals, shifting isons, quartal-quintal chords and secundal harmonies, as well as locally \\"displaced\\" chords . Structurally, the movement is extremely free, beginning with a series of thematic expositions in an A B A' B' C D sequence, then continuing from rehearsal 32 with only the material already presented up to that point. Although recapitulation is occasionally suggested, the only real recapitulation occurs with the return of the solo viola's unmistakably Romanian theme three bars after rehearsal number 46 . The third movement (Vivace con fuoco) is a scherzo, written in 2/2 time with an inner pulsation of triplets. The thematic material is drawn entirely from the first movement, especially from the second part of the first thematic group. After a dense opening passage, the texture gradually thins out, eventually giving way to a sort of chorale (taking the place of the conventional trio section), though with continuing bursts from the first theme. This central section closes in a \\"triumphal\\" quality, with suggestions of the secondary thematic group from the first movement. This scherzo is the only real allegro movement of the symphony and may be regarded as a redevelopment of the material from the first movement, along the lines of Arnold Schoenberg's procedure in his First Chamber Symphony . The movement is extremely modulatory. At rehearsal number 65, the theme from the first movement's second group, originally dolente in the solo violin, now enters forcefully, and the momentum is broken. Four bars after rehearsal 68, the movement closes with two statements of the subject that will launch the finale . The finale (Andante grave) is an extended cantata for tenor solo, female choir, and orchestra, using as text an early variant of the poem \\"Mai am un singur dor\\" (I Have but One Desire) by Mihai Eminescu. Its overall form, in outline, is : *Fugato ‚Äì stretto ‚Äì pedal *Recapitulative development of material from all the preceding movements *Cantata ‚Äì final coda The subject of the opening fugato is derived from that dolente theme from the solo violin in the first movement. Here it is assigned (by the composer himself in the sketch) to the brass. The effect is funereal (in his edition, Bentoiu has taken the liberty of adding to the tempo marking, in brackets, \\"Quasi marcia funebre\\"), implacable, rigid, and magnificent. The section comes to an end with the main theme from the second movement, \\"almost as if we were invited to read a name on a wooden cross\\" . Text Mihai Eminescu in 1884 The text used in the last movement of the symphony does not quite correspond to any of the four \\"official\\" versions of Eminescu's poem, but is based on an early variant beginning with the words \\"De-oi adormi cur√¢nd / √én noaptea uitƒÉrii / SƒÉ mƒÉ duce≈£i tƒÉc√¢nd, / La marginea mƒÉrii\\" (When soon I'm laid to rest / in the quiet evening / bring me silently / to the seashore). Eminescu's variant has nine stanzas, but for the symphony, Enescu has added an extra one in the penultimate position. It is taken from the final version, but with the last two lines exchanged in order to match the abab rhyme scheme of the earlier variant: \\"Luceferi ce rƒÉsar / Din umbrƒÉ de cetini / O sƒÉ-mi z√¢mbeascƒÉ iar / Fiindu-mi prieteni\\" (Rising evening stars / from the shadow of the branches / will smile on me again / having been my friends) (; ).

Taxonomy and systematics The broad-billed roller was originally described in the genus Coracias. Formerly, some authorities have considered the broad-billed roller to have been a subspecies of the oriental dollarbird. Alternate names for the broad-billed roller include the African broad-billed roller and cinnamon roller. =Subspecies= Four subspecies are recognized: * E. g. aethiopicus Neumann, 1905, the Nile Valley broad-billed roller or Abyssinian broad-billed roller is found in Ethiopia * E. g. afer (Latham, 1790), originally described as a separate species in the genus Coracias, is found from Senegambia to northern Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan * E. g. suahelicus Neumann, 1905, the East African broad- billed roller, is found in from Somalia to Uganda, northern Zambia, Angola, Mozambique and north-eastern South Africa * E. g. glaucurus (Statius Muller, 1776), the Madagascar roller or Madagascar broad-billed roller, breeds in Madagascar but ranges to mainland Africa in winter Description The broad- billed roller is 29‚Äì30 cm in length. It has a warm back and head, lilac foreneck and breast, with the rest of the plumage mainly brown. The broad bill is bright yellow. Sexes are similar, but the juvenile is a drabber version of the adult, with a pale breast. The broad-billed roller is striking in its strong direct flight, with the brilliant blues of the wings and tail contrasting with the brown back. The call of the broad-billed roller is a snarling k-k-k-k-k-r-r-r-r-r sound. Distribution and habitat This is a species of open woodland with some tall trees, preferably near water. These rollers often perch prominently on trees, posts or overhead wires, like giant shrikes. Behaviour and ecology They are inactive for most of the day, apart from chasing intruders, but in late afternoon they hunt for the swarming ants and termites on which they feed, sometimes in groups of 100 or more rollers. They drink like swallows, dipping their bills into water in flight. This bird nests in an unlined hole in a tree cavity, laying 2-3 eggs.

Michael Palin played in this film just as he was establishing his post-Monty Python career, and the film has \\"glints of Python-like silliness throughout\\".  Plot  The film is narrated in first-person by Curry playing Jerome. Although the film follows the book's plot faithfully, it ends with an epilogue about the real-world events that shaped it. The narrator talks about the book's original appearance in Home Chimes and the excision of the serious travelogue parts by the magazine's editor.

The Phoenix was founded by impresario Norris Houghton and T. Edward Hambleton. The project was a pioneering effort in the establishment of off-Broadway theatre. Houghton and Hambleton wanted a theatre away from Times Square, that would host a permanent company, abjure the star system (players would be listed alphabetically), produce four or five plays a season for limited engagements (contributors would be asked to sponsor an entire season rather than individual productions), and with ticket prices much lower than on Broadway. This building housed the Phoenix Theatre, 1953‚Äì1961 The Phoenix Theatre was established in a building at East 12th Street and Second Avenue in the East Village, far from Broadway. The building, opened in 1926, had formerly housed the Yiddish Art Theatre, and is now the Village East Cinema. The Phoenix opened on December 1, 1953, with a production of Madam Will You Walk?, Sidney Howard's last play, starring Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy, followed by productions of Coriolanus and The Golden Apple (which then moved to Broadway, at the Alvin Theater). The opening season concluded with The Seagull, starring Montgomery Clift, and directed by Houghton himself. The Phoenix Theatre's opening season was judged successful. In the following seasons the theater mounted many more productions featuring notable figures of the theatre, and garnered various awards. Associated persons included British actors Pamela Brown, Michael and Rachel Redgrave, Peggy Ashcroft; American stars Hume Cronyn, Jessica Tandy, Millie Natwick, Mildred Dunnock, Robert Ryan, Montgomery Clift, and Kaye Ballard; and directors and producers Elia Kazan, John Houseman, Robert Whitehead, and Alfred de Liagre; and writers and designers Sidney Howard, Robert Sherwood, John Latouche, Jerome Moross, Donald Oenslager, and Jean Eckart. Productions mounted over the span of the Phoenix Theatre's existence include The Doctor's Dilemma (George Bernard Shaw), The Master Builder (Henrik Ibsen), Story of a Soldier (music drama, Igor Stravinsky), Six Characters in Search of an Author (Luigi Pirandello), The Mother of Us All (opera, Virgil Thomson and Gertrude Stein), Measure for Measure (William Shakespeare), Livin' the Life (musical based on Mark Twain's Mississippi River tales), The Good Woman of Szechuan (Bertolt Brecht), The Taming of the Shrew (William Shakespeare), and Anna Christie (Eugene O'Neill). Houghton, frustrated by the role of theatrical producer because it precluded him from directing, left the Phoenix to become a professor at Vassar College, beginning in 1959 and completely disengaging from the Phoenix within a few years. T. Edward Hambleton continued to run the Phoenix for the remainder of its existence. In 1961 the Phoenix, financially troubled, moved to a new and smaller house (300 seats) at 334 East 74th Street and ceased being a repertory company. The first production at the new site was Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad. But two years later the Phoenix merged with Ellis Rabb's company, the Association of Producing Artists (APA), and again took up being a repertory company. The company was then called the APA-Phoenix Theatre (or APA-Phoenix Repertory Company). In 1966, the APA- Phoenix moved to the Lyceum Theatre, in the heart of the Broadway district near Times Square, and remained there until 1969. In 1969 the association with the APA ended, and the Phoenix became peripatetic, staging shows at various venues including the ANTA Washington Square Theatre, the Sheridan Square Playhouse, the 48th Street Playhouse, the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, and the Marymount Manhattan Theatre. In 1972, the Phoenix Theatre In 1982, the Phoenix Theatre moved to a new home in the basement theatre at St. Peter's Evangelical Lutheran Church, which sits under the Citigroup Center at 619 Lexington Avenue at 54th Street. The opening production was Michael Hastings' Two Fish in the Sky. The Phoenix Theatre celebrated its new home, its new season, and its 30th anniversary with a gala soir√©e. But Two Fish in the Sky was panned and flopped, and hoped-for corporate support was not forthcoming. Citing insuperable financial challenges, the Phoenix announced on December 13, 1982, that it was ceasing operations. That venue is used since 1993 by York Theatre.

The plot of the game is that the boss of the new virtual reality video game \\"Wild Side\\" begins abducting players and the main character, Casey, goes to beat it and rescue them. He does this by using masks to shapeshift into different characters in order to use different abilities. It was later released in Japan as . After its initial release in 1992 for the Genesis, it was later re-released a number of times in the 2000s, including part of the Sega Smash Pack 2 for the PC in 2000, the Sega Genesis Collection for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 2 in 2006, as a digital release on the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2009 and for the Sega Forever service in 2017. Gameplay The player, as Kid Chameleon, progresses through a series of levels, containing an array of deadly enemies and obstacles. Most levels contain a flag, which is the primary goal of each level, from which the player progresses to the next level. However, a number of teleporters throughout the game can warp the player not only to different places in the same level, but also to different levels, and sometimes to an entirely different path through the game. At the end of the game, Kid fights and defeats the final boss, Heady Metal. Kid Chameleon contains 103 levels, of which only about half are on the \\"main path\\" (traversing levels only by flags), and also counts 32 smaller unnamed levels, simply called \\"Elsewhere\\". Despite the game's considerable length, there was no password system or other method of saving the game (although re-releases in compilations and the Virtual Console include their own save features). There are several bonuses that can be earned at the end of certain levels (in which the flag is touched), including beating a time limit, not getting hit and not collecting any prizes. As Kid Chameleon moves through the game's levels, he gains access to masks that alter him into different characters. Each character has different special abilities and varying numbers of hit points. Collecting a mask that the player is already wearing will restore its health. The sheer amount of variety in gameplay due to the various characters is part of what gave Kid Chameleon such an addictive style; few levels repeated the same structure and they usually had specific strategies and characters to be beaten. In addition to the offensive abilities of each form, the Kid could also defeat enemies by jumping on them, although he may take damage from some enemies by doing so. Each form can also make use of Diamond Powers which require diamonds collected in the game to use, accessed by pressing A + Start. Players lose a life if Kid Chameleon loses all his hit points in human form, is crushed, falls into bottomless pits or lava, touches the drill wall which appears in certain levels, or if time runs out. Extra lives and continues can be found in the game, with additional lives awarded for every 50,000 points.

He took part in the Fourth Crusade (1202‚Äì04) and in the founding of the Latin Empire. A younger son of Garnier I, lord of Pont- sur-Seine and Tra√Ænel, Garnier was very old when he became a bishop. His uncle, Philippe de Pont, had previously been bishop of Troyes from 1083 to 1121, and his older brother, Ponce II, is recorded in a document from 1104. First pilgrimage In 1197, Garnier set out to visit the Holy Land in fulfillment of a vow. One of the purposes of his journey was to settle some disputes troubling the church of Troyes through the intervention of Count Henry II of Champagne, then ruling the Kingdom of Jerusalem in right of his wife, Queen Isabella I. He got only so far as Piacenza when news reached him of the death of Henry on 10 September. In light of his vow he continued his journey into Tuscany, but there was met by some friends returning from the Holy Land, who informed him that the French were all leaving and that Jerusalem was dominated by the Germans who had just come over. After receiving permission from Pope Innocent III to fulfill his vow with a cash payment for the defence of the Holy Land, Garnier returned to Champagne. In a surviving letter, Innocent praises Garnier for his undertaking in light of his age: \\"Not the disadvantage of imminent old age, nor the danger of the route, neither the doubtful fealty and constant inconstancy of the sea have deterred [you].\\" Fourth Crusade Garnier took a second vow to go to the Holy Land in 1199. He was with the crusader army that massed in Venice in 1202, and he accompanied it to the Siege of Zara (1202), thence to Corfu (1203) and finally the Sack of Constantinople (1204). He and the other clergy functioned as the conscience of the army, and they absolved the crusaders of wrongdoing for the sieges of Zara and Constantinople. Geoffrey of Villehardouin explicitly names the bishop of Troyes (li vesque de Troie) as among the clergy declaring the war to be just and right (droituriere). Garnier appears to have been among the most trusted men in the crusader army. Early in 1204, Henry of Flanders defeated the Emperor Alexios V Mourtzouphlos in battle and captured an important icon that the imperial forces had been carrying. He gave the icon to Garnier for safekeeping. Likewise, after the fall of Constantinople, the numerous icons and relics plundered from the city's churches were given to Garnier on the order of the Papal legate, Peter of Capua, pending a final division of the booty. He refused to release the head of Saint Mammes to the priest Walon de Dampierre, who only obtained it from the legate after Garnier's death. Garnier was one of the six ecclesiastical electors who, together with six Venetian electors, chose the new emperor, Baldwin I, on 9 May 1204. During the coronation festivities on 17 May, Garnier and the bishops of Soissons, Halberstadt and Bethlehem blessed the crown and placed it on Baldwin's head, then led him to the throne. In a church dedicated to Saint Victor by the Golden Gate, Garnier discovered a relic of the head of the saint. At the request of his own chaplain, Peter, he had the head sent back to Pierre de Corbeil, archbishop of Sens and his superior. The archbishop in turn gifted the relic to the Canons Regular of Saint Victor in Paris. Garnier died on 14 April 1205 in Constantinople and was buried there. On that same day, the crusaders suffered a major defeat at Adrianople against the Bulgarians.

Its full name is the Jan Shrem and Maria Manetti Shrem Museum of Art. The museum opened on November 13, 2016. According to the New York Times, the museum includes \\"trailblazing contributions by the school‚Äôs renowned art faculty, which contributed to innovations in conceptual, performance and video art in the 1960s and 70s\\". Background Richard L. Nelson was the founder of the art department at UC Davis, and he recruited a faculty in the early 1960s that included highly successful artists such as Wayne Thiebaud, Robert Arneson, Roy De Forest, Manuel Neri, Roland Petersen and William T. Wiley. Several were associated with the Funk art genre. In a negative 1981 review in the New York Times, conservative art critic Hilton Kramer referred to Arneson as the leader of \\"a spirit best defined as defiant provincialism\\" at UC Davis. That phrase has since been embraced as a defining description by artists associated with UC Davis. For nearly 60 years, the art faculty hoped for and discussed the possibility of building a dedicated art museum, according to museum director Rachel Teagle. Financing Margrit Mondavi, widow of Napa Valley winemaker Robert Mondavi, made an initial $2 million donation to begin the project. Napa Valley winemaker Jan Shrem, founder of Clos Pegase winery, and his wife Maria Manetti Shrem, donated $10 million of the $30 million budget for building the museum. Design The architects were Florian Idenburg and Jing Liu of the firm SO-IL of Brooklyn, who partnered with local architect Bohlin Cywinski Jackson. Writing in the Los Angeles Times, architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne described the building: \\"Inside, a lobby with lightly polished concrete floors is lined with a sweeping curve of floor-to-ceiling glass. As you enter, a multipurpose room that can be arranged as an auditorium is off to the left, with classrooms, studios and museum offices straight ahead. To the right are the galleries, which fill rooms of varying sizes and heights and are topped with a ceiling of aluminum mesh, through which mechanical equipment is left visible.\\" A \\"focal point\\" of the design is the Grand Canopy, a structure of swooping curves that surrounds the museum. Described as a \\"perforated aluminum and steel roof that creates textured light and shadows throughout the grounds\\", it was inspired by the geometry of the farm fields that surround Davis. According to acting university chancellor Ralph Hexter, \\"Students, faculty, staff and the public all will be able to enjoy our rich art legacy and history at UC Davis in a gorgeous and inviting building at the gateway to our campus. Our new museum stresses education first and foremost, with classrooms, a working studio for students and other resources near the entrance where all can see and enjoy for generations to come.\\" Collection The museum owns nearly 6,000 art objects, including many works by Bruce Nauman, a 1966 MFA graduate of the university. Wayne Thiebaud has donated 72 of his own works and 300 works by other artists to the museum's permanent collection. In addition to his financial support, Jan Shrem has also donated works of art including sculptures from his collection to the museum's collection.

The mountain is part of the Methow Mountains in the Cascade Range. Big Kangaroo is the high point of Kangaroo Ridge which is about two miles east and within view of Washington Pass. Its nearest higher peak is Snagtooth Ridge, to the northeast. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Early Winters Creek which is a tributary of the Methow River. Climate Big Kangaroo is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris.

The conservation park occupies land in the cadastral units of the Hundreds of Barwell, Blesing, Cowan and Kappawanta located to the immediate west of the Tod Highway and to the immediate south of the Birdseye Highway. Land within the extent of the conservation park as of 2017 first obtained protected area status as the Bascombe Well National Park on 2 July 1970 under the National Parks and Wildlife Reserves Act 1891-1960 In 1972, it was constituted as a conservation park upon the proclamation of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 on 27 April 1972. Additions of land to the conservation park in the Hundred of Cowan during 1979 and in both the Hundreds of Blesing and Cowan during 1980. Crown land located in the hundreds of Blesing and Cowan which had been previously dedicated as a conservation reserve known as the Bascombe Well Conservation Reserve under the Crown Lands Act 1929 in 1993 was added to the conservation park on 22 March 2007. The name is derived from Bascombe Well, a feature located within its boundaries. The land previously part of the Bascombe Well Conservation Reserve is subject to access under the Mining Act 1971. The land on which the conservation park is located was used for at least a century for pastoral purposes firstly by Price Maurice following by others until 1967 when the lease was resumed by the Government of South Australia. The previous use is evident by the remains of buildings and stone fences throughout the conservation park. As of 2007, the conservation park was reported to support the following species of flora: # Tree communities observed included ‚Äúmallee communities‚Äù dominated by Coastal White Mallee and Mallee Box along with ‚Äúoccasional Red Gum woodlands‚Äù which are believed to be supported by ‚Äúsmall groundwater lenses‚Äù, which are present at a shallow depth. #14 plant species of conservation significance have been recorded included West Coast mintbush, limestone leek-orchid and Thysanotus nudicaulis. #Introduced weed species such as bridal creeper, boxthorn and horehound. As of 2007, the conservation park was reported to support the following species of fauna: # Twelve species of mammal have been recorded of which seven of which are indigenous ‚Äúincluding three species of bat.‚Äù The discovery of the grey- bellied dunnart both in the conservation park and the Hincks Wilderness Protection Area during December 2004 represented ‚Äúa significant range extension from Western Australia‚Äù where the species had previously been observed. Introduced species observed include the European rabbit, the red fox, the feral cat and the house mouse. # 85 species of bird have been recorded of which 84 are indigenous including the following species of conservation significance at both state and national level - blue-breasted fairywren, chestnut quail-thrush, malleefowl, painted buttonquail and shining bronze cuckoo. The sole recorded introduced species is the common starling. #Twenty-two species of reptile and one species of amphibian were recorded including the following species of conservation significance at state level - the jacky lizard and the Dwarf Four-toed Slider. The sole species of amphibian is the trilling frog. As of 2007, visitor numbers were reported as being ‚Äúlow‚Äù and that the ‚Äúmain recreational pursuit‚Äù was ‚Äúpicnicking, which is undertaken at the ruins.‚Äù Also, access to and travel within the conservation park was via tracks suitable only for four-wheel drive vehicles and that no visitor facilities had been provided on the assumption that visitors will be ‚Äúself- reliant.‚Äù The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category VI protected area.

At the establishment of the WA parliament in 1897, Ministerialists were defined as those who supported the government of the day (led by John Forrest), while Oppositionists were opposed to it. Multiple candidates for each grouping could run for a given seat. The Australian Labour Party (ALP) was the only major grouping outside this structure. Additionally, some candidates ran as an \\"Independent\\". At the 1901 WA election, the Ministerialists (aligned with Forrest) lost to the Oppositionists (lead by George Leake). However, the labels stuck to the groupings, and the \\"Oppositionists\\" now had power and the ministries. This strange use of nomenclature ceased with the defeat of the Oppositionists by the Ministerialists at the 1904 election. Around this point, the term \\"Oppositionist\\" ceased to be used. The Ministerialists were then to retain power until their defeat by the ALP at the 1911 election. Immediately after this, the Ministerialist grouping became the centre-right Western Australian Liberal Party (1911‚Äì17) under the continued guidance of John Forrest.Note at the end of the speech build up a good patriotic Liberal Party In the 1920s, the centre-right Nationalist party (heirs to the Liberal Party) retained the practice of allowing multiple party candidates to compete against each other in a single member seat.

Exterior The Renault Trezor with its roof open Renault Trezor rear The car is unique due to its lack of lines across the body with the only visible seam occurring where the roof connects to the lower portion of the car. The main reason for the lack of visible seams is its clamshell style roof which opens up to allow passengers to enter the interior. The single piece canopy opens by hinging forward on struts. The car also uses a carbon-fiber chassis and a wooden frame under the bonnet, which was built with French bicycle manufacturer KEIM, to function as a luggage rack. It had to carry on the legacy of the DeZir, extreme beauty and economy while sacrificing top speed. The car has a drag coefficient of 0.22 which makes it one of the most aerodynamically efficient cars in the world. The exterior lighting signature of the car changes when switched to autonomous mode. The car rides on 21 inch front and 22 inch rear wheels with gaps between spokes in the shape of the Eiffel Tower, besides carbon-fiber scoops to aid in brake cooling. There are no doors, instead you open the roof and climb out. Interior The car has an electric motor developing and torque, allowing the car to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in less than four seconds. The car has two battery packs with independent cooling systems optimized by variable geometry honeycomb shaped air intakes in front. The car has a brake operated energy recovery system, developed from the Rechargeable Energy Storage System (RESS) technology developed for Formula E cars. The interior and the windshield of the car are colored red. The car also has an OLED touchscreen covered with Gorilla Glass on both the center console and steering wheel.

The 1910 building is now a City of Houston historic landmark and is owned by the city government. History It first opened in 1902 as the Kirby School. A man named Rufus Cage donated the land which housed the school. It moved into another building, across from the original, in 1906.\\"Elementary Schools (A-J).\\" Houston Independent School District. Retrieved on March 5, 2017. In 1910 a new building opened on that site. The building, designed by Jones and Tabor company, was designed more like a school in a city than one in a rural area. The school was originally owned by Harris County, but in 1914 the City of Houston took control. Initially the Houston school district closed Kirby School and redirected all students to Eastwood Elementary (now Lantrip Elementary School), but area parents complained. The Kirby building was repurposed into an apartment complex, and the tenants kept cattle there. The school reopened after 11 years of apartment usage. In 1923 Cage died, and the school, which reopened in 1925, was now Cage Elementary School. Food was cooked using a kerosene stove provided by the Cage Elementary mothers' association since initially the school was not supplied with cooking equipment nor water. A cafeteria and an addition were installed in the 1940s. In the 1950s the school had 251 students. The parents opposed closure requests during that decade; the parent-teacher organization of Cage at the time had 314 persons on its membership roster. Cage was previously reserved for white children (Hispanics being categorized as white prior to 1970Kellar, William Henry.

At a later point a storm damaged the roof. In 2011 HISD put Cage up for sale, stating that it needed to ensure its budget would remain balanced. Area residents were concerned that HISD could sell it to a party that would demolish the building. - Alternate link at the Eastwood Civic Association In October 2011 several area residents asked HISD to sell the former Cage school to the City of Houston. The City of Houston offered to buy the old Cage in exchange for a right-of-way purchase credit of $100,000. HISD accepted the offer. In 2012 the City of Houston designated Cage a protected historic landmark. Activist Lenwood Johnson, known for his advocacy for the Fourth Ward, criticized Mayor of Houston Annise Parker for seeking to preserve the original Cage Elementary while not doing enough to preserve the Fourth Ward. Operations Circa 1996 the school allowed fifth graders with academic success to move on to Jackson Middle School (now Yolanda Navarro Middle School) in the sixth grade, while it had an in-house sixth grade program for students who previously faced academic and/or maturity issues. Curriculum The current Cage Elementary School campus also houses the Project Chrysalis middle school program By 2005 the school implemented \\"Reading Buddies\\", a program in which students of higher grade levels read books to students of lower grade levels.

The Department of Public Works and Highways plans of a road widening project which would affect a portion of the cemetery's perimeter received nationwide attention in May 2015 but no part of the cemetery's walls was demolished following an appeal by local officials to the transportation department. A pit was dug inside the structure of the cemetery's Spanish Baroque mortuary chapel by treasure hunters compromising the integrity of the structure. The digging of the pit reportedly had the authorization of the parish priest of San Joaquin and was commenced as early as December 2015. The parish priest who took a leave of absence was replaced by the Jaro Archdiocese. A restoration effort was finished by November 2016 which saw the filling of the pit of a proper mixture of soil, rocks and cement initiated by the Archdiocese of Jaro through the assigned Parish Administrator delegated by the Archbishop.

It dates back to the early 16th century and originally served as headquarters and shooting range of the local schutterij (civic guard). Most of the current building at Singel 421 dates to the 18th century and is part of the main complex of the Amsterdam University Library. The Doelenzaal hall on the ground floor of the building (not to be confused with the Doelenzaal on Kloveniersburgwal canal) is used for lectures, meetings, receptions and doctoral dissertations. The building has rijksmonument status.\\"Singel 421, Amsterdam\\", Monumenten.nl (Dutch, archived)  History  = Shooting range = The Handboogdoelen, also known as the Garnalendoelen, Grote Doelen or St. Sebastiaansdoelen (after the patron saint of archers, Saint Sebastian) was one of three doelens (shooting ranges) for the Amsterdam schutterij (civic guard). The other two shooting ranges were the Voetboogdoelen and Kloveniersdoelen, located along the Singel and Kloveniersburgwal canals respectively. The Handboogdoelen civic guard was armed with longbows, while the Voetboogdoelen civic guard wielded crossbows and the Kloveniersdoelen civic guard used an early type of musket, the arquebus. The headquarters of the Handboogdoelen was the largest and grandest of the three.H. de la Fontaine Verwey, \\"Herinneringen van een bibliothecaris'\\", De boekenwereld, Jaargang 3. Uitgeverij Matrijs, Utrecht, 1986-1987 (Dutch, archived) The Handboogdoelen was established shortly before 1500 as the shooting range for the handboogschutterij (longbowmen's civic guard), and the associated building was completed around 1512. Like the adjacent Voetboogdoelen (established in 1458), the shooting range extended from the Singel canal to the back side of the houses on Kalverstraat.\\"Voormalige St. Sebastiaans- of Handboogdoelen met voorgevel in Amsterdam\\", Rijksmonumenten.nl (Dutch, archived)\\"Heiligeweg 32\\", Amsterdam Archeologische Rapporten, Gemeente Amsterdam Bureau Monumenten & Archeologie, 2013 (Dutch) Amsterdam's militia guilds were formed in the Middle Ages to defend the city against attack. Around 1580, at the behest of William of Orange, these Medieval guilds were incorporated into a new, much larger civic guard to defend the newly Protestant city against the Spanish during the Dutch revolt which ultimately led to a full-blown war of independence, the Eighty Years' War. Officers of this new civic guard were recruited from the well-to- do of Amsterdam.\\"The Company of Captain Dirck Jacobsz Rosecrans and Lieutenant Pauw, Cornelis Ketel, 1588\\", Rijksmuseum (archived) The Handboogdoelen was used by the civic guard from about 1509. In 1533, two bay windows were added to the building, the first known examples of bay windows in Amsterdam.Theo Rouwhorst, \\"Erkers\\", Binnenstad 223/224, Oct. 2007 (Dutch, archived) The shooting range lay behind the building, stretching north towards the Kalverstraat. A small gate provided access to the shooting range. This gate, dating to about 1650, is still in existence and is now located on Handboogstraat, a small street running behind the building. The gate features Doric columns and depicts bows and arrows and quivers. In the mid-17th century, the Eighty Years' War ended and the civic guard no longer served a military purpose. The civic guard continued to exist, but membership became an honorary position and the doelens assumed a primarily social function. The wealthiest and most powerful citizens of Dutch Golden Age Amsterdam came together in the doelens to eat, drink and smoke. In 1650 the city gave permission for houses to be built on the former shooting ranges of the Hand- and Voetboogdoelen. For these houses, two new streets were constructed: the Handboogstraat and Voetboogstraat. =Inn and hotel= In the 17th century, the building was also in use as lodgings for prominent visitors to Amsterdam. Its role as shooting range and headquarters of the civic guard ended in 1672, when the building was rented out to an innkeeper. In the late 17th century, the inn was expanded with additional rooms and halls by adding another floor to the building and connecting it to the adjacent house. A new facade was added to the building in 1733, depicting the coat of arms of the city of Amsterdam at the top, as well as five smaller coats of arms between the windows below: the coat of arms of the civic guard and those of four overlieden (directors) of the civic guard, including Frans Banning Cocq, who features as the central figure in Rembrandt's The Night Watch. The building served as a meeting place for the radical political faction of the Patriotten in the late 18th century. For instance, a large feast was held in the banqueting hall in 1786 to celebrate a Dutch alliance with France. In the 19th century, the inn transformed into a well-respected hotel, known as Hotel de Garnalen Doelen. =University library= In 1860, the city of Amsterdam offered the building to the Athenaeum Illustre, the predecessor of the University of Amsterdam. The city library, predecessor of the Amsterdam University Library, moved there around 1881 from the Agnietenkapel, as this chapel had become to small and derelict to house the library. The Handboogdoelen remains part of the main university library complex to this day. In the 20th century, the adjacent buildings were added to the library complex. Physicist Johannes Diderik van der Waals established his first laboratory in the building. He remained there until about 1883, when his laboratory was moved to a new building on Plantage Muidergracht canal.A.J. Kox,\\"Honderdvijfentwintig jaar theoretische natuurkunde in Amsterdam\\", University of Amsterdam (Dutch, archived) A 1968 restoration uncovered the original 16th-century building, revealing that it may contain the city's oldest remaining masonry work and the only remaining late-Medieval mantelpiece.  Painting  Members of the civic guard, drawn from the well- to-do of Amsterdam, frequently commissioned group portraits of themselves, which were hung in the doelens. For instance, Jan Tengnagel in 1613 painted a rot (section) of 17 members of the handboogschutterij (longbowmens' civic guard) under the command of Geurt van Beuningen. This painting is now in the Rijksmuseum. Around 1653, Bartholomeus van der Helst portraited the overlieden (directors) of the longbowmens' civic guard. This painting is now in the Louvre in Paris. Jan Weenix painted a wall covering for the Handboogdoelen depicting a hunting scene. The painting is now on display in the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague. Rembrandt sketched the front facade of the Handboogdoelen.

The Dutch towns of Middelburg and Goes also had a Handboogdoelen for their civic guards of longbowmen.

All 12 crew were killed. (Joe Baugher cites the date as 5 May 1943, but this is incorrect.) Approaching the airport from the southwest in light rain, light fog and light smoke, with a 500-foot ceiling and .75 miles visibility, the bomber circled the field to the north and east, and was on a southern heading when it struck the approximately tank at the 125-foot level, initially with the left wingtip. Much of the forward fuselage fell inside the tank structure which exploded, throwing steel plate over with heat felt over a mile away. Nine employees were on the grounds but none were injured.

It is a melodrama based on a French dramatization of the 1844 novella by Alexandre Dumas. Background From 1850 Dion Boucicault was employed by the actor Charles Kean, who leased the Princess's Theatre, London, as the house dramatist. Boucicault, fluent in French, travelled to France to find plays he could adapt for the English stage; a result of this was The Corsican Brothers, adapted from the 1850 play Les Freres corses by Eug√®ne Grang√© and Xavier de Mont√©pin.Geraint D'Arcy.

Cambridge University Press Archive, 1984.Page 6Les Freres corses, The Corsican Brothers University of Kent Special Collections, accessed 4 March 2017. The play, directed by Charles Kean, opened at the Princess's Theatre on 24 February 1852. Charles Kean played both of the brothers Fabien dei Franchi and Louis dei Franchi, and Alfred Wigan played Chateau- Renaud.Taylor, George. Players and performances in the Victorian Theatre. Manchester University Press, 1989. Page 23. Synopsis Act I and Act II are understood as taking place at the same time. Each of the brothers Fabien dei Franchi and Louis dei Franchi are able to sense if the other is in danger. Act I At his home in a castle in Corsica, Fabien dei Franchi becomes aware that his brother Louis, in Paris, is in danger. At the end of the act, after making peace between feuding local families, he has a vision of Louis' death in a duel. Act II The events leading to the duel are described. Louis has travelled to Paris to find Emilie de L'Esparre, with whom he has fallen in love. She has married, and he vows to accept the situation; her husband admires Louis' honesty in admitting the past affair, and asks him to protect her while he is away. Chateau-Renaud, known as a womanizer and duellist, is pursuing Madame L'Esparre, and he challenges Louis to a duel. In the Forest of Fontainebleau, Louis is wounded in the ensuing sword fight; before he dies he tells his second that his brother will avenge his death. Act III Chateau-Renaud, with his friend and second Baron de Montgiron, try to flee the country, but their carriage crashes in the same clearing in the forest. Fabien dei Franchi appears: they think it is the ghost of Louis until he introduces himself. After a long sword fight, Chateau-Renaud is killed. At the end, the ghost of Louis appears once more. Critical reception George Henry Lewes wrote: \\"Charles Kean... seems now... settling down into the conviction that his talent does not lie in any Shakespearian sphere whatever, but in melodrames.... Charles Kean plays the two brothers; and you must see him before you will believe how well and quietly he plays them; preserving a gentlemany demeanour, a drawingroom manner very difficult to assume on the stage, if one may judge from its rarity, which intensifies the passion of the part, and gives it a terrible reality.... The duel between him and Wigan was a masterpiece on both sides; the Bois de Boulogne itself has scarcely seen a duel more real or more exciting....\\"The Leader, 28 February 1852. Quoted in: Taylor, George. Players and performances in the Victorian Theatre. Manchester University Press, 1989. Pages 27‚Äì28. A special sort of trap door, afterwards known as a Corsican trap, glide trap or ghost glide, was made for the play. It gave the impression of a ghost gliding across the stage as it rose up through the floor. It was an important part of the play's success, and was installed in theatres where the play was produced.Trap Doors On Stage Theatrecrafts.com, accessed 4 March 2017. \\"First the head was seen, and then, as it slowly ascended higher and higher, the figure advanced, increasing in stature as it neared him, and the profound silence of the audience denoted how wrapt was their attention. Melodramatic effect was never more perfectly produced\\".The Era, 29 February 1852. Quoted in: Geraint D'Arcy. The Corsican Trap: Its Mechanism and Reception Questia Online Library, accessed 4 March 2017. The play was very successful: it soon ran at other London theatres, and in the following months it opened at the Adelphi Theatre in Edinburgh and at the Queen's Royal Theatre in Dublin. At the Princess's Theatre it had 236 performances during Kean's eight-year tenancy. Queen Victoria saw the play several times, and Prince Albert commissioned Edward Henry Corbould to paint a scene from the play.

The elements of this class are found in all animals, including humans. They can also be found in protists and bacteria. The class is named after its two best-studied members, the Tc1 transposon of Caenorhabditis elegans and the mariner transposon of Drosophila.  Structure  thumbupright=1.4A. Structure of DNA transposons (Mariner type). B. Mechanism of transposition The transposon consists of a transposase gene, flanked by two terminal inverted repeats (TIR). Two short tandem site duplications (TSD) are present on both sides of the insert. Transposition happens when two transposases recognize and bind to TIR sequences, join together and promote DNA double-strand cleavage. The DNA-transposase complex then inserts its DNA cargo at specific DNA motifs elsewhere in the genome, creating short TSDs upon integration. In the IS630/Tc1/mariner system, the motif used is a \\"TA\\" dinucleotide, duplicated on both ends after insertion. When the transposase gene is not carried by the transposon, it becomes a non-autonomous in that it now requires the gene to be expressed elsewhere to move around. = Transposase = Structural features of SB transposase. The 360-amino acid polypeptide has three major subdomains: the amino-terminal DNA-recognition domain that is responsible for binding to the DR sequences in the mirrored IR/DR sequences of the transposon, a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), and a DDE domain that catalyzes the cut-and-paste set of reactions that comprise transposition. The DNA-recognition domain has two paired box sequences that can bind to DNA and are related to various motifs found on some transcription factors; the two paired boxes are labeled PAI and RED, both having the helix- turn-helix motif common for DNA-binding domains. The catalytic domain has the hallmark DDE (sometimes DDD) amino acids that are found in many transposase and recombinase enzymes. In addition, there is a region that is highly enriched in glycine (G) amino acids. Several signatures for the superfamily of transcriptases have been given in various domain databases given the multi- domain nature of the protein. In addition, each domain are often represented by multiple entries, such as // among others for the \\"PAI\\" half of the box. The RED box is similarly dive rse (//, etc.) and is often in a winged HTH form for DNA recognition.  Sub-groups  The Tc1/mariner superfamily is generally subdivided by the catalytic domains of its transposase. It generally use a DDE (Asp-Asp-Glu) or DDD catalytic triad. = Tc1 = Tc1 (DD34E) is a transposon active in Caenorhabditis elegans. There are also Tc1-like transposons in humans, all inactive. Tc1-like elements are present in other lower vertebrates, including several fish species and amphibians. In C. elegans, it is a 1610 base-pair long sequence. Experiments show that this element \\"jumps\\" in human cells, with its transposase as the only protein required. Another example of this family is Tc3, also a transposon found in C. elegans. = Mariner = Mariner (DD34D) elements are found in multiple species, including humans. The Mariner transposon was first discovered by Jacobson and Hartl in Drosophila in 1986. A classification of the group was published in 1993, which divided such sequences in insects into the mauritiana, cecropia, mellifera, irritans, and capitata subfamilies, after the types of insects they are found in. The classification does extend to other species. This transposable element is known for its uncanny ability to be transmitted horizontally in many species. There are an estimated 14,000 copies of Mariner in the human genome comprising 2.6 million base pairs. The first mariner-element transposons outside of animals were found in Trichomonas vaginalis. Human Mariner-like transposons are divided into Hsmar1 (cecropia) and Hsmar2 (irritans) subfamilies. Although both types are inactive, one copy of Hsmar1 found in the SETMAR gene is under selection as it provides DNA-binding for the histone- modifying protein. Hsmar2 has been reconstructed multiple times from the fossil sequences. Mos1 (for Mosaic element) was discovered in Drosophila mauritiana. The Himar1 element has been isolated from the horn fly, Haematobia irritans and can be used as a genetic tool in Escherichia coli. = Other families = The rosa (DD41D) family is a family found in Ceratitis rosa. Pogo/Fot1 (DDxD) is yet another family in this superfamily, x indicating a variable length. IS630, a mobile element in Shigella sonnei, also belongs to this superfamily. A few additional new families with different lengths between the triads have been reported. Pogo, also known as Tigger in humans, has been domesticated by humans and yeast alike into the CENPB gene. Other human domestications of pogo include TIGD1, TIGD2, TIGD3, TIGD4, TIGD5, TIGD6, TIGD7, JRK, JRKL, POGK, and POGZ.  Trivia  The characteristics of the Mariner transposon inspired the science fiction novel The Mariner Project by Bob Marr.

It has since extended its scope to include open circuit scuba training and training for both recreational and technical diving sectors as well as snorkeling and freediving. History RAID was founded in 2007 by Barry Coleman to support diver training required for the Poseidon Mk VI Discovery Rebreather. RAID first developed training for rebreathers, they have since extended their programmes to include open circuit courses and both the recreational and technical levels. Barry Coleman is still working for RAID. RAID offers a complete range of online diver academic programs from beginner to instructor examiner levels in snorkeling, scuba and freediving. Barry Coleman sold shares to Jim Holiday and Paul V. Toomer in 2014. Jim Holiday was CEO / President until 2018. During this time RAID experienced exceptional growth and in 2018 RAID was purchased by Kalkomey Inc from Dallas TX. Paul V. Toomer, previously Director of Technical Training for Scuba Schools International, was appointed as Director of Diver Training for RAID in 2014. And President in 2019. In June 2016 RAID joined the United States Recreational Scuba Training Council as the first associate member. July 2016 they partnered with the Dive Pirates Foundation to bring adaptive scuba to more dive centers. Adaptive training is a system for adapting the skills training procedures to a better fit for the individual disabled but otherwise medically fit diver's personal requirements and abilities. The same theory, and skills training and assessment is used as for other divers. In October 2017, RAID obtained European Underwater Federation certification. In April 2018 RAID is purchased by Kalkomey Enterprises, LLC to expand their range of outdoor courses. Recognition RAID is a member of the United States Recreational Scuba Training Council (RSTC). RAID is a member of the Rebreather Training Council. RAID obtained CEN and ISO certification from the EUF certification body in October 2017 for the following certifications: *ISO 24801-2 - RAID Open Water 20 *ISO 24801-3 - RAID Dive Master *ISO 24802-2 - RAID Open Circuit Instructor *ISO 11107 - RAID Nitrox Speciality *ISO 11121 - RAID Try Open Circuit Diving *ISO 13293 - RAID O2 Service and Gas Blender Certification issued by RAID is approved by the UK Health and Safety Executive for divers whose duties are described in regulations 10, 12, and 13 of the Diving at Work Regulations 1997. Training system RAID differs from the rest of the industry by having a comprehensive online training system. RAID claims to have the most advanced training model in the industry today, with over 60 programs online. Their no classroom approach covers their entire spectrum of training from snorkeling to rebreather diving. Delivering theory training online with no paper, no book and no plastic has allowed them to claim they have zero environmental impact. Once a course is passed the learner has lifetime access to that material. However, if a course is not completed in 6 months the learner will have to re- register. Academic material and certification are linked to the registration so, each student must register for their own class.

His literary work known as ≈öiva J√±ƒÅna Bodham on Shaiva Siddhanta has enjoyed great vogue and prestige among Tamilians compared to other well-known Hindu philosophies such as Advaita of Adi Shankara and Vishistadvaita of Ramanuja.  Background  Meykandar was born to Achyuta KalappƒÅlar and Mangalambikai, ardent devotees of Lord Shiva who lived in the TirupennƒÅkadam village of present-day Cuddalore District, Tamil Nadu. It is said that they were troubled over their childless state which led them to be counselled by their family guru, SakalƒÅgama Panditar, who advised them to do a penance at Thiruvenkadu Siva Temple. As a result, conceived and gave birth to a boy. They named him \\"Swethavana perumƒÅl\\", after the name of the deity at Thiruvenkadu. Swetavana Perumal was brought to his maternal hometown Thiruvennainallur by his uncle. One day while he was playing in the street, he was attracted by Rishi Paranjyoti, who \\"descended from Kailash\\". Paranjyoti initiated Swetavana Perumal as his disciple and gave him the diksha NƒÅmam, \\"Mey KandƒÅr\\", the Tamil equivalent of his guru's name, Satya njnana darshini. Meykandar composed ≈öiva J√±ƒÅna Bodham, the core treatise of Southern Siddhanta tradition. It contains twelve aphorisms (Sutras) running to a total of forty lines, and deals with the nature of the three components of Saivism (Pati- Pashu-Pasam), and the means of attaining oneness with Siva. Many researchers conclude that ≈öivaj√±ƒÅnabodham might have been composed around 1223 CE. Santana Kuravar Sivan kovil at Thiruvennainallur, the living place of Meykandar. SakalƒÅgama Panditar, the family guru of Meykandar, once visited Meykandar and surprisingly became his disciple. He, later known as Arulnandi Sivan, composed Shiva Njana Siddiyar and Irupa irupahthu, in which he seconded Meykandar's ≈öiva J√±ƒÅna Bodham. Arulnandi sivan's disciple Marai njana Sampandar was the guru of Umapati Sivan who composed another eight texts explaining Saiva Siddhanta. These four personages ‚Äì Meykandar, Arulnandi Sivan, Marai njana Sampandar and Umapati Sivan are revered by the Tamil Siddhantins as \\"SantƒÅna Kuravars\\" (Lineage of Gurus).  Meykandar Siddhantism  Saiva Siddhanta Sampradaya was spread by Santana Kuravars during 13th and 14th centuries in Tamil land is known as \\"Meykandar Sampradaya\\" in philosophical perspective. It is also considered as a branch of Nandinatha Sampradaya, which flourished from the eight direct disciples (Sanatkumarar, Sanakar, Sanadanar, Sananthanar, Shivayogamuni, Patanjali, Vyaghrapada, and Tirumular) of Nandinatha. Meykandar Sampradaya is associated with the teachings of first disciple of Nandinatha ‚Äì Sanatkumarar.Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami (2003) \\"Dancing with Siva: Hinduism's Contemporary Catechism\\" Himalayan Academy Publications There are totally fourteen texts of Santana Kuravar and others admired by Tamil Saivites as Meykanda Saathirangal (Sastras of Meykandar or Sastras that perceived the truth). Though Saiva siddhanta is often identified as a pluralistic philosophy, it declares itself Vaidika Suddadvaita (Vedic Pure advaita) claiming that it interprets Advaita as it is.

She also became engaged in social work, founding the \\"Helferbund Rita von Gaudecker\\" welfare support organisation in 1945.Manfred Berger: Rita von Gaudecker. In: Kurt Franz, G√ºnter Lange/Franz- Josef Payrhuber (Hrsg.): Kinder- und Jugendliteratur. Ein Lexikon. Meitingen 2005, pp. 1‚Äì18.  Life  Rita Margarethe Klara Alexandra von Blittersdorf was born, the eighth of her parents' nine recorded children, in Molstow, a village near Greifenberg (as it was called before the ethnic cleansing of 1944/45) in East Pomermania. Her father, Carl Freiherr von Blittersdorf, was a minor aristocrat. Her mother, Ada Freiin von Behr, died from scarlet fever in March 1885, when she was not quite six. Her father never recovered from the blow, but she and her siblings nevertheless had a happy childhood. Looking back, she would later write: \\"What a truly untroubled existence a rural child has. Alongside the villagers, all the farm animals and the whole of nature. Gathering the unknowing powers of all these. Powers to defend and to transgress.\\"\\"Was lebt doch ein Landkind f√ºr ein echtes unverstelltes Dasein. Neben den Dorfleuten, allen Tieren des Hofes und der ganzen Natur. Unwissend Kr√§fte aus ihnen sammelnd. Kr√§fte der Abwehr und des √úberstehens.\\" Her Confirmation was followed by years as a \\"house daughter\\". Till 1906, when her youngest sister married, she took responsibility for running the household. Along with this, in 1914 she took charge of the \\"Kapellenverein Youth Association\\", also running its magazine, \\"Wir Wollen Helfen!\\" (\\"We want to help!\\"). From these beginnings, she occupied herself ever more as a writer, especially for children and young people. Her autobiographical children's book \\"Unter der Molstower Linde\\" (\\"Under the Molstow Linden Tree\\"), published in 1920, became a great success, and was still in print in the 1960s. Her religious works for children and Confirmation candidates also enjoyed great respect. These included \\"Weisst du, Wieviel Syernlein stehen? F√ºnfzig Kinderandachten\\" (\\"Do you know how many little stars there are? fifty children's adventures\\"), published in 1930, \\"So nimm denn meine H√§nde. F√ºnfzig Kinderandachten\\" (\\"So take my hands: fifty children's adventures\\"), published in 1933 and \\"Jesu geh vorn! F√ºnfzig Kinderandachten\\" (\\"Go forth Jesus: fifty children's adventures\\"), published in 1936. She also involved herself more generally in the affairs of the \\"Kapellenverein\\" a religious welfare organisation founded in Berlin in 1885, by to attend to the spiritual needs of impoverished workers from the east of Germany. The Kapellenverein had been concerning itself with child labour, and taking care of homeless and abusively treated children.Manfred Berger: Kroecher, Bertha Luise Ida von. In: Biographisch-Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon (BBKL). Band 24, Bautz, Nordhausen 2005, , Sp. 974‚Äì983. On 13 April 1914 Rita von Blittersdorf married the naval officer Gerhard Jobst August Moritz von Gaudecker. The marriage remained childless. After being stationed successively in Kiel, Constantinople and Wilhelmshaven the couple moved back to Pomerania. Here Rita von Gaudecker looked after what became a small network of several orphanages operated under the auspices of the Kapellenverein, the first of which had been relocated from Berlin to Kolberger Deep during the winter of 1916/17. A second was established in 1920/21 to look after the children of officers who had been killed in the recent war. Rita von Gaudecker was also in charge of a children's home in a house bequeathed to the Kapellenverein along Park Street Kolberg, where the focus was on children from villages who needed to be in the town in order to be able to attend school. For the younger children the establishment ran its own school under the direction of Rita von Gaudecker, helped by mostly young volunteers from the Christian organisation. Fund raising was a constant preoccupation, which she achieved both by personal visits to individual groups and using circular letters. Captain von Gaudecker kept the accounts. The change of government in January 1933 heralded a rapid and ultimately disastrous transition to a one-party dictatorship in Germany. It was far from easy to continue as before with the private running of a Christian children's home, with a shared Christian focus and frequent regular Christian worship. There was one senior Nazi who had once been a young helper at the home who was able to provide a level of protection. Nevertheless, the older children were obliged to join the Hitler Youth and then, following the outbreak in 1939 of another war, to become soldiers. Many came back from the front to spend any periods of army leave at Deep, but by the time the war ended, formally in May 1945, many had been killed in the fighting. At the start of 1945, with brutal ethnic cleansing underway in the east, the children were able to escape to Mecklenburg. They were then sent back, however, and survived for a few more months in Deep, which was now being inundated with refugees being forced out of Eastern Germany in order to make space for Polish refugees being forced out of what had previously been eastern Poland. In Deep, as the Soviet armies over-ran the region, the dangers facing the von Gaudeckers, now in their mid-sixties, were doubled on account of their aristocratic provenance (and name) and because Captain von Gaudecker was a retired army officer. They fled or were expelled from Deep and till October 1945 survived hunger and sickness, somehow, in the Berlin suburb of Treptow. From Berlin they moved to Holstein where they stayed till 1950 when they moved to stay with distant relatives on the other sid3e of the country, in Allmendingen (south of Ulm). Here Captain von Gaudecker, who had been in poor health for some time, died in 1954, while Rita was hospitalised with a broken hip, after which she was never again able to use stairs. Meanwhile, she had already, in 1945, founded the \\"Helferbund vom Kapellenverein\\", dedicated to the causes for which she had always worked, and while there were no longer children's homes, she had still been able to organise food parcels. After becoming immobilised in 1954 she seldom left her \\"large room in the tower\\" at her relatives' property in Allmendingen, but she remained energetic with her pen. In 1965 she finally retired from her chairmanship of the Helferbund which shortly afterwards was renamed as the \\"Verein in Helferbund Rita von Gaudecker e. V.\\", the name under which it still exists. Rita von Gaudecker died at the hospital in Ehingen, a couple of miles to the south of Allmendingen, on 18 March 1968.

He previously played for the De La Salle Green Archers in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP), Fuerza Regia of the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional, and the Chorale Roanne of LNB Pro B Early life Mbala is a native of Yaound√©, Cameroon. He was first into football until the age of 13 when he grew about 6 feet 2 inches tall and switched to playing basketball. His older brother who manages the junior team of their municipality urged him to play for the team. He attended Institute Ndi Samba for his high school studies and made attempts to join his school's varsity team on his first two years. He continued to play for his municipality's team and managed to play for his high school in his last two years of secondary education. Career =Camp in South Africa= Mbala participated twice at an annual national basketball camp organized by Luc Mbah a Moute. He failed in his goal of making the All-Star Selection on his first year of participation but achieved it on his second try when he was chosen as one of the top 20 players of the camp. He was further declared as one of the top five players of the Mbah a Moute's camp, which gave him the opportunity to participate in the Basketball Without Borders camp in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2011. At the South African Basketball Without Borders camp, he won the African MVP Honors. His feat would have enabled him to study in the United States under a scholarship but visa issues prevented him from studying there. =College career in the Philippines= Southwestern University Moustapha Arafat, a former player from the Philippine University of the East invited Mbala to play basketball in the Philippines. He heeded to the invitation and went to study in a school in Cebu City in the Philippines instead. Mbala played for the Cobras of the Cebu-based Southwestern University (SWU) in the Cebu Schools Athletic Foundation, Inc. (CESAFI) in 2012. He led his school to its first CESAFI title in the history of the collegiate tournament winning over the University of the Visayas. At the 2012 Philippine Collegiate Champions League he led his team to a fourth-place finish.

The 6'8\\" Center played for La Salle at the University Athletic Association of the Philippines basketball tournament. Mbala originally planned to study and play for the Ateneo de Manila University.https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/basketball/741549/la-salle- s-ben-mbala-reveals-he-almost-played-for-ateneo/story/ As a transfer student, Mbala had to serve a two-year residency. A one-year ban was imposed on him by the UAAP after he played at the Pacquiao Challenge Cup in December 2014 which was against the collegiate league's rules for players serving residency which caused him not to play for his school at UAAP Season 78. He was named part of the Mythical Five at the 2016 Filoil Flying V Preseason Premier Cup which was won by his team. At Season 79, Mbala made his UAAP debut for La Salle, and led the team to an 8‚Äì0 record halfway through the tournament and was the favorite to become the first foreigner to win the MVP Award since Anthony Williams of the FEU Tamaraws bagging the award in 1981 and he is the first Lasallian player who went on to win the MVP award since Don Allado who last won the said award in 1999. He was also the MVP in Season 80 despite his team losing to Ateneo in the finals. On 22 December 2017, Mbala announced his decision to not use his final year of eligibility and leave La Salle after five years. Mbala had one year of eligibility left to play for La Salle in Season 81. However his stint was uncertain since the UAAP board was set to discuss the \\"seven years out of high school\\" rule of the collegiate year which would have rendered him ineligible for the next season if the rule is abolished. =Professional career= Fuerza Regia Two days before Mbala announced his intention to leave La Salle, Fuerza Regia already announced via Instagram that Mbala will play for them. Mbala had a one-month stint with Fuerza Regia. According to his own account, Mbala was hindered by his veteran teammates while with Fuerza which made him unhappy with his stay with the Mexican ball club. Chorale Roanne French ballclub Chorale Roanne of LNB Pro B announced they have signed Mbala mid-January 2018. For Roanne, Mbala played 25 games where he averaged 11.6 points on 54 percent shooting and made an average of 5.6 rebounds per game. Mbala was made a role player in Chorale Roanne and was offered a contract renewal. However Mbala decided to move to South Korea after accepting an offer from the Seoul Samsung Thunders. Seoul Samsung Thunders On July 9, 2018, the Seoul Samsung Thunders of the Korean Basketball League announced that they have signed Mbala. Magnolia Hotshots Mbala became a standby player for the Magnolia Hotshots of the Philippine Basketball Association during the 2018 PBA Governors' Cup due to their import Romeo Travis sustained an injury.

As of that time, there were no rules in the UAAP preventing players to play for their national teams. While expressing gratitude for the invitation, Mbala declined as he did not want to risk his eligibility to play in the UAAP and had to maintain academic requirements to remain playing for his collegiate team. It was announced on February 5, 2017 that the Cameroon national team has included Mbala in their 30-man pool for the qualifiers and main tournament of the 2017 FIBA Africa Championship. He played for the national team in the aforementioned continental tournament.

It has been recorded in the Suez Canal and there have been a few records in the eastern Mediterranean, making it a Lessepsian migrant. Description Hyastenus hilgendorfi has a roughly pear-shaped carapace which is convex and bearing small tubercles and a downy coat, there is a small epibranchial plug. There are prominent projections on the gastric region, heart and gut. A pair of post-gastric tubercles are close to the orbits. Six mesobranchial tubercles are sub-equal to the sides of the midline. There are two divergent rostral spines, which have a length of two-thirds of the carapace in males but are much smaller in females. The retractable eyestalks are small. The chelipeds are the same length as the carapace, the merus has nodules in its proximal portion while the claw is smooth and glabrous. The merus of the pereopods also bear nodules, while the posterior border of the dactyl is spiny, the spines becoming successively larger distally. The separation of the rostral spines is u shaped or keyhole shaped. H. holgendorfi is a brownish colour. Distribution Hyastenus hilgendorfi occurs from the Red Sea through the Indian Ocean to the western Pacific to Hawaii and south to Australia. It is reported to occur throughout the Suez Canal and the first record in the Mediterranean was recorded off Israel in 1960. The second record was in 1977 ad the third in 2004, which may mean there is a small population in the south eastern Mediterranean. Biology Hyastenus hilgendorfi is found on seabeds of coarse sand, debris and gravel, between 2 and 93 metres in depth. It is a \\"decorator crab\\" which uses other organisms to cover its body and in a study in the Suez Canal the barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite, the tunicate Microcosmus sp., and the tube worm Hydroides elegans were found to be the most frequent epibionts. and up to 49 species of epbionts have been recognised for this species in the Suez Canal.

In 1855, the Eastgate Street market was rebuilt and modernised. The indoor shopping centre was built between 1966 and 1974 during a large redevelopment of Gloucester City centre.

Eastgate Shopping Centre consists of a large indoor street, with a ninety degree intersection in the middle. It runs from Eastgate Street to Southgate Street, with a side entrance to Greyfriars. The indoor street is lined with shops on both sides. At this time the centre also included a new market hall and a large Woolworths store which had entrances onto both Eastgate and Southgate street. The centre linked to the Longsmith Street car park and Kings Walk car parks. A pedestrian footbridge on the second floor spanned over Eastgate Street to link the Eastgate and Kings Walk shopping centres however, this has now been closed off. In 1994 redevelopment work was carried out which included some of the columns being faced with architectural features and the Beatrix Potter clock and figures were added next to the market. The cemetery from Greyfriars, founded in 1231, is now under the Eastgate shopping centre. The Mall Fund bought Eastgate shopping centre in 2004 for ¬£40 million from Catalyst Capital, then Rockspring Property Investment Managers and The Other Retail Group brought it in 2010 for ¬£136 million. In January 2019, Gloucester City Council bought the shopping centre in the region of ¬£12 million from Rockspring Property Investment Managers and The Other Retail Group. On 23 March 2009, Heart Gloucestershire was launched from the Bridge Studios within the shopping centre. Future Plans Between February 2018 and June 2018, work will be carried out to renovate the first floor of the shopping centre. The floor will be turned into a Digital Retail innovation Centre which will test and develop ‚Äúdisruptive digital innovations‚Äù, such as Robots and Holograms, in attempt to turn the shopping centre into a Digital Innovation Hub. Eleven small shop units are also being built. By 2025, it is planned to become a national centre for developing Holographic Virtual Employees and Robotic Security Guards. Gloucestershire's Local Enterprise Partnership program has provided ¬£400,000 to fund this project. Portico Entrance Eastgate Shopping Centre Portico Entrance The Portico entrance was built by Medland & Maberly in 1856 and was originally the entrance to the Eastgate market. In 1973, the portico was moved down Eastgate Street by about 25 feet from its original location to form the entrance to the new Eastgate Shopping Centre. The portico is made out of classical stone blocks. It is built in the monumental italianate style. The exterior consists of three arches with two central piers framed by a corinthian half column and two end piers framed by rectangular columns. All of the piers are set upon pedestals. Above the arches there is a crowning pediment with a clock in the middle flanked by seated figures sculpted in high relief. Father time is on the right and Ceres is the figure on the left. The crowning pediment supports an arched bell turret flanked by scrolls and topped with another pediment. There were pairs of Iron gates under each arch of the Portico. However, these were not replaced when it was rebuilt after being moved from the original site. In 2015, the original Iron gates were found in a council yard by the Gloucester Rotary Club. The portico became a grade II- listed building in 1975. Tailor of Gloucester clock- AKA Beatrix Potter Clock In 1994, due to the redevelopment of the shopping centre a large fish tank, inside the shopping centre next to the market entrance, was removed and the Beatrix Potter clock was added to replace it. The clock featured an animated Tailor of Gloucester, mice, owl and cat and took approximately fifteen months to build. On the hour, the clock would chime then music was played and all the figures would move. You would find crowds of people waiting to look at it. In 2013, another redevelopment off the shopping centre took place the clock was removed having been there since 1994. A petition to save the clock was created but the shopping centre donated it to the Pied Piper Appeal.

He was known for his work for Operaist journal Quaderni Rossi and his Marxist analysis of labour practices at Italian companies FIAT and Olivetti. Early life Alquati was born in 1935 in Klana, Croatia, where his father had been exiled because of his left-wing stance within the Italian Fascist party. When Alquati was 10, his father was executed by partisans in Vercelli in northern Italy. Alquati grew up in Cremona, where he shaped his political consciousness through meeting left-wing political militants, including Danilo Montaldi. Operaismo Before moving to Turin, he lived in Milan, at the political commune at via Sirtori 2. He moved to Turin when he was 25, where he joined the editorial staff of the political journal Quaderni Rossi alongside Raniero Panzieri, and in 1963 founded the journal Classe Operaia ('Working Class') with Mario Tronti and Antonio Negri Alquati's work studying labour practices in the Fiat factory in Turin was an early contribution to the sociology of work in Italy. He was influenced by the methodology of Danilo Montaldi and the barefoot researchers: he worked at the factories he was studying and lived with other workers. In this way, Alquati studied labour practices at the FIAT Mirafiori factory and at an Olivetti factory. His work stressed the nuances of and differences in the working class, and contributed to the idea of class composition developed by Operaist thinkers. Academic career In the early 1970s, Alquati left the factories to teach in universities, and continued to teach throughout the 1980s. His work anticipated deindustrialisation and the emergence of the service sector. During this period, his political thought diverged from earlier allies such as Toni Negri and Mario Tronti. He produced a study of the relationship universities to the working class, and taught a course on the subject at the University of Turin until 2003. His academic work focused on globalisation and its possible alternatives; the thought of Zygmunt Bauman on the liquid society; and women's history and politics.

Agency for Cultural Affairs Overview Located on a river terrace on the left bank of the Oirase River, approximately seven kilometers from the present-day Pacific coast at an altitude of 30 to 40 meters, this group of ancient tombs was variously known as the \\"Tenjinyama site\\" or the \\"Jusanmori site\\", and was believed by locals in pre-modern times to contain the graves of warriors, as evidenced by occasional fragments of swords and pottery which were uncovered by plowing nearby fields. After the discovery of magatama beads in April 1986, the site was extensively excavated between 1989 and 1990 by the local Oirase Town Board of Education, and were discovered to consist of 108 domed kofun dating from the first half of the 7th century to the early 9th century AD. Many of the tombs had a shallow circumferential groove resembling a small moat. The tombs contained the remnants of swords, agricultural tools, beads and other jewelry articles, Haji pottery, and horse harnesses and the remains of wooden sarcophagus. Many of items appear to have originated from the southern part of the Tohoku region, indicating frequent trade. The size of each tomb was approximately 10 meters in diameter, with a height of 1.1 meter. As the mounds are now flattened and do not appear above the present ground- level, a possibility exists that more undiscovered tombs exist in the area. Approximately 3 kilometers east of this necropolis is the Nakanodaira archeological site, where more than 100 pit dwellings were discovered. The Negishi archeological site, which was the site of a large pit dwelling, was also nearby, suggesting that the people of lived in the locations had some relationship with the construction of the tombs. In 2016, the town of Oirase completed construction of a local museum at the site. It is located approximately 10 minutes by car from the Aoimori Railway Mukaiyama Station.

The marshalling yard included access to the Perth Metropolitan Markets and other adjacent industrial sites. Most newspaper reports about the yard during its active years tended to be about accidents. Operationally, because of the proximity of the Perth railway station, a number of signal boxes were required to facilitate traffic into the yard and the interaction with regular services on the Fremantle railway line, as well as the Perth station until the reduction of services in the 1970s. The land occupied by the marshalling yard is now part of the Perth City Link project.

She was based in New York City. Early life and education Freedman was Jewish and born in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh to a traveling salesman and a nurse. As an adult Freedman photographed extensively in Ireland, quipping \\"I‚Äôm Jewish, but I adopted Ireland as my own old country\\".by Maureen Cavanagh October 16, 2019 pro-photo-daily Close-Up: Remembering Jill FreedmanBy Roslyn Bernstein December 6, 2017 Guernica In 1961, Freedman graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a major in sociology. In 1964 Freedman came to New York City and had several temporary jobs including advertising copywriter. She only discovered photography while experimenting with a friend's camera. Career After college, Freedman went to Israel, where she worked on a Kibbutz. She ran out of money and sang to make a living; she continued singing in Paris and on a television variety show in London. Freedman arrived in New York City in 1964, and worked in advertising and as a copywriter. As a photographer, she was self-taught, influenced by Andr√© Kert√©sz, idolizing W. Eugene Smith, but primarily helped by her poodle Fang: > When I was out walking in the street with Fang I saw everything, felt > everything. He had a great instinct. He taught me how to look, because he > never missed a thing. Andy Grundberg would also note the influences on her style of Smith, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Don McCullin, Leonard Freed, and Weegee; but would add that: \\"To appreciate [her] photographs one needs to consider their substance, not their style. . . . Human relationships ‚Äì especially the bonds of brotherhood ‚Äì fascinate her.\\" On hearing of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Freedman quit her job and went to Washington, DC. She lived in Resurrection City, a shantytown put up by the Poor People's Campaign on Washington Mall in 1968, and photographed there. Photographs from the series were published at the time in Life, and collected in Freedman's first book, Old News: Resurrection City, in 1970. A. D. Coleman wrote of the book: > It is a very personal yet highly objective statement, filled with passion, > warmth, sorrow and humor. Freedman's pictures are deft and strong; her text > witty, sardonic and honest, with quirky insights and touching moments of > self-revelation. A brave and moving book. Freedman then lived in a Volkswagen kombi, following the Clyde Beatty-Cole Brothers Circus. For two months, she photographed \\"two shows a day and one show each Sunday. Seven weeks of one night stands\\", and moving across New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, Pennsylvania and Ohio. She wanted to photograph the performers as people. (\\"If I wanted to do freaks, I'd do guys wearing ties in 100-degree weather ‚Äì to me that's freaks.\\"A temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit, or 38 degrees Celsius.) Coleman wrote: > [The photographs expose] both the photographer's own responses to people and > the personalities of her subjects. The moments she selects are significant > emotionally as well as graphically. Her images exclude the extraneous in an > inconspicuous way, and her sense of timing and gesture . . . is uncanny. The work was published as a book, Circus Days, in 1975. Freedman photographed the then sleazy area of 42nd Street and the arts scene in Studio 54 and SoHo. In 1975, Freedman started to photograph firefighters around Harlem and the Bronx. This took her two years; she lived with the firefighters, sleeping in the chief's car and on the floor. This resulted in a book, Firehouse, published in 1977‚Äîaccording to one review a book \\"flawed . . . by poor reproduction and inept layout\\". Some of the firefighters had previously been policemen, and they suggested that Freedman might photograph police work. Freedman had disliked the police but reasoned that there must be good policemen among them. For her series Street Cops (1978‚Äì1981), she accompanied the police to an area of New York City including Alphabet City and Times Square, spending time with those who seemed good cops. The work resulted in the book Street Cops. A contemporary reviewer for Popular Photography started by observing that \\"the passionate photojournalistic essay of yesterday\\" was \\"an endangered species\\", before saying that it lived on in photobooks such as this one. The reviewer described Street Cops as \\"[celebrating] the heroism, compassion, and humor of New York police professionals\\", and saying that the book \\"is traditional and satisfying in that it accomplishes a blend rarely successful ‚Äì or even attempted ‚Äì these days: an organic fusion of words and photographs\\". On photographing in New York at the time: > Hiding behind a camera, [Freedman] found her subjects where others were not > looking ‚Äì \\"beggars, panhandlers, people sleeping on the street,\\" the police > and the firefighters, the people washed ashore by forces bigger than > themselves. \\"It's the theater of the streets,\\" she said. \\"The weirder, the > better.\\" During the seventies, Freedman was briefly associated with Magnum Photos, but did not become a member. She wanted to tell stories via photography, but also wanted to avoid the schmoozing required to get commissions; and she therefore set her own tasks. She had difficulty making a living, but sold prints from a stand set up outside the Whitney Museum building. In 1983, New York Times critic Andy Grunberg recognized her black and white street photography in New York, grouping Freedman with Lee Friedlander, Fred R. Conrad, Bruce Davidson, Roy DeCarava, Bill Cunningham, Sara Krulwich and Rudy Burckhardt. In 1988, Freedman discovered that she was ill. The medical expenses meant that she had to leave her apartment above the Sullivan Street Playhouse;The Sullivan Street Playhouse occupied 181 Sullivan Street from 1958 to 2002. in 1991, she moved to Miami Beach; she was dissatisfied there but was able to read a lot. She sometimes worked for the Miami Herald. She also managed to publish a photobook of dogs that was praised for \\"[defying] the clich√©d images\\" of dog photography. She also published the second of two photobooks of Ireland, one that Publishers Weekly said \\"lovingly captures the enduring aspects of Irish tradition\\". Around 2003,\\"Five years ago\\", says a newspaper article published on April 27, 2008; therefore presumably in 2002 or 2003. Accessed March 4, 2017. Freedman moved back to New York. She was shocked and saddened by its sanitization during her absence: \\"When I saw that they had turned 42nd Street into Disneyland, . . . I just stood there and wept.\\" She moved to a place near Morningside Park in 2007, and was still living there in 2015. During the earlier part of her career, Freedman was captivated by the photographic printing process. She shot Kodak Tri-X and liked to use a 35 mm lens and available light, and to print on Agfa Portriga Rapid paper. As of late 2016, she neither had a darkroom nor missed it. She emphasized that the camera, whether film or digital, is merely a tool. When asked on another occasion, she approvingly cited Elliott Erwitt on not being boring and attempting to do excellent work; technical questions and even posterity should not be a concern. Freedman was one of 13 photographers shown photographing New York in Everybody Street, a 2013 film by Cheryl Dunn. Together with Richard Kalvar, Alex Webb, Rebecca Norris Webb, Maggie Steber and Matt Stuart, she was a featured guest in the Miami Street Photography Festival 2016 at HistoryMiami Museum during Art Basel week. Grundberg wrote in 1982 that \\"Indignation over injustice is the major key in [Freedman's] work, admiration for life's survivors the minor key.\\" Maggie Steber has said of Freedman: > I think she's been thoroughly under-recognized. . . . To me, Jill is one of > the great American photographers. Always has been and always will be. In 2016, Freedman's work and career, especially her images of New York City, was the subject of renewed interest, appearing in multiple Vice articles, including their 2016 photography issue and at Art Basel Miami. Personal life In her later life, Freedman lived in Harlem. On October 9, 2019, Freedman died from complications of cancer at a care facility in Manhattan.

It contains information on the geography, history, social custom and economy of territories of southern China, Guangxi in particular. More significantly it also provides knowledge of distant lands in China during the Song dynasty, and includes descriptions of oversea states as far away as Africa and southern Spain. Background The book was written in 1178 by Zhou Qufei. Zhou based his book largely on information he had gathered himself and other previous published works, particularly a book written by Fan Chengda. He worked for 6 years in Guangxi; and had worked as an assistant sub-prefect in Guilin, Guangxi. In Guilin, Zhou served for a time under Fan Chengda who wrote a book on the southern region of China, Guihai yuheng zhi (Ê°ÇÊµ∑ËôûË°°Âøó, \\"Well- balanced Records of Guihai\\"). Zhou received a copy of Fan's book while he was revising his own book to finish it, and he quoted extensively from Fan's work. The book also includes quotes from Huanghua Sida Ji (ÁöáËèØÂõõÈÅîË®ò) by the Tang dynasty geographer Jia Dan. Zhou had also worked as an Educational Commissioner in Qinzhou, a port in Guangxi, where he had the opportunity to question traders, sailors as well as interpreters for foreign merchants. He added the information on distance lands he had gathered in two chapters of the book he wrote. The original book is lost, and the current version was recompiled from entries in the Yongle Encyclopedia. A German translation, Das Ling-wai-tai-ta von Chou Ch'√º-fei: Eine Landeskunde S√ºdchinas aus dem 12. Jahrhundert, by Almut Netolitzky was published in 1977. Content There are ten chapters in the book, which concentrates mostly on the history, geography, custom and products of Guangxi, and it also contains information on southwest China, the Leizhou Peninsula of Guangdong as well as Hainan Island. It remains today an important reference for Guangxi of the Song era. Of particular interest are the two chapters that included descriptions of countries outside of China as well as their traded products. Some of the these are among the earliest accounts of distant countries as far away as Africa in Chinese records. As the information on foreign countries was gathered secondhand, the accounts given in the book may contain some exaggerations, inaccuracies and fanciful tales, but it gives a fairly accurate configuration of land and sea stretching from Korea to Spain. Some of the entries in the book were incorporated or adapted into Zhao Rugua's book Zhu Fan Zhi, for example this description of Mulanpi (Êú®Ëò≠ÁöÆ, Al-Murabitun) that covered part of northwest Africa (Morocco) and southern Spain, and it includes an early Chinese reference to northern Europe: See also *Zhu Fan Zhi *Daoyi Zhil√ºe References =Notes= External links * Lingwai Daida 1170s books Chinese prose texts ","title":"Lingwai Daida"},{"id":"53389404","text":"Pellenes striolatus is a jumping spider species in the genus Pellenes.

It is a humorous expose of the self-styled Godmen who make their living by duping innocent people. Plot Bhaajj (Gurpreet Ghuggi) is Punjabi man who owns a vehicle repair workshop and who hates women. Bhaajj's cousin Ravi works for him and his younger brother Rajveer is jobless. Rajveer seeks blessing from a local religious head Babaji (Yograj Singh) at his temple Ashram, Babaji's right hand preacher Swami gives his predicts to Rajveer that the latter will not find a job, but will start his own business. Inspired by Swami, Rajveer buys a second hand bus from a client of his older brother's workshop, and asks his older brother Bhaajj to renew it so that they can drive it as business. Bhaajj reluctantly agrees. They give all female passengers 50% discount as promotional strategy. and their advertisement emphasize on that they will protect all female passengers, unlike other buses, where female passengers are often harassed by men. One of their passengers Preet therefore develops her feeling for Rajveer. Soon, they find the business is hard for them as they can collect too few passengers each time, so they decide to use the bus as shuttle bus for Babaji's devotees. Babaji gives a trunk to Swami and Deepak (Harsharan Singh) with a girl's dead body inside, asking them to deal with the body smoothly. They agree, hinting this is not the first murder they have committed. They decide to use Rajveer's bus to drop the body. They load the trunk on the roof of the bus, planning to drop the body in a river when the bus crossing it. However, in the night, when the bus is passing a bridge and Deepak is almost dropping the body from the roof, Ravi, who is driving the bus at the time and very sleepy, suddenly hits the brake due to a sudden awake. Deepak unintentionally drops the body from the front side of the bus due to the shake. Ravi, Bhaaj and Rajveer get off the bus to check what happened. They are all shocked to see a dead body lying in front of the bus  which is nobody but Preet  and think it's Ravi that hit her to death. They decide to load it to the roof and drop it somewhere so that nobody will know it. The next day, they drop the trunk in a river when the bus is temporarily stopped. Two bums spot the scene, assuming the trunk is full of treasures and get it back. They catch another bus and on the roof to secretly open and share the \\"treasure\\". However, to their shock, it's dead body inside. When the bus stops, the bums move the trunk to the roof of another bus that is right beside theirs. The other bus happens to be Rajveer's. Ravi and Deepak are later shocked and scared to see that the trunk containing the dead body is back on the bus roof, thinking it has become a ghost and will take revenge. However, Ravi and his men decide to drop it again. When they arrive a hospital, they take to dead body inside and put it on a patient bed.

She is a professor and chairholder for English literature at the University of Zurich as well as a global distinguished professor at New York University. Her research interests include 19th- and 20th-century American and British literature, gender studies, psychoanalysis as well as the intersection and interaction between different cultural media.  Academic career  Elisabeth Bronfen studied German, English and Comparative literature at Radcliffe College and Harvard. From 1985 until 1992, she worked as an assistant at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and wrote her doctorate on Dorothy Richardson's Pilgrimage novels. Bronfen has held a chair at the University of Zurich since 1993, where she wrote her habilitation Over Her Dead Body (1992).  Works  In Over Her Dead Body (1992), Bronfen presents death as a fundamental deficit that is often negotiated over female bodies (be they dead or alive) in Western societies, citing Wuthering Heights, Frankenstein, and Vertigo. The literary and/or visual representation of death can therefore be read as a symptom of western culture, in which the female body epitomizes the Other whose death is imagined culturally. In The Knotted Subject (1998), Bronfen relates the \\"elusive, protean, and enigmatic psychosomatic disorder\\" of hysteria to cultural works by Ann Raddcliffe, Anne Sexton, Alfred Hitchcock, David Cronenberg, and Cindy Sherman. In her analysis, the human navel serves as a metaphor for both connection and detachment that is linked to the eponymous knotted subject of the hysteric because it too stems from a knot. Home in Hollywood (1999/2004) is an analysis of the portrayal of psychological processes in film classics such as Rebecca, The Wizard of Oz, and The Searchers. In particular, Bronfen traces the depiction of the Freudian Uncanny in these films. Her main thesis is that a \\"knowledge of the uncanniness of existence\\" remains visible in these movies despite their attempts of making sense of reality by giving the viewers a metaphorical home in the cinematic world. In Specters of War (2012), Bronfen analyses how Hollywood cinema and American television come to terms with US military history. From the \\"unfinished business\\" of civil war in Gone with the Wind and Gangs of New York to the \\"choreography of battle\\" in Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers, Bronfen investigates the parallels between military and cinematic spectacle. In Night Passages (2008/2013), Bronfen traces night as a trope from William Shakespeare through 19th-century realism to film noir and links the nocturnal to the primordial darkness that existed before the advent of in western culture‚Äôs \\"mythic narratives.\\" Mad Men, Death and the American Dream (2015) is an analysis of Matthew Weiner‚Äôs award-winning TV show Mad Men. According to Bronfen, the show not only successfully revives the past, but also comments on the state of the US nation and the role of the American Dream in the 20th century. In 2017, Elisabeth Bronfen's collection of essays in visual culture Crossmappings (2009) will appear in English. Therein, Bronfen proposes a reading method of the same name that is based on mapping and comparing formal aspects of cultural texts such as character constellations or political themes. According to Bronfen, this method allows for new insights into both the earlier and the later text. Rolf L√∂chel calls crossmapping a comparative method that not only uncovers intertextualities but also carves out similar concerns of texts from different media such as literature, cinema, television and painting. Amongst others, Bronfen crossmaps Charlotte Perkins Gilman‚Äôs novella The Yellow Wallpaper with the photographic oeuvre of Francesca Woodman, pop art with Baz Luhrmann‚Äôs Shakespeare adaption Romeo + Juliet, as well as Shakespeare‚Äôs Henriad with David Simon‚Äôs The Wire. In her teaching, Elisabeth Bronfen has further crossmapped Macbeth with Beau Willimon‚Äôs House of Cards and traced the rewritings of A Midsummer Night's Dream in Hollywood from Max Reinhardt‚Äôs 1935 adaption via George Cukor‚Äôs The Philadelphia Story and Howard Hawks‚Äô The Big Sleep to Susan Seidelman‚Äôs Desperately Seeking Susan.

It was once a port city on an estuary of the Nile, but is now inland of the Mediterranean Sea. In ancient times it was known as Diospolis Inferior. It has a complex of temples. History First called Smabehdet or Behdet, the Ancient Egyptian city from 2400 BC or earlier. About 1200 BC, during the New Kingdom of Egypt, it was named Paiuenamun, meaning \\"The Island of the [god] Amun\\". It was the ancient form of the name of Balamun. Tell el-Balamun, located in an agricultural area in the Nile Delta, it was a port city of an estuary of the Nile (but is now from the Mediterranean Sea due to the advance of the Nile delta). It was the site of a complex of temples. A Ramesside temple enclosure holds temples from the 26th and 30th dynasties for Nekhtnebef, Psamtik I, and Shoshenq III. There was also a cemetery for elite citizens near the temple enclosure. There was also a tomb of Iken, a Lower Egyptian Vizier, from 900 B.C. In antiquity, the stones for the temples were removed and used for other structures or burnt for lime. The city was continuously occupied until the 6th century A.D., when it was an ancient Roman city with a limestone slab paved road. Archaeological site The archaeological site, more than a kilometre in diameter, is a series of mounds up to . What survives within the site are a fortress, other mud structures, and trenches that show the walls of the temples. In 1913, Howard Carter of the Griffith Institute of the University of Oxford performed an archaeological excavation. Francis Ghattas of Mansura University carried out work in 1977 and 1978. The British Museum sponsored excavations beginning in 1991, in partnership with the Egypt Exploration Society, Polish Academy of Sciences and Polish Center for Mediterranean Archaeology. The project continued until 2010.

After serving there for 15 years, she married the French foreign minister Georges Bidault. Early life and education Borel was born in Toulon on 18 October 1904, the daughter of √âlie Borel, a graduate of the √âcole Polytechnique and a colonel assigned to the French colonies, and Louise Fontan, whose father Jules Fontan was a celebrated navy physician. Her childhood, spent in France, Senegal, Madagascar and Vietnam, included a secondary education in Dakar, Toulon, N√Æmes and Montpellier. After obtaining her baccalaur√©at in 1922, she first studied philosophy graduating in 1927. She went on to study Chinese at the √âcole des langues orientale and at the √âcole des Sciences Politiques. In February 1928, her mother sent her a newspaper cutting from Le Temps announcing a decree permitting women to take the competitive examination for entry into the diplomatic service. She had always dreamt of becoming a diplomat but it had been a career open to men only. Her first attempt at the examination was not successful but after the director of Sciences Po, Ren√© Saydoux, allowed her to participate in a special preparatory course, she succeeded in passing the examination the following year, becoming the first woman to enter France's diplomatic service. Career On entering the Foreign Ministry, Borel was informed that she would not be able to work in the many departments which were still reserved for men and was asked to sign a document confirming her understanding that she would only be permitted to work in the Paris offices of the minister. Even there, the only areas open to her would be the press, the department overseeing French participation in the League of Nations, and that regulating French works abroad, the one to which she was finally assigned. She remained there until 1944, latterly in Vichy. In her own words, \\"It was a sort of depository dealing with sports, the press and associations as well as with French charities abroad.\\" During the German occupation, Borel distinguished herself as a resistance worker. In May 1944, the Gestapo tried to arrest her, forcing her into hiding. When the war was over, Georges Bidault, the new foreign minister, invited her to work for him, promising her a post in Kiev. But it never materialized as they married in January 1946. After working independently in the diplomatic service for 15 years, she entered the traditional career of a diplomat's wife, accompanying him on trips abroad, at receptions and on election campaigns. In 1952, she took up part-time employment at the Office fran√ßais de protection des r√©fugi√©s et apatrides (French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons).

Previously elected Keeper in 2017, she was elected as the first female President of the Royal Academy of Arts in London on 10 December 2019.https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/rebecca-salter-pra-first-female- president-of-the-royal-academy Formerly a ceramicist, she is best known as painter and printmaker. Salter specialises in woodblock printing, combining Western and Eastern traditions. She has written two books on Japanese wood blocks: Japanese Woodblock (2001)Japanese Woodblock (2001) and Japanese Popular Prints: From Votive Slips to Playing Cards (2006).Japanese Popular Prints: From Votive Slips to Playing Cards (2006) Education Rebecca Salter trained at Bristol Polytechnic, graduating in 1977. According to Gillian Forrestor, George Rainer, Salter's teacher at Bristol, motivated his students to not be confined to their desired mediums, but to use the opportunity of university to experiment. Salter enjoyed the freedom to engage with mixed medias and practices, which has become an integral part of her ongoing practice. In 1979, Salter received a Leverhulme Scholarship enabling her to become a research student at Kyoto City University of Arts in Japan until 1981. She studied traditional Japanese woodblock printing with professor Kurosaki Akira. Work Salter lived and worked in Japan from 1979 to 1985. This move changed the nature of her work significantly, having an impact not only on her palette but on her artistic practice also. She began working more with two-dimensional works, creating pieces that complicate the relationship between painting, drawing, printmaking and sculpture. Her earliest, Untitled B119 (1981), is a suite of woodblock prints on paper, stained with persimmon juice, to give the impression of age, reminiscent of Japanese wab. She also studied calligraphy in the evenings, which she learnt was more than merely drawing lines but about dynamic movement. Arriving back in London, in 1985, Salter took up painting on canvas. Though she was no longer a ceramicist, she continued to view her practice as ‚Äúmaking an object‚Äù rather than a surface. Her time in Japan continued to prevail through this new medium. Calligraphic traditions can be seen through the lines in Untitled RR21 (2009), which Sadako Okhi suggests is reminiscent of a lily pond by Monet, where the lilies have been replaced by killifish. She won the Pollock-Krasner Foundation award in 1995 and the Cheltenham Open Drawing award in 1997. In 2009, Salter worked on the refurbishment of St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London, in collaboration with architects Gibberd. The refurbishment demonstrated her engagement with the Japanese concepts of space and her belief in the therapeutic value of art. Salter said: :‚ÄúFor my inspiration as to how to transform the new main entrance into a special place, I turned to aspects of Japanese art and architecture which have influenced me since studying there earlier in my career. The most important spatial concept I wanted to introduce was an intuitive way of navigating using light and texture. I hope that anyone arriving at the perimeter of the site will no longer need to study a map for directions.‚Äù Salter has twice (2003, 2011) been artist in residence at the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation, Connecticut, where she envisaged her work would be a tribute to Josef Albers‚Äô practice. Salter exhibits regularly in London, and internationally. In 2011, she had her first major museum retrospective, Into the light of things, at the Yale Center for British Art, Connecticut. It was more than a conventional retrospective of a single artist's work; it was a sustained investigation of the centrality of drawing to art making and of the notion of a dialogue between Eastern and Western aesthetics, artistic practice, and architecture. Although Salter's influence from her travels are clear, Salter prefers not to travel needlessly to reserve more time for working in her studio. Despite this, Salter does believe that artists should be able to work in any environment. =Royal Academy of Arts= In 2014, Salter was elected as a Royal Academician by the Royal Academy of Arts in London. In 2017, she was elected as Keeper of the Royal Academy, with the responsibility of guiding the RA Schools. She was elected as the first female President of the Royal Academy on 10 December 2019. She will continue to hold the position of Keeper until an election is held to appoint a new Keeper of the RA Schools in 2020.

He was also a noted farmer and stockbreeder on his estate, Hewelsfield Court, in Gloucestershire. He was born in Grindon, County Durham, England in 1804. He and his brothers John and Paul were later engaged in various railway works in England and Wales including Whiteball Tunnell on the Bristol and Exeter Railway, the South Devon Railway and the South Wales Railway. Robert Sharpe also completed works for Gloucester and Deane Forest Railway, Cornwall Railway and the Great Western Railway. In 1851, Robert had a steam powered flour and grist mill built in Chepstow, between the gas works and the railway embankment. He ran the mill in partnership with Mr. James Ireland, a cornfactor and miller from Bristol, under the name The Chepstow Steam Mill Company. The firm was successful for a number of years, but was sold in 1863 after running into difficulties. On 8 February 1860, Robert Sharpe & Sons (a partnership between Robert and his two sons Paul Wallace and William John) signed a contract with the San Paulo Railway Company, to build a line between Santos and Jundiahy, via S√£o Paulo, for the agreed sum of ¬£1,745,000. On 1 October 1866 the railway was completed, handed over to and accepted by the company. Robert Sharpe died on 25 July 1868 at Addlestone, Chertsey, Surrey, aged sixty four. He was buried at St. Margarets, West Hoathly. Chancery Court of Appeal: Sharpe v. San Paulo Railway In 1871 Paul Wallace Sharpe and William John Sharpe attempted to sue San Paulo Railway to recover additional costs of ¬£617,143 which they had incurred when the company's engineer had altered the plans from the original specification. The case reached the Chancery Court of Appeal in 1872, but was thrown out. Lord Romilly and Sir W. M. James stated that if the contractors had disapproved of the new arrangements, they ought to have entered into a fresh contract with the company. It was clear, they said, that the engineer had no power to alter the contract, and that the verbal agreement between him and contractor could not bind the company. Shortly after this, the company Robert Sharpe & Sons was dissolved.

The Texas legislature granted the college another charter on February 11, 1860, as a non-sectarian institution consolidating Waco Female Seminary and Waco Female Academy; it may also have been initially known as Waco Union Female Institute, which was chartered on February 16, 1858.Mary M. Standifer, \\"Waco Female College\\", Handbook of Texas online, June 15, 2010, retrieved March 5, 2017. Waco Female College was initially located on a square site that had been designated for a woman's college in the initial 1849 plat of Waco. A building was erected there in 1859‚Äì1860, but around 1892 the college moved to a site of about 13¬Ω acres on the outskirts of the town. The college began with preparatory (high school) and collegiate departments; facilities for boarders were added in 1872, and kindergarten and primary departments in 1883. Enrollment that year was 126, and rose to 202 in 1893. In 1890 it was listed as one of three \\"institutions for the superior instruction of women\\" in Texas.\\"Introduction by the Translator\\", Helene Lange, Higher Education of Women in Europe, tr. L.R. Klemm, Preface by T. Harris, New York: Appleton, 1890, , p. xxxii. The college charged $25 tuition per term, a $5 advance diploma fee, and $70 for boarding. It offered courses in penmanship, map- drawing, ancient and modern geography, American and world history, \\"evidences of Christianity\\", mental \\"phylosophy\\", trigonometry, astronomy, geology, botany, physiology, English, rhetoric, and Latin; all of these were required to complete a degree, except that French, German, art, or music could be substituted for Latin. Students were also required to take \\"physical culture\\". The college closed in 1895 for financial reasons; it may have been over- extended by its recent expansion and affected by the 1893 financial depression in the US. Add-Ran Christian University, a precursor of Texas Christian University, then bought the buildings and 15 acres of land from the Christian Church of Waco, which added a cash incentive and moving funds.Eric S. Ames, Waco, Images of America, Charleston, South Carolina: Arcadia, 2009, , p. 118. The university operated there until a fire in 1910, after which it relocated to Fort Worth.

It is one of the villages under Abikpi (Ebikpi) sub-clan of Eket Offiong clan. It is bounded by Afia Nsit, Ofriyo and Odoro Enen villages to the north, Ikot Ibiok and Mkpok villages to the south, Idua Village to the west and Ata Idong Ikot Usoekong village to the east.

As a part of the Abikpi Clan, Ikot Udoma people trace their migration route from the south western part of the Camerouns through Okposo in the riverine part of former Eket Local Government Area to Idung Udo village from where the Abikpi people dispersed to Ikpa village, Ndon Obong near Ikot Usoekong and Iko Eket village. From Ndon Obong the people settled at Ikot UdomaCertified True Copy of the Judgement of the High Court of South Eastern State of Nigeria in Joseph Asamudo & Anor vs Akpan Jimmy & Anor Suit No. C/3/60 and Afia Nsit villages while some people crossed the Ubium creek to Nduo Eduo and other places. People of other clans also settled at Ikot Udoma, e.g. Afaha Eket, Nnama and Abighe. Of these only Afaha Eket people are still living in the village with the Abikpi people. Composition The village is made up of four lineal groups known as \\"ekpuk\\", i.e. a group of related families tracing their origin to a common ancestor. These \\"Ekpuks\\" are Ekpuk Ndito Asamudo Nnua Edem, Ekpuk Ndito Inyang, Ekpuk Afaha Eket and Ekpuk Nung Assam Ekanim. These four \\"Ekpuks\\" are divided into ten families namely, Nung Edohoeket, Nung Nkamiang, Nung Asamudo Otu, Nung Akpedem, Nung Isonguyo and Nung Ekid Okpo (Ekpuk Ndito Asamudo Nnua Edem), Nung Inyang and Nung Ikott (Ekpuk Ndito Inyang), and Nung Assam Ekanim (Ekpuk Nung Assam Ekanim) and Nung Ekang (Ekpuk Afaha Eket). The village now has a cosmopolitan outlook which is reflected in its increased population and the varied ethnic composition. A good percentage of the population is made up of non-indigenous people who have settled in the village in the last twenty years when Eket witnessed increased population due to the expanded operations of Mobil Producing Nigeria. The village is led by a Village Head who is supported by a Town Council made up of representatives of the ten families. The current Village Head is Chief Sampson Simon Obot, a businessman and grandson of late Obong Nkamiang Asamudo Nnua Edem, Clan Head and Chief Priest of Abikpi in the nineteenth century. Chief Obot was selected by the kingmakers of the village in August 2017 but was accorded recognition by the Akwa Ibom State Government on November 7, 2019. Religion As indigenous African people, before the advent of Christianity in the area, Ikot Udoma people practised traditional African religion under which \\"Akwa Abasi Ibom Onyong\\" (meaning the Great God of Ibom who dwells on High) was recognized although sacrifices and libations were also made to a pantheon of deities and ancestors. The principal deities of the village were \\"Idim Ntied\\" for Ndito Asamudo Nnua Edem and \\"Ibit Ayu\\" for Ndito Inyang. Various cults and secret societies were widely practised and celebrated, e.g. Ekpo, Ekpe, Inam, Ekong, Idiong (for men), and Ebre and Iban Isong (for women). Slavery, human sacrifice, the killing of twins and the banishment of twin mothers were a few of the social and religious practices that the Christian Missionaries, e.g. Mary Slessor, Samuel Bill, etc and the nascent colonial administration contended with in the last decade of the nineteenth century, e.g. the colonial military expedition to the village on February 7, 1899The Twenty Years War, Invasion and Resistance in Southeastern Nigeria 1900 - 1919 by Robert D. Jackson, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1975, page 335 which led to the destruction and burning of houses and the loss of priceless elephant tusks and other valuables. Up till today, the villagers still remember the \\"white man's\\" war and the atrocities that were committed.Certified True Copy of the Judgement of the Eket District Court in Civil Suit No. 412/53 between Wilson Asam Udo & Edward Nkamiang Asam Udo vs Udo Nkamiang Udo Ntuen & Ekong Nkamiang With the advent of Christianity arising from the founding of Qua Iboe Church by the Rev Samuel Alexander Bill at Ibeno in 1888, Ikot Udoma became a bastion of Christianity early in the twentieth century, especially with the establishment of Qua Iboe Church in Ofriyo village which served the four neighbouring villages - Ofriyo, Ikot Udoma, Odoro Enen and Afia Nsit commonly known as Idong Iniang (Four Towns). Today the village has many churches and ministries, namely, Qua Iboe Church, Faith Terbanacle Congregation, Christ Apostolic Church, The Church of Christ, Assemblies of God Church, Mount Zion Lighthouse Full Gospel Church, The Apostolic Church, The Redeemed Christian Church of God, Glory world International Gospel Centre, Abundance Life Ministries, etc. Education The first school in the area was the Primary School established by the Qua Iboe Church, Ofriyo which served the four villages. The School was taken over by the Eket County Council in 1964 and is now known as Primary School, Idiong Iniang, to reflect the commitment of the four villages to its existence and progress. The first school to be sited in Ikot Udoma Village was the UPE School along Ikot Ibiok Road which was established by the Eastern Regional Government in 1957. The Universal Primary Education (UPE) programme of the Eastern Nigerian Government failed and this school did not grow beyond Standard 5 before it was downgraded to the status of a Junior Primary School (Primary 1 to Primary 3).It was merged with Primary School, Idong Iniang, in the early 1970's. The site of this historic school has since been re-possessed by some of the villagers. The village now has several Secondary and Nursery/Primary schools, e.g. Community Secondary School, Idong Iniang (jointly established by the Idong Iniang Welfare Association and the four villages of Idong Iniang), Excellent Comprehensive Secondary School, Dayspring High School, Donema Nursery School, Victina International School, MC Prime Montessori Nursery School, etc. Health Care The only government-owned health facility in the area is the Polyclinic at Afia Nsit village which is run by the Eket Local Government. Commercial Activities Several business undertakings provide catering services, entertainment and relaxation, e.g. Modern City Guest House, Tinkle Fast Food, Octagon Event Centre, etc. The IDEMGH-LINK GROUP OF COMPANIES has recently established in the community to provide services in the oil industry. Numerous small-scale shops and stores in the village anchor commercial activities but there are also locked up stores at Udua Obo which used to be a daily evening market patronized by the four villages up to the 1980's. Ikot Udoma used to be the home of By the Grace of God Motors, which operated luxury bus services between Eket/Ikot Abasi and Lagos. The company has since closed down.

She was born in 1590 in either Seville or Granada and died in Seville on 6 November 1646.Juana Escabias, \\"Ana Mar√≠a Caro Mall√©n de Torres, una esclava en los corrales de comedias del siglo XVII,\\" Epos. Revista de Filologia 28 (2012)  Life  Her full name is Ana Mar√≠a Caro de Mall√©n y Torres. Her parents were Gabriel Caro de Mall√©n and Ana Mar√≠a de Torres. They were actually her adopted parents, since she was born as a morisco slave. It is thought that she was the sister of Don Juan Caro de Mall√©n y Soto, born in Granada.  Career  Caro de Mall√©n's career took off in 1628 when she published poetry as well as studies on festivals and cultural activities. She had moved to Madrid by 1637 when she published Contexto de las reales fiestas madrile√±as del Buen Retiro. She was a friend of the famous novelist Maria de Zayas and was recognized by many of her male counterparts including Juan de Matos Fragoso and Luis V√©lez de Guevara. She earned money from some of her works of poetry and from her theater and is thus considered one of the first professional women writers Lola Luna. \\"Ana Caro, una escritora ‚Äòde oficio‚Äô del Siglo de Oro,\\" Bulletin of Hispanic Studies, Jan 1,1995; 72, 1, pp. 11-26. Ana Caro was the author of two religious plays (in Spanish, autos sacramentales) as well as a number of entremeses, which are short interlude plays placed between acts of comedias. Two of her entremeses survive, A loa sacramental and Coloquio entre dos. Only two of Caro de Mall√©n's full-length plays are known today, El conde partinupl√©s and Valor, agravio y mujer (Courage, Betrayal, and a Woman Scorned).  Writing Style  Being that Caro de Mall√©n was a poet, a poetic style of writing shone through in her dramas. She was known for writing dialogue that included single stanza verse shifts between characters that were made up largely of exchanges of metaphor. Many consider the bantering style of Caro de Mall√©n's plays witty. The majority of her plays include a wide range of characters, from servant characters who speak in low-brow humor to characters born of nobility. Through her comedic plays Caro de Mall√©n made comments on the social and political realities of 17th century Spain. Popular thematic ideas that are present in Caro de Mall√©n's work are revenge, honor, intrigue, and love triangles.
