Also known as Dede Bandaid, Dede‚Äôs work is well known for his widespread use of images of band-aids. Biography Dede was born and raised in Tel Aviv, Israel. He was first exposed to graffiti art in his youth and at the age of 13 spray-painted a map of the Milky Way galaxy on the walls of his school. During his military service in the Israel Defense Forces, Dede began doing graffiti which included visual messages that were implicitly anti-establishment. These included childlike soldiers making soap bubbles, as well as policemen wearing ballerina outfits. After his release from the army, Dede often sprayed stencils of peace doves, large mutant animals, architecture etc. as a way of communicating social and political ideas. Finding inspiration in current day issues, Dede began, in 2008, to reflect on contemporary events in Israel. Such were 2011 Israeli social justice protests, the Israeli housing crisis, Crony capitalism and homelessness. Dede‚Äôs works are mostly displayed in the public realm though he avoids pure acts of vandalism. Dede began displaying his work in Israeli galleries and museums in 2009 including Kishon Gallery, Alfred Gallery, P8, Tzadik Gallery, Zemack Gallery, Fresh Paint Art Fair, Ein-Hod Museum, Haifa Museum and more. He has also shown in galleries in Switzerland, Italy, France, New York, Germany and others. Work Dede‚Äôs early work entailed widespread stencil use. He has evolved in his style to free-style drawing and wheat pasting. A recurring theme in his work is the band-aid. The reason for Dede‚Äôs repeated use of the band-aid is unclear, and the artist himself has avoided giving it a precise meaning. Dede gained much public attention for using large-scale elements in the public arena, turning them to iconic pieces of art, as if pointing at a relevant social or current affair for the public to pay attention to. Such examples were turning one of the Ayalon Highway intersections into a Yellow Submarine (album);http://blog.globalstreetart.com/post/42586613388/yellow-submarine-by- dede-in-tel-aviv-clever-way turning an abandoned part of bridge into a cloth- pin;http://www.streetartnews.net/2013/11/dede-new-street-piece-tel-aviv- israel.html and turning a big empty parking lot into a missile target during the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict.http://www.isupportstreetart.com/dede-draws-a- bomb-target/ One of Dede's unique artworks which has attracted special attention was at the abandoned Dulphinarium in Tel-Aviv, notoriously known for the Dolphinarium discotheque suicide bombing, turning the sea-facing front of the structure into a Chattery Teeth, possibly being the biggest illegal piece of art in Israel.http://www.haaretz.com/life/arts- leisure/1.657798http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/education/.premium-1.2620808  Gallery  Image:Dede Wind Up Teeth.jpgOriginal artwork by Dede at the abandoned Dolphinarium, Tel-Aviv, 2015.

It was founded in Germany in 2006.Michael von Wolff, Markus Montag: 6 Jahre FertiPROTEKT ‚Äì Eine Zwischenbilanz. Gyn√§kologische Endokrinologie. 2 (2012), 86-90, . (in German language) The network now extends to all German-speaking countries and currently units ca. 100 institutions in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.  Aims  The aim of the network is to offer men and women the possibility of seeking advice about scientific information regarding their fertility before and after Chemo- or radiotherapy, and to undergo procedures to protect their fertility. The advice about and the performance of fertility-conserving procedures according to the network‚Äôs code of ethics is non-profit oriented.Fertiprotekt network‚Äôs code of ethics (in German language)  Background  As a result of today‚Äôs significantly improved prognosis for patients with cancer, quality of life is increasingly important after overcoming treatment of the disease. Fears about fertility preservation play an important role for young men and women. The most common types of cancer diagnosed under the age of 40 years are breast cancer, melanoma, cervical cancer, non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma and leukaemia. One of the biggest problems in women who have to undergo chemo- or radiotherapy is premature ovarian failure (premature ovarian insufficiency) and its associated infertility.Matthias W. Beckmann, Helge Binder, Ralf Dittrich, Klaus Friese, Bernd Gerber, Gerald Gitsch, Walter Jonat, Manfred Kaufmann, Marion Kiechle, Rolf Kreienberg, Klaus Diedrich, Diethelm Wallwiener, Martin Wilhelm, Wolfgang W√ºrfel, Olaf Ortmann: Konzeptpapier zur Ovarprotektion. Frauenarzt 47 (2006), p. 604-616, online (PDF; 214 kB) (in German language) For breast cancer alone, it is assumed that there are ca. 200 patients a year in Germany who wish to conceive. In men, chemotherapy can result in permanent damage to the testicular tissue. Due to advances in reproductive medicine, a variety of fertility-protective methods are now available. These techniques include administration of GnRH-agonists, ovarian stimulation with cryoconservation of fertilised or unfertilised oocytes, as well as cryoconservation of ovarian tissue. Relocation of the ovaries by surgically moving them out of the pelvis (ovarian transposition) to protect them from damage caused by radiotherapy is also possible.  Activity  The Fertiprotekt network has carried out international pioneering work in four areas: * National, comprehensive care structures in the area of fertility conservation have been created, which also serve as a role model for other countries. * Treatment recommendations have been created, which allow a standardised and scientific approach.Michael von Wolff, Markus Montag, Ralf Dittrich, Dominik Denschlag, Frank Nawroth, Barbara Lawrenz: Fertility preservation in women - a practical guide to preservation techniques and therapeutic strategies in breast cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma and borderline ovarian tumours by the fertility preservation network FertiPROTEKT. Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics, 284 (2011), pp. 427-435, . * So-called luteal phase stimulation has been introduced, which allows hormonal stimulation to collect oocytes to be started at any time during the menstrual cycle. The procedure of egg-cell collection is therefore considerably shortened, and chemotherapy can be started earlier.Michael von Wolff, Christian J. Thaler, Torsten Frambach, Cosima Zeeb, Barbara Lawrenz, Roxana M. Popovici, Thomas Strowitzki: Ovarian stimulation to cryopreserve fertilized oocytes in cancer patients can be started in the luteal phase. Fertil Steril. 92 (2009), pp. 1360-5, . * The combination of ovarian tissue cryopreservation, directly followed by hormonal stimulation to collect egg cells for oocyte cryopreservation was first performed by centres in the network. This technique allows a significant increase in the chance of pregnancy.Cosima Huober-Zeeb, Barbara Lawrenz, Roxana M. Popovici, Thomas Strowitzki, Ariane Germeyer, Petra Stute, Michael von Wolff: Improving fertility preservation in cancer, ovarian tissue cryobanking followed by ovarian stimulation can be efficiently combined. Fertil Steril. 95 (2011), pp. 342-4, . * The first birth after transposition of ovarian tissue, which was transported to a central cryobank by overnight transport immediately after removal, was achieved by the network. This demonstrated that removed ovarian tissue can be centrally prepared and stored in specialised centres.Ralf Dittrich, Laura Lotz, Gudrun Keck, Inge Hoffmann, Andreas Mueller, Matthias W. Beckmann, Hans van der Ven, Markus Montag: Live birth after ovarian tissue autotransplantation following overnight transportation before cryopreservation. Fertil Steril. 97 (2012), pp. 387-90, .Andreas M√ºller, Katja Keller, Jennifer Wacker, Ralf Dittrich, Gudrun Keck, Markus Montag, Hans van der Ven, David Wachter, Matthias W. Beckmann, Wolfgang Distler: Retransplantation of Cryopreserved Ovarian Tissue: the First Live Birth in Germany. Dtsch Arztebl Int 109 (2012), pp. 8-13, . Network seminars take place annually. The centres involved are obliged to regularly take part in these annual conferences.  Problems  Some methods, such as cryoconservation of sperm and in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) are well established. Others have only been introduced over the last few years, such as cryoconservation of ovarian tissue prior to chemotherapy for later transplantation and the cryoconservation of unfertilized egg cells. These services are therefore not fully covered by statutory health insurance in Germany.Kinderwunsch und Krebs.

Blackpaper is published on every 1st and 15th of each month, sold at 7-Eleven only. The magazine is printed on an A5 paper and folded into half. In 2010, it achieved 160 thousand copies in Hong Kong. Besides magazine, nowadays Blackpaper extends their business into merchandises like T-shirt and books.Penny, Z. (11 February 2010). Upclose with Black Paper . HK Magazine. Retrieved 21 March 2014, from http://hk-magazine.com/events/article/upclose-black-paper. The magazine ceased its publication in 1 January 2017. Rationale of Blackpaper  Blackpaper publishes content in short for the local new generation, mostly post-80s and post-90s, in order to encourage them to read more. It features celebrities as cover person, especially from the local entertainment sphere. Sometimes, they would invite political figures.  Changes of Blackpaper throughout the years  Each year, the main theme of Blackpaper changes but it mainly contains ‚Äòblack interview‚Äô (interviews with celebrities), ‚Äôblack survey‚Äô (results of survey related to the theme of that issue) and ‚Äòblack sentence‚Äô (sarcastic sentences based on the theme of that issue). =2010 Faux Literature Magazine (ÂÅΩÊñáÂ≠∏ÈõúË™å)= Every issue was titled with a single word and only ‚Äòblack sentence‚Äô as its contents. There was no limit on the colour tone. =2011 Faux Entertainment Magazine(ÂÅΩÂ®õÊ®ÇÈõúË™å)= Every issue was titled with a single word, with ‚Äòblack sentence‚Äô and ‚Äòblack interview‚Äô. The cover was in greyscale, including the portraits of the interviewees in ‚Äòblack interview‚Äô. =2012 Faux Advertisement Magazine(ÂÅΩÂª£ÂëäÈõúË™å)= Every issue was titled with a two-word vocabulary. Most of the issues were composed of ‚Äòblack sentence‚Äô and ‚Äòblack interview‚Äô. Some of them were composed with other kinds of verbal creation, such as drafts and graphics. On the covers, portraits of interviewees were in greyscale and the title is in colour. =2013 Faux Love (Romantic) Magazine(ÂÅΩÊÑõÊÉÖÈõúË™å)= The titles of the issues started by ‚ÄòHate‚Ä¶the most‚Äô, such as ‚ÄòHate hypocrites the most‚Äô, in local film director Wong Jing‚Äôs issue. Issues were composed of ‚Äòblack sentence‚Äô, ‚Äòblack interview‚Äô and ‚Äòblack statistic‚Äô. The covers are printed in colour, but the interviewees‚Äô full length photos are in greyscale. =2014 Faux Times Magazine(ÂÅΩÊôÇ‰ª£ÈõúË™å)= The titles of the issues were ‚ÄòMan of the ‚Ä¶‚Äô, such as ‚ÄòMan of Cantonese‚Äô. Every issue was composed of ‚Äòblack sentence‚Äô and ‚Äòblack interview‚Äô. Covers were printed with the profile shots of the interviewees in colour. =Special Edition (September 2012)= This edition features the 11 reasons why the Moral and National Education has to be retracted. The issue was distributed in the related protest at the Central Government Complex, Tamar, Hong Kong. Issues related to political affairs Topics related to Hong Kong politics are their main focus, especially on June Forth event and election in Hong Kong. Every year, Blackpaper titles ‚ÄòJune Fourth‚Äô(ÂÖ≠Âõõ), the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, as its first issue of June, in order to remind the public to struggle for the rehabilitation of victims. Young generation can also get to know more about the incident. After the Hong Kong Chief Executive election of 2012, Blackpaper published an issue with a single word,‚ÄòDarkness‚Äô(ÈªëÊöó), expressing the distrust towards Leung Chun-ying, the new Chief Executive. Moreover, another issue published in August 2012 disapproved the 2012 Hong Kong legislative election. Blackpaper was in attempt to call for a fair electoral system, a universal suffrage in Hong Kong.  Influence  = Politics = Some celebrities from the celebrities from local entertainment sphere were asked about the issues happened in Hong Kong Society. For instance, Mag Lam, a local diva, expressed her opinion towards education in Hong Kong. As young adults treated those celebrities as their idols, through this celebrity effect, Blackpaper aroused teenagers‚Äô interest in politics in a certain extent. Blackpaper was even used in protest, which directly shows its influence in Hong Kong politics. During the protest against Moral and National Education in Hong Kong in 2012, the founders of Blackpaper issued a special edition of Blackpaper, with the word ‚ÄòRetract‚Äô(Êí§Âõû) printed on it. Copies of this issue of Blackpaper were distributed to protesters outside the Central Government Complex on 7 September. Members and supporters of Scholarism (Â≠∏Ê∞ëÊÄùÊΩÆ) held up the Blackpaper during the protest , showing their determination. Some students even put Blackpaper on their school bulletin board so as to show their concerns on the controversy to schools. During the debate of Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2011 in Hong Kong, which the public treated as Internet Article 23, Blackpaper published an issue called ‚ÄòParody‚Äô(ÊÉ°Êêû), with some paper glasses attached to that issue. It invited readers to wear them as real glasses. Later, many people posted photos of their recreated images with the paper glasses on Facebook, including local artist, Shawn Yue and the member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, James Tien Pei-chun. As people who joined the event actually involved in the creation of derivative works, this show their support towards derivative works. = Culture = Derivative works Due to its success among teenagers, many derivative works of Blackpaper started to appear. People took its style and design as reference and created various ‚Äòfraux-Blackpaper‚Äô to attract teenagers. For example, souvenirs distributed by Beacon College‚Äôs tutor Yat Yan Lam and dessert recipes in local convenience stores. Language Blackpaper used Cantonese and words commonly known among teenagers like‚Äòplastic‚Äô(ËÜ†) and‚Äòblow‚Äô(Âêπ), which are vulgar sometimes. This further spreads and consolidates the usage of those words in society. Criticism on Black Paper The deliberate short length in each issue led to criticism by netizens on Blackpaper and 100most, another megazine that was also founded by the founders, that these magazines will degrade teenagers‚Äô ability in writing long article. However, the founder responded that they only aimed at helping readers to become a person who pays more attention to the society and self through reading the Blackpaper.

Plot Will Rogers, the despotic patriarch of a wealthy cattle ranching family, forces the sheep farming Caine brothers - Ben, Thomas, and Eli - to sell off their livestock. In retaliation, the Caines steal a shipment of gold coins intended for the Rogers; during their escape, Ben is wounded. Thomas and Eli ride to their ranch, while Ben, upon returning to his home, is ambushed by the Rogers and lynched as his wife, Maria, is forced by Will's sons to watch. The Rogers then ride to Thomas and Eli's ranch and burn down their house. The brothers ride to Maria's home to find her burying her husband, and give her a third-share of the stolen money. Driven by revenge, Maria take the money to a ghost town surrounded by dunes, where she meets its lone inhabitant, Manuel. A gunfighter with a fetishistic habit of wearing a black leather glove in duels, Manuel had once shared a romantic relationship with Maria and a friendship with Ben, but he left the pair to marry in order to suppress his violent nature. Maria asks him to avenge Ben on her behalf - although reluctant and sceptical, Manuel accepts her offer. Manuel rides to a nearby town and stays at a hotel that Will's sons frequent. In the saloon, vigilantes from the rival Vallee family confront and attack the Rogers brothers in an attempt to run them out of town; Manuel kills the Vallees, and is quickly arrested. The next morning, the Rogers brothers bribe the sheriff into releasing Manuel, and take him to the family ranch. Thankful for saving his sons, Will provides Manuel a job as the ranch's foreman. That night, Manuel dines with the Rogers and their ranch hands, during which he opens a jar of mustard to find a jack-in-the-box, resulting in both dinner tables erupting with laughter as they accept him as their friend. Later, Manuel opens the ranch's corral and frees the horses; during the commotion as the Rogers try to pursue their mounts, he kidnaps Diana, Will's teenage daughter, and takes her to the ghost town. Thomas and Eli rape Diana, while Maria and Manuel, growing increasingly impassioned and uncomfortable with the situation that is transpiring, wait outside in the street. Maria rides to the Rogers ranch and demands that they re-bury Ben in the town cemetery in exchange for Diana's life. They begrudgingly accept, and provide Ben with a sizeable funeral procession and burial. Thomas and Eli, fearing that Maria's revenge scheme will result in disaster, attempt to convince Manuel to surrender Diana to them, but they are forced to leave when he threatens to kill them. The Rogers capture the Caine brothers; in exchange for $2000, Thomas offers to return Diana to her family that night. His attempt to surprise Maria and Manuel fails, and they shoot him. Thomas' horse drags his dead body to the rendezvous point, where Eli confesses that Diana is in the ghost town. Upon learning this, Will has him dragged to death by a horse. Maria and Manuel leave the ghost town separately; Manuel takes Diana back to her family's ranch, while Maria returns to her home to wait for Manuel so that they can travel north and escape. However, the Rogers, believing that she and Manuel have killed Diana, are waiting for her. Manuel finds Maria mortally wounded; admitting that she had married Ben out of fear of not seeing Manuel again, she dies in his arms. Manuel rides to the ghost town to see the Rogers waiting for him on one side of the street, and he guns them down in quick succession. Diana, on horseback and armed with a rifle, witnesses the duel. Manuel removes his \\"killing glove\\", disarms himself and confronts Diana, who shoots him and rides away as he collapses onto the sand and dies.

The film was released by Arrow Video in the United Kingdom and United States on Blu-Ray and DVD on July 20, 2015. Reception From retrospective reviews, Alex Cox discussed the film in Film Comment, stating that the film \\"holds its own against art westerns like Once Upon a Time in the West and El Topo\\" specifically noting Henri Persin's cinematography and Jean Mandaroux's production design. James Blackford discussed the release in Film Comment, stating that where \\"Leone exaggerated the western's traits with virtuoso style and grandiouse mise en scene, Hossein's approach is more to distill the genre.\\" Blackford compared the film to the work of Jean-Pierre Melville, noting the film was \\"marked by long periods without dialogue and an intense focus on essential images. In this filmic space, every pronounced camera movement, musical cue and look exchanged by the characters heightens the melodrama. The result is a compellingly pure take on the western, true to the tradition of French popular cinema.\\" Notes =References=  External links Cemetery without Crosses at Allmovie Category:Spaghetti Western films Category:1969 Western (genre) films Category:French Western (genre) films Category:Italian Western (genre) films Category:Italian films Category:French films Category:1969 films Category:Films shot in Almer√≠a ","title":"Cemetery Without Crosses"},{"id":"42368276","text":"The Interactive Institute (also known as Interactive Institute Swedish ICT) is an experimental research institute in the fields of information and communications technology, interaction design, and visualization, operating in Sweden.

It was built between 1710 and 1712 by the architect Thomas Archer. Archer built Roehampton House on behalf of the merchant Thomas Cary. Cary's father, John, emigrated to the Colony of Virginia in 1663, and Cary was born there in 1669. Both returned to London and by 1690 were running an import and export trading business. From 1910 to 1913, Sir Edwin Lutyens made some alterations to the main house and added north and south wings. Historic England note that these were \\"a continuation of the Archer style and to a plan close to Archer's original intentions\\", and that \\"the Lutyens parts would in themselves merit Grade II*\\". From 1915 to 1983 the house was occupied by Queen Mary's Hospital. In 2010 Berkeley Group Holdings began work to convert the property into 24 apartments and houses.

The film was critically acclaimed upon release and won laurels at the Karnataka State Film Awards. It was also a major commercial success heightening the popularity of Devaraj in action hero roles. Editor R. Janardhan was awarded with Best Editing and Thriller Manju was awarded for his action stunts. The film was widely famous for its action scenes and became a trendsetter for action films in Sandalwood. The film was dubbed in Telugu with same name.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1qnloaaFS4  Plot  When a group of young graduates stand anxiously in a que for attending an important job interview , a young man elaborates about how money is necessary to get a job and asks them to go away only to be beaten by them. The story cuts to Kumar who aspires to be a police officer. His mother, Janaki, mortgages her house, the only property they have, so as to bribe Minister Mahadevayya who have offered him a job. Kumar has a circle of friends who are thick as thieves. Of them only Amar is employed as he unwilling to bribe anyone has opened a workshop for vehicles. The other three - TK, Giri and Soori are unemployed graduates who spends time attending interviews and partying in Amar's money. Amar's cousin Aasha has a deep crush on him and supports him at difficult times. One night Kumar travels to the minister's house only for the latter to renege upon his word causing an incensed Kumar to assault him. He is arrested by the minister's close aid Circle Inspector Rajasekhar. Inspector uses third degree torture to make a reluctant Kumar sign some papers leading to his death. With the help of Marimuthu, a local rowdy, they bury his corpse. However, Amar, who has already been into a fight with Marimuthu gets to know about this from the latter and takes him to Superindent of Police Lakshman. The next day in the court Advocate Kabinipathi who defends the minister and the Inspector accuses Amar of the murder with the fake evidences planted by the corrupt Superindent supporting the claim. He is given a life imprisonment. It is revealed that Marimuthu was killed so as to hide the truth. Unable to face the humiliation and octracism , Amar's mother and sister commits suicide. While he is taken to perform their last rites, he kills Lakshman and in return is brutally tortured in the prison by Rajasekhar. The next day when he is taken to the hospital his friends rescue him. However, Giri gets killed in the process. Amar is taken to a secret hideout where he after initial opposition agrees to make his friends and Asha part of his vengeance crusade. Taking the alias of Janma who has achieved Punarjanma (Reincarnation) he threatens to kill his rivals. He first kills Lawyer Kabinipathi and hangs him before court. The pressure of the case mounts upon Commissioner Venkataramayya who gives an ultimatum for Rajasekhar. An enraged Rajasekhar goes with a battalion to Amar's old housing colony in Shantipura and thrashes the innocent people. Amar's uncle criticises them for not believing in Amar and then leads them in a violent rebellion against the police officers. They barge into the station and beat the officers until stopped by Venkataramayya who after coming to know about what happened in the colony feels humiliated and suspends Rajasekhar. He also understands Amar's innocence and declares how he doubt the involvement of the minister in Kumar's custodial death forcing the latter to resign from his post. Meanwhile, Rajasekhar along with a few hooligans raid Amar's safe house and captures his friends. Amar after a long fight rescues them and impales Rajasekhar to his death. Venkataramayya beefs up the security outside Mahadevayya's house. However, Soori manages to lure them away by posing as a sniper while Amar defeats the ex-minister's bodyguards. Before he can kill Mahadevayya he is captured by the police. The story shifts to the Uccha Nyayalaya where the prosecutor advocates for capital punishment to battle criminals like Amar when he bursts out about how he became Janma with the law having equal role in it. He mentions about how the blindfolded justice cannot understand the unseen anecdotes behind crimes. Even Venkataramayya threatens to quit his job if the court doesn't serve Amar justice after placing his gun and belt on the Judge's bench. Just about when the Judge is about to read his verdict (possibly negative as poetic justice is not practical) the young man from the beginning of the film who was also a victim of the minister's deceit takes the gun from Judge's bench and murders the ex-minister with all others standing in incredulity.

Founding member and original drummer Kyle Wesolowski took a trip to New Orleans, Louisiana a couple years after Hurricane Katrina hit the city. After driving through the neighborhoods & witnessing the devastation & destruction it brought to the city it spawned the name Years Since the Storm. Soon after Years Since the Storm became an official band, Eric Snapper was recruited by Kyle to play for the band. =\\"To The Clouds\\" EP (2010 - 2012)= After playing countless amounts of local shows in support of \\"Left Floating In the Sea\\" and continuing through several member changes, the group started to write music again. With this came the release of the single \\"Still Waters\\" in October 2010. They continued to write and later hit the studio with Zakk Cervini, producing the 6 song EP entitled \\"To The Clouds,\\" released November 2011. The group gained fans regionally and nationally and began to tour the east coast in an attempt to build an even larger fan-base.

A number of different approaches exist for Robust PCA, including an idealized version of Robust PCA, which aims to recover a low-rank matrix L0 from highly corrupted measurements M = L0 +S0. This decomposition in low-rank and sparse matrices can be achieved by techniques such as Principal Component Pursuit method (PCP), Stable PCP, Quantized PCP, Block based PCP, and Local PCP. Then, optimization methods are used such as the Augmented Lagrange Multiplier Method (ALM), Alternating Direction Method (ADM), Fast Alternating Minimization (FAM), Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS ) or alternating projections (AP). Algorithms =Non-convex method= The state-of-the-art guaranteed algorithm for the robust PCA problem (with the input matrix being M=L+S) is an alternating minimization type algorithm. The computational complexity is O\\\\left(m n r^2 \\\\log\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon} \\\\right) where the input is the superposition of a low-rank (of rank r) and a sparse matrix of dimension m \\\\times n and \\\\epsilon is the desired accuracy of the recovered solution, i.e., \\\\ \\\\widehat{L}-L \\\\_F \\\\leq \\\\epsilon where L is the true low-rank component and \\\\widehat{L} is the estimated or recovered low-rank component. Intuitively, this algorithm performs projections of the residual on to the set of low-rank matrices (via the SVD operation) and sparse matrices (via entry-wise hard thresholding) in an alternating manner - that is, low-rank projection of the difference the input matrix and the sparse matrix obtained at a given iteration followed by sparse projection of the difference of the input matrix and the low-rank matrix obtained in the previous step, and iterating the two steps until convergence. This alternating minimization algorithm is later improved by an accelerated version. The acceleration is achieved by applying a tangent space projection before project the residue onto the set of low-rank matrices. This trick improves the computational complexity to O\\\\left(m n r \\\\log\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon} \\\\right) with a much smaller constant in front while it maintains the theoretically guaranteed linear convergence. =Convex relaxation= This method consists of relaxing the rank constraint rank(L) in the optimization problem to the nuclear norm \\\\L\\\\_* and the sparsity constraint \\\\S\\\\_0 to \\\\ell_1-norm \\\\S\\\\_1. The resulting program can be solved using methods such as the method of Augmented Lagrange Multipliers.  Applications  RPCA has many real life important applications particularly when the data under study can naturally be modeled as a low-rank plus a sparse contribution. Following examples are inspired by contemporary challenges in computer science, and depending on the applications, either the low-rank component or the sparse component could be the object of interest: = Video surveillance = Given a sequence of surveillance video frames, it is often required to identify the activities that stand out from the background. If we stack the video frames as columns of a matrix M, then the low-rank component L0 naturally corresponds to the stationary background and the sparse component S0 captures the moving objects in the foreground. = Face recognition = Images of a convex, Lambertian surface under varying illuminations span a low- dimensional subspace. This is one of the reasons for effectiveness of low- dimensional models for imagery data. In particular, it is easy to approximate images of a human's face by a low-dimensional subspace. To be able to correctly retrieve this subspace is crucial in many applications such as face recognition and alignment. It turns out that RPCA can be applied successfully to this problem to exactly recover the face.

Hickson created eight monologues ready to air at Edinburgh's Fringe Festival in August 2008. These monologue (of 15 minutes each) offer a state-of-the-nation group portrait. The official website for the performance describes it as \\"looking at what has happened to a generation that have grown up in a world where everything has become acceptable.\\" Eight was formed around the results of a survey that asked twenty-somethings what defined their generation; Hickson tried to answer their almost unanimous response of ‚Äòapathy‚Äô, with a show that works to find the glimmers of faith amidst wholesale cynicism. Eight looks at the singular, personal effect of an otherwise social phenomenon.  Performances  For each performance, the audience was asked to vote for which four of the eight monologues they would like to see. As the audience entered the auditorium, all eight characters were lined up across the front of the stage - but only the four characters with the highest votes would perform. The other four characters would remain onstage, reminding the audience that in each choice we make we are also choosing to leave something behind. Such a procedure is not essential for a performance of Eight and directors, of course, should remain in control of the line-up and order of play if they should so wish. = Edinburgh Fringe = In May 2008, the director, writer, cast and crew of Eight were all students/alumni of Edinburgh University. The group applied for the free Fringe slot offered, each year, to a student production by Edinburgh University Theatre Company at the Bedlam Theatre. Three months later, the show was performed and went on to win a Fringe First, the Carol Tambor Best of Edinburgh Award, and The NSDF Emerging Artists Award. The NSDF Emerging Artists Award facilitated a three-night run of ‚ÄòEight‚Äô at The Pleasance Theatre, Islington ‚Äì which took place in October 2008. = New York = The Carol Tambor ‚ÄòBest of Edinburgh‚Äô Award, is an award given to only one of the thousands of shows across the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. This award offered an all expenses paid two week run at New York‚Äôs PS122. The New York debut of Eight coincided with New York's two largest off-Broadway festivals ‚Äì the Under The Radar Festival; a showcase of new international work held at The Public Theatre and The COIL Festival ‚Äì held at Eight's own venue PS122. Eight was hugely successful in its run - performing sold out shows near enough every performance. \\"Ms. Hickson, 23, has already found her voice ‚Äî and it‚Äôs a powerful one; a potent show indeed\\" - The New York Times = London = After the success of Eight at Edinburgh and New York, Eight was performed at the Trafalgar Studios, London from the 6th, until 25 July 2009. The run included after-show talks of the \\"new writing, Fringe preparation and how to make it as a new‚Äê kid in the theatre world\\". = Amateur Rights = The script was published 2 July 2009 through Nick Hern Books and featured a ninth monologue only performed once before. This ninth monologue was the first of these to be written. It was performed by Henry Peters at a scratch night called Candlewasters at Bedlam Theatre, Edinburgh, early 2008. Hickson Explains \\"Buttons was left out of the final line-up of Eight because his syndrome was too niche to appeal to the wide demographic at the Fringe - he was a little too weird. I am, however, incredibly fond and proud of this monologue; this ninth man, is, after all, where it all began.\\"  Characters  Below are descriptions of each character as they appeared in the published book: *Danny, twenty-two *Jude, eighteen *Andr√©, twenty-eight *Bobby, twenty-two *Mona, eighteen *Miles, twenty-seven *Millie, thirty *Astrid, twenty-four *(Buttons, mid-thirties) = Danny = Danny is a well-built man in his early twenties. He sits on a black box in the centre of the stage with a corpse's head lain across his knee, he is feeding water to the corpse. He is wearing jeans, a black wife-beater, and black boots. Danny is twenty-two years old but he appears much younger; his learnt manner is one of faux aggression; however, he fails to disguise an underlying vulnerability. Danny is a little slow but essentially sweet. = Jude = Jude is Eighteen years old, dressed in school trousers, shirt and tie. A large black block, centre stage, acts as a bed and a dinner table - navigated around in the opening sections. = Andr√© = Andr√©, originally Andrew, is a twenty-eight-year-old gallery owner. He enters his gallery, clearly stricken, takes a moment to catch his breath and position himself on a high stool. = Bobby = Bobby is a twenty-two-year-old mother of two - wearing a red Adidas tracksuit. She is seated on a table. We imagine her kids, Kyle and Chlo√´, four and six, at her feet in front of the telly. She's reading down to them in enthusiasm. Bobby has a strong, working-class Edinburgh accent, she mimics an upper-middle-class English accent when impersonating Mrs Beeton. = Mona = Mona is a small, dark-haired girl in her late teens, with a mild pregnancy bump that is not seen immediately. Her hair is loose around her face; she has the innocence of youth and yet acts with disquieting intensity. The stage is set with a centre block and one chair placed at its side. = Miles = Miles is an American man in his mid- twenties. He is dressed in a sharp suit and is attractive due to a corporate aesthetic. He should carry himself with ultimate bodily and vocal composure. The cracks in this composure should be perfectly synchronised with the glimpses of weakness in his performative fa√ßade. = Millie = Millie is an apparently well-to-do lady, in her early thirties, dressed in tennis whites and wielding a tennis racket. She is mid-mime, straddling an imaginary middle- aged man, flailing wildly... = Astrid = Astrid is in her early twenties. She is slim and attractive, the kind of girl that seems comfortable in her own skin. Tonight, however, she is a little drunk. She is returning from a night out and is dressed accordingly.

Alternatively, it is a hierarchical generative model for deep learning, which is highly effective in image processing and object recognition, though it has been used in other domains too. The salient features of the model include the fact that it scales well to high-dimensional images and is translation-invariant. CDBNs use the technique of probabilistic max-pooling to reduce the dimensions in higher layers in the network. Training of the network involves a pre-training stage accomplished in a greedy layer-wise manner, similar to other deep belief networks. Depending on whether the network is to be used for discrimination or generative tasks, it is then \\"fine tuned\\" or trained with either back- propagation or the up‚Äìdown algorithm (contrastive‚Äìdivergence), respectively.

A beneficiary fund is a uniquely South African entity designed to accept and administer lump sum death benefits allocated in their discretion by retirement fund trustees to the minor dependants of deceased retirement fund members, as set out in section 37C of the Act. Major dependants are also eligible to accept section 37C death benefits. Beneficiary funds were introduced in January 2009. Advantages of beneficiary funds are that they are cost effective and tax effective, and offer institutional investment returns. Beneficiary funds are taxed in the same manner as retirement funds in South Africa, that is no tax is paid in the fund. Furthermore, any payment out of a beneficiary fund, whether capital or income, is tax free. Beneficiary funds are designed to protect the assets of those who receive death benefit payouts. They play an important social role in Southern Africa, particularly for single-parent and child-led households, allowing minor children to stand a better chance of completing their education if their assets are managed in a beneficiary fund vehicle which is protected under the Pension Funds Act and overseen by a board of trustees. Any retirement fund member, regardless of their level of financial sophistication, can consider the use of a benefiiciary fund in estate planning as an alternative to a testamentary trust, by stipulating on their pension fund nomination form that the trustees consider the use of a beneficiary fund in the event of their death. Traditionally, beneficiary funds were regarded as a vehicle for children‚Äôs assets but the concept has evolved to become more relevant and attractive to a broader market from a tax savings point of view. The education aspect has remained a dominant benefit of beneficiary funds however, allowing the payment of a monthly income to finance a child‚Äôs entire education through to tertiary level and beyond. When the member turns 18, the beneficiary fund will engage with the member to determine the best use of his or her remaining funds into the future.  Governance  A beneficiary fund needs to comply with the same regulatory and governance standards as any other South African retirement fund in terms of the Pension Funds Act. The beneficiary fund has a board of trustees who need to register a set of rules with the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA), previously known as the Financial Services Board (South Africa).The board of trustees also need to draw up a number of policies in terms of Pension Funds Circular 130, for example a member communication policy, investment policy, code of conduct and a risk policy. Treating Customers Fairly (TCF) is becoming more central to the legislation governing retirement funds particularly as incorporated into the Conduct of Financial Institutions Bill (COFI).  Parties involved  Retirement funds select a preferred beneficiary fund whose administrator needs to have an administrator licence in terms of section 13B of the Pension Funds Act. Major service providers include institutions such Sanlam, Alexander Forbes Group Holdings and independent player Fairheads. Once the funds are in a beneficiary fund, the trustees of the beneficiary fund take over the fiduciary duty from the retirement fund trustees. Some criticisms of beneficiary funds have involved investment managers running beneficiary funds in order gather assets. Best practice is therefore to outsource this to independent asset managers. Investments need to be in line with Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act, which stipulates strict prudential guidelines. In the event of any maladministration or complaints the member has recourse to the Pension Funds Adjudicator.  Industry and legislative framework  Death benefits arising from retirement funds are distributed in accordance with S37c of the Pension Funds Act. This section allows trustees of retirement funds to make decisions regarding the allocation of the death benefits. S37C imposes significant discretionary duties upon trustees, leading to much confusion in the industry, as commented on by various experts. A 2014 amendment to the Pension Funds Act has broadened the allowable benefits that can go into a beneficiary fund to include all employment-related benefits of the member of the retirement fund.

History  Jadav Molai Payeng, the man who planted the Molai Forest Molai forest is named after Jadav Payeng, Indian environmental activist and forestry worker. After an initial 200 hectare planting by the social forestry division of Golaghat district was abandoned in 1983, the forest was single-handedly attended by Payeng for 30 years and now encompasses an area of about 1,360 acres / 550 hectares. Payeng planted and tended trees on a sandbar of Majuli island in the Brahmaputra River, eventually becoming a forest reserve. Molai forest now houses Bengal tigers, Indian rhinoceros, over 100 deer and rabbits besides monkeys and several varieties of birds, including a large number of vultures. There are several thousand trees, including valcol, arjun (Terminalia arjuna), Pride of India (Lagerstroemia speciosa), royal poinciana (Delonix regia), silk trees (Albizia procera), moj (Archidendron bigeminum) and cotton trees (Bombax ceiba). Bamboo covers an area of over 300 hectares. A herd of around 100 elephants regularly visits the forest every year and generally stays for around six months. They have given birth to 10 calves in the forest. Media Molai forest and Payeng have been the subject of a number of documentaries. A locally made film documentary, produced by Jitu Kalita in 2012 The Molai Forest, was screened at the Jawaharlal Nehru University.

He published 180 research publications in International journals spanning the fields of spectroscopy, semiconductor physics, magnetism. quantum electronics and microwave superconductivity. He established a large Microwave Research group at Delhi University (DU). He started teaching of Electronics as a discipline separate from Physics and played a key role in introducing electronics courses into regular science academic programmes all over the country. He was the first Head of the Department of Electronic Science at the South Campus of the Delhi University and the first Dean of the Faculty of Interdisciplinary and Applied Sciences in South Campus. In 1974 he became Professor of Physics and in 1980, the Head of the department and the Dean of the Faculty of Science, Delhi University. He also served as Pro-Vice Chancellor of Delhi University. He pursued further research with Nobel Laureate Professor Gerhard Herzberg at National Research Council of Canada during 1960 to 1962 in the field of microwave spectroscopy. He was the first to observe rotational transition in hydrogen bounded molecules. His other assignments included work at the University of Sheffield, U.K.; University of Queensland, Australia; Pierre and Marie Curie University, France; and Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan.

The house is unusual as an example of a saltbox, a dwelling type more commonly associated with Colonial-era New England. The timber-framed house has two stories on the eastern main facade, and one story in the rear. It is unusual for a Settlement Era house to have such large rooms, large windows, and two fireplaces. Dibble was born in Madison County, New York in 1815 to Thomas and Ruth Gates Dibble. He married his wife Julia Ann Sturges in Van Buren County, Iowa in July 1845. In 1852, Horace, Julia, their three children, along with members of the Sturges family, traveled overland to Oregon and settled in the Needy area of the Willamette Valley. While riding out looking for lost cattle, Horace came upon a knoll covered with apple trees not far from the four corners of what is now Molalla. He decided that this is where he wanted to live out his life, and arranged to purchase the land belonging to the widow Rachel Larkins. He hired a local builder who was a former seafarer, who took three years to build the house. The Dibbles and their then 6 children moved into their new home in 1859. Two more children were born to them in the house. The family lived in the home until 1909. Horace died in 1899, a man noted for his thrift. Julia died in 1904, and was a loving mother, a kind friend, and as long as she was physically able, was very ready to extend a helping hand to the sick and needy. In 1909 the house was rented and then sold to Dudley and Goldie Boyles. They lived in the house only until 1914, when Dudley was elected Clackamas County Recorder, and they moved to Oregon City. In 1930 Dudley lost his life in an automobile accident, leaving Goldie with two daughters to raise. She maintained ownership of the house, renting it out, until she was finally able to return to Molalla and live in the house until her death in 1968. Her heirs then sold the house to Ruth McBride (Mrs Albert) Powers, who did some immediate restoration work and arranged for the house to be purchased by the Molalla Area Historical Society. The historical society was incorporated in January 1970 for the purpose of restoring the Dibble house and using it as a museum. The Dibble House was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 19, 1974. The Dibble House is operated as a museum by the Molalla Area Historical Society, together with the Fred Vonder Ahe House and Ivor Davies Hall. The museum is open for tours on Fridays and Saturdays from 1-4 PM from May through October, and by appointment.

Biography Salmann was born in 1955 in Palestine and grew up in Wadi El Joz in east Jerusalem. His father was Salim (Saleem) Abu Khaled al Tamimi, a businessman and passionate activist, and his mother Salim's second wife Nazima abu Rajabb al Tamimi;Kristjana Gu√∞brandsd√≥ttir, Von: Saga Amal Tamimi ([Reykjav√≠k]: B√≥ka√∫tg√°fan H√≥lar, 2013), p. 9. his elder siblings are, in order of age, Younes, Rawda, Safah, Amneh, along with his younger sister Amal. Younes moved to Iceland in 1966, Amneh some years later, and Salmann in 1971, at the age of sixteen.Kristjana Gu√∞brandsd√≥ttir, Von: Saga Amal Tamimi ([Reykjav√≠k]: B√≥ka√∫tg√°fan H√≥lar, 2013), pp. 15, 17, 25. He had been travelling to the US, but stopped over in Iceland to see his brother Younes and decided to stay.Eygl√≥ Svala Arnarsd√≥ttir, 'To a Mosque on a Magic Carpet', Iceland Review, 52.1 (2014), 64‚Äì68 (p. 68). Salmann's first partner was √û√≥rst√≠na Bj√∂rg √ûorsteinsd√≥ttir, with whom he had Mar√≠a Bj√∂rg Tamimi and Nadia Tamimi.Valger√∞ur √û. J√≥nsd√≥ttir, Str√≠√∞ og fri√∞ur √≠ l√≠fi Mar√≠u, Morgunbla√∞i√∞, 14 December 2008, https://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/1260154/ . In the mid-1980s, he married Ingibj√∂rg Sigurj√≥nsd√≥ttir, with whom he had Yousef Ingi Tamimi and Nazima Krist√≠n Tamimi; the couple have five children together. Salmann worked as a sailor and in construction before completing his studies in computer science at the University of Iceland. He then worked for Iceland's national hospital, but was dismissed in 2006. In 2012, the Supreme Court of Iceland held that his dismissal was illegal. In the later 1970s and 1990s, Salmann lived in Sweden.Valger√∞ur √û.

Family conflict Salmann assisted his sister Amal and her children to move to Iceland in 1995, where Amal became the second foreign-born person (and the first foreign-born woman) to sit in the Icelandic parliament.Gu√∞ni Thorlaicus J√≥hannesson, The History of Iceland (Santa Barbara: Greenwood, 2013), https://books.google.com/books?id=Elh1oH6ESSIC& (p. 138); https://icelandreview.com/news/2011/11/04/first-foreign-born-woman-joins- icelands-parliament ; https://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2012/09/17/amal_tamimi_tekur_saeti_a_althingi/ . Later, Salmann disowned her over her partnership with an Icelandic man. According to Amal, Salmann tried to persuade Icelandic authorities to have her judged as an unfit mother. Amal claims that Salmann felt her daughters were not safe in her home because of her relationship with a Christian man.Kristjana Gu√∞brandsd√≥ttir, Von: Saga Amal Tamimi ([Reykjav√≠k]: B√≥ka√∫tg√°fan H√≥lar, 2013), pp. 70‚Äì76. In 2014, Amal said that she and Salmann are not on speaking terms. Political life In 1987, Salmann founded the Association Iceland-Palestine (F√©lagi√∞ √çsland-Palest√≠na). On 24 July 2014, Salmann made the headlines in Iceland for his comment at The Jerusalem Post news article on Israel about the funeral of Israeli soldiers: \\"To hell inshallah. Your friends will follow u. Victory to Hamas and Jihad Islami.\\" Many condemned his remarks. In the 2014 municipal elections, Salmann was a candidate for D√∂gun. Salmann, however, has close ties with Bj√∂rk Vilhelmsd√≥ttir, a prominent member of the Social Democratic Alliance. Bj√∂rk is married to Sveinn R√∫nar Hauksson, chairman of the Association Iceland-Palestine. Religious life In 1997, Salmann founded the Association of Muslims in Iceland (F√©lag m√∫slima √° √çslandi), being succeeded as its chair in 2010 by Ibrahim Sverrir Agnarsson.Eygl√≥ Svala Arnarsd√≥ttir, 'To a Mosque on a Magic Carpet', Iceland Review, 52.1 (2014), 64‚Äì68 (p. 65). The Association of Muslims in Iceland has a mosque in √Årm√∫li in Reykjav√≠k, where Salmann is one of two imams. Since founding the Association of Muslims in Iceland Salmann has become one of the foremost spokesmen for Muslims in Iceland, making numerous media appearances both in Iceland and abroad. One issue on which he has recently had a prominent role has been the building of a new mosque in Reykjavik.E.g. Eygl√≥ Svala Arnarsd√≥ttir, 'To a Mosque on a Magic Carpet', Iceland Review, 52.1 (2014), 64‚Äì68; https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-27813274 . In 2010, Salmann said that the Association of Muslims in Iceland would never raise funds abroad to build a mosque; by accepting funds abroad one jeopardised losing the reins of control. His successor, however, has said that funds for the mosque will be raised abroad, including Muslims in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. Controversies In 2014, Salmann made a series of controversial statements in relation to the Association of Muslims in Iceland's plan to build a new mosque in Reykjavik. =Position on Sharia law= In a radio programme on 28 May 2014, Salmann expressed the view that thieves should have their hands cut off. When his comments caused an outrage Salmann insisted that he had not meant what he said. Salmann made news when he proposed to bring charges for hate-speech against some of the people who had made personal comments about him in this connection.Zo√´ Robert, 'Founder of Muslim Association Sues for Hate Speech', Iceland Review, 4 June 2014, https://icelandreview.com/news/2014/06/04/founder-muslim-association-sues- hate-speech . However, in a television interview on 18 June 2014 Salmann reiterated that he supported amputation as a punishment for theft, just as murderers deserve the death penalty, unless \\"the family of the deceased does not forgive them\\". =Attitude towards women and homosexuality= In a television interview on 18 June 2014, Salmann discussed the role of men and women. The wife can be \\"the head of the family\\", because in most cases, she raises the children and controls their dietary habits, whilst it can be demanding for a man to be \\"the head of the family\\", especially when they would have to \\"take care of his wife from A‚ÄìZ\\". In the same interview, Salmann explained that a Muslim can't be homosexual, the religion does not allow that. He said he wouldn't deny a same-sex matrimony in his congregation, even though homosexuality is considered a sin in Islam, as it is in other religions. He also explained that, according to the Qur'an, homosexuality is not a deadly sin, as other people had stated before, that the Qur'an explains that homosexuals should be \\"reasoned with and directed to the right path\\". =Naming committee incident= The Tamimi's requested to have the spelling of their name changed from Tamimi to Tam√≠m√≠ since that corresponds more precisely with spelling in the language but the naming committee rejected the applications saying there was no permission in the naming laws to make any changes at all to surnames.Benn√Ω Sif √çsleifsd√≥ttir, '‚Äû√ûa√∞ er nefnilega f√≠nna a√∞ vera sen en d√≥ttir‚Äú: √Üttarn√∂fn √≠ √≠slensku samf√©lagi', unpublished BA thesis, University of Iceland, 2013, https://hdl.handle.net/1946/15301, pp. 43‚Äì44.

Unveiled in April 2014, it is the first product by OnePlus. The OnePlus One was designed to compare favorably ‚Äì in performance, quality, and price ‚Äì to flagship devices by leading smartphone manufacturers. It was also intended to be developer friendly, and has since received a wide variety of ROMs and custom kernels from the community. The OnePlus One shipped to most markets with the Cyanogen OS operating system pre-installed, a commercial variant of CyanogenMod. The phone was first made available for sale on 25 April 2014, exclusively from the OnePlus website, but initially required prospective customers to obtain an invitation before they could purchase it. These invitations were primarily distributed by the company through contests, some of which attracted attention for their unconventional or controversial nature. On 6 June 2014, the device was available for general sale. As of 20 April 2015, the device no longer required an invite to purchase.  Development  The OnePlus company was founded on 16 December 2013 by former Oppo vice-president Pete Lau. The company's main goal was to design his \\"dream\\" smartphone; one that would balance the quality of high-end devices from its major competitors with a lower price than other phones in its class. He argued that, despite their lower cost, users would \\"never settle\\" for the lower-quality devices produced by other Chinese companies, and similar startups such as Blu and Yota. Lau compared the ideals of OnePlus with those of the Japanese company Muji, with a focus on high quality products with simplistic designs. The company's primary cost-cutting measure was a decision to exclusively sell the device online, rather than at retail or through wireless carriers, citing the success of a similar online sales model for Nexus devices. Continuing Lau's association with the platform from the Oppo N1, OnePlus entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Cyanogen Inc. to base its product's Android software upon Cyanogen OS, a commercial variant of the popular custom ROM CyanogenMod, and use its trademarks outside China. The OnePlus One was officially unveiled on 23 April 2014 for a limited release on 25 April: described as a \\"flagship killer\\", its prices were set at US$299 and US$349 for the 16 GB and 64 GB models respectively‚Äîwhich one critic estimated was roughly half the price of the then recently unveiled Samsung Galaxy S5.  Release and distribution  The device was sold online exclusively through the OnePlus website. Stock of the device was previously limited through an invite system; the company had made the device available for purchase without an invitation during special promotions, however, such as on Black Friday, and in December 2014 for the holiday shopping season. On 9 February 2015, OnePlus announced that it would begin to hold such open sales every Tuesday. In an announcement on 20 April 2015 marking the one-year anniversary of its release, OnePlus announced that the One would be available without an invite \\"forever\\", but hinted that the requirement may return for its successor. Co-founder Carl Pei explained that \\"by rigorously testing and improving our logistical structure over the last one year, we are far more confident that our processes have matured enough for us to handle the increased production and after-sales support that comes along with opening up sales. It's what we've been working towards, and now we're ready.\\" Invites were first given out through a promotion known as \\"Smash the Past\\", in which 100 users would be selected to win an opportunity to purchase a 16 GB OnePlus One for only $1, along with three invites they can give to friends, if they record a video of themselves breaking their previous phone. Some users misinterpreted the promotion, however, and prematurely posted videos on YouTube of them breaking their phones. Users were later not required to destroy their phones, and could instead donate them to the charity Medic Mobile. OnePlus launched a second contest, \\"Ladies First\\", on 12 August 2014, inviting women to take photos of themselves holding the OnePlus logo or having drawn it on their bodies, with the winners decided by a vote receiving an invite to buy the One, and a OnePlus T-shirt. The promotion was met with controversy, as others felt that the contest promoted the objectification of women: some users posted entries that consisted of existing photos of women with OnePlus logos edited onto them, while another posted a picture of herself performing middle finger gestures, accompanied by a comment denouncing the contest as sexist. In response to the criticism, the contest was pulled only hours after it was announced: the company stated that \\"we want to encourage even more women to get involved with and excited about the amazing things happening in tech right now. The 'Ladies First' contest was a very misguided effort by a few isolated employees to do just that, however there is no question the post not only failed to better include our female community but actually perpetuated a stereotype that OnePlus in no way supports or condones.\\" On 25 August 2014, OnePlus began a summer-themed photography coverage as a replacement, giving away 10,000 invites. In December 2014, the One was released in India exclusively through Amazon; invites were still necessary to purchase the device outside special promotions, which have been held occasionally since its launch. OnePlus also announced plans to establish a presence in the country, with plans to open 25 official walk-in service centres across India. In August 2015, nearly 18 months after its release, the One was officially released in the United Arab Emirates exclusively through a local online retailer souq.com. Customers can purchase the phone without the need of an invite. = Micromax conflict = Sales of the OnePlus One in India were temporarily halted following a temporary injunction granted to Micromax Mobile, alleging that the sale of the device in India violated its exclusive rights to distribute Cyanogen-branded products in South Asia‚Äîan agreement announced in November 2014 as part of a new joint venture, YU, and that its agreement superseded the agreement Cyanogen Inc. had established with OnePlus. The company disputed the arguments, noting that its Cyanogen-based software was different than that of Micromax's, and argued that the exclusivity agreement only meant that Cyanogen could not partner with any other company based in India, and did not inhibit the ability for OnePlus to market its products in the country with its trademarks. In response to the partnership, OnePlus had already begun the development of a new, in-house Android distribution, known as \\"OxygenOS\\", which it planned to replace CyanogenMod with for the device that the company planned via software updates to models distributed in India, along with a version for Chinese models known as \\"H2OS\\". On 25 December 2014, the court reversed the sales ban, noting that YU and OnePlus were within different market segments‚Äîlow-end and high-end devices respectively.  Specifications  = Hardware = The device's internal hardware includes a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 system-on-chip clocked at 2.5 GHz, 3 GB of RAM, and a 5.5-inch, JDI 1080p IPS LCD display. It includes either 16 or 64 GB of non-expandable storage. Its rear-facing camera features a 13 megapixel, Sony-manufactured Exmor IMX214 sensor, alongside a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. The OnePlus One supports LTE networks using bands 1, 3, 4, 7, 17, 38, and 40. Due to the company's startup stature, only one model of the device was released worldwide, without any additional regional SKUs like other smartphones. = Exterior = The chassis of the OnePlus One is constructed from magnesium, and is accompanied by a curved, textured rear cover in either black or white. Special denim, Kevlar, and bamboo wood covers were also unveiled as accessories, but the bamboo covers were temporarily cancelled due to quality issues. The device features capacitive navigation keys, but they can be disabled in favor of customizable navigation keys rendered on-screen. Anandtech characterized its design as being a \\"close cousin\\" to the Oppo Find 7A , although with a non-user- replaceable battery. =Software= Outside China, the OnePlus One shipped with CyanogenMod 11S, based on Android 4.4.4 \\"KitKat\\". The latest version of CyanogenMod 11S is 11.0-XNPH05Q. In China, OnePlus One ships with Oppo's ColorOS distribution, based on Android 4.3 \\"Jelly Bean\\". Alongside additional features added to the Android platform through Cyanogen (including wider customization options, an audio equalizer, encrypted messaging, and application privacy controls), the 11S software adds persistent voice commands, and gestures that can be performed while the phone is in standby to perform various functions, such as double-tapping the screen to turn it on, drawing a circle to go to the camera, and drawing a \\"V\\" to activate flashlight mode. An upgrade to Cyanogen OS 12.0, based on Android 5.0.2 \\"Lollipop\\" was released for all OnePlus One devices outside China on 14 April 2015. The latest version of Cyanogen OS for this phone is 13.1.2-ZNH2KAS3P0-bacon based on Android Marshmallow 6.0.1(AOSP), released in August 2016. This brings latest September Security Patches for Android and improves the deep integration of \\"Cortana\\"-Microsoft's Digital Assistant into Cyanogen OS due to strategic partnership between Microsoft and Cyanogen; Microsoft also being an important investor in the company. Two in-house Lollipop-based distributions, OxygenOS and HydrogenOS, were released earlier, on 4 April 2015, outside and inside China respectively. On 9 April 2016, OnePlus One devices running Cyanogen OS started receiving Cyanogen OS 13.0.1 based on Android Marshmallow 6.0.1. Team Cyanogen started rolling out Cyanogen OS 13.1 on 10 June 2016. CyanogenOS 13.1 for OnePlus One includes mods for Skype, OneNote, Microsoft Hyperlapse and an updated Cortana mod. Android 9.0 \\"Pie\\" is available for the device through the successor of CyanogenMod, LineageOS. The same applied for Android 10.  Reception  The OnePlus One has received a positive reception, not withstanding occasional technical issues and lack of support. The design was unique compared to other smartphones, with the rear panel's \\"[white] crisp smooth plastic or the [black] sandpaper-like texture [that] feels good regardless of your preference\\", while \\"the front panel is also beautiful because of its minimalist style and lack of visible hardware buttons\\". There was much praise for the One's hardware, shared with contemporary devices that often cost up to twice as much. Tests found that the One usually performed as well as or even better despite being half the price of its rivals, not only due to its specs but also attributed to its largely bloatware-free CyanogenMod OS. In addition, its CyanogenMod operating system offers more customization options than stock Android albeit being less stable. The OnePlus One was one of the fastest phones upon its release and its specifications have aged well after a couple of years. The OnePlus One was generally considered superior to its closest competition. The similarly-priced Nexus 5 was more widely available and had more guaranteed updates from Google, however it suffered from some design compromises including mediocre battery life and camera quality to keep the price low, plus its internal hardware was aging. In terms of specifications and size, the OnePlus One could be compared to the much pricier 5.5-inch LG G3 whose screen was higher resolution but inferior quality. Similar to the Google Nexus line of devices, the One has expanded the trend of high spec but mid-priced Android devices; by 2015 when the succeeding OnePlus 2 was released there was competition from numerous affordable flagships including the Moto X Pure and Asus ZenFone 2. The OnePlus One's original distribution via an invite-only order system made the device difficult to acquire, so some reviewers decided against recommending it. The OnePlus One, in retrospect, has been considered one of the best-supported community developer phones, with a wide variety of ROMs and custom kernels. The succeeding OnePlus 2 and subsequent OnePlus phones have not amassed such third-party support, furthermore their pricing has risen to mainstream. =Sales= As of the end of 2014, the OnePlus One has sold over one million units, despite only planning to sell up to 50,000 units. The East Asian market accounted for 39% of the company's shipments in 2014, followed by Europe with 33%, 22% in North America, and 7% in India. In total, the device generated a total revenue of $300 million through December 2014.

The current line-up of the band includes Gary Mundy, Anthony di Franco and Stuart Dennison. Originally a part of the English power electronics and industrial music scene in early 1980s, Ramleh experimented with a more traditional rock format in their later releases. History The group was formed by Mundy in 1982 as a part of the power electronics scene in early 1980s, which included artists such as Whitehouse and Sutcliffe J√ºgend. After releasing Onslaught cassette, he was joined by Philip Best, a 14-year-old musician who was known for his involvement in Iphar and Whitehouse. The band's 21/5/62/82 cassette was released in 1982 and was titled as a reference to the execution of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann. Ramleh recorded four more cassette releases in 1982: Onslaught, Live to Theresienstadt, Live New Force, and Live Phenol. Live McCarthy, Live at Moden Tower 12/10/1983, and Live at Prossneck 1/10/83, A Return to Slavery and The Hand of Glory EPs were added to the band's catalogue in 1983. This was followed by a string of cassette releases in 1983. Although Ramleh disbanded in 1984, Mundy's own record label Broken Flag continued releasing Ramleh material. After releasing Hole in the Heart cassette and a few records under the Ramleh alias in 1987, Mundy reformed the band in 1989 with Best. The reunion was followed by Grudge for Life LP in 1989. Inspired by Mundy's experimental rock band Skullflower, the band began to incorporate rock influences in their records, starting with Blowhole in 1991. After releasing Caught From Behind, a split with Italian artist M.T.T, and Crystal Revenge, the band added Skullflower members Anthony di Franco on bass and Stuart Dennison on drums to its line-up. The new line-up released Homeless in 1994. The band continued releasing rock records in late 1990s, which included Adieu, All You Judges and Be Careful What You Wish For in 1995, and Works III in 1996. After releasing Boeing, Mundy disbanded Ramleh for the second time. In 2009, Mundy and di Franco reformed Ramleh with drummer Martyn Watts. In that year, the band also returned to its original power electronics aesthetics with Valediction LP, although Mundy states that the band will be performing in both rock and electronic genres. In 2015, Stuart Dennison returned to drum with Ramleh and played on the US west coast tour in January 2016. Musical style and imagery Early recordings of Ramleh were labeled as power electronics and noise music. Nevertheless, in 1990s the band started experiment with more traditional rock music structures. The band's more traditional works were commonly labeled as \\"noise rock.\\" Frances Morgan of The Quietus described the band music during this era as \\"a brutal, abject strand of dark psychedelic rock,\\" while albums such as Works III and Boeing were labeled as \\"heavy psych-noise rock.\\" Skullflower and Butthole Surfers were influences on these works. Ramleh's first album after 2009 reunion expressed a revival of the band's original power electronics genre and was compared to the works of Japanese noise musician Merzbow, while the band retained its rock music instrumentation during this era, performing on both genres. In its early days, Ramleh flirted with Nazi and fascist imagery for its shock value, like other bands in the industrial music scene. Nevertheless, Mundy and Best since discontinued this practice and disavowed it, denying any affiliations with hate groups, although there is no direct quote relating to this.

Two kinds of disciplines in this world were set forth by Me in times of yore ‚Äì for the Samkhyas the discipline of knowledge (Jnana-nishtha), and for the yogins, that of works (Karma-nishtha). \\" ‚Äì (Bhagavad Gita III.3) In his commentary on this sloka, Sankara states ‚Äì \\"‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§∏‡§æ ‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§µ‡§ø‡§ß‡§æ ‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§†‡§æ ‡§á‡§§‡§ø? ‡§Ü‡§π - What is this two-fold discipline?

Faith with trust and dedication is called shraddha; faith with trust and confidence is nishtha, in this sloka, Krishna speaks about the twofold path of faith and confidence. Self-knowledge (atma jnana) can exist when self- knowledge is not fully established; Jnana-nishtha refers to self-knowledge that is fully assimilated and established. Sanatkumara tells Narada (Chandogya Upanishad VII.xx.1 and VII.xxi.1) that when one serves devotedly, then one becomes endowed with faith; without serving devotedly one does not acquire faith, and that when one acts, then one serves devotedly. The word Nishtha or 'devotion', appearing in the former passage, is used to mean - 'steadiness'. Even though the text says nothing about a teacher, to Sankara it indicates the steadfast seeking of a teacher‚Äôs wisdom for acquiring knowledge of Brahman; and to Prabhavananda it indicates gain of faith by attending on a teacher. Sankara states ‚Äì A distinction has been made between Jnana-nishtha (‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®-‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§†‡§æ) and Karma-nishtha (‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ-‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§†‡§æ).Vedic works are intended for him only who has desires; the renunciation of these works is enjoined on him who seeks only the Self. To Vivekananda the word Nishtha meant ‚Äì'singleness of attachment'; he states ‚Äì\\" That singleness of attachment (Nishtha) to a loved object, without which no genuine love can grow, is very often also the cause of the denunciation of everything else. \\" Grammatical significance Sutra I.i.26 of PƒÅ·πáini in his Ashtadhyayi defines Nishta in Sukta I.i.26 which reads - ‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§µ‡§§‡•Ç ‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§†‡§æ ‚Äì that the affixes of the Past Participles - kta and katavatu, are called Nishtha. In this text, Panini in accordance with the context of their use and application expounds and explains many rules relating to the duplication and reduplication of many words.

It serves the Etna section of the town; the Classical Revival building it occupies was the first purpose-built library building in the town, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is a modest brick building, designed by Dartmouth College professor Robert E. Fletcher and built in 1905. Description and history The Etna Library is located in the village of Etna in eastern Hanover, on the north side of Etna Road near King Road. It is a modest single-story masonry structure, built of red brick with granite trim and covered by a hip roof. Its main facade is three bays wide, with paired narrow sash windows on either side of the center entrance. Each sash window is topped by a transom window, and the paired windows have rough- cut stone lintels and sills. The entrance is sheltered by a projecting portico, which has round Tuscan columns supporting a corniced entablature. The entrance is a single door, set in a large segmented-arch opening with flanking double-width sidelight windows. The building has a rear projection that was designed to house a vault for the town documents. Hanover's first lending library, a private endeavour, was established in 1801, and it and later similar organizations were based in the centrally located Etna village through the 19th century. In 1898, the town voted to establish a public library, which was seeded with these earlier collections. In March 1905, the town appropriated funds for the construction of a building, and this one was completed later that year. It was designed by Robert E. Fletcher, a Dartmouth College professor of engineering. The building has been little altered since its construction, principally to add a lavatory in the former vault space.

It was initially an open Hall house but was extensively re-built during the 16th century to add a first floor and chimney. In the late 18th and early 19th century the front of the building was clad in brick. Today the timber framed bones of the building are invisible from the outside. Known today as Church House, the house was originally known as Doggetts Farm until 1913 when Miss Geraldine Rickards converted it and added Rickards Hall adjoining to the west. In 1921 Miss Rickards gave the house to the Parish Church for community use. The Museum was established following an exhibition in 1995 marking the centenary of the Edenbridge Town Council, organised by the Edenbridge and District Historical Society. In 1997 the Eden Valley Museum Trust was formed to develop and run a museum for the Edenbridge area. The Trust was granted charitable status in November 1997, and with the aid of a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund the Museum opened in 2000. The Museum is a registered charity. Church House is held on lease from Edenbridge Town Council. Admission to the Museum has been free since 2004.  Collections  Run mainly by local volunteers, the museum is home to collections that cover a range of topics on the Eden Valley from its early origins to recent times. These permanent displays, describing the topography, people, communities and trades are spread over several rooms and are updated regularly. In addition one or two temporary exhibitions are mounted each year lasting from 12 to 18 months.

He held a leading role in the Mining Institute from its inauguration in 1852 as Treasurer and a member of the council before becoming the fourth president in 1869. As president, Boyd oversaw the installation of the Nicholas Wood Memorial Hall (the Mining Institute's headquarters in Newcastle upon Tyne) and the Newcastle College of Physical Science.Boyd, H.F.

Family Search Community Trees, Edward Fenwick Boyd, retrieved 8 April 2014 He was the third son of William, a banker and partner in the Newcastle Old Bank,http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/30th-march-1839/7/intelligence-of- the-old-bank-of-newcastle-or-tbe-f, The Spectator, 30 March 1839, pg. 7, Evidences this Bank, Accessed 8 April 2014 and Esther (n√©e Locke) Boyd. His earliest experience of education was with Henry Atkinson at the High Bridge, before attending Witton-le- Wear Grammar School in 1821 for the subsequent five years. It was here he found a passion and talent for art. Upon leaving school he ‚Äòserved his time‚Äô, firstly, at Cocken White House Pit before moving to Bowes‚Äô House Pit where he met Thomas Crawford, manager of Lord Durham‚Äôs extensive collieries. It was believed that Boyd‚Äôs connection with Crawford provided him with his initial understanding of the business. Between October 1830 and May 1831, Boyd attended Edinburgh University however he maintained a connection with the mining industry at Towneley Main Colliery. Upon his return from University, he accompanied Mr Matthias Dunn, a mine Inspector, on visitations to various collieries in Scotland including Prestongrange, Kilmarnock, Middleton and Dalmellington in Ayrshire. Through this connection and work with Mr Dunn, Boyd obtained his first appointment as under viewer and surveyor at Hetton-le-Hole Colliery in 1832. Five years later, Boyd moved to Urpeth and became resident viewer of Urpeth Colliery. In addition to this, 1837 also saw Boyd‚Äôs appointment as mineral agent to the Dean and Chapter of Durham, after the retirement of Mr T. Fenwick, as well as the opportunity of becoming manager of Wylam Colliery on behalf of the Blackett family. Personal life As his professional life was beginning to kick start, also was his personal life. In 1841 he married Ann, daughter of George Anderson, and soon began a family. Between 1846 and 1852 the couple went on to have four children; Juliana, George, Robert and Hugh and in 1856 Boyd bought the property at Moor House and built himself and his family a house. He resigned his position as manager of the Urpeth Colliery and was 'proposing to take life somewhat more easily'. However the fall of the Northumberland and Durham District Bank during the financial crisis of 1857 meant this was no longer possible. The bank engulfed his inheritance from his father as well as his private savings leaving him with a young family in need of education with very minimal funds to do so hence he was forced to begin rebuilding his fortunes a fresh. He continued with his previous ventures and took on many new agencies making this time of his life the busiest to date. In 1858 he became Chief Mining Engineer of the Consett Iron Company and until 1872 he directly superintended the working of their various collieries. Formation of the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers Disasters such as the explosion at St Hilda‚Äôs Colliery in 1839http://www.dmm.org.uk/names/n1839-01.htm, Durham Mining Museum, St Hilda colliery Disaster, Accessed 8 April 2014 brought about an awareness amongst miners and men working within this community of the need for a society with fixed rules and aims within the mining community in the hope of preventing such disasters. As a result, the South Shields Committee recommended the introduction of the compulsory registration of mine plans, a system of government inspections, the prohibiting of the employment of women and children below ground and the need for a better scientific education of the Mining Engineers.Hinsley, F.B.: The North of England Institute of Mining Engineers and the Establishment of the College of Physical Science at Newcastle Upon Tyne, public lecture delivered 9 July 1971 accessible at https://mininginstitute.org.uk/about-us/history-of-the-institute/, retrieved 11 May 2017 However, it was not until 1850 that legislation was passed requiring collieries to appoint inspectors. Mine plans were expected to be kept and produced and all fatal accidents were to now be reported to the Home Office. Similar to the disaster at St Hilda‚Äôs, an explosion at Seaton Colliery on 9 June 1852 acted as a catalyst for the founding of the NEIMME. Leading figures such as Nicholas Wood, T.E. Forster, Sir George Elliot, 1st Baronet and Edward Sinclair (all of which were present at the inquest of the Seaton explosion) joined forty four coal owners and subsequently founded ‚ÄòThe North of England Society for the Prevention of Accidents and for other Purposes Connected with Mining‚Äô. At a second meeting the society changed its name to the more pointed ‚ÄòThe North of England Institute of Mining Engineers‚Äô and it was not until 1870 when it opened its doors to Engineers that its title was adapted again to ‚ÄòThe North of England Institute of Mining & Mechanical Engineers‚Äô. The aims of the society ultimately were to search for the causes of mining accidents exemplified at Seaton and St. Hilda‚Äôs, improve the ventilation of mines and to generally improve the safety and conditions of mines. Boyd played a significant role in the foundation of the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers and his reliability led to his appointment as Treasurer from the inauguration of the NEIMME until 1869. In addition to this role, Boyd worked closely alongside the first President, Nicholas Wood, in his efforts towards creating a schooling system for Mining Engineers as well as projects such as ‚ÄòOn a \\"wash\\" or \\"drift\\" through a portion of the coal- field of Durham‚Äô which they presented to the members of the Mining Institute in December 1863.Wood, N. & Boyd, E.F., On a \\"Wash\\" or \\"Drift\\" Throughout a Portion of the Coal-Field of Durham Transactions - North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers 13, 1863-1864, 69-85. His dedication and hard working ethic resulted in his election as the fourth President of the NEIMME in 1869 following that of George Elliot. During his time in office he worked excessively on the opening of the Nicholas Wood Memorial Hall, which was to become the home of the Mining Institute, and pursued the work of Nicholas Wood in the foundation of the College of Physical College. College of Physical Science The foundation of the College of Physical Science in 1871, the fore-runner of Newcastle University, is considered to be one of Boyd‚Äôs most significant achievements during his presidency. Schooling was a hot topic amongst the leading members since the founding of the NEIMME and the formation of a college was desired by Nicholas Wood himself.Boyd, E.F Inaugural Address Transactions - North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers 21 1871-72, 223-238 It was believed by many that schooling was essential for men in this field as no other branch of engineering required such diversified training and practise as that of a Mining Engineer. With mines being sunk deeper, mining was growing increasingly more difficult and dangerous therefore the education and professionalization of this role was deemed to be more essential. Nicholas Wood drew up an outline for a possible course lasting three years, intending for it to be purely practical and industrial in character. It was hoped that the college would be independent, however due to costs this was not feasible, hence it was decided that the College of Mining and Engineering was to be located at Durham in connection with Durham University.University of Durham King's College Mining Bulletin The University would provide and pay two professors; one of mathematics and natural philosophy and the other of applied mechanics, on the grounds that their service would be useful to both institutions. The College itself was required to provide three more; professors of Chemistry, Geology and Mine Working and Surveying and plan- drawing and Practical Engineering. With such constraints, the Miners were required to raise money for both the building and the salaries of the remaining professors. This attempt was disappointing and ultimately led to the temporary abandonment of the project. After the death of Nicholas Wood, the subsequent two presidents, T.E. Forster and George Elliot, made little effort to revive the project and it was not until the appointment of Edward Fenwick Boyd that the project was resurrected. He championed the importance of education and argued that workmen needed to be well directed. It was believed that managers would provide encouragement and direction, bring about punctuality, self-reliance, obedience and education,. He brought in a new initiative and successfully developed a connection with the Dean of Durham University. Boyd had been involved in the early talks regarding the formation of a College but he believed these were unsuccessful and unproductive due to a number of reasons, the most significant being the disagreements regarding the location of the College and the problems surrounding funding. Fortunately, Boyd‚Äôs presidency fell during a period of flourishing trade in the district in which there was a strong demand for young men of ability and energy to manage the industries of the area. With a growth in prosperity and a demand for training in such industries, Boyd was led to believe that the community would be more forthcoming, economically and socially, with supporting the foundation of the college. Boyd believed education would ‚Äòelevate the general tone of the community, and conduce to the honour and prosperity of the nation, and enable it to develop the vast industrial advantages which it possesses‚Äô. With the appointment of the new Dean at Durham University, William Lake (Dean of Durham), Boyd, with help from Lowthian Bell, again attempted to lay a case for the College to be based in Newcastle upon Tyne. A committee was finally appointed on 9 November 1869 by the Mining Institute to confer with the Principals of Durham University. Many private discussions took place between Lake, Boyd and Lowthian Bell and a basic agreement was reached. A public meeting held in Newcastle on 25 March 1871 acted as the backdrop for the proposals from the Committee. Lake proposed that the University of Durham were to give ¬£1000 per annum for six years towards the expenses of establishing a College at Newcastle, provided that a similar sum for the like term could be guaranteed from other sources.The Executive Committee to The General Body of the Subscribers to The College of Physical Science, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Report of The Executive Committee to The General Body of the Subscribers to The College of Physical Science, Newcastle Upon Tyne,North of England Institute of Mining Engineers, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Transactions, Vol. XX,1870-1871, pp. ix-xiii The offer was accepted and advanced by the promise that aid would be made permanent if a sum to ensure the continuance of the support could be obtained. As previously stated, with the more prosperous nature of society, it was decided by the committee to appeal to the public for ¬£30,000 with the desire that the College should be opened at its earliest opportunity, October 1871. In its first year of teaching the College had eight teaching staff, one hundred and seventy three students and offered instruction in four subjects; Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Geology, all of which expanded in the subsequent years. Although it offered a wide variety of subjects, the College upon its opening did not offer Mining Engineering as an individual subject as it believed it could not be taught in the classroom but that practical experience was as vital as a good general and scientific education. Numerous influential figures commented on the importance of the education of a Mining Engineer and the advantages of Physical Science upon the opening of the College. The Dean of Durham commented on these advantages in a speech to the Institute regarding the inauguration of the Newcastle College of Physical Science expressing that the teaching of Physical Science trains to observe and inquire, shorten the gap between ideas and actual facts about nature and it also has a direct bearing on the business life. A student of such a discipline is trained to those rules of induction, of experiment and of verification and it gives a large knowledge of the immense world of material truth which nature can reveal.The Very Rev. The Dean of Durham, Inauguration of the Newcastle College of Physical Science in the North of England Institute of Mining Engineers, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Transactions: Vol. XXI, 1871-1872, pp. xv-xix Likewise, Professor John Young of the University of Glasgow commented on the education of a Mining Engineer as ‚Äòone whom is credited sufficient knowledge of the conditions under which minerals occur in the earth and render him a reliable advisor, know the qualities of mineral so as to decide on the worth of any that maybe found, sufficient mechanical skills to conduct all the operations connected with the extraction of the mineral from the earth. They should be a Geologist and a Mineralogist as well as a Civil Engineer‚Äô hence, the addition of Mining Engineering to the syllabus.Young, J.

The hall was erected in 1870, by public subscription, as a memorial to Nicholas Wood, the first President of the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers, after his death in December 1865. It was opened in July 1872 by the then President of the Mining Institute, Edward Fenwick Boyd, The Very Rev. the Dean of the Durham, the Mayor of Newcastle and numerous members of the town council.Newcastle Weekly Chronicle, 6 July 1872 It was erected primarily for the accommodation of the members of the coal trade as well as mining and Mechanical Engineers of the North of England and it has been the home of the Mining Institute ever since.The Building News, 15 November 1872 It was designed and built in the height of the Gothic revival by architect A.M. Dunn and it contains a large marble statue of a seated Nicholas Wood, created by Mr Wyon, overlooking the library. Today it continues to be of educational importance. It houses numerous documents, transactions, maps and books stemming from its origins in 1852. The addition of the lecture theatre in 1902 expanded this educational element and is used to host speakers and lectures based on numerous elements related to the mining industry ranging from ‚ÄòMigrant Miners‚Äô to ‚ÄòColliers Viewers, Engineers and the Making of the Modern World‚Äô.North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers, Mining the Institute: Lecture, Exhibitions and Events Programme, 2013-2014, North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers, 2013 Later life The ending of Boyd‚Äôs presidency in 1872 did not see the end of him as a member of the Institution; he continued as a member of the council until 1882.http://www.dmm.org.uk/whoswho/b601.htm .Durham Mining Museum, Biography of Edward Fenwick Boyd, Accessed 25 March 2014, 11:18 In 1875, he joined forces with his son Robert Fenwick Boyd to produce a paper on \\"The Coal- Measures and Oil Produce of the United States of America\\".Boyd, E.F.

This paper was the last of Edward Fenwick Boyd‚Äôs work to be read and disputed before the members of the Mining Institute before turning his focus and the remainder of his life to serving as a magistrate for the county. He devoted the rest of his time and health to the law and to county business. However, as his physical health began to deteriorate in 1883 he was forced to retire back to Moor House ending all activity in both the court room and the Institute and he was put under the care of his daughter until his death on 31 August 1889. In addition to the published work of Edward Fenwick Boyd, his time as President of the Institute saw the opening of the College of Physical Science and the Nicholas Wood Memorial Hall; both of which were highly influential and significant projects. His involvement in projects such as these demonstrates his dedication and passion for the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers.

In this way, this scheme removes the requirement for users to share public certificates for the purpose of encryption. Description of scheme The Sakai‚ÄìKasahara scheme allows the encryption of a message \\\\mathbb{M} to an receiver with a specific identity, \\\\textstyle I_U. Only the entity with the private key, \\\\textstyle K_U, associated to the identity, \\\\textstyle I_U, will be capable of decrypting the message. As part of the scheme, both the sender and receiver must trust a Private Key Generator (PKG), also known as a Key Management Server (KMS). The purpose of the PKG is to create the receiver's private key, \\\\textstyle K_U, associated to the receiver's identity, \\\\textstyle I_U. The PKG must securely deliver the identity-specific private key to the receiver, and PKG-specific public parameter, \\\\textstyle Z, to all parties. These distribution processes are not considered as part of the definition of this cryptographic scheme. =Preliminaries= The scheme uses two multiplicative groups \\\\textstyle E and \\\\textstyle G. It is assumed: * The Diffie-Hellman problem is hard in \\\\textstyle E. Meaning that given two members of the group \\\\textstyle P and \\\\textstyle Q, it is hard to find \\\\textstyle x such that \\\\textstyle [x].P = Q. * The Diffie-Hellman problem is hard in \\\\textstyle G. Meaning that given two members of the group g and t, it is hard to find \\\\textstyle x such that \\\\textstyle g^x = t. * There is a bilinear map, a Tate-Lichtenbaum pairing, \\\\textstyle e(,) from E to G. This means that for \\\\textstyle P a member of \\\\textstyle E and for \\\\textstyle g = e(P,P) a member of \\\\textstyle G: ::::\\\\textstyle e(P,[x].P) = e([x].P,P) = e(P,P)^x = g^x Frequently, \\\\textstyle E is a supersingular elliptic curve, such as \\\\textstyle E: y^2 = x^3 - 3x (over a finite field of prime order \\\\textstyle p). A generator \\\\textstyle P of prime order \\\\textstyle q is chosen in \\\\textstyle E. The group \\\\textstyle G is the image due to the pairing of the group generated by \\\\textstyle P (in the extension field of degree 2 of the finite field of order p). Two hash functions are also required, \\\\textstyle H_1 and \\\\textstyle H_2. \\\\textstyle H_1 outputs a positive integer, \\\\textstyle x, such that \\\\textstyle 1. \\\\textstyle H_2 outputs \\\\textstyle n bits, where \\\\textstyle n is the length of the message \\\\mathbb{M}. =Key generation= The PKG has a master secret \\\\textstyle z where 1, and a public key \\\\textstyle Z=[z].P which is a point on \\\\textstyle E. The PKG generates the private key, \\\\textstyle K_U, for the user with identity \\\\textstyle ID_U as follows: ::::\\\\textstyle K_U = [\\\\frac{1}{z + H_1(ID_U)}].P =Encryption= To encrypt a non-repeating message \\\\mathbb{M}, the sender requires receiver's identity, \\\\textstyle ID_U and the public PGK value \\\\textstyle Z. The sender performs the following operation. # Create: \\\\textstyle id = H_1(ID_U) # The sender generates \\\\textstyle r using \\\\textstyle r = H_1(\\\\mathbb{M}  id) # Generate the point \\\\textstyle R in \\\\textstyle E: #::::\\\\textstyle R = [r].([id].P + Z) # Create the masked message: #::::\\\\textstyle S = \\\\mathbb{M} \\\\oplus H_2(g^r) # The encrypted output is: \\\\textstyle (R,S) Note that messages may not repeat, as a repeated message to the same identity results in a repeated ciphertext. There is an extension to the protocol should messages potentially repeat. =Decryption= To decrypt a message encrypted to \\\\textstyle ID_U, the receiver requires the private key, \\\\textstyle K_U from the PKG and the public value \\\\textstyle Z. The decryption procedure is as follows: # Compute \\\\textstyle id = H_1(ID_U) # Receive the encrypted message: \\\\textstyle (R,S). # Compute: #::::\\\\textstyle w = e(R,K_U) # Extract the message: #::::\\\\textstyle \\\\mathbb{M} = S \\\\oplus H_2(w) # To verify the message, compute \\\\textstyle r = H_1(\\\\mathbb{M}id), and only accept the message if: #::::\\\\textstyle [r].([id].P + Z) \\\\equiv R =Demonstration of algorithmic correctness= The following equations demonstrate the correctness of the algorithm: :\\\\textstyle w = e(R,K_U) = e([r].([id].P + Z),K_U) = e([r].([id].P + [z].P),K_U) = e([r(id+z)].P,K_U) By the bilinear property of the map: :\\\\textstyle w = e([r(id+z)].P,K_U)= e([r(id+z)].P,[\\\\frac{1}{(id+z)}].P) = e(P,P)^{\\\\frac{r(id+z)}{(id+z)}} = g^r As a result: :\\\\textstyle S \\\\oplus H_2(w) = (\\\\mathbb{M} \\\\oplus H_2(g^r)) \\\\oplus H_2(w) = \\\\mathbb{M} Standardisation There are four standards relating to this protocol: * Initial standardisation of scheme was begun by IEEE in 2006. * The scheme was standardised by the IETF in 2012 within RFC 6508. * A key- exchange algorithm based on the scheme is the MIKEY-SAKKE protocol developed by the UK's national intelligence and security agency, GCHQ, and defined in RFC 6509. * Sakai-Kasahara, as specified in MIKEY-SAKKE, is the core key- exchange algorithm of the Secure Chorus encrypted Voice over IP standard. Security In common with other identity-based encryption schemes, Sakai- Kasahara requires that the Key Management Server (KMS) stores a master secret from which all users' private keys can be generated. Steven Murdoch has criticised MIKEY-SAKKE for creating a security vulnerability through allowing the KMS to decrypt every users' communication. Murdoch also noted that the lack of forward secrecy in MIKEY-SAKKE increases the harm that could result from the master secret being compromised. GCHQ, the creator of MIKEY-SAKKE, disputed this analysis, pointing out that the some organisations may consider such monitoring capabilities to be desirable for investigative or regulatory reasons, and that the KMS should be protected by an air-gap. Cryptographic libraries and implementations The scheme is part of the MIRACL cryptographic library.

Previously, he served as the vice-chancellor and president of the University of Hong Kong (HKU). He was the dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry of the University of Bristol before he assumed office at the HKU in April 2014, and was previously director of studies at Christ's College, Cambridge. Biography Peter Mathieson went to school in Penzance, Cornwall, then qualified in medicine with first-class honours from London Hospital Medical College in 1983. After junior posts in and around the West End of London, he went to Christ's College, Cambridge as a Medical Research Council (MRC) training fellow, studying for a PhD which was awarded in 1992. His thesis was titled \\"Role of T lymphocytes in autoimmune responses\\". While studying for his PhD, Mathieson also taught at Cambridge and was named ‚ÄòTeacher of the Year‚Äô in 1992 by the university's medical students. Mathieson was awarded a second MRC fellowship during which he worked on complement/immunology with Doug Fearon and Peter Lachmann. He was also Director of Studies for Clinical Medicine at Christ's College, Cambridge. Career =University of Bristol= Mathieson joined the University of Bristol in 1995 as the foundation professor of renal medicine. He was also honorary consultant nephrologist with the North Bristol NHS Trust. In 1999 he was elected as a fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences, United Kingdom. While at the University of Bristol, Mathieson ran ‚ÄòThe cellular basis of albuminuria‚Äô research project, with ¬£585,000 funding from the MRC from 2005 to 2008. The project aimed to ‚Äòdevelop ways of detecting and treating early kidney and heart disease‚Äô. In 2007 he was elected as the youngest ever president of the Renal Association and also became head of the University Department of Clinical Science at North Bristol. He was also appointed as director of research & development for the North Bristol NHS Trust. Between 2003 and 2007 he chaired the Research Grants Committee of Kidney Research UK [formerly National Kidney Research Fund]. He was a member of the Renal Association Clinical Trials committee from 1996 to 2007 and its chairman between 2000 and 2003. In 2008 he was appointed dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry at the University of Bristol. He was appointed Dean of the university's Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry in 2008. Foundation doctors at University Hospitals Bristol voted Mathieson as ‚ÄòTop Teacher‚Äô for 2011-12. A further MRC-funded research project on treatment of patients with membranous nephropathy (a type of kidney disease) found a treatment which mitigated against deterioration; the results were published in The Lancet. =University of Hong Kong= In October 2013, Mathieson was appointed vice chancellor of the University of Hong Kong, replacing Lap-Chee Tsui. His appointment was controversial as some staff felt that Mathieson lacked management experience and familiarity with Chinese society. Leong Che-hung, who headed the committee that appointed Mathieson noted that he had experience running a faculty at the University of Bristol, while Mathieson himself suggested his unfamiliarity with China gave the opportunity for a fresh start. refusal to appoint of Johannes Chan as pro-vice-chancellor. Mathieson supported the appointment. His tenure at HKU was described to be full of \\"tension and clashes between the university‚Äôs governing body and students\\". Five months into his vice-chancellorship, a students-led class boycott, protesting against Beijing authorities' decision of Hong Kong's suffrage, evolved into a 79-day occupy protest. During the crisis, he stated that independence was not a realistic political option for Hong Kong, but defended the rights of students to protest in favour of Hong Kong's democratic values. In 2015, Mathieson was elected as an honorary fellow of Hughes Hall, University of Cambridge. That year, a University of Hong Kong panel led by Mathieson selected Johannes Chan as pro-vice-chancellor, however the appointment was blocked by the university's governing council. Chan is pro- democracy, supports human rights, and had supported the student occupy protest in 2014, and was unpopular with the government. The episode was viewed as an incident in which the university's academic freedom was under threat, and Mathieson's authority suffered as a result; in a staff survey, 78% of people did not feel Mathieson had ‚Äúeffectively protected academic freedom‚Äù. Addressing the results of the survey, Mathieson acknowledged the unpopularity of some of his actions and questioned the survey's methodology. On 2 February 2017, 2 years before the original expiry of his contract, Mathieson resigned from the post of HKU. Mathieson claimed that he was squeezed out of the position by HKU's Chairman of the Governing Council, Arthur Li. The Chairman of the Staff Association, William Cheung, stated \\"you may now appreciate why we thank you [University of Edinburgh] so many times for taking Professor Mathieson on board\\" after claims that Mathieson failed to uphold academic freedom, discouraged debate on campus, and did not understand the needs of students emerged from a staff survey. Addressing the results of the survey, Mathieson described the survey as flawed in its methodology. Contrary to the views above, many in Hong Kong felt that he showed leadership and steered a very diplomatic course between the Hong Kong government, China, students, the university and the citizenry at a complex and difficult time in Hong Kong's history, when the 2014 student 'umbrella movement' emerged and brought the city centre to a standstill. His over-riding care and concern was for the safety of his students at a time when the movement became violent. He recognised independence was not a realistic political option for Hong Kong, but defended the rights of students to protest in favour of Hong Kong‚Äôs democratic values. =University of Edinburgh= Mathieson became Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh in February 2018. He will be the highest paid figure in Scottish Higher Education with a benefits package exceeding ¬£400,000. While the university said the salary was set in relation to vice chancellor pay at similar sized universities, it was criticised by the University and College Union during the UK-wide dispute between university staff and management over pensions. The ¬£342,000 salary is less than Mathieson was paid at HKU. He has lectured to undergraduate medical students on his specialism in kidney disease at Edinburgh.

The desired species in the feed, selectively crosses the membrane into the extracting solution. Perstraction was originally developed to overcome the downsides of liquid-liquid extraction, for example extractant toxicity and emulsion formation. Perstraction, or membrane extraction, has been applied to many fields including fermentation, waste water treatment and alcohol-free beverage production.  Introduction  Perstraction is the separation technique developed from liquid-liquid extraction. Due to the presence of the membrane a wider selection of extractants can be used, this can include the use of miscible solutions, for example the recovery of ammonia from waste water using sulphuric acid. This process is analogous to pervaporation in some ways. But the permeate is in liquid phase. Perstraction technique eliminates the problem of phase dispersion and separation altogether. A basic perstraction is called the single perstraction or membrane perstraction. An advantage is minimizing toxic damage to microorganisms or enzymes. Nevertheless, perstraction includes problems like expensive membranes, clogging and fouling of membranes.LUQUE, R., CAMPELO, J. and CLARK, J., eds, 2011. Handbook of Biofuels Production ‚Äì Processes and Technologies. Woodhead Publishing.  Applications  = Perstraction in butanol fermentation = Perstraction has been combined with the ABE (acetone butanol ethanol) fermentation for butanol production. Butanol is toxic to the fermentation, therefore perstraction can be applied to remove the butanol from the vicinity of the bacteria as soon as it is produced. Liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) was combined with the ABE fermentation for in situ product recovery, but the extractants with the highest affinity for butanol tend to be toxic to the bacteria. The application of LLE would also require the extractant to be sterilised prior to contact with the fermentation broth. Perstraction can overcome these problems due to a membrane separating the fermentation broth from the extractant. As an in situ product recovery technique for the ABE fermentation perstraction is still in its development stages. = Amino acids separation through the charged membrane = A membrane brings many new elements for the separation. Amino acids has been separated by perstraction.WYSS, A., VON STOCKAR, U. and MARISON, I.W., 2006. A novel reactive perstraction system based on liquid-core microcapsules applied to lipase-catalyzed biotransformations. Biotechnology and bioengineering, 93(1), pp. 28‚Äì39.ISONO, Y., FUKUSHIMA, K., KAWAKATSU, T. and NAKAJIMA, M., 1995. New selective perstraction system with charged membrane. Journal of Membrane Science, 105(3), pp. 293‚Äì297. Membranes did not only separate extractants and the primary solution but also were selective for amino acids. Charged membranes were used. So they selected amino acids by pKa. Besides the selectivity of a membrane is affected by its thickness, pore diameter and charge potential. The bigger pore is, the better amino acids permeate the membrane. The higher charge potential is, the bigger electrostatic rejection effects are. The thinner membrane, the less it is selective. = The clean groundwater = Pollutants can be deleted from groundwater by perstraction.ANONYMOUS, 1997. Groundwater monitor uses perstraction. Membrane Technology, 1997(90), pp. 3‚Äì4. Different techniques have been patented.ANONYMOUS A, 2012, United states patent.

Available: http://www.patentlens.net/daisy/patentlens/patentlens.html [10/6/2012] Organic compounds through a membrane has been concentrated from groundwater. The concentration factor is from 1 000 to 10 000 bringing 0.1 ppb concentrations to between 0.1 and 1.0 ppm. Besides the concentration of a contaminant has been analyzed in real-time. The membrane is polymer like polysulphane. The hole diameter is 300 ¬µm and thickness is 30 ¬µm. = Removal of pharmaceuticals from water = The pharmaceuticals pass sewage treatment plants. They like estrogen conjugates may cause problems. Drugs of the research were common, present in the aquatic environment and inability to be adequately removed by sewage treatment plants.WHELEHAN, M., VON STOCKAR, U. and MARISON, I.W., 2010. Removal of pharmaceuticals from water: Using liquid-core microcapsules as a novel approach. Water research, 44(7), pp. 2314‚Äì2324. There were seven different drugs in the research. Dibutyl sebacate and oleic acid formed liquid cores in capsules because they do not diffuse away from capsules and have affinity for drugs. Capsule external diameters were 740 ¬µm and 680 ¬µm and internal diameters were 570 ¬µm and 500 ¬µm. Agitation was 300 rpm. Equilibrium times were 30, 50 and 90 minutes. Since dibutyl sebacate and oleic acid were different affinity for drugs, they were used concurrently. Four drugs were extracted effectively for 40‚Äì50 minutes (at least 50% removed). Extraction rates did not change significantly above 150 rpm. Membrane thickness did not affected significantly. On the contrary the capsule size was remarkable for mass transfer. = Hydrophobic gelganamycin separated from aqueous media = An antibiotic called geldanamycin was separated from media by the capsular perstraction.WHELEHAN, M. and MARISON, I.W., 2011. Capsular perstraction as a novel methodology for the recovery and purification of geldanamycin. Biotechnology progress, 27(4), pp. 1068‚Äì1077. Geldanamycin is hydrophobic. Outer particle diameter varied from than less 500 to 750 ¬µm. Alginate formed the shell of capsule and its thickness varied from 30 to 90 ¬µm. Dibutyl sebacate or oleic acid as liquid core extracted geldanamycin well. The bigger agitation and thinner capsule membrane were, the faster transfer rate was. Geldanamycin was back-extracted from capsules. Dibutyl sebacate capsules were disposable because liquid core came out from capsules in the back-extraction. On the contrary oleic acid remained in capsules during the back-extraction when an extractant was saturated with oleic acid. Nevertheless, the presence of oleic acid in the back-extraction solution demanded more purification steps (precipitation, centrifugation and filtration). Oleic acid was removed because it prevents crystallization of geldanamycin. Therefore, geldanamycin was crystallized and the end product was highly purified. Enzymes can be immobilized to the capsule membrane. In this case the capsule external diameter was 500 ¬µm and internal diameter 300 ¬µm. The product of enzyme- catalyzed reaction can be concentrated to capsules and the end-product inhibition is low.WYSS, A., SEITERT, H., VON STOCKAR, U. and MARISON, I.W., 2005. Novel reactive perstraction system applied to the hydrolysis of penicillin G. Biotechnology and bioengineering, 91(2), pp. 227‚Äì236.

The district is focused on the junction of New Hampshire Route 10 and Court Street, which was historically a major through route. Court Street is flanked at the junction by a pair of large grassy common areas which are bounded by School Street and Route 10. Buildings, predominantly Federal in character and built in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, are arrayed around these commons, and historic buildings line Route 10 and Court Street for a short distance away from the commons. Prominent buildings in the district include the 1827 Federal-style First Congregational Church, the 1840 former courthouse that now houses the public library and local historical society, and the Romanesque Revival 1897 Haverhill Academy Junior High School building. The area declined in importance after the railroad bypassed it, resulting in the gradual relocation of civic functions to the Woodsville area. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Haverhill was the first major colonial settlement in northern New Hampshire, founded in 1763 by soldiers of the French and Indian War who recognized it for its farming potential. The oldest buildings in the district are houses built between about 1769 and the start of the American Revolutionary War. When Grafton County was established in 1769, Haverhill was named its shire towns, a role it continues to fulfill. Early civic buildings were placed in this area, which became the terminus of one of the main roads through interior New Hampshire, running from the seacoast to the Connecticut River (the road is now known in Haverhill as Court Street). In the early 19th century, the corner acquired all of the trappings of a county seat, with taverns and the homes and offices of lawyers. For many years the 1813 academy building also served as the courthouse. The decision in the mid-19th century to locate the railroad at Woodsville meant that economic and county functions were gradually moved there. In the 20th century, Haverhill Corner became an area of summer residences, and long-time resident Mildred Page made a bequest for the maintenance of the village's historic civic buildings.

Education Ian Quayle Jones was educated at Strathallan School in Perthshire, Scotland and the University of Edinburgh, graduating with a degree in law. Career Jones qualified as a solicitor and joined Cowans Stewart where he became a partner. In 1972 he moved to Ivory & Syme as a fund manager. Within a year he moved to the British Linen Bank, the merchant banking arm of the Bank of Scotland. Following several promotions, he was appointed director with responsibility for the investment department. Jones also managed the bank's investment company, Melville Street Investments (Edinburgh), which specialised in providing finance for unlisted companies. In 1981 Jones organised Scotland's first privatisation, Gleneagles Hotel, which was part of British Transport Hotels. In 1983, he formed his own company. =Quayle Munro= Ian Jones and Michael Munro established Quayle Munro in 1983 to provide professional financial services to companies in Scotland and the North of England. Initially, Jones and Munro were executive directors and Sir Alan Smith was chairman. Over time the firm developed three main areas of operation: corporate finance work for smaller plcs and large privately owned companies, including advice on capital- raising, mergers and acquisitions; an investment portfolio in listed and unlisted United Kingdom (UK) companies; and advising/funding private finance initiative (PFI) deals in Scotland. In the 1980s, Jones oversaw several large deals including Dawson International's ¬£650 million bid for Coats PLC and the listing of Shanks Group on the London Stock Exchange. Quayle Munro also advised the Scottish Office on the privatisation of ScotRail and the Scottish Bus Group, the disposal of the Scottish Development Agency's investment portfolio, the funding arrangements for the Skye Bridge and advised on the potential privatisation of water facilities in Scotland. The Skye bridge was the first private finance initiative deal in the United Kingdom. Quayle Munro became the preferred adviser for the majority of PFI deals in Scotland until the introduction of the Scottish Futures Trust in 2008.

The Works of M.Yu.Lermontov in 4 volumes. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura Publishers. Moscow, 1958. Vol. 2. Pp. 495-497. Summary A visiting uhlan falls in love with the 18-year-old wife of the old Tambov's treasurer and, after several attempts to woo her, 'wins' her from her husband in the game of cards. History On February 15, 1838 Lermontov informed M.A.Lopukhina (writing in French): \\"I've been to Zhukovsky and, following his request, brought him Tambov Teasurer's Wife. He took it to Vyazemsky, they read it together and liked it a lot. It will be printed in the next Sovremennik issue.\\" Since Lermontov speaks of the poem as if it had already been read by Lopukhina, it must have been finished by mid-January, when he left Moscow. The poem (signed \\"-v\\") was published in No.3 issue of Sovremennik, with both editorial (by Zhukovsky) and censorial cuts. The title was curtailed to just Kaznatcheysha (A Treasurer's Wife). The manuscript of the poem has been lost. None of the omitted lines has been restored since. The way the poem was treated outraged Lermontov. Ivan Panayev remembered: \\"...I found Lermontov at Krayevsky's greatly agitated. He [Lermontov] held a thin pink book of Sovremennik in his hands showing the intention to tear it apart, but Krayevsky wouldn't let him. \\"It's Devil knows what! - Lermontov was shouting, shaking the journal. - Is it permissible at all to do such things? That's unbelievable!\\" Then he sat at the table, took a large red pencil and on the sleeve of the journal where his Treasurer's Wife was published, drew some sort of caricature.\\" Panayev, I.I., Literature Memoirs.

Green Cornishware is a striped kitchenware brand trademarked to and manufactured by T.G. Green & Co Ltd. Originally introduced in the 1920s and manufactured in Church Gresley, Derbyshire, it was a huge success for the company and in the succeeding 30 years it was exported around the world. The company ceased production in June 2007 when the factory closed under the ownership of parent company The Tabletop Group. The range was revived in 2009 after T.G. Green was bought by a trio of British investors. Name The name \\"Cornishware\\" came from an observation by a T.G Green salesmen that the blue color used to decorate the dishware reminded him of the sky and sea in Cornwall. Cornwall was also the initial source for the clay to make the pottery.  History  T.G. Green & Co was founded by Thomas Goodwin Green of Boston, Lincolnshire in around 1864.Cornish Ware  Atterbury  Paul  2001  Cornish Ware & domestic pottery by T.G. Green of Church Gresley, Derbyshire  Richard Denis  Having made a fortune in Australia, Green returned to England to marry Mary Tenniel, the sister of Punch and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland illustrator Sir John Tenniel. He bought an existing pottery in Church Gresley from Henry Wileman, while on honeymoon in Scarborough Frederick Parker The exact date that Cornishware was created is vague, but it is known to have been introduced by Frederick Parker who joined Green's as a General Manager in 1919. Initially he introduced E-Blue Banded Wares, selling in china shops in 1922. The earliest mention of Cornishware by name is in a T.G. Green Trade Catalogue dated 1923. By the 1930s, the range was well established with a thriving export business. The pottery was widely sold throughout the UK through major department stores and independent shops. Cornish Ware Trex Jar Cornishware stockists carried a standard range of lettered jars, such as flour, sugar, salt, currants, sultanas, raisins, tea and coffee, but purchasers could request jars with customised wording (for instance, paprika, arrowroot, thyme, mace, viota, macaroni). The retailer would then send a request slip to the factory and customised jars would be created then sent back to the store. T.G. Green never kept records of these requests, so there is no complete list of customised jar produced. Former kitchenware range The signature colour was referred to as 'E.blue' ‚Äì meaning electric blue. and in 1959 Sunlit Yellow was introduced to the range. In the 1960s new designers were brought in from the Royal College of Art ‚Äì Scandinavian designer Berit Ternell and, most notably, Judith Onions. She restyled the Cornishware range to give it the distinctive shapes that are still in use today. Some of Onions' designs are held in the V&A; collection, as part of the Ceramics Study Galleries.  Cornishware today  After the Church Gresley factory closed in 2007, designer Perry Haydn Taylor and 'lifelong admirers' Charles Rickards and Paul Burston restored the brand. Today the new T.G.Green produces a range of Cornishware products in various colours, including the traditional blue and white stripes. A vintage Cornishware jar bearing the name 'Viota' (a company who manufactured boxed lemonade mix, cake mix and desiccated coconut ) Original vintage Cornishware is highly collectible, with pieces in black, green, orange, yellow, red, and blue pieces with rare lettering, selling for particularly high prices. A number of active Facebook groups as well as Pinterest sites and the appearance of Cornishware on many British television shows, ranging from The Great British Bake Off to The Young Ones have kept Cornishware very much in the public eye and still very popular to this day. Cornishware was extensively used in the 2015 film adaptation of Alan Bennett's The Lady in the Van. Lifetime collector Iain M Hambling who began collecting Cornishware in 1991 is the Official Historian & Archivist for Cornishware. After a working association with the four previous parent companies Iain now runs the Archive Office in Church Gresley and continually builds the online virtual museum recreating the missing catalogues of patterns.

Womer was a member of the 29th Ranger Battalion, the 101st Airborne Division and the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment (506th PIR). Throughout his service in the 101st Airborne Division, Womer was assigned to the Demolitions Platoon of the 506th PIR Regimental Headquarters Company in the section known officially as the First Demolitions Section and nicknamed the Filthy Thirteen. Known for his astuteness in battle, which he attributed to his rigorous training by British Commandos while in the 29th Ranger Battalion, Womer was never injured in combat. Womer was among the members of the Filthy Thirteen who parachuted into Normandy, France, on 6 June 1944 as part of the Normandy Invasion (Operation Overlord). He was the only one that remained in the Filthy Thirteen and participated in Operation Market-Garden in September 1944, the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, and the advance on Hitler's home in Berchtesgaden, Germany, in 1945. At the time of his death on December 28, 2013, Womer was the last living member of the original Filthy Thirteen. In May 2012, Womer's biography, Fighting With the Filthy Thirteen: The World War II Story of Jack Womer: Ranger and Paratrooper, co-written by close friend Stephen C. DeVito, was published.  Personal life  Womer was born on 18 June 1917 in Lewistown, Pennsylvania, as the fourth child of Methodist parents‚Äî mainly of Dutch descent. His father, William Walker (‚ÄúWalk‚Äù) Womer, worked as an open-hearth melter in a steel mill in Lewistown. Womer's mother, Roxie Womer, was a housewife. A few months after Womer was born, Roxie became ill and sent Womer to Sunbury, Pennsylvania, to live with her sister Dolsie. In 1922, Womer was still living in Sunbury with his aunt; his father decided to move the family from Lewistown, Pennsylvania to a small row house in Sparrows Point, Maryland. In 1930 the eight-member Womer family relocated to a larger, single family house in Dundalk, Maryland. Womer attended public and private schools. He was quite athletic and was awarded an athletic scholarship to attend the Franklin Day School, a private high school in Baltimore, Maryland, where he enjoyed dancing in nightclubs. During the late 1930s Womer was known as the best jitter-bugger in Baltimore, and was nicknamed ‚Äújitterbug‚Äù. Womer began his employment in 1936 at Bethlehem Steel and, except for the four-and-a-half years he served in the military during World War II, continued working there until he retired in 1982. Womer married Theresa Cook in November 1945 in Saint Patrick's Catholic Church in Baltimore. They remained married until Theresa's death in 1987. They had two children; a son, John, and a daughter, Ellen. John died in the early 1990s. Soon after Theresa's death, Womer moved from their home in Dundalk to a single family house in Fort Howard, Maryland. Womer died at 96 years of age on 28 December 2013.  Military service Womer was drafted into the U.S. Army on 25 April 1941. He was assigned to the 175th Infantry Regiment, Company C, of the 29th Infantry Division. From April to September 1941, he trained with the 29th Infantry Division at Fort Meade, Maryland.Naamloos document A year later, the Division was sent to Europe by sea. Approximately half of the Division was sent in late September 1942 on the Queen Mary. In early October 1942, Womer and the rest of the Division were sent to Europe on the Queen Elizabeth. The 29th Infantry Division billeted him at Tidworth Barracks, an old military camp in Wiltshire, England, and he continued to undertake training exercises. =29th Provisional Ranger Battalion= In late November or early December 1942, it was announced that a new Ranger battalion, the 29th Provisional Ranger Battalion, was to be formed within the 29th Infantry Division. Men for the new battalion were chosen from the 29th Infantry Division, and soldiers within the Division interested in being considered for it were asked to volunteer. Only those volunteers who met the very strict physical and psychological requirements would be allowed to try out for the battalion. Womer was among the relatively few volunteers who passed the initial screenings and were allowed to continue with the training. The 29th Provisional Ranger Battalion volunteers trained in the Tidworth area from December 1942 until late January 1943. In late January 1943, the volunteers were sent to Scotland for five weeks of intensive training under combat experienced British Commando instructors at Glen Spean.Local World War II hero Jack Womer dies at 96 Womer and other volunteers who completed the training officially became 29th Rangers and were sent back to England. Womer said this training was the most brutal he ever experienced, but credited it for enabling him to think strategically and tactically during combat, and saving his life and the lives of others. In early September 1943, Womer was asked to go to the British Commando Depot at Dorlin House in Acharacle, Argyll, to assist in the training of Ranger recruits. For nearly three weeks, he trained with other British Commando and Royal Marine units in amphibious assault landings at the six very tough assault courses. In October 1943, the 29th Provisional Ranger Battalion was disbanded and the men returned to their original units within the 29th Infantry Division. Womer returned to Company C of the 175th Infantry Regiment. =101st Airborne Division and the Filthy Thirteen = D-day assault routes into Normandy. Americans of the 101st Engineers near Wiltz, Luxembourg, January 1945. Shortly after he returned to Company C of the 175th Infantry Regiment, Womer wanted to be reassigned to a more elite unit. He volunteered to become a paratrooper with the 101st Airborne Division. Womer had heard that William Myers, a Rangers sergeant, had also joined the 101st Airborne Division. Knowing Myers had been assigned to the Demolitions Platoon within the Regimental Headquarters Company of the 101st Airborne Division's 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, Womer joined the Demolitions Platoon. The Demolitions Platoon was composed of three sections. Myers was in a section that was already complete but the First Demolitions Section‚Äîknown as the Filthy Thirteen‚Äîwas short of men. Jake McNiece, the buck sergeant of the Filthy Thirteen, had heard that Womer was trained as a Commando and had been in the 29th Ranger Battalion. Impressed with Womer's credentials, McNiece requested his assignment to the Filthy Thirteen. 101st Airborne Paratroopers inspect a broken glider. With the Filthy Thirteen, Womer participated in Operation Overlord, and later in Operation Market-Garden and the Battle of the Bulge. Womer relied heavily on his Commando training during these battles; he credits it with his own survival and enabling him to keep many other men from being killed. After Jake McNiece left the Filthy Thirteen in December 1944, Womer was promoted to buck sergeant to fill McNiece's position, which he maintained at the outset of the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 until the end of the war. Womer was the only member of the Filthy Thirteen to participate in the Normandy Invasion, Operation Market-Garden, the Battle of the Bulge, and to advance on Adolf Hitler‚Äôs home in Berchtesgaden, Germany, while a member of the Filthy Thirteen.  Post-World War II  Womer was discharged from the military in September 1945.TogetherWeServed - Sgt Jack Neitz Womer He returned to his parents' home in Dundalk and to his job at Bethlehem Steel in Sparrows Point. In November 1945 he married his fianc√©e, Theresa Cook. He retired in 1982 after more than forty years at Bethlehem Steel. In June 2003, Womer was contacted by Stephen C. DeVito, after DeVito obtained an original photograph of Womer with six other men taken in February 1943, when they were training to become 29th Rangers. Womer and DeVito became friends and co-wrote Womer's biography, Fighting with the Filthy Thirteen, which was published in May 2012 by Casemate Publishing.  Awards and recognitions  Womer received many medals and decorations from the United States government for his military service.Bastogne Battle of the Bulge - News In 2012, out of gratitude for his military service, people in France petitioned the French government to award him the French Legion of Honor medal, the highest medal awarded by the French government.

Biography Born into a priestly family in Biharr√≥sa, Bihar County (now Ro»ôia, Bihor County), he enrolled in the Theological Institute of Arad, where in 1893 he took part in protests against the Hungarian government's dismissal from the faculty of Bishop Vasile Mangra. Graduating in 1898, he enrolled in the doctoral program at Czernowitz University upon the recommendation of Bishop Iosif Goldi»ô. In 1905, he obtained his doctorate with distinction and returned to Arad, intending to begin a university career. In 1906, when fourteen members of the Romanian National Party were elected to the Hungarian Parliament, his expressed support for their policies led him to clash with the Institute's director. The same year, he was named school inspector for the Arad Diocese, later taking charge of cultural affairs. He was ordained deacon in 1908 and priest in 1910, being accorded the rank of archpriest the same year.\\"Ciuhandu, Gheorghe\\", entry in Mircea PƒÉcurariu, Dic»õionarul Teologilor Rom√¢ni, Editura Univers Enciclopedic, Bucharest, 1996 He took part in the December 1918 assembly that marked the union of Transylvania with Romania, where a solemn prayer he had written for the occasion was read aloud. The following March, in Sibiu, he took part in the founding congress of the Transylvanian Orthodox Clergy Association, where he was the first to officially propose raising the church to the level of a Patriarchate. In 1922, he was elected the association's president. In 1939, under the National Renaissance Front regime, he was elected to the Romanian Senate.

All of South Carolina's executive officers were up for election as well as both United States Senate seats, and all of South Carolina's seven seats in the United States House of Representatives. Primary elections were held on June 10, 2014 and primary runoffs were held on June 24. Governor Incumbent Republican Governor Nikki Haley ran for re-election to a second term. Democratic State Senator Vincent Sheheen, the nominee in 2010 ran again. Republican-turned-Independent Tom Ervin, an attorney, former State Representative and former circuit court judge ran, but withdrew in the final week and endorsed Sheheen. Other candidates included Libertarian businessman Steve French; and former NFL player Morgan Bruce Reeves of the United Citizens Party. Haley won re-election. Lieutenant Governor This was the last election in which the lieutenant governor was elected separately from the Governor. Republican Ken Ard, who was elected in 2010, resigned the office in March 2012 while under investigation for ethics charges. He was succeeded by a fellow Republican, President pro tempore of the South Carolina Senate Glenn F. McConnell. McConnell had planned to run, but withdrew from the race in January 2014 and was announced as the next President of the College of Charleston in March, a position he took up in June. The state constitution requires that the Senate President pro tempore become Lieutenant Governor in the event of a vacancy but McConnell's successor as President pro tempore, Republican State Senator John E. Courson, expressed no desire to give up his Senate seat to serve as Lieutenant Governor for six months. He went as far as resigning as President pro tempore, to avoid becoming Lieutenant Governor, a position widely regarded as one of the weakest in the state. There was much confusion as to what would happen next, with McConnell saying he would delay his resignation so as not to leave the state \\"in a constitutional crisis\\" and Courson and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Larry A. Martin saying that they knew of no Senator who would want to become Lieutenant Governor for six months. The dispute was finally ended when Democrat Yancey McGill agreed to become Senate President pro tempore, and then Lieutenant Governor. After he ascended to that office, Republican Hugh K. Leatherman, Sr. became the new Senate President pro tempore. Businessman Mike Campbell, who lost the runoff for Lieutenant Governor in 2010, businessman Pat McKinney, former Attorney General of South Carolina and candidate for Governor in 2010 Henry McMaster and minister Ray Moore ran for the Republican nomination. As no candidate won a majority of the vote, a runoff was held. A recount had been scheduled to take place as the difference between second-placed Pat McKinney and third- placed Mike Campbell was only 0.41%, but McKinney withdrew from the race, citing personal reasons. Campbell thus faced first-placed Henry McMaster in the runoff. State Representative Bakari Sellers ran for the Democrats. McMaster won the general election. Attorney General Incumbent Republican Attorney General Alan Wilson ran for re-election to a second term in office. Attorney, President of the National Federation of the Blind of South Carolina and candidate for South Carolina's 7th congressional district in 2012 Parnell Diggs ran as the Democratic nominee. Wilson defeated him and won re-election. Secretary of State Map showing the results of the 2014 South Carolina Secretary of State general election by county. Incumbent Republican Secretary of State Mark Hammond is running for re-election to a fourth term in office. Nonprofit consultant Ginny Deerin ran as the Democratic nominee. She was endorsed by the Club for Growth, a conservative political organization that usually supports Republicans. She was the first ever Democrat running for statewide office to have been endorsed by them. However, Hammond still won re- election. Treasurer Incumbent Republican Treasurer Curtis M. Loftis, Jr. is running for re-election to a second term in office. Brian Adams ran against Loftis, Jr. in the Republican primary. No Democrat filed to run for the office. Loftis won re-election. Comptroller General Incumbent Republican Richard Eckstrom is running for re-election to a fourth term in office. He was being challenged in the Republican primary by Robert D. Shelley, but Shelley withdrew. Kyle Herbert is running for the Democrats. Eckstrom won re-election. Superintendent of Education Incumbent Republican Superintendent of Education Mick Zais did not run for re-election to a second term in office. Lee Atwater's widow Sally Atwater, Anderson County School Board member Gary Burgess, South Carolina Department of Education official Meka Bosket Childs, Amy Cofield, candidate for the State House in 2010 Sheri Few, Don Jordan, Charleston County School Board member and candidate for South Carolina's 1st congressional district in 2013 Elizabeth Moffly and former State Representative Molly Mitchell Spearman ran for the Republican nomination. As no candidate won a majority, a runoff was held between the top two finishers, Molly Mitchell Spearman and Sally Atwater. Awtwater was considered to be the frontrunner, until she called conservative talk show host Russ Cassell on News Radio WORD to talk about her candidacy. In the \\"awkward\\", \\"evasive\\" and \\"awful, incomprehensible, it-should-force-her-to-drop-out-of-the-race\\" interview, she seemed unable to give answers to basic questions about sex education and the teaching of evolution, to Cassell's amazement. After Awtater hung up, Cassell concluded: \\"Folks, I don't want to be brutal, I don't want to be mean. What you have just heard is an example of a person running for public office on name recognition only, who is clueless.\\" Atwater subsequently apologised for her performance and the interview, which was uploaded to YouTube, went viral. Atwater subsequently declined to debate Spearman before the runoff, with a spokesman for Spearman saying that \\"given [Atwater's] debate performance in the primary and her recent radio interview on WORD-FM, we can understand why she has made this political calculation. Atwater was also the subject of a lawsuit alleging that as a teacher she \\"routinely harassed, physically assaulted, and psychologically tormented\\" a disabled student. Atwater's campaign dismissed the lawsuit as \\"baseless and frivolous\\". =Endorsements= South Carolina Department of Education official Montrio M. Belton, Sr., Sheila C. Gallagher, State Representative Jerry Govan and Tom Thompson ran for the Democratic nomination. As no candidate won a majority, a runoff was held between the top two finishers, Sheila C. Gallagher and Tom Thompson. Ed Murray ran as the American Party nominee. Spearman won the general election. Commissioner of Agriculture Incumbent Republican Commissioner of Agriculture Hugh Weathers, who was appointed to the position in September 2004, ran for re-election to a third full term in office. Joe Farmer ran against Weathers in the Republican primary. Emile DeFelice of the American Party and David Edmond of the United Citizens Party also ran. No Democrat filed to run for the office. Weathers won re-election. Adjutant General Incumbent Republican Adjutant General Robert E. Livingston, Jr. ran for re-election to a second term in office. James Breazeale ran against Livingston, Jr. in the Republican primary. No Democrat filed to run for the office. Livigston won re-election. Because South Carolina voters approved Amendment 2 in the 2014 general election, this will be the last time that the adjutant general is popularly elected. Because South Carolina is the only state in the union to elect its adjutant general, this is the final time that a state adjutant general will stand for election in the United States, barring future state constitutional changes. United States Senate ;Regularly- scheduled election Incumbent Republican Senator Lindsey Graham is running for re-election to a third term in office. He faced six challengers in the Republican primary: pastor and businessman Det Bowers, State Senator Lee Bright, businessman and candidate for South Carolina's 3rd congressional district in 2010 Richard Cash, attorney, Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army Reserve and candidate for lieutenant governor in 2010 Bill Connor, attorney Benjamin Dunn and businesswoman and author Nancy Mace. Graham won the primary with 56% of the vote, negating the need for a runoff. State Senator Brad Hutto defeated entrepreneur Jay Stamper in the Democratic primary. Former Republican State Treasurer Thomas Ravenel is running as an Independent. Libertarian Victor Kocher is also running. ;Special election Incumbent Republican Senator Tim Scott, who was appointed to the office in January 2013 after Jim DeMint resigned, is running for election to the remaining part of the term. The seat will be up for election to a six-year term in 2016. Scott defeated Randall Young in the Republican primary. Richland County Councilwoman Joyce Dickerson defeated former York County Councilman Sidney Moore and attorney and candidate for South Carolina's 7th congressional district in 2012 Harry Pavilack for the Democratic nomination. Independents Brandon Armstrong, a painting contractor, and Jill Bossi, former Vice President of the American Red Cross, are also running. United States House of Representatives All of South Carolina's seven seats in the United States House of Representatives will be up for election in 2014. Advisory Questions and Referendums Several advisory questions were placed on the primary election ballots to advise the major state parties on the positions of their membership on major policy questions. In the general election, voters also voted on two constitutional amendments. All passed with heavy majorities. =Primary Advisory Questions= Democratic Advisory Question One asked primary voters whether each state, rather than Congress, should determine whether to allow and how to regulate online gaming. Democratic Advisory Question Two asked whether gaming laws should be \\"modified\\" to fund transportation needs in the state, rather than tax increases. Democratic Advisory Question Three asked whether medical marijuana should be legalized for the treatment of \\"severe, chronic illnesses.\\" Republican Question 1 asked whether the \\"privileges and immunities\\" of South Carolina citizens under the state constitution should be extended to unborn fetuses. Republican Question 2 asked whether the state income tax should be reduced by 1.4% a year until it no longer exists. =Constitutional Amendments= In the general election, voters voted on two amendments. Amendment One amended the state's constitution to allow non-profit organizations to hold raffles for fundraising purposes. It passed. Amendment Two amended the state's constitution to make the Adjutant General appointed by the Governor, rather than popularly elected. It passed.

He broke the pole vault world record both indoors and outdoors and was also a good high jumper. He later became involved in politics and served as the Republican Party's state chairman in Arizona for two years. Athletic career Although Brown had tried pole vaulting early on, he only took it up seriously after being cut from the basketball team of his high school, Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. In May 1931, he cleared 13 ft in (4.08 m) at an interscholastic meet at the Harvard Stadium, a new national high school pole vault record. By doing so, he was following in the footsteps of his uncle Bobby Gardner, who in 1912 had become the first jumper to clear 13 feet (3.96 m). Brown graduated from Phillips Academy in 1931 and went to Yale, which at the time was a top pole vaulting school thanks to its coach A. C. Gilbert. As a freshman in 1932, he jumped 13 ft 10 in (4.21 m) to win the Eastern Olympic Tryouts; at the final Olympic Trials in Palo Alto, he only cleared 13 ft 4 in (4.06 m) and tied for seventh with nine other athletes, failing to qualify for the Olympic team. Brown helped Yale win the team title at the 1933 IC4A indoor championships. He not only jumped a meet record 13 ft in (4.21 m) to tie for first in the pole vault with his Yale teammate Wirt Thompson, he also tied George Spitz of the favored New York University for first place in the high jump. At the national indoor championships, Brown shared first place with another Yale teammate, Franklin Pierce, at 13 ft 6 in (4.11 m). He capped his indoor season on March 15, jumping 14 ft in (4.31 m) at Madison Square Garden for a new indoor world record. At the 1933 outdoor IC4A meet Brown pulled a tendon high jumping, but still shared first place with four others in the pole vault, including Olympic champion Bill Miller and outdoor world record holder Bill Graber. Brown won his first national outdoor title that summer, tying with Matt Gordy at 14 ft (4.26 m). He broke his own indoor world record on February 17, 1934, with a jump of 14 ft 4 in (4.37 m), again at Madison Square Garden. That summer he repeated as both IC4A champion and national outdoor champion. Brown became captain of the Yale track team in 1935, and won both the pole vault and the high jump at that winter's indoor IC4A meet. In his final collegiate competition on June 1, 1935, at the outdoor IC4A Championships ‚Äì the same meet where his uncle had broken the world record exactly twenty-three years earlier ‚Äì Brown cleared a bar set at 14 ft in (4.39 m), breaking Graber's world record of 14 ft in (4.37 m). (Earlier that spring Graber had jumped 14 ft in (4.41 m), but that jump was void for record purposes since the runway had been elevated by two inches (5 cm).) Later that summer, Brown broke the British all-comers record on two occasions and won the AAA Championships. A panel of experts viewed him as likely to make the American team for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, but he retired from the sport without attempting to qualify. Later life and political career In 1946, Brown and his family took what was intended to be a six-week winter holiday in Arizona. They ended up staying there permanently, buying the 40,000-acre Santa Rita Ranch south of Tucson in Pima County; Brown thus left behind a job with Booz Allen Hamilton to become a rancher. Brown soon became involved in Republican politics in Pima County and Arizona, serving in the Arizona State Legislature from 1955 to 1959. When Richard Kleindienst resigned as chairman of the Arizona Republican Party due to business pressures in early 1963, Brown was endorsed to be his successor by top Republican leaders, including Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater. Although challenged by Evan Mecham, who had been the Republican candidate in the previous year's Senate elections, the more moderate Brown was selected for the chairmanship. He was Arizona party chairman when Goldwater became the state's first candidate for the presidency. He was also a delegate at the 1964 Republican National Convention, and in September 1964 he was appointed to the executive branch of the Republican National Committee. He resigned the chairmanship in the spring of 1965 due to the demands of his business life, as well as the inconvenience of commuting from the Tucson area to the state capital of Phoenix. In 1972, Brown was named the Southern Arizona chairman of the Committee to Re-elect the President. Business activities In addition to his career as a cattle rancher, Brown was chairman of the board and the leading stockholder of American Atomics Corporation, a Tucson-based company that used radioactive tritium to make luminescent tubes for clocks, watches and signs. Although the company's then-CEO Peter J. Biehl stated in 1977 that the radioactivity presented no danger, American Atomics was controversially shut down in the summer of 1979 by Governor Bruce Babbitt after high levels of radioactive tritium were measured in Tucson near its factory. Critics also claimed the firm had been more concerned with profits than public safety. Brown also served as director of the Southern Arizona Bank and Trust Company. Personal life Brown married Katherine McLennan, daughter of Marsh & McLennan co-founder Donald R. McLennan, at Lake Forest, Illinois on July 3, 1937. The couple had two sons (Keith Jr. and Steve) and two daughters (Julia and Katherine), with the first three children born in Illinois and the youngest, Steve, after the family's relocation to Arizona. They lived on their Santa Rita Ranch until 1967, when they moved to Tucson; they bought another, smaller ranch there after selling the Santa Rita Ranch in 1971. After Katherine's death in 1982, Brown married Mary Lou Stevens. They moved to Del Mar, California, where he died of emphysema in July 1991.

Another beta bend ribbon occurs in the GTPase-activating protein for Rho in the active, but not the inactive, form of the enzyme. The beta bend ribbon, which incorporates the catalytic arginine, allows its side-chain guanidino group to approach the active site and enhance enzyme activity.Rittinger K, Walker PA, Eccleston JF, Smerdon SJ, Gamblin SJ.

Summary  \\"A claim to set aside a deed of family arrangement and deed of gift transferring a property from a mother to her daughter based on undue influence failed where the kind of trust in play between the parties was no more than a trust that a daughter would keep her promise to her mother to pay her a sum to buy out her share, and there had been no actual undue influence and the mother had accepted that she was taking a risk.\\"  Abstract  \\"In conjoined actions, the court was required to determine issues concerning ownership and beneficial interest in a property, and priority over a registered charge. In the first action, the claimant (T) was the mother of the defendant (F). T, who was a widow, had shared her property with F and her family, and allowed them to build a substantial self- contained extension to live in, paid for by F. T acknowledged that the extension belonged to F. F and her family subsequently expressed an interest in moving to Spain, taking T with them. At that time, F did not have the money to fund the purchase of a Spanish property unless her part of the value of the property was realised. It was agreed that F would buy out T's share of the property for ¬£200,000 and then mortgage the property and rent it out to cover the mortgage. T would then receive the ¬£200,000 and F would use the excess to purchase a Spanish home. T lent F ¬£20,000 to put a deposit on a Spanish property. F then applied for a buy-to-let mortgage from a company (X) which was the claimant in the second action, wrongly stating that she owned the property at that time. Following repeated requests for reassurance from F, T subsequently transferred the property to F via a deed of family arrangement and deed of gift. She then decided that she no longer wanted to move to Spain, and began searching instead for her own bungalow. When the mortgage moneys were released to F by X, F informed T that she could not pay her the ¬£200,000 because she had been advised that if T were to die within seven years she would have to pay inheritance tax on her part of the money. F offered T ¬£60,000, with the remainder to be paid in seven years. A dispute then arose between T and F, as a result of which the property was not let out. In consequence, the mortgage was not paid and arrears amounted. X repossessed the property and obtained a money judgment against F. T claimed to be entitled to set aside the documents by which F came to be registered as proprietor of the property and that her right to do so had priority over the registered charge because it was an overriding interest. It fell to be determined whether (i) F was entitled to any beneficial interest in the property, and the extent of any such interest; (ii) T was entitled to set aside the deed of family arrangements and deed of gift to F on the ground of undue influence; (iii) if T was so entitled, her right to do so was binding on X; (iv) F had repaid to T the sum lent to pay for the deposit on the Spanish property.\\" Judgment F was entitled to a beneficial interest in the property based on proprietary estoppel. There had been a mutual understanding between T and F that if F built an extension it would belong to her. T had failed to establish that F had not acted in reliance on that representation, and F established her claim to ownership of the extension. (2) Unacceptable conduct amounting to undue influence might arise out of a relationship between two persons where one had acquired over the other a measure of influence or ascendancy, of which the ascendant person took unfair advantage. Whether a transaction had been brought about by undue influence was a question of fact, applied. On the evidence, there had not been a complete relationship of trust and confidence between T and F, as T had appreciated that she was taking a risk, although F had promised to pay T the ¬£200,000. The kind of trust in play was no more than a trust that a daughter would keep her promise to her mother. No presumption of undue influence arose, therefore, and the burden was on T to prove that F had actually used undue influence to procure that the transaction went ahead. The fact that F's promise had been repeatedly and sincerely given did not amount to undue influence. Accordingly, the claim to set aside the deed of family arrangement and the gift of the legal title had to fail. (3) Even if, contrary to that finding, T had been entitled to set aside the transaction on the ground of undue influence, that would not have affected the registered estate at the date of the charge in favour of X because the claim based on undue influence would not crystallise until F's misappropriation of the mortgage moneys and the equity would not arise until that time. (4) F had not repaid the ¬£20,000 that T had lent to her and it was still owing.

By the terms of this treaty the U.S. recognized Cuban sovereignty over the territory of the Isle of Pines off the southern coast of the island of Cuba, which since 1978 has been known as (Isle of Youth). Background Following the conclusion of hostilities in the Cuban War for Independence from Spain, the United States, which had entered the war in its final months in support of the Cubans, required that the new Republic of Cuba meet several conditions before the U.S. would withdraw its troops from Cuba. These conditions were set out in a U.S. law known as the Platt Amendment and the one that applied to the Isle of Pines read: \\"That the Isle of Pines shall be omitted from the proposed constitutional boundaries of Cuba, the title thereto being left to future adjustment by treaty.\\" A New York Times editorial said this reflected the fact that the Isle of Pines had not been expressly considered during negotiations with Spain nor its status made clear in the treaty with Spain. It noted that the island's ties to Cuba and the province of Havana were so clearly established that the U.S. government must be considering \\"taking it only by purchase\\" because \\"It does not appear that it could be lawfully taken any other way.\\" But public discussion in the U.S. did contemplate the Isle's attractions: When the first Constitution of the Republic of Cuba was initially adopted on February 21, 1901, it did not mention the Isle of Pines as part of the nation's territory. The Cuban Constitutional Convention accepted the Platt Amendment's provisions on a narrow vote in May 1901. After U.S. forces handed administration of the nation to the Cuban government on May 20, 1901, the Association of American Settlers on the Isle of Pines was quick to complain that they lacked government services and were \\"practically in a state of chaos as far as civil order is concerned\\", though some in the U.S. did not take the complaint seriously, calling the Isle \\"a country which appears to exist at the present time solely for the purpose of supplying material for the comedian\\". One attorney for U.S. companies doing business on Isle of Pines called for government action but undercut his argument: \\"There is absolutely no form of Government on the island, and the only authority visible is a guard consisting of eight constables representing the Cuban Government. So far as I know, they have never made an arrest, because the people of Isle of Pines are most orderly.\\" Treaty U.S. Secretary of State John Hay had served as U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. He had insisted then that the U.S. acted \\"from the highest motives of humanity and in no sense as a war of conquest\\" and considered the annexation of Isle of Pines by the U.S. \\"an iniquity\\". On July 2, 1903, he and Gonzalo de Quesada, Cuban Ambassador to the United States, signed treaties securing the U.S. right to lease lands at Guantanamo Bay and recognizing Cuban sovereignty over Isle of Pines. The Cuban Senate ratified both on July 16. In the U.S. Senate, Senator Boies Penrose led the opposition to the Isle of Pines treaty on behalf of U.S. business interests, including some large investors and a friend who had built a large mansion. He claimed they had received assurances of U.S. sovereignty from the Military Governor of Cuba General Leonard Wood. When the United States Senate ratified only the lease treaty and failed to act on Isle of Pines treaty within the time the treaty allowed, Hay and de Quesada signed a second version addressing the status of Isle of Pines on March 2, 1904. It avoided specifying a time within which it needed to be ratified. Ratification For years the U.S. Senate did not ratify the treaty, though from 1903 on every U.S. President and Secretary of State urged its ratification and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent it to the floor and recommended its ratification three times. In 1907, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a case disputing whether goods imported from the Isle of Pines should be subject to a tariff \\"on articles imported from foreign countries\\". Without addressing the issue of sovereignty per se, in Pearcy v. Stranahan Chief Justice Melville Fuller found for a unanimous court that the United States had never exercised sovereignty over the Isle of Pines and that since being ceded by Spain it had been under the de facto jurisdiction of Cuba, and it was therefore foreign territory for tariff purposes.Percy v. Stranahan, 205 U.S. 257 (1907). The treaty was brought up again for ratification by the U.S. Senate in February 1924. Senator William E. Borah argued that U.S. citizens‚Äì700 of the island's 4,250 residents were U.S. citizens‚Äìowned 90% of the land and had invested there in anticipation that Isle of Pines would enjoy a status similar to that of Puerto Rico. Almost all of them had arrived since the Cubans had agreed to delay resolution of the island's legal status, though few were thought to remain for more than a few years. Senator Royal S. Copeland argued that Isle of Pines had strategic value and could serve as \\"a naval, military and air base of greatest importance to our protection of the [Panama] Canal\\". He proposed paying Cuba for its administration of the island. A committee of Americans who owned land in Isle of Pines visited President Calvin Coolidge and told him that ceding the island to Cuba would constitute \\"a blot on American history\\". Cuban legislators argued that the original negotiations had recognized that the sovereignty of the Isle of Pines was part and parcel of the granting of the Guantanamo lease. Some 65 of the 116 members of the Cuban House of Representatives wrote a letter calling for ratification of the treaty. It said that were the treaty rejected \\"the Republic of Cuba surely would have the right to ask the immediate evacuation of the naval stations established on Cuban territory\\". A committee of Cuban businessmen called for ratification, described the Isle's inhabitants as Cubans who fought for independence from Spain, and cited the joint resolution adopted by the U.S. Congress in 1898, the Teller Amendment, that disavowed any U.S. intention to exercise sovereignty over Cuba. They disputed any attempt to divorce the island of Cuba from its thousands of adjacent islands and keys. Coolidge argued without reserve for ratification. Writing in The American Journal of International Law in 1923, international law scholar James Brown Scott noted that American residents of Isle of Pines should by now be accustomed to Cuban rule. He said that whether the treaty is ratified or not, \\"Cuba exercises its sovereignty over the island and doubtless will continue to do so. The proposed treaty therefore has merely a sentimental value, but sentiment is perhaps the strongest bond between nations ...\\" The treaty was ratified by the United States Senate on March 13, 1925. Cuban President Alfredo Zayas and President- elect Gerardo Machado praised its action, as did newspapers throughout Latin America. In 1925 in Foreign Affairs, Benjamin H. Williams praised the ratification: References External links * Treaty between the United States and Cuba for the Adjustment of Title to the Isle of Pines, The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 19, No. 3, Supplement: Official Documents (Jul., 1925), pp. 95‚Äì98 Category:Treaties of the United States Category:Treaties of Cuba Category:Cuba‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:1925 in the United States Category:Treaties entered into force in 1925 Category:Isla de la Juventud ","title":"Hay-Quesada Treaty"},{"id":"42370095","text":"Rica-rica (or sometimes simply called rica) is a type of Southeast Asian hot and spicy bumbu (spice mixture) found in Manado cuisine of North Sulawesi, Indonesia.

Four of the thirteen major buildings are public facilities, while eight are residences and one is a store. Two of the public buildings have been repurposed: the town hall is located in a building that was a chapel in 1909, and the public library is located in a building that was built as a grange hall in 1915. Most of the residential structures were built in the first half of the 19th century. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The town of Hebron was incorporated in 1792 out of portions of neighboring towns. Its first public land was the village cemetery, which was laid out soon after incorporation. The town common was acquired by the town in 1799 from Evan Bartlett and Deacon Hobart. It was located for its proximity to what were then natural transportation routes, on the banks of Newfound Lake and the Cockermouth River, which empties into the lake a short way east of the village. In the 19th century, the village flourished economically, in part due to the founding of small-scale water- powered industries on a nearby stream. The common remained largely as originally configured, with the only major alteration the donation of a portion for the establishment of Hebron Academy in 1839.

In the 19th century, pastila was made from sourish Russian apples such as Antonovka or mashed Northern berries (lingonberry, rowan, currants) sweetened with honey or sugar and lightened with egg whites. The paste was baked in the Russian oven for many hours, then arranged in several layers inside an alder box and then left to dry in the same oven.–í. –í. –ü–æ—Ö–ª—ë–±–∫–∏–Ω. –ö—É–ª–∏–Ω–∞—Ä–Ω—ã–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å. –¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–ø–æ–ª–∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ, 2002 (William Pokhlyobkin.

The cheapest pastila was made with honey instead of sugar. The Russian stove afforded two days of steadily diminishing heat to bake the fruit paste. A Tatar variety was strained through a fine sieve, which helped keep apple seeds intact.–õ–µ–æ–Ω–∏–¥ –í–∞—Å–∏–ª—å–µ–≤–∏—á –ë–µ–ª–æ–≤–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π. –≠–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ –∏ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏: XVIII- –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–æ XX –≤. –û–õ–ú–ê-–ü–†–ï–°–°, 2003. . –°–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ (Leonid Belovinsky, Encyclopaedic dictionary of Russian life and history: From the 18th to the beginning of the 20th century.

According to William Pokhlyobkin, this Soviet-style pastila does not depend on the unique properties of the peasant stove and is markedly inferior to its homemade predecessors. It was ultimately eclipsed in popularity by zefir, which is made from similar ingredients but with whipped egg whites and gelling agents. In the 2010s, traditional pastila is regaining its popularity, with the Kolomna and especially Belyov versions widely available commercially.http://www.forbes.ru/svoi-biznes/istorii- uspekha/310831-sladkoe-mesto-kak-proizvodstvo-pastily-iz-promysla- prevratilos-v Production in Kolomna Kolomna claims to be the birthplace of original \\"white-foam\\" pastila and maintains a museum and a museum factory dedicated to history and traditions of pastila production.Website of the Pastila MuseumWebsite of the Pastila Museum Factory The museum occupies a merchant house dating from ca. 1800, while the museum factory is located in a historical factory building. Rzhev and Belyov used to be known as other important centres of production. Kolomna has been hand-made from apples for more than three hundred years. The process included whipping apple puree with egg whites and drying the paste in a stove. The finished product could be stored for many years. In 1735 the first pastila factory (pastilnaya) was set up. Unfortunately, the pastila recipes and the product itself were forgotten after the Russian Revolution. In 2008, during the European skating championship in Kolomna, the project \\"History with flavor\\" was implemented, which resulted in the revival of Kolomna pastila production process. The forsaken symbol of Kolomna was regained with the opening of the pastila factory and the museum that followed. The museum was set up in a historical building in the old part of the city. In the building next to it one can find the factory itself. During the theatrical performance that accompanies excursion visitors are offered a number of unique sorts of pastila. There is also another museum where tourists can both listen to the story of pastila and buy a box of traditional Russian dessert. The museum is situated at 13A, Posadskaya St., Kolomna, Moscow region. See also * List of Russian desserts * Pestil  References   External links   Paul Duvernet.

The name \\"Pau Grande\\" means \\"big log\\" or \\"big stick\\" in Portuguese. Pau Grande is located by the Range of the Organs. The district is famous for being the homeland of the international football legend Man√© Garrincha.  History  By 1848, the land where Pau Grande lays used to belong to four siblings. The district's name comes from one large tree that grew close to the gate of one of the siblings' cottage. In August 11, 1848, three of the owners sold their lands to the ex state minister Aureliano de Souze e Oliveira Coutinho. The fourth part was only sold in 1854. Later the complete land was sold to the Commander Francisco Pinto da Fonseca. Prior to his death in 1865, the Commander divided the land among his sons, Francisco Pinto da Fonseca Teles and Jacinto Bernardino Pinto da Fonseca. The later received the Pau Grande farm. In 1868, Jacinto Bernardino sold the farm to the American James B. Johnson, which subsequently has transferred it to Jo√£o Paulo dos Santos Barreto. Finally, in 1877 the farm was sold to Ant√¥nio Fel√≠cio dos Santos, John Sherrington and Francisco Jos√© Pedro Lessa. These three businessmen constructed there a branch of the Cia. Am√©rica Fabril, a pool of fabric factories that existed in many municipalities in Rio de Janeiro. The factory in Pau Grande, due to its geographical isolation, employed mainly rural workers.

He was known for songs including 'To Be There', 'The Same Old Game', and, perhaps most famously of all, 'On the Back of Daddy-O'. In this last song, he would perform dressed in a creatively devised life-size dummy with a wicker work frame, on whose back he appeared to be sitting. A popular entertainer, Torr appeared at all the major music hall venues around Britain including Wilton's Music Hall in London  Early life  Torr was born in Albion Street, Nottingham, in 1849. He started singing in public early in life under the management of Dick Middleton, of the Atheneum, Nottingham. He was then taken in hand by John Wood, a noted singer and proprietor of the Golden Ball in Coalpit Lane, who ran a 'free-and-easy' attached to his house. At 17, he performed his first engagement away from Nottingham in Leith outside Edinburgh.  Family life  Torr married John Wood's daughter, Elizabeth, with whom he had four children: Annie, Clara, Emma and Sam. Clara Torr (1868 - 1934) would follow in her father's footsteps as a music hall performer as well as being an accomplished pianist in her own right. After Elizabeth died, Torr married for a second time and had a further four children.  Sam Torr and Joseph Merrick - \\"The Elephant Man\\"  After a successful career in the music halls, Torr retired to Leicester, becoming landlord of the Green Man pub in 1882. A year later, he took on the Gladstone Vaults in Wharf Street, converting it into a music hall - the Gaiety Palace of Varieties. Aimed at an upmarket clientele, it opened on 30 April 1883, but after running into financial difficulties, closed three years later. It was during this period as a music hall promoter that Joseph Merrick wrote to Torr asking for employment as an exhibited freak, so he could escape the grinding poverty of life in the workhouse. Torr visited Merrick and agreed to his request, persuading three other managers (Mr J Ellis, George Hitchcock and 'Professor' Sam Roper) to come in with him to form a syndicate and exhibit Merrick initially around the Nottingham and Leicester area. It was Torr and Ellis who suggested that Merrick should present himself as 'the Elephant Man - Half a Man and Half an Elephant'. Torr quickly realized Merrick would need to work with a London-based manager if Merrick was to fully capitalize on his appearance. Torr made contact with Tom Norman, a showman who specialized in showcasing 'human oddities'. Norman took on Merrick, exhibiting him in London at 123 Whitechapel Road.  Later life  After the failure of 'the Gaiety', Torr returned to the music hall, successfully reviving his career with new comic songs as well as old favorites. By 1899, his performances were increasingly out of fashion with London audiences and Torr retired for a second time. Returning to Leicester, in 1904, he injured himself after falling off the stage while intoxicated during a performance of 'On the Back of Daddy-O'. In 1909, Torr became the manager of the Malt Cross in Nottingham. Opened in 1877, the Malt Cross was a well established music hall venue. By the time Torr arrived, the Malt Cross was in decline. Torr took it over, running it with the help of his second family and occasionally performing on the small stage himself. The Malt Cross finally closed for good in 1911 and Torr then moved his family to a house in Shakespeare Street, Nottingham where he lived until his death in 1923.

The company continued to recall more of its cars over the next several months, resulting in nearly 30 million cars recalled worldwide and paid compensation for 124 deaths. The fault had been known to GM for at least a decade prior to the recall being declared. As part of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement, GM agreed to forfeit $900 million to the United States.  Initial and subsequent recalls  The first recall was announced on February 7, 2014, and involved about 800,000 Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5s. On March 31, GM announced it was going to recall over 1.5 million more cars of six different models, due to faulty power steering. Of these, over 1.3 million were in the United States, and three of the models were also involved in the faulty ignition recall. The total number of cars recalled during 2014 as of 1 April was 6.26 million. On May 15, GM recalled 2.7 million more cars, bringing the total number of recalled vehicles in 2014 to 12.8 million worldwide, 11.1 million of which were in the United States. On June 16, 2014, GM announced they were recalling 3.4 million more cars, all of which were produced from 2000 to 2004. They also announced that they intended to replace the cars' keys, because if they did not, the ignition switches could rotate, causing the car's engines to shut off, disabling power steering. On June 30, 2014, GM announced they were going to recall 8.45 million additional cars, almost all of which were being recalled for defective ignition switches. This announcement brought the total number of recalled cars in North America to about 29 million. In November 2014 emails surfaced that showed GM ordered a half-million replacement ignition switches nearly two months before ordering a recall.  Cause of ignition failure  General Motors did not meet two specific requirements ‚Äî torque required and vibration environment ‚Äî for the ignition switch. The torque, or rotational power that prevents the ignition switch from changing modes, was required to be between 10 N¬∑cm and 20 N¬∑cm (Newton centimeters). However, it was less than 10 N¬∑cm, a force so little that made it prone to changes in modes which could potentially shut off the engine. The switch was required to withstand exposure to a vibration environment without damage or loss of function. Yet, it was discovered that during extreme moments of vibrations, or even with the presence of heavy objects on a keychain, the switch would change modes from Run to Accessory without the intent of the driver. The ignition switch was designed to remove power from the vehicle's airbags when in the Off or Accessory mode. Therefore, this was a safety hazard: If the switch changed from Run to Accessory and the vehicle was involved in an accident, it would no longer have power to release the airbags, and it would be difficult for the driver to steer and brake. General Motors was aware of this potential problem, and held meetings about it, as early as 2005.  Quantifying fatalities  The faulty ignition switches have been linked to 124 deaths by GM. Originally, they only linked the failures to 13 deaths and 31 crashes. The company only counted incidents resulting in head-on collisions in which the airbags did not deploy. It did not include, for example, an incident where after a car's ignition switch failed, the car \\"spun out, hydroplaned, hit an oncoming vehicle and rolled off the road, dropping 15 feet into a creek\\". In a collision in which two young women in a Chevrolet Cobalt were killed when the ignition switch shut off the engine, GM only counted the death of the woman in the front seat, because the death of the woman in the back seat was not caused by the failure of the airbag to deploy. Most of the victims were under age 25. On June 3, 2014, Reuters published an analysis concluding that the faulty switches were responsible for 74 deaths, based on Fatality Analysis Reporting System data. General Motors disputed its conclusion, and stood by their original figure of 13 deaths after the report was released as of June 3, 2014. By the end of September, Reuters stated in an article that 153 deaths were linked to the faulty ignition switch. As of March 2015, GM had offered compensation for 11 Category One injuries, along with 115 Category Two injuries./ In April 2015, GM officially noted that the death toll was believed to have reached 87, higher than the previous number of 74 they reported in March 2015. Upon its completion, the compensation fund established by GM had offered compensation for 124 deaths, nearly 10 times more than the 13 deaths GM executives reported in April 2014. However, the true number of deaths resulting from the ignition switch is likely higher, as GM's compensation fund rejected more than 90% of claims and it did not include claims that are part of the ongoing Multidistrict Litigation.  Public disclosure of the problem  The defect was not disclosed by GM nor was it discovered by government regulators or transportation safety agencies. Instead, public knowledge came about because Lance Cooper, a Marietta, Georgia attorney who sued GM on behalf of the family of a woman who had died in a crash, obtained thousands of pages of documents from GM and took the depositions of several GM engineers. According to Sean Kane, the president of a vehicle safety research firm, Cooper \\"single-handedly set the stage for this recall.\\" = Reaction to the recall = The families of the 13 people who died in car crashes involving the recalled vehicles gathered outside the US Capitol prior to Mary Barra's testimony on April 1. They were joined by four Democratic politicians in support of tougher rules regarding the disclosure of automobile defects. At the Capitol, they also said that their relatives had died \\"because they were a cost of doing business GM style.\\" The recall cost GM more than $3 billion in shareholders' value over four weeks. One mother, Laura Christian, created a Facebook page to bring together the family, friends and those who support them.Bunkley, Nick (March 25, 2014) A mother's life mission Auto News  Testimony and lawsuits  = Congressional testimony = Mary Barra's testimony also stated that she does not know why it took nearly a decade to try to initiate a recall, but that she has accelerated efforts to fix the switches, and that she offers \\"my sincere apologies to everyone who has been affected by this recall, especially to the families and friends of those who lost their lives or were injured. I am deeply sorry.\\"The GM Ignition Switch Recall: Why Did It Take So Long?: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, One Hundred Thirteenth Congress, Second Session, April 1, 2014. These remarks were sharply criticized by some of the victims' family members, one of whom dismissed Barra's meeting with them as a mere PR stunt, and by Heidi Moore, who wrote that \\"[Barra] saying sorry to Congress won't cut it\\" and that GM \\"has been good at telling stories that the public wants to hear.\\" Also attending the hearing will be David J. Friedman, the Acting Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), who will be asked why he did not act sooner to recall the cars with the faulty switches, since the NHTSA was aware of the problem before the recall. Friedman's written testimony blames GM for not conveying \\"critical information\\" to regulators which could have led to recalls years earlier. Barra made a number of statements during her testimony which received much media attention. She testified that General Motors would employ Kenneth Feinberg as a consultant to help them decide how to compensate families of those injured by the recalled cars. This decision was praised by Paul M. Barrett, who wrote in Businessweek that \\"...bringing in Feinberg is an excellent first step\\" because he has more than 20 years of experience in mass- injury cases. Barra also said that she asked attorney Anton R. Valukas to help find out why GM took so long to initiate a recall of the defective cars, and that a full account of why this did not happen sooner would have to wait until the results of Valukas's investigation were announced. Another of her widely reported remarks was that she found GM's concern about the cost of replacing the faulty switches \\"disturbing\\" (this was in response to Congresswoman Diana DeGette telling the subcommittee that it would have only cost 57 cents to fix each faulty ignition switch). After being asked by Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill whether a GM engineer had apparently lied under oath, Barra confirmed that this had indeed happened (or at least seemed to). McCaskill later appeared on This Week, where she said of GM that \\"They've tried to lawyer up and play whack-a-mole with these lawsuits, and terrible things have happened,\\" and that \\"Now it's time for them to come clean, be transparent and most of all make victims whole no matter when this deadly ignition caused heartbreak in their families.\\" During the hearings, Barbara Boxer asked Barra why, during the 33 years she worked at GM prior to becoming the CEO in 2013, she never heard anything about the faulty ignition switches. After Barra failed to give a substantive answer, Boxer exclaimed to her that \\"You don't know anything about anything,\\" and that \\"If this is the new GM leadership, it's pretty lacking.\\"Examining the GM Recall and NHTSA's Defect Investigation Process: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Insurance of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, United States Senate, One Hundred Thirteenth Congress, Second Session, April 2, 2014 Also in April 2014, federal safety regulators testified before Congress that they had expected the airbags in the defective cars to be able to deploy for 60 seconds after the engine stalled, but General Motors later told the Associated Press that they actually can only do so for 150 milliseconds.  Reactions to Barra's testimony  In the Wall Street Journal, Holman Jenkins praised the fact that Barra did not argue that the failure to recall the defective vehicles was due to \\"...the problems of a company that no longer exists and a product that's no longer made.\\" However, for the same reason, he also criticized her for suggesting that the company would be more customer-focused with her as the CEO than it was when GM first found out about the faulty switches. = Lawsuits = A large number of lawsuits have been filed in response to the recall, by those claiming to have been injured due to the recalled vehicles' faulty switches. These lawsuits include at least two class action ones, one filed by a man from Myerstown, Pennsylvania on April 2 and another filed in federal court in California. Two other lawsuits have also named Delphi Automotive, the car parts manufacturer who produced the defective switches, as one of the parties partly responsible for the deaths caused by the now-recalled vehicles. On July 29, 2014, a lawsuit was filed in US District Court in Manhattan on behalf of 658 people who claim that they were injured or killed because of the faulty ignition switches in GM's recalled cars. The lawsuit alleges that GM knew about the faulty switches since 2001 but did not recall any of its cars until 2014. The Orange County District Attorney has also filed a lawsuit against GM on behalf of the People of the State of California alleging the company engaged in unfair competition and false advertising in violation of California law when it failed to disclose defects. In April 2016, General Motors reached a confidential settlement with the Pittsburgh-based law firm Pribanic & Pribanic in a wrongful death lawsuit filed on behalf of the family of James E. Yingling III ‚Äì a Pennsylvania man killed in a November 2013 one-vehicle crash. The case was selected as the third in a series of bellwether trials related to the company's extensive recall of defective ignition switches. General Motors won the first two bellwether cases, but days before the Yingling case was expected to go to trial, General Motors offered a settlement that both Mr. Yingling's widow, Nadia, and lead attorney Victor Pribanic found acceptable. = Prosecution deferred and compensation to victims = On September 17, 2015, General Motors entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the United States Department of Justice, in which GM admitted that \\"from in or about the spring of 2012 through in or about February 2014, GM failed to disclose a deadly safety defect to its U.S. regulator ... It also falsely represented to consumers that vehicles containing the defect posed no safety concern.\\" As part of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, GM agreed to forfeit $900 million to the United States. GM gave $600 million in compensation to surviving victims of accidents caused by faulty ignition switches.  Ethical implications  General Motors corporate culture of secrecy encouraged a lack of communication that contributed to the company's unethical actions as they attempted cover up the defective ignition switch scandal. The faulty ignition switch that was part of numerous GM car designs caused the vehicle's mode to change abruptly, shutting off the engine, and preventing the airbags from being released. Numerous consumers were injured and others died when their vehicles were involved in accidents during the last decade. The company experienced serious legal and ethical consequences. General Motors lawyers were aware of the defect since 2005 and failed to communicate this issue to the upper management. This included CEO, Mary Barra, and the board of directors who claim to have learned about the defect in January 2014. By concealing such pertinent information they violated clearly defined ethical obligations under state rules and federal law such as the Sarbanes ‚Äì Oxley Act (SOX). Just like the lawyers, GM engineers were aware of the issue as well. They had received reports about these faulty ignition switches and discussed possible solutions as early as 2005. However, they decided not to fix this issue because it was costly and time consuming. General Motors recall after nearly a decade had a significant impact on the company's reputation. In addition, they expected sales to decline since customers would associate the company with the scandal. The CEO, declared that GM's reputation \\"won't be determined by the recall itself, but how we address the problem\\". The company was determined to honor Barra's promise and, as a result, hired outside attorney Anton Valukas to conduct an internal investigation. The investigation found \\"a pattern of incompetence and neglect at the company, but no cover-up\\". Barra stated she planned to act on all of Valukas recommendations, including firing 15 employees that were determined to have acted inappropriately and disciplining five others. In addition, General Motors launched a compensation program for victims who were harmed by the faulty ignition switches that prompted a recall of more than two and a half million vehicles.  GM's statements on the safety of recalled cars  General Motors has stated that the recalled cars are safe to drive unless the driver has additional items attached to the key ring. However, some consumer advocacy groups have urged GM to declare the cars unsafe for driving no matter what, saying they still pose a danger. In fact, a lawsuit was filed in Texas on April 4, with the plaintiffs aiming to force GM to declare its recalled cars unsafe to drive, but the judge, Nelva Gonzales Ramos, refrained from doing so that day, saying she needed more information.  Aftermath  = Repairs = GM said the parts needed to repair the faulty ignition switches were expected to become available on April 7, 2014. However, that same day, CNN Money contacted six dealerships, none of whom had received these parts. A spokesman for GM, Alan Adler, said that he didn't know how many replacement parts had been shipped to dealerships, or when the majority of parts would be available. = Fines = On April 8, the NHTSA fined GM $28,000, because the company hadn't supplied the agency with the information it had requested it give them by April 3, and the agency charged them $7,000 for each day after then that GM didn't provide this information. On May 16, GM agreed to pay the Department of Transportation the maximum fine of $35 million for delaying the recall of the defective cars they recalled earlier in 2014. = Executive departures = On April 14, 2014, GM announced that two of its executives Selim Bingol, senior vice president for global communications and public policy, and Melissa Howell, senior vice president for global human resources, were departing the company. GM did not say whether Bingol and Howell had resigned or were fired. = Valukas report = On June 5, 2014, Valukas' report on the recall was made public. In it, he asserted that the company's failure to fix the defective switches sooner was not due to a cover-up on the company's part, but rather due to \\"their failure to understand, quite simply, how the car was built.\\" The report led to Barra firing 15 of her employees. = Feinberg plan = On June 30, 2014, Kenneth Feinberg unveiled a plan to compensate victims of recalled GM cars, including an agreement to pay \\"whatever it costs\\" to do so. At a press conference held by the National Press Club, Feinberg added that the compensation fund will accept applications from August 1, 2014 until the end of the year, and that he has the last word as to how much the victims' families should be compensated. In the first week after the fund began accepting applications, 125 claims were filed, 63 involving fatalities. As of September 15, 2014, according to Feinberg's deputy administrator, Camille Biros, 19 deaths are eligible for compensation under Feinberg's plan.

It rises in the hilly woods along the county line dividing Carleton County, Canada from York County, Canada in the western region of the province. Its watershed is adjacent to the South Branch of the Southwest Miramichi River, the Nashwaak River, the Keswick River and the Nackawic Stream.  Features  Three primary branches, the North Branch Becaguimec, the South Branch Becaguimec and the Cold Stream compose the Becaguimec Stream. The Cold Stream originates from springs on the western slope of Skedaddle Ridge and the eastern slope of Garvie Mountain in the community of Knowlesville. The North Branch originates in three tiny lakes only a short distance west of the upper reaches of the Nashwaak River: Malcolm Lake, Long Lake and Owl Lake respectively. The South Branch flows from Becaguimec Lake 13 kilometres southeast of the community of Cloverdale. Where the North and South Branches meet is known as the Becaguimec Forks, lying just northwest of the intersection of Provincial Highway 104 and Provincial Highway 575. After that point the stream is sometimes called the Mainstream, from which the adjacent community derives its name. The stream is slow-paced and meandering between the forks and Mill Brook near Ashland, not infrequently changing course because of floods. The gradient of the stream increases from Mill Brook towards the Saint John River. There are several notable eddies and Class 2 rapids along this stretch, not the least of which is known as Hell's Eddy, 2 miles upstream from the stream's mouth. The Becaguimec enters the Saint John River at the town of Hartland, the site of the world's longest covered bridge.  Fishery  The notable fish species found predominately in the upper reaches of the Becaguimec are brown trout and rainbow trout. The best time of year for fishing trout is from mid-May to mid-June, after the sediment clears from the water after the thaw, but before the summer heat increases the water temperature.  History  The Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet) people named the river for the bountiful salmon pool which lay at the mouth of the stream. The name \\"Becaguimec\\" literally means \\"the place where the salmon lie.\\" The construction of the hydroelectric dam at Mactaquac Dam in 1967 has since decimated the salmon population in the Saint John River. The fertile land at the mouth of the Becaguimec has likely been inhabited for millennia. The hill above the south bank of the stream's mouth (Hagerman's Hill) made an exceptional look-out point from which several miles up the Saint John River can be seen. One of the earliest records of permanent settlement at this site indicates that in 1790 a Wolastoqiyik man by the name of Governor Toma was found \\"tilling his cornfield\\" at the mouth of the Becaguimec. The first European settler to arrive at the mouth of the Becaguimec was Loyalist William Orser in 1797. Several more families soon followed and a community coalesced known as Mouth of 'Guimac. Mouth of 'Guimac was renamed Hartland in 1860. Settlement of the Becaguimec Valley itself began with the establishment of the community of Rockland in 1825 and Coldstream in or about 1826.  River crossings  Three covered bridges once crossed the Becaguimec Stream, though only one remains standing. The Mangrum or Stormdale Bridge (Becaguimec Stream No. 3), which was constructed in 1909, burned in 2011. The Adair Bridge (North Becaguimec No. 1), which was constructed in 1948, burned in 2009. Only the Ellis Bridge (North Becaguimec No. 4) remains. A a concrete road bridge (New Brunswick Highway 105) crosses the stream at Hartland paralleled by a Canadian Pacific Railway trestle (now part of The Great Trail). In 1922, an earlier steel truss bridge, located slightly upstream of the trestle, was destroyed when impounded logs broke free following heavy rains and crashed into the bridge. The trestle was pushed more than a metre out of alignment.  Mills  It is not clear when the first water-driven grist (flour) mill at the mouth of the Becaguimec was established; however it was recorded in the Carleton Sentinel that this mill burned in 1853. A new grist mill and sawmill was then established at some point between the fire and 1872 by Benjamin Jewett. The mill was then leased to Alexander Shaw in 1887 who introduced a steam engine to the operation the following year. Jewett eventually sold the mill to Al Sawyer, a lumber merchant from St. Stephen, under whose direction the mill expanded and began to ship lumber directly to St. Stephen by rail. Sawyer sold the mill in 1905 to Fred E. Sayre. The administration of the mill then passed on to Fred Sayre's son, John Sayre who closed in the mill in 1928, after being reconstructed the previous year due to a 1926 fire.

The extra meal that they purchase is suspended; that is, the restaurant will mark down the sum of money and ‚Äòsuspend‚Äô the additional meal for the poor. Suspended meals today range from a cup of coffee to a meal set. History =Turkey= In Turkey, a tradition going back centuries called askƒ±da ekmek, meaning \\"bread on a hanger‚Äù or ‚Äúsuspended bread\\" involves paying for two bread and taking one while the other is hung for someone else later. =Italy= The term in English originates from a tradition that started in Italy, called pending coffee, or in Italian, caff√® sospeso. Customers would pay for their own coffee and when they wanted to, could pay for an extra ‚Äòsuspended coffee‚Äô or a 'suspended meal' which was meant for the less fortunate. Thus, a person could walk into the cafe and ask if there was a suspended coffee that they could drink. The trend started in cafes of Naples, where people who had experienced good luck or people of middle class would pay for an extra cup of coffee. Then, the poor would come by later and ask if there was any sospeso that could be given for free to them. Such trend has been adopted by other cafes and restaurants that now incorporate the concept of suspended meals. =Hong Kong= Suspended meals in Hong Kong are not as popular as they are in foreign countries. However, they are gradually becoming a trend. It started in a restaurant called Siu Mei Restaurant in Sham Shui Po (ÂåóÊ≤≥ÁáíË†üÈ£ØÂ∫ó). Originally, the boss, Mr. Chan gave out free meals to the poor in Sham Shui Po, an impoverished district. The news of Mr.Chan‚Äôs act soon became publicized and non-governmental Organizations started to cooperate with Mr. Chan to implement the suspended meal scheme. Slowly, more and more food stores, including bakery,dessert, and meal shops in Sham Shui Po adopted the system, too. In 2012, a TV program called ‚ÄúRich Mate Poor Mate Series‚Äù (Á™ÆÂØåÁøÅÂ§ß‰ΩúÊà∞) featured Simon Wong, the owner of LHGroup) and expertise in catering services. He spoke about his organization starting at the grassroots, and how he has strived to strengthen the social responsibility of his chain restaurants by launching schemes of suspended meals. =Taiwan= In Taiwan, several methods have been implemented to make the public more familiar with the concept of suspended meals. For example, there is a Facebook page, ‚ÄúSuspended meal, Taiwan‚Äù, advocating the ideas of suspended meal. The owners of the restaurants can join this page and inform the people that their restaurants are supporting suspended meals. Also, there are photos and descriptions in the page; more details are exposed to the potential consumers of suspended meals like the location of the restaurants and what kind of meals the restaurants are serving. There are also figures indicating the number of meals left in the restaurant. =Dubai= A Pending Meal initiative was started on social media in April 2015 by Sarah Rizvi, focusing on restaurants in Dubai. Once the news of the initiative started to spread, many local restaurants were willing to tie up and provide their support too. The idea spread to other areas including Sharjah, Abu Dhabi, Ras Al Khaimah, U.S.A, Canada, Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan. The Pending Meal movement encourages people to pay for someone else‚Äôs meal at a food outlet so the less fortunate can walk in and eat. There is no limit to how much one can donate to the cause. ‚ÄúThere have been people who have paid in advance for the meal of just one person and some have even paid for 15,‚Äù said Rizvi. The Pending Meal initiative is not a charity organization and does not collect funds (in any form). The initiative is purely encouraging people to give back to community by providing less fortunate with a meal so that no one has to stay hungry. Value The value of this rising trend lies greatly on disseminating the attitude of sharing and giving what we owe to others, so as to bridge the gap between the poor and urban people. However, it must be reminded that the phenomenon should not be viewed as a type of social assistance. In other words, there is no labelling effect in the promotion of the campaign; the focus is not placed on the poor, but rather on the act of citizens suspending meals. This way, individuals can both respect the poor, and promote the natural attitude of helping. Through the collaboration of everyone, the poor can be integrated into the community and feel a sense of belonging. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about communities coming together and looking after people directly in their communities.‚Äù, says John Sweeney, the founder of a page advocating suspended coffee, in an interview with TruthAtlas. Critics =Business Ethics= Despite sharing the same motivation, restaurants and companies have their own operation style in terms of promoting the suspended meal scheme. Because of such difference, some argue that the restaurant owners are trying to make profits by cheating on the scheme rather than helping the needy. Similarly, some people believe that the companies are more likely to cheat on the scheme since they will charge a sum of administrative expenses after holding the fund-raising events like suspended meals. =Effectiveness on Resolving the Poverty Problem= Some people argue that suspended meals cannot effectively ameliorate the poverty problem in Hong Kong in terms of effective implementation. A big proportion of the poor, in fact, denies to take the suspended meal because of their strong dignity. According to a survey conducted by Children Welfare League, 32% of needy children dare not to take free meal because they do not want to disclose personal information and feel shameful. Moreover, people may ask for a free meal although they do not have financial difficulty. In other words, the effectiveness of suspended meals cannot be fully estimated and guaranteed.

It involved the imprisonment and summary execution of unarmed soldiers and officers of the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian). Background The provisional government of Czechoslovakia was proclaimed in Ko≈°ice on 5 April 1945. The Communist Party seized a third of the national government, including the ministers of the Interior and Defence. Revengeful attitudes countenanced by the communists led to massive vigilante justice against former personnel of the German armed forces after the German capitulation. The surrendered German troops included thousands of officers and soldiers of the Estonian Division initially based around Hirschberg im Riesengebirge and Sch√∂nau an der Katzbach. They had been forcefully drafted into the Waffen SS and had received no special training apart from the regular military drill; it is also alleged that they did not commit war crimes. Action The Estonian Division received orders on 7 May to retreat, assemble in Gablonz, move on through Prague in the direction of Pilsen and eventually surrender to the US armed forces. Its headquarters and supply train began to retreat on the same day. Its units began to retreat the day after that. Czech partisans demanded that German units surrendered their arms, which the Estonians did. Subsequently, the partisans chased down and took some of the unarmed men prisoner, tortured and humiliated them. The partisans did not differentiate between the nationals of Estonia who had been illegally conscripted and the German forces. The number of men killed has been estimated as 500‚àí1000, but the actual number is unknown. Soldiers who had been in the custody of Czech partisans were reportedly relieved to be handed over to the Red Army.

Recording and composition \\"Bartender's Blues\\" is Taylor's attempt to stretch into writing country music, which was not the typical genre Taylor wrote in. It was also an attempt to provide a different perspective from the common country music theme of a customer telling his troubles to the bartender. In this song, the bartender gets to narrate his story. The bartender feels trapped and unhappy in his job, and is looking for a \\"honky tonk angel\\" to come save him. Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine described it as \\"James Taylor's impression of what life in a honky tonk must be.\\" Author Aaron A. Fox sees the song as capturing a classic country music metaphor of the bartender who uses his talking skills to \\"repair social ruptures\\" but in the process becomes \\"the very kind of fool he despises, hating his job even as he lights the cigarettes and laughs at the jokes of his customers while watching them fall down on [their] knees.\\" Sue Simmons- McGinity remarks on how the song applies the common country music metaphor of a \\"honky tonk angel\\" who has the potential to save her man but unlike in many country songs, in \\"Bartender's Blues\\" the angel doesn't \\"become wife and mother to be helpful.\\" Linda Ronstadt sings harmony vocals and Dan Dugmore plays pedal steel guitar, while Danny Kortchmar plays guitar.

Four naval vessels would be sold to Taiwan for about $10 million each. Mexico and Thailand would each receive two vessels as a grant. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background The is a class of frigates named after the American Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, the hero of the naval Battle of Lake Erie. The warships were designed in the United States in the mid-1970s as general-purpose escort vessels inexpensive enough to be bought in large quantities to replace World War II-era destroyers and 1960s-era s. Intended to protect amphibious landing forces, supply and replenishment groups, and merchant convoys from submarines, they also later were part of battleship-centric surface action groups and aircraft carrier battle groups/strike groups. pp.42 Fifty-five ships were built in the United States: 51 for the United States Navy and four for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). In addition, eight were built in the Republic of China (Taiwan), six in Spain, and two in Australia for their navies. Former U.S. Navy warships of this class have been sold or donated to the navies of Bahrain, Egypt, Poland, Pakistan, and Turkey. The Taiwan Relations Act (; ) is an act of the United States Congress that has defined the non-diplomatic relations between the United States and the residual Republic of China on Taiwan since the United States diplomatically recognized the People's Republic of China as \\"China\\". The law, passed in 1979, governs U.S.-Taiwan relations and opens up the possibility that the United States may offer Taiwan military assistance if Taiwan is ever attacked by China. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Taiwan Relations Act Affirmation and Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2014 would authorize the President to transfer on a grant basis to Mexico, the Oliver Hazard Perry-class guided missile frigates Curts and McClusky; and (2) to Thailand, the Oliver Hazard Perry-class guided missile frigates Rentz and Vandegrift. Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates underway in 1982 The bill would authorize the President to transfer on a sale basis the Oliver Hazard Perry-class guided missile frigates Taylor, Gary, Carr, and Elrod to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office of the United States (which is the Taiwan instrumentality designated pursuant to the Taiwan Relations Act). The bill would authorize the President, when transferring any vessel named in this Act, to ensure that the total number of vessels transferred to a country named in this Act does not exceed the total number authorized for transfer to that country. The bills would state that: (1) the value of such vessels transferred on a grant basis shall not be counted against the aggregate value of excess defense articles transferred to countries in any fiscal year under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961; (2) transfer costs shall be charged to the recipient; and (3) the country to which a vessel is transferred shall have necessary vessel repair and refurbishment carried out at U.S. shipyards (including U.S. Navy shipyards) to the maximum extent practicable. The bill would terminate transfer authority three years after enactment of this Act. The bill would amend the Arms Control Act to increase congressional notification thresholds for certain foreign military and commercial sales. The bill would declare that: (1) a defense-related license or other approval from the United States Department of State may also authorize the export of items subject to the Export Administration Regulations if such items are to be used in or with defense articles controlled on the United States Munitions List; and (2) separate United States Department of Commerce approval shall not be required, but such items shall remain under Department of Commerce jurisdiction with respect to any subsequent transactions. Congressional Budget office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, As ordered reported by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on November 20, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 3470 would authorize the President to sell four naval vessels to Taiwan. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that those sales would increase offsetting receipts (thus, reducing direct spending) by $40 million over the 2014-2024 period. Because enacting the bill would affect direct spending, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. Enacting the bill would not affect revenues, and implementing it would have insignificant effects on spending subject to appropriation. Section 101 would authorize the sale of naval vessels. That authority would expire three years after the bill is enacted. Based on information from the United States Navy, the CBO estimates that all four vessels would be sold over that period, for about $10 million each. Those funds would be deposited in the Treasury as offsetting receipts. The bill also specifies vessels that may be transferred to certain nations by grant. Under the bill, any additional costs related to authorized sales or transfers, including costs for refurbishing the vessels, would be paid by the recipient countries. Such amounts are typically paid directly to the private shipyard that does the work. H.R. 3470 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. On December 20, 2013, CBO published an estimate for S. 1683, the Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2013, as reported by the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on November 14, 2013. Section 102 of that bill is similar to section 101 of H.R. 3470, and we estimate that both provisions would have the same budgetary effect. Procedural history The Naval Vessel Transfer and Arms Export Control Amendments Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on November 13, 2013 by Rep. Edward R. Royce (R, CA-39). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs. The bill was ordered to be reported by the committee on November 20, 2013 by unanimous consent. The bill's title was changed to the \\"Taiwan Relations Act Affirmation and Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2014\\" on April 7, 2014, when the bill was passed by the House in a voice vote. Debate and discussion Rep. Ed Royce (R-CA) argued in favor of the bill saying that \\"these ships would bolster Taiwan's defense.\\" Royce also said that \\"these transfers help support the priorities of the U.S. Navy while strengthening the capability of allies and our close partners to meet our share maritime security objectives.\\" Taiwanese newspaper The China Post reported that the Taiwanese military expected to receive two of the ships in 2015. The four ships that would be sold to Taiwan under this bill were all commissioned between 1984 and 1985. In addition to purchasing these ships to replace several older 1960s U.S.-built ships that Taiwan got from the U.S. in the 1990s, Taiwan is also thinking about building its own naval vessels.

The genus consists of five species distributed from central Chile to northwestern Argentina.  Taxonomy  The genus was described by John Lindley in 1825. After further examining specimens of Amaryllis ignea (see illustration) that he had described the previous year as Amaryllis, with some reservation, Lindley concluded they were a separate genus, naming two species, P. ignea, and P. cyrtanthoides (previously A. cyrtanthoides). Subsequently, it was considered these were the same plant, and P. ignea was reassigned to a synonym for P. cyrtanthoides. = Phylogeny = Phycella is located in the American (Hippeastroid) clade of the Amaryllidoideaetribe, where it is placed in tribe Hippeastreae, subtribe Traubiinae. In molecular phylogenetic analysis, Phycella forms a sister group to the remainder of the Hippeastreae. In 1996 the M√ºller-Doblies' had situated it in subtribe Hippeastrinae based on morphological criteria, by submerging it in Hippeastrum. A detailed study of in-depth relations within Hippeastreae revealed a more complicated situation wit regard to the Chilean-Argentinian taxa which had not been well represented in earlier studies. There was strong support for two major clades, representing two subtribes, with Phycella and three other genera (but not Hippeastrum) forming the Traubiinae. This study also showed that one species of Famatina (F. maulensis) segregated with Phycella, and was therefore submerged in it as Phycella herbertiana. By contrast the remaining three Famatina species segregated with Rhodophiala and were therefore grouped in Hippeastrinae together with Hippeastrum. Consequently, Famatina has been extinguished as separate genus. = Subdivision = Five species are described: * Phycella australis Ravenna Pl. Life 37: 71 (1981) * Phycella brevituba Herb.

Ume√• Town Hall () was built after the fire in 1888 that burnt the city to the ground. It was erected on the site where the previous town hall (built in the 17th century) had been located and was completed in 1890. The architect was Fredrik Olaus Lindstr√∂m from Stockholm. In the new urban area development plan Lindstr√∂m gave the town hall a prominent location next to the river bank, with the main facade facing south over the harbour on the Ume River (which was still navigable at the time, providing the city's main point of access).  History  = First town hall = During the 17th century, Ume√• only had a few public buildings; the church, the school and the town hall. The town hall was on the north of the R√•dhustorget (the Town Hall Square), and housed the judiciary, the city administration and other common functions. The town hall was a single-storey building, equipped with three windows facing the square and with a high hipped gable roof topped with a roof lantern. = Second town hall = During the Great Northern War the town was completely burned down by the Russians several times, but after the peace in 1721 a new town hall was built at the north end of the Town Hall Square. The new town hall consisted of two floors with two wings and a small tower with a clock and striking clock. In the ground floor the city cellar was located, that is a tavern or restaurant, and a debtor's prison. Upstairs there was a ballroom and a smaller hall for meetings. The west wing had two rooms which served as teaching facilities. = Third town hall = A new and larger town hall with two floors was built in 1814 on the block north of the Town Hall Square with the main facade facing south. The building was designed by Samuel Enander who was an architect at the √ñverintendents√§mbetet (Superintendent Board). In accordance with the Royal Building Regulation which came into force in 1776, public buildings had to be built in stone but Ume√• was granted dispensation and the town hall was instead built of timber. The ground floor included the city cellar, auction rooms, and the remand prison. The upper floor's eastern half had a large hall and room for refreshments, conversation rooms and an atrium. The western half of the upper floor was the session hall of the Magistrate and a common room for city elders. The height of the rooms on the upper floor was higher than the rooms on the ground floor and the building's facade, which had a strict and smooth Empire style, had a richer range upstairs.  New design  Ume√• had an economic boom around the mid-19th century and the public buildings received much needed renovation. The town hall was fitted with white painted panelling and the facade had six Dorian colossal pilasters. In 1880 a telegraph station was moved to the town hall. = Current Town Hall = Fredrik Olaus Lindstr√∂m ‚Äì whom in 1889-90 created the blueprints for Ume√• City Church - was also commissioned to design the new town hall. Lindstr√∂m was inspired by the Dutch Renaissance style, which allowed a certain asymmetry. The many towers were designed with a widely varying height and shape. Otherwise, the fa√ßade is taut and built with red bricks. The portals, the areas surrounding the windows and other details are using light sandstone. For economical reasons some parts, however, use cheaper materials such as cast iron coated with oil paint in matching color. Great emphasis was placed on the surroundings of the town hall beside the river. Among other things a new esplanade from the town hall towards the north was created. A park was built to give the town hall a monumental position. In the garden is a bust to Gustav Ros√©n who was on the town council and rose to be the Governor of the county.Gustav Rosen, Ohlin Institute, retrieved 2 June 2014  Dual main entrances  When the construction of the Main Line Through Upper Norrland reached Ume√• in the middle of 1890 an unexpected problem occurred. It had been decided that the new railway station would be located a bit north of the town hall - i.e. on the back side of the town hall. But it was not considered possible to have the town hall's backside towards the king when he would come by train to inaugurate the railway. Hence, in good time before king Oscar II's arrival in 1896 a second main entrance was built facing north - toward what is now R√•dhustorget (the town hall square) and the town hall had dual main entrances.  The niche on the town hall's western gable  On July 2, 1892 Viktor Rydberg and Georg von Rosen wrote a letter of recommendation to Ume√• City Council for the sculptor Oscar Berg. Berg was interested in creating the statue of goddess of justice, Justitia. the statue was included on the drawings high up on the western gable, above the entrance to the old police station, which is now walled up. Because of the major costs for the city with the reconstruction after the fire in 1888 the city council decided that it could not afford it. A motion in 1895 to allow Helmer Osslund's brother Elis √Öslund to create the statue for 500 Crowns was rejected for the same reason. Hence, the niche of the town hall's western gable today stands empty without a statue.  A multi-purpose building  The town hall housed the assembly room for the City Council and the administrative premises. The western part of the building was initially reserved for the judicial and executive systems; with a police station and arrests on the main floor and the courtroom upstairs. Later the entire western part of the building was used by Ume√• District Court. For several years the ground floor housed a telegraph station and a post office and the basement was occupied by auction rooms.  Gustavus II Adolfs bust  crown prince Gustaf Adolf. A bust of Ume√•'s founder, Gustav II Adolf, is located midway between Storgatan (the Main Street) and the double stairs on the town hall's south side (towards the river). The bust is made of bronze and stands on a granite plinth. The plinth has a medallion with the monogram GARS (Gustavus Adolphus Rex Sueciae). The overall height is about three meters, and the bust was created by the artist Otto Strandman. The statue was unveiled in a festive ceremony on August 20, 1924 in connection with the 300th anniversary of V√§sterbotten Regiment.

It was developed in the early 1980s by researchers at Purdue University and is currently managed by Mark Gibney of the University of North Carolina at Asheville. Introduction Originally, only 59 countries were coded for within the database between 1976 and 1983. In 1984, Mark Gibney took over as manager of the database and expanded the list of countries coded to 180 and the range of years to the most recent years available (currently 2012).The Political Terror Scale uses three sources to code each country: The State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, the Annual Report from Amnesty International and most recently the World Report from Human Rights Watch.The database can be viewed and downloaded from its website. The Coding Process =The Scale= The Political Terror Scale is a five- point fixed scale. # Countries are under a secure rule of law, people are not imprisoned for their views, and torture is rare or exceptional. Political murders are rare # There is a limited amount of imprisonment for nonviolent political activity. However, a few persons are affected; torture and beating are exceptional. Political murder is rare. # There is extensive political imprisonment. Execution or other political murders and brutality may be common. Unlimited detention, with or without trial, for political views is accepted. # The practices of Level 3 are expanded to larger numbers. Murders, disappearances, and torture are part of life. In spite of its generality, on this level terror affects primarily those who interest themselves in politics or ideas. # The terrors of Level 4 have been extended to the whole population. The leaders of these societies place no limits on the means or thoroughness with which they pursue personal or ideological goals. The scale is based on the assessment of violence along three dimensions:scope, intensity, and range. Scope is the type of violence carried out by the state, Intensity refers to the frequency at which the state employs a given type of violence, and Range is the portion of the population targeted for abuse (can also be thought of as the selectivity of violence).Wood and Gibney 2010, p. 373 =The Coders= The principle researchers consist of professors from several universities. * Mark Gibney - Belk Distinguished Professor of Political Science at the University of North Carolina at Asheville. * Linda Cornett - Chair and Professor of Political Science at the University of North Carolina at Asheville. * Reed Wood - Assistant Professor of the School of Politics and Global Studies at Arizona State University. * Peter Haschke - Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of North Carolina at Asheville. * Daniel Arnon - PhD Student at Emory University. Coding is also supplemented by undergraduate and graduate students from several universities. Research assistants for the 2012-2013 year are: Daniel Arnon, Gray Barrett, Minori Hinds, and Kelsey Tavares of the University of North Carolina at Asheville, Alexander Liffiton and Rachel Olson of Arizona State University, Max Scott of the London School of Economics, and Shea Streeter, a recent graduate of the University of Notre Dame. =The Process= The data for each country is analyzed by at least two senior coders and undergraduate assistants. Each nation receives two scores - one from the State Department's report and one from Amnesty International's report. Coders agree with each other regarding a country's score at a rate of roughly 85%. If coders cannot come to an agreement than a third coder will settle the dispute. Due to the contextual nature of the source data, coding is highly subjective, and coders are instructed to ignore their own personal biases or knowledge when determining a country's score. Coders are also instructed to give countries the benefit of any doubt when scoring. If a coder cannot decided between two numbers, they are instructed to use the lower number when scoring. =Challenges and Examples= The Political Terror Scale only measures acts of political terror inflicted by the state. Due to this fact, it may be difficult to score countries when it is not immediately clear which groups are committing acts of violence. Colombia is a perfect example of this dilemma, as although overall violence has decreased since 2000, violence from local militias and paramilitary groups has continued at a relatively stable rate. Although the government has attempted to mitigate the violence, certain actors within the government have either allowed the violence to continue or contributed to it in some way. Therefore, Colombia's score reflects the close level of involvement between government and private actors. Another challenge is that the Political Terror Scale only measures actual violations of physical or integrity rights or acts of violence and therefore countries ruled by truly repressive and coercive regimes may receive low scores. Nations who are successful at oppressing their citizens or who have committed acts of violence in the past to deter resistance generally do not have to commit many acts of violence in order to maintain control. For example, the former USSR would score low on the Political Terror Scale and that score would not reflect the overall level of oppression present in that society.

Cover by Roy De Forest. Nut art was an artistic consciousness movement centered in Northern California that flourished primarily in the late 60s and early 70s. The term \\"Nut art\\" was coined by artist Roy De Forest (in conversation with writer David Zack) to describe an approach to art making which embraced humor along with the phantasmagorical. According to De Forest, Nut artists sought to create fantasy worlds reflective of their own quirks and eccentricities. As such, Nut art placed a high degree of emphasis on evolving visions, of which specific artworks were produced as part of the ongoing process of self- definition, or in service to creating new personas and personal mythologies. (Among these personas was that of Ralph \\"Doggy\\" Dinsmore, a persona used by De Forest.) As with Conceptual art, the idea or underlying concept with Nut art was paramount. As a result, the creation of the Nut artist was not restricted by style or medium, allowing the movement to embrace emerging formats such as performance, text pieces, and appropriation, in addition to more traditional two and three dimensional mediums such as drawing, photography, and sculpture. Because of the emphasis on concept and satire, Nut art welcomed contributions from participants without formal artistic backgrounds as well as those with advanced technical skill and training. Nut art also reflected the importance of process over product, which had been a central tenet of the Action painters a generation previous. Besides De Forest, other key practitioners of Nut art included Robert Arneson, Clayton Bailey (as well as Bailey's alter-ego Dr. Gladstone), Victor Cicansky (alter-ego Victor Ceramski), Robert Cumming, Lowell Darling, Betty G. Bailey, Jack Ford, David Gilhooly, Jerry Gooch, Linda Renner, Peter Saul, Sally Saul, Harold Schlotzhauer, Richard Shaw, Irv Tepper, Chris Unterseher, Peter VandenBerge, Franklin Williams, Maija Zack (alter-ego Maija Woof), and David Zack. David Zack, who was also a poet and art critic, reviewed many of the group's exhibitions. The first major exhibition of Nut art took place in 1972 at the University Art Gallery of California State University, Hayward. The show was co-curated by Clayton Bailey (then art faculty) and Gallery Director Irene Keil. The show produced a catalog which included a preface written by De Forest.

It is proposed that it is possible that a person may develop two separate conscious entities within their one brain after undergoing a corpus callosotomy. The idea first began circulating in the neuroscience community after some split-brain patients exhibited the alien hand syndrome, which led some scientists to believe that there must be two separate consciousnesses within the brain's left and right hemispheres in competition with one another once the corpus callosum is severed. The idea of dual consciousness has caused controversy in the neuroscience community. It has not been conclusively proven or disproven.  Background  During the first half of the 20th Century, some neurosurgeons concluded that the best option of treating severe epilepsy was by severing the patient's corpus callosum. The corpus callosum is the primary communication mechanism between the brain's two cerebral hemispheres. For example, communication across the callosum allows information from both the left and right visual fields to be interpreted by the brain in a way that makes sense to comprehend the person's actual experience (visual inputs from both eyes are interpreted by the brain to make sense of the experience that you are looking at a computer that is directly in front of you). The procedure of surgically removing the corpus callosum is called a corpus callosotomy. Patients who have undergone a corpus callosotomy are colloquially referred to as \\"split-brain patients\\". They are called so because now their brain's left and right hemispheres are no longer connected by the corpus callosum. Split-brain patients have been subjects for numerous psychological experiments that sought to discover what occurs in the brain now that the primary interhemispheric pathways have been disrupted. Notable researchers in the field include Roger Sperry, one of the first to publish ideas involving a dual consciousness, and his famous graduate student, Michael Gazzaniga. Their results found a pattern among patients: severing the entire corpus callosum stops the interhemispheric transfer of perceptual, sensory, motor, and other forms of information. For most cases, corpus callosotomies did not in any way affect patients' real world functioning, however, those psychology experiments have demonstrated some interesting differences between split-brain patients and normal subjects.  Split-brain patients and the corpus callosotomy  The first successful corpus callosotomies on humans were performed in the 1930s. The purpose of the procedure was to alleviate the effects of epilepsy when other forms of treatment (medications) had failed to stop the violent convulsions associated with the disorder. Epileptic seizures occur because of abnormal electrical discharges that spread across areas of the brain. William Van Wagenen proposed the idea of severing the corpus callosum to eliminate transcortical electrical signals across the brain's hemispheres. If this could be achieved, then the seizures should be reduced or even completely eliminated. The general procedure of a corpus callosotomy is as follows. The patient is put under anesthesia. Once the patient is in deep sleep, a craniotomy is performed. This procedure removes a section of the skull, leaving the brain exposed and accessible to the surgeon. The dura mater is pulled back so the deeper areas of the brain, including the corpus callosum, can be seen. Specialized instruments are placed into the brain that allows safe severing of the corpus. Initially, a partial callosotomy is performed, which only severs the front two thirds of the callosum. It is important to note that because the back section of the callosum is preserved, visual information is still sent across both hemispheres. Though the corpus callosum loses a majority of its functioning during a partial callosotomy, it does not completely lose its capabilities. If this operation does not succeed in reducing the seizures, a complete callosotomy is needed to reduce the severity of the seizures. A similar type of procedure, known as a commissurotomy, involves severing a number of interhemispheric tracts (such as the anterior commissure, the hippocampal commissure and the massa intermedia of the thalamus) in addition to the corpus callosum. After surgery, the split-brain patients are often given extensive neuropsychological assessments. An interesting finding among split-brain patients is many of them claim to feel normal after the surgery and do not feel that their brains are \\"split\\". The corpus callosotomy and commissurotomy have been successful in reducing, and in some cases, completely eliminating epileptic seizures. Van Wagenen's theory was correct.  Alien hand syndrome  Alien hand syndrome, sometimes used synonymously with anarchic hand is a neurological disorder in which the afflicted person's hand appears to take on a mind of its own. Alien hand syndrome has been documented in some split brain patients. = Symptoms = The classic sign of Alien Hand Syndrome is that the affected person cannot control one of their hands. For example, if a split- brain patient with Alien Hand Syndrome is asked to pick up a glass with their right hand, as the right hand moves over to the glass, the left hand will interfere with the action, thwarting the right hand's task. The interference from the left hand is completely out of the control of the patient and is not being done ‚Äúon purpose‚Äù. Affected patients at times cannot control the movements of their hands. Another example included patients unbuttoning a shirt with one hand, and the other hand simultaneously re-buttoning the shirt (although some reported feeling normal after their surgery). = Relationship to dual consciousness = When scientists first started observing the alien hand syndrome in split-brain patients, they began to question the nature of consciousness and began to theorize that perhaps when the corpus callosum is cut, consciousness also is split into two separate entities. This development added to the general appeal of split-brain research.  Gazzaniga and LeDoux's experiment  = Procedure and results = In 1978, Michael Gazzaniga and Joseph DeLoux discovered a unique phenomenon among split-brain patients who were asked to perform a simultaneous concept task. The patient was shown 2 pictures: of a house in the winter time and of a chicken's claw. The pictures were positioned so they would exclusively be seen in only one visual field of the brain (the winter house was positioned so it would only be seen in the patient's left visual field (LVF), which corresponds to the brain's right hemisphere, and the chicken's claw was placed so it would only be seen in the patient's right visual field (RVF), which corresponds to the brain's left hemisphere). A series of pictures was placed in front of the patients. Gazzaniga and LeDoux then asked the patient to choose a picture with his right hand and a picture with his left hand. The paradigm was set up so the choices would be obvious for the patients. A snow shovel is used for shoveling the snowy driveway of the winter house and a chicken's head correlates to the chicken's claw. The other pictures do not in any way correlate with the 2 original pictures. In the study, a patient chose the snow shovel with his left hand (corresponding to his brain's right hemisphere) and his right hand chose the chicken's head (corresponding to the brain's left hemisphere). When the patient was asked why he had chosen the pictures he had chosen, the answer he gave was ‚ÄúThe chicken claw goes with the chicken head, and you need a snow shovel to clean out the chicken shed‚Äù. Why would he say this? Wouldn't it be obvious that the shovel goes with the winter house? For people with an intact corpus callosum, yes it is obvious, but not for a split-brain patient. Both the winter house and the shovel are being projected to the patient from his LVF, so his right hemisphere is receiving and processing the information and this input is completely independent from what is going on in the RVF, which involves the chicken's claw and head (the information being processed in the left hemisphere). The human brain's left hemisphere is primarily responsible interpreting the meaning of the sensory input it receives from both fields, however the left hemisphere has no knowledge of the winter house. Because it has no knowledge of the winter house, it must invent a logical reason for why the shovel was chosen. Since the only objects it has to work with are the chicken's claw and head, the left hemisphere interprets the meaning of choosing the shovel as ‚Äúit is an object necessary to help the chicken, which lives in a shed, therefore, the shovel is used to clean the chicken‚Äôs shed‚Äù. Gazzaniga famously coined the term left brain interpreter to explain this phenomenon. = Interpreting Gazzaniga's \\"left brain interpreter\\" = What does the results of Gazzaniga and LeDoux's work suggest about the existence of a dual consciousness? There are varying possibilities. * The left hemisphere dominates all interpretation of the split-brain patient's perceptual field, with the right hemisphere having little importance in these processes. * If so, one could by extension claim there are 2 separate conscious entities that do not interact with each other or are in competition with each other and have separate interpretations of the stimuli, the left hemisphere winning the struggle. * Or perhaps the right hemisphere is unconscious of the snow house and shovel while the left hemisphere retains a conscious perception of its objects.  Other experiments  = Sperry‚ÄìGazzaniga = The Gazzaniga‚ÄìLeDoux studies were based on previous studies done by Sperry and Gazzaniga. Sperry examined split-brain patients. Sperry's experiment included a subject being seated at a table, with a shield blocking the visions from the subject's hands, including the objects on the table and the examiner seated across. The shield was also used as a viewing screen. On the shield, the examiner can select to present the visual material to both hemispheres or to selective hemispheres by means of having the patient look at certain points on the viewing screen. The patient is briefly exposed to the stimuli on the viewing screen. The stimuli shown to the left eye goes to the right hemisphere and the visual material shown to the right eye will be projected to the left hemisphere. During the experiment, when the stimulus was shown to the left side of the screen, the patient indicated he did not see anything. Patients have shown the inability to describe in writing or in speech the stimuli that was shown briefly to the left side. The speaking hemisphere, which in most people is the left hemisphere, would not have awareness of stimulus being shown to the right hemisphere (left visual field), except the left hand was able to point to the correct object. Based on his observations and data, Sperry concluded each hemisphere possessed its own consciousness. = Revonsuo = Revonsuo explains a procedure that was similar in nature to the Sperry‚ÄìGazzaniga design. Split-brain patients are shown a picture with two objects: a flower and a rabbit. The flower is exclusively shown in the right visual field, which is interpreted by the left hemisphere and the rabbit is exclusively shown in the left visual field, which is interpreted by the right hemisphere. The left brain is seeing the flower as the right brain is simultaneously viewing the rabbit. When the patients were asked what they saw, patients said they only saw the flower and did not see the rabbit. The flower is in the right visual field and the left hemisphere can only see the flower. The left hemisphere dominates the interpretation of the stimulus and since it cannot see the rabbit (only being represented in the right hemisphere), patients do not believe they saw a rabbit. They can, however, still point to the rabbit with their left hand. Revonsuo stated that it seemed that one consciousness saw the flower and another consciousness saw the rabbit independently from one another. = Joseph = Rhawn Joseph observed two patients who had both undergone a complete corpus callosotomy. Joseph observed that one of the patient's right hemisphere is able to gather, comprehend, and express information. The right hemisphere was able to direct activity to the patient's left arm and leg. The execution of the left arm and leg's action as was inhibited by the left hemisphere. Joseph found that the patient's left leg would attempt to move forward as if to walk straight but the right leg would either refuse move or begin to walk in the opposite direction. After observing the struggles of the execution of activities involving the left and right arms and legs, led Joseph to believe that the two hemispheres possessed their own consciousness. Joseph also noted that the patient had other specific instances of conflict between the right and left hemispheres including, the left hand (right hemisphere) carrying out actions contrary to the left hemisphere's motives such as the left hand turning off the television immediately after the right hand turned it on. Joseph found that the patient's left leg would only allow the patient to return home when the patient was going for a walk and would reject continuing to go for that walk. = Further observations by Joseph = In the laboratory, a patient was given two different fabrics: a wire screen in his left hand and a piece of sandpaper in his right hand. The patient received two different fabrics out of his view so that neither eye nor hemisphere visually seen what his hands were given. When the patient was indicating what fabric was in the left hand, he was able to correctly indicate and point with the left hand to the wire screen after it had been set on a table. As he pointed with his left hand, however, the right hand tried to stop the left hand and make the left hand point to the fabric that the right hand was holding. The left hand continued to point at the correct fabric, even though the right hand tried to forcefully move the left hand. During the struggle, the patient also verbalized feelings of animosity by saying, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs wrong!‚Äù and ‚ÄúI hate this hand.‚Äù Joseph concluded that the left hemisphere did not understand at all why the left hand (right hemisphere) would point to a different material.  Controversy and alternative explanations  Proponents of the dual consciousness theory have caused a great amount of controversy and debate within the neuroscience community. The magnitude of such a claim: that consciousness can be split into two entities within the one brain are considered by some scientists to be audacious. There is no concrete evidence to validate the theory and the current evidence provided is, at best, anecdotal. The most powerful claims against the dual consciousness theory are: * There is no universally accepted definition of ‚Äúconsciousness‚Äù. * Split- brain patients are not the only people to exhibit the Alien Hand Syndrome. People with intact brains who have suffered a stroke may also have the Alien Hand Syndrome. It also has been observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease or in patients who have brain tumors. * Other existing and established neurological mechanisms can account for an explanation of the same phenomena. Gonzalo Munevar has proposed an alternative explanation to demonstrate that these strange behaviors are spawned from areas in the brain and not by a dual consciousness. Two cortical areas in particular, the supplementary motor area and the premotor cortex, are crucial in the planning of executing motor tasks to external stimuli presented in the person's perceptual field. For example, a person may pick up a glass of water with his right hand and put it up to his lips for a drink. The person may have picked up the glass with his right hand, but well before this action takes place, the PMC and SMA consider a variety of different possibilities of how this action could be performed. He could have picked it up with his left hand, his mouth, even his foot! He could have done it quickly or slowly. Many possibilities are entertained, but few are actually executed. These actions are sent from the PMC to the Motor Cortex for execution. The rest are inhibited by the SMA and are not performed. It is also important to understand that the processes of the SMA and PMC are done unconsciously. The SMA and PMC consider the many alternative actions many milliseconds before the chosen action takes place. The person is never consciously aware of these alternative possibilities the brain has juggled with before he picks it up with the right hand; he just does it. The action of picking up the glass with the right hand is also performed unconsciously. It may be preferable to use his right hand because he is right handed and doing so is therefore more comfortable or perhaps the glass is placed on his right side and the possibility that expends the least amount of energy is using the right hand to pick it up. Another important fact about the PMC is that its activation is bilateral. When it is activated, it is activated in both hemispheres of the brain. Gazzaniga observed and wrote about this phenomenon. When the corpus callosum is severed, many interhemispheric interactions are disrupted. Many areas of the brain become compromised, including the SMA. If the SMA has trouble regulating and inhibiting the actions of the PMC, it is very possible that conflicting sets of actions may be sent to the MC and performed (accounting for both hands reaching for the glass, even if only one hand is intended to grab it). It would make the appearance that there is a dual consciousness competing for dominance over the other for control of the brain, but it is not the case. The fact that the Alien Hand Syndrome eventually goes away in some split-brain patients is not evidence of one consciousness ‚Äúdefeating‚Äù the other and taking complete control of the brain. It is likely that the plasticity of the brain may be the cause for alleviating the disorder. Eventually the split patient's brain may find adaptive routes to compensate for the lost interhemispheric communication, such as alternative pathways involving subcortical structures that perform subcortical interhemispheric inhibition to regain a sense of normalcy between the two hemispheres. Models of multiple consciousnesses Michael Gazzaniga, while working on the model of dual consciousness, came to the conclusion that simple dual consciousness (i.e. right-brain/left-brain model of the mind) is a gross oversimplification and the brain is organized into hundreds maybe even thousands of modular-processing systems. The theory of a division of consciousness was touched upon by Carl Jung in 1935 when he stated, \\"The so- called unity of consciousness is an illusion... we like to think that we are one but we are not.\\" Similar models (which also claim that mind is formed from many little agents, i.e. the brain is made up of a constellation of independent or semi-independent agents) were also described by: * Marvin Minsky's ‚ÄúSociety of Mind‚Äù model claims that mind is built up from the interactions of simple parts called agents, which are themselves mindless. * Thomas R. Blakeslee described the brain model which claims that brain is composed of hundreds of independent centers of thought called ‚Äúmodules‚Äù. * Neurocluster Brain Model describes the brain as a massively parallel computing machine in which huge number of neuroclusters process information independently from each other. The neurocluster which most of the time has the access to actuators (i.e. neurocluster which most of the time acts upon an environment using actuators) is called the main personality. Other neuroclusters which do not have access to actuators or which have only short duration and limited access to actuators are called ‚Äúautonomous neuroclusters‚Äù. * Michio Kaku described the brain model using the analogy of large corporation which is controlled by CEO. * Robert E. Ornstein claimed that the mind is a squadron of simpletons. * Ernest Hilgard described neodissociationist theory which claims that a ‚Äúhidden observer‚Äù is created in the mind while hypnosis is taking place and this ‚Äúhidden observer‚Äù has his own separate consciousness. * George Ivanovich Gurdjieff in year 1915 taught his students that man has no single, big I; man is divided into a multiplicity of small I‚Äôs.

Kirklin (born 1947 in Rochester, Minnesota) is an American cardiac surgeon who has made significant scientific and surgical contributions in the fields of heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support devices to assist the pumping action of the heart. He is Professor of Surgery, former Director of the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2006-2016), Director of the James and John Kirklin Institute for Research in Surgical Outcomes (KIRSO) (2016‚Äìpresent), former Co-Director of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Comprehensive Cardiovascular Center and holds the James Kirklin Chair of Cardiovascular Surgery at UAB. Biography Kirklin is the son of the late heart surgery pioneer John W. Kirklin. He graduated from Ohio State University in 1969, where he was an All-American diver. He received his MD from Harvard Medical School in 1973 as a member of the Alpha Omega Alpha academic honor society. Subsequently, he completed general and cardiothoracic surgery residencies at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1978 where he was Chief Resident, and pursued additional training at Boston Children's Hospital in 1979 and UAB School of Medicine, where he completed his training in 1981. He was appointed Assistant Professor of Surgery at UAB in 1981, Director of Cardiac Transplantation in 1986, Professor of Surgery in 1987, and in 2006 was named Director of the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Kirklin's surgical expertise included surgery for congenital heart disease, heart transplantation, and mechanical circulatory support pumps. In 2012, Kirklin and his colleagues developed the first Children's Hospital pediatric cardiac surgical unit in the state of Alabama. In 2017, at the age of 70, he retired from clinical surgery to direct the Kirklin Institute for Research in surgical outcomes. Scientific work Kirklin and his colleagues at UAB pioneered the development of multi-institutional collaborative outcomes research in pediatric and adult heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support. In 2007, he was the first surgeon to bridge an infant with failing single ventricular heart to successful heart transplantation, with a longer term pediatric heart assist device called the Berlin Heart ventricular assist device. In 2011, he was the first surgeon in North America to implant the HVAD continuous flow ventricular assist device in a child. This nine-year-old girl was supported for 60 days and she then underwent successful cardiac transplantation. In 2014, Kirklin was the first surgeon in North America to implant the Eva Heart continuous flow ventricular assist device. In 2015, Kirklin led the surgical team that implanted the Berlin Heart on the youngest baby (17 days old) to receive extended (greater than 1 month) mechanical circulatory support (136 days) before undergoing successful heart transplantation. Kirklin and his colleagues at UAB established the Cardiac Transplant Research Database in 1990, which generated the first multi- institutional collaborative research in heart transplantation, producing numerous seminal publications over a 20-year span. In 1993, Kirklin and his UAB research group initiated the Pediatric Heart Transplant Study Group, which became the Pediatric Heart Transplant Society (PHTS), and continues to lead the field in multi-instuitional studies. In 2013, Kirklin was honored as a Founding Father of the PHTS. Kirklin's research group developed an international database platform for mechanical circulatory support (IMACS) within the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) in 2012, and created and direct a global database for the World Society for Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery (WSPCHS) since 2017. Kirklin was Principal Investigator of the $15 million NIH-funded national Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) from 2006-2017. Kirklin is Past President of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (2009-2010) and President Elect (2022) of the World Society for Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery. In April 2016, UAB established the James and John Kirklin Institute for Research in Surgical Outcomes. Kirklin was first author of the textbook of Heart Transplantation in 2002, co-authored the fourth edition of the textbook of heart surgery Cardiac Surgery in 2013, and co-edited the book Mechanical Circulatory Support: A Companion to Braunwald's Heart Disease, 2nd Edition in 2019. He served as Editor of the Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation from 2000‚Äì2009, and he is principal editor of the ISHLT Monograph Series. In 2014 Kirklin was the first recipient of the ISHLT Distinguished Educator Award. He has authored over 500 scientific publications. In 2019 Kirklin was selected to receive the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Lifetime Achievement Award.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background The Glacier Bay National Park Resources Management Act of 2000 () ordered the Department of the Interior to study this situation to decide if the Huna Tlingit could begin egg collection again \\"without impairing the biological sustainability of the gull population in the park.\\" Their recommendations were completed and announced in August 2010. The Huna Tlingit had been prohibited by the federal government from collecting the eggs for nearly 50 years. The collection of the eggs is part of a long cultural heritage. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Huna Tlingit Traditional Gull Egg Use Act would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to allow members of the Hoonah Indian Association to collect the eggs of glaucous-winged gulls up to two times a year at up to five locations within Alaska's Glacier Bay National Park. The bill would consider the collection of those eggs within the Park by the Association to be a use specifically permitted by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. The bill would require collection schedules and locations to be based on an annual plan prepared by the Secretary and the Association. Congressional Budget office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on February 27, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 3110 would authorize the Hoonah Indian Association to harvest glaucous-winged gull eggs from Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska. Under the legislation, the Association would be permitted to harvest eggs not more than twice a year from up to five locations within the park. The bill would also direct the United States Department of the Interior to develop an annual harvest plan with the Association. Based on information provided by the United States National Park Service, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 3110 would have no significant impact on the federal budget. Enacting H.R. 3110 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you- go procedures do not apply. H.R. 3110 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. On May 29, 2013, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for S. 156, the Huna Tlingit Traditional Gull Egg Use Act, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on May 16, 2013. The two bills are similar, and the CBO cost estimates are the same. Procedural history The Huna Tlingit Traditional Gull Egg Use Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on September 17, 2013 by Rep. Don Young (R, AK-0). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources, the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indian and Alaska Native Affairs, and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation. The bill was reported (amended) by the committee on April 1, 2014 alongside House Report 113-393. On April 28, 2014, the bill passed the House in a voice vote. The bill then passed the Senate by unanimous consent on July 9, 2014. President Barack Obama signed it into law on July 25, 2014. Debate and discussion Herbert Frost, the Associate Director of National Resource Stewardship and Science for the National Park Service, testified before the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indian and Alaska Native Affairs on February 5, 2014. Frost said that the Department of the Interior was in favor of the bill because it \\"provides for the restoration of an important cultural connection to Glacier Bay by the Huna Tlingit, and provides for the environmentally preferred action identified in our studies.\\" Rep. Don Young (R-AK) said that \\"passage of this legislation is an important step for upholding the traditional way of life for Alaska's First People.\\" Young also said that \\"it‚Äôs a shame that even after Congress amended the Migratory Bird Act in 1995 to allow for customary and traditional use of migratory birds by indigenous inhabitants of Alaska, gull egg harvests remained prohibited under National Park Service regulation.\\" Robert Starbard, the Hoonah Indian Association's Tribal Administrator, said that \\"eggs are a healthy springtime food and egg harvesting activities provide opportunities for family bonding, inter-generational learning, and connection to homeland.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 3110 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 3110 *GovTrack.us H.R. 3110 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 3110 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 3110 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 3110 *House Report 113-393 on H.R. 3110.

His photographs range on subjects and formats from realist portraits to tribal elders, from abstract cityscapes to electronic manipulations of tribal environments. His images are considered personally meaningful as they are representative of tribal realities and highlight the sensitivity behind the representation of Native Americans. Early life and education Larry McNeil was born in Juneau, Alaska on May 12, 1955 into the Killer Whale House, Keet Hit, of the Northern Tlingit and was raised in both Juneau and Anchorage, Alaska. This made him a member of both the Tlingit and Nisga'a tribes. He received his education from Brooks Institute School of Photographic Art and Science in Santa Barbara, California. Career Larry McNeil describes himself as a product of both the traditional Tlingit culture and mainstream North America, with an emphasis on the Tlingit aspect.http://www.andrewsmithgallery.com/exhibitions/larrymcneil/larrymcneil.html In 1983, he worked with Alaska Native Foundation and produced Yupik Eskimo women weaving distinctive grass baskets. Later in 1986, he created seventeen portraits of tribal clan leaders in Northwest Arctic School District. In the same year, he was nominated as vice-president of the Native Indian/Inuit Photographers Association; he was also an instructor at the Institute of American Indian Arts as well as a commercial photographer. McNeil is currently an associate professor of photography at Boise State University. =Works= McNeil's sequence of photographs titled Fly By Night Mythology was well received. Emeritus Professor of American Literature, Mick Gidley, commented that the sequence \\"represents both recovery of history and, photographically, creation through revision\\" in a manner that \\"frames in photographs - both old and new - a national myth that incorporates the first Americans\\". The sequence features a series of archive photos from McNeil's family history of growing up in Anglo-American culture juxtaposed with images of his Tlingit tribe members, as a representation of his own mixed ancestry and of the relationship between the two histories. The early photographs in the work are also a symbolic representation of traditional Tlingit stories, featuring examples of \\"Raven the Changeling and Trickster playing the protagonist\\", along with representations of interactions between Chief Pontiac and George Washington.

First World War Fighting in the Battle of Tirlemont (Hautem-Sainte-Marguerite), von Quast was promoted to General der Infanterie on 19 August 1914. In 1916 he participated in the Battle of the Somme where he and his corps were positioned in the southern sector near P√©ronne. His stern defensive and his organizatorial skills were noticed and he received the Pour le Merite from the hand of Emperor Wilhelm II on 11 August. In January 1917 Quast was assigned to lead the prestigious Guards Corps, a command he held until September when he was named commander of the 6th Army. On 10 April 1918 he was awarded the oak leaves to his Pour le Merite. After the war After the fighting ended and the demobilisation of the high command von Quast relinquished his command and put in the leadership reserve. On 18 January 1919 he was assigned command of Grenzschutz-Armeeoberkommando Nord (literally Border Protection ‚Äì Army High Command North) as part of the Provisional Reichswehr at K√∂nigsberg.

Not until the 1860s were they investigated more carefully. √Ölesund-based Peter Brandal bought the claims in 1916 and established the company Kings Bay. The town, originally known as Brandal City and Kings Bay, was founded that summer when coal mining commenced. The first research installation, a geophysical station at Kvadehuken, was established in 1920. The mining was soon unprofitable and was kept running through state subsidies. In the mid-1920s the town was used for a series of airship expeditions towards the North Pole. Mining operations shut down in 1929 and Kings Bay was nationalized. The town was maintained during the 1930s, when saw the installation of a fisheries station and the establishment of a tourist hotel. The town was resettled with miners on 7 May 1940, just to experience an evacuation in August 1941. Miners returned on 13 August 1945 and the town was gradually expanded, including construction of a school, and new mines were opened. During the late 1950s Norsk Polar Navigasjon attempted to build an airport, but never received permission. Ny- √Ölesund experienced a series of mining accidents, with the ones in 1948, 1951 and 1952 each killing more than ten men. Safety measures were enforced, causing mines to be closed for upgrades and production remaining low. The final accident occurred on 5 November 1962, killing twenty-one miners. The succeeding Kings Bay Affair caused Kings Bay to terminate all mining operations from 5 November and forced Gerhardsen's Third Cabinet to resign. Kings Bay retained the company town and gradually transformed it into a research community. Kongsfjord Telemetry Station and Ny-√Ölesund Airport, Hamnerabben commenced operations in 1967, and the following year the Norwegian Polar Institute established itself in Ny-√Ölesund. Starting in the 1970s the town experienced a gradual growth in research and tourism, with the Norwegian Institute for Air Research an early agent. Cultural heritage became an area of focus from the 1980s and from 1992 the authorities permitted foreign research institutions to establish permanent stations in town. Establishment hips anchored in the bay, with one of the locomotives The coal deposits at Kongsfjorden were first discovered by Jonas Poole during a whaling expedition in the area in 1610. They did not receive more careful analysis until 1861, when Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand on Otto Torell's expedition carried out surveys. Additional samples were collected by a Swedish expedition in 1870. A/S Bergen‚ÄìSpitsbergen Kulgrubekompani was founded in 1901 and, led by Skipper Bernhard Pedersen, laid claims at both Kings Bay and Adventfjorden. The claims at Kings Bay were never properly followed up as the company instead chose to focus on its other find. Ernest Mansfield claimed to have made claims to coal fields on the south side of Kongsfjorden in 1905 and 1906, which were sold to The Northern Exploration Co. Ltd. in 1910. During a scientific expedition in 1909 and 1910, later professor Olaf Holterdahl conducted geological sampling. In the ensuing five years, Green Harbour Coal Co. sent expeditions from Green Harbour. This included the construction of a test shaft.Hanoa: 9 A hut was built in 1912 by the expedition on MK Ons√∏.Hanoa: 10 Green Harbour's owner, Christian Anker, died in 1912. The estate unsuccessfully attempted to sell the claim for four years. In the end it proposed that √Ölesund Municipality buy the rights. At this point √Ölesund shipper Peter Brandal was desperately looking for a source of coal, as he had been black-listed by the United Kingdom. The rights cost 250,000 Norwegian krone (NOK). Brandal dispatched two ships and sixty men to Kings Bay for the summer of 1916. They arrived on 21 July and immediately started breaking surface coal and in the shaft. In the latter alone the first expedition succeeded at collecting 300 tonnes. Brandal formally transferred the ownership of the claims to the newly established company Kings Bay Kull Comp. A/S on 14 December 1916. In addition to Brandal, it was owned by M. Knutsen, Trygve Klausen and Tryge Jervell and the company received a share capital of NOK 500,000. The company set up its offices in Kristiania (Oslo),Hanoa: 12 although they moved to √Ölesund within a year.Hanoa: 16 Loading equipment in the early years Jens K. Bay was hired as the first managing director.Hanoa: 14 Thirty people were sent by SS Carl to Kings Bay for the 1917 season. Planning of the mining community started, first with the site of the town. SS Deneb arrived with 100 men and supplies such as railway tracks and two locomotives on 26 August. By winter thirteen buildings had been erected and of railway laid. The company was not permitted to erect a radio telegraphy station.Hanoa: 15 This caused communications to have to be sent by skiers by land to Longyearbyen, which resulted in an amputation in February 1918. The company therefore pressed for permission to establish a telegraphy station. A post office opened in 1918.Hanoa: 147 Sixty-four people stayed the winter of 1917‚Äì18, with mining being carried out in the Agnes Mine. They were supplemented from May 1918, bringing the summer population to 300. Jervell sold his shares to the other owners on 2 April. The 1918 season saw twenty shipments and the arrival of a third locomotive. Nine additional buildings were constructed,Hanoa: 18 and the Advokaten Mine was opened.Hanoa: 23 The winter of 1918‚Äì19 saw 143 people stay the winter, rising to 250 the following summer. During the first years several names were in use for the settlement, including Kings Bay, Kingsbay and Brandal City. Ny-√Ölesund came into use in the early 1920s and was soon the official name of the settlement.Hanoa: 19 First mining period The 1918 crew The mining was hit by two strikes in 1919, the first lasting from the summer to October, and the second from November to January 1920. Shipping took place from May through October, with 35,000 tonnes being shipped out in 1920.Hanoa: 21 The company hired Trygve Klausen as managing director and built a quay and a shed in Harstad. By 1919 the company had fallen into severe financial difficulties. A British consortium offered to buy the mine. The issue was brought to the Ministry of Trade and Industry, who presented the issue for Parliament.Hanoa: 22 The importance of keeping a Norwegian mining operation was articulated both in lieu of keeping a Norwegian presence on archipelago, which would soon fall under Norwegian sovereignty, but also in the need for keeping Norwegian jobs. A deal was struck whereby the ministry bought 30,000 tonnes of coal for NOK 6 million, while the owners were obliged to not sell the company without state permission. By 1921 the number of women living in Ny-√Ölesund grew to twenty- two and there were twenty-three children who spent the winter. Falling coal prices in 1921 saw the company receive further subsidies from the state. Throughout the 1920s the population varied from year to year. The peak summer population hit 319 men, 29 women and 8 children in 1923, and a low 188 employees in 1929. The winter population varied between 276 in 1926‚Äì27 and a low 158 in 1928‚Äì29.Hanoa: 27 From the 1920s and onwards there was a limited amount of tourist traffic visiting Ny-√Ölesund.Hanoa: 69 The town in the late 1910s The Geophysical Institute of Troms√∏ established a geophysical station at Kvadehuken in 1920, consisting of a small hut and a radio mast allowing communication via Ny-√Ölesund. It carried out meteorological surveys and geomagnetic field measurements and was manned by four men.Hanoa: 44 Two of these died in February 1922 while attempting to rescue a trapper. The station was closed in 1924 due to lack of funding.Hanoa: 45 The Church of Norway never established a presence in Ny-√Ölesund, although the minister at Svalbard Church in Longyearbyen visited Ny-√Ölesund irregularly.Hanoa: 121 Most of the children in town were below school age. However, during the 1920‚Äì21 winter there were 23 children in town and an improvised school was taken into use for the year.Hanoa: 125 The Ministry of Trade and Industry carried out geological surveys in 1922 and renewed the purchase agreement. Production hit 91,000 tonnes in 1923, and then stabilized for the rest of the 1920s, at between 89,000 and 99,000 tonnes per year. Production moved to the Olsen Mine and the Sofie Mine in 1924.Hanoa: 28 Kings Bay attempted coal liquefaction from 1924 to 1927 in cooperation with Greaker Cellulosefabrik. Four hundred tonnes of oil were produced, but the endeavor failed to become profitable.Hanoa: 38 The labor union, Kings Bay Arbeiderforening, was founded in 1925, although many of the workers had previously ad hoc organized themselves.Hanoa: 134 Northern Exploration Company had conducted trial operations with mining on Blomstrandhalv√∏ya, a headland across Kongsfjorden from Ny-√Ölesund, in 1906.Hanoa: 31 The British company set forth claims to the southern part of the bay in 1919, arguing that they had conducted a valid occupation of that area as well.Hanoa: 32 An agreement was struck between the British company and the Government of Norway on 26 October 1925, whereby two-thirds of the land in question was waived and variously given to Kings Bay, Kulspids, Stavanger Spitsbergen and the government for ¬£37,000. The remaining areas were bought by the state in 1932. Falling coal prices led to a production halt during the winter of 1925‚Äì26, in which only 17 men stayed the winter.Hanoa: 30 Ordinary operations resumed in 1926, with production commencing in the Ester Mine.Hanoa: 33 Norge in Ny-√Ölesund on 7 May 1926 Between 1925 and 1928, four attempts were made to reach the North Pole by air from Ny-√Ölesund. In May 1925, Roald Amundsen used Ny-√Ölesund as a base for two flying boats, but the expedition failed to come closer than 88 degrees north.Hisdal: 102 On 9 May 1926,Hanoa: 47 Floyd Bennett and Richard E. Byrd used Ny-√Ölesund as both the starting and landing for their expedition. Although they claimed to have reached the pole, there is strong evidence that they could not have accomplished this.Hisdal: 103 On 11 May, Amundsen and Umberto Nobile's airship Norge left Ny-√Ölesund and traveled via the North Pole to Alaska. This is regarded as the first successful expedition to the North Pole. After two short skirmishes, Nobile's airship Italia left Ny-√Ölesund on 23 May 1928 to reach the North Pole, but crashed on the return.Hisdal: 49 The flying boats did not require any specific infrastructure, although they had to be brought by ship to Ny-√Ölesund, where they were assembled. They took off from a manually groomed air strip on snow.Hanoa: 46 For the airship expeditions, a hangar and a mast were needed, completed on 15 February 1926. The first fatal mining accident took place in the Ester Mine on 16 December 1926, killing two miners. Four men were killed on 20 April 1927 when a section of a shaft in the same mine collapsed after a gas explosion.Hanoa: 34 An accident on 16 August 1929 killed to miners,Hanoa: 39 and from that season the ministry decided to terminate the subsidies and halt production due to the company's lack of profitability.Hanoa: 40 The company hired three to four men to stay in the town each winter, including a telegraphist.Hanoa: 61 Nationalization Miners in the Agnes Mine As of 1 January 1929 Kings Bay owed NOK 6.2 million plus interest of NOK 3.6 million to the government and NOK 8.8 million to Aalesunds Kreditbank. The government paid the bank NOK 125,000 for its claims on 24 February 1931, becoming the sole creditor. The owners agreed to transfer their ownership to the state on 4 November 1931, which took effect on 23 December 1933. Ny-√Ölesund was kept in a state of readiness to resume production. Kings Bay negotiated purchasing Nya Svenska Stenkolaktiebolaget Spetsbergen's mine at Svea, which had been dormant since a 1925. This was not carried out and instead the mine was sold to Store Norske.Hanoa: 63 With reports in 1934 of large quantities of cod off the western coast of Spitsbergen, a proposal was made to establish a fisheries station at Ny- √Ölesund. The Ministry of Trade and Industry supported the proposal and granted NOK 20,000 for the establishment, which was contracted to Kings Bay. Five men were dispatched in 1935 and they started repairs of the town, including fetching materials and buildings from Ny-London, located across the bay. Among the main tasks of the station was steaming of cod liver oil and salting of the cod, in addition to providing supplies. The station was popular amongst the fishermen, but went with a deficit of NOK 15,500 the first year. A NOK 50,000 grant was issued the following year and fourteen men were stationed at Ny- √Ölesund.Hanoa: 65 The Directorate of Fisheries recommended that the arrangement continue, but the ministry was not willing to continue the funding and the station closed ahead of the 1937 season.Hanoa: 66 It was taken over by Jacob Kj√∏de, who also operated a station at Gr√∏nfjorden, and retained operation for three seasons.Hanoa: 67 The North Pole Hotel At the same time, Adolf Hoel encouraged the establishment of a hotel. Laura Borgen signed an agreement with Kings Bay and started the North Pole Hotel in one of the former housing units. During 1936 six cruise ships with 4,000 passengers visited the town. Kj√∏de took over ownership of the hotel from 1937. A/S Nordpolhotellet was incorporated on 22 June 1938 and used four buildings for its hotel operations. The upgraded hotel opened on 3 September 1939, but was closed only days later following the news of the German invasion of Poland. Kings Bay moved its head office from √Ölesund to Oslo on 22 June 1939.Hanoa: 70 The break-out of the Second World War resulted in the need for increased coal production in Norway, and the Ministry of Trade and Industry appointed committee to consider production increases. Its conclusions were announced on 5 April, where it was recommended that production resume in Ny-√Ölesund. Kings Bay aimed at starting production from the summer of 1941, as the war made earlier production start difficult.Hanoa: 72 The town was re-settled on 7 May 1941 and work started in the Ester II Mine. However, production would not last long. The Allied commanders determined that they would not prioritize to protect Svalbard and determined in August that they would evacuate the island. A fleet arrived on 25 AugustHanoa: 73 and evacuated the population on 29 August. Critical infrastructure, such as the power station and the railways, were blown up.Hanoa: 74 From January 1942 Kings Bay had two boards, one in Oslo and one in London. This was an arrangement which lasted until the end of the war in 1945.Hanoa: 75 The London board worked on various plans to resume production, but none of these materialized. Instead, the Oslo board worked on long-term plans to modernize the mining operations, perhaps with the ability to commence operations after the war ended.Hanoa: 76 Allied intelligence conducted a few investigations of Ny-√Ölesund during the war, including both aerial observations, and discovered that German troops must have searched the site. Second mining period The former coal-fired power station Kings Bay dispatched a crew after the war ended, with the first 90 workers arriving at Ny-√Ölesund on 13 August 1945. Five new buildings were built and the Ester II Mine had to be cleared, so production did not resume until November. The power station was not operational until the following spring. Ove Roll Lund was hired as manager from 1946, but he was shot and killed by an insane employee on 25 August. Around the same time mining started in Ester III.Hanoa: 78 The towns population was between 140 and 170.Hanoa: 79 Production reached 61,000 tonnes in 1947.Hanoa: 80 The following year a new separation plant was built and the power station burned down, having to be rebuilt.Hanoa: 81 There were three fatal accidents the first three years of operation, each killing one miner.Hanoa: 140 Then on 4 December 1948 an explosion took place in Ester III, killing fifteen men. Production halted until 14 February 1949 while the accident was investigated.Hanoa: 82 From 1946, the Royal Norwegian Air Force started serving Ny-√Ölesund with their Consolidated PBY Catalina amphibian aircraft. The aircraft were able to land if there was no ice on the fjord and lighting and weather permitted it. The first flight took place on 10 May and consisted of post drops. No further flights were carried out until 1949; one of the flights that year was an air ambulance operation.Hanoa: 159 Weather observations were carried out in 1950 to 1953, and again after 1961.Hanoa: 149 The building for Ny-√Ölesund Radio Kings Bay issued its own private currency between 1947 and 1964. It only issued bills and the money's validity was limited to Svalbard. A women's group, Polarklokken, was founded in 1949. A cinema was built in the community center with shows in the weekend. There was a dance once a month in the same site.Hanoa: 119 Other cultural activities included a marching band and a sports club.Hanoa: 120 A school was established in 1950, as there were five children of school age, which remained in operation until 1963. This caused an increase in the number of children living in town, with between 14 and 18 pupils attending the school after 1958.Hanoa: 127 The mine flooded on 26 April 1949 and it took half a year to empty it. Production that year ended at 40,000 tonnes.Hanoa: 83 A series of upgrades were carried out, bringing production up to 80,000 tonnes in 1951.Hanoa: 84 On 7 January 1951 there was an explosion in the Ester V Mine, killing nine men.Hanoa: 85 The same day a mining explosion in Longyearbyen killed six people, and a common investigation was carried out by a government committee. A year later, on 19 March 1952, yet another explosion took place in the Ester Mine, this time killing nineteen men.Hanoa: 86 The miners sent a letter to the Minister of Justice stating that they would not work until the safety measures proposed by the previous two commissions were carried out. A new commission was dispatched to Ny-√Ölesund, which found that some of the safety measured had been carried out, and some had not. It recommended that new safety measures be implemented. In the meantime mining was placed on hold.Hanoa: 87 Pipelines and cables are located in wooden boxes to avoid permafrost Parliament granted NOK 1.2 million to upgrade the mines, with the company having an operating deficit of NOK 2.9 million that year. A further grant of NOK 1.9 million was issued the following year. The population dropped to 72 while production was halted. In 1954 there was produced 5,000 tonnes of coal, mostly for the towns own consumption.Hanoa: 91 By 1955 the estimates for continuing operation, mostly prominently the need for improved ventilation systems, reached an estimate of NOK 20 million.Hanoa: 96 A certain amount of production was resumed, reaching 15,000 tonnes in 1955.Hanoa: 97 Parliament approved a new production plan on 20 March 1956, which set a production goal of 200,000 tonnes of coal annually. The company built a new power station, bath and a fire station, as well as additional housing. Ester I was re-opened and upgraded.Hanoa: 98 Production gradually increased to 47,000 in 1958, before falling again, in part because of falling coal prices.Hanoa: 102 In 1956 two brothers, Einar Sverre and Gunnar Sverre Pedersen proposed that an airport be built at Kvadehussletta, on the outer-most point of Br√∏ggerhalv√∏ya. Through their company Norsk Polar Navigasjon they initially planned for a long runway, which could easily be expanded to . Kings Bay stated that they were open for negotiations.Tamnes: 15 Funding was in part secured through the United States Armed Forces and the plans called for both the establishment of a hotel and for emergency landings of aircraft.Tamnes: 20 The project was met by protests from the Soviet Union, who claimed the airport would violate the demilitarization clauses of the Svalbard Treaty.Tamnes: 18 The issue resulted in a prolonged political debate with the Pedersens attempting to gain building permission and the Norwegian and Soviet governments attempting to hinder the construction.Tamnes: 23 The issue gradually lost momentum, but the brothers did not stop working for the airport until 1965.Tamnes: 45 Remains of mining A series of cultural investments were carried out in 1958: the newspaper Det nye Kingsbay was published, a public library was established and the school moved to a new building.Hanoa: 105 By 1959 Ester I was depleted and the railway was closed‚Äîtransport having been taken over by trucks. That year only 8,000 tonnes were exported.Hanoa: 104 A new shaft was opened the following year, allowing mining to start in Vestre Senterfelt. Production in 1960 hit a record 79,000 tonnes of raw coal, which after being processed through the new coal preparation plant resulted in 51,000 tonnes. Start of a coke plant in Mo i Rana helped stimulate the domestic coal demand. Washed coal production hit 54,000 tonnes in 1961.Hanoa: 106 By then NOK 21 million had been invested in the past years, although the coal prices had continued to fall, and especially in Norway the demand had diminished. Norway was retiring its last steam locomotives, but unlike in most of Europe it was not replicating the coal demand through construction of coal-fueled thermal power plants.Hanoa: 107 By 1962 Ny-√Ölesund had 25 family apartments and barracks for 210 male employees. Production hit 75,000 tonnes of washed coal in 1962.Hanoa: 108 Kings Bay Affair On 5 November 1962 the √òstre Senterfelt Mine experienced an explosion, which killed 21 of the 25 men which were on the shift.Hanoa: 164 The rescue operation provided difficult, and by 9 November only ten of the men had been found. The Ministry of Industry appointed a commission, led by Finn Midb√∏e, to investigate the accident. The arrived on 9 November and departed on the 16 November with the last coal ship to avoid being frozen stuck at Ny- √Ölesund for the winter. Thus it never had an opportunity to enter the mine.Hanoa: 167 The fire continued, while the lower levels were flooded. Permission to drain the shafts were never given, and the deceased were never brought up.Hanoa: 173 Production continued in the new Vestre Senterfelt, while √òstre Senterfelt remained closed,Hanoa: 169 with 102 employees staying the winter.Hanoa: 172 Ny-√Ölesund has since its foundation seen regular visits by tourist ships The government appointed a new commission, led by Per T√∏nseth, on 4 January. They were hindered from arriving at Ny-√Ölesund until 15 May 1963, where it stayed for ten days. In its 27 May report it concluded that the accident had been caused by an explosion of methane which had again ignited coal dust. It criticized both Kings Bay for not following safety regulations and the Commissioner of Mining for not carrying out the necessary inspections. Kings Bay's board rejected the conclusions in the report, arguing that there had not been a coal dust explosion. The accident became a major issue of debate in the press. The debate had ensued for half a year by the time the T√∏nseth report was published, and the mining company's on-site director, lacking regular postal service and thus ready access to newspapers, was not able to accurately correct any errors in the press. The publication of the report and the delay until the company could respond caused Parliament to delay its summer leave past 20 June 1963. That day Kjell Holler resigned as Minister of Industry and was replaced by Trygve Lie. The issue was debated in Parliament from 20 to 23 August, where the opposition criticized the government for a series of management errors, such as not ensuring that the Labor Inspection Authority had sufficient mining competence. Following the 1961 election the Labor Party lost its Parliamentary majority for the first time since 1945. Gerhardsen's Third Cabinet was held in place by two pivoting seats held by the Socialist People's Party (SF). They and the center-right opposition voted in mis-confidence, forcing Einar Gerhardsen to resign. Parliament also voted to close the mining operations and issued NOK 22 million to pay Kings Bay's debt. Mining operations ceased on 5 November 1963.Hanoa: 171 Lyng's Cabinet would only last 28 days, before SF supported a new vote of mis-confidence and helped appoint Gerhardsen's Fourth Cabinet. The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority originally announced on 31 October that four people would be prosecuted, although this was dropped by the Director of Public Prosecutions on 29 April 1964. The decision in Parliament called for the termination of mining operations, but the site was to be kept in such a state that production could resume at a later date should new technology make mining safe. Kings Bay went through a gradual shut-down, first closing its office in Harstad and then in 1964, Ny-√Ölesund.Hanoa: 174 The company retained a small workforce in Ny-√Ölesund to keep guard and clean up.Hanoa: 17 Research Ny- √Ölesund Airport, Hamnerabben opened in 1967 With the establishment of the European Space Research Organization in 1964, Ny-√Ölesund was approved as one of four sites for a telemetry station of the European Space Tracking Network.Kriege and Russo: 53 Specifically, Kongsfjord Telemetry Station was to track and communicate with the ESRO-1 and ESRO-2 satellites.Kriege and Russo: 59 Royal Norwegian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (NTNF) was awarded the job of operating the station.Tamnes (1992): 61 As with nearly all new Norwegian activity, the establishment was met with Soviet protests.Ulfstein: 355 Construction started in May 1965 and NTNF planned to employ as much existing facilities as they could. NTNF was allowed to use buildings as needed for free. In exchange, NTNF maintained the entire village and paid insurance on the buildings they used.Hanoa: 183 With the telemetry station came the need for an airport to fly magnetic tapes to Germany. A road was built from the settlement to Hamnerabben, the site of the telemetry station. The top of the hill was sufficiently flat that a runway could be constructed. It was built by giving a long straight section of the road a width of . Waste oil was poured on the gravel to bind it. A smaller road was built to the north of the runway to allow road transport while the runway was in use.Hanoa: 185 Services were originally operated by Ski- og Sj√∏fly, but were later taken over by Svalbard-Fly,Hanoa: 209 both of which had their Cessna 185 aircraft stationed in Ny-√Ölesund. An old mining train which was preserved during the 1980s Troms Fylkes Dampskibsselskap resumed operation of the hotel in 1965, which it leased for free. They only operated for two seasons, which about thirty patrons per year, losing money both years. The Norwegian Polar Institute established a scientific station in the town in 1966, and they moved an ionosphere measurement station from Isfjord Radio to Ny-√Ölesund and stationed two staff there.Hanoa: 177 Kings Bays operations during the second half of the 1960s was minimal, typically sending two men for guard and maintenance each summer. By 1968 there were 31 people working at the telemetry station. The Polar Institute increased its activity in Ny-√Ölesund from 1968, although its winter population was limited to one.Hanoa: 178 Kings Bay carried out work to secure its mining claims in its area, but it needed exemption if it was to succeed at keeping the claims, which would variously be canceled between 1966 and 1970.Hanoa: 179 After the initial ESRO program was initiated, the agency moved towards satellites with a higher orbital eccentricity and escape orbits. The facilities in Ny-√Ölesund were unsuitable for telemetry with such satellites, as they would operate at a different frequency, the size of the antenna dish was too small and the ground station's geographical position was out of range. Because of the change of ESRO's focus, the need for a telemetry station on Svalbard disappeared after the termination of ESRO's initial program,Kriege and Russo: 142 and the facility was closed in 1974.√òvregard: 330 After the telemetry station closed in 1974, the airport was taken over by Kings Bay.Holm: 97 Svalbard Airport, Longyear, opened in 1975, allowing better facilities and connection with scheduled flights to the mainland. At the same time, Lufttransport established itself at Svalbard Airport and took over the flights to Ny-√Ölesund.Holm: 129 The Ministry of Industry proposed in 1970 that Kings Bay be merged with another state-owned mining company, Adventdalens Kullfelt. This was not carried out as Kings Bay's board insisted on retaining its independence.Hanoa: 199 Various companies were interested in leasing part of Ny-√Öleund, including Norsk Polar Navigasjon, and various fishery groups, although no agreements were struck.Hanoa: 181 Kings Bay had no permanent employees by 1970,Hanoa: 180 but resumed operation of Ny- √Ölesund in 1974. Bj√∏rn√∏en, which previously operated a mine on Bj√∏rn√∏ya, received a common administration and board with Kings Bay from 1975.Hanoa: 189 By 1977 Kings Bay stuck a deal by the then state-owned Store Norske to sell all its claims, although it kept the property rights around Ny-√Ölesund. Tourists visit the world's northernmost post office During the first winter there were five people who stayed the winter. Research expeditions were carried out by the Norwegian Polar Institute, typically with twenty people. Also the University of Cambridge and the University of Trondheim sent annual expeditions of a similar size.Hanoa: 200 An early scientific agent was the Norwegian Institute for Air Research, which has conducted air research in Ny- √Ölesund since the mid-1970s.Hanoa: 211 The most prominent project was the Man and the Biosphere Project, which later also saw participation from the University of Troms√∏ and the University of Bergen and lasted until 1985.Hanoa: 201 Additional international universities started sending expeditions in the latter half of the 1970s, such as the Max Planck Institute, Louisiana State University and the Danish Space Research Institute.Hanoa: 202 The number of guest days for researchers and students reached 2,059 in 1980. A radio line repeater was installed at Kongsvegpasset in 1980, resulting in Ny-√Ölesund receiving a telephone connection.Hanoa: 203 Kings Bay also generated revenue from selling fuel, supplies and air transport to shrimp fishers.Hanoa: 206 From the 1970s the Coast Guard started calling regularly at Ny-√Ölesund to assist in the transport of scientific instruments.Hanoa: 208 During the early 1980s a plan for cultural heritage management was developed, which included the renovation of several older houses. Members of the Norwegian Railway Club restored a train which was put on display. Ny-√Ölesund Town and Mine Museum opened in 1988. Very little of the town was listed with the initial pre-1900 conservation rules from 1974, but from 1992 larger parts were listed following automatic listing of all pre-1945 human traces.Hanoa: 210 There had also since the 1970s been irregular visits by artists. From 1986 a building was refurbished to allow for an artist to stay there at any time. By 1985 there were sixteen universities with scientific activities. In 1987 the University of Troms√∏ built a scientific greenhouse next to the school and by 1987 Kings Bay had twenty people working in Ny-√Ölesund during the summer. Construction of the gondola to Zeppelinfjellet started in 1988 Preparation of the Norwegian Polar Institute's Zeppelin Station commenced in 1988, which included the construction of an aerial tramway. Kings Bay moved its head office from Oslo to Ny-√Ölesund in 1990. New laboratories were built for the Natural Environment Research Council, the Alfred Wegener Institute and SINTEF in 1990 and 1991.Hanoa: 214 From 1990 the Norwegian Mapping Authority moved into the old telemetry station and the following year Japan's National Institute of Polar Research moved into a renovated building at Hamnerabben. Lufttransport started serving the community with fixed-wing aircraft instead of helicopters.Hanoa: 216 A 1992 government report concluded that Svalbard should focus on becoming an international research community, and the authorities started permitting foreign research institutes to establish permanents stations in Ny- √Ölesund.Thuesen: 171 Kings Bay sold 7,521 guest days in 1991, 1,720 of which were to researchers.Thuesen: 172 The docks received a total renovation in 1992 for NOK 18 million, allowing cruise ships to dock in port.Thuesen: 173 The following year a 60-person caf√© was completed.Thuesen: 175 The Norwegian Mapping Authority completed its continental drift station in 1994, at the same time as a satellite communication link opened on Zeppelinfjellet.Thuesen: 178 By 1996 there were over one hundred research projects in Ny-√Ölesund,Thuesen: 183 and the town reaches a capacity for 200 people two years later.Thuesen: 190 On 6 May 1998, Kings Bay Kull.

It was founded in 1924 and was built in 1945. It is situated next to Pine Ridge Secondary School just off Finch Avenue in north Pickering. History =Foundation= In 1924, an advert was placed in a newspaper for the start of a lay Ignatian spirituality retreat. This was followed by a retreat in early September 1925 by thirteen men at St. Augustine's Seminary in Toronto. The organizer was Senator Frank O'Connor and Fr. John M. Filion SJ and Fr. Joseph Fallon SJ were the directors. This was followed by others retreats at the seminary, at Martyrs' Shrine in Midland and at Regis College when it was on Wellington Street.History from Manresa Canada, retrieved 1 April 2014 In 1940, one wing of Regis College was converted so that retreats could be held also during the winter months.History from Regis College, Toronto retrieved 1 April 2014 Members of the Sodality of Our Lady of the Way (which became the Christian Life Community) went on retreats at the college. By 1945, Fr. James Fleming SJ became the director and with the number of retreatants growing decided to establish a permanent centre. A building was bought in Erindale, Mississauga. It was named the Manresa Retreat House Centre, after Manresa in Spain, where the founder of the Jesuits, Ignatius of Loyola stayed in solitude for a year. It opened in November 1946 and had accommodation for eighteen retreatants. As soon as it opened, demand for retreats was more numerous that the centre could accommodate. Three years later the final retreat was held at Erindale. Manresa in Pickering opened its doors several days later with nineteen men on a retreat directed by Fr. Joe Clarke SJ. As there was no fixed fee, each retreatant making an offering according to his/her means. In 1990, a development committee was formed to raise funds. Over the next decade major improvements were made at the Manor House and the Retreat House parts of the centre as well as a new St. Ignatius Chapel and prayer centre were built. =Property= The property of the retreat centre was previously called Clarendon Wood. In 1912 it was purchased by Lord Hyde, George Villiers, and Lord Somers, Arthur Somers-Cocks, to be a home for the two families. The place was originally a 100-acre farm. Lord Hyde built a large house, known as the Manor House, within the property in summer of 1912. During the construction, the lords gave a tour of the property to the Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, the third son of Queen Victoria, and his family. Both families remained there until the outbreak of the First World War. In 1914, George Villiers became the sixth Earl of Clarendon. In 1931, he would become the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa. Lord Somers fought at Ypres in the war and in 1926 became the Governor of Victoria. The house remained unoccupied until 1922 when it was sold to a business man, Victor Ross, a vice- president of Imperial Oil. He had the house and garden mended. In 1948, the house was sold to the Jesuits. Overview The centre is located in north Pickering beside other Jesuit centres such as the La Storta community house and the Rene Goupil House retirement community.Rene Goupil House retrieved 1 April 2014 It has numerous buildings such as the Retreat House where the accommodation is located and the Manor House where meals are prepared.

Biography Devine's career at the CIA spanned from the late 1960s to the early 1990s, including the fall of President Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973, the Iran‚ÄìContra affair in the mid-1980s, and the fight to push the Soviets out of Afghanistan in the late 1980s. Devine retired after serving as both the Acting Director and Associate Director of the CIA's operations outside the United States, a capacity in which he had supervisory authority over thousands of CIA employees involved in sensitive missions throughout the world. Devine joined the CIA in 1967, after his wife gave him a book about the CIA and its role in U.S. national security. Devine completed his training at \\"the Farm\\" and various other espionage and paramilitary courses. In his first Headquarters assignment he spent time as a ‚Äúdocuments analyst‚Äù where he shared close quarters with Aldrich \\"Rick\\" Ames, who later became a spy for the Soviet Union. Ames would later reemerge as an employee and suspect in the hunt for a mole within the Agency. His first overseas assignment was to Santiago, Chile in August, 1971. Devine learned the ins and outs of recruiting sources and running covert action operations in the time before the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat. His service on the Afghan Task Force was perhaps the pinnacle of his varied career, and put him at the head of the largest covert action campaign of the Cold War. Devine replaced Gust Avrakotos, the chief of the South Asia Operations Group portrayed by actor Philip Seymour Hoffman in the 2007 film, Charlie Wilson's War, and inherited a program funneling hundreds of millions of dollars to the Afghan mujahideen. It was under Devine that the CIA ramped up threefold support to the mujahideen and made the critical decision to provide them with U.S.-made Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, a move that would ultimately shift the course of the war and force a Soviet retreat. By the time Devine left the Task Force for an assignment as Chief of Station in Rome, the war was winding down. Devine would go on to run the Counter Narcotics Center and Latin America Division at CIA in the 1990s, and helped oversee the operation that captured Pablo Escobar in 1993. He also served as the head of the division during the military intervention in Haiti in the early 1990s, and was later promoted to Associate Director and Acting Director of Operations. Devine retired from CIA in 1999, after 32 years, and joined the private sector where he joined forces with New York litigation attorney Stanley Arkin. Together they have provided high-end consulting services along with sophisticated international intelligence and investigative services for the last 15 years. Devine is the recipient of the Agency's Distinguished Intelligence Medal and several meritorious awards. He is a recognized expert in intelligence matters and has written op-eds and articles for The Washington Post, The Financial Times, The Miami Herald and The World Policy Journal. He has also made guest appearances on CBS, NBC, MSNBC, Fox News, as well as the History and Discovery channels, PBS and ABC Radio.

It was the second of three sequels to Walsh's 1926 film, What Price Glory?, with McLaglen and Lowe reprising their roles.The AFI Catalog of Feature Films:..Women of All Nations Plot The film opens at the end of World War I, with lifelong rivals Captain Jim Flagg and Sergeant Harry Quirt in the trenches. After the war ends, both men re-enlist, and the film follows their adventures through the Philippines, Asia, and the Panama Canal. After a stint in the brig, Flagg is given command of a recruiting office in Brooklyn, New York, where he works with Olsen, who has a persistent sneezing problem, much to the annoyance of Flagg. Quirt, meanwhile has been discharged. When a local \\"joint\\" is raided by the police, Flagg discovers it is being run by Quirt, and he forces Quirt to re-enlist, or be turned over to the police. Flagg has been highly unsuccessful as a recruiter, managing only a single other recruit, Izzy Kaplan, who Flagg promised to look after to his father. They are sent to Sweden, where a love triangle develops between Flagg, Quirt and a dancer they meet in a caf√©, Elsa. Elsa's boyfriend, Olaf, eventually intervenes, and the three Marines leave Sweden, bound to Nicaragua, to help out in earthquake rescue and relief efforts. During the efforts, Izzy is killed, and Flagg digs out a buried marine, discovering it is Quirt. Their final mission takes them to the Mid-East, where they find Elsa as a favorite in a harem. She had arrived there from Paris, where she had met Prince Hassan, in whose harem she now finds herself. Quirt, Flagg and Olsen rescue Elsa from the Harem, sneaking her out in an enclosed harem chair. As they argue about who will end up with Elsa, they hear Olsen's sneeze from within the chair, and they understand that Olsen will wind up with Elsa, much to the chagrin of the other two Marines.

In his autobiography, Walsh did not have too much positive to say about the film, calling it \\"...a turkey because it could not be anything else. A third McLaglen-Lowe film was too much for the public; I had been afraid of this from the start. It should have been called \`The League of Nations,' because it flopped just as hard.\\" Notes Humphrey Bogart was cast in the role of Stone in the film, but in the final edited version, none of his scenes made it to the screen. This was the second sequel to Walsh's 1926 film What Price Glory, the first being Walsh's film, The Cock-Eyed World, released in 1929. A third sequel, entitled, Hot Pepper, was directed by John Blystone and released in 1933, with McLaglen and Lowe once again reprising their roles.

It was founded in 1891 by the Society of Jesus originally on Chemin Sainte-Foy. In 1921, it moved close to Parc des Braves. It is now situated on Louis Fr√©chette next to St. Charles Garnier College () History = Chemin Sainte-Foy = The original Jesuit college in Quebec (which the Jesuit Chapel was originally part of) was seized by British forces in 1776. In 1891, a Jesuit priest, Fr. Edward D√©sy bought Teviot House on Chemin Sainte-Foy and turned it into Villa Manresa. It was to provide local individual and group retreats in Ignatian spirituality. With the influx of people in what previously a rural area, a new chapel was built next to Villa Manresa between 1893 and 1895. It was called Our Lady of the Way (Notre-Dame-du-Chemin). With the increased urbanization of the area, the chapel became a parish church in 1909. In 1911, an annex was created connecting Villa Manresa and the church together, so that the villa could also be used as a presbytery. = Parc des Braves = The Church of Our Lady of the Way on Avenue des √ârables, demolished in 1999 In 1921, the Jesuits left the presbytery and then the church. Both were given to the Archdiocese of Quebec. They moved Villa Manresa to a site neighbouring Parc des Braves. In 1930, construction work on a new, larger, Church of Our Lady of the Way on Avenue des √ârables started, so previous church and villa/presbytery were sold to the Sisters of the Holy Family of Bordeaux in 1936. The old Teviot House was demolished and a hospital was built in its place. It was called St. Anne's Hospital. In 1980 it became Courchesne Hospital. In 1986, the first Our Lady of the Way Church was also demolished. While this happened the Villa Manresa near Parc des Braves continued to function until 1977. The street names in the Sainte-Foy area refer to previous locations of Villa Manresa. There is an Avenue de Manr√®se behind Courchesne Hospital. Edward D√©sy is remembered by Avenue D√©sy off Chemin Sainte-Foy. There is an Avenue Casot, which refers to Jean-Joseph Casot. The previous site of Villa Manresa near Parc des Braves is indicated by the apartment blocks collectively referred to as Manresa Gardens. = Rue Nicolas Pinel = In 1976, the Villa Manresa became the Ignatian Spirituality Centre and moved from Parc des Braves to Rue Nicolas Pinel, next to C√©gep de Sainte-Foy, to the north of the main campus of Laval University. It also expanded its program for human and spiritual education. In 1995, the Ignatian Spirituality Centre adopted a new constitution, restructured its programs and was renamed the Manresa Spirituality Centre.History from CentreManrese.org, retrieved 2 April In 1999, the Church of Our Lady of the Way on Avenue des √ârables was also demolished.

Both males and females are equally affected. Individuals diagnosed with otodental syndrome can be of any age; age is not a relevant factor. Currently there are no specific genetic treatments for otodental syndrome. Dental and orthodontic management are the recommended course of action.  Symptoms  Symptoms of otodental syndrome can and usually appear in early development and progress with age. Although the specific frequency of the symptoms is not known, the duration is recognized to be for life; assuming no treatment has been undergone. The symptoms are variable to each individual, can range greatly in severity and are dependent on gene expression. More severe symptoms include: * Globodontia ‚Äì an abnormal condition that can occur in both primary and secondary tooth development, in which the molars and canines are greatly enlarged. It refers to the enlarged bulbous fused malformed posterior teeth with almost no discernible cusps or grooves. The molars are known to have a rounded globe- like shape. Can attribute to pain. * Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) ‚Äì also known as nerve related hearing loss, is a form of hearing loss associated with complications within the inner ear.\\"Types, Causes and Treatment  Hearing Loss Association of America.\\" HLAA Updates.

This results in an enlarged pulp chamber, lack of proper bonding at the cementoenamel junction, and can cause the pulpal floor to be displaced towards the root.Rajendran R. Shafer's Text Book of Oral Pathology. 7th ed. New Delhi (India): Elsevier (Reed Elsevier India); 2009. Developmental disturbances of oral and paraoral structures; p. 45. Discomfort and pain are usually associated with these characteristics. * Endodontic- Periodontic lesions ‚Äì oral lesions that can potentially form into abscesses. May cause further soreness and pain. Other possible, less severe, symptoms involve: * Absent premolars ‚Äì individuals suffering from otodental syndrome will typically lack the ability to develop premolars due to its genetic related affects. * Ocular coloboma ‚Äì an existent hole within the eye of the individual. The hole can be present in either the iris, choroid, optic disc, or retina and is acquired during early/prenatal development. Individuals with these symptoms may exhibit sensitivity to light, blurred vision, and/or blind spots; depending on the size of the missing tissue and its location in the eye.  Mechanism  Otodental syndrome is a rare condition that is genetically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Although there is no specific biological mechanism for otodental syndrome, what is recognized is that there is a genetic mutation, known as haploinsufficiency, that occurs in the fibroblast growth factor 3 (FGF3) gene (11q13). This is the alleged cause of the physical abnormalities and symptoms associated with otodental syndrome. Although in individuals with signs of ocular coloboma, a microdeletion in the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) gene (11q13.3) was also found to be responsible. There is variable penetrance and variable gene expression within these genetic mutations. Individuals with sensorineural hearing loss are believed to have a local lesion in the auditory segment of the inner ear, known as the cochlea. The biological mechanism for this is currently unknown as well.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis of otodental syndrome was established using clinical, histopathological and audiometric methodologies. In normal individuals, by the age of 2-3, radiograph images should depict any signs of premolar development. A formal diagnosis of no premolar growth can be done by age 6 in order to check for signs of otodental syndrome. Sensorineural hearing loss can be another measure for proper diagnosis as well as checking for ocular coloboma. The latter is usually noticed at an around birth. Molecular genetic testing can aid in the diagnosis of the affected individual, which would determine if there are any abnormalities in the FGF3 gene (11q13) or the FADD gene (11q13.3). Additional tests that can help diagnose otodental syndrome are ear infection tests, hearing tests, oral examination, and eye examinations to check for the specific phenotypic associations. Due to the rarity of otodental syndrome, most symptoms are looked at on an individual basis unless multiple symptoms are all apparent at once. There is potential for differential diagnosis due to similarities in symptoms. Other diseases that share common symptoms are chondroectodermal dysplasia, achondrodysplasia, and osteopetrosis  Treatment  There is currently no specified treatment for individuals suffering from otodental syndrome. Considering that there are many possible genetic and phenotypic associations with the condition, treatment is provided based on each individual circumstance. It is recommended that those affected seek ear, nose & throat specialists, dental health specialists, and facial oral health specialists immediately; in order to determine potential treatment options. Common treatment methods given are: * Dental treatment/management ‚Äì which can be complex, interdisciplinary and requires a regular follow up. Tooth extraction(s)and if needed, medications may be administered for pain, anxiety, and anti-inflammation. The affected individual is usually placed on a strict and preventative dental regiment in order to maintain appropriate oral hygiene and health. * Endodontic treatment ‚Äì individuals consult with an endodontist to analyze the individuals dental pulp. Typically endodontic treatment proves to be difficult due to duplicated pulp canals within the affected teeth. There may be a need for multiple extractions as well. Dental prosthesis and/or dental implants may be necessary for individuals that lack proper oral function, appearance, and comfort. * Orthodontic treatment ‚Äì given the predicament of the size and location of the affected oral area, molars and canines, orthodontic treatment is generally required in order treat any problems associated with the individuals bite pattern and tooth appearance. * Hearing aids ‚Äì in some cases affected individuals will suffer from hearing imparities and it may be necessary for hearing aid use. Prognosis The functional prognosis is mostly good with those that suffer from otodental syndrome. Appropriate dental treatment, hearing aids, and visitation to necessary specialists are recommended. Quality of life may be affected by psychological and functional aspects. It is also recommended that genetic counseling be given to families that have or may have this condition.  Recent research  Currently there are no open research studies for otodental syndrome.ClinicalTrials.gov. A Service of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, n.d. Web. 04 Mar. 2014. Due to the rarity of this disease, current research is very limited. The most recent research has involved case studies of the affected individuals and/or families,K Colter JD, Sedano HO. Otodental syndrome: A Case Report. Pediatr Dent. 2005 Nov- Dec;27(6):482-5 all of which show the specific phenotypic symptoms of otodental syndrome. Investigations on the effects of FGF3 and FADD have also been performed. These studies have shown successes in supporting previous studies that mutations to FGF3 and neighboring genes may cause the associated phenotypic abnormalities.Sensi, Alberto, Stefano Ceruti, Patrizia Trevisi, Francesca Gualandi, Micol Busi, Ilaria Donati, Marcella Neri, Alessandra Ferlini, and Alessandro Martini. \\"LAMM Syndrome with Middle Ear Dysplasia Associated with Compound Heterozygosity for FGF3 Mutations.\\" American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A 155.5 (2011): 1096-101 According to recent studies involving zebrafish embryos, there is also support in that the FADD gene contributed to ocular coloboma symptoms as well. Future research studies are required in order to better grasp the specific relationship between the gene involved and its effect on various tissues and organs such as teeth, eyes, and ear. Little is known and there is still much to be determined.

She has written four books dealing with subjects ranging from gender and feminism to the works of Jacques Derrida, Luce Irigaray, and Simone de Beauvoir. In 2002-3, Deutscher also served as the Lane Professor for the Humanities at the Alice Berline Kaplan Center for the Humanities at Northwestern University. Education and career Deutscher received her bachelor's from the University of Sydney in 1986 and went on to receive a Dipl√¥me des √©tudes approfondies at the University of Paris in 1991 and a doctorate in philosophy from the University of New South Wales in 1993. Deutscher served as an associate lecturer in philosophy at the University of New South Wales in 1992 before becoming a lecturer and then senior lecturer in philosophy at the Australian National University from 1992 to 2001. Deutscher moved to Northwestern University in 2002, accepting an appointment as the Lane Professor for the Humanities in 2002-3, and then serving as an associate professor from 2002 to 2008 before being promoted to full professor in 2008. Besides for her permanent appointments, Deutscher also served as the Marie- Jahoda guest professor at Ruhr University Bochum in 2013. Research areas and publications Deutscher has authored five books, including Yielding Gender: Feminism, Deconstruction and the History of Philosophy (1997), A Politics of Impossible Difference: The Later Work of Luce Irigaray (2002), How to Read Derrida (2006), The Philosophy of Simone de Beauvoir: Ambiguity, Conversion, Resistance (2008), and Foucault's Futures: A Critique of Reproductive Reason (2017). Deutscher has also edited or co-edited four books, Repenser le politique: l‚Äôapport du f√©minisme (2004), Enigmas: Essays on Sarah Kofman (1999), (with Olivia Custer and Samir Haddad) Foucault/Derrida Fifty Years Later (2016), and (with Cristina Lafont) Critical Theory in Critical Times (2017). Deutscher has also written a large number of refereed articles, contributed more than 26 book chapters, several encyclopedia articles, and a number of book reviews. Deutscher's first book, Yielding Gender: Feminism, Deconstruction and the History of Philosophy, engaged the works of Judith Butler and Eve Sedgwick with that of Jacques Derrida to create a novel analysis of the instability of the meaning of woman throughout the history of philosophy. Deutscher's second book, A Politics of Impossible Difference: The Later Work of Luce Irigaray, provides a close reading of the work of Luce Irigaray, arguing that Irigaray's work stresses the importance of the value of difference, especially those differences that the hegemon is most interested in actively excluding. Deutscher's third book, How to Read Derrida, provides an introduction to the works of Jacques Derrida, focusing on his approach to deconstructionism. The Philosophy of Simone de Beauvoir: Ambiguity, Conversion, Resistance examines Beauvoir's style of building theory upon theory, arguing that building theories upon each other that simultaneously undermine each other does not diminish the significance or results of the study, and focuses in large part on two of Beauvoir's most significant concepts, sexual and generational alterity.

He was badly wounded by a suspected cattle rustler near the town of Pantano on December 2, 1914, and died about a week later in a Tucson hospital. Biography The old Pete Kitchen Ranch house in 1937. James Arthur \\"Jimmie\\" Mercer was born in England on August 12, 1871, and was the eldest child of Andrew Valentine Mercer and Isabella Katherine Newton. Jimmie was named after Andrew's father, James Arthur Mercer (1812-1878). In 1883, Jimmie and his parents emigrated to the United States and settled down in Tubac, Arizona, where Andrew's elder brother, T. Lillie Mercer, had previously settled. Andrew and Isabella divorced when Jimmie was twelve-years-old, after which he was raised by a family friend named Pete Kitchen. According to Jimmie's nephew, Art Mercer: \\"Jimmie lived with Pete and his family until he was 14 or 15 years old.... Pete was quite a desperado. When some squaws tried to steal his horses, Jimmie killed two of the women.\\" Jimmie's first marriage was to Bessie Pearl McKinney, who was born in 1883, in Uvalde, Texas, and was the daughter of a well known and respected pioneer rancher. The two were married in Mammoth, Arizona, on July 16, 1898. Jimmie was popular and respected. He worked as a Pima County deputy sheriff and later a county ranger. The Mercers had three sons: Arthur Virgil Mercer, who was born on January 3, 1900, Caddell Newton Mercer, who was born on April 21, 1903, and Edgar Leslie Mercer, born on February 10, 1906. With his second wife, Harriett Ann Brown, Jimmie had a fourth son named James Arthur Mercer, Jr. just before his death on December 10, 1914. On December 2, 1914, Mercer and a local rancher named Robert Fenton were out investigating a police report for some stolen cattle. According to the report, a Mexican rancher named J. Padilla was in possession of a stolen calf, so the two men headed for Padilla's ranch, which was located just north of what is now the ghost town of Pantano. As Mercer and Fenton approached the little ranch, Padilla began walking towards them. However, when about seventy yards away from Mercer, Padilla raised his rifle and fired once at him. The bullet struck Mercer in the left leg, just above the knee. As Mercer fell to the ground, Padilla turned around and fled into a nearby canyon. Mercer was then taken back to Pantano, where he was put on a train and sent to Rogers Hospital in Tucson. Mercer's wound was bad; the bullet struck him just above the knee, breaking his leg, and he was bleeding a lot. Ultimately, he died from the loss of blood several days later on December 10, and was buried in the Evergreen Memorial Park in Tucson. He was survived by his wife, two brothers, and three sisters. There is no record of whether or not the killer was ever apprehended. Today there is a small memorial for Mercer near Pantano, at the Ci√©nega Creek Natural Preserve. The Pete Kitchen Ranch, near Nogales, Arizona, is also on display and has been listed on the National Historic Register since 1975.

Plot  Aunt Gertrude's antique 16th century clock, when run backwards by two boys, is found to reverse the flow of time. This enables the boys to time-travel and participate in a short Henty-like historical adventure in which they help to relieve the 16th century Spanish siege of Leiden. Publication history This short story for boys was published anonymously in The Sun newspaper on September 18, 1881, and not thereafter collected or publicised. As such it was a very ephemeral and slight work for juveniles, and it was not noticed by the critics of the time.Bleiler, Everett F., Science Fiction: The Early Years, Kent State University Press, 1990, page 509. Rediscovery The story was rediscovered in the 1970s, and published in 1973 by Sam Moskowitz in his collection The Tachypomp and Other Stories which assembled Mitchell's seven fantasy and science-fiction stories published from 1874-1881. The story is now regarded as the first known instance of using a device for time travel and the first instance of a temporal paradox in fiction. Any influence it may have had on later writers is however uncertain. Given its publication history in an American daily newspaper, it is very unlikely that the British writers H. G. Wells and Lewis Carroll knew of the story before they wrote their works which used devices or machines to time- travel.

The film was followed by a sequel, Tiger Cage 2, released two years later in 1990 featuring a new storyline, with Yuen returning as director and cast members, Yen and Cheng, returning in different roles. Plot Inspector Michael Wong (Simon Yam), alongside Shirley Ho (Carol Cheng), Brother Lung (Bryan Leung), Fan Chun-yau (Jacky Cheung), Uncle Tat (Ng Man-tat) and Terry (Donnie Yen) are all part of the Anti-Drug Unit of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force. The relationship between them are like brothers in general. During an operation, they worked together to bust a drug den but the chief drug trafficker, Swatow Hung (Wang Lung-wei), escaped. Just as they were celebrating their success, Hung found them and killed Lung. In order to avenge Lung and find Hung, they took a variety of means and finally found and killed Hung. During an accident, Yau filmed Tat trading with a drug trafficker and tells Terry and Michael. After Michael found out, in order to protect himself, he killed Terry and framed Yau, who was then suspended from duty, which caused Yau to suspect something fishy. One day, Yau's girlfriend, Amy (Irene Wan,) found a copy of Yau's videotape at home and discovered that Michael and Tat were accomplices. Shortly after Yau and Michael arrive to pick up the tape, but in order to save Yau, she handed the tape to Michael. Michael then ordered an assassin to kill her. But Amy was able to call Shirley and inform her of Michael's operations. At this point, Yau and Shirley discover the truth to everything, that Hung luckily escaped from the drug bust earlier and came back to revenge on Lung, who was an undercover cop, on the night before his wedding with Shirley. Yau vows to bring the perpetrator to justice and dig out the mole inside the police force.

The Republican forces had been campaigning against Guayana from late 1816, though hindered by lack of a navy. Their goal was to occupy the towns of Angostura and Old Guayana, which would allow them to dominate traffic along the river Orinoco. Manuel Piar had taken the missions of Caroni in early 1817, which had served as an important supply base for the royalist Spanish forces; it would thereafter fill the same role for the revolutionaries. With the loss of the missions, the places held by the royalists were largely without a source to supply their armies & were at risk of hunger. Brigadier La Torre left Angostura for the missions in order to reconquer the area and its resources. It had about 1,600 infantry, 200 cavalry and 2 guns with him, and traveled to the missions through the castles of old Guayana. On April 11 the Spaniards met Piar, who led a force of 500 riflemen, 800 lancers, 500 Indian archers and 400 horsemen. The patriots, which infantry were surpassed in number and experience by the royalists', won in a short battle thanks to the superiority of the republican cavalry. Piar fought in this battle \\"all alone\\" (that is, with newly formed officers, mostly unknown before and after the battle). The destruction of the royalist forces in San Felix accelerated the capitulation of Angostura. The town would be abandoned by the Spaniards on the 17th of that month. Thanks to the Battle of San F√©lix, the Venezuelan patriots won not only the rich territory of Guayana, but also the critical tool of transportation and commerce, the Orinoco. C√©sar Zumeta, referring to Piar and San Felix, said: \\"[Piar] formed an army, triumphed by foresight and courage, and became the first to build an indestructible foundation for the homeland and make possible the organization of the Republic. All that came after San Felix. The campaign was the most momentous in Guiana and one of the most beautiful of our historical cycle.\\"  References  * Mejias, Alejandro (2000) [1997] Diccionario de Historia de Venezuela: Campa√±as terrestres de la Independencia.

Its predecessor, Shakespeare Santa Cruz, lost the financial support of its host and sponsor, the University of California, Santa Cruz in 2013. Members of the original company immediately began fundraising and raised enough money to relaunch the festival as an independent entity.  History  Shakespeare Santa Cruz was founded in 1981 by Audrey Stanley and performed annually on the campus of the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). Plays by Shakespeare (and others) were performed both indoors on the UCSC Theater Arts Mainstage and outdoors in the Sinsheimer-Stanley Festival Glen. Usually, the company's season ran from July to early September and presented three or four plays that ran concurrently in repertory. Over time, the company ran up deficits, which were paid by the University of California. In 2008, with California's budget crisis having resulted in reduced funding, the university could no longer afford to cover these debts. An agreement was reached that if the theater could raise $300,000, it could continue operation. Within 10 days of the agreement's announcement, over $400,000 was raised. However, claiming continuing financial problems, in 2013 the UCSC Arts Division dean announced that Shakespeare Santa Cruz would end after that year's winter holiday production. Following this announcement, members of the theater company began a campaign to raise money to become an independent company. In December 2013, a new entity known as Shakespeare Play On was formed for this purpose, co-headed by Shakespeare Santa Cruz artistic director Marco Baricelli and actor/director Mike Ryan. An online platform for accepting donations was established with the Network for Good. By February 2014, they raised over $1 million (USD) through crowdfunding to continue on without the financial support of the university. In March 2014, the new company changed its name to Santa Cruz Shakespeare. The New York Times referred to the company's rebirth as an \\"underdog success story.\\" For its inaugural season under its new arrangement, Santa Cruz Shakespeare presented As You Like It, The Merry Wives of Windsor, and The Beard of Avon in July and August 2014. All three shows were performed in the Sinsheimer-Stanley Festival Glen on UCSC's campus. For the 2015 season Mike Ryan took over sole Artistic Director duties and the company announced productions of Much Ado About Nothing, Macbeth, and David Ives's adaptation of Pierre Corneille's The Liar. For the 2016 season the company moved to a new purpose-built home in the Audrey Stanley Grove at Upper DeLaveaga Park in Santa Cruz.

K. It was built at Kobe, Japan and commissioned on 31 October 1944 to support the war effort by transporting oil, and was later refitted as a whaling factory ship. World War II On 15 January 1945, while the Hashidate Maru was docked at the Hong Kong port, an American carrier aircraft began attacks that caused light damage to the oil tanker. The next day, as it is moved to the dockyard for repairs, it was lightly damaged by near misses. When the battle ended, the Japanese claimed they had shot down 22 enemy aircraft, but took serious damage to three tankers and light damage to three escorts. On 1 February 1945, the Hashidate Maru departed Hong Kong in a convoy with four Type 2TE tankers. Soon after, she struck a naval mine and began to settle, but emergency repairs contained the flooding. On 15 August 1945, it docked at Osaka for repairs and surrendered to the Allied Forces in September 1945. Whaling General Douglas MacArthur, as military governor of Japan in 1945, encouraged the defeated Japan to continue whaling in order to provide a cheap source of meat to its starving people, and millions of dollars in oil for the USA and Europe. The Japanese whaling industry quickly recovered as MacArthur authorized the commission of two tankers as whaling factory ships: the Hashidate Maru and Nisshin Maru No. 1, to once again take whales in the Antarctic and elsewhere. The Hashidate Maru began its reconversion to a whale factory ship by Hitachi Zosen Corporation in June 1946, with the work completed in October 1946. A refrigeration unit was installed in May 1947. The crew numbered 304, of whom 186 were factory workers, and comprised a large proportion of young men, most of them being between 15 and 20 years of age. The Hashidate Maru served as a factory whaling ship from 1946 to early 1951. Oil tanker The ship was decommissioned from whaling in 1951 and sold in May 1951 to Iino Kaiun for 45 million ¬•ens, who converted it back to an oil tanker. The Hashidate Maru then was chartered in 1952 to Standard Oil of California. It made three voyages from the Persian Gulf and Indonesia carrying crude oil to California. On 7 July 1962 it was sold to Naigai Kisen K.K. in Tokyo. The Hashidate Maru was finally sold for scrapping on 20 April 1965.

Much of his early work was in partnership with Hugh Spencely (1900‚Äì1983), a friend since they attended Harrow School together. Later he worked more as a town planner, particularly the New Town of Crawley. Early life and education Minoprio went to Harrow School and the University of Oxford, then studied for five years at the University of Liverpool's School of Architecture, where he obtained a Bachelor of Architecture degree in 1925 and an MA three years later. His Beaux-Arts training informed his later work on designing \\"visually striking\\" town plans. His architectural training also came in Liverpool under Charles Herbert Reilly, \\"a believer in grand neoclassical designs of wide avenues\\". This influenced his views on the importance of good architecture being an integral part of the town planning process and an important feature in a town's civic pride. He worked for a few months at an architectural firm in New York, then was awarded a scholarship to the British School at Rome to study architecture. He went into architectural practice in 1928 and initially worked on commissions for country houses. Career highlights In 1932, Minoprio and Spencely designed an extension to the Royal School for the Blind, Liverpool, founded in 1791 by Edward Rushton. Four years later, they designed Fairacres, Roehampton, a Grade II listed four-storey apartment block at Roehampton Lane, Roehampton, London. It was built for the property developer Charles Kearley. The block of 64 flats in a semi-elliptical arc is modern in style with 1930s curved walls, but traditional in construction. It has been very little altered since being built. The two architects worked together again between 1944 and 1946 when they produced an outline plan for the postwar redevelopment of Worcester. Their plans showed extensive areas of open space and parkland, especially around the cathedral, and a combined shopping centre and bus station, among other features. Post-war work Minoprio was heavily involved with town planning after World War II, both in England and elsewhere. In September 1944 he prepared a survey and plan for the redevelopment of part of the Essex county town, Chelmsford. He proposed major changes to the town centre, which he considered to be \\"of no particular architectural merit\\", and a riverside civic centre with surrounding open space reminiscent of Oxford and Cambridge. The \\"somewhat grandiose vision\\" was completed by two major new roads and ten residential \\"neighbourhood units\\". Nothing came of the plan, but elements of it made their way into the 1952 Development Plan for the County of Essex which guided Chelmsford's later development. Three years later, Crawley Development Corporation appointed him as consultant planner in place of Thomas Wilfred Sharp after the latter's sudden decision to resign soon after submitting his master plan‚Äî\\"an extraordinary decision [... which was] never completely explained\\". By June 1947 Minoprio had prepared a new draft plan, and this was approved and published in December 1947. This time, Minoprio's vision of a carefully planned and balanced community was seen through to its conclusion by the Development Corporation under the leadership of its \\"dogmatic and highly successful\\" chairman Thomas Bennett. Crawley is now much larger than originally anticipated: the plan's target population of 50,000 was exceeded within 13 years of work beginning, and there are now more than 105,000 residents. Nevertheless, the town's design and layout remain substantially similar to Minoprio's plan. Minoprio worked again with Spencely and another town planner, Peter Macfarlane, on master plans for several cities outside England in the 1950s and 1960s. They designed plans for Kuwait City in 1951, Baghdad in 1956, Dhaka in 1959 and Chittagong in 1961. Back in England, Minoprio later designed the Whitgift Centre, a large split-level shopping centre in Croydon. The development was built between 1965 and 1970 by Fitzroy Robinson & Partners. Architectural historians Ian Nairn and Nikolaus Pevsner stated that \\"most of the architectural details are banal, but the centre functions unusually well as a shopping precinct\\".

Broadbent) *A Restoration of the Basilica of Constantine, Rome (1932) *Chelmsford Planning Survey 1945: a Survey and Plan for Chelmsford Borough and Rural District (1945) *An Outline Development Plan for the County of the City of Worcester (1946, with Hugh Spencely) *The Town and Country Planning Act, 1947 Administration in Counties: Together With the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947 Delegation to County Districts (1948, with G.N.C.

Perchard worked as a merchant on his native island of Guernsey and the other Channel Islands. Perchard grew wealthy from privateering in the English Channel after the British government declared reprisals against the allies of the nascent United States of America. Perchard and his fellow privateers targeted ships from the French West Indies, with Perchard personally making almost ¬£10,000 from his privateering activities. Civic career He was created an alderman in the City of London's Candlewick ward on 12 April 1798 as a goldsmith. He was subsequently elected one of the Sheriffs of the City of London in 1793. Perchard was a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths. The election was held for the office of Lord Mayor on 9 October 1804. Perchard was one of three candidates, the others being his fellow Aldermen, James Shaw and Charles Flower. Perchard won 1781 votes to Shaw's 1652, and was duly declared Lord Mayor. In his acceptance speech, Perchard described himself as being \\"late of life\\" but said that \\"we cease to live when we cease to be of any use to the public\\". In his professional life, Perchard was a goldsmith. The prisoner reformer James Neild wrote to Perchard about the poor conditions at the debtors' prison in Southwark during Perchard's time as Lord Mayor but received no reply from him.

Her work primarily focuses on Plato, Aristotle, and other (primarily Greek) ancient philosophers. Education and career Gill received a bachelor's in religion in 1972 from Barnard College and a master's in religion from Columbia University in 1974. She received a second bachelor's from Cambridge University in classics and ancient philosophy in 1976, and a master's and doctorate in classics and ancient philosophy from Cambridge, both in 1981. Gill was an instructor of classics at the University of Pittsburgh from 1979 to 1981 before accepting an appointment as Assistant Professor of Classics and Philosophy there from 1981 to 1988. She was promoted to associate professor in 1988, full professor in 1994, and chaired the department from 1994 to 1997. Gill moved from Pittsburgh to Brown University as a professor of philosophy and classics in 2001, and was appointed the David Benedict Professor of Classics and Philosophy in 2013. In addition to her permanent appointments, Gill has also held a variety of visiting positions, including at Dartmouth College, Stanford University, UCLA, UC Davis, Harvard University, and the University of Paris. She has previously served as the Chair of the Faculty of Brown University, the Chair of Classics at the University of Pittsburgh, and on the editorial boards of numerous journals and books. Philosophical work Gill's work primarily focuses on ancient Greek philosophy, especially Plato and Aristotle. She has authored two books and one extensive introduction - Aristotle on Substance: The Paradox of Unity (1991), the long introduction to Plato: Parmenides (1994,) and Philosophos: Plato‚Äôs Missing Dialogue (2012.) Aristotle on Substance: The Paradox of Unity attempts to resolve the problem posed by the juxtaposition of Aristotle's requirement that primary substances have conceptual unity with the composite nature of living organisms. In Philosophos: Plato‚Äôs Missing Dialogue, Gill attempts to explain the absence of the Philosopher, a dialogue which Plato repeatedly mentions in Theaetetus, Sophist, and Statesman, but which no record exists of Plato actually having written. Previous suggestions for the absence of the Philosopher include a lack of time in Plato's later years, it forming one of Plato's unwritten doctrines, or it being unnecessary because the Sophist had included much of its intended content. Gill suggests a fourth alternative - that Plato intentionally avoided writing the Philosopher with the intent that someone who had read well Theaetetus, Sophist, and Statesman could use the pedagogical clues contained in those dialogues to reconstruct the missing Philosopher (while becoming philosophers themselves in the process.) Gill's explanation of the Philosopher has been criticized for relying excessively on the assumption that all of Plato's later philosophy was strongly Aristotelian, but her close analyses of many of the significant passages in the three dialogues her book covers has been lauded as well worthwhile.

The Security Service Law replaced the Security Service Act of 1949, which made conscription a national routine rather than only requiring military draft during national security emergencies. History Following the devastation of Europe's Jewish population during the Nazi Holocaust and coupled with the rise in Zionism since the 19th century, the United Nations General Assembly recommended the establishment of a Jewish state in the Middle Eastern province of Palestine. Following the declaration of its independence on 14 May 1948, the Arab nations of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and Iraq began to invade Palestine in an attempt to eradicate the newly formed state of Israel. On 26 May 1948, the Israeli Defense Force, or IDF, was established as Israel's official military. Formed out of the pre-1948 Jewish paramilitary organizations Haganah, Irgun and Lehi, the IDF was a conscription military divided into the army, navy, and air force branches. Immediately, the IDF drafted thousands of men into service to combat the invading Arab forces. The Security Service Act and later Security Service Law was passed in 1949 to regulate the recruitment into IDF service. The law has since gone through several revisions and alterations, most notably in 1959 and 1986. = The Law = Age The Security Service Law requires that all citizens of Israel, except those who qualify for the exemptions from service, to service in the various branches of the IDF. Section 2 defines the age appropriate for conscription, and set it at 18‚Äì29 years of age for men, and 18‚Äì26 for women, based on the Hebrew calendar. However, recruitment may begin at age 17 if the parents or guardians of the recruit allow it. Pre-service screening Section 3 through 12 gives the Israeli Secretary of Defense the authority to call citizens to medical screenings to determine if conscription is permissible. Duration of service Service for men is set at 36 months, however, recruits over the age of 27 are only required to serve for 24 months. Immigrants who arrive in Israel at the age of 27+ years are only required 18 months of service. (Article 15) Service for women is set at 24 months, yet women may volunteer for an additional 12 months under section 16a. (Article 16) Any soldier tried and found guilty by a military court or deserters who are returned to service are to have their service time extended to meet the requirements of regular service duty under Article 18. Non-military positions The Security Service Law extends to cover conscription into the Israeli Border Police, or Magav, under Article 24. Since 1995, section 24A regulated the transfer of soldiers into the Israeli Police Service, or Shaham. In 2005, Section 24 regulated the use of IDF troops as Israeli prison guards. Exemptions from service Power is given to the Israeli Defense Minister to exempt citizens from service under Section 36. Section 36A states that for regular service in the IDF, the age of the soldier shall not exceed 54 for men and 38 for women. Section 39 exempts pregnant women and current mothers from service, also married women are exempt from regular service but not reserve service. Article 40 provides the layout for what the military allows for religious exemption from service. However, this is the only exemption that may be enacted and revoked at any time by the Israeli Ministry of Defense. Male Druzes are eligible for conscription into the IDF under the Israeli Security Service Law; however, a growing controversy is the exclusion of recruiting Muslim Israeli Arabs into service. This exemption originated in 1949 and was again continued after review in 1954 and has yet to be revoked. Tal Law & Plesner Committee With growing concern over the increasing populations of yeshiva students and Arab-Israelis being exempt from IDF service, the Tal Committee was formed in 1999 to discuss and attempt to find a solution as to how to induct these members of society into the military or National Services. It was noted that at the time there were potentially 30,414 Israeli ultra-Orthodox men who were exempt but capable of entering the military. The Tal Law developed from this committee and was passed on 23 July 2002. It called for 80 percent of yeshiva students to begin the process of entering into the services. Renewal of the law was placed in 5-year increments. However, it was met with great protest from yeshiva and political members for its entirety. In 2012 the Israeli High Court determined that the law was unconstitutional. Following the courts decision, the Plesner committee was formed to again attempt a new method for inducting these segments of the population into the IDF or national Services. Due to member complications the report was left in an indeterminate state with goals set for 2016 to begin the inductions for yeshivas and Arabs into the services required. Punishments If a person attempts to dodge the draft by providing the state of Israel with false information, false medical recorders, mutilates their body or has someone else mutilate their body to avoid conscription, they may be charged and given 5 years in prison as punishment under Article 46A.

Early life Bast was born in Antwerp, and was the child of Josyntje Plantin, who was part of the famous printer Plantin family. On 31 August 1601 he married Aryaentje Geryt Schaecken in Leiden. The following year he bought a house next to the Latin School. Career Pieter Bast engraved maps and cityscapes of Dutch cities. He worked on a map of Emden. He also worked as a surveyor. The most famous of his works was the map of Amsterdam that he drew and engraved in 1599. It covered a total of four blades and is titled Amstelodamum, Hollandiae urbs primaria, emporium Totius Europae celeberrimum. Since 1544 there was no accurate city map of Amsterdam, so this work has historical significance. The map was published on 1 October 1599 by bookseller-publisher Harmen Allartz or Alardi. The card was signed Petr. Bast Au (ie auctor) et sculp (sit) et excudebat, 1599, which indicates that Pieter Bast was also editor. Later career Pieter Bast made further engravings of Middelburg, Dordrecht, Leeuwarden, Franeker, Leiden, and Utrecht. He also made engravings of historical events such as the siege and the capture of Nijmegen as part of the Dutch Revolt by Maurice, Prince of Orange on 14 October 1591, the Battle of Nieuwpoort.

Located inside a local motel that was considered modern and trendy at the time it was built, the Sip 'n Dip is known for having men or women dressed as mermaids swimming underwater in an indoor swimming pool visible through a window in the bar. Decorated with a bamboo ceiling and a South Seas theme, the bar also features \\"Piano Pat\\" Spoonheim, who has played piano there since 1963 and is noted for her unique \\"jazzy\\" style. The mermaid concept was introduced in 1995, when there was a revival of the tiki fad, and it was the brainchild of the bar's current owner, who wanted to add a \\"fun factor\\". It became popular, particularly for Montana, a landlocked northern state where a tropical tiki theme is unexpected. Beginning in 2003, the bar began to gain prominence outside of Montana, when the magazine GQ listed the lounge in its list of the top 10 bars in the world, ranking it as the \\"#1 bar...worth flying for\\". The bar employs six women, who wear mermaid outfits designed and hand-made by the bar's manager, Sandra Johnson-Thares. Mermen were brought back in 2016, having previously appeared on occasion until 2004. Prominent mermen at the lounge include Taylor Watson, who has been a prominent figure in the \\"Mermen too\\" movement. Celebrity patrons of the Sip 'n Dip have included Nick Nolte, star of The Deep, and Daryl Hannah, who reprised her portrayal of a mermaid in Splash by swimming in the pool while wearing a mermaid tail. Both actors signed the glass window, though their autographs were lost two years later when the window cracked, forcing the pool to be drained, repaired, and the double-paned glass replaced with a triple-paned version. History and design A typical evening at the Sip 'n Dip The establishment features a glass wall behind the bar looking into an indoor swimming pool where swimmers can be seen under water. It is located inside the O'Haire Motor Inn, which was built in 1962. The concept of a swimming pool designed so underwater swimmers can be viewed from inside the bar was original to the building, as the person who built the O'Haire had been inspired by a similar design he saw when visiting the Playboy Club in Chicago. When built in the 1960s, the O'Haire Motor Inn was considered \\"swank\\" and modern, and the tiki concept was popular, in part due to the then-recent admission of Hawaii to the United States as a state. The concept of a tropical theme was also viewed as a fun concept for Montana, a landlocked state with long, cold winters. Though tiki bars in general declined in popularity in the late 1970s and 1980s until the revival of the style in the 1990s, the Sip 'n Dip survived with few changes. During the 1990s, the idea of having mermaids swim in the pool during evening bar hours was the brainchild of the bar's general manager, Sandra Johnson-Thares and her mother, who wanted to add a \\"fun factor.\\" It began with a single \\"mermaid\\" in the pool on New Year's Eve in 1995. Today, Johnson-Thares makes the mermaid costumes herself and said, \\"I never in my life believed the mermaid attraction would be such a big hit. People are fascinated with them, and it's not something you'd expect to see in Montana.\\" The \\"fish bowl\\" cocktail The bar features a bamboo ceiling, traditional cocktails, local Montana microbrews, and specialty drinks such as the \\"fish bowl,\\" a cocktail that features nine shots of different liquors. It also has an outdoor patio open during the summer, from June to September. Entertainment =Piano Pat= \\"Piano Pat\\" at the organ \\"Piano Pat\\" Spoonheim plays piano four nights a week. Called \\"the heart of the Sip 'n Dip,\\" Spoonheim is an octogenarian and a great-grandmother. She performs what one reviewer described as \\"unusual covers\\" of songs, particularly those of Frank Sinatra, Neil Diamond, and Elvis Presley. She has a playing style called \\"jazzy\\" and a voice described variously as \\"lived-in\\", \\"soulful\\", and \\"husky.\\" One of her most requested covers is \\"Sweet Caroline,\\" where she often leads patrons in sing-alongs. Spoonheim was originally from Rudyard, Montana, where her family owned an auto supply store. She began playing the piano at age five, when her mother would drive her on an round trip to Havre to take classical piano lessons. By the age of 12, she was playing with adults in a dance band, earning $10 per night. She began singing as well as playing the piano during a time in her life when she lived in Billings, Montana. She was a 28-year-old divorced single mother of three when she started working as the Sip 'n Dip's piano player in 1963, taking the position as a second job in order to support her children. She simultaneously worked as a medical transcriptionist for 38 years before retiring from her day job in 2000. She celebrated 50 years of employment at the Sip 'n Dip in December 2013 and at that time she was featured on CBS Sunday Morning. She has released two albums, only for sale at the Sip 'n Dip, and though she takes requests, she refuses to play modern rock music. She continues to work because it is not only a job but also her social life, \\"It's a chance to get out of the house. I enjoy the lounge, and it keeps me going.\\" =Mermaids and swimming pool= \\"Mermaids\\" in the pool The bar employs six women part-time to wear mermaid costumes and swim in the pool five evenings a week. They are local women from all walks of life. The \\"mermaids\\" explain that it is fairly easy to stay afloat while wearing a mermaid tail, but the difficult part of the job is not floating; staying underwater as much as possible is necessary in order for patrons to see them through the window. Because they cannot use their legs in a traditional manner, they must work harder with their arms to swim. Mermen also swim in the pool. They were hired early on, but fell out of favor by about 2004. In 2016, they were brought back by popular demand, primarily working during the bar's Tuesday ladies' night. The bar's most famous patrons appeared in 2002, when Daryl Hannah, Anthony Edwards and Nick Nolte dropped by while working on the movie Northfork, which was filmed in the Great Falls area. The actors stopped by the bar and both Nolte, who had starred in The Deep, and Hannah signed the glass window. Then Hannah, who had portrayed a mermaid in Splash, donned a mermaid tail and swam in the pool. The pool is also open to motel guests, and, in spite of signs warning swimmers that they can be viewed from the bar while swimming, people have been known to skinny dip. Recognition The outdoor patio area, open in the summer The Sip 'n Dip was called a \\"Polynesia on the Plains\\" in 2013 by CBS Sunday Morning. In 2003, the magazine GQ listed the lounge as one of the top 10 bars in the world, ranking it as the \\"#1 bar...worth flying for\\". Frommer's travel guide calls it \\"one of the kitschiest, wackiest, and flat-out coolest nightspots, not just in Montana, but in the entire West.\\" In 2014, USA Today ranked the Sip 'n Dip as one of the 10 best tiki bars in the United States. In 2016, it came in second to the Club Moderne in Anaconda in a national contest by the National Trust for Historic Preservation for the title \\"America's Favorite Historic Bar\\". On November 24, 2017, The New York Times published an article, \\"Welcome to the Campiest Place on Earth,\\" about the \\"kitch-tastic tiki bar.‚Äùhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/25/style/mermaid-tiki-bar-sip-n- dip.html?emc=edit_th_20171126&nl;=todaysheadlines&nlid;=44725378 Incidents The bar faced a major crisis in October 2004 when a crack developed in the glass wall between the bar and the pool, which could have resulted in of water emptying into the bar. The bar was open when the crack occurred and was noticed immediately. Staff of the O'Haire Inn immediately began draining the pool, which took four hours to complete. The fire department also kept their pumper truck standing by in case more rapid removal of water was needed. The old double-paned glass was replaced with triple-paned glass, and while the repairs were performed the pool area was also given a new rubber coating.

Apple and pear are principally used, often with dates: other fruit such as apricot can be used as well. Sugar and other sweetners are not normally needed. Cored fruit is cooked slowly until it falls apart, releasing the pectin from the skin. The compote is then pushed through a passoir, removing the skin, and breaking the fruit into mush. It's then reduced by slow cooking over several hours until the pectin sets, in the same way jam is, tested by dropping a test piece into cold water. Typically 6-8 kg of fruit produces 1 kg of syrup.

Billings started as the substitute and had limited game time. After Round 1, Billings was dropped to the VFL for two weeks, kicking five goals for the Sandringham Zebras and was selected in the senior side the next week. In Round 14, 2014, against the West Coast Eagles, Billings kicked three goals and gathered 25 touches, earning that round‚Äôs AFL Rising Star nomination. Billings missed large parts of the 2015 and 2016 seasons with a shin injury and ankle injury respectively, but came back strong in the latter part of 2016 to poll votes in the club‚Äôs best and fairest award in four of the last five games. Billings played his 50th AFL game against Carlton in Round 8, 2017, managing 30 disposals, 12 marks and 5 goals. In August 2017, Billings signed a two-year contract extension, to remain at the club until the end of 2019. After a slump in form in the first half of the 2018 season, Billings was dropped from St Kilda‚Äôs senior team to their VFL affiliate Sandringham. In his first and only VFL game for 2018, Billings collected 53 disposals and was immediately recalled to the senior team. Prior to the 2019 season, Billings was elevated to St Kilda‚Äôs leadership group after teammate Dylan Roberton was sidelined with a heart condition. Billings played his 100th AFL game in Round 16, 2019 against North Melbourne and starred with 35 disposals. Billings finished 2019 in fourth place in St Kilda‚Äôs best and fairest. Billings signed a contract extension with St Kilda in 2019, keeping him at the club until at least the end of 2021.

They can be in the form of a hollow sphere, ellipsoid, tube, and many other shapes. Spherical azafullerenes resemble the balls used in football (soccer). They are also a member of the carbon nitride class of materials that include beta carbon nitride (Œ≤-C3N4), predicted to be harder than diamond. Besides the pioneering work of a couple of academic groups, this class of compounds has so far garnered little attention from the broader fullerene research community. Many properties and structures are yet to be discovered for the highly-nitrogen substituted subset of molecules. The first fullerene molecule to be discovered, and the family's namesake, buckminsterfullerene (C60), was prepared in 1985 by Richard Smalley, Robert Curl, James Heath, Sean O'Brien, and Harold Kroto at Rice University.Kroto, H.W.; et al. (1985). \\"C60: Buckminsterfullerene\\". Nature 318 (6042): 162‚Äì163. . A fullerene is any molecule composed entirely of carbon, in the form of a hollow sphere, ellipsoid, tube, and many other shapes. Spherical fullerenes are also called buckyballs, and they resemble the balls used in football (soccer). Fullerenes are similar in structure to graphite, which is composed of stacked graphene sheets of linked hexagonal rings; but they may also contain pentagonal (or sometimes heptagonal) rings. Azafullerenes were first discovered in 1993 and reported in the California State Science Fair.D.J. Harris, Discovery of Nitroballs: Research in Fullerene Chemistry, 1993 California State Science Fair, http://cssf.usc.edu/History/1993/S05.html The derivatives were formed in the gap between two graphite rods connected to an electric power supply. A small air leak led to contamination of the inert atmosphere and the subsequent reaction. The materials can also be formed by chemical reactions on fullerene or laser ablation of graphitic materials. Subsequent work revealed a wide range of carbon nitride structures.Hummelen et al, Isolation of the Heterofullerene C59N as Its Dimer (C59N)2, Science 269: 1554-1556 (1995)Averdung, J.; Luftmann, H.; Schlachter, I.; Mattay, J.

The nitrogen atoms substitute for carbon atoms on the cage-like molecules. Much of the work has been theoretical in nature. The C48N12 molecule was calculated to be an insulator, with the eight all-carbon rings forming regions of extended electron delocalization.

The actor was cast in the role after being persuaded to attend the audition by his agent. He began filming his first scenes in early February 2013. Bonner's character and his family were created and introduced to Neighbours, as part of an ongoing overhaul of the show's cast and renewed focus on family units within the show. He made his first screen appearance during \\"Episode 6646\\", which was first broadcast on 20 May 2013. Bonner left Neighbours to pursue new acting opportunities, and Josh was killed off during the episode broadcast on 5 April 2016. Josh is portrayed as being driven, \\"self-motivated\\", charismatic and having \\"a real fight in him\\". Bonner thought viewers would empathise with his character and relate to his \\"inner conflict.\\" Josh gets on well with his parents and shares a love- hate relationship with his twin sister Imogen (Ariel Kaplan). Josh's storylines have often revolved around his swimming career and his on-off relationship with Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow). Josh's competitive swimming career later ended when he suffered a shoulder injury as a result of an abseiling accident. He also embarked on a casual relationship with his older neighbour Naomi Canning (Morgana O'Reilly) and was part of a storyline focusing on the consequences of a coward punch he inflicted on Chris Pappas (James Mason), which earned the TV Week Soap Extra Award for Most Topical Storyline of 2015. Creation and casting On 7 February 2013, it was announced that the four-strong Willis family would be introduced to Neighbours, as part of an ongoing overhaul of the show's cast and renewed focus on family units. News of the Willis family's introduction came shortly after producers decided to also bring in the five-strong Turner family. Executive producer Richard Jasek commented \\"As viewers will find out shortly, the Turners are a family of secrets, and the unique backstory of the Willis family is just as compelling.\\" The character of Brad Willis (Kip Gamblin) was reintroduced to the show, along with his wife Terese (Rebekah Elmaloglou) and teenage twins Imogen (Ariel Kaplan) and Joshua. Actor Harley Bonner was cast as Imogen's twin brother Joshua. His casting was confirmed on 18 February. Bonner's mother, Carla, previously appeared in Neighbours as Stephanie Scully. Bonner explained that he received a call from his agent who told him about the role and asked him to audition for it. Bonner admitted to being hesitant about auditioning, as he was aware that it might look like he was following in his mother's footsteps, while he wanted to be seen as his own person. His agent convinced him to pursue the role and he was then shortlisted for the part. Bonner acted out a scene with the casting director, but did not think he had done a good enough job, until he was offered the role. Bonner said it had been a \\"smooth process\\", adding that he was \\"super excited\\" about being cast. He and the other actors began filming their first scenes two weeks after the family's casting announcement. Bonner made his first screen appearance as Josh on 20 May 2013. Development =Characterisation= Before his introduction, Bonner described Josh as being driven, having set goals and not liking things that get in his way. Bonner told Thomas Mitchell from TV Week that people who are \\"super driven\\" would relate to Josh. He explained that Josh has \\"a real fight in him\\" and he strives for what he believes in. Bonner added that while Josh does tend to have a one-track mind, he thought viewers would empathise with him and relate to his \\"inner conflict.\\" A writer for the show's official website agreed with Bonner's assessment of the character, calling Josh \\"highly self-motivated\\" and \\"a natural born competitor\\". The writer pointed out that Josh inherited his charisma from his father and his drive from his mother. Bonner said Josh got on well with his parents and called the Willises \\"a great family unit\\". He added \\"We've clicked really well as actors as well as characters. It was funny when we first met, as the family dynamic of the Willises was quite similar to the way we were in person.\\" Bonner stated that Josh and Imogen have \\"a sort of love-hate relationship\\". Josh loves his sister, but he does not like it when she tells him how to do things. In May 2014, Josh was diagnosed with alcohol intolerance after collapsing during his 18th birthday party. Bonner said Josh was feeling excited ahead of the party, explaining \\"I guess it's a rite of passage for him, and he sees it as a chance to spread his wings.\\" While Josh was playing around, he suddenly collapsed and his family assumed that he had drunk too much alcohol. However, after undergoing some tests, Josh was given his diagnosis. Bonner said Josh was disappointed, but instead of feeling sorry for himself, he decided to take some inspiration from his grandfather, Doug (Terence Donovan), and focus on his future. The following year, Bonner admitted that he would probably be friends with Josh in real life. He pointed out that Josh had no friends within the show and he liked to support the underdog. Bonner said there would be some big drama coming up for Josh and he hoped he would make friends with someone he could have light hearted conversations with. =Swimming career= Following his arrival, it was established that Josh was an elite swimmer training for the 2014 Commonwealth Games. His father was his coach and Gamblin said Josh was \\"sort of\\" Brad's prot√©g√©. Bonner admitted that he had to overcome his fear of deep water to film Josh's training scenes in a real-life Olympic pool. Bonner explained that he did not like going underwater or getting his head wet, so he initially did not swim too far away from the side of the pool. Bonner eventually overcame his fears to become a confident swimmer. Hudson Walsh (Remy Hii) was later introduced to the show as a love interest for another character and a rival for Josh. Hii told Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly that Hudson and Josh would clash, as they were both elite sportspeople trying to win the same medal. Hii continued, \\"However, I guess the difference with them is they know what each other is going through, which helps them understand each other.\\" Hii did not think Hudson was as competitive as Josh, but believed he was more confident because he had a natural ability. When Josh became frustrated with his father's coaching methods, he asked a rival coach, Don Cotter (John Adam), for advice. Don invited Josh to join his squad and Josh agreed, devastating Brad. A few weeks later, Josh learned that Don was forcing Hudson to take performance-enhancing drugs, while holding Josh back. Josh decided to sack Don as his coach and resumed training with Brad. In January 2014, Brad resigned as Josh's coach after becoming fed up of Josh's lack of focus. Josh allowed himself to be distracted when his public profile started to grow. Instead of spending his time training, he started focusing on fame. When Josh refused to take responsibility for his poor performance in the pool, Brad lost patience and fired his son a week before the selection trials for the Commonwealth Games began. =Relationship with Amber Turner= Following Josh's arrival, promotional pictures of him with Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow) were released. When asked if a romance would develop between the two characters, Bonner said \\"Hmmm, there's not a lot I can say now but there is a bit of a connection, but I'm not sure where it will go!\\" Amber immediately developed a crush on Josh, but he kept missing her \\"subtle attempts at flirtation\\". Amber resorted to following Josh to the local pool to watch him train, but he was too busy to notice her. Amber later told Josh that she had been watching him, but he did not seem to mind. When an embarrassed Amber asked then him out on a date, Josh had to turn her down as he had a meeting with the school principal. Amber jumped to the conclusion that she had messed things up and assumed Josh was not romantically interested in her. Josh and Amber eventually grew close when she helped him with his homework and after sharing a kiss, they began dating. The couple later broke up and when Amber saw Josh chatting to another girl at a party, she decided to get even. After being introduced to Clay Blair (Charlie Terrier), Amber kissed him. At the same time, Josh was looking for Amber and Rosenow explained \\"Josh was trying to get away from the girl. When he finally does, he goes to find Amber.\\" Josh eventually found Amber and witnessed the kiss, leaving him devastated. While Amber was unaware that Josh had seen her with Clay, Imogen did and found herself stuck in the middle of her best friend and brother. Rosenow commented that Imogen was all too aware that Josh did not have a good track record and she did not want Amber to get hurt. Amber later agreed to go on a date with Clay, leaving Josh convinced that they would not get back together. After Amber admitted to having sex with her ex-boyfriend, she and Josh struggled to get things back to normal. They were then banned from seeing each other by their respective parents, who believed they were spending too much time together. Realising that they needed to fix their relationship, Amber and Josh began sneaking around. They were soon caught by neighbour Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) who told their parents. Susan also revealed that Josh was in danger of failing the school year, causing Josh to make \\"a strong stand for independence\\" by quitting school and making Amber and his training his priorities. Amber and Josh were divided by their different hopes for their relationship, especially when Josh thought they were ready to have sex. He was then surprised when Amber asked him to wait at least six months before they had sex. A Soap World columnist questioned whether a \\"lovestruck and sex-starved\\" Josh could stay celibate. While Bonner did not think Josh and Amber made a good couple, he believed they genuinely loved each other. Josh broke up with Amber following an argument over her new job. Josh struggled to deal with the break up, but he was soon distracted when local journalist Ruby Knox (Maggie Naouri) came to interview him. Ruby made it clear that she was interested in Josh and they shared a kiss. Bonner explained that Josh was scared by Ruby's strong advances towards him, but he was flattered as she was older than him. The actor believed the kiss was nothing more than a rebound thing and that Josh did want anything more to happen. Bonner admitted that he thought there was a real connection between Josh and Ruby, but realised that she was just using his character to get a story. He said Ruby kissed Josh to get him close and Bonner branded her \\"a tactical journalist.\\" Despite not being in a relationship at the time, Josh felt guilty about the kiss and chose not to tell Amber when they got back together. He assured Amber that she was the one for him and they finally consummated their relationship. =Abseiling accident= In early February 2014, Josh suffered a serious shoulder injury that ended his swimming career. Prior to the accident, Josh and Amber had planned a romantic camping trip, but realising that neither of them could drive, they were forced to invite Imogen and Mason Turner (Taylor Glockner) along. Josh was not happy with Mason coming as they were not friends and Josh thought Imogen could do better than Mason. The rivalry between Josh and Mason came to a head when Mason challenged Josh to go abseiling. Bonner told Inside Soap's Sarah Ellis that with Josh's competitive nature, he was not going to let Mason get the upper hand and agreed to do it. However, just as Josh started his descent, a carabiner clip broke and Josh fell to the ground. Josh was rushed to hospital, where he learned that while his life was not in danger, he had suffered a serious shoulder injury. Bonner said \\"Josh bangs up his shoulder pretty badly, which is the worst thing that could happen for a swimmer.\\" Josh underwent surgery on his shoulder and Bonner explained that from a medical perspective the surgery went well, but in terms of his career, it was a \\"disaster\\". Josh was devastated when he was told that he would not be able to swim competitively again. Needing someone to blame, Josh and his family pointed the finger at Mason and war was declared between the Turner and Willis families. Not prepared to give up on his swimming career, Josh went to the gym to build up his strength. Bonner pointed out that Josh was a strong person mentally, who overcame hurdles before, so he believed this was just another one. When Josh experienced a \\"searing pain\\" during training, he was forced to face the fact that his body was not capable of doing what it used to do. Bonner stated that was the moment that Josh became desperate, saying \\"His mental state isn't where it should be.\\" Determined to carry on with his training, Josh decided to accept some strong painkillers from a drug user at the gym. Bonner explained that Josh told himself the painkillers were harmless and okay for him to use. However, he knew it was not right, but it was easier to talk himself into taking them. =Casual relationship with Naomi Canning= In July 2014, Susan Hill from the Daily Star reported that Josh would begin a casual relationship with his older neighbour Naomi Canning (Morgana O'Reilly) following his break- up with Amber. Bonner explained that when Josh moves some boxes to the hotel for Naomi, they flirt and Josh hinted that they should go to a hotel room, but Naomi rejected his offer. However, while they were in an elevator together, Naomi hit the emergency stop button and they had sex. Bonner commented that the hook-up was good for Josh, saying \\"after everything Josh went through with Amber, it's a realistic avenue for him to explore.\\" Due to the large age gap between them, Josh and Naomi decided to keep their casual relationship a secret. The relationship was almost discovered by Sheila when she returned home unexpectedly and interrupted Naomi and Josh. Naomi forced Josh to hide outside in the garden wearing nothing. Naomi ended the relationship after Terese found out about it and confronted her. =Coward punch= In September 2014, Neighbours launched a storyline focusing on the consequences of a coward punch. During Kyle and Georgia's joint bucks and hen night, Chris was forced to eject a drunk Josh from The Waterhole when he started causing a scene. Shortly after, Josh returned and hit Chris with a coward punch, causing him to fall and hit his head. Mason commented that the storyline was a topical issue in Australia at the time and the moral of it would be \\"that one little mistake can have really dire consequences.\\" Mason thought that Chris might be able to forgive Josh in the future, but it would be \\"a long process\\", and he would have to deal with the fact that his life has changed forever due to the attack. Mason also thought that Chris would have difficulties accepting that someone like Josh attacked him. A guilt-ridden Josh attempted to make up for attacking Chris by helping out at the garage where he worked. Josh realised that Chris had been struggling, so he decided to work there in secret. Josh's good deed ended when he got crushed between two cars and ended up in hospital with minor injuries. Josh tried to keep the incident a secret from Chris, but he soon found out and offered Josh no sympathy. Bonner explained, \\"Chris feels like he's being made to feel guilty because Josh hurt himself while trying to make it up to him.\\" Bonner praised the storyline for raising awareness of how a \\"stupid\\" split-second decision could change the lives of so many people. =Exotic dancing= In an effort to earn money for an operation for his sick daughter, Josh teamed up with Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson) to form an exotic dance duo called The Heat. Bonner and Wilson attended classes at the Ministry of Dance and took lessons with a choreographer for the dance numbers. Bonner admitted that he was nervous, but once the cameras began rolling, he was not bothered. Bonner said Josh was \\"terrified\\" when the Heat received their first booking, a 50th birthday party. Aaron and Josh put together a routine on the day and although it started off \\"a bit rough\\", the female audience enjoyed it. After performing the \\"raunchy\\" routine, Josh was packing up their gear when Sue Parker (Kate Gorman) propositioned him. Bonner stated, \\"He doesn't know what she means to start with, but then he realises she wants some sexy time with him!\\" Sue asked Josh to spend the night with her in return for money. Bonner added that Josh considered the proposal as he was willing to try anything to help his sick daughter. =Departure= When Bonner chose to leave Neighbours to pursue new acting opportunities, the decision was taken to kill Josh off during the \\"Hotel Death Trap\\" storyline on 5 April 2016. When the boiler room at Lassiter's Hotel exploded, Josh and Daniel were both injured by a fallen column. Josh sacrificed himself to save Daniel. His family gathered to say their goodbyes, while he also spoke to Amber and Matilda via video call, with Rosenow reprising her role as Amber for the scenes. Josh later appeared to Imogen in her dreams. Storylines Josh moves onto Ramsay Street with his family, after his mother gets a job at the local hotel. During swim practice, Josh is given some advice by another coach Don Cotter. While Brad rejects Don's advice, Josh later makes the decision to hire Don as his coach. Josh struggles to keep up with his school work and Amber Turner offers to help. She later tells him that she did not understand the subject, but wanted to impress him. Josh kisses her and they begin dating. When Josh turns up late to training, Don offers him an ultimatum ‚Äì Amber or swimming. Josh chooses swimming, but does not break up with Amber and tells Don she is stalking him when he catches them together. When Amber realises what Josh said, she breaks up with him. Don switches Josh to middle-distance swimming, so there is less competition for his rival Hudson Walsh. Josh later realises Don has been under timing him and fires him. Josh attempts to reunite with Amber, but he sees her kissing someone else. Brad starts coaching Hudson and Josh is initially hostile towards him. Josh learns Amber's ex-boyfriend, Robbo Slade (Aaron Jakubenko), is using footage of her having sex with him to blackmail her brother Mason. Josh, Mason, Hudson and Chris Pappas (James Mason) arrange to pay Robbo. Josh confronts Robbo on his own and is punched. When Robbo dies after being involved in a hit-and-run, Josh is briefly considered a suspect, until Hudson confesses. Josh and Amber get back together, and he quits school to focus on his swimming. Josh and Amber break up twice due to his failure to take her ambition to be a photographer seriously and his kiss with journalist Ruby Knox. Josh wins a local emerging talent award and his public profile increases. He begins missing training sessions and is rude to his father. Terese eventually manages to convince him to return to serious training. Josh qualifies for the Commonwealth Games, but his competitive swimming career ends when he injures his shoulder in an abseiling accident. Josh buys painkillers from a drug dealer and Amber tells his parents, causing Josh to break up with her. Imogen persuades the couple to get back together. Josh returns to school and has to repeat a year. At his joint eighteenth birthday party, Josh collapses after he drinks a glass of champagne and learns he is alcohol intolerant. Dejected by this, he is inspired by Daniel Robinson (Tim Phillipps) to take up skateboarding. Josh becomes jealous when Daniel says that he and Amber share a spiritual 'vibe', but both insist it is not physical. Josh flirts with newcomer Paige Novak (Olympia Valance). Josh is fined by the police after Jayden Warley (Khan Oxenham) injures himself copying one of his skateboarding stunts. Jayden's mother, Sue Parker (Kate Gorman) threatens to sue Josh, but Daniel talks her out of it. Josh discovers Amber has been having an affair with Daniel and he ends their relationship. After quitting school for a second time, Josh becomes the manager of the local gym. Josh and Imogen learn Paige is their half-sister. Josh is more accepting of the news, until he learns that she knew about Amber's feelings for Daniel. Josh embarks on a casual relationship with Naomi Canning. Josh gets drunk at Kyle and Georgia's engagement party and punches Chris, causing him serious injury. Feeling guilty, Josh sells his swimming trophies to pay for Chris's rehabilitation and he leaves food parcels for him. He also gives a talk at the community centre about the consequences of his actions. Josh helps at the garage to save Chris's job, which leads to an accident where he is crushed between two cars. Josh is given 300 hours of community service and a two-year suspended sentence for hitting Chris. Josh admits that he still loves Amber and vows to win her back, but she reunites with Daniel. Josh comforts Amber when Daniel fails to turn up for their wedding, and they have sex. Josh finds out Amber is pregnant, but Paige assures him that the baby is Daniel's. Josh befriends Danni Ferguson (Laura McIntosh), the woman who killed Amber's father, and they later share a kiss and continue to meet until Danni breaks off contact. Amber tells Josh that he could be the father of her baby and he uses the information to try to get closer to her. Amber becomes stressed and leaves Erinsborough, but Daniel and Josh track her down. She asks them to leave after an argument breaks out. She later collapses from the stress. A paternity test reveals that Josh is the baby's father. Josh is hired by Forrest Jones (Nicholas Gunn) to sell nutritional supplements. Imogen suspects Josh's new job is a pyramid scheme and gets him fired, but Forrest gives Josh his job back. Amber and Josh learn their baby has congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and a 50% chance of survival. They decide to go to the United States for further treatment, despite opposition from their families. Josh begins selling illegal peptides, but is fired when Imogen threatens to expose Forrest. Amber asks Josh to give her some space, but he contacts her through an online forum, pretending to be a young mother named Phoebe. Josh befriends Aaron Brennan and they form an exotic dance duo called The Heat. Following a performance at a birthday party, Josh is approached by Sue Parker, who offers him money to spend the night with her. Josh and Amber learn that they are expecting a daughter and that her CDH is mild. Aaron encourages Josh to come clean about Phoebe, but Amber discovers the truth before he can. She tells him that from now on, he can only be there for the baby. Josh has a relationship with barmaid Courtney Grixti (Emma Lane), which ends when he asks if he can move in with her during his parents' separation. He then has an affair with Naomi, who is having doubts about her engagement to Paul. When Paul finds out, he appears to forgive them both. After the police received an anonymous tip off, they search Josh's bag and arrest him for possessing illegal peptides. The charges are dropped when CCTV footage shows the peptides were planted in his bag. Josh later learns that Paul set him up in revenge for his affair with Naomi. Imogen gives Josh a USB flash drive that contains Paul's encrypted files and he teams up with Nate Kinski (Meyne Wyatt) to open them. Josh learns that the council are closing the high school and he tells Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne). Amber goes into premature labour and is rushed to hospital, where Josh is waiting. She gives birth to their daughter, who is quickly admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Josh and Amber name their daughter Matilda (Eloise Simbert), and she undergoes a successful operation. Shortly after bringing Matilda home, Josh almost rolls on her when he falls asleep. When Josh admits that he is overwhelmed, Amber tells him that he should not be alone with Matilda. Josh learns Amber is planning to move to Queensland with Matilda and tries to stop her, before deciding to join them. However, when Josh kisses Amber, she believes he is still suffering from post- natal depression and asks him to stay in Erinsborough. In the wake of Amber's departure, Josh makes himself sick with excessive exercise. He later admits he has not been feeling a paternal connection with Matilda, and decides to stay away from her until he is ready to be a father. Josh helps Brad train Brodie Chaswick (Matt Testro), and is infuriated to discover Piper and Brodie have a secret relationship. Josh decides to move to Brisbane to be closer to Matilda. However, Josh is caught up in the boiler room explosion at Lassiter's Hotel and pinned under a fallen column. Daniel is trapped by the same column, but Karl explains that if they move it to save Daniel, Josh will die. Josh sacrifices himself for Daniel, and after saying goodbye to his family and Matilda, Josh dies. Reception In 2014, Bonner won the Soap Extra Award for Most Topical Storyline for his character Josh's coward punch storyline with Chris Pappas. Peter Dyke and Katie Begley from the Daily Star cited Bonner and his character as one of the reasons extra female viewers were tuning into Neighbours.

His endless whining isn't attractive. I like that even Brad told him to shut up and focus on his swimming.\\" Langford thought it was a shame that Josh was not gay too, as it would have made for a love triangle storyline, believing Josh and Hudson's fighting hid \\"an underlying attraction.\\" In April 2014, Langford checked on Josh and found things had not changed, saying he was \\"still annoying and his romance with Amber is still chemistry free and boring.\\" Stephen Downie liked Josh's relationship with Naomi, commenting, \\"The romance between Josh and Naomi has a use-by date but, much like the couple, we're willing to enjoy this ride while it lasts.\\" Claire Crick from All About Soap praised the pairing and said \\"we love their hilarious secret hook-ups, especially when they end with Josh dashing naked across Ramsay Street!\\" References External links *Josh Willis at the Official AU Neighbours website *Josh Willis at the Official UK Neighbours website Category:Neighbours characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2013 Category:Fictional competitive swimmers Category:Fictional personal trainers Category:Fictional twins Category:Fictional Greek people in television Category:Fictional teenage parents Category:Fictional dancers Category:Willis family Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Josh Willis (Neighbours)"},{"id":"42374187","title":"List of Vietnamese films of 2014"},{"id":"42374268","text":"Chinese button knot is essentially a knife lanyard knot where the lanyard loop is shortened to a minimum, i.e. tightened to the knot itself.

Tying  The basic chinese button knot (ABOK #599 on one string) is usually tied with a carrick bend that attaches the two ends as a first step.

The company provides medical and dental insurance in Oregon and Alaska (and in Washington state before 2016). The Moda Center, a sports arena that is home to the Portland Trail Blazers; and Moda Tower, the tenth- tallest building in Portland; are both named after the company. Moda Health is a member of Delta Dental. History Originally started as part of the Oregon Dental Society (now the Oregon Dental Association), the company began as a dental insurance plan. In 1995, the Oregon Department of Justice investigated claims of anti-trust issues related to a most favored nation clause in its contracts with dentists, which led to the removal of the clause. The company announced in 1996 it would move to what became the ODS Tower. In July 1999, ODS moved into the new office building, and the next month sold its former headquarters for $9.6 million to the retirement trusts for Les Schwab Tires and law firm Stoel Rives. ODS changed its name to Moda Health in May 2013, though it kept the ODS moniker for its dental plans in Oregon. Later that year it announced a sponsorship deal with the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers, in which the former Rose Garden Arena would be renamed as the Moda Center. The company is also the shirt sponsor of National Women's Soccer League side Seattle Reign. As of 2013, the company had nearly 1,400 employees and $1.7 billion in annual revenues. =ACA's Risk corridor program= The risk corridors program under the PPACA section 1342, was a temporary risk management device, modeled on similar successful risk corridors in Medicare Part D, to encourage reluctant insurers into the \\"new and untested\\" ACA insurance market during the first three years that ACA was implemented (2014-2016). While the program did succeed in attracting insurers, it did not pay for itself and suffered billions of dollars of losses and funds were to be paid from \\"general government revenues\\". Congressional Republicans \\"railed against\\" the program as a 'bailout' for insurers. and in 2014, then-Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), on the Appropriations Committee that funded the HHS \\"[slipped] in a sentence\\" ‚Äî Section 227 ‚Äî in the \\"massive\\" spending bill that said that no funds in the discretionary spending bill \\"could be used for risk- corridor payments.\\" This effectively \\"blocked the administration from obtaining the necessary funds from other programs.\\" Moda, and a number of other insurers, suffered financially. As a result, in January 2016, regulators in Oregon and Alaska temporarily suspended the ability of Moda Health to sell insurance after large financial losses left it with a lack of capital. The restrictions were lifted in February 2016 after the parent company agreed to raise additional funds. Moda Health Plan, Inc. v. The United States Moda Health took the case to court and won a \\"$214-million judgment against the federal government\\". On February 10, 2017 Judge Thomas C. Wheeler stated, \\"the Government \\"made a promise in the risk corridors program that it has yet to fulfill. Today, the court directs the Government to fulfill that promise. After all, 'to say to [Moda], 'The joke is on you. You shouldn't have trusted us,' is hardly worthy of our great government.\\" On June 14, 2018 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Court overturned the lower court ruling, reversing the $214 million judgment.

Inocencio Herrera - a native of Pateros, Rizal, he grew up in the Bicol Region and enrolled in the seminary of Nueva Caceres (now Naga City). He was a brilliant young man and had always topped his class. Gifted with a good voice, he became the choir master of the Metropolitan Cathedral of Nueva Caceres. He was only 30 years old when the Spaniards executed him. * Rev. Gabriel Prieto - He demonstrated unusual wit and intelligence. He was a consistent scholar at the seminary of Nueva Caceres, where he studied for the priesthood. After his ordination, he was appointed by Msgr. Herrera as his adviser and confidential secretary. Father Prieto was denounced by the Spanish friars for his liberal and independent ideas. * Rev. Severino Diaz - He was born in Bulan, Sorsogon of poor but hardworking parents. He was a model student at the seminary and later as parish priest of Nueva Caceres. He attended to his flock with extraordinary zeal. People remember him as the man who rebuilt and improved the Naga Cathedral. The Spanish friars were jealous of him for becoming the first Filipino Cura Paroco of Nueva Caceres. He was 45 years old when he was executed at the Luneta. * Manuel Abella - A native of Catanauan, Quezon, he was better known for his philanthropic activities among the poor and underprivileged. He was 60 years old when he faced the firing squad in Bagumbayan. * Domingo Abella - A son of Manuel Abella. Frank and outspoken, he took every opportunity to denounce the abuses and arrogance of the Spaniards. He was only 25 when he was executed at the Luneta. * Camilo Jacob - A commercial photographer and native of Polangui, Albay. Like Domingo Abella, he was open-hearted. Suspected of conniving with the revolutionists, Jacob was tortured and starved to death in prison. * Tomas Prieto - A brother of Rev. Gabriel Prieto. A pharmacist, he was popular with the common people for his liberal and progressive ideas. He was executed at the age of 30. * Florendo Lerma - A theater owner and playwright from Quiapo, Manila, he went to Bicol at the age of 15 and established the first movie house in Naga. * Macario Valentin - He was chief of the night patrol in Naga. He took advantage of his position by siding with the revolutionists, whom he supplied with valuable information about the activities of the Spanish militia. * Mariano Melgarejo - A native son of Naga. In his diary, he wrote: \\"I look forward to the day when Filipinas takes her place among the free nations of the world.\\" * Cornelio Mercado - An employee in the public works department of Nueva Caceres. The four Bicolano freedom fighters who were either exiled or died in prison were: * Leon Hernandez - A resident of Libmanan, Camarines Sur, who was well-to-do and highly influential. He was thrown into the municipal jail in Nueva Caceres, where he was tortured to death for denying participation in the revolutionary movement. * Ramon Abella - Also a son of Manuel Abella, who was executed at the Luneta. He was a strong advocate of the progressive and independent aspiration of his father. * Mariano Arana - A government surveyor who died in exile on Bioko Island (then Fernando Po). * Mariano Ordenanza - A clerk in the Bureau of Public Works. He died in jail in Manila shortly after he was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment by the Spanish Council of War. Legacy While the heroic deeds and martyrdom of secular priests Mariano Gomez, Jose Burgos and Jacinto Zamora are known all over the land and familiar to history students, the memory of the 15 martyrs of Bicolandia is confined to Naga City, the heart of Bicol. For more than 70 years, the people of Naga City and nearby municipalities have been paying tribute to these martyrs every fourth day of January. During the incumbency of the late Camarines Sur Gov. Julian Ocampo, a monument was erected in Naga City in memory of the Quince Martires del Bicolandia. The monument, located in the heart of the city, was formally dedicated on November 30, 1923. Official recognition of the 15 martyrs of Bicolandia came only on February 20, 1950 when the director of the Department of Education added to the list of significant dates in Philippine history January 4, 1897, the day when Filipino freedom fighters from the Bicol region were executed.

Beyond Lakewood, the tracks are owned by CSAO as far as Lakehurst, but are inactive between Lakewood and Lakehurst.

The line hosted the CNJ's famous passenger train the Blue Comet from 1929 to 1941. The line prospered into the 1940s when, like all American rail lines and the railroads that owned them, it entered a period of decline. In 1957, the last scheduled passenger service ended on the line, leaving it as a freight-only line. Despite the sand traffic that frequented the line, the number of general freights (not including sand and local freights to serve the industries along the line) dwindled to two, JS-1 and SJ-2 as the northeastern rail scene became more grim. In 1976, Conrail took over all operations, and in 1978, it severed the line between Woodmansie and Winslow Junction, ending its use as a through route linking South and North Jersey. Within the next decade, operations would be cut back again to Lakehurst. =Conrail Shared Assets Operations (1999-present)= From June, 1 1999, the line has been operated by CSAO, and despite the recovering railroad state in this time frame, the line's customer base continued to dwindle, and in 2010, the line was cut back further to Lakewood. The line also included the Toms River Industrial Track (Lakehurst to Toms River), but it was placed out of service after all of the customers discontinued rail service. =Current operations= The WPSA-31, the weekly freight that serves the customers, runs down the line every Thursday. The last four customers on the line are: *Woodhaven Lumber - the largest customer on the line, they receive cars every week. *Extech Building Materials - Extech receives boxcars of Building Materials, but not every week. They didn‚Äôt receive cars in 2018, but started receiving cars again in 2019. *Brick Recycling - Receives gondola cars for loading with scrap metal. * Bel-Ray Co, Inc. - Receives tank cars of ethanol/ethyl alcohol. The tank cars are spotted on the Brick Recycling siding. The return job, the WPSA-38, switches out with the SA-31 crew to bring the empties from Woodhaven back to Browns Yard in Sayreville, as well as to drill Brick Recycling and Bel-Ray, Co. along the way.

The project started with an Indiegogo campaign in February 2014, which ended in a success. The game was released on December 6, 2017 for Steam's early access. The director of the game and previously an editor and cinematographer at Valve, Leonard Menchiari, has experienced riots personally and the game \\"Riot\\" was created as a way to express it and to tell the stories of these events. The player can pick between playing as police or rioters.http://www.riotgame.org/ The game will potentially be released on Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android. The producers are interested in bringing the game to these platforms, but are currently restricted by their budget.http://www.riotgame.org/FAQ/ Gameplay RIOT allows the player to play as both the police and rioting groups. As the police, the game revolves around strategy and planning, with a GUI that adopts a traditional police style. This contrasts the typical gameplay of the rioting group, which is adaptive and responsive, relying on the decisions the police make as opposed to long-term planning, instead relying on fast decision making skills.http://www.riotgame.org/blog/?p=17#more-17 The game includes six main campaigns set in Italy, Greece, Spain and Egypt. Other riots set across the world will be available as well as an unlockable. Each scenario will have different backgrounds as well as props and police uniforms. activists‚Äô clothing will be procedurally generated. Characters will have different stats that change the way they react in different situations, This means people will act in unpredictable ways based on the elements that will happen in each riot.http://www.riotgame.org/blog/?p=470#more-470 RIOT is planning to release an in-game level editor, using this players will be able to re-create the riots that are currently going on in the world. The levels can then be shared with anyone in the world, and can then be rated by others based on quality and historical accuracy. Development The scenarios in Riot were partly informed through designer Leonard Menchiari's participation in the Italian No TAV protests. Riot was part funded through an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, raising $36,139 in March 2013. Some of the game's budget was for travel and research. The game aims to depict scenarios in a neutral manner, allowing the player to explore both sides of the conflict. Riot emulates a 2D retro look even though the scene is 3D, which gives more realistic lighting, physics, and visual effects. All character movements are physics based. This means that rather than following just a path, the crowd movement will be influenced by the physical contact given by the rest of the crowd. The art style is inspired by Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP.

They are not custom tailored according to measurements, but rather generalized according to anthropometric studies. They are made from many different fabrics and yarns. Their characteristics depend on the fibers used in their manufacture. Ready- made garments are divided into the following types: outer clothing, which includes workwear and uniforms, leisure wear, and sportswear (e.g., suits, pants, dresses, ladies' suits, blouses, blazers, jackets, cardigans, sweaters, coats, sports jackets, skirts, shirts, ties, jeans, shorts, T-shirts, polo shirts, sports shirts, tracksuits, bathing shorts, bathing suits, and bikinis); and undergarments, which include jersey goods and lingerie (e.g. underpants, undershirts, briefs, socks, stockings, and pantyhose). History The first ready-made garment factory was established in New York in 1831. During the American Civil War the need for ready-made uniforms helped the garment sector grow in the United States. Near the end of the nineteenth century there were changes in societal views towards ready-made garments: They were no longer seen as only for the lower classes but also for the middle classes. This trend started in the United States. In the beginning they were more popular with men than women. In the late 1860s, twenty-five percent of garments produced in the US were ready-made, but by 1890, the portion had risen to sixty percent. By 1951, ninety percent of garments sold in the United States were ready made. During the same time two-thirds of garments sold in France were ready made.

Given the shortage of regular troops, Ribas had to arm a thousand students from colleges and seminaries in the city and other neighboring towns, including 85 students of the Seminary of Santa Rosa de Lima, Caracas. Before going into battle, General Ribas addressed the youths who accompanied him, ending with these words: The battle began at seven in the morning and lasted all day on the streets of the city. Republican troops built an impressive resistance to push the royalist troops at that time led by Francisco Tom√°s Morales. By late afternoon, victory had not yet gone to either side.

There are going to be four major topics that surround the issues of the rules and regulations regarding shale gas. Safeguards and loopholes, environmental assessments, monitoring and mitigating, and Canadian deregulation and international governance. These four issues will be the main focus of the article  Safeguards and loopholes  Environmental assessments  Monitoring and mitigating Monitoring and mitigating of shale gas is referring to making sure that there is no potential danger to the environment. There are several problems that can occur when focusing on shale gas (fracking). Air, land and water resource are usually the main issues when it comes to fracking and Shale Gas. =Air= NETL (National Energy Technology Laboratory) will monitor ambient air quality at the Washington County site using a mobile air quality monitoring laboratory. NETL also will conduct targeted on-site measurements of air emissions during well development and production activities and use collected data in atmospheric chemistry and transport models to further understanding of local and regional air quality impacts. Completed - Almost eight months of pre-development air quality data were acquired at this location before the air monitoring laboratory was moved to the Greene County site in March 2012. Planned - The mobile air quality monitoring laboratory will return to the Washington County site when construction at the location commences (timing depends on industry partner). =Land= The Australian Greens stand firmly on the side of Australian farmers. We want farmers to have a right to refuse access to mining and gas companies on their land. Currently, under state, territory and federal laws, most landholders have no right to refuse mining and gas companies access to explore and then later, mine or frack their land. The Greens are the only party to realise that supporting our farmers and protecting our prime agricultural land and water is vital for our future food security. =Water resources= Monitoring ground water is a major concern, there are many individuals that are clamming that their water is being contaminated from chemicals that are coming from hydraulic fracturing. A frequently expressed concern about shale gas development is that subsurface hydraulic fracturing operations in deep shale formations might create fractures that extend well beyond the target formation to water aquifers, allowing methane, contaminants naturally occurring in formation water, and fracturing fluids to migrate from the target formation into drinking water supplies. Protecting water Regulation of the Canadian oil and gas sector is designed to protect drinking water and water quality in our lakes and streams. The specific regulations vary between jurisdictions but in all cases, Canadian natural gas production always isolates and protects drinking water (groundwater) from natural gas operations. In Alberta for example, regulation requires that natural gas development provide an extensive barrier (both vertically and laterally) between any shallow stimulation interval and existing water wells, in addition to isolating the aquifer and the fractured zone. Alberta has also increased the focus on water well education and standards in oil and gas producing areas. =Types of monitoring= Phased Environmental Impact Assessments- This is a process which New Brunswick oil, shale gas and natural gas companies are required to register for their projects before taking action. The process will identify potential environmental impacts at the early stages before a project is implemented so that negative environmental impacts can be avoided or reduced to an acceptable level. Phased EIA registration * location of proposed drill targets; * description existing environment within the drill target areas including environmental constraints (wetlands, watercourses, wildlife resources and habitat), location of sensitive areas and additional proposed exploration activities; * details about the construction and operation of the well pads, access roads and associated infrastructure; * details associated with drilling activities; * details regarding waste management; * process and potable water requirements and water sources; * material handling and shipping; * sewage treatment facilities; * Any past, current, or future projects or activities in the project area whose effects may interact with those of the project under review; commercial extraction, pipelines, gas processing or well decommissioning; * and any other applicable details/aspects of the project as the project develops.

In the 1930s California became known nationally for its Regionalist painters like Colburn, who depicted urban and rural views of native life. These artists‚Äô preferred medium was watercolor and they worked quickly outdoors on location developing a painting style that was spontaneous, gestural and raw. While most American Regionalists worked in a realistic manner, Colburn liked to experiment with the lessons of modernism. Like the East Coast modernist John Marin, who was a major influence on the artist, Colburn continually searched for a direct freedom of expression. The San Francisco critic Alfred Frankenstein credited Colburn with a sense of drama and ‚Äúas fine an eye for the subtleties of watercolor as this country has produced since Marin‚Äôs heyday.‚Äù Colburn grew up in Glendale and Long Beach and studied geology at the University of Southern California. After graduating in 1932 he spent a year in Europe traveling and studying art. Upon his return to Los Angeles, he studied with Don Graham at Chouinard Art Institute. In 1937 he moved to Carmel, where he became a member of the Carmel Art Association three years later The Monterey Peninsula provided the perfect cultural climate for the development of Colburn's art. At the time, the prominent artists Armin Hansen, William Ritschel, Paul Whitman, August Gay, and Louis Siegriest were present in the area and provided valuable friendship and advice; the writer John Steinbeck, poet Robinson Jeffers and photographers Edward Weston and Ansel Adams were also close friends.Sam Colburn, interview with the author, Stag's Retreat, Pacific Grove, California, 12 December 1987. Salvador Dal√≠, who lived in Pebble Beach during the 1940s, attracted other important European modernists to the area including Fernand Leger, with whom Colburn studied in 1941. Colburn's portrait of Jeffers is on the cover of the 1963 Vintage paperback edition of Robinson Jeffers: Selected Poems. Sam at work in his Carmel, California home-studio in 1962. For many years, Colburn lived in Carmel, in a large house which was a center for local bohemian activity, playing his violin during late night drinking parties and living mainly off an inheritance, which eventually gave out. Later he lived in a sheltered cabin called Stag's Retreat in the beachside Asilomar woods, across from the last remaining sand dunes in the area. Something of a local legend on the Peninsula for his acerbic wit and eccentric character, Colburn was an active member of the artistic community, teaching, writing art criticism for the Carmel Pine Cone, executing public murals, and exhibiting in galleries and museums throughout California, and in Colorado, New York, and London. Colburn gained his substantial reputation as a watercolorist and for his early paintings of the Monterey Peninsula in Northern California. He depicted the fisherman and activities around the wharf and in the canneries, and the hills and farm buildings around Salinas and Carmel Valley. In Colburn's early landscapes, he is interested in structure and composition, trying to capture the essence of a scene with a Cezannesque interest in reducing volumes to shape and color. His early figural works of Monterey fisherman at work in the sardine canneries made famous by John Steinbeck, reduce the figures to blocky forms in the manner of Diego Rivera.Ibid. Colburn's later nudes, still lifes, and landscapes, made when the artist was in his eighties, are elegant, and entirely loose and expressive. The artist developed a vision of his own through the years, directly transferring his feeling for nature and the moment to the viewer.Ibid.

It was founded in 2012 and launched as a national securities exchange in September 2016. On October 24, 2017, IEX received regulatory approval from the SEC to list companies. IEX listed its first public company, Interactive Brokers, on October 5, 2018. The exchange said that companies would be able to list for free for the first five years, before a flat annual rate of $50,000. On September 23, 2019 it announced it was exiting its listing business.Company press release In September 2019, IEX announced that Co-founder and COO John Schwall would retire from the company by the end of 2019. The genesis and early days of the exchange are chronicled in the 2014 book Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt by Michael Lewis. History =Founding and first trading= Founded in 2012 and started by Brad Katsuyama and Ronan Ryan, it opened for trading on October 25, 2013. The company‚Äôs offices are located at 3 World Trade Center in New York City. The matching engine is located across the Hudson River in Weehawken, New Jersey, and the initial point of presence is located in a data center in Secaucus, New Jersey. IEX's main innovation is a coil of optical fiber placed in front of its trading engine. This 350 microsecond delay adds a round-trip delay of 0.0007 seconds and is designed to negate the certain speed advantages utilized by some high-frequency traders. The exchange's market session runs from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm Eastern Time. =Federal approvals= The SEC approved IEX to be an official exchange on June 17, 2016. > In late 2016, IEX hired Sara Furber to lead its listing effort. A former managing director at Morgan Stanley, she reported to Katsuyama. The company aimed to start listing companies in 2017. After a 13-month wait, on October 24, 2017, IEX Group Inc. received regulatory approval from the SEC to list companies. IEX said it would begin listings in early 2018, with a focus on getting companies to switch over from other stock exchanges, by undercutting listing fees of rivals. The exchange said that companies would be able to list for free for the first five years, before a flat annual rate of $50,000. In comparison, NYSE had annual listing fees as high as $500,000, and Nasdaq up to $155,000. The Wall Street Journal wrote that the approval paved \\"the way for the first competition to the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Inc. in nearly a decade... Companies seeking to list their shares on a U.S. exchange haven‚Äôt had a choice besides NYSE or Nasdaq since 2008, when the American Stock Exchange was acquired by NYSE.\\" Only Wynn Resorts Ltd. said publicly that it was considering a listing on IEX at the time of the approval announcement, with IEX not releasing more details on listings. Exchange features = Operating principles = IEX was created in response to questionable trading practices that had become widely used across traditional public Wall Street exchanges as well as dark pools and other alternative trading systems. The IEX exchange aims to attract investors by promising to \\"play fair\\" by operating in a transparent and straightforward manner, while also helping to level the playing field for traders. Strategies to achieve those goals include: * Publishing the matching rules used in the exchange's computerized order matching engine. * Offering a limited number of simple and familiar order types. * Charging fixed fees on most orders (or a flat percentage rate on small orders). * Ensuring market pricing data arrives at external points of presence simultaneously. * Slightly delaying market pricing data to all customers (no colocation). * Refusing to pay for order flow. These strategies are intended to ensure the trustworthiness of the exchange. A few dark pools are owned by trading companies that pay for certain types of orders to allow them to fill orders within the pool, rather than routing orders to public exchanges. IEX offers no rebates for orders, and only charges a flat fee of $0.0009 per share on trades executed within the dark pool (or 0.30% with shares worth less than $1.00). Trades forwarded to other trading venues are charged a lower rate. IEX has five order types: market, limit, primary peg (pegged to national best bid/offer), midpoint peg and patent-pending discretionary peg. IEX discretionary peg is a primary peg that may execute at up to midpoint price when the quote is stable. A few optional parameters can be attached to the orders, leaving IEX with many fewer order types than most other exchanges. IEX delays the flow of data from the exchange and ensures that it arrives simultaneously at two points of presence in New Jersey. Traders are not allowed to co-locate equipment adjacent to IEX's own servers, unlike many other trading platforms. IEX has its own low-latency links to other trading venues in the New York region, which it can use to execute trades for customers in under 320 microseconds. The point-of-presence links for traders to gain access to IEX have a built-in, round-trip delay of 700 microseconds from a 38-mile coil of fiber, so traders cannot beat IEX's own computers as orders propagate outward. The data delay prevents many predatory behaviors. It deters the practice of liquidity fading, where they peer into various trading venues and try to detect orders as they propagate from a broker's order router, and use this information to withdraw liquidity ahead of toxic order flow. = Market share (in percent) = (Source: IEX) =Broker priority= Before becoming an exchange, IEX operated a dark pool which did not adhere entirely to priority by price then time, unlike other U.S. trading venues. Instead, the IEX prioritized orders by price, followed by broker, and lastly time. Katsuyama argues that this arrangement advantages regular investors contrarily to high frequency trading (HFT) firms, by preventing, for instance, HFT firms from jumping to the top of the order queue and front-running normal investors. When IEX applied for exchange status, it dropped the broker-based priority mechanism, and as an exchange it gives priority to the best price first followed by the time of order submittal (as do other exchanges). =Liquidity= Michael Lewis' book Flash Boys focused on the new trading platform, arguing that it was better than other dark pools since it created an equal playing field for investors by slowing down trading and preventing HFT firms from front running orders. An advocacy group for high-frequency traders countered that liquidity-provider firms need speed and direct market connectivity to manage risk, and a market that limits speed, such as IEX, would be illiquid and expensive for price discovery.  IEX Cloud  IEX also offers an API service, allowing developers to query US and Canadian stock data.

Early years Meng Caicheng was born in Yanting County, Sichuan, China. He passed the Provincial Exam during the reign of Guangxu Emperor, then he was appointed as Director of Mianzhu County Education Department. After several years, he started to work as a professor at Chengdu Governmental Institution and appointed as Supervisor of Gentry Class at the Political-Legal School. He advised students not only to learn specific knowledge but also to be useful to the society. Students were not used to doing gymnastics, so Meng served as an example in the courtyard. He was highly respected and called Mr. Gongfu (literally, Public Father Figure.) Railway protection movement In 1905, Sichuan Province established the Sichuan-Hankou Railway Company. However, the company management was beset by corruption and mismanagement and construction effort made little progress. During August 1910, Sichuan Advisory Department started to run official newspaper \\"Shu Gazette\\" with the propaganda \\"Overseeing Administration and Promoting Institutionalism\\". Meng Caicheng was one of the sponsors of \\"Shu Gazette\\", which published articles about important political events and also disclosed the corruption and degeneration of the official class. The newspaper was forced to stop publication in July 1911. on April 26, 1911, Wang Renwen, the Deputy Governor of Sichuan, presented a memorial to the Bureau of Civil Affairs. In the Memo, Wang reported that \\"the Sichuan-Hankou Railway Company representative stakeholder Meng Caicheng and others ever advised the Department to notify all the official business to government organs and the public. So they were running Sichuan Railway Monthly to publish all important issues about Sichuan Railway such as finance, accounting, construction and operation.\\" On May 9, 1911, the Qing authorities ordered the nationalization of all locally controlled railway signed a local agreement with Great Britain, Germany, France and the United States. The nationalization order drew strong opposition across Southern China, especially Sichuan. Pu Dianjun, Meng Caicheng and other influential members of the Sichuan Provincial Assembly organized the Railway Protection League on June 17, and made public speeches against the plan. On August 2, Zhao Erfeng arrived Chengdu and took the post of the Governor-General of Sichuan. On September 7, Zhao Erfeng had Pu Dianjun, Luo Lun, Yan Kai and other leaders arrested and closed the company. Afterwards, Meng Caicheng asked the Governor Zhao Erfeng to have him arrested as well. As an appointed official by imperial government, Meng Caicheng was prisoned alone at Police Department. Enraged protestors marched on the Governor-General's office. Zhao Erfeng ordered troops to open fire and dozens of protestors were killed. Bloodshed further inflamed the protestors. Led by Tongmenghui, an armed revolution broke out all over Sichuan Province. On October 5, Zhao Erfeng released Meng Caicheng, Hu Rong and other leaders. The Qing Court ordered Duan Fang, the Governor-General of Hubei and Hunan to reinforce Sichuan with troops from Hubei, which weakened defenses in Wuhan. On October 10, 1911, revolutionaries in the New Army units that remained in Wuhan launched the Wuchang Uprising. On November 14, Zhao Erfeng released Pu Dianjun from prison and negotiated established Great Han Military Government of Sichuan. On November 27, Sichuan declared independence from the Qing Dynasty Government. On December 9, 1911, Yin Changheng reorganized Military Government of Sichuan and took up the post of governor. Yin Changheng appointed Meng Caicheng as Magistrate of Ba-An Prefecture to prevent Xizang from declaring independence. After Meng arrived Ba-An, he first established policy to harmonize Han residents and Zang residents. The Zang residents and Han People lived and worked in peace during his administration. Late years In 1913, Meng Caicheng returned to Chengdu and worked as the President of Chengdu Capital High School. In 1921, Meng Caicheng was selected as the President of Chongqing Second Lady's Normal School, wherethere, he employed several important communists such as Xiao Chunu, Zhang Wentian and Yun Daiying, and famous professors, governmental officials such as Meng Wentong, Deng Shaoqin, Li Xiaofang, Tang Tiefeng, Yuan Yunsheng, Lu Zuofu etc. He also supported students to participate in \\"Deyang Wan\\" Protest March and sponsored representative members to attend the First National Representative Assembly of Kuomintang, led by Sun Zhongshan.

A native of Wales, Kato emigrated to the United States in 2007. One of the most recognisable faces of the steampunk community, Kato has been called \\"the supermodel of steampunk\\" and steampunk's \\"it\\" girl. Steampunk comic heroine Lady Mechanika was inspired by her look, and her work has been featured in several books on steampunk art and fashion including International Steampunk Fashions, where her photo is featured prominently on the cover. Kato was also on the cover of the August 2014 issue of Bizarre Magazine, which referred to her as a \\"steampunk idol\\" and \\"pin-up legend\\". She also appeared on the cover of the Spring 2012 issue of FEY Magazine, and also the covers of September 2012 Ladies of Steampunk and April 2013 LoSP Bronze Age (NSFW) magazines. In July 2016 she was on the cover of Phantasm Magazine's steampunk issue, where she was referred to as \\"The Queen of Steam\\". Kato is a frequent guest speaker at steampunk conventions, most recently Wild Wild West Con in Tucson, Arizona and Salt City Steamfest in Salt Lake City, Utah. Background Kato is the third of four daughters born to wildlife painter Terence Lambert and his wife, a school headmistress/principal. She grew up in a Victorian rectory behind a 13th- century cemetery, and credits this for her love of Victorian style. She left school at 16 and finished her final two years at a tech college where she could specialise in fine art. She then went on to complete a course in fashion and textiles at the South West Wales School of Art in Carmarthen. After graduating she launched her first business, called Moshka, where she made and sold dread hair falls online and at craft fairs and markets throughout Wales. Career = Modelling and inspiration= Early in her modelling career, Kato modelled for Toxico clothing with Ulorin Vex, and later with Chad Michael Ward. In 2004 she began designing and making outfits that had a Neo-Victorian and post-apocalyptic vibe, then modelled them herself and posted them on MySpace. Her inspiration at that time was the 1800s meets Mad Max and Tank Girl, but she didn't know what to call her style until former Abney Park vocalist Magdalene Veen noticed her work and pointed out \\"how Steampunk\\" her illustrations and style were. Model Ulorin Vex wearing post-apocalyptic steampunk attire designed by Kato. =Fashion design= In 2007, Kato founded the first steampunk clothing company, \\"Steampunk Couture\\", producing high- quality, custom-fit clothing and accessories catering specifically to the steampunk genre. Her designs incorporate post-apocalyptic and tribal influences as well as sci-fi, shabby chic and Harajuku/Mori girl elements. One of her more popular ensembles, the \\"Vex\\" outfit, was named after model Ulorin Vex, who modelled it on the Steampunk Couture website. In 2006, Kato, then head of steampunk/industrial musician Doctor Steel's fan club, the \\"Army of Toy Soldiers\\", founded Toy Soldiers Unite!, the club's website. Besides running the site as \\"Sergeant Kato\\", she also designed all the club's uniforms, as well as creating the security guard and nurse uniforms worn by Steel's stage performers. In 2011, when Dr. Steel retired, Kato turned over control of Toy Soldiers Unite to its current administrators. In 2010, Kato designed the outfit for the character \\"Enki\\" in John Soares' dieselpunk action series, The Danger Element, as well as playing the voice of the car, the \\"Jitnimobile\\". In 2013, Flirty Girl Collectibles issued a 1/6 scale collectible action figure of her wearing the \\"Vex\\" outfit. In 2014, her Steampunk Couture clothing line became available through DraculaClothing.com. She also consolidated all her businesses and clothing lines under the S Corporation name, \\"Lambee Co.\\", and teamed with fashion designer Vera Iam to create two new lines of shoes and boots. =Other projects= In 2013, Kato started Steamgirl LLC, a multi-media neo-Victorian fashion erotica site and the first subscription site for steampunk erotica. Besides designing the clothing the models on her site wear, she also builds steampunk and neo- Victorian furniture, props, and hardware as well as doing all the hair and makeup for the shoots. Kato is also a writer for Ladies of Steampunk and LoSP Bronze Age magazines, and was featured in LoSP's premiere issue. She also teamed with photographer Chloe Barcelou and launched Mori Girl Clothing, the first Mori Kei clothing company outside Japan. She is currently also working on a graphic novel.

It is subordinate to the regional MVD and the governor of the City of Sevastopol. Background The main Department of Internal Affairs is the executive agency. It is part of the system of Internal Affairs of Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) but is also subordinate to the Sevastopol government. The Directorate's main responsibilities are internal security, human rights and freedoms, the suppression and detection of crime, and protection of public order. The Sevastopol City Police Commissioner is the head of the Police Department. The Commissioner is the police administrator appointed by the Governor of Sevastopol, after approval by the Sevastopol Legislative Council, by recommendation of the President of Russia. Control over the activities of the police is carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the Governor, the Government of Sevastopol and the Sevastopol City Council.

This was the beginning of new developments in the field of protection and law enforcement. Shortly after the October Revolution in 1917, it was decided to create the Protection Commissariat in order to solve problems of control and law enforcement. Later, by order of the chief of the Provincial Police and by the Resolution of Sevastopol Revolutionary Committee, on 21 May 1919, the Commissariat for the Protection of Sevastopol was renamed the Office of Soviet Workers and Peasants' Militsiya, led by Commissioner Mikhail Ivanovich Kanuga. Structurally, the city of Sevastopol was divided into six districts, each headed by a district police chief. The Precinct Enlistment office was renamed the Office of the Head of the District. After the Russian Civil War, the Sevastopol police force was sent to fight gang violence. By Order of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Crimean executive committee No. 094 from 1958, the municipal districts were divided to: Leninsky, Balaclava, and Nakhimovskiy and on 14 January 1976, the Gagarin District was formed. After the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine on 24 August 1991, the Ukrainian Militsiya began a new stage as the police force of a sovereign state. Ukraine inherited the police that existed in the USSR. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine was also inherited from the police of the Ukrainian SSR. Normative-legal acts that regulate their organization and activities required significant changes. The Sevastopol Militsiya was importantly affected by the subsequent restructuring of the Ukrainian police by legislation enacted in 1992. However, in March 2014, the Militsiya in Sevastopol was dissolved and replaced by the Russian Politsiya due to the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation.
